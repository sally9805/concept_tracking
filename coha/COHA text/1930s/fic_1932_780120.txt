 | Byron had never heard . One day about four years ago a negro man came running up to the minister 's house from his cabin on the edge of town immediately behind it , and said that his wife was at childbed . Hightower had no telephone and he told the negro to run next door and call a doctor . He watched the negro go to the gate of the next house . But instead of entering , the negro stood there for a time and then went on up the street toward town , walking ; Hightower knew that the man would walk all the way to town and then spend probably thirty minutes more getting in touch with a doctor , in his fumbling and timeless negro fashion , instead of asking some white woman to telephone for him . Then he went to his kitchen door and he could hear the woman in the not so distant cabin , wailing . He waited no longer . He ran down to the cabin and found that the woman had got out of bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now on her hands and knees on the floor , trying to get back into the bed , screaming and wailing . He got her back into the bed and told her to lie still , frightened her into obeying him , and ran back to his house and took one of the books from the study shelf and got his razor and some cord and ran back to the cabin and delivered the child . But it was already dead ; the doctor when arrived said that she had doubtless injured it when she left the bed where Hightower found her . He also approved of Hightower 's work , and the husband was satisfied too . But it was just too close to that other business , ' Byron thought , even despite the fifteen years between them . ' Because within two days there were those who said that the child was Hightower 's and that he had let it die deliberately . But Byron believed that even the ones who said  | this did not believe it . He believed that the town had had the habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not believe themselves for too long a time to break themselves of it . Because always , ' he thinks , when anything gets to be a habit , it also manages to get a right good distance away from truth and fact . ' And he remembers one evening when he and Hightower were talking together and Hightower said : " They are good people . They must believe what they must believe , especially as it was I who was at one time both master and servant of their believing . And so it is not for me to outrage their believing nor for Byron Bunch to say that they are wrong . Because all that any man can hope for is to be permitted to live quietly among his fellows . " That was soon after Byron had heard the story , shortly after the evening visits to Hightower 's study began and Byron still wondered why the other remained in Jefferson , almost within sight of , and within hearing of , the church which had disowned and expelled him . One evening Byron asked him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mill while other men are taking pleasure down town ? " Hightower said . " I do nt know , " Byron said . " I reckon that 's just my life . " " And I reckon this is just my life , too , " the other said . But I know now why it is , ' Byron thinks . It is because a fellow is more afraid of the trouble he might have than he ever is of the trouble he 's already got . He 'll cling to trouble he 's used to before he 'll risk a change . Yes . A man will talk about how he 'd like to escape from living folks . But it 's the dead folks that do him the damage . It 's the dead ones that lay quiet in one place and do nt try to hold him , that he cant escape from . '  | They have thundered past now and crashed silently on into the dusk ; night has fully come . Yet he still sits at the study window , the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner flickers and glares , so that the bitten shadows of the unwinded maples seem to toss faintly upon the August darkness . From a distance , quite faint though quite clear , he can hear the sonorous waves of massed voices from the church : a sound at once austere and rich , abject and proud , swelling and falling in the quiet summer darkness like a harmonic tide . Then he sees a man approaching along the street . On a week night he would have recognised the figure , the shape , the carriage and gait . But on Sunday evening , and with the echo of the phantom hooves still crashing soundlessly in the duskfilled study , he watches quietly the puny , unhorsed figure moving with that precarious and meretricious cleverness of animals balanced on their hinder legs ; that cleverness of which the man animal is so fatuously proud and which constantly betrays him by means of natural laws like gravity and ice , and by the very extraneous objects which he has himself invented , like motor cars and furniture in the dark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor or pavement ; and he thinks quietly how right the ancients were in making the horse an attribute and symbol of warriors and kings , when he sees the man in the street pass the low sign and turn into his gate and approach the house . He sits forward then , watching the man come up the dark walk toward the dark door ; he hears the man stumble heavily at the dark bottom step . " Byron Bunch , " he says . " In town on Sunday night . Byron Bunch in town on Sunday . "  | 4 THEY sit facing one another across the desk . The study is lighted now , by a greenshaded reading lamp sitting upon the desk . Hightower sits behind it , in an ancient swivel chair , Byron in a straight chair opposite . Both their faces are just without the direct downward pool of light from the shaded lamp . Through the open window the sound of singing from the distant church comes . Byron talks in a flat , level voice , " It was a strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place where a man would be where the chance to do harm could not have found him , it would have been out there at the mill on a Saturday evening . And with the house burning too , right in my face , you might say . It was like all the time I was eating dinner and I would look up now and then and see that smoke and I would think , Well , I wont see a soul out here this evening , anyway . I ai nt going to be interrupted this evening , at least . ' And then I looked up and there she was , with her face all fixed for smiling and with her mouth all fixed to say his name , when she saw that I was n't him . And I never knowed any better than  | to blab the whole thing . " He grimaces faintly . It is not a smile . His upper lip just lifts momentarily , the movement , even the surface wrinkling , travelling no further and vanishing almost at once . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not the worst of it . " " It must have been a strange thing that could keep Byron Bunch in Jefferson over Sunday , " Hightower says . " But she was looking for him . And you helped her to find him . Was n't what you did what she wanted , what she had come all the way from Alabama to find ? " " I reckon I told her , all right . I reckon it ai nt any question about that . With her watching me , sitting there , swolebellied , watching me with them eyes that a man could not have lied to if he had wanted . And me blabbing on , with that smoke right yonder in plain sight like it was put there to warn me , to make me watch my mouth only I never had the sense to see it . " " Oh , " Hightower says . " The house that burned yesterday . But I do nt see any connection between ? Whose house was it ? I saw the smoke , myself , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . " " That old Burden house , " Byron says . He looks at the other . They look at one another . Hightower is a tall man , and he was thin once . But he is not thin now . His skin is the color of flour sacking and his upper body in shape is like a loosely filled sack falling from his gaunt shoulders of its own weight , upon his lap . Then Byron says , " You ai nt heard yet . " The other watches him . He says in a musing tone : " That would be for me to do too . To tell on two days to two folks something they ai nt going to want to hear and that they had n't ought to have to hear at all . "  | " What is this that you think I will not want to hear ? What is it that I have not heard ? " " Not the fire , " Byron says . " They got out of the fire all right . " " They ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again Byron looks at the other for a moment . But Hightower 's face is merely grave and interested . " Brown and Christmas , " Byron says . Still Hightower 's face does not change in expression . " You ai nt heard that , even , " Byron says . " They lived out there . " " Lived out there ? They boarded in the house ? " " No . In a old nigger cabin in the back . Christmas fixed it up three years ago . He 's been living in it ever since , with folks wondering where he slept at night . Then when him and Brown set up together , he took Brown in with him . " " Oh , " Hightower said . " But I do nt see . . . If they were comfortable , and Miss Burden did n't ? " " I reckon they got along . They were selling whiskey , using that old place for a headquarters , a blind . I do nt reckon she knew that , about the whiskey . Leastways , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They say that Christmas started it by himself three years ago , just selling to a few regular customers that did n't even know one another . But when he took Brown in with him , I reckon Brown wanted to spread out . Selling it by the half a pint out of his shirt bosom in any alley and to anybody . Selling what he never drunk , that is . And I reckon the way they got the whiskey they sold would not have stood much looking into . Because about two weeks after Brown quit out at the mill and taken to riding around in that new car for his steady work , he was down town drunk one Saturday night and  | bragging to a crowd in the barbershop something about him and Christmas in Memphis one night , or on a road close to Memphis . Something about them and that new car hid in the bushes and Christmas with a pistol , and a lot more about a truck and a hundred gallons of something , until Christmas come in quick and walked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Christmas saying in that quiet voice of his , that ai nt pleasant and ai nt mad either : You ought to be careful about drinking so much of this Jefferson hair tonic . It 's gone to your head . First thing you know you 'll have a hairlip . ' Holding Brown up he was with one hand and slapping his face with the other . They did n't look like hard licks . But the folks could see the red even through Brown 's whiskers when Christmas ' hand would come away between licks . You come out and get some fresh air , ' Christmas says . You 're keeping these folks from working . ' " He muses . He speaks again : " And there she was , siting there on them staves , watching me and me blabbing the whole thing to her , and her watching me . And then she says , Did he have a little white scar right here by his mouth ? ' " " And Brown is the man , " Hightower says . He sits motionless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is nothing militant in it , nothing of outraged morality . It is as though he were listening to the doings of people of a different race . " Her husband a bootlegger . Well , well , well . " Yet Byron can see in the other 's face something latent , about to wake , of which Hightower himself is unaware , as if something inside the man were trying to warn or prepare him . But Byron thinks that this is just the reflection of what he himself already knows and is about to tell .  | " And so I had already told her before I knew it . And I could have bit my tongue in two , even then , even when I thought that that was all . " He is not looking at the other now . Through the window , faint yet clear , the blended organ and voices come from the distant church , across the still evening . I wonder if he hears it too Byron thinks Or maybe he has listened to it so much and so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nt even need to not listen " And she set there all the evening while I worked , and the smoke dying away at last , and me trying to think what to tell her and what to do . She wanted to go right on out there , for me to tell her the way . When I told her it was two miles she just kind of smiled , like I was a child or something . I done come all the way from Alabama , ' she said . ' I reckon I ai nt going to worry about two miles more . ' And then I told her . . . " His voice ceases . He appears to contemplate the floor at his feet . He looks up . " I lied , I reckon . Only in a way it was not a lie . It was because I knowed there would be folks out there watching the fire , and her coming up , trying to find him . I did n't know myself , then , the other . The rest of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was busy at a job he had , and that the best time to find him would be down town after six o'clock . And that was the truth . Because I reckon he does call it work , carrying all them cold little bottles nekkid against his chest , and if he ever was away from the square it was just because he was a little behind in getting back or had just stepped into a alley for a minute . So I persuaded her to wait and she set there and I went on working , trying to decide what to do . When I think now how worried I was on what little I knowed , now when I know the rest of it , it do nt seem like I had anything then to worry me at all . All day I have been  | thinking how easy it would be if I could just turn back to yesterday and not have any more to worry me than I had then . " " I still can not see what you have to worry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault that the man is what he is for she what she is . You did what you could . All that any stranger could be expected to do . Unless . . . " His voice ceases also . Then it dies away on that inflection , as if idle thinking had become speculation and then something like concern . Opposite him Byron sits without moving , his face lowered and grave . And opposite Byron , Hightower does not yet think love . He remembers only that Byron is still young and has led a life of celibacy and hard labor , and that by Byron 's telling the woman whom he has never seen possesses some disturbing quality at least , even though Byron still believes that it is only pity . So he watches Byron now with a certain narrowness neither cold nor warm , while Byron continues in that flat voice : about how at six o'clock he had still decided on nothing ; that when he and Lena reached the square he was still undecided . And now there begins to come into Hightower 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talks quietly , telling about how he decided . after they reached the square to take Lena on to Mrs Beard 's . And Byron talking quietly , thinking , remembering : It was like something gone through the air , the evening , making the familiar faces of men appear strange , and he , who had not yet heard , without having to know that something had happened which made of the former dilemma of his innocence a matter for children , so that he knew before he knew what had happened , that Lena must not hear about it . He did not even have to be told in words that he had surely  | found the lost Lucas Burch ; it seemed to him now that only the crassest fatuousness and imbecility should have kept him unaware . It seemed to him that fate , circumstance , had , 7 set a warning in the sky all day long in that pillar of yellow smoke , and he too stupid to read it . And so he would not let them tell  --  the men whom they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it  --  lest she hear too . Perhaps he knew at the time that she would have to know , hear , it sooner or later ; that in a way it was her right to know . It just seemed to him that if he could only get her across the square and into a house his responsibility would be discharged . Not responsibility for the evil to which he held himself for no other reason than that of having spent the afternoon with her while it was happening , having been chosen by circumstance to represent Jefferson to her who had come afoot and without money for thirty days in order to reach there . He did not hope nor intend to avoid that responsibility . It was just to give himself and her time to be shocked and surprised . He tells it quietly , fumbling , his face lowered , in his flat , inflectionless voice , while across the desk Hightower watches him with that expression of shrinking and denial . They reached the boarding house at last and entered it . It was as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hall , speaking for the first time : " What is it them men were trying to tell you ? What is it about that burned house ? " " It was n't anything , " he said , his voice sounding dry and light to him . " Just something about Miss Burden got hurt in the fire . " " How got hurt ? How bad hurt ? " " I reckon not bad . Maybe not hurt at all . Just folks talk-  | ing , like as not . Like they will . " He could not look at her , meet her eyes at all . But he could feel her watching him , and he seemed to hear a myriad sounds : voices , the hushed tense voices about the town , about the square through which he had hurried her , where men met among the safe and familiar lights , telling it . The house too seemed filled with familiar sounds , but mostly with inertia , a terrible procrastination as he gazed down the dim hall , thinking Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Then Mrs Beard did come : a comfortable woman , with red arms and untidy grayish hair . " This here is Miz Burch , " he said . His expression was almost a glare : importunate , urgent . " She just got to town from Alabama . She is looking to meet . her husband here . He ai nt come yet . So I brought her here , where she can rest some before she gets mixed up in the excitement of town . She ai nt been in town or talked to anybody yet , and so I thought maybe you could fix her up a place to get rested some before she has to hear talking and . . . " His voice ceased , died , recapitulant , urgent , importunate . Then he believed that she had got his meaning . Later he knew that it was not because of his asking that she refrained from telling what he knew that she had also heard , but because she had already noticed the pregnancy and that she would have kept the matter hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as strange women had been doing for four weeks now . " How long does she aim to stay ? " Mrs Beard said . " Just a night or two , " Byron said . " Maybe just tonight . She 's looking to meet her husband here . She just got in , and she ai nt had time to ask or inquire ? " His voice was still recapitulant , meaningful . Mrs Beard watched him now . He thought that she was still trying to get his mean-  | ing . But what she was doing was watching him grope , believing ( or about to believe ) that his fumbling had a different reason and meaning . Then she looked at Lena again . Her eyes were not exactly cold . But they were not warm . " I reckon she ai nt got any business trying to go anywhere right now , " she said . " That 's what I thought , " Byron said , quickly , eagerly . " With all the talk and excitement she might have to listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you are crowded tonight , I thought she might have my room . " " Yes , " Mrs Beard said immediately . " You 'll be taking out in a few minutes , anyway . You want her to have your room until you get back Monday morning ? " " I ai nt going tonight , " Byron said . He did not look away . " I wont be able to go this time . " He looked straight into cold , already disbelieving eyes , watching her in turn trying to read his own , believing that she read what was there instead of what she believed was there . They say that it is the practiced liar who can deceive . But so often the practiced and chronic liar deceives only himself ; it is the man who all his life has been selfconvicted of veracity whose lies find quickest credence . " Oh , " Mrs Beard said . She looked at Lena again . " Ai nt she got any acquaintances in Jefferson ? " " She do nt know nobody here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alabama . Likely Mr Burch will show up in the morning . " " Oh , " Mrs Beard said . " Where are you going to sleep ? " But she did not wait for an answer . " I ' reckon I can fix her up a cot in my room for tonight . If she wont object to that . " " That 'll be fine , " Byron said . " It 'll be fine . " When the supper bell rang , he was all prepared . He had  | found a chance to speak to Mrs Beard . He had spent more time in inventing that lie than any yet . And then it was not necessary ; that which he was trying to shield was its own protection . " Them men will be talking about it at the table , " Mrs Beard said . " I reckon a woman in her shape ( and having to find a husband named Burch at the same time she thought with dry irony ) ai nt got no business listening to any more of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have all et . " Which Byron did . Lena ate heartily again , with that grave and hearty decorum , almost going to sleep in her plate before she had finished . " It 's right tiring , travelling is , " she explained . " You go set in the parlor and I 'll fix your cot , " Mrs Beard said . " I 'd like to help , " Lena said . But even Byron could see that she would not ; that she was dead for sleep . " You go set in the parlor , " Mrs Beard said . " I reckon Mr Bunch wont mind keeping you company for a minute or two . " " I did n't dare leave her alone , " Byron says . Beyond the desk Hightower has not moved . " And there we was setting , at the very time when it was all coming out down town at the sheriff 's office , at the very time when Brown was telling it all ; about him and Christmas and the whiskey and all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not since he had took Brown for a partner . I reckon the only thing folks wondered about was why Christmas ever took up with Brown . Maybe it was because like not only finds like ; it cant even escape from being found by its like . Even when it 's just like in one thing , because even them two with the same like was different . Christmas dared the law to make money , and Brown dared the law because he never  | even had sense enough to know he was doing it . Like that night in the barbershop and him drunk and talking loud until Christmas kind of run in and dragged him out . And Mr Maxey said , What do you reckon that was he pretty near told on himself and that other one ? ' and Captain McLendon said , I do nt reckon about it at all , ' and Mr Maxey said , Do you reckon they was actually holding up somebody else 's liquor truck ? ' and McLendon said , Would it surprise you to hear that that fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life ? ' " That 's what Brown was telling last night . But everybody knew about that . They had been saying for a good while that somebody ought to tell Miss Burden . But I reckon there was n't anybody that wanted to go out there and tell her , because nobody knowed what was going to happen then . I reckon there are folks born here that never even saw her . I do nt reckon I 'd wanted to go out there to that old house where nobody ever saw her unless maybe it was folks in a passing wagon that would see her now and then standing in the yard in a dress and sunbonnet that some nigger women I know would n't have wore for its shape and how it made her look . Or maybe she already knew it . Being a Yankee and all , maybe she did n't mind . And then could n't nobody have known what was going to happen . " And so I did n't dare leave her alone until she was in bed . I aimed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I never dared to leave her . Them other boarders was passing up and down the hall and I did n't know when one of them would take a notion to come in and start talking about it and tell the whole thing ; I could already hear them talking about it on the porch , and her still watching me  | with her face all fixed to ask me again about that fire . And so I did n't dare leave her . And we was setting there in the parlor and she could n't hardly keep her eyes open then , and me telling her how I would find him for her all right , only I wanted to come and talk to a preacher I knowed that could help her to get in touch with him . And her setting there with her eyes closed while I was telling her , not knowing that I knew that her and that fellow was n't married yet . She thought she had fooled everybody . And she asked me what kind of a man it was that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her setting there with her eyes closed so that at last I said , You ai n't heard a word I been saying ' and she kind of roused up , but without opening her eyes , and said , Can he still marry folks ? ' and I said , What ? Can he what ? ' and she said , Is he still enough of a preacher to marry folks ? ' " Hightower has not moved . He sits erect behind the desk , his forearms parallel upon the armrests of the chair . He wears neither collar nor coat . His face is at once gaunt and flabby ; it is as though there were two faces , one imposed upon the other , looking out from beneath the pale , bald skull surrounded by a fringe of gray hair , from behind the twin motionless glares of his spectacles . That part of his torso visible above the desk is shapeless , almost monstrous , with a soft and sedentary obesity . He sits rigid ; on his face now that expression of denial and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says ; " Byron . What is this you are telling me ? " Byron ceases . He looks quietly at the other , with an expression of commiseration and pity . " I knowed you had not heard yet . I knowed it would be for me to tell you . "  | They look at one another . " What is it I have n't heard yet ? " " About Christmas . About yesterday and Christmas . Christmas is part nigger . About him and Brown and yesterday . " " Part negro , " Hightower says . His voice sounds light , trivial , like a thistle bloom falling into silence without a sound , without any weight . He does not move . For a7 moment longer he does not move . Then there seems to come over his whole body , as if its parts were mobile like face features , that shrinking and denial , and Byron sees that the still , flaccid , big face is suddenly slick with sweat . But his voice is light and calm . " What about Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of music from the distant church has long since ceased . Now there is no sound in the room save the steady shrilling of insects and the monotonous sound of Byron ' s ice . Beyond the desk Hightower sits erect . Between his parallel and downturned palms and with his lower body concealed by the desk , his attitude is that of an eastern idol . " It was yesterday morning . There was a countryman coming to town in a wagon with his family . He was the one that found the fire . No : he was the second one to get there , because he told how there was already one fellow there when he broke down the door . He told about how he come into sight of the house and he said to his wife how it was a right smart of smoke coming out of that kitchen , and about how the wagon come on and then his wife said , That house is afire . ' And I reckon maybe he stopped the wagon and they set there in the wagon for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I reckon that after a while he said , It looks like it is . ' And I reckon it was his wife that made him get down and go and see . They do nt know it 's afire , ' she said , I reckon . You go up there and tell them . ' And he got out of the wagon and went up onto the porch and stood there , hollering Hello . Hello ' for a while . He told how he could hear the fire then , inside the house , and then he hit the door a lick with his shoulder and went in and then he found the one that had found that fire first . It was Brown . But the countryman did n't know that . He just said it was a drunk man in the hall that looked like he had just finished falling down the stairs , and the countryman said , Your house is afire , mister , ' before he realised how drunk the man was . And he told how the drunk man kept on saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all afire anyway and there was n't any use trying to save anything from up there . " But the countryman knew there could n't be that much fire upstairs because the fire was all back toward the kitchen . And besides , the man was too drunk to know , anyway . And he told how he suspected there was something wrong from the way the drunk man was trying to keep him from going upstairs . So he started upstairs , and the drunk fellow trying to hold him back , and he shoved the drunk man away and went on up the stairs . He told how the drunk man tried to follow him , still telling him how it was n't anything upstairs , and he said that when he come back down again and thought about the drunk fellow , he was gone . But I reckon it was some time before he remembered to think about Brown again . Because he went on up the stairs and begun hollering again , opening the doors , and then he opened the right door and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no sound in the room save the insects . Beyond the open window the steady insects pulse and beat , drowsy and myriad . " Found her , " Hightower says . " It was Miss Burden he found . " He does not move . Byron does not look at him , he might be contemplating his hands upon his lap while he talks . " She was lying on the floor . Her head had been cut pretty near off ; a lady with the beginning of gray hair . The man said how he stood there and he could hear the fire and there was smoke in the room itself now , like it had done -7 followed him in . And how he was afraid to try to pick her up and carry her out because her head might come clean off . And then he said how he run back down the stairs again and out the front without even noticing that the drunk fellow was gone , and down to the road and told his wife to whip the team on to the nearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he run back around the house to the cistern and he said he was already drawing up a bucket of water before he realised how foolish that was , with the whole back end of the house afire good now . So he run back into the house and up the stairs again and into the room and jerked a cover off the bed and rolled her onto it and caught up the corners and swung it onto his back like a sack of meal and carried it out of the house and laid it down under a tree . And he said that what he was scared of happened . Because the cover fell open and she was laying on her side , facing one way , and her head was turned clean around like she was looking behind her . And he said how if she could just have done that when she was alive , she might not have been doing it now . " Byron ceases and looks , glances once , at the man beyond the desk . Hightower has not moved . His face about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly and steadily . " And the sheriff come out , and the fire department come too . But there was n't nothing it could do because there was n't any water for the hose . And that old house burned all evening and I could see the smoke from the mill and I showed it to her when she come up , because I did n't know then . And they brought Miss Burden to town , and there was a paper at the bank that she had told them would tell what to do with her when she died . It said how she had a nephew in the North where she come from , her folks come from . And they telegraphed the nephew and in two hours they got the answer that the nephew would pay a thousand dollars ' reward for who done it . " And Christmas and Brown were both gone . The sheriff found out how somebody had been living in that cabin , and then right off everybody begun to tell about Christmas and Brown , that had kept it a secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to murder that lady . But nobody could find either one of them until last night . The countryman did n't know it was Brown that he found drunk in the house . Folks thought that him and Christmas had both run , maybe . And then last night Brown showed up . He was sober then , and he come onto the square about eight o'clock , wild , yelling about how it was Christmas that killed her and making his claim on that thousand dollars . They got the officers and took him to the sheriff 's office and they told him the reward would be his all right soon as he caught Christmas and proved he done it . And so Brown told . He told about how Christmas had been living with Miss Burden like man and wife for three years , until Brown and him teamed up . At first , when he moved out to live in the cabin with Christmas , Brown said that Christmas told  | him he had been sleeping in the cabin all the time . Then he said how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told how he heard Christmas get up out of bed and come and stand over Brown 's cot for a while , like he was listening , and then he tiptoed to the door and opened it quiet and went out . And Brown said how he got up and followed Christmas and saw him go up to the big house and go in the back door , like either it was left open for him or he had a key to it . Then Brown come on back to the cabin and got into bed . But he said how he could n't go to sleep for laughing , thinking about how smart Christmas thought he was . And he was laying there when Christmas come back in about a hour . Then he said how he could n't keep from laughing no longer , and he says to Christmas , You old son of a gun . ' Then he said how Christmas got right still in the dark , and how he laid there laughing , telling Christmas how he was n't such a slick one after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas wanted him to , he would take it week about with him paying the house rent . " Then he told how he found out that night that sooner or later Christmas was going to kill her or somebody . He said he was laying there , laughing , thinking that Christmas would just maybe get back in bed again , when Christmas struck a match . Then Brown said he quit laughing and he laid there and watched Christmas light the lantern and set it on the box by Brown 's cot . Then Brown said how he was n't laughing and he laid there and Christmas standing there by the cot , looking down at him . Now you got a good joke , ' Christmas says . You can get a good laugh , telling them in the barbershop tomorrow night . ' And Brown said he did n't know that Christmas was mad and that he  | kind of said something back to Christmas , not meaning to make him mad , and Christmas said , in that still way of his : You do nt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe you ought to sleep more , ' and Brown said , How much more ? ' and Christmas said , Maybe from now on . ' And Brown said how he realised then that Christmas was mad and that it was n't no time to joke him , and he said , Ai nt we buddies ? What would I want to tell something that ai nt none of nt care , neither . But you can trust me . ' And he looked at Brown . Cant you trust me ? ' and Brown said he said Yes : And he told then about how he was afraid that Christmas would kill Miss Burden some night , and the sheriff asked him how come he never reported his fear and Brown said he thought how maybe by not saying nothing he could stay out there and prevent it , without having to bother the officers with it ; and the sheriff kind of grunted and said that was thoughtful of Brown and that Miss Burden would sholy appreciate it if she knowed . And then I reckon it begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rat smell too . Because he started in telling about how it was Miss Burden that bought Christmas that auto and how he would try to persuade Christmas to quit selling whiskey before he got them both into trouble ; and the officers watching him and him talking faster and faster and more and more ; about how he had been awake early Saturday morning and saw Christmas get up about dawn and go out . And Brown knew where Christmas was going , and about seven o'clock Christmas come back into the cabin and stood there , looking at Brown . I 've done it , ' Christmas says . Done what ? ' Brown says . Go up to the house and see , ' Christmas says .  | And Brown said how he was afraid then , but that he never suspected the truth . He just said that at the outside all he expected was that maybe Christmas just beat her some . And he said how Christmas went out again and then he got up and dressed and he was making a fire to cook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said how all the kitchen was afire tip at the big house . " What time was this ? ' the sheriff says . " About eight o'clock , I reckon , ' Brown says . When a man would naturally be getting up . Unless he is rich . And God knows I ai nt that . ' " And that fire was n't reported until nigh eleven o'clock , ' the sheriff says . And that house was still burning at three P.M. You mean to say a old wooden house , even a big one , would need six hours to burn down in ? ' " And Brown was setting there , looking this way and that , with them fellows watching him in a circle , hemming him in . I 'm just telling you the truth , ' Brown says . That 's what you asked for . ' He was looking this way and that , jerking his head . Then he kind of hollered : How do I know what time it was ? Do you expect a man doing the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to own a watch ? ' " You ai nt worked at no sawmill nor at anything else in six weeks , ' the marshal says . And a man that can afford to ride around all day long in a new car can afford to pass the courthouse often enough to see the clock and keep up with the time .

I ai nt going to meddle in what ai nt none of my business . I ai nt never done that yet , that I know of .

You 'd have been scared too , until the folks you was trying to help turned in and accused you of the killing you never done . ' And there he sat , with his eyes going and going , and them in the room watching him and the faces pressed against the window from outside . " A nigger , ' the marshal said . I always thought there was something funny about that fellow . ' " Then the sheriff talked to Brown again . And that 's why you did n't tell what was going on out there until to-night ?

You go on with Buck , now , and get a good sleep . I 'll attend to Christmas . ' " I reckon that means the jail , ' Brown says . I reckon you 'll lock me up in jail while you get the reward . ' " You shut your mouth , ' the sheriff says , not mad . If  | that reward is yours , I 'll see that you get it . Take him on , Buck .

When they went out the door the ones that had been watching through the window crowded up : Have you got him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' " No , ' Buck says . You boys get on home . Get on to bed , now . ' " Byron 's voice ceases . Its flat , inflectionless , countrybred singsong dies-Unto silence . He is now looking at Hightower with that look compassionate and troubled and stir , watching across the desk the man who sits there with his eyes closed and the sweat running down his face like tears . Hightower speaks : " Is it certain , proved , that he has negro blood ? Think , Byron ; what it will mean when the people ? if they catch . . . Poor man . Poor mankind . " " That 's what Brown says , " Byron says , his tone quiet , stubborn , convinced . " and even a liar can be scared into telling the truth , same as a honest man can be tortured into telling a lie7 " " Yes , " Hightower says . He sits with his eyes closed , erect . " But they have not caught him yet . They have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at the other . " Not yet . Not the last I heard . They took some bloodhounds out there today . But they had n't caught him when I heard last . " " And Brown ? " " Brown , " Byron says . " Him . He went with them . He may have helped Christmas do it . But I do nt reckon so . I reckon that setting fire to the house was about his limit . And why he done that , if he did , I reckon even he do nt know . Unless maybe he thought that if the whole thing was just burned up , it would kind of not ever been at all ,  | and then him and Christmas could go on riding around in that new car .

Kind of a murderer trying to catch himself to get his own reward . He do nt seem to mind though , except to begrudge the time while they ai nt out on the trail , the time wasted setting down . Yes . I 'll tell her tomorrow . I 'll just tell her that he is in hock for the time being , him and them two dogs .

Here I have come clean from Alabama , and now I am in Jefferson at last , sure enough . ' "  | 5 IT was after midnight . Though Christmas had been in bed for two hours , he was not yet asleep . He heard Brown before he saw him . H'e heard Brown approach the door and then blunder into it , in silhouette propping himself erect in the door . Brown was breathing heavily . Standing there between his propped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nasal tenor . The very longdrawa pitch of his voice seemed to smell of whiskey . " Shut it , " Christmas said . He did not move and his voice was not raised . Yet Brown ceased at once . He stood for a moment longer in the door , propping himself upright . Then he let go of the door and Christmas heard him stumble into the room ; a moment later he blundered into something . There was an interval filled with hard , labored breathing . Then Brown fell to the floor with a tremendous clatter , striking the cot on which Christmas lay and filling the room with loud and idiot laughter . Christmas rose from his cot . Invisible beneath him Brown lay on the floor , laughing , making no effort to rise . " Shut it ! " Christmas said . Brown still laughed Christmas stepped  | across Brown and put his hand out toward where a wooden box that served for table sat , on which the lantern and matches were kept . But he could not find the box , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown fell . He stooped , astride Brown , and found his collar and hauled him out from beneath the cot and raised Brown 's head and began to strike him with his flat hand , short , vicious , and hard , until Brown ceased laughing . Brown was limp . Christmas held his head up , cursing him in a voice level as whispering . He dragged Brown over to the other cot and flung him onto it , face up . Brown began to laugh again . Christmas put his hand flat upon Brown 's mouth and nose , shutting his jaw with his left hand while with the right he struck Brown again with those hard , slow , measured blows , as if he were meting them out by count . Brown had stopped laughing . He struggled . Beneath Christmas 's hand he began to make a choked , gurgling noise , struggling . Christmas held him until he ceased and became still . Then Christmas slacked his hand a little . " Will you be quiet now ? " he said . " Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black hand off of me , you damn niggerblooded ? " The hand shut down again . Again Christmas struck him with the other hand upon the face . Brown ceased and lay still again . Christmas slacked his hand . After a moment Brown spoke , in a tone cunning , not loud : " You 're a nigger , see ? You said so yourself . You told me . But I 'm white . I 'm a wh ? " The hand shut down . Again Brown struggled , making a choked whimpering sound beneath the hand , drooling upon the fingers . When he stopped struggling , the hand slacked . Then he lay still , breathing hard .  | " Will you now ? " Christmas said . " Yes , " Brown said . He breathed noisily . " Let me breathe . I 'll be quiet . Let me breathe . " Christmas slacked his hand but he did not remove it . Beneath it Brown breathed easier , his breath came and went easier , with less noise . But Christmas did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prone body , with Brown 's breath alternately hot and cold on his fingers , thinking quietly Something is going to happen to me.7 I am going to do something Without removing his left hand from Brown 's face he could reach with his right across to his cot , to his pillow beneath which lay his razor with its five inch blade . But he did not do it . Perhaps thinking had already gone far enough and dark enough to tell him This is not the right one Anyway he did not reach for the razor . After a time he removed his hand from Brown 's face . But he did not go away . He still stood above the cot , his own breathing so quiet , so calm , as to make no sound even to himself . Invisible too , Brown breathed quieter now , and after a while Christmas returned and sat upon his cot and fumbled . a cigarette and a match from his trousers hanging on the wall . In the flare of the match Brown was visible . Before taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown . Brown lay on his back , sprawled , one arm dangling to the floor . His mouth was open . While Christmas watched , he began to snore . Christmas lit the cigarette and snapped the match toward the open door , watching the flame vanish in midair . Then he was listening for the light , trivial sound which the dead match would make when it struck the floor ; and then it seemed to him that he heard it . Then it seemed to him , sitting on the cot in the dark room , that he was hearing a  | myriad sounds of no greater volume  --  voices , murmurs , whispers : of trees , darkness , earth ; people : his own voice ; other voices evocative of names and times and places ? which he had been conscious of all his life without knowing it , which were his life , thinking God perhaps and me not knowing that too He could see it like a printed sentence , fullborn and already dead God loves me too like the faded and weathered letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He smoked the cigarette down without once touching it with his hand . He snapped it too toward-the door . Unlike the match , it did not vanish in midflight . He watched it twinkle end over end through the door . He lay back on the cot , his hands behind his head , as a man lies who does not expect to sleep , thinking I have been in bed now since ten o'clock and I have not gone to sleep . I do not know what time it is but it is later than midnight and I have not yet been asleep " It 's because she started praying over me , " he said . He spoke aloud , his voice sudden and loud in the dark room , above Brown 's drunken snoring . " That 's it . Because she started praying over me . " He rose from the cot . His bare feet made no sound . He stood in the darkness , in his underclothes . On the other cot Brown snored . For a moment Christmas stood , his head turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . In his underclothes and barefoot he left the cabin . It was a little lighter outdoors . Overhead the slow constellations wheeled , the stars of which he had been aware for thirty years and not one of which had any name to him or meant anything at all by shape or brightness or position . Ahead , rising from out a close mass of trees , he could see one chimney and one gable of the house . The house itself  | was invisible and dark . No light shown and no sound came from it when he approached and stood beneath the window of the room where she slept , thinking If she is asleep too . If she is asleep The doors were never locked , and it used to be that at whatever hour between dark and dawn that the desire took him , he would enter the house and go to her bedroom and take his sure way through the darkness to her bed . Sometimes she would be awake and waiting and she would speak his name . At others he would waken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as hard and as brutally before she was good awake . That was two years ago , two years behind them now , thinking Perhaps that is where outrage lies . Perhaps I believe that I have been tricked , fooled . That she lied to me about her age , about what happens to women at 4 certain age He said , aloud , solitary , in the darkness beneath the dark window : " She ought not to started praying over me . She would have been all right if she had n't started praying over me . It was not her fault that she got too old to be any good any more . But she ought to have had better sense than to pray over me . " He began to curse her . He stood beneath the dark window , cursing her with slow and calculated obscenity . He was not looking at the window . In the less than halflight he appeared to be watching his body , seeming to watch it turning slow and lascivious in a whispering of gutter filth like a drowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . He touched himself with his flat hands , hard , drawing his hands hard up his abdomen and chest inside his undergarment . It was held together by a single button at the top . Once he had owned garments with intact buttons . A woman had sewed them on . That was for a time , during a time . Then the time passed . After  | that he would purloin his own garments from the family wash before she could get to them and replace the missing buttons . When she foiled him he set himself deliberately to learn and remember which buttons were missing and had been restored . With his pocket knife and with the cold and bloodless deliberation of a surgeon he would cut off the buttons which she had just replaced . His right hand slid fast and smooth as the knife blade had ever done , up the opening in the garment . Edgewise it struck the remaining button a light , swift blow . The dark air breathed upon him ; breathed smoothly as the garment slipped down his legs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moving again , he could feel the dark air like water ; he could feel the dew under his feet as he had never felt dew before . He passed through the broken gate and stopped beside the road . The August weeds were thightall . Upon the leaves and stalks dust of a month of passing wagons lay . The road ran before him . It was a little paler than the darkness of trees and earth . In one direction town lay . In the other the road rose to a hill . After a time a light began to grow beyond the hill , defining it . Then he could hear the car . He did not move . He stood with his hands on his hips , naked , thighdeep in the dusty weeds , while the car came over the hill and approached , the lights full upon him . He watched his body grow white out of the darkness like a kodak print emerging from the liquid . He looked straight into the headlights as it shot past . From it a woman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " he shouted . " That 's not the first of your bitches that ever saw . . . " But the car was gone . There was no one to hear , to listen . It was gone , sucking its dust and its light with it and behind it , sucking with it the  | white woman 's fading cry . He was cold now . It was as though he had merely come there to be present at a finality , and the finality had now occurred and he was free again . He returned to the house . Beneath the dark window he paused and hunted and found his undergarment and put it on . There was no remaining button at all now and he had to hold it together as he returned to the cabin . Already he could hear Brown snoring . He stood for a while at the door , motionless and silent , listening to the long , harsh , uneven suspirations ending each in a choked gurgle . I must have hurt his nose more than I knew , ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered and went to his cot , preparing to lie down . He was in the act of reclining when he stopped , halted , halfreclining . Perhaps the thought of himself lying there until daylight , with the drunken man snoring in the darkness and the intervals filled with the myriad voices , was more than he could bear . Because he sat up and fumbled quietly beneath his cot and found his shoes and slipped them on and took from the cot the single half cotton blanket which composed his bedding , and left the cabin . About three hundred yards away the stable stood . It was falling down and there had not been a horse in it in thirty years , yet it was towarc ' the stable that he went . He was walking quite fast . He was thinking now , aloud now , Why in hell do I want to smell horses ? ' Then he said , fumbling : " It 's because they are not women . Even a mare horse is a kind of man . " He slept less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lying in the single blanket upon the loosely planked floor of the sagging and gloomy cavern acrid with the thin dust of departed hay and faintly ammoniac with  | that breathless desertion of old stables , he could see through the shutterless window in the eastern wall the primrose sky and the high , pale morning star of full summer . He felt quite rested , as if he had slept an unbroken eight hours . It was the unexpected sleep , since he had not expected to sleep at all . With his feet again in the unlaced shoes and the folded blanket beneath his arm he descended the perpendicular ladder , feeling for the rotting and invisible rungs with his feet , lowering himself from rung to ru in onehanded swoops . He emerged into the gray and ellow ) of dawn , the clean chill , breathing it deep . The cabin now stood sharp against the increasing east , and the clump of trees also within which the house was hidden save for the single chimney . The dew was heavy in the tall grass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his feet ; against his bare legs the wet grass blades were like strokes of limber icicles . Brown had stopped snoring . When Christmas entered he could see Brown by the light from the eastern window . He breathed quietly now . Sober now , ' Christmas thought . Sober and do nt know it . Poor bastard . ' He looked at Brown . Poor bastard . He 'll be mad when he wakes up and finds out that he is sober again . Take him maybe a whole hour to get back drunk again . ' He put down the blanket and dressed , in the serge trousers , the white shirt a little soiled now , the bow tie . He was smoking . Nailed to the wall was a shard of mirror . In the fragment he watched his dim face as he knotted the tie . The stiff hat hung on a nail . He did not take it down . He took instead a cloth cap from another nail , and from the floor beneath his cot a magazine of that type whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures of men in the act of  | shooting one another with pistols . From beneath the pillow on his cot he took his razor and a brush and a stick of shaving soap and put them into his pocket . When he left the cabin it was quite light . The birds were in full chorus . This time he turned his back on the house . He went on past the stable and entered the pasture beyond it . His shoes and his trouser legs were soon sopping with gray dew . He paused and rolled his trousers gingerly to his knees and went on . At the end of the pasture woods began . The dew was not so heavy here , and he rolled his trousers down again . After a while he came to a small valley in which a spring rose . He put down the magazine and gathered twigs and dried brush and made a fire and sat , his back against a tree and his feet to the blaze . Presently his wet shoes began to steam . Then he could feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sudden he opened his eyes and saw the high sun and that the fire had burned completely out , and he knew that he had been asleep . Damned if I have n't , ' he thought . Damned if I have n't slept again . ' He had slept more than two hours this time , because the sun was shining down upon the spring itself , glinting and glancing upon the ceaseless water . He rose , stretching his cramped and stiffened back , waking his tingling muscles . From his pocket he took the razor , the brush , the soap . Kneeling beside the spring he shaved , using the water 's surface for glass , stropping the long bright razor on his shoe . He concealed the shaving things and the magazine in a clump of bushes and put on the tie again . When he left the spring he bore now well away from the house . When he reached the road he was a half mile beyond the house .  | A short distance further on stood a small store with a gasoline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman sold him crackers and a tin of potted meat . He returned to the spring , the dead fire . He ate his breakfast with his back against the tree , reading the magazine while he ate . He had previously read but one story ; he began now upon the second one , reading the magazine straight through as though it were a novel . Now and then he would look up from the page , chewing , into the sunshot leaves which arched the ditch . Maybe I have already done it , ' he thought . Maybe it is no longer now waiting to be done . ' It seemed to him that he could see the el o ) v day opening peacefully on before him , like a corridor , an arras , into a still chiaroscuro without urgency . It seemed to him that as he sat there the yellow day contemplated him drowsily , like a prone and somnolent yellow cat . Then he read again . He turned the pages in steady progression , though now and then he would seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word . He would not look up then . He would not move , apparently arrested and held immobile by a single word which had perhaps not yet impacted , his whole being suspended by the single trivial combination of letters in quiet and sunny space , so that hanging motionless and without physical weight he seemed to watch the slow flowing of time beeath him , thinking All I wanted was peace thinking , She ought not to started praying over me . ' When he reached the last story he stopped reading and counted the remaining pages . Then he looked at the sun and read again . He read now like a man walking along a street might count the cracks in the pavement , to the last and final page , the last and final word . Then he rose and  | struck a match to the magazine and prodded it patiently until it was consumed . With the shaving things in his pocket he went on down the ditch . After a while it broadened : a smooth , sandblanched floor between steep shelving walls choked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over it trees still arched , and in a small cove in one flank a mass of dead brush lay , filling the cove . He began to drag the brush to one side , clearing the cove and exposing a short handled shovel . With the shovel he began to dig in the sand which the brush had concealed , exhuming one by one six metal tins with screw tops . He did not unscrew the caps . He laid the tins on their sides and with the sharp edge of the shovel he pierced them , the sand beneath them darkening as the whiskey spurted and poured , the sunny solitude , the air , becoming redolent with alcohol . He emptied them thoroughly , unhurried , his face completely cold , masklike almost . When they were all empty he tumbled them back into the hole and buried them roughly and dragged the brush back and hid the shovel again . The brush hid the stain but it could not hide the scent , the smell . He looked at the sun again . It was now afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a restaurant on a side street , eating his supper , sitting on a backless stool at , a frictionsmooth wooden counter , eating . At nine o'clock he was standing outside the barbershop , looking through the window at the man whom he had taken for a partner . He stood quite still , with his hands in his trousers and cigarette smoke drifting across his still face and the cloth cap worn , like the stiff hat , at that angle at once swaggering and baleful . So cold , so baleful he stood  | there that Brown inside the shop , among the lights , the air heavy with lotion and hot soap , gesticulant , thickvoiced , in the soiled redbarred trousers and the soiled colored shirt , looked up in midvoice and with his drunken eyes looked into the eyes of the man beyond the glass . So still and baleful that a negro youth shuffling up the street whistling saw Christmas ' profile and ceased whistling and edged away and slid past behind him , turning , looking back over his shoulder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he had just paused there for Brown to look at him . He went on , not fast , away from the square . The street , a quiet one at all times , was deserted at this hour . It led down through the negro section , Freedman Town , to the station . At seven o'clock he would have passed people , white and black , going toward the square and the picture show ; at half past nine they would have been going back home . But the picture show had not turned out yet , and he now had the street to himself . He went on , passing still between the homes of white people , from street lamp to street lamp , the heavy shadows of oak and maple leaves sliding like scraps of black velvet across his white shirt . Nothin can look quite as lonely as a big man going along an street . Yet though he was not large , not tall , he contri ed somehow to look more lonely than a lone telephone pole in the middle of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked like a phantom , a spirit , str , ayed out of its own world , and lost . Then he found himself . Without his being aware the street had begun to slope and before he knew it he was in Freedman Town , surrounded by the summer smell and the summer voices of invisible negroes . They seemed to enclose him like bodiless voices murmuring , talking , laugh-  | ing , in a language not his . As from the bottom of a thick black pit he saw himself enclosed by cabinshapes , vague , kerosenelit , so that the street lamps themselves seemed to be further spaced , as if the black life , the black breathing had compounded the substance of breath so that not only voices but moving bodies and light itself must become fluid and accrete slowly from particle to particle , of and with the now ponderable night inseparable and one . He was standing still now , breathing quite hard , glaring this way and that . About him the cabins were shaped blackly out of blackness by the faint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even within him , the bodiless fecundmellow voices of negro women murmured . It was as though he and all other manshaped life about him had been returned to the lightless hot wet primogenitive Female . He began to run , glaring , his teeth glaring , his inbreath cold on his dry teeth and lips , toward the next street lamp . Beneath it a narrow and rutted lane turned and mounted to the parallel street , out of the black hollow . He turned into it running and plunged up the sharp ascent , his heart hammering , and into the higher street . He stopped here , panting , glaring , his heart thudding as if it could not or would not yet believe that the air now was the cold hard air of white people . Then he became cool . The negro smell , the negro voices , were behind and below him now . To his left lay the square , the clustered lights : low bright birds in stillwinged and tremulous suspension . To the right the street lamps marched on , spaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , slowly again , his back toward the square , passing again between the houses of white people . There were people on these porches too , and in chairs upon  | the lawns ; but he could walk quiet here . Now and then he could see them : heads in silhouette , a white blurred garmented shape ; on a lighted veranda four people sat about a card table , the white faces intent and sharp in the low light , the bare arms of the women glaring smooth and white above the trivial cards . That 's all I wanted , ' he thought . That do nt seem like a whole lot to ask . ' This street in turn began to slope . But it sloped safely . His steady white shirt and pacing dark legs died among long shadows bulging square and huge against the August stars : a cotton warehouse , a horizontal and cylindrical tank like the torso of a beheaded mastodon , a line of freight cars . He crossed the tracks , the rails coming momentarily into twin green glints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tracks woods began . But he found the path unerringly . It mounted , among the trees , the lights of the town now beginning to come into view again across the valley where the railroad ran . But he did not look back until he reached the crest of the hill . Then he could see the town , the glare , the individual lights where streets radiated from the square . He could see the street down which he had come , and the other street , the one which had almost betrayed him ; and further away and at right angles , the far bright rampart of the town itself , and in the angle between the black pit from which he had fled with drumming heart and glaring lips . No light came from it , from here no breath , no odor . It just lay there , black , impenetrable , in its garland of Augusttremulous lights . It might have been the original quarry , abyss itself . His way was sure , despite the trees , the darkness . He never once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The woods continued for a mile . He emerged into a road , with  | dust under his feet . He could see now , the vague spreading world , the horizon . Here and there faint windows glowed . But most of the cabins were dark . Nevertheless his blood began again , talking and talking . He walked fast , in time to it ; he seemed to be aware that the group were negroes before he could have seen or heard them at all , before they even came in sight vaguely against the defunctive dust . There were five or six of them , in a straggling body yet vaguely paired ; again there reached him , above the noise of his own blood , the rich murmur of womenvoices . He was walking directly toward them , walking fast . They had seen him and they gave to one side of the road , the voices ceasing . He too changed direction , crossing toward them as if he intended to walk them down . In a single movement and as though at a spoken command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving him a wide berth . One of the men followed them as if he were driving them before him , looking over his shoulder as he passed . The other two men had halted in the road , facing Christmas . Christmas had stopped also . Neither seemed to be moving , yet they approached , looming , like two shadows drifting up . He could smell negro ; he could smell cheap cloth and swea6 The head of the negro , higher than his own , seemed to stoop , out of the sky , against the sky . " It 's a white man , " he said , without turning his head , quietly . " What you want , whitefolks ? You looking for somebody ? " The voice was not threatful . Neither was it servile . " Come on away from there , Jupe , " the one who had followed the women said . " Who you looking for , cap 'm ? " the negro said . " Jupe , " one of the women said , her voice a little high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment longer the two heads , the light and the  | dark , seemed to hang suspended in the darkness , breathing upon one another . Then the negro 's head seemed to float away ; a cool wind blew from somewhere . Christmas , turning slowly , watching them dissolve and fade again into the pale road , found that he had the razor in his hand . It was not open . It was not from fear . " Bitches ! " he said , quite loud . " Sons of bitches ! " The wind blew dark and cool ; the dust even through his shoes was cool . What in hell is the matter with me ? ' he thought . He put the razor back into his pocket and stopped and lit a cigarette . He had to moisten his lips several times to hold the cigarette . In the light of the match he could watch his own hands shake . All this trouble , ' he thought . " All this damn trouble , " he said aloud , walking again . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be near ten now , ' he thought ; and then almost with the thought he heard the clock on the courthouse two miles away . Slow , measured , clear the ten strokes came . He counted them , stopped again in the lonely and empty road . Ten o'clock , ' he thought . I heard ten strike last night too . And eleven . And twelve . But I did n't hear one . Maybe the wind had changed . ' When he heard eleven strike tonight he was sitting with his back against a tree inside the broken gate , while behind him again the house was dark and hidden in its shaggy grove . He was not thinking Maybe she is not asleep either tonight . He was not thinking at all now ; thinking had not begun now ; the voices had not begun now either . He just sat there , not moving , until after a while he heard the clock two miles away strike twelve . Then he rose and moved toward the house . He did n't go fast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen . Something is going to happen to me  | 6 MEMORY believes before knowing remembers . Believes longer than recollects , longer than knowing even wonders . Knows remembers believes a corridor in a big long garbled cold echoing building of dark red brick sootbleakened by more chimneys than its own , set in a grassless cinderstrewnpacked compound surrounded by smoking factory purlieus and enclosed by a ten foot steeland-wire fence like a penitentiary or a zoo , where in random erratic surges , with sparrowlike childtrebling , orphans in identical and uniform blue denim in and out of remembering but in knowing constant as the bleak walls , the bleak windows where in rain soot from the yearly adjacenting chimneys streaked like black tears . In the quiet and empty corridor , during the quiet hour of early afternoon , he was like a shadow , small even for five years , soJZer and quiet as shadow . Another in the corridor could not have said just when and where he vanished , into what door , what room . But there was no one else in the corridor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been doing this for almost a year , ever since the day when  | he discovered by accident the toothpaste which the dietitian used . Once in the room , he event directly on his bare and silent feet to the washstand and found the tube . He was watching the pink worm coill and slow onto his parchmentcolored finger when he heard footsteps in the corridor and then voices just beyond the door . Perhaps he recognised the dietitian 's voice . Anyway , he did not wait to see if they were going to pass the door or not . With the tube in his hand and still silent as a shadow on his bare feet he crossed the room and slipped beneath a cloth curtain which screened off one corner of the room . Here he squatted , among delicate shoes and suspended soft womangarments . Crouching , he heard the dietitian and her companion enter the room . The dietitian was nothing to him yet , save a mechanical adjunct to eating , food , the diningroom , the ceremony of eating at the wooden forms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all except as something of pleasing association and pleasing in herself to look at ? young , a little fullbodied , smooth , pink-and-white , making his mind think of the diningroom , making his mouth think of something sweet and sticky to eat , and also pinkcolored and surreptitious . On that first day when he discovered the toothpaste in her room he had gone directly there , who had never heard of toothpaste either , as if he already knew that she would possess something of that nature and he would find it . He knew the voice of her companion also . It was that of a young interne from the county hospital who was assistant to the parochial doctor , he too a familiar figure about the house and also not yet an enemy . He was safe now , behind the curtain . When they went  | away , he would replace the toothpaste and also leave . So he squatted behind the curtain , hearing without listening to it the woman 's tense whispering voice : " No ! No ! Not here . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , Charley ! Please ! " The man 's words he could not understand at all . The voice was lowered too . It had a ruthless sound , as the voices of all men d him yet , since he was too young yet to escape froomthie id world of women for that brief respite before he escaped back into it to remain until the hour of his death . He heard other sounds which he did know : a scuffing as of feet , the turn of the key in the door . " No , Charley ! Charley , please ! Please , Charley ! " the woman 's whisper said . He heard other sounds , rustlings , whisperings , not voices . He was not listening ; he was just waiting , thinking without particular interest or attention that it was a strange hour to be going to bed . Again the woman 's fainting whisper came through the thin curtain : " I 'm scared ! Hurry ! Hurry ! " He squatted among the soft womansmelling garments and the shoes . He saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By taste and not seeing he contemplated the cool invisible worm as it coiled onto his finger and smeared sharp , automatonlike and sweet , into his mouth . By ordinary he would have taken a single mouthful and then replaced the tube and left the room . Even at five , he knew that he must not take more than that . Perhaps it was the animal warning him that more would make him sick ; perhaps the human being warning him that if he took more than that , she would miss it . This was the first time he had taken more . By now , hiding and waiting , he had taken a good deal more . By feel he could see the diminishing tube . He began to sweat . Then he found that he  | had been sweating for some time , that for some time now he had been doing nothing else but sweating . He was not hearing anything at all now . Very likely he would not have heard a gunshot beyond the curtain . He seemed to be turned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another worm of paste into his mouth which his stomach did not want . Sure enough , it refused to go down . Motionless now , utterly contemplative , he seemed to stoop above himself like a chemist in his laboratory , waiting . He did n't have to wait long . At once the paste which he had already swallowed lifted inside him , trying to get back out , into the air where it was cool . It was no longer sweet . In the rife , pinkwomansmelling obscurity behind the curtain he squatted , pinkfoamed , listening to his insides , waiting with astonished fatalism for what was about to happen to him . Then it happened . He said to himself with complete and passive surrender : Well , here I am . ' When the curtain fled back he did not look up . When hands dragged him violently out of his vomit he did not resist . He hung from the hands , limp , looking with slackjawed and glassy idiocy into a face no longer smooth pinkand-white , surrounded now by wild and dishevelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You little rat ! " the thin , furious voice hissed ; " you little rat ! Spying on me ! You little nigger bastard ! " The dietitian was twentyseven  --  old enough to have to take a few amorous risks but still young enough to attach a great deal of importance not so much to love , but to being caught at it . She was also stupid enough to believe that a child of five not only could deduce the truth from  | what he had heard , but that he would want to tell it as an adult would . So when during the following two days she could seem to look nowhere and be nowhere without finding the child watching her with the profound and intent interrogation of an animal , she foisted upon him more of the attributes of an adult : she believed that he not only intended to tell , but that he deferred doing it deliberately in order to make her suffer more . It never occurred to her that he believed that he was the one who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that he was putting himself in her way in order to get it over with , get his whipping and strike the balance and write it off . By the second day she was well nigh desperate . She did not sleep at night . She lay most of the night now tense , teeth and hands clenched , panting with fury and terror and worst of all , regret : that blind fury to turn back time just for an hour , a second . This was to the exclusion of even love during the time . The young doctor was now even less than the child , merely an instrument of her disaster and not even that of her salvation . She could not have said which she hated most . She could not even say when she was asleep and when she was awake . Because always against her eyelids or upon her retina ' was that still , grave , inescapable , parchmentcolored face watching her . On the third day she came out of the coma state , the waking sleep through which during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face like an aching mask in a fixed grimace of dissimulation that dared not flag . On the third day she acted . She had no trouble finding him . It was in the corridor , the empty corridor during the quiet hour after dinner . He was there , doing nothing at all . Perhaps he  | had followed her . No one else could have said if he were waiting there or not . But she found him without surprise and he heard and turned and saw her without surprise : the two faces , the one no longer smooth pink-and-white , the other grave , sobereyed , perfectly empty of everything except waiting . Now I 'll get it over with , ' he thought . " Listen , " she said . Then she stopped , looking at him . It was as though she could not think what to say next . The child waited , still , motionless . Slowly and gradually the muscles of his backside were becoming flat and rigid and tense as boards . " Are you going to tell ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that anyone should have known that the last thing in the world he would do would be to tell about the toothpaste , the vomit . He was not looking at her face . He was watching her hands , waiting . One of them was clenched inside her skirt pocket . Through the cloth he could see that it was clenched hard . He had never been struck with a fist . Yet neither had he ever waited three days to be punished . When he saw the hand emerge from the pocket he believed that she was about to strike him . But she did not ; the hand just opened beneath his eyes . Upon it lay a silver dollar . Her voice was thin , urgent , whispering , though the corridor was empty about them . " You can buy a lot with this . A whole dollar . " He had never seen a dollar before , though he knew what it was . He looked at it . He wanted it as he would have wanted the bright cap from a beer bottle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , because he would not give it to her if it were his . He did n't know what she wanted him to do . He was waiting to get whipped and then be released . Her voice went on , urgent , tense , fast : " A whole dollar . See ? How much you could buy . Some to eat every  | day for a week . And next month maybe I 'll give you another one . " He did not move nor speak . He might have been carven , a large toy : small , still , round headed and round eyed , in overalls . He was still with astonishment , shock , outrage . Looking at the dollar , he seemed to see ranked tubes of toothpaste like corded wood , endless and terrifying ; his whole being coiled in a rich and passionate revulsion . " I do nt want no more , " he said . I do nt never want no more , ' he thought . Then he did n't dare even look at her face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuddering breath . Now it 's coining he thought in a flashing instant . But she did n't even shake him . She just held him , hard , not shaking him , as if her hand too did n't know what it wanted to do next . Her face was so near that he could feel her breath on his cheek . He did n't need to look up to know what her face looked like now . " Tell ! " she said . " Tell , then ! You little nigger bastard ! You nigger bastard ! " That was the third day . On the fourth day she became quite calmly and completely mad . She no longer planned at all . Her subsequent actions followed a kind of divination , as if the days and the unsleeping nights during which she had nursed behind that calm mask her fear and fury had turned her psychic along with her natural female infallibility for the spontaneous comprehension of evil . She was quite calm now . She had escaped for the moment from even urgency . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan . Looking about the scene her glance , her mind , her thought , went full and straight and instantaneous to the janitor sitting in the door of the furnace room . There was no ratiocination in it , no design . She  | just seemed to look outside herself for one moment like a passenger in a car , and saw without any surprise at all that small , dirty man sitting in a splint chair in a sootgrimed doorway , reading through steelrimmed spectacles from a book upon his knees  --  a figure , almost a fixture , of which she had been aware for five years now without once having actually looked at him . She would not have recognised his face on the street . She would have passed him without knowing him , even though he was a man . Her life now seemed straight and simple as a corridor with him sitting at the end of it . She went to him at once , already in motion upon the dingy path before she was aware that she had started . He was sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book upon his knees . When she approached she saw that it was the Bible . But she just noticed this , as she might have noticed a fly upon his leg . " You hate him too , " she said . " You 've been " watching him too . I 've seen you . Do nt say you do nt . " He looked up at her face , the spectacles propped now above his brows . He was not an old man . In his present occupation he was an incongruity . He was a hard man , in his prime ; a man who should have been living a hard and active life , and whom time , circumstance , something , had betrayed , sweeping the hale body and thinking of a man of fortyfive into a backwater suitable for a man of sixty or sixtyfive . " You know , " she said . " You knew before the other children started calling him Nigger . You came out here at the same time . You were n't working here a month before that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tell me . " The janitor 's face was round , a little flabby , quite dirty , with a dirty stubble . His eyes were quite clear , quite gray , quite cold . They were  | quite mad too . But the woman did not notice that . Or perhaps they did not look mad to her . So they faced one another in the coalgrimed doorway , mad eyes looking into mad eyes , mad voice talking to mad voice as calm and quiet and terse as two conspirators . " I 've watched you for five years . " She believed that she was telling the truth . " Sitting here in this very chair , watching him . You never sit here except when the children are outdoors . But as soon as they come out , you bring this chair here to the door and sit in it where you can watch them . Watching him and hearing the other children calling him Nigger . That 's what you are doing . I know . You came here just to do that , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he came . Maybe you brought him and left him on the step yonder yourself . But anyway you know . And I 've got to know . When he tells I will be fired . And Charley may ? will ? Tell me . Tell me , now . " " Ah , " the janitor said . " I knowed he would be there to catch you when God 's time came . I knowed . I know who set hind there , a sign and a damnation for bitchery . " " Yes . He was right behind the curtain . As close as you are . You tell me , now . I 've seen your eyes when you look at him . Watched you . For five years . " " I know , " he said . " I know evil . Ai nt I made evil to get up and walk God 's world ? A walking pollution in God 's own face I made it . Out of the mouths of little children He never concealed it . You have heard them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call him in his rightful nature , by the name of his damnation . I never told them . They knowed . They was told , but it was n't by me . I just waited , on His own good time , when He would see fitten to reveal it to  | His living world . And it 's come now . This is the sign , wrote again in womansinning and bitchery . " " Yes . But what must I do ? Tell me . " " Wait . Like I waited . Five years I waited for the Lord to move and show His will . And He done it . You wait too . When He is ready for it He will show His will to them that have the sayso . " " Yes . The sayso . " They glared at one another , still , breathing quietly . " The madam . When He is ready , He will reveal it to her . " " You mean , if the madam knows , she will send him away ? Yes . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurry the Lord God . Ai nt I waited five years ? " She began to beat her hands lightly together . " But do nt you see ? This may be the Lord 's way . For you to tell me . Because you know . Maybe it 's His way for you to tell me and me to tell the madam . " Her mad eyes were quite calm , her mad voice patient and calm : it was only her light unceasing hands . " You 'll wait , the same as I waited , " he said . " You have felt the weight of the Lord 's remorseful hand for maybe three days . I have lived under it for five years , watching and waiting for His own good time , because my sin is greater-than your sin . " Though he was looking directly at her face he did not seem to see her at all , his eyes did not . They looked like they were blind , wide open , icecold , fanatical . " To what I done and what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ womansuffering ai nt no more than a handful of rotten dirt . I done bore mine five years ;  | who are you to hurry Almighty God with your little womanfilth ? " She turned , at once . " Well . You do nt have to tell me . I know , anyway . I 've known it . all the time that he 's part nigger . " She returned to the house . She did not walk fast now and she yawned , terrifically . All I have to do is to think of some way to make the madam believe it . He wont tell her , back me up . ' She yawned again , tremendously , her face emptied now of everything save yawning and then emptied even of yawning . She had just thought of something else . She had not thought of it before , but she believed that she had , had known it all the while , because it seemed so right : he would not only be removed ; he would be punished for having given her terror and worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' she thought . Of course . They will have to . ' She did not even go to the matron at once . She had started there , but instead of turning toward the office door she saw herself passing it , going on toward the stairs and mounting . It was as though she followed herself to see where she was going . In the corridor , quiet and empty now , she yawned again , with utter relaxation . She entered her room and locked the door and took off her clothes and got into bed . The shades were drawn and she lay still in the more than halfdark , on her back . Her eyes were closed and her face was empty and smooth . After a while she began to open her legs and close them slowly , feeling the sheets flowcool and smooth over them and then flow warm and smooth again . Thinking seemed to hang suspended between the sleep which she had not had now in three nights and the sleep which she was about to receive , her body open to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need do  | is to make the madam believe , ' she thought . And then she thought He will look just like a pea in a pan full of coffee beans That was in the afternoon . At nine that evening she was undressing again when she heard the janitor come up the corridor , toward her door . She did not , could not , know who it was , then somehow she did know , hearing the steady feet and then a knock at the door which already began to open before she could spring to it . She did n't call ; she sprang to the door , putting her weight against it , holding it to . " I 'm undressing ! " she said in a thin , agonised voice , knowing who it was . He did n't answer , his weight firm and steady against the crawling door , beyond the crawling gap . " You cant come in here ! " she cried , hardly louder than a whisper . " Do nt you know they . . . " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not answer . She tried to halt and hold the slow inward crawling of the door . " Let me get some clothes on , and I 'll come out there . Will you do that ? " She spoke in that fainting whisper , her tone light , inconsequential , like that of one speaking to an unpredictable child or a maniac : soothing , cajoling : " You wait , now . Do you hear ? Will yo't wait , now ? " He did not answer . The slow and irresistible crawling of the door did not cease . Leaning against it , wearing nothing save her undergarment , she was like a puppet in some burlesque of rapine and despair . Leaning , downlooking , immobile , she appeared to be in deepest thought , as if the puppet in the midst of the scene had gone astray within itself . Then she turned , releasing the door , and sprang back to the bed , whipping up without looking at it a garment and whirling to face the door , clutching the garment at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been  | watching her and waiting during the whole blind interval of fumbling and interminable haste . He still wore the overalls and he now wore his hat . He did not remove it . Again his cold mad gray eyes did not seem to see her , to look at her at all . " If the Lord Himself come into the room of one of you , " he said , " you would believe He come in bitchery . " He said , " Have you told her ? " The woman sat on the bed . She seemed to sink slowly back upon it , clutching the garment , watching him , her face blanched . " Told her ? " " What will she do with him ? " " Do ? " She watched him : those bright , still eyes that seemed not to look at her so much as to envelop her . Her mouth hung open like the mouth of an idiot . " Where will they send him to ? " She did n't answer . " Do nt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll send him to the one for niggers . " Her mouth closed ; it was as if she had discovered at last what he was talking about . " Ay , I 've thought it out . They 'll send him to the one for nigger children . " She did n't answer , but she was watching him now , her eyes still a little fearful but secret too , calculating . Now he was looking at her ; his eyes seemed to contract upon her shape and being . " Answer me , Jezebel ! " he shouted . " Shhhhhhhhh ! " she said . " Yes . They 'll have to . When they find ... " " Ah , " he said . His gaze fades ' . ; the eyes released her and enveloped her again . Looking at them , she seemed to see herself as less than nothing in them , trivial as a twig floating upon a pool . Then his eyes became almost human . He began to look about the womanroom as if he had never  | seen one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ womanpinksmelling . " Wo nanfilth , " he said . " Before the face of God . " He turned and went out . After a while the woman rose . She stood for a time , clutching the garment , motionless , idiotic , staring at the empty door as if she could not think what to tell herself to do . Then she ran . She sprang to the door , flinging herself upon it , crashing it to and locking it , leaning against it , panting , clutching the turned key in both hands . At breakfast time the next morning the janitor and the child were missing . No trace of them could be found . The police were notified at once . A side door was found to be unlocked , to which the janitor had a key . " It 's because he knows , " the dietitian told the matron . " Knows what ? " " That that child , that Christmas boy , is a nigger . " " A what ? " the matron said . Backthrust in her chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ne ? I do nt believe it ! " she cried . " I do nt believe it ! " " You do nt have to believe it , " the other said . " But he knows it . He stole him away because of it . " The matron was past fifty , flabby faced , with weak , kind , frustrated eyes . " I do nt believe it ! " she said . But on the third day she sent for the dietitian . She looked as if she had not slept in some time . The dietitian , on the contrary , was quite fresh , quite serene . She was still unshaken when the matron told her the news , that the man and the child had been found . " At Little Rock , " the matron said . " He tried to put the child into an orphanage there . They thought he was crazy and held him until the police came . " She looked at the younger woman . " You told me ... The other day you said . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dietitian did not look away . " I did n't . I had no idea at all . Of course I knew it did n't mean anything when the other children called him Nigger ? " " Nigger ? " the matron said . " The other children ? " " They have been calling him Nigger for years . Sometimes I think that children have a way of knowing things that grown people of your and my age do nt see . Children , and old people like him , like that old man . That 's why he always sat in the door yonder while they were playing in the yard : watching that child . Maybe he found it out from hearing the other children call him Nigger . But he might have known beforehand . If you remember , they came here about the same time . He had n't been working here hardly a month before the night  --  that Christmas , do nt you remember  --  when Ch  --  they found the baby on the doorstep ? " She spoke smoothly , watching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own as though she could not remove them . The dietitian 's eyes were bland and innocent . " And so the other day we were talking and he was trying to tell me something about the child . It was something he wanted to tell me , tell somebody , and finally he lost his nerve maybe and would n't tell it , and so I left him . I was n't thinking about it at all . It had gone completely out of my mind when ? " Her voice ceased . She gazed at the matron while into her face there came an expression of enlightenment , sudden comprehension ; none could have said if it were simulated or not . " Why , that 's why it . . . Why , I see it all , now . What happened just the day before they were gone , missing . I was in the corridor , going to my room ; it was the same day I happened to be talking to him and he refused to tell me whatever it was he started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stopped me ; I  | thought then it was funny because I had never before seen him inside the house . And he said  --  he sounded crazy , he looked crazy . I was scared , too scared to move , with him blocking the corridor  --  he said , Have you told her yet ? ' and I said , Told who ? Told who what ? ' and then I realised he meant you ; if I had told you that he had tried to tell me something about the child . But I did n't know what he meant for me to tell you and I wanted to scream and then he said , What will she do if she finds it out ? ' and I did n't know what to say or how to get away from him and then he said , You do nt have to tell me . I know what she will do . She will send him to the one for niggers . ' " " For negroes ? " " I do nt see how we failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at his face now , his eyes and hair . Of course it 's terrible . But that 's where he will have to go , I suppose . " Behind her glasses the weak , troubled eyes of the matron had a harried , jellied look , as if she were trying to force them to something beyond their physical cohesiveness . " But why did he want to take the child away ? " " Well , if you want to know what I think , I think he is crazy . If you could have seen him in the corridor that ni . day like I did . Of course it 's bad for the child to have to go to the nigger home , after this , after growing up with white people . It 's not his fault what he is . But it 's not our fault , either ? " She ceased , watching the matron . Behind the glasses the older woman 's eyes were still harried , weak , hopeless ; her mouth was trembling as she shaped speech with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisive enough , determined enough . " We must place him . We must place him at once . What applications have we ? If you will hand me the file . . . "  | When the child wakened , he was being carried . It was pitc , dar - cold ; he was being carried down stairs by someone who moved with silent and infinite care . Pressed between him and one of the arms which supported him was a wad which he knew to be his clothes . He made no outcry , no sound . He knew where he was by the smell , the air , of the back stairway which led down to the side door from the room in which his bed had been one among forty others since he could remember . He knew also by smell that the person who carried him was a man . But he made no sound , lying as still and as lax as while he had been asleep , riding high in the invisible arms , moving , descending slowly toward the side door which gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying him . He did n't bother about it because he believed that he knew where he was going . Or why , that is . He did n't bother about where either , yet . It went back two years , to when he was three years old . One day there was missing from among them a girl of twelve named Alice . He had liked her , enough to let her mother him a little ; perhaps because of it . And so to him she was as mature , almost as large in size , as the adult women who ordered his eating and washing and sleeping , with the difference that she was not and never would be his enemy . One night she waked him . She was telling him goodbye but he did not know it . He was sleepy and a little annoyed , never full awake , suffering her because she had always tried to be good to him . He did n't know that she was crying because he did not know that grown people cried , and by the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went back into sleep while still suffering her , and the next morning she was gone . Vanished , no trace of  | her left , not even a garment , the very bed in which she had slept already occupied by a new boy . He never did know where she went to . That day he listened while a few of the older girls who had helped her prepare to leave in that same hushed , secret sibilance in which a half dozen young girls help prepare the seventh one for marriage told , still batebreathed , about the new dress , the new shoes , the carriage which had fetched her away . He knew then that she had gone for good , had passed beyond the iron gates in the steel fence . He seemed to see her then , grown heroic at the instant of vanishment beyond the clashedto gates , fading without diminution of size into something nameless and splendid , like a sunset . It was more than a year before he knew that she had not been the first and would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vanish beyond the clashedto gates , in a new dress or new overalls , with a small neat bundle less large sometimes than a shoebox . He believed that that was what was happening to him now . He believed that he knew now how they had all managed to depart without leaving any trace behind them . He believed that they had been carried out , as he was being , in the dead of night . Now he could feel the door . It was quite near now ; he knew to the exact number how many more invisible steps remained to which in turn the man who carried him would lower himself with that infinite and silent care . Against his cheek he could feel the man 's quiet , fast , warm breathing ; beneath him he could feel the tense and rigid arms , the wadded lump which he knew was his clothing caught up by feel in the dark . The man stopped . As he stooped the child 's feet swung down and touched the floor , his toes curling away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time . " Stand up , " he said . Then the child knew who he was . He recognised the man at once , without surprise . The surprise would have been the matron 's if she had known how well lie did know the man . He did not know the man 's name and in the three years since he had been a sentient creature they had not spoken a hundred words . But the man was a more definite person than anyone else in his life , not excepting the girl Alice . Even at three years of age the child knew that there was something between them that did not need to be spoken . He knew that he was never on the playground for an instant that the man was not watching him from the chair in the furnace room door , and that the man was watching him with a profound and unflagging attention . If the child had been older he would perhaps have thought He hates me and fears me . So much so that he can not let me out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might have thought That is why I am different from the others : because he is watching me all the time He accepted it . So he was not surprised when he found who it was who had taken him , sleeping , from his bed and carried him downstairs ; as , standing beside the door in the cold pitch dark while the man helped him put on his clothes , he might have thought He hates me enough even to try to prevent something that is about to happen to me coming to pass He dressed obediently , shivering , as swiftly as he could , the two of them fumbling at the small garments , getting them on him somehow . " Your shoes , " the man said , in that dying whisper . " Here . " The child sat on the cold floor , putting on the shoes . The man was not touching him now , but the child could hear , feel , that the man was stooped too ,  | engaged in something . He 's putting on his shoes too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , groping , lifting him to his feet . His shoes were not laced . He had not learned to do that by himself yet . He did not tell the man that he had not laced them . He made no sound at all . He just stood there and then a bigger garment-enveloped him completely ? by its smell he knew that it belonged to the man  --  and then he was lifted again . The door opened , inyawned . The s fresh cold air rushed in , and light from the lamps along the street ; he could see the lights and the blank factory walls and the tall unsmoking chimneys against the stars . Against the street light the steel fence was like a parade of starved soldiers . As they crossed the empty playground his dangling feet swung rhythmically to the man 's striding , the unlaced shoes flapping about his ankles . They reached the iron gates and passed through . They did not have to wait long for the streetcar . If he had been older he would have remarked how well the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or notice . He just stood on the corner beside the man , in the unlaced shoes , enveloped to the heels in the man 's coat , his eyes round and wide , his small face still , awake . The car came up , the row of windows , jarring to a stop and humming while they entered . It was almost empty , since the hour was past two o'clock . Now the man noticed the unlaced shoes and laced them , the child watching , quite still on the seat , his Iegs thrust straight out before him . The station was a long distance away , and he had ridden on a streetcar before , so when they reached the station he was asleep . When he waked it was daylight and they had been on the train for some time . He had never ridden on a train before , but no one could have told it . He sat quite still , as in the street-  | car , completely enveloped in the man 's coat save for his outthrust legs and his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and such  --  that he had never seen before flowing past . When the man saw that he was awake he produced food from a piece of newspaper . It was bread , with ham between . " Here , " the man said . He took the food and ate , looking out the window . He said no word , he had shown no surprise , not even when on the third day the policemen came and got him and the man . The place where they now were was no different from the one which they had left in the night  --  the same children , with different names ; the same grown people , with different smells : he could see no more reason why he should not have stayed there than why he should ever have left the first one . But he was not surprised when they came and told him again to get up and dress , neglecting to tell him why or where he was going now . Perhaps he knew that he was going back ; perhaps with his child 's clairvoyance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not : that it would not , could not , last . On the train again he saw the same hills , the same trees , the same cows , but from another side , another direction . The policeman gave him food . It was bread , with ham between , though it did not come out of a scrap of newspaper . He noticed that , but he said nothing , perhaps thought nothing . Then he was home again . Perhaps he expected to be punished upon his return , for what , what crime exactly , he did not expect to know , since he had already learned that , though children can accept adults as adults , adults can never accept children as anything but adults too . He had already forgot the toothpaste affair . He was now avoiding the dietitian just as , a month ago , he had been putting himself  | in her way . He was so busy avoiding her that he had long since forgot the reason for it ; soon he had forgotten the trip too , since he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Now and then he thought of it , hazily and vaguely . But that was only when he would look toward the door to the furnace room and remember the man who used to sit there and watch him and who was now gone , completely , without leaving any trace , not even the splint chair in the doorway , after the fashion of all who departed from there . Where he may have gone to also the child did not even think or even wonder . One evening they came to the schoolroom and got him . It was two weeks before Christmas . Two of the young women  --  the dietitian was not one  --  took him to the bathroom and washed him and combed his damp hair and dressed him in clean overalls and fetched him to the matron 's office . In the office sat a man , a stranger . And he looked at the man and he knew before the matron even Spoke . Perhaps memory knowing , knowing beginning to /remember ; perhaps even desire , since five is still too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he remembered suddenly the train ride and the food , since even memory did not go much further back than that . " Joseph , " the matron said , " how would you like to go and live with some nice people in the country ? " He stood there , his ears and face red and burning with harsh soap and harsh towelling , in the stiff new overalls , listening to the stranger . He had looked once and saw a thickish man with a close brown beard and hair cut close though not recently . Hair and beard both had a hard , vigorous quality , unsilvered , as though the pigmentation were impervious to the forty and more years which the face  | revealed . The eyes were lightcolored , cold . He wore a suit of hard , decent black . On his knee rested a black hat held in a blunt clean hand shut , even on the soft felt of the hat , into a fist . Across his vest ran a heavy silver watch chain . His thick black shoes were planted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even the child of five years , looking at him , knew that he did not use tobacco himself and would not tolerate it in others . But he did not look at the man because of his eyes . He could feel the man looking at him though , with a stare cold and intent and yet not deliberately harsh , It was the same stare with which he might have examined a horse or a second hand plow , convinced beforehand that he would see flaws , convinced beforehand that he would buy . His voice was deliberate , infrequent , ponderous ; the . voice of a man who demanded that he be listened to not so much with attention but in silence . " And you either can not or will not tell me anything more about his parentage . " The matron did not look at him . Behind her glasses her eyes apparently had jellied , for the time at least . She said immediately , almost a little too immediately : " We make no effort to ascertain their parentage . As I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here on Christmas eve ; it will be five years this two weeks .. If the child 's parentage is important to you , you had better not adopt one at all . " " I would not mean just that , " the stranger said . His tone now was a little placative . He contrived at once to apologise without surrendering one jot of his conviction . " I would have thought to talk with Miss Atkins ( this was the dietitian 's name ) since it was with her I have been in correspondence . " Again the matron 's voice was cold and immediate , speak  | ing almost before his had ceased : " I can perhaps give you as much information about this or any other of our children as Miss Atkins can , since her official connection here is only with the diningroom and kitchen . It just happened that in this case she was kind enough to act as secretary in our correspondence with you . " " It 's no matter , " the stranger said . " It 's no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just thought what ? We force no one to take our children , nor do we force the children to go against their wishes , if their reasons are sound ones . That is a matter for the two parties to settle between themselves . We only advise . " " Ay , " the stranger said . " It 's no matter , as I just said to you . I 've no doubt the tyke will do . He will find a good home with Mrs. McEachern and me . We are not young now , and we like quiet ways . And he 'll find no fancy food and no idleness Nor neither more work than will be good for him . I make no doubt that with us he will grow up to fear God and abhor idleness and vanity despite his origin . " Thus the promissory note which he had signed with a tube of toothpaste on that afternoon two months ago was recalled , the yet oblivious executor of it sitting wrapped in a clean horse blanket , small , shapeless , immobile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December twilight up a frozen and rutted lane . They had driven all that day . At noon the man had fed him , taking from beneath the seat a cardboard box containing country food cooked three days ago . But only now did the man speak to him . He spoke a single word , pointing up the lane with a mittened fist which clutched the whip , toward a single light which shown in the dusk . " Home , " he said . The child said  | nothing . The man looked down at him . The man was bundled too against the cold , squat , big , shapeless , somehow rocklike , indomitable , not so rnuch ungentle as ruthless . " I said , there is your home . " Still the child did n't answer . He had never seen a home , so there was nothing for him to say about it . And he was not old enough to talk and say nothing at the same time . " You will find food and shelter and the care of Christian people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your strength that will keep you out of mischief . For I will have you learn soon that the two abominations are sloth and idle thinking , the two virtues areworkand the fear of God . " Still the child said nothing . He had neither ever worked nor feared God . He knew less about God than about work . He had seen work going on in the person of men with rakes and shovels about the playground six days each week , but God had only occurred on Sunday . And then  --  save for the concomitant ordeal of cleanliness  --  it was music that pleased the ear and words that did not trouble the ear at all  --  on the whole , pleasant , even if a little tiresome . He said nothing at all . The buggy jolted on , the stout , wellkept team eagering , homing , barring . There was one other thing which he was not to remember until later , when memory no longer accepted his face , accepted the surface of remembering . They were in the matron 's office ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes which he could feel upon him , waiting for the stranger to say what his eyes were thinking . Then it came : " Christmas . A heathenish name . Sacrilege . I will change that . " " That will be your legal right , " the matron said . " We  | are not interested in what they are called , but in how they are treated . " But the stranger was not listening to anyone anymore than he was talking to anyone . " From now on his name will be McEachern . " " That will be suitable , " the matron said . " To give him your name . " " He will eat my bread and he will observe my religion , " the stranger said . " Why should he not bear my name ? " The child was not listening . He was not bothered . He did not especially care , anymore than if the man had said the day was hot when it was not hot . He did n't even bother to say to himself My name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no need to bother about that yet . There was plenty of time . " Why not , indeed ? " the matron said .  | 7 AND memory knows this ; twenty years later memory is still to believe On this day I became a man The clean , spartan room was redolent of Sunday . In the windows the clean , darned curtains stirred faintly in a breeze smelling of turned earth and crabapple . Upon the yellow imitation oak melodeon with its pedals padded with pieces of frayed and outworn carpet sat a fruit jar filled with larkspur . The boy sat in a straight chair beside the table on which was a nickel lamp and an enormous Bible with brass clasps and hinges and a brass lock . He wore a clean white shirt without a collar . His trousers were dark , harsh , and new . His shoes had been polished recently and clumsily , as a boy of eight would polish them , with small dull patches here and there , particularly about the heels , where the polish had failed to overlap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Presbyterian- catechism . McEachern stood beside the table . He wore a clean , glazed shirt , and the same black trousers in which the boy had first seen him . His hair , damp , still unsilvered , was combed clean and stiff upon his round skull . His beard was  | also combed , also still damp . " You have not tried to learn it , " he said . The boy did not look up . He did not move . But the face of the man was not more rocklike . " I did try . " " Then try again . I 'll give you another hour . " From his pocket McEachern took a thick silver watch and laid it faceup on the table and drew up a second straight , hard chair to the table and sat down , his clean , scrubbed hands on his knees , his heavy polished shoes set squarely . On them were no patches where the polish had failed to overlap . There had been last night at suppertime , though . And later the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received a whipping and then polished them again . The boy sat at the table . His face was bent , still , expressionless . Into the bleak , clean room the springfilled air blew in fainting gusts . That was at nine o'clock . They had been there since eight . There were churches nearby , but the Presbyterian church was five miles away ; it would take an hour to drive it . At half past nine Mrs McEachern came in . She was dressed , in black , with a bonnet  --  a small woman , entering timidly , a little hunched , with a beaten face . She looked fifteen years older than the rugged and vigorous husband . She did not quite enter the room . She just came within the door and stood there for a moment , in her bonnet and her dress of rusty yet often brushed black , carrying an umbrella and a palm leaf fan , with something queer about her eyes , as if whatever she saw or heard , she saw or heard through a more immediate manshape or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorous and ruthless husband the control . He may have heard her . But he neither looked up nor spoke . She turned and went away .  | Exactly on the dot of the hour McEachern raised his head . " Do you know it now ? " he said . The boy did not move . " No , " he said . McEachern rose , deliberately , without haste . He took up the watch and closed it and returned it to his pocket , looping the chain again through his suspender . " Come , " he said . He did not look back . The boy followed , down the hall , toward the rear ; he too walked erect and in silence , his head up . There was a very kinship of stubbornness like a transmitted resemblance in their backs . Mrs McEachern was in the kitchen . She still wore the hat , still carried the umbrella and the fan . She was watching the door when they passed it . " Pa , " she said . Neither of them so much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she might not have spoken , at all . They went on , in steady single file , the two backs in their rigid abnegation of all compromise more alike than actual blood could have made them . They crossed the back yard and went on toward the stable and entered . McEachern opened the crib door and stood aside The boy entered the crib . McEachern took from the wall a harness strap . It was neither new nor old , like his shoes . It was clean , like the shoes , and it smelled like the man smelled : an odor of clean hard virile living leather . He looked down at the boy . " Where is the book ? " he said . The boy stood before him , still , his face calm and a little pale beneath the smooth parchment skin . " You did not bring it , " McEachern said . " Go back and get it . " His voice was no unkind . It was not human , personal , at all . It was jut cold ) implacable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went out . When he reached the house Mrs McEachern was in the hall . " Joe , " she said . He did not answer . He did n't even  | look at her , at her face , at the stiff movement of one half lifted hand in stiff caricature of the softest movement which human hand can make . He walked stiffly past her , rigidfaced , his face rigid with pride perhaps and despair . Or maybe it was vanity , the stupid vanity of a man . He got the catechism from the table and returned to the stable . McEachern was waiting , holding the strap . " Put it down , " he said . The boy laid the book on the floor . " Not there , " McEachern said , without heat . " You would believe that a stable floor , the stamping place of beasts , is the proper place for the word of God . But I 'll learn you that , too . " He took up the book himself and laid it on a ledge . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll not soil them . " Then the boy stood , his trousers collapsed about his feet , his legs revealed beneath his brief shirt . He stood , slight and erect . When the strap fell he did not flinch , no quiver passed over his face . He was looking straight ahead , with a rapt , calm expression like a monk in a picture . McEachern began to strike methodically , with slow and deliberate force , still without heat or anger . It would have been hard to say which face was the more rapt , more calm , more convinced . He struck ten times , then he stopped . " Take the book , " he said . " Leave your pants be . " He handed the boy the catechism . The boy took it . He stood so , erect , his face and the pamphlet lifted , his attitude one of exaltation . Save for surplice he might have been a Catholic choir boy , with for nave the looming and shadowy crib , the rough planked wall beyond which in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with snorts and indolent thuds . McEachern lowered himself stiffly to the top of a feed box , spreadkneed , one hand on his knee and the  | silver watch in the other palm , his clean , bearded face as firm as carved stone , his eyes ruthless , cold , but not unkind . They remained so for another hour . Before it was up Mrs McEachern came to the back door of the house . But she did not speak . She just stood there , looking at the stable , in the hat , with the umbrella and the fan . Then she went back into the house . Again on the exact second of the hour McEachern returned the watch to his pocket . " Do you know it now ? " he said . The boy did n't answer , rigid , erect , holding the open pamphlet before his face . McEachern took the book from between his hands . Otherwise , the boy did not move at all . " Repeat your catechism , " McEachern said . The boy stared straight at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white despite the smooth rich pallor of his skin . Carefully and deliberately McEachern laid the book upon the ledge and took up the strap . He struck ten times . When he finished , the boy stood for a moment longer motionless . He had had no breakfast yet ; neither of them had eaten breakfast yet . Then the boy staggered and would have fallen if the man had not caught his arm , holding him up . " Come , " McEachern said , trying to lead him to the feed box . " Sit down here . " " No , " the boy said . His arm began to jerk in the man 's grasp . McEachern released him . " Are you all right ? Are you sick ? " " No , " the boy said . His voice was faint , his face was quite white . " Take the book , " McEachern said , putting it into the boy 's hand . Through the crib window Mrs McEachern came into view , emerging from the house . She now wore a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | a cedar bucket . She crossed the window without looking toward the crib , and vanished . After a time the slow creak of a well pulley reached them , coming with a peaceful , startling quality upon the Sabbath air . Then she appeared again in the window , her body balanced now to the bucket 's weight in her hand , and reentered the house without looking toward the stable . Again on the dot of the hour McEachern looked up from the watch . " Have you learned it ? " he said . The boy did not answer , did not move . When McEachern approached he saw that the boy was not looking at the page at all , that his eyes were quite fixed and quite blank . When he put his hand on the book he found that the boy was clinging to it as if it were a rope or a post . When McEachern took the book forcibly from his hands , the boy fell at full length to the floor and did not move again . When he came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed in the attic room with its lowpitched roof . The room was quiet , already filling with twilight . He felt quite well , and he lay for some time , looking peacefully up at the slanted ceiling overhead , before he became aware that there was someone sitting beside the bed . It was McEachern . He now wore his everyday clothes also  --  not the overalls in which he went to the field , but a faded clean shirt without a collar , and faded , clean khaki trousers . " You are awake , " he said . His hand came forth and turned back the cover . " Come , " he said . The boy did not move . " Are you going to whip me again ? " " Come , " McEachern said . " Get up . " The boy rose from the bed and stood , thin , in clumsy cotton underclothes . McEachern was moving also , thickly , with clumsy , muscle-  | bound movements , as if at the expenditure of tremendous effort ; the boy , watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man kneel slowly and heavily beside the bed . " Kneel down , " McEachern said . The boy knelt ; the two of them knelt in the close , twilit room : the small figure in cutdown underwear , the ruthless man who had never known either pity or doubt . McEachern began to pray . He prayed for a long time , his voice droning , soporific , meneten us . He asked that he be forgiven for trespass against the Sabbath and for lifting his hand against a child , an orphan , who was dear to God . He asked that the child 's stubborn heart be softened and that the sin of disobedience be forgiven him also , through the advocacy of the man whom he had flouted and disobeyed , requesting that Almighty be as magnanimous as himself , and by and through and because of conscious grace . He finished and rose , heaving to his feet . The boy still knelt . He did not move at all . But his eyes were open ( his face had never been hidden or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , peaceful , quite inscrutable . He heard the man fumble at the table on which the lamp sat . A match scraped , spurted ; the flame steadied upon the wick , beneath the globe upon which the man 's hand appeared now as if it had been dipped in blood . The shadows whirled and steadied . McEarchern lifted something from the table beside the lamp : the catechism . He looked down at the boy : a nose , a cheek jutting , granitelike , bearded to the caverned and spectacled eyesocket . " Take the book , " he said . It had begun that Sunday morning before breakfast . He had had no breakfast ; likely neither he nor the man had once thought of that . The man himself had eaten no  | breakfast , though he had gone to the table and demanded absolution for the food and for the necessity of eating it . At the noon meal he had been asleep , from nervous exhaustion . And at supper time neither of them had thought of food . The boy did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt weak and peaceful . That was how he felt as he lay in bed . The lamp was still burning ; it was now full dark outside . Some time had elapsed , but it seemed to him that if he turned his head he would still see the two of them , himself and the man , kneeling beside the bed , or anyway , in the rug the indentations of the twin pairs of knees without tangible substance . Even the air seemed still to excrete that monotonous voice as of someone talking in a dream , talking , adjuring , arguing with a Presence who could not even make a phantom indentation in an actual rug . He was lying so , on his back , his hands crossed on his breast like a tomb effigy , when he heard again feet on the cramped stairs . They were not the man 's ; he had heard McEachern drive away in the buggy , departing in the twilight to drive three miles and to a church which was not Presbyterian , to serve the expiation which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head the boy heard Mrs McEachern toil slowly up the stairs . He heard her approach across the floor . He did not look , though after a time her shadow came and fell upon the wall where he could see it , and he saw that she was carrying something . It was a tray of food . She set the tray on the bed . He had not once looked at her . He had not moved . " Joe , " she said . He did n't move . " Joe , " she said . She could see that his ' eyes were open . She did not touch him .  | " I ai nt hungry , " he said . She did n't move . She stood , her hands folded into her apron . She did n't seem to be looking at him , either . She seemed to be speaking to the wall beyond the bed . " I know what you think . It ai nt that . He never told me to bring it to you . It was me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It ai nt any food he sent you . " He did n't move . His face was calm as a graven face , looking up at the steep pitch of the plank ceiling . " You have n't eaten today . Sit up and eat . It was n't him that told me to bring it to you . He do nt know it . I waited until he was gone and then I fixed it myself . " He sat up then . While she watched him he rose from the bed and took the tray and carried it to the corner and turned it upside down , dumping the dishes and food and all onto the floor . Then he returned to the bed , carrying the empty tray as though it were a monstrance and he the bearer , his surplice the cutdown undergarment which had been bought for a man to wear . She was not watching him now , though she had not moved . Her hands were still rolled into her apron . He got back into bed and lay again on his back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could see her motionless shadow , shapeless , a little hunched . Then it went away . He did not look , but he could hear her kneel in the corner , gathering the broken dishes back into the tray . Then she left the room . It was quite still then . The lamp burned steadily above the steady wick ; on the wall the flitting shadows of whirling moths were as large as birds . From beyond the window he could smell , feel , darkness , spring , the earth . He was just eight then . It was years later that memory 7 knew what he was remembering ; years after that night  | when , an hour later , he rose from the bed and went and knelt in the corner as he had not knelt on the rug , and above the outraged food kneeling , with his hands ate , like a savage , like a dog . It was dusk ; already he should have been miles toward home . Although his Saturday afternoons were free , he had never before been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home he would be whipped . But not for what he might have or might not have done during his absence . When he reached home he would receive the same whipping though he had committed no sin as he would receive if McEachern had seen him commit it . But perhaps he did not yet know himself that he was not going to commit the sin . The five of them were gathered quietly in the dusk about the sagging doorway of a deserted sawmill shed where , waiting hidden a hundred yards away , they had watched the negro girl enter and look back once and then vanish . One of the older boys had arranged it and he went in first . The others , boys in identical overalls , who lived within a three mile radius , who , like the one whom they knew as Joe McEachern , could at fourteen and fifteen plow and milk and chop wood like grown men , drew straws for turns . Perhaps he did not even think of it as a sin until he thought of the man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourteen the paramount sin would be to be publicly convicted of virginity . His turn came . He entered the shed . It was dark . At once he was overcome by a terrible haste . There was something in him trying to get out , like when he had used to think of toothpaste . But he could not move at once , standing there , smelling the woman , smelling the negro all at once ;  | enclosed by the womanshenegro and the haste , driven , having to wait until She spoke : a guiding sound that was no particular word and completely unaware . Then it seemed to him that he could see her  --  something , prone , abject ; her eyes perhaps . Leaning , he seemed to look down into a black well and at the bottom saw two glints like reflection of dead stars . He was moving , because his foot touched her . Then it touched her again because he kicked her . He kicked her hard , kicking into and through a choked wail of surprise and fear . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her by the arm , hitting at her with wide , wild blows , striking at the voice perhaps , feeling her flesh anyway , enclosed by the womanshenegro and the haste . Then she fled beneath his fist , and he too fled backward as the others fell upon him , swarming , grappling , fumbling , he striking back , his breath hissing with rage and despair . Then it was male he smelled , they smelled ; somewhere beneath it the She scuttling , screaming . They trampled and swayed , striking at whatever hand or body touched , until they all went down in a mass , he underneath . Yet he still struggled , fighting , weeping . There was no She at all now . They just fought ; it was as if a wind had blown among them , hard and clean . They held him down now , holding him helpless . " Will you quit now ? We got you . Promise to quit now . " " No , " he said . He heaved , twisting . " Quit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nt nobody want to fight you , anyway . " " No , " he said , panting , struggling . None of them could see , tell who was who . They had completely forgot about the girl , why they had fought , if they had ever known . On the part of the other four it had been purely automatic  | and reflex : that spontaneous compulsion of the male to fight with or because of or over the partner with which he has recently or is about to copulate . But none of them knew why he had fought . And he could not have told them . They held him to the earth , talking to one another in quiet , strained voices . " Some of you all back there get await . Then the rest of us will turn him loose at the same time . " " Who 's got him ? Who is this I 've got ? " " Here ; turn loose . Now wait : here he is . Me and ? " Again the mass of them surged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got him here . You all turn loose and get out . Give us room . " Two of them rose and backed away , into the door . Then the other two seemed to explode upward out of the earth , the duskfilled shed , already running . Joe struck at them as soon as he was free , but they were already clear . Lying on his back he watched the four of them run on in the dusk , slowing , turning to look back . He rose and emerged from the shed . He stood in the door , brushing himself off , this too purely automatic , while a short distance away they huddled quietly and looked back at him . He did not look at them . He went on , his overalls duskcolored in the dusk . It was late now . The evening star was rich and heavy as a jasmine bloom . He did not look back once . He went on , fading , phantomlike ; the four boys who watched him huddled quietly , their faces small and pale with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud : " Yaaah ! " He did not look back . A second voice said quietly , carrying quietly , clear : " See you tomorrow at church , Joe . " He did n't answer . He went on . Now and then he brushed at his overalls , mechanically , with his hands .  | When he came in sight of home all light had departed from the west . In the pasture behind the barn there was a spring : a clump of willows in the darkness smelt and heard but not seen . When he approached the fluting of young frogs ceased like so many strings cut with simultaneous scissors . He knelt ; it was too dark to discern even his silhouetted head . He bathed his face , his swollen eye . He went on , crossing the pasture toward the kitchen light . It seemed to watch him , biding and threatful , like an eye . When he reached the lot fence he stopped , looking at the light in the kitchen window . He stood there for a while , leaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with crickets . Against the dewgray earth and the dark bands of trees fireflies drifted and faded , erratic and random . A mockingbird sang in a tree beside the house . Behind him7 in the woods beyond the spring , two whippoorwills whistled . Beyond them , as though beyond some ultimate horizon of summer , a hound howled . Then he crossed the fence and saw someone sitting quite motionless in the door to the stable in which waited the two cows which he had not yet milked . He seemed to recognise McEachern without surprise , as if the whole situation were perfectly logical and reasonable and inescapable . Perhaps he was thinking then how he and the man could always count upon one another , depend upon one another ; that it was the woman alone who was unpredictable . Perhaps he saw no incongruity at all in the fact that he was about to be punished , who had refrained from what MtEachern would consider the cardinal sin which he could commit , exactly the same as if he had committed it . McEachern did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shirt a white blur in the door 's black yawn.  | " I have milked and fed , " he said . Then he rose , deliberately . Perhaps the boy knew that he already held the strap in his hand . It rose and fell , deliberate , numbered , with deliberate , flat reports . The boy 's body might have been wood or stone ; a post or a tower upon which the sentient part of him mused like a hermit , contemplative and remote with ecstasy and selfcrucifixion . As they approached the kitchen they walked side by side . When the light from the window fell upon them the man stopped and turned , leaning , peering . " Fighting , " he said . " What was it about ? " The boy did not answer . His face was quite still , composed . After a while he answered . His voice was quiet , cold . " Nothing . " They stood there . " You mean , you cant tell or you wont tell ? " The boy did not answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at anything . " Then , if you do nt know you are a fool . And if you wont tell you have been a knave . Have you been to a woman ? " " No , " the boy said . The man looked at him . When he spoke his tone was musing . " You have never lied to me . That I know of , that is . " He looked at the boy , at the still profile . " Who were you fighting with ? " " There was more than one . " " Ah , " the man said . " You left marks on them , I trust ? " " I do nt know . I reckon so . " " Ah , " the man said . " Go and wash . Supper is ready . " When he went to bed that night his mind was made up to run away . He felt like an eagle : hard , sufficient , potent , remorseless , strong . But that passed , though he did not then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as all space 7 was still a cage . McEachern did not actually miss the heifer for two days . Then he found the new suit where it was hidden in the barn ; on examining it he knew that it had never been worn . He found the suit in the forenoon . But he said nothing about it . That evening he entered the barn where Joe was milking . Sitting on the low stool , his head bent against the cow 's flanks , the boy 's body was now by height at least the body of a man . But McEachern did not see that . If he saw anything at all , it was the child , the orphan of five years who had sat with the still and alert and unrecking passiveness of an animal on the seat of his buggy on that December evening twelve years ago . " I do nt see your heifer , " McEachern said . Joe did n't answer . He bent above the bucket , above the steady hissing of milk . McEachern stood behind and above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your heifer has not come up . " " I know it , " Joe said . " I reckon she is down at the creek . I 'll look after her , being as she belongs to me . " " Ah , " McEachern said . His voice was not raised . " The creek at night is no place for a fifty dollar cow . " " It 'll be my loss , then , " Joe said . " It was my cow . " " Was ? " McEachern said . " Did you say was my cow ? " Joe did not look up . Between his fingers the milk hissed steadily into the pail . Behind him he heard McEachern move . But Joe did not look around until the milk no longer responded . Then he turned . McEachern was sitting on a wooden block in the door . " You had better take the milk on to the house first , " he said .  | Joe stood , the pail swinging from his hand . His voice was dogged though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Take the milk on to the house , " McEachern said . " I will wait for you here . " For a moment longer Joe stood there . Then he moved . He emerged and went on to the kitchen . Mrs McEachern came in as he was setting the pail onto the table . " Supper is ready , " she said . " Has Mr McEachern come to the house yet ? " Joe was turning away , back toward the door . " He 'll be in soon , " he said . He could feel the woman watching him . She said , in a tone tentative , anxious : " You 'll have just time to wash . " " We 'll be in soon . " He returned to the barn . Mrs McEachern came to the door and looked after him . It was not yet full dark and she could see her husband standing in the barn door . She did not call . She just stood there and watched the two men meet . She could not hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creek , you say ? " McEachern said . " I said she may be . This is a good-sized pasture . " " Ah , " McEachern said . Both their voices were quiet . " Where do you think she will be ? " " I do nt know . I ai nt no cow . I do nt know where she might be . " McEachern moved . " We 'll go see , " he said . They entered the pasture in single file . The creek was a quarter of a mile distant . Against the dark band of trees where it flowed fireflies winked and faded . They reached these trees . The trunks of them were choked with marshy undergrowth , hard to penetrate even by day . " Call her , " Mc-  | Eachern said . Joe did not answer . He did not move . They faced one another . " She 's my cow , " Joe said . " You gave her to me . I raised her from a calf because you gave her to me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I gave her to you . To teach you the responsibility of possessing , owning , ownership . The responsibility of the owner to that which he owns under God 's sufferance . To teach you foresight and aggrandisement . Call her . " For a while longer they faced one another . Perhaps they were looking at one another . Then Joe turned and went on along the marsh , McEachern following . " Why do nt you call her ? " he said . Joe did not answer . He did not seem to be watching the marsh , the creek , at all . On the contrary he was watching the single light which marked the house , looking back now and then as if he were gauging his distance from it . They did not go fast , yet in time they came to the boundary fence which marked the end of the pasture . It was now full dark . When he reached the fence Joe turned and stopped . Now he looked at the other . Again they stood face to face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that heifer ? " " I sold her , " Joe said . " Ah . You sold her . And what did you get for her , might I ask ? They could not distinguish one another 's face now . They were just shapes , almost of a height , though McEachern was the thicker . Above the white blur of his shirt McEachern 's head resembled one of the marble cannonballs on Civil War monuments . " It was my cow , " Joe said . " If she was n't mine , why did you tell me she was ? Why did you give her to me ? "  | " You are quite right . She was your own . I have not yet chidden you for selling her , provided you got a good price . And even if you were beat in the trade , which with a boy of eighteen is more than like to be so , I will not chide you for that . Though you would . better have asked the advice of some one older in the ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did . What I ask is , Where have you put the money for safekeeping ? " Joe did n't answer . They faced one another . " You gave it to your fostermother to keep for you , belike ? " " Yes , " Joe said . His mouth said it , told the lie . He had not intended to answer at all . He heard his mouth say the word with a kind of shocked astonishment . Then it was too late . " I gave it to her to put away , " he said . " Ah , " McEachern said . He sighed ; it was a sound almost luxurious , of satisfaction and victory . " And you will doubtless say also that it was your fostermother who bought the new suit which I found hid in the loft . You have revealed every other sin of which you are capable : sloth , and ingratitude , and irreverence and blasphemy . And now I have taken you in the remaining two : lying and lechery . What else would you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And then he acknowledged that the child whom he had adopted twelve years ago was a man . Facing him , the two of them almost toe to toe , he struck at Joe with his fist . Joe took the first two blows ; perhaps from habit , perhaps from surprise . But he took them , feeling twice the man 's hard fist crash into his face . Then he sprang back , crouched , licking blood , panting . They faced one another . " Do nt you hit me again , " he said . Later , lying cold and rigid in his bed in the attic , he  | heard their voices coming up the cramped stairs from the room beneath . " I bought it for him ! " Mrs McEachern said . " I did ! I bought it with my butter money . You said that I could have  --  could spend ? Simon ! Simon ! " " You are a clumsier liar than even he , " the man said . His voice came , measured , harsh , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bed . He was not listening to it . " Kneel down . Kneel down . KNEEL-DOWN , WOMAN . Ask grace and pardon of God ; not of me . " She had always tried to be kind to him , from that first December evening twelve years ago . She was waiting on the porch  --  a patient , beaten creature without sex demarcation at all save the neat screw of graying hair and the skirt ? when the buggy drove up . It was as though instead of having been subtly slain and corrupted by the ruthless and bigoted man into something beyond his intending and her knowing , she had been hammered stubbornly thinner and thinner like some passive and dully malleable metal , into an attenuation of dumb hopes and frustrated desires now faint and pale as dead ashes . When the buggy stopped she came forward as though she had already planned it , practiced it : how she would lift him down from the seat and carry him into the house . He had never been carried by a woman since he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house on his own feet , marched in , small , shapeless in his wrappings . She followed , hovering about him . She made him sit down ; it was as though she hovered about with a kind of strained alertness , an air baffled and alert , waiting to spring it again and try to make himself and her act as she  | had planned for them to act . Kneeling before him she was trying to take off his shoes , until he realised what she wanted . He put her hands away and removed the shoes himself , not setting them onto the floor though . He held to them . She stripped off his stockings and then she fetched a basin of hot water , fetched it so immediately that anyone but a child would have known that she must have had it ready and waiting all day probably . He spoke for the first time , then . " I done washed just yesterday , " he said . She did n't answer . She knelt before him while he watched the crown of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet . He did n't try to help her now . He did n't know what she was trying to do , not even when he was sitting with his cold feet in the warm water . He did n't know that that was all , because it felt too good . He was waiting for the rest of it to begin ; the part that would not be pleasant , whatever it would be . This had never happened to him before either . Later she put him to bed . For two years almost he had been dressing and undressing himself , unnoticed and unassisted save by occasional Alices . He was already too tired to go to sleep at once , and now he was puzzled and hence nervous , waiting until she went out so he could sleep . Then she did not go out . Instead she drew a chair up to the bed and sat down . There was no fire in the room ; it was cold . She had a shawl now about her shoulders , huddled into the shawl , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became wide awake now . He was waiting for the part to begin which he would not like , whatever it was , whatever it was that he had done . He did n't know that this was all . This had never happened to him before either . It began on that night . He believed that it was to go on  | for the rest of his life . At seventeen , looking back he could see now-the-long series of trivial , clumsy , vain efforts born of-frustration-end fumbling and dumb instinct : the dishes she would prepare for him in secret and then insist on his accepting and eating them in secret , when he did not want them and he knew that McEachern would not care anyway ; the times when , like tonight , she would try to get herself between him and the punishment which , deserved or not , just or unjust , was impersonal , both the man and the boy accepting it as a natural and inescapable fact until she , getting in the way , must give it an odor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would tell her alone , have her who in her helplessness could neither alter it nor ignore it , know it and need to hide it from the man whose immediate and predictable reaction to the knowledge w : uld so obliterate it as a factor in their relations that it would never appear again . To say to her in secret , in secret payment for the secret dishes which he had not wanted : " Listen . He says he has nursed a blasphemer and an ingrate . I dare you to tell him what he has nursed . That he has nursed a nigger beneath his own roof , with his own food at his own table . " Because she had always been kind to him . The man , the hard , just , ruthless man , merely depended on him to act in a certain way and to receive the as certain reward or punishment , just as he could depend on the man to react in a certain way to his own certain doings and misdoings . It , . was the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for secrecy , for casting a faint taint of evil about the most trivial and innocent actions . Behind a loose board in the wall of his attic room she had hidden a small hoard of  | money in a tin can . The amount was trivial and it was apparently a secret to no one but her husband , and the boy believed that he would not have cared . But it had never been a secret from him . Even while he was still a child she would take him with her when with all the intense and mysterious caution of a playing child she would creep to the attic and add to the hoard meagre and infrequent and terrific nickels and dimes ( fruit of what small chicanery and deceptions with none anywhere under the sun to say her nay he did not know ) , putting into the can beneath his round grave eyes coins , whose value he did not even recognise . It was she who trusted him , who insisted on trusting him as she insisted on his eating : by conspiracy , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the act of trusting was supposed to exemplify . It was not the hard work which he hated , nor the punishment and injustice . He was used to that before he ever saw either of them . He expected no less , and so he was neither outraged nor surprised . It was the woman : that soft kindness which he believed himself doomed to be forever victim of and which he hated worse than he did the hard and ruthless justice of men . She is trying to make me cry , ' he thought , lying cold and rigid in his bed , his hands beneath his head and the moonlight falling across his body , hearing the steady murmur of the man 's voice as it mounted the stairway on its first heavenward stage ; She was trying to make me cry . Then she thinks that they would have had me. '  | 8 OVING quietly , he took the rope from its hiding place . One end of it was already prepared for making fast inside the window . Now it took him no time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , with more than a year of practice , he could mount the rope hand over hand , without once touching the wall of the house , with the shadowlike agility of a cat . Leaning from the window he let the free end whisper down . In the moonlight it looked not less frail than a spider skein . Then , with his shoes tied together and strung through his belt behind him , he slid down the rope , passing swift as a shadow across the window where the old people slept . The rope hung directly before the window . He drew it tautly aside , flat against the house , and tied it . Then he went on through the moonlight to the stable and mounted to the loft and took the new suit from its hiding place . It was wrapped in paper , carefully . Before unwrapping it he felt with his hands about the folds of the paper . He found it , ' he thought . He knows . ' He said aloud , whispering : " The bastard . The son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark , swiftly . He was already late , because he had had to give them time to get to sleep after all the uproar about the heifer , the uproar which the woman had caused by meddling after it was all over , settled for the night , anyway . The bundle included a white shirt and a tie . He put the tie into his pocket , but he put on the coat so that the white shirt would not be so visible in the moonlight . He descended and emerged from the stable . The new cloth , after his soft , oftenwashed overalls , felt rich and harsh . The house squatted in the moonlight , dark , profound , a little treacherous . It was as though in the moonlight the house had acquired personality : threatful , deceptive . He passed it and entered the lane . He took from his pocket a dollar watch . He had bought it three days ago , with some of the money . But he had never owned a watch before and so he had forgot to wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell him that he was already late . The lane went straight beneath the moon , bordered on each side by trees whose shadowed branches lay thick and sharp as black paint upon the mild dust . He walked fast , the house now behind him , himself now not visible from the house . The highroad passed the lane a short distance ahead . He expected at any moment to see the car rush past , since he had told her that if he were not waiting at the mouth of the lane , he would meet her at the schoolhouse where the dance was being held . But no car passed , and when he reached the highroad he could hear nothing . The road , the night , were empty . Maybe she has already passed , ' he thought . He took out the dead watch again and looked at it . The watch was dead because he had had no chance to wind it . He had been made late by them who had given him no opportunity to wind the watch and so know  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lane , in the now invisible house , the woman now lay asleep , since she had done all she could to make him late . He looked that way , up the lane ; he stopped in the act of looking and thinking ; mind and body as if on the same switch , believing that he had seen movement among the shadows in the lane . Then he thought that he had not , that it might perhaps have been something in his mind projected like a shadow on a wall . But I hope it is him , ' he thought . I wish it was him . I wish he would follow me and see me get into the car . I wish he would try to follow us . I wish he would try to stop me . ' But he could see nothing in the lane . It was empty , intermittent with treacherous shadows . Then he heard , from far down the road toward town , the sound of the car . Looking , he saw presently the glare of the lights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back street restaurant in town . Even a casual adult glance could tell that she would never see thirty again . But to Joe she probably did not look more than seventeen too , because of her smallness . She was not only not tall , she was slight , almost childlike . But the adult look saw that the smallness was not due to any natural slenderness but to seme .. nner corruption of the spirit itself : a slenderness which had never been young , in not one of whose curves anything youthful had ever lived or lingered . Her hair was dark . Her face was prominently boned , always downlooking , as if her head were set so on her neck , a little out of line . Her eyes were like the button eyes of a toy animal : a quality beyond even hardness , without being hard . It was because of her smallness that he ever attempted her , as if her smallness should have or might have pro-  | tected her from the roving and predatory eyes of most men , leaving his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would not have dared . He would have thought , It wont be any use . She will already have a fellow , a man . ' It began in the fall when he was seventeen . It was a day in the middle of the week . Usually when they came to town it would be Saturday and they would bring food with them  --  cold dinner in a basket purchased and kept for that purpose  --  with the intention of spending the day . This time McEachern came to see a lawyer , with the intention of finishing his business and being home again by dinnertime . But it was almost twelve o'clock when he emerged onto the street where Joe waited for him . He came into sight looking at his watch . Then he looked at a municipal clock in the courthouse tower and then at the sun , with an expression of exasperation and outrage . He looked at Joe also with that expression , the open watch in his hand , his eyes cold , fretted . He seemed to be examining and weighing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from childhood . Then he turned . " Come , " he said . " It cant be helped now . " The town was a railroad division point . Even in midweek there were many men about the streets . The whole air of the place was masculine , transient : a population even whose husbands were at home only at intervals and on holiday  --  a population of men who led esoteric lives whose actual scenes were removed and whose intermittent presence was pandered to like that of patrons in a theatre . Joe had never before seen the place to which McEachern took him . It was a restaurant on a back street  --  a narrow dingy doorway between two dingy windows . He did not know that it was a restaurant at first . There was no sign  | outside and he could neither smell nor hear food cooking . What he saw was a long wooden counter lined with backless stools , and a big , blonde woman behind a cigar case near the front and a clump of men at the far end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked at him and McEachern when they entered , through the smoke of cigarettes . Nobody said anything at all . They just looked at McEachern and Joe as if breathing had stopped with talking , as if even the cigarette smoke had stopped and now drifted aimlessly of its own weight . The men were not in overalls and they all wore hats , and their faces were all alike : not young and not old ; not farmers and not townsmen either . They looked like people who had just got off a train and who would be gone tomorrow and who did not have any address . Sitting on two of the backless stools at the counter , McEachern and Joe ate . Joe ate fast because McEachern was eating fast . Beside him the man , even in the act of eating , seemed to sit in a kind of stiffbacked outrage . The food which McEachern ordered was simple : quickly prepared and quickly eaten . But Joe knew that parsimony had no part in this . Parsimony might have brought them here in preference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a desire to depart quickly that had chosen the food . As soon as he laid down his knife and fork , McEachern said , " Come , " already getting down from his stool . At the cigar counter McEachern paid the brasshaired woman . There was about her a quality impervious to time : a belligerent and diamondsurfaced respectability . She had not so much as looked at them , even when they entered and even when McEachern gave her money . Still without looking at them she made the change , correctly and swiftly , sliding the coins  | onto the glass counter almost before McEachern had offered the bill ; herself somehow definite behind the false glitter of the careful hair , the careful face , like a carved lioness guarding a portal , presenting respectability like a shield behind which the clotted and idle and equivocal men could slant their hats and their thwartfacecurled cigarettes . McEachern counted his change and they went out , into the street . He was looking at Joe again . He said : " I 'll have you remember that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man may go but a boy , a youth of your age , may not . That is one of them . Maybe you should never have gone there . But you must see such so you will know what to avoid and shun . Perhaps it was as well that you saw it with me present to explain and warn you . And the dinner there is cheap . " " What is the matter with it ? " Joe said . " That is the business of the town and not of yours . You will only mark my words : I 'll not-have you go there again unless I am with you . Which will not be again . We 'll bring nwiiner next time , early or no early . " That was what he saw that day while he was eating swiftly beside the unbending and quietly outraged man , the two of them completely isolated at the center of the long counter with at one end of it the brasshaired woman and at the other the group of men , and the waitress with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hands setting the plates and cups , her head rising from beyond the counter at about the height of a tall child . Then he and McEachern departed . He did not expect ever to return . It was not that McEachern had forbidden him . He just did not believe that his life would ever again chance there . It was as if he said to himself , They are not my people . I  | can see them but I do nt know what they are doing nor why . I can hear them but I do nt know what they are saying nor why nor to whom . I know that there is something about it beside food , eating . But I do nt know what . And I never will know . ' So it passed from the surface of thinking . Now and then during the next six months he returned to town , but he did not again even see or pass the restaurant . He could have . But he did n't think to . Perhaps he did not need to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowed into a picture , shaping , shaped : the long , barren , somehow equivocal counter with the still , coldfaced , violenthaired woman at one end as though guarding it , and at the other men with inwardleaning heads , smoking steadily , lighting and throwing away their constant cigarettes , and the waitress , the woman not much larger than a child going back and forth to the kitchen with her arms overladen with dishes , having to pass on each journey within touching distance of the men who leaned with their slanted hats and spoke to her through the cigarette smoke , murmured to her somewhere near mirth or exultation , and her face musing , demure , downcast , as if she had not heard . I do nt even know what they are saying to her , ' he thought , thinking I do nt even know that what they are saying to her is something that men do not say to a passing child believing I do not know yet that in the instant of sleep the eyelid closing prisons within the eye 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and young ; waiting , colored with all the vague and formless magic of young desire . That already there is something for love to feed upon : that sleeping I know now why I struck refraining that negro  | girl three years ago and that she must know it too and be proud too , with waiting and pride So he did not expect to see her again , since love in the young requires as little of hope as of desire to feed upon . Very likely he was as much surprised by his action and what it inferred and revealed as McEachern would have been . It was on Saturday this time , in the spring now . He had turned eighteen . Again McEachern had to see the lawyer . But he was prepared now . " I 'll be there an hour , " he said . " You can walk about and see the town . " Again he looked at Joe , hard , calculating , again a little fretted , like a just man forced to compromise between justice and judgment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purse and took a coin from it . It was a dime . " You might try not to throw it away as soon as you can find someone who will take it . It 's a strange thing , " he said fretfully , looking at Joe , " but it seems impossible for a man to learn the value of money without first having to learn to waste it . You will be here in one hour . " He took that coin and went straight to the restaurant . He did not even put the coin into his pocket . He did it without plan or design , almost without volition , as if his feet ordered his action and not his head . He carried the dime clutched hot and small in his palm as a child might . He entered the screen door , clumsily , stumbling a little . The blonde woman behind the cigar case ( it was as if she had not moved in the six months , not altered one strand of her hard bright brassridged hair or even her dress ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group of men with their tilted hats and their cigarettes and their odor of barbershops , watched him . The proprietor was among them . He noticed , saw , the proprietor for the first time . Like the other  | men , the proprietor wore a hat and was smoking . He was not a big man , not much bigger than Joe himself , with a cigarette burning in one corner of his mouth as though to be out of the way of talking . From that face squinted and still behind the curling smoke from the cigarette which was not touched once with hand until it burned down and was spat out and ground beneath a heel , Joe was to acquire one of his own mannerisms . But not yet . That was to come later , when life had begun to go so fast that accepting would taJ e the place of. no. irk and believing . Now he just ' looked at the man who leaned upon the counter from the inward side , in a dirty apron which he wore as a footpad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepting was to come later , along with the whole sum of entire outrage to credulity : these two people as husband and wife , the establishment as a business for eating , with the successive imported waitresses clumsy with the cheap dishes of simple food as business justified ; and himself accepting , taking , during his brief and violent holiday like a young stallion in a state of unbelieving and ecstatic astonishment in a hidden pasture of tired and professional mares , himself in turn victim of nameless and unnumbered men . But that was not yet . He went to the counter , clutching the dime . He believed that the men had all stopped talking to watch him , because he could hear nothing now save a vicious frying sound from beyond the kitchen door , thinking She 's back there . That 's why I do nt see her He slid onto a stool . He believed that they were all watching him . He believed that the blonde woman behind the cigar case was looking at him , and the proprietor too , across whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite still in its lazy vaporing . Then the proprietor spoke  | a single word . Joe knew that he had not moved nor touched the cigarette . " Bobbie , " he said . A man 's name . It was not thinking . It was too fast , too complete : She 's gone . They have got a man in her place . I have wasted the dime , like he said He believed that he could not leave now ; that if he tried to go out , the blonde woman would stop him . He believed that the men at the back knew this and were laughing at him . So he sat quite still on the stool , looking down , the dime clutched in his palm . He did not see the waitress until the two overlarge hands appeared upon the counter opposite him and into sight . He could see the figured pattern of her dress and the bib of an apron and the two bigknuckled hands lying on the edge of the counter as completely immobile as if they were something she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pie , " he said . Her voice sounded downcast , quit empty " Lemon cocoanut chocolate . " In proportion to the height from which her voice came , the hands could not be her hands at all . " Yes , " Joe said . The hands did not move . The voice did not move . " Lemon cocoanut chocolate . Which kind . " To the others they must have looked quite strange . Facing one another across the dark , stained , greasecrusted and frictionsmooth counter , they must have looked a little like they were praying : the youth countryfaced , in clean and Spartan clothing , with an awkwardness which invested him with a quality unworldly and innocent ; and the woman opposite him , downcast , still , waiting , who because of her smallness partook likewise of that quality of his , of something beyond flesh . Her face was highboned , gaunt . The flesh was taut across her cheekbones , circled darkly about the eyes ;  | beneath the lowered lids her eyes seemed to be without depth , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed too narrow to contain two rows of teeth . " Cocoanut , " Joe said . His mouth said it , because immediately he wanted to unsay it . He had only the dime . He had been holding it too hard to have realised yet that it was only a dime . His hand sweated about it , upon it . He believed that the men were watching him and laughing again . He could not hear them and he did not look at them . But he believed that they were . The hands had gone away . Then they returned , setting a plate and a cup before him . He looked at her now , at her face . " How much is pie ? " he said . " Pie is ten cents . " She was just standing there before him , beyond the counter , with her big hands again lying on the dark wood , with that quality spent and waiting . She had never looked at him . He said , in a faint , desperate voice : " I reckon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while she did not move . Then one of the big hands moved and took up the coffee cup ; hand and cup vanished . He sat still , downlooking too , waiting . Then it came . It was not the proprietor . It was the woman behind the cigar case . " What 's that ? " she said . " He do nt want the coffee , " the waitress said . Her voice , speaking , moved on , as if she had not paused at the question . Her voice was flat , quiet . The other woman 's voice was quiet too . " Did n't he order coffee too ? " she said . " No , " the waitress said , in that level voice that was still in motion , going away . " I misunderstood . " When he got out , when his spirit wrung with abasement and regret and passionate for hiding scuttled past the cold  | face of the woman behind the cigar case , he believed that he knew he would and could never see her again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see her again , even look at the street , the dingy doorway , even from a distance , again ,  --  not thinking yet It 's terrible to be young . It 's terrible . Terr-ible When Saturdays came he found , invented , reasons to decline to go to town , with McEachern watching him , though not with actual suspicion yet . He passed the days by working hard , too hard ; McEachern contemplated the work with suspicion . But there was nothing which the man could know , deduce . Working was permitted him . Then he could get the nights passed , since he would be too tired to lie awake . And in time even the despair and the regret and the shame grew less . He did not cease to remember it , to react it . But now it had become wornout , like a gramophone record : familiar only because of the worn threading which blurred the voices . After a while even McEachern accepted a fact . He said : " I have been watching you lately . And now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own eyes or else believe that at last you are beginning to accept what the Lord has seen fit to allot you . But I will not have you grow vain because I have spoken well of it . You 'll have time and opportunity ( and inclination too , I do nt doubt ) to make me regret that I have spoken . To fall into sloth and idleness again . However , reward was created for man the same as chastisement . Do you see that heifer yonder ? From today that calf is your own . See that I do not later regret it . " Joe thanked him . Then he could look at the calf and say , aloud : " That belongs to me . " Then he looked at it , and it was again too fast and too complete to be hg : That is not a gift . It is not even a promise : it is a threat think-  | ing , I did n't ask for it . He gave it to me . I did n't ask for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earned it It was a month later . It was Saturday morning . " I thought you did not like town anymore , " McEachern said . " I reckon one more trip wont hurt me , " Joe said . He had a half dollar in his pocket . Mrs McEachern had given it to him . He had asked for a nickel . She insisted that he take the half dollar . He took it , holding it on his palm , cold , contemptuously . " I suppose not , " McEachern said . " You have worked hard , too . But town is no good habit for a man who has yet to make his way . " He did not need to escape , though he would have , even by violence perhaps . But McEachern made it easy . He went to the restaurant , fast . He entered without stumbling now . The waitress was not there . Perhaps he saw , noticed that she was n't . He stopped at the cigar counter , behind which the woman sat , laying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nickel . For a cup of coffee . I said pie and coffee , before I knew that pie was a dime . I owe you a nickel . " He did not look toward the rear . The men were there , in their slanted hats and with their cigarettes . The proprietor was there ; waiting , Joe heard him at last , in the dirty apron , speaking past the cigarette : " What is it ? What does he want ? " " He says he owes Bobbie a nickel , " the woman said . " He wants to give Bobbie a nickel . " Her voice was quiet . The proprietor 's voice was quiet . " Well for Christ 's sake , " he said . To Joe the room was full of listening . He heard , not hearing ; he saw , not looking . He was now moving toward the door . The half dollar lay on the glass counter . Even from the rear of the room  | the proprietor could see it , since he said , " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a cup of coffee , " the woman said . Joe had almost reached the door . " Here , jack , " the man said . Joe did not stop . " Give him his money , " the man said , flat-voiced , not yet moving . The cigarette smoke would curl still across his face , unwinded by any , movement . " Give it back to him , " the man said . " I do nt know what his racket is . But he cant work it here . Give it back to him . You better go back to the farm , Hiram . Maybe you can make a girl there with a nickel . " Now he was in the street , sweating the half dollar , the coin sweating his hand , larger than a cartwheel , feeling . He walked in laughter . He had passed through the door upon it , upon the laughing of the men . It swept and carried him along the street ; then it began to flow past him , dying away , letting him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facing one another . She did not see him at once , walking swiftly , downlooking , in a dark dress and a hat . Again , stopped , she did not even look at him , having already looked at him , allseeing , like when she had set the coffee and the pie on the counter . She said , " Oh . And II li you come back to give it to me . Before them . And they kidded you . Well , say . " " I thought you might have had to pay for it , yourself . I thought ? " " Well , say . Can you tie that . Can you , now . " II They were not looking at one another , standing face to face . To another they must have looked like two monks met during the hour of contemplation in a garden path . " I just thought that I ... " " Where do you live ? " she said . " In the country ? Well , say . What 's your name ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's Christmas . " " Christmas ? Is that your name ? Christmas ? Well , say . " On the Saturday afternoons during and after adolescence he and the other four or five boys hunted and fished . He saw girls only at church , on Sunday . They were associated with Sunday and with church . So he could not notice them . To do so would be , even to him , a retraction of his religious ) hatred . But he and the other boys talked about girls . Perhaps some of them  --  the one who arranged with the negro girl that afternoon , for instance  --  knew . " They all want to , " he told the others . " But sometimes they cant . " The others did not know that . They did not know that all girls wanted to , let alone that there were times when they could not . They thought differently . But to admit that they did not know the latter would be to admit that they had not discovered the former . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's something that happens to them once a month . " He described his idea of the physical ceremony . Perhaps he knew . Anyway he was graphic enough , convincing enough . If he had tried to describe it as a mental state , something which he only believed , they would not have listened . But he drew a picture , physical , actual , to be discerned by the sense of smell and even of sight . It moved them : the temporary and abject helplessness of that which tantalised and frustrated desire ; the smooth and superior shape in which volition dwelled doomed to be at stated and inescapable intervals victims of periodical filth . That was how the boy told it , with the other five listening quietly , looking at one another , questioning and secret . On the next Saturday Joe did not go hunting with them . McEachern thought that he had already gone , since the gun was miss-  | ing . But Joe was hidden in the barn . He stayed there all that day . On the Saturday following he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys called for him . But he did not hunt . He was not three miles from home when in the late afternoon he shot a sheep . He found the flock in a hidden valley and stalked and killed one with the gun . Then he knelt , his hands in the yet warm blood of the dying beast , trembling , drymouthed , backglaring . Then he got over it , recovered . He did not forget what the boy had told him . He just accepted it . He found that he could live with it , side by side with it . It was as if he said , illogical and desperately calm All right . It is so , then . But not to me . Not in my ' life and my love Then it was three or four years ago and he had forgotten it , in the sense that a fact is forgotten when it once succumbs to the mind 's insistence that it be neither true nor false . He met the waitress on the Monday night following the Saturday on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did not have the rope then . He climbed from his window and dropped the ten feet to the earth and walked the five miles into town . He did not think at all about how he would get back into his room . He reached town and went to the corner where she had told him to wait . It was a quiet corner and he was quite early , thinking I will have to remember . To let her show me what to do and how to do it and when . To not let her find out that I do nt know , that I will have to find out from her He had been waiting for over an hour when she appeared . He had been that early . She came up on foot . She came and stood before him , small , with that air steadfast ,  | waiting , downlooking , coming up out of the darkness . " Here you are , " she said . " I got here soon as I could . I had to wait for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be late . " " Have you been here long ? How long ? " " I do nt know . I ran , most of the way . I was afraid I would be late . " " You ran ? All them three miles- ? " " It 's five miles . It 's not three . " " Well , say . " Then they did not talk . They stood there , two shadows facing one another . More than a year later , remembering that night , he said , suddenly knowing It was like she was waiting for me to hit her " Well , " she said . He had begun now to tremble a little . He could smelt her , smell the waiting : still , wise , a little weary ; thinking She 's waiting for me to start and I do nt know how Even to himself his voice sounded idiotic . " I reckon it 's late . " " Late ? " " I thought maybe they would be waiting for you . Waiting up until you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . . . " Her voice died , ceased . She said , not moving ; they stood like two shadows : " I live with Mame and Max . You know . The restaurant . You ought to remember them , trying to pay that nickel ... " She began to laugh . There was no mirth in it , nothing in it . " When I think of that . When I think of you coming in there , with that nickel . " Then she stopped laughing . There was no cessation of mirth in that , either . The still , abject , downlooking voice reached him . " I made a mistake tonight . I forgot something . " Perhaps she was waiting for him to ask her what it was . But he did not . He just stood there ,  | with a still , downspeaking voice dying somewhere about his ears . He had forgot about the shot sheep . He had lived with the fact which the older boy had told him too long now . With the slain sheep he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to be alive . So he could not understand at first what she was trying to tell him . They stood at the corner . It was at the edge of town , where the street became a road that ran on beyond the ordered and measured lawns , between small , random houses and barren fields  --  the small , cheap houses which compose the purlieus of such towns . She said , " Listen . I 'm sick tonight . " He did not understand . He said nothing . Perhaps he did not need to understand . Perhaps he had already expected some fateful mischance , thinking , It was too good to be true , anyway ' ; thinking too fast for even thought : In a moment she will vanish . She will not be . And then I will be back home , in bed , not having left it at all Her voice went on : " I forgot about the day of the month when I told you Monday night . You surprised me , I guess . There on the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Until after you had gone . " His voice was as quiet as hers . " How sick ? Have n't you got some medicine at home that you can take ? " " Have n't I got . . . " Her voice died . She said , " Well , say . " She said suddenly : " It 's late . And you with four miles to walk . " " I 've already walked it now . I 'm here now . " His voice was quiet , hopeless , calm . " I reckon it 's getting late , " he said . Then something changed . Not looking at him , she sensed something before she heard it in his hard voice : " What kind of sickness have you got ? " She did n't answer at once . Then she said , still , down  | looking : " You have n't ever had a sweetheart , yet . I 'll bet you have n't . " He did n't answer . " Have you ? " He did n't answer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She came and took his arm , lightly , in both hands . Looking down , he could see the dark shape of the lowered head which appeared to have been set out of line a little on the neck when she was born . She told him , halting , clumsily , using the only words which she knew perhaps . But he had heard it before . He had already fled backward , past the slain sheep , the price paid for immunity , to the afternoon when , sitting on a creek bank , he had been not hurt or astonished so much as outraged . The arm which she held jerked free . She did not believe that he had intended to strike her ; she believed otherwise , in fact . But the result was the same . As he faded on down the road , the shape , the shadow , she believed that he was running . She could hear his feet for some time after she could no longer see him . She did not move at once . She stood as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though waiting for the blow which she had already received . He was not running . But he was walking fast , and in a direction that was taking him further yet from home , from the house five miles away which he had left by climbing from a window and which he had not yet planned any way of reentering . He went on down the road fast and turned from it and sprang over a fence , into plowed earth . Something was growing in the furrows . Beyond were woods , trees . He reached the woods and entered , among the hard trunks , the branchshadowed quiet , hardfeeling , hardsmelling , invisible . In the notseeing and the hardknowing as though in a cave he seemed to see a diminishing row of suavely shaped urns in moonlight , blanched . And not one  | was perfect . Each one was cracked and from each crack there issued something liquid , deathcolored , and foul . He touched a tree , leaning his propped arms against it , seeing the ranked and moonlit urns . He vomited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was waiting at the same corner ; he was quite early again . Then he saw her . She came up to where he stood . " I thought maybe you would n't be here , " she said . " Did you ? " He took her arm , drawing her on down the road . " Where are we going ? " she said . He did n't answer , drawing her on . She had to trot to keep up . She trotted clumsily : an animal impeded by that which distinguished her from animals : her heels , her clothes , her smallness . He drew her from the road , toward the fence which he had crossed a week ago . " Wait , " she said , the words jolting from her mouth . " The fence  --  I cant ? " As she stooped to go through , between the strands of wire which he had stepped over , her dress caught . He leaned and jerked it free with a ripping sound . " I 'll buy you another one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself be half carried and half dragged among the growing plants , the furrows , and into the woods , the trees . He kept the rope , neatly coiled , behind the same loose board in his attic room where Mrs McEachern kept her hoard of nickels and dimes , with the difference that the rope was thrust further back into the hole than Mrs McEachern could reach . He had got the idea from her . Sometimes , with the old couple snoring in the room beneath , when he lifted out the silent rope he would think of the  | paradox . Sometimes he thought about telling her ; of showing her where he kept hidden the implement of his sin , having got the idea , learned how and where to hide it , from her . But he knew that she would merely want to help him conceal it ; that she would want him to sin in order that she could help him hide it ; that she would at last make such a todo of meaningful whispers and signals that McEachern would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to take money from the hoard . It is very possible that the woman did not suggest it to him , never mentioned money to him . It is possible that he did not even know that he was paying with money for pleasure . It was that he had watched for years Mrs McEachern hide money in a certain place . Then he himself had something which it was necessary to hide . He put it in the safest place which he knew . Each time he hid or retrieved the rope , he saw the tin can containing money . The first time he took fifty cents . He debated for some time between fifty cents and a quarter . Then he took the fifty cents because that was the exact sum he needed . With it he bought a stale and flyspecked box of candy from a man who had won it for ten cents on a punching board in a store . He gave it to the waitress . It was the first thing which he had ever given her . He gave it to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything before . Her expression was a little strange when she took the tawdry , shabby box into her big hands . She was sitting at the time on her bed in her bedroom in the small house where she lived with the man and woman called Max and Mame . One night about a week before the man came into the room . She was undressing , sitting on the bed while she removed  | her stockings . He came in and leaned against the bureau , smoking . " A rich farmer , " he said . " John Jacob Astor from the cowshed . " She had covered herself , sitting on the bed , still , downlooking . " He pays me . " " With what ? Has n't he used up that nickel yet ? " He looked at her . " A setup for hayseeds . That 's what I brought you down here from Memphis for . Maybe I 'd better start giving away grub too . " " I 'm not doing it on your time . " " Sure . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A kid , that never saw a whole dollar at one time in his life . With this town full of guys making good jack , that would treat you right . " " Maybe I like him . Maybe you had n't thought of that . " He looked at her , at the still and lowered crown of her head as she sat on the bed , her hands on her lap . He leaned against the bureau , smoking . He said , " Marne ! " After a while he said again , " Marne ! Come in here . " The walls were thin . After a while the big blonde woman came up the hall , without haste . They could both hear her . She entered . " Get this , " the man said . " She says maybe she likes him best . It 's Romeo and Juliet . For sweet Jesus ! " The blonde woman looked at the dark crown of the waitress ' head . " What about that ? " " Nothing . It 's fine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companion . " " Go out , " the woman said . " Sure . I just brought her change for a nickel . " He went out . The waitress had not moved . The blonde woman went  | to the bureau and leaned against it , looking at the other 's lowered head . " Does he ever pay you ? " she said . The waitress did not move . " Yes . He pays me . " The blonde woman looked at her , leaning against the bureau as Max had done . " Coming all the way down here from Memphis . Bringing it all the way down here to give it away . " The waitress did not move . " I 'm not hurting Max . " The blonde woman looked at the other 's lowered head . Then she turned and went toward the door . " See that you do nt , " she said . " This wont last forever . These little towns wont stand for this long . I know . I came from one of them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candy box in her hands , she sat as she had sat while the blonde woman talked to her . But it was now Joe who leaned against the bureau and looked at her . She began to laugh . She laughed , holding the gaudy box in her bigknuckled hands . Joe watched her . He watched her rise and pass him , her face lowered . She passed through the door and called Max by name . Joe had never seen Max save in the restaurant , in the hat and the dirty apron . When Max entered he was not even smoking . He thrust out his hand . " How are you , Romeo ? " he said . Joe was shaking hands almost before he had recognised the man . " My name 's Joe McEachern , " he said . The blonde woman had also entered . It was also the first time he had even seen her save in the restaurant . He saw her enter , watching her , watching the waitress open the box . She extended it . " Joe brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they met outside , went somewhere else or just loitered on the way to where she lived . Perhaps he believed up to the last that he had suggested it . Then one night she did not meet him where he waited . He waited until the clock in the courthouse struck twelve . Then he went on to where she lived . He had never done that before , though even then he could not have said that she had ever forbidden him to come there unless she was with him . But he went there that night , expecting to find the house dark and asleep . The house was dark , but it was not asleep . He knew that , that beyond the dark shades of her room people were not asleep and that she was not there alone . How he knew it he could not have said . Neither would he admit what he knew . It 's just Max , ' he thought . It 's just Max . ' But he knew better . He knew that there was a man in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two weeks , though he knew that she was waiting for him . Then one night he was at the corner when she appeared . He struck her , without warning , feeling her flesh . He knew then what even yet he had not believed . " Oh , " she cried . He struck her again . " Not here ! " she whispered . " Not here ! " Then he found that she was crying . He had not cried since he could remember . He cried , cursing her , striking her . Then she was holding him . Even the reason for striking her was gone then . " Now , now , " she said . " Now , now . " They did not leave the corner even that night . They did not walk on loitering nor leave the road . They sat on a sloping grassbank and talked . She talked this time , telling him . It did not take much telling . He could see now what he discovered that he had known all the time : the idle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they spoke to her in passing , and she going back and forth , constant ,  | downlooking , and abject . Listening to her voice , he seemed to smell the odorreek of all the anonymous men above dirt . Her head was a little lowered as she talked , the big hands still on her lap . He could not see , of course . He did not have to see . " I thought you knew , " she said . " No , " he said . " I reckon I did n't . " " I thought you did . " " No , " he said . " I do nt reckon I did . " Two weeks later he had begun to smoke , squinting his face against the smoke , and he drank too . He would drink at night with Max and Mame and sometimes three or four other men and usually another woman or two , sometimes from the town , but usually strangers who would come in from Memphis and stay a week or a month , as waitresses behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did not always know their names , but he could cock his hat as they did ; during the evenings behind the drawn shades of the diningroom at Max 's he cocked it so and spoke of the waitress to the others , even in her presence , in his loud , drunken , despairing young voice , calling her his whore . Now and then in Max 's car he took her to dances in the country , always careful that McEachern should not hear about it . " I do nt know which he would be madder at , " he told her ; " at you or at the dancing . " Once they had to put him to bed , helpless , in the house where he had not even ever dreamed at one time that he could enter . The next morning the waitress drove him out home before daylight so he could get into the house before he was caught . And during the day McEachern watched him with dour and grudging approval . " But you have still plenty of time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | 9 McEACHERN lay in bed . The room was dark , but he was not asleep . He lay beside Mrs McEachern , whom he did believe to be sleeping , thinking fast and hard , thinking , The suit has been worn . But when . It could not have been during the day , because he is beneath my eyes , except on Saturday afternoons , But on any Saturday afternoon he could go to the barn , remove and hide the fit clothing which I require him to wear , and then don apparel which he would and could need only as some adjunct to sinning . ' It was as if he knew then , had been told . That would infer then that the garments were worn in secret , and therefore in all likelihood , at night . And if that were so , he refused to believe that the boy had other than one purpose : lechery . He had never committed lechery himself and he had not once failed to refuse to listen to anyone who talked about it . Yet within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of Joe 's doings as Joe himself could have told him , with the exception of names and places . Very likely he would not have believed those even from Joe 's mouth , since men of his kind usually  | have just as firmly fixed convictions about the mechanics , the theatring of evil as about those of good . Thus bigotry and clairvoyance were practically one , only the bigotry was a little slow , for as Joe , descending on his rope , slid like a fast shadow across the open and moonfilled window behind which McEachern lay , McEachern did not at once recognise him or perhaps believe what he saw , even though he could see the very rope itself . And when he got to the window Joe had already drawn the rope back and made it fast and was now on his way toward the barn . As McEachern watched him from the window , he felt something of that pure and impersonal outrage which a judge must feel were he to see a man on trial for his life lean and spit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lane halfway between the house and the road , he could see Joe at the mouth of the lane . He too heard the car and saw it come up and stop and Joe get into it . Possibly he did not even care who else was in it . Perhaps he already knew , and his purpose had been merely to see in which direction it went . Perhaps he believed that he knew that too , since the car could have gone almost anywhere in a country full of possible destinations with roads that led to them . Because he turned now back toward the house , walking fast , in that same pure and impersonal outrage , as if he believed so that he would be guided by some greater and purer outrage that he would not even need to doubt personal faculties . In carpet slippers , without a hat , his nightshirt thrust into his trousers and his braces dangling , he went straight as an arrow to the stable and saddled his big , old , strong white horse and returned back down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though Mrs McEachern from the kitchen door called his  | name when he rode out of the lot . He turned into the road at that slow and ponderous gallop , the two of them , man and beast , leaning a little stiffly forward as though in some juggernautish simulation of terrific speed though the actual speed itself was absent , as if in that cold and implacable and undeviating conviction of both omnipotence and clairvoyance of which they both partook known destination ' and speed were not necessary . He rode at that same speed straight to the place which he sought and which he had found out of a whole night and almost a whole half of a county , though it was not that far distant . He had gone hardly four miles when he heard music ahead and then he saw beside the road lights in a school house , a oneroom building . He had known where the building was , but he had had neither reason nor manner of knowing that there would be a dance held in it . But he rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars and buggies and saddled horses and mules which filled the grove which surrounded the school , and dismounted almost before the horse had stopped . He did not even tether it . He got down , and in the carpet slippers and the dangling braces and his round head and his short , blunt , outraged beard ran toward the open door and the open windows where the music came and where kerosenelit shadows passed in a certain orderly uproar . Perhaps , if he were thinking at all , he believed that he had been guided and were now being propelled by some militant Michael Himself as he entered the room . Apparently his eyes were not even momentarily at fault with the sudden light and the motion as he thrust among bodies with turned heads as , followed by a wake of astonishment and incipient pandemonium , he ran toward the youth  | whom he had adopted of his own free will and whom he had tried to raise as he was convinced was right . Joe and the waitress were dancing and Joe had not seen him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but perhaps she remembered him , or perhaps his appearance now was enough . Because she stopped dancing and upon her face came an expression very like horror , which Joe saw and turned . As he turned , McEachern was upon them . Neither had McEachern ever seen the woman but once , and very likely then he had not looked at her , just as he had refused to listen when men spoke of fornication . Yet he went straight to her , ignoring Joe for the moment . " Away , Jezebel ! " he said . His voice thundered , into the shocked silence , the shocked surrounding faces beneath the kerosene lamps , into the ceased music , into the peaceful moonlit night of young summer . " Away , harlot ! " Perhaps it did not seem to him that he had been moving fast nor that his voice was loud . Very likely he seemed to himself to be standing just and rocklike and with neither haste nor anger while on all sides the sluttishness of weak human men seethed in a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and retributive Throne . Perhaps they were not even his hands which struck at the face of the youth whom he had nurtured and sheltered and clothed from a child , and perhaps when the face ducked the blow and came up again it was not the face of that child . But he could not have been surprised at that , since it was not that child 's face which he was concerned with : it was the face of Satan , which he knew as well . And when , staring at the face , he walked steadily toward it with his hand still raised , very likely he walked toward it in the furious and dreamlike exaltation of a martyr who has al-  | ready been absolved , into the descending chair which Joe swung at his head , and into noth ? mess . Perhaps the nothingness astonished him a little , but not much , and not for long . Then to Joe it all rushed away , roaring , dying , leaving him in the center of the floor , the shattered chair clutched in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McEachern lay on his back . He looked quite peaceful now . He appeared to sleep : bluntheaded , indomitable even in repose , even the blood on his forehead peaceful and quiet . Joe was breathing hard . He could hear it , and also something else , thin and shrill and far away . He seemed to listen to it for a long time before he recognised it for a voice , a woman 's voice . He looked and saw two men holding her and she writhing and struggling , her hair shaken forward , her white face wrung and ugly beneath the splotches of savage paint , her mouth a small jagged hole filled with shrieking . " Calling me a harlot ! " she screamed , wrenching at the men who held her . " That old son of a bitch ! Let go ! Let go ! " Then her voice stopped making words again and just screamed ; she writhed and threshed , trying to bite the hands of the men who struggled with her . Still carrying the shattered chair Joe walked toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others watched him : . ethe girls in stiff offcolors and mailorder stockings and heels ; the men , young men in illcut and boardlike garments also from the mailorder , with hard , ruined hands and eyes already revealing a heritage of patient brooding upon endless furrows and the slow buttocks of mules . Joe began to run , brandishing the chair . " Let her go ! " he said . At once she ceased struggling and turned on him the fury , the shriek-  | ing , as if she had just seen him , realised that he was also there . " And you ! You brought me here . Goddamn bastard clodhopper . Bastard you ! Son of a bitch you and him too . Putting him at me that never ever saw ? " Joe did not appear to be running at anyone in particular , and his face was quite calm beneath the uplifted chair . The others fell back from about the woman , freeing her , though she continued to wrench her arms as if she did not yet realise it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He whirled , swinging the chair ; yet his face was still quite calm . " Back ! " he said , though no one had moved toward him at all . They were all as still and as silent as the man on the floor . He swung the chair , backing now toward the door . " Stand back ! I said I would kill him some day ! I told him so ! " He swung the chair about him , calmfaced , backing toward the door . " Do nt a one of you move , now , " he said , looking steadily and ceaselessly at faces that might have been masks . Then he flung the chair down and whirled and sprang out the door , into soft , dappled moonlight . He overtook the waitress as she was getting into the car in which they had come . He was panting , yet his voice was calm too : a sleeping face merely breathing hard enough to make sounds . " Get on back to town , " he said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apparently he was not aware of what he was saying nor of what was happening ; when the woman turned suddenly in the door of the car and began to beat him in the face he did not move , his voice did not change : " Yes . That 's right . I 'll be there soon as I ? " Then he turned and ran , while she was still striking at him . He could not have known where McEachern had left the horse , nor for certain if it was even there . Yet he ran  | straight to it , with something of his adopted father 's coln. plete faith in an infallibility in events . He got onto it and swung it back toward the road . The car had already turned into the road . He saw the taillight diminish and disappear . The old , strong , farmbred horse returned home at its slow and steady canter . The youth upon its back rode lightly , balanced lightly , leaning well forward , exulting perbaps at that moment as Faustus had , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shalt Not , of being free at last of honor and law . In the motion the sweet sharp sweat of the horse blew , sulphuric ; the invisible wind flew past . He cried aloud , " I have done it ! I have done it ! I told them I would ! " He entered the lane and rode through the moonlight up to the house without slowing . He had thought it would be dark , but it was not . He did not pause ; the careful and hidden rope were as much a part of his dead life now as honor and hope , and the old wearying woman who had been one of his enemies for thirteen years and who was now awake , waiting for him . The light was in hers and McEachern 's bedroom and she was standing in the door , with a shawl over her nightdress . " Joe ? " she said . He came down the hall fast . His face looked as McEachern had seen it as the chair fell . Perhaps she could not yet see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Paw rode away on the horse . I heard . . . " She saw his face then . But she did not even have time to step back . He did not strike her ; his hand on her arm was quite gentle . It was just hurried , getting her out of the path , out of the door . He swept her aside as he might have a curtain across the door . " He 's at a dance , " he said . " Get away , old woman . " She turned , clutching the shawl with one hand , her other  | against the door face as she fell back , watching him as he crossed the room and began to run up the stairs which mounted to his attic . Without stopping he looked back . Then she could see his teeth shining in the lamp . " At a dance , you hear ? He 's not dancing , though . " He laughed back , into the lamp ; he turned his head and his laughing , running on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upward from the head down as if he were running headfirst and laughing into something that was obliterating him like a picture in chalk being erased from a blackboard . She followed , toiling up the stairs . She began to follow almost as soon as he passed her , as if that implacable urgency which had carried her husband away had returned like a cloak on the shoulders of the boy and had been passed from him in turn to her . She dragged herself up the cramped stair , clutching the rail with one hand and the shawl with the other . She was not speaking , not calling to him . It was as though she were a phantom obeying the command sent back by the absent master . Joe had not lighted his lamp . But the room was filled with refracted moonglow , and even without that very likely she could have told what he was doing . She held herself upright by the wall , fumbling her hand along the wall until she reached the bed and sank onto it , sitting . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the loose plank was , he was already approaching toward the bed , where the moonlight fell directly , and she watched him empty the tin can onto the bed and sweep the small mass of coins and bills into his hand and ram the hand into his pocket . Only then did he look at her as she sat , backfallen a little now , propped on one arm and holding the shawl with the other hand . " I did n't ask you for it , " he said . " Re-  | member that . I did n't ask , because I was afraid you would give it to me . I just took it . Do nt forget that . " He was turning almost before his voice ceased . She watched him turn into the lamplight which fell up the stair , descending . He passed out of sight , but she could still hear him . She heard him in the hall again , fast , and after a while she heard the horse again , galloping ; and after a while the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere when Joe urged the now spent old horse through the main street of town . The horse had been breathing hard for some time now , but Joe still held it at a stumbling trot with a heavy stick that fell rhythmically across its rump . It was not a switch : it was a section of broom handle which had been driven into Mrs McEachern 's flower bed in front of the house for something to grow on . Though the horse was still going through the motion of galloping , it was not moving much faster than a man could walk . The stick too rose and fell with the same spent and terrific slowness , the youth on the horse 's back leaning forward as if he did not know that the horse had flagged , or as though to lift forward and onward the failing beast whose slow hooves rang with a measured hollow sound through the empty and da led street . It ? the horse and the rider  --  had a strange , dreamy effect , like a moving picture in slow motion as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old corner where he used to wait , less urgent perhaps but not less eager , and more young . The horse was not even trotting now , on stiff legs , its breathing deep and labored and rasping , each breath a groan . The stick still fell ; as the progress of the horse  | slowed , the speed of the stick increased in exact ratio . But the horse slowed , sheering into the curb . Joe pulled at its head , beating it , but it slowed into the curb and stopped , sled , its head down , trembling , its breathing almost like a human voice . Yet still the rider leaned forward in the arrested saddle , in the attitude of terrific speed , beating the horse across the rump with the stick . Save for the rise and fall of the stick and the groaning respirations of the animal , they might have been an equestrian statue strayed from its pedestal and come to rest in an attitude of ultimate exhaustion in a quiet and mpty ) street splotched and dappled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's head and began to tug it , as if he would drag it into motion by main strength and then spring onto its back . The horse did not move . He desisted ; he seemed to be leaning a little toward the horse . Again they were m ti nless : the spent beast and the youth , facing one another , their heads quite near , as if carved in an attitude of listening or of prayer or of consultation . Then Joe raised the stick and fell to beating the horse about its motionless head . He beat it steadily until the stick broke . He continued to strike it with a fragment not much longer than his hand . But perhaps he realised that he was inflicting no pain , or perhaps his arm grew tired at last , because he threw the stick away and turned , whirled , already in full stride . He did not look back . Diminishing , his white shirt pulsing and fading in the moonshadows , he ran as completely out of the life of the horse as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he used to wait . If he noticed , thought , at all , he must have said My God how long . How long ago that was The street curved into the gravel road .  | He had almost a mile yet to go , so he ran not fast but carefully , steadily , his face lowered a little as if he contemplated the spurned road beneath his feet , his elbows at his sides like a trained runner . The road curved on , moonblanched , bordered at wide intervals by the small , random , new , terrible little houses in which people who came yesterday from nowhere and tomorrow will be gone wherenot , dwell on the edges of towns . They were all dark save the one toward which he ran . He reached the house and turned from the road , running , his feet measured and loud in the late silence . Perhaps he could see already the waitress , in a dark dress for travelling , with her hat on and her bag packed , waiting . ( How they were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never thought . ) And perhaps Max and Mame too , likely undressed  --  Max coatless or maybe even in his undershirt , and Mame in the light blue kimono  --  the two of them bustling about in that loud , cheerful , seeing-someone-off way . But actually he was not thinking at all , since he had never told the waitress to get ready to leave at all . Perhaps he believed that he had told her , or that she should know , since his recent doings and his future plans must have seemed to him simple enough for anyone to understand . Perhaps he even believed that he had told her he was going home in order to get money when she got into the car . He ran onto the porch . Heretofore , even during his heydey in the house , his impulse had been always to glide from the road and into the shadow of the porch and into the house itself where he was expected , as swiftly and inconspicuously as possible . He knocked . There was a light in her room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he had expected ; and voices from beyond the curtained windows  | too , several voices which he could discern to be intent rather than cheerful : that he expected too , thinking Perhaps they think I am not coming . That damn horse . That damn horse He knocked again , louder , putting his hand on the knob , shaking it , pressing his face against the curtained glass in the front door . The voices ceased . Then there was no sound whatever from within the house . The two lights , the lighted shade to her room and the opaque curtain in the door , burned with a steady and unwavering glare , as if all the people in the house had suddenly died when he touched the knob . He knocked again , with scarce interval between ; he was still knocking when the door ( no shadow ! had fallen upon the curtain and no step had approached beyond it ) fled suddenly and silently from under his rapping hand . He was already stepping across the threshold as if he were attached to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocking it . He was completely dressed , even to the hat . " Well , well , well , " he said . His voice was not loud , and it was almost as if he had drawn Joe swiftly into the hall and shut the door and locked it before Joe knew that he was inside . Yet his voice held again that ambiguous quality , that quality hearty and completely empty and completely without pleasure or mirth , like a shell , like something he carried before his face and watched Joe through it , which in the past had caused Joe to look at Max with something between puzzlement and anger . " Here 's Romeo at last , " he said . " The Beale Street Playboy . " Then he spoke a little louder , saying Romeo quite loud . " Come in and meet the folks . " Joe was already moving toward the door which he knew , very nearly running again , if he had ever actually stopped . He was not listening to Max . He had never heard of Beale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in comparison with which Harlem is a movie set . Joe had not looked at anything . Because suddenly he saw the blonde woman standing in the hall at the rear . He had not seen her emerge into - the hall at all , yet it was empty when he entered . And then suddenly she was standing there . She was dressed , in a dark skirt , and she held a hat in her hand . And just beyond an open dark door beside him was a pile of luggage , several bags . Perhaps he did not see them . Or perhaps looking saw once , faster than thought I did n't think she would have that many Perhaps he thought then for the first time that they had nothing to travel in , thinking How can I carry all those But he did not pause , already turning toward the door which he knew . It was only as he put his hand on the door that he became aware of complete silence beyond it , a silence which he at eighteen knew that it would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not pause ; perhaps he was not even aware that the hall was empty again , that the blonde woman had vanished again without his having seen or heard her move . He opened the door . He was running now ; that is , as a man might run far ahead of himself and his knowing in the act of stopping stock still . The waitress sat on the bed as he had seen her sitting so many times . She wore the dark dress and the hat , as he had expected , known . She sat with her face lowered , not even looking at the door when it opened , a cigarette burning in one still hand that looked almost monstrous in its immobility against the dark dress . And in the same instant he saw the second man . He had never seen the man before . But he did not realise this now . It was only later that he remembered that , and remembered the piled luggage in the dark room which he  | had looked at for an instant while thought went faster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also smoking . His hat was tipped forward so ' that the shadow of the brim fell across his mouth . He was not old , yet he did not look young either . He and Max might have been brothers in the sense that any two white men strayed suddenly into an African village might look like brothers to them who live there . His face , his chin where the light fell upon it , was still . Whether or not the stranger was looking at him , Joe did not know . And that Max was standing just behind him Joe did not know either . And he heard their actual voices without knowing what they said , without even listening : Ask him How would he know Perhaps he heard the words . But likely not . Likely they were as yet no more significant than the rasping of insects beyond the closedrawn window , or the packed bags which he had looked at and had not yet seen . He cleared out right afterward , Bobbie said He might know . Let 's find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least Though Joe had not moved since he entered , he was still running . When Max touched his shoulder he turned as if he had been halted in midstride . He had not been aware that Max was even in the room . He looked at Max over his shoulder with a kind of furious annoyance . " Let 's have it , kid , " Max said . " What about it ? " " What about what ? " Joe said . " The old guy . Do you think you croaked him ? Let 's have it straight . You do nt want to get Bobbie in a jam . " " Bobbie , " Joe said , thinking Bobbie . Bobbie He turned ,  | running again ; this time Max caught his shoulder , though not hard . " Come on , " Max said . " Ai nt we all friends here ? Did you croak him ? " " Croak him ? " Joe said , in that fretted tone of impatience and restraint , as if he were being detained and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The one you crowned with the chair . Is he dead ? " " Dead ? " Joe said . He looked at the stranger . When he did so , he saw the waitress again and he ran again . He actually moved now . He had completely dismissed the two men from his mind . He went to the bed , dragging at his pocket , on his face an expression both exalted and victorious . The waitress did not look at him . She had not looked at him once since he entered , though very likely he had completely forgot that . She had not moved ; the cigarette still burned in her hand . Her motionless hand looked as big and dead and pale as a piece of cooking meat . Again someone grasped him by the shoulder . It was the stranger now . The stranger and Max stood shoulder to shoulder , looking at Joe . " Quit stalling , " the stranger said . " If you croaked the guy , say so . It cant be any secret long . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside . " " I do nt know , I tell you ! " Joe said . He looked from one to the other , fretted but not yet glaring . " I hit him . He fell down . I told him I was going to do it someday . " He looked from one to the other of the still , almost identical faces . He began to jerk his shoulder under the stranger 's hand . Max spoke . " What did you come here for , then ? " " What did ? " Joe said . " What did I . . . " he said , in a  | tone of fainting amazement , glaring from face to face with a sort of outraged yet still patient exasperation . " What did I come for ? I came to get Bobbie . Do you think that I ? when I went all the way home to get the money to get married ? " Again he completely forgot , dismissed them . He jerked free and turned to the woman with once more that expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that moment the two men were blown as completely out of his life as two scraps of paper . Very likely he was not even aware when Max went to the door and called and a moment later the blonde woman entered . He was bending above the bed upon which sat the immobile and downlooking waitress , stooping above her , dragging the wadded mass of coins and bills from his pocket , onto her lap and onto the bed beside her . " Here ! Look at it . Look . I 've got . See ? " Then the wind blew upon him again , like in the school house three hours ago among the gaped faces there of which he had for the time been oblivious . He stood in a quiet , dreli state , erect now where the upward spring of the sitting waitress had knocked him , and saw her , on her feet , gather up the wadded and scattered money and fling it ; he saw quietly her face strained , the mouth screaming , the eyes screaming too . He alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice alone quiet enough to register upon the ear : " You mean you wont ? " he said . " You mean , you wont ? " It was very much like it had been in the school house : someone holding her as she struggled and shrieked , her hair wild with the jerking and tossing of her head ; her face , even her mouth , in contrast to the hair as still as a  | dead mouth in a dead face . " Bastard ! Son of a bitch ! Getting me into a jam , that always treated you like you were a white man . A white man ! " But very likely to him even yet it was just noise , not registering at all : just a part of the long wind . He just stared at her , at the face which he had never seen before , aying quietly ( whether aloud or not , he could not have said ) in a slow amazement : Why , I committed murder for her . I even stole for her as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , been told that he had done it . Then she too seemed to blow out of his life on the long wind like a third scrap of paper . He began to swing his arm as if the hand still clutched the shattered chair . The blonde woman had been in the room some time . He saw her for the first time , without surprise , having apparently materialised out of thin air , m ti c s , with that diamondsurfaced tranquillity which invested her with a respectability as implacable and calm as the white lifted glove of a policeman , not a hair out of place . She now wore the pale blue kimono over the dark garment for travelling . She said quietly : " Take him . Let 's get out of here . There 'll be a cop out here soon . They 'll know where to look for him . " Perhaps Joe did not hear her at all , nor the screaming waitress : " He told me himself he was a nigger ! The son of a bitch ! Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitch that would get me in a jam with clodhopper police . At a clodhopper dance ! " Perhaps he heard only the long wind , as , swinging his hand as though it still clutched the chair , he sprang forward upon the two men . Very likely he did not even know that they were already moving toward him . Because with something of the exaltation of his adopted father he sprang full and of his own accord into the  | stranger 's fist . Perhaps he did not feel either blow , though the stranger struck him twice in the face before he reached the floor , where like the man whom he had struck down , he lay upon his back , quite still . But he was not out because his eyes were still open , looking quietly up at them . There was nothing in his eyes at all , no pain , no surprise . But apparently he could not move ; he just lay there with a profoundly contemplative expression , looking quietly up at the two men , and the blonde woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast statue . Perhaps he could not hear the voices either , or perhaps he did and they once more had no more significance than the dry buzzing of the steady insects beyond the window : Bitching up as sweet a little setup as I could have wanted He ought to stay away from bitches He cant help himself . He was born too close to one Is he really a nigger ? He do nt look like one That 's what he told Bobbie one night . But I guess she still do nt know any more about what he is than he does . These country bastards are liable to be anything We 'll find out . We 'll see if his blood is black Lying peaceful and still Joe watched the stranger lean down and lift his head from the floor and strike him again in the face , this time with a short slashing blow . After a moment he licked his lip a little , somewhat as a child might lick a cooking spoon . He watched the stranger 's hand go back . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get on to Memphis Just one more Joe lay quietly and watched the hand . Then Max was beside the stranger , stooping too . We 'll need a little more blood to tell for sure  | Sure . He do nt need to worry . This one is on the house too The hand did not fall . Then the blonde woman was there too . She was holding the stranger 's lifted arm by the wrist . I said that will do  | 10 KNOWING not grieving remembers a thousand savage and lonely streets . They run from that night when he lay and heard the final footfall and then the final door ( they did not even turn the light out ) and then lay quietly , on his back , with open eyes while above the suspended globe burned with aching and unwavering glare as though in the house where all the people had died . He did not know how long he lay there . He was not thinking at all , not suffering . Perhaps he was conscious of somewhere within him the two severed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , waiting to touch , to knit anew so that he could move . While they finished their preparations to depart they stepped now and then across him , like people about to vacate a house forever will across some object which they intend to leave . Here bobbie here kid heres your comb you forgot it heres romeos chicken feed too jesus he must have tapped the sunday school till on the way out its bobbies now did nt you see him give it to her did nt you see old bighearted Mats right pick it up kid you can keep it as an installment or a souvenir or something  | what do nt she want it well say Mats too bad now thats tough but we cant leave it lay here on the floor itll rot a hole in the floor its already helped to rot one hole pretty big for its size pretty big for any size hey bobbie hey kid sure ill just keep it for bobbie like hell you will well i mean ill keep half of it for bobbie leave it there you bastards what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sweet jesus what does he want with it he does nt use money he does nt need it ask bobbie if he needs money they give it to him that the rest of us have to pay for it leave it there i said like hell this ai nt mine to leave its bobbies it ai nt yours neither unless sweet jesus youre going to tell me he owes you jack too that he has been f  --  ing you too behind my back on credit i said leave it go chase yourself it ai nt but five or six bucks apiece Then the blonde woman stood above him and stooping , he watching quietly , she lifted her skirt and took from the top of her stocking a flat folded sheaf of banknotes and removed one and stopped and thrust it into the fob pocket of his trousers . Then she was gone . get on get out of here you ai nt ready yet yourself you got to put that kimono in and close your bag and powder your face again bring my bag and hat in here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags and get in the car and wait for me and max you think im going to leave either one of you here alone to steal that one of of him too go on now get out of here Then they were gone : the final feet , the final door . Then he heard the car drown the noise of the insects , riding above , sinking to the level , sinking below the level so that he heard only the insects . He lay there beneath the light . He could not move yet , as he could look without actually seeing , hear without actually knowing ; the two wireends  | not yet knit as he lay peacefully , licking his lips now and then as a child does . Then the wireends knit and made connection . He did not know the exact instant , save that suddenly he was aware of his ringing head , and he sat up slowly , discovering himself again , getting to his feet . He was dizzy ; the room went round him , slowly and smoothly as thinking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no pain , not even when , propped before the bureau , he examined in the glass his swollen and bloody face and touched his face . " Sweet Jesus , " he said . " They sure beat me up . " He was not thinking yet ; it had not yet risen that far I reckon I better get out of here I reckon I better get out of here He went toward the door , his hands out before him like a blind man or a sleepwalker . He was in the hall without having remembered passing through the door , and he found himself in another bedroom while he still hoped perhaps not believed that he was moving toward the front door . It was small too . Yet it still seemed to be filled with the presence of the blonde woman , its very cramped harsh walls bulged outward with that militant and diamondsurfaced respectability . On the hare bureau sat a pint bottle almost full of whiskey . He drank it , slowly , not feeling the fire at all , holding himself upright by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat cold as molasses , without taste . He set the empty bottle down and leaned on the bureau , his head lowered , not thinking , waiting perhaps without knowing it , perhaps not even waiting . Then the whiskey began to burn in him and he began to shake his head slowly from side to side , while thinking became one with the slow , hot coiling and recoiling of his entrails : I got to get out of here . ' He reentered the hall . Now it was  | his head that was clear and his body that would not behave . He had to coax it along the hall , sliding it along one wall toward the front , thinking , Come on , now ; pull yourself together . I got to get out . ' Thinking If I can just get it outside , into the air , the cool air , the cool dark He watched his hands fumbling at the door , trying to help them , to coax and control them . Anyway , they did n't lock it on me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have got out until morning then . It never would have opened a window and climbed through it . ' He opened the door at last and passed out and closed the door behind him , arguing again with his body which did not want to bother to close the door , having to be forced to close it upon the empty house where the two lights burned with their dead and unwavering glare , not knowing that the house was empty and not caring , not caring anymore for silence and desolation than they had cared for the cheap and brutal nights of stale oftused glasses and stale oftused beds . His body was acquiescing better , becoming docile . He stepped from the dark porch , into the moonlight , and with his bloody head and his empty stomach hot , savage , and courageous with whiskey , he entered the street which was to run for fifteen years . The whiskey died away in time and was renewed and died again , but the street ran on . From that night the thousand streets ran as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken by intervals of begged and stolen rides , on trains and trucks , and on country wagons with he at twenty and twentyfive and thirty sitting on the seat with his still , hard face and the clothes ( even when soiled and worn ) of a city man and the driver of the wagon not knowing who or what the passenger was and not daring  | to ask . The street ran into Oklahoma and Missouri and as far south as Mexico and then back north to Chicago and Detroit and then back south again and at last to Mississippi . It was fifteen years long : it ran between the savage and spurious board fronts of oil towns where , his inevitable serge clothing and light shoes black with bottomless mud , he ate crude food from tin dishes that cost him ten and fifteen dollars a meal and paid for them with a roll of banknotes the size of a bullfrog and stained too with the rich mud that seemed as bottomless as the gold which it excreted . It ran through yellow wheat fields waving beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haystacks beneath the cold mad moon of September , and the brittle stars : he was in turn laborer , miner , prospector , gambling tout ; he enlisted in the army , served four months and deserted and was never caught . And always , sooner or later , the street ran through cities , through an identical and wellnigh interchangeable section of cities without remembered names , where beneath the dark and equivocal and symbolical archways of midnight he bedded with the women and paid them when he had the money , and when he did not have it he bedded anyway and then told them that he was a negro . For a while it worked ; that was while he was still in the south . It was quite simple , quite easy . Usually all he risked was a cursing from the woman and the matron of the house , though now and then he was beaten unconscious by other patrons , to waken later in the street or in the jail . That was while he was still in the ( comparatively speaking ) south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose from the bed and told the woman that he was a negro . " You are ? " she said . " I thought maybe you were just another wop or something . " She looked at him , without  | particular interest ; then she evidently saw something in his face : she said , " What about it ? You look all right . You ought to seen the shine I turned out just before your turn came . " She was looking at him . She was quite still now . " Say , what do you think this dump is , anyhow ? The Ritz hotel ? " Then she quit talking . She was watching his face and she began to move backward slowly before him , staring at him , her face draining , her mouth open to scream . Then she did scream . It took two policemen to subdue him . At first they thought that the woman was dead . He was sick after that . He did not know until then that there were white women who would take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years . Sometimes he would remember how he had once tricked or teased white men into calling him a negro in order to fight them , to beat them or be beaten ; now he fought the negro who called him white . He was in the north now , in Chicago and then Detroit . He lived with ne groes , shunning white people . He ate with them , slept with them , belligerent , unpredictable , uncommunicative . He now lived as man and wife with a woman who resembled an ebony carving . At night he would lie in bed beside her , sleepless , beginning to breathe deep and hard . He would do it deliberately , feeling , even watching , his white chest arch deeper and deeper within his ribcage , trying to breathe into himself the dark odor , the dark and inscrutable thinking and being of negroes , with each suspiration trying to expel from himself the white blood and the white thinking and being . And all the while his nostrils at the odor which he was trying to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writhe and strain with physical outrage and spiritual denial .  | He thought that itwas loneliness which he was trying to escape and nothimself . But the street ran on : catlike , one place was the same as another to him . But in none of them could he be quiet . But the street ran on in its moods and phases , always empty he might have seen himself as in numberless avatars ; in silence , doomed with motion , driven by the courage of flagged and spurred despair ; by the despair of courage whose opportunities had to be flagged and spurred . He was thirt years old . One afternoon the street had become a Mississippi country road . He had been put off a southbound freight train near a small town . He did not know the name of the town ; he did n't care what word it used for name . He did n't even see it , anyway . He skirted it , following the woods , and came to the road and looked in both directions . It was not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used . He saw several negro cabins scattered here and there along it ; then he saw , about a half mile away , a larger house . It was a big house set in a grove of trees ; obviously a place of some pretensions at one time . But now the trees needed pruning and the house had not been painted in years . But he could tell that it was inhabited , and he had not eaten in twentyfour hours . That one might do , ' he thought . But he did not approach it at once , though the afternoon was drawing on . Instead he turned his back upon it and went on in the other direction , in his soiled white shirt and worn serge trousers and his cracked , dusty , townshaped shoes , his cloth cap set at an arrogant angle above a threeday 's stubble . Yet even then he did not look like a tramp ; at least apparently not to the negro boy whom he met presently coming up the road and swinging a tin  | bucket . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house back there ? " he said . " That where Miz Burden stay at . " " Mr and Mrs Burden ? " " No , sir . Ai nt no Mr Burden . Ai nt nobody live there but her . " " Oh . An old woman , I guess . " " No , sir . Miz Burden ai nt old . Ai nt young neither . " " And she lives there by herself . Do nt she get scared ? " " Who going to harm her , right here at town ? Colored folks around here looks after her . " " Colored folks look after her ? " At once it was as if the boy had closed a door between himself and the man who questioned him . " I reckon ai nt nobody round here going to do her no harm . She ai nt harmed nobody . " " I guess not , " Christmas said . " How far is it to the next town over this way ? " " ' Bout thirty miles , they say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No , " Christmas said . He turned then , going on . The boy looked after him . Then he too turned , walking again , the tin bucket swinging against his faded flank . A few steps later he looked back . The man who had questioned him was walking on , steadily though not fast . The boy went on again , in his faded , patched , scant overalls . He was barefoot . Presently he began to shuffle , still moving forward , the red dust rising about his lean , chocolatecolored shanks and the frayed legs of the too short overalls ; he began to chant , tuneless , rhythmic , musical , though on a single note :  | Say do nt did n't . Did n't do nt who . Want dat yaller gal 's Padden do nt hide . Lying in a tangle of shrubbery a hundred yards from the house , Christmas heard a far clock strike nine and then ten . Before him the house bulked square and huge from its mass of trees . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not drawn and he could see that the light was a kerosene lamp , and now and then he saw through the window the shadow of a moving person cross the further wall . But he never saw the person at all . After a while the light went out . The house was now dark ; he quit watching it then . He lay in the copse , on his belly on the dark earth . In the copse the darkness was impenetrable ; through his shirt and trousers it felt a little chill , close , faintly dank , as if the sun never reached the atmosphere which the copse held . He could feel the neversunned earth strike , slow and receptive , against him through his clothes : groin , hip , belly , breast , forearms . His arms were crossed , his forehead rested upon them , in his nostrils the damp rich odor of the dark and fecund earth . He did not look once again toward the dark house . He lay perfectly still in the copse for more than an hour before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was nothing skulking nor even especially careful about his approach to the house . He simply went quietly as if that were his natural manner of moving and passed around the now dimensionless bulk of the house , toward the rear , where the kitchen would be . He made no more noise than  | a cat as he paused and stood for a while beneath the window where the light had shown . In the grass about his feet the crickets , which had ceased as he moved , keeping a little island of silence about him like thin yellow shadow of their small voices , began again , ceasing again when he moved with that tiny and alert suddenness . From the rear of the house a single storey wing projected . That will be the kitchen , ' he thought . Yes . That will be it . ' He walked without sound , moving in his tiny island of abruptly ceased insects . He could discern a door in the kitchen wall . He would have found it unlocked if he had tried it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath a window . Before he tried it he remembered that he had seen no screen in the lighted window upstai'rs . The window was even open , propped open with a stick . What do you think about that , ' he thought . He stood beside the window , his hands on the sill , breathing quietly , not listening , not hurrying , as if there were no need for haste anywhere under the sun . Well . Well . Well . What do you know about that . Well . Well . Well . ' Then he climbed into the window ; he seemed to flow into the dark kitchen : a shadow returning without a sound and without locomotion to the allmother of obscurity and darkness . Perhaps he thought of that other window which he had used to use and of the rope upon which he had had to rely ; perhaps not . Very likely not , no more than a cat would recall another window ; like the cat , he also seemed to see in the darkness as he moved as unerringly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew where it would be ; that , or were being manipulated by an agent which did know . He ate something from an invisible dish , with invisible fingers :  | invisible food . He did not care what it would be . He did not know that he had even wondered or tasted until his jaw stopped suddenly in midchewing and thinking fled for twentyfive years back down the street , past all the imperceptible corners of bitter defeats and more bitter victories , and five miles even beyond a corner where he used to wait in the terrible early time cf love , for someone whose name he had forgot ; five miles even beyond that it went I 'll know it in a minute . I have eaten it before , somewhere . In a minute I will memory clicking knowing I see I see I more than see hear I hear I see my head bent I hear the ' monotonous dogmatic voice which I believe will never cease going on and on forever and peeping I see the indomitable bullet head the clean blunt beard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so nothungry and I smelling my mouth and tongue weeping the hot salt of waiting my eyes tasting the hot steam from the dish " It 's peas , " he said , aloud . " For sweet Jesus . Field peas cooked with molasses . " . More of him than thinking may have been absent ; he should have heard the sound before he did , since whoever was creating it was trying no more for silence and caution than he had . Perhaps he did hear it . But he did not move at all as the soft sound of slippered feet approached the kitchen from the house side of it , and when he did at last turn suddenly , his eyes glowing suddenly , he saw already beneath the door which entered the house itself , the faint approaching light . The open window was at his hand : he could have been through it in a single step almost . But he did not move . He did n't even set down the dish . He did not even cease to chew . Thus he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dish and chewing , when the door opened and the woman entered . She wore a faded dressing  | gown and she carried a candle , holding it high , so that its light fell upon her face : a face quiet , grave , utterly unalarmed . In the soft light of the candle she looked to be not much past thirty . She stood in the door . They looked at one another for more than a minute , almost in the same attitude : he with the dish , she with the candle . He had stopped chewing now . " If it is just food you want , you will find that , " she said in a voice calm , a little deep , quite cold .  | BY the light of the candle she did not look much more than thirty , in the soft light downfalling upon the softungirdled presence of a woman prepared for sleep . When he saw her by daylight he knew that she was better than thirtyfive . Later she told him that she was forty . Which means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , ' he thought . But it was not that first night , nor for many succeeding ones , that she told him that much even . She told him very little , anyway . They talked very little , and that casually , even after he was the lover of her spinster 's bed . Sometimes he could almost believe that they did not talk at all , that he did n't know her at all . It was as though there were two people : the one whom he saw now and then by day and looked at while they spoke to one ' another with speech that told nothing at all since it did n't try to and did n't intend to ; the other with whom he lay at night and did n't even see , speak to , at all . Even after a year ( he was working at the planing mill now ) when he saw her by day at all , it would be on Sat  | urday afternoon or Sunday or when he would come to the house for the food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen table . Now and then she would come to the kitchen , though she would never stay while he ate , and at times she met him at the back porch , where during the first four or five months of his residence in the cabin below the house , they would stand for a while and talk almost like strangers . They always stood : she in one of her apparently endless succession of clean calico house dresses and sometimes a cloth sunbonnet like a countrywoman , and he in a clean white shirt now and the serge trousers creased now every week . They never sat down to talk . He had never seen her sitting save one time when he looked through a downstairs window and saw her writing at a desk in the room . And it was a year after he had remarked without curiosity the volume of mail which she received and sent , and that for a certain period of each forenoon she would sit at the worn , scarred , rolltop desk in one of the scarceused and sparsely furnished downstairs rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received were business and private documents with fifty different postmarks and what she sent were replies  --  advice , business , financial and religious , to the presidents and faculties and trustees , and advice personal and practical to young girl students and even alumnae , of a dozen negro schools and colleges through the south . Now and then she would be absent from home three and four days at a time , and though he could now see her at his will on any night , it was a year before he learned that in these absences she visited the schools in person and talked to the teachers and the students . Her business affairs were conducted by a negro lawyer in Memphis , who was a trustee of one of the  | schools , and in whose safe , along with her will , reposed the written instructions ( in her own hand ) for the disposal of her body after death . When he learned that , he understood the town 's attitude toward her , though he knew that the town did not know as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wont be bothered here . ' One day he realised that she had never invited him inside the house proper . He had never been further than the kitchen , which he had already entered of his own accord , thinking , liplifted , She could n't keep me out of here . I guess she knows that . ' And he had never entered the kitchen by day save when he came to get the food which she prepared for him and set out upon the table . And when he entered the house at night it was as he had entered it that first night ; he felt like a thief , a robber , even while he mounted to the bedroom where she waited . Even after a year it was as though he entered by stealth to despoil her virginity each time anew . It was as though each turn of dark saw him faced again with the necessity to despoil again that which he had already despoiled  --  or never had and never would . Sometimes he thought of it in that way , remembering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that surrender . A spiritual privacy so long intact that its own instinct for preservation had immolated it , its physical phase the strength and fortitude of a man . A dual personality : the one the woman at first sight of whom in the lifted candle ( or perhaps the very sound of the slippered approaching feet ) there had opened before him , instantaneous as a landscape in a lightningflash , a horizon of physical security and adultery if not pleasure ; the other the mantrained muscles and the mantrained habit  | of thinking born of heritage and environment with which he had to fight up to the final instant . There was no feminine vacillation , no coyness of obvious desire and intention to succumb at last . It was as if he struggled physically with another man for an object of no actual value to either , and for which they struggled on principle alone . When he saw her next , he thought , My God . How little I know about women , when I thought I knew so much . ' It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being spoken to by her , it was as though what memory of less than twelve hours knew to be true could never have happened , thinking Under her clothes she cant even be made so that it could have happened He had not started to work at the mill then . Most of that day he spent lying on his back on the cot which she had loaned him , in the cabin which II she had given him to live in , smoking , his hands beneath his head . My God , ' he thought , it was like I was the woman and she was the man . ' But that was not right , either . Because she had resisted to the very last . But it was not woman resistance , that resistance which , if really meant , can not be overcome by any man for the reason that the woman observes no rules of physical combat . But Ali she had resisted fair , by the rules that decreed that upon a certain crisis one was defeated , whether the end of resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw the light go out in the kitchen and then come on in her room . He went to the house . He did not go in eagerness , but in a Iquiet rage . " I 'll show her , " he said aloud . He did not try to be quiet . He entered the house boldly and mounted the stairs ; she heard him at once . " Who is it ? " she said . But there was no alarm in her tone . He did n't answer . He mounted the stairs and entered the room . She was still dressed , turning , watching the door as he entered . But she did not speak to him . She just watched him as he went to the table and blew out the lamp , thinking , Now she 'll run . ' And so he sprang forward , toward the door to intercept her . But she did not flee . He found her in the dark exactly where the light had lost her , in the same attitude . He began to tear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a tense , hard , low voice : " I 'll show you ! I 'll show the bitch ! " She did not resist at all . It was almost as though she were helping him , with small changes of position of limbs when the ultimate need for help arose . But beneath his hands the body might have been . the body of a dead woman not yet stiffened . But he did not desist ; though his hands were hard and urgent it was with rage alone . At least I have made a woman of her at last , ' he thought . Now she hates me . I have taught her that , at least . '  | The next day he lay again all day long on his cot in the cabin . He ate nothing ; he did not even go to the kitchen to see if she had left food for him . He was waiting for sunset , dusk . Then I 'll blow , ' he thought . He did not expect ever to see her again . Better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to turn me out of the cabin too . That much , anyway . No white woman ever did that . Only a nigger woman ever give me the air , turned me out . ' So he lay on the cot , smoking , waiting for sunset . Through the open door he watched the sun slant and lengthen and turn copper . Then the copper faded into lilac , into the fading lilac of full dusk . He could hear the frogs then , and . fireflies began to drift across the open frame of the door , growing brighter as the dusk faded . Then he rose . He owned nothing but the razor ; when he had put that into his pocket , he was ready to travel one mile or a thousand ,  | wherever the street of the imperceptible corners should choose to run again . Yet when he moved , it was toward the house . It was as though , as soon as he found that his feet intended to go there , that he let go , seemed to float , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the dusk , up to the house and onto the back porch and to the door by which he would enter , that was never locked . But when he put his hand upon it , it would not open . Perhaps for the moment neither hand nor believing would believe ; he seemed to stand there , quiet , not yet thinking , watching his hand shaking the door , hearing the sound of the bolt on the inside . He turned away quietly . He was not yet raging . He went to the kitchen door . He expected that to be locked also . But he did not realise until he found that it was open , that he had wanted it to be . When he found that it was not locked it was like an insult . It was as though some enemy upon whom he had wreaked his utmost of violence and contumely stood , unscathed and unscarred , and contemplated him with a musing and insufferable contempt . When he entered the kitchen , he did not approach the door into the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the candle on the night when he first saw her . He went directly to the table where she set out his food . He did not need to see . His hands saw ; the dishes were still a little warm , thinking Set out for the nigger . For the nigger . He seemed to watch his hand as if from a distance . He watched it pick up a dish and swing it up and back and hold it there while he breathed deep and slow , intensely cogitant . He heard his voice say aloud , as if he were playing a game : " Ham , " and watched his hand swing and hurl the dish crashing into the wall , the invisible wall ,  | waiting for the crash to subside and silence to flow completely back before taking up another one . He held this dish poised , sniffing . This one required some time . " Beans or greens ? " he said . " Beans or spinach ? . . . All right . Call ' it beans . " He hurled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He raised the third dish . " Something with onions , " he said , thinking This is fun . Why did n't I think of this before ? " Woman 's muck . " He hurled it , hard and slow , hearing the crash , waiting . Now he heard something else : feet within the house , approaching the door . She 'll have the lamp this time , ' he thought thinking If I were to look now , I could see the light under the door As his hand swung up and back . Now she has almost reached the door " Potatoes , " he said at last , with judicial finality . He did not look around , even when he heard the bolt in the door and heard the door inyawn and light fell upon him where he stood with the dish poised . " Yes , it 's potatoes , " he said , in the preoccupied and oblivious tone of a child playing alone . He could both see and hear this crash . Then the light went away ; again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bolt . He had not yet looked around . He took up the next dish . " Beets , " he said . " I do nt like beets , anyhow . " The next day he went to work at the planing mill . He went to work on Friday . He had eaten nothing now since Wednesday night . He drew no pay until Saturday evening , working overtime Saturday afternoon . He ate Saturday night , in a restaurant downtown , for the first time in three days . He did not return to the house . For a time he would not even look toward it when he left or entered the cabin . At the end of six months he had worn a private path between the cabin and the mill . It ran almost stringstraight ,  | avoiding all houses , entering the woods soon and running straight and with daily increasing definition and precision , to the sawdust pile where he worked . And always , when the whisde blew at five thirty , he returned by it to the cabin , to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking the two miles back to town to eat , as if he were ashamed of the overalls . Or perhaps it was not shame , though very likely he could no more have said what it was than he could have said that it was not shame . He no longer deliberately avoided looking at the house ; neither did he deliberately look at it . For a while he believed that she would send for him . She 'll make the first sign , ' he thought . But she did not ; after a while he believed that he no longer expected it . Yet on the first time that he deliberately looked again toward the house , he felt a shocking surge and fall of blood ; then he knew that he had been afraid all the time that she would be in sight , that she had been watching him all the while with that perspicuous and still contempt ; . he felt a sensation of sweating , of having surmounted an ordeal . That 's over , ' he thought . ' I have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did see her , there was no shock . Perhaps he was prepared . Anyway , there was no shocking surge and drop of blood when he looked up , completely by chance , and saw her in the back yard , in a gray dress and the sunbonnet . He could not tell if she had been watching him or had seen him or were watching him now or not . You do nt bother me and I do nt bother you , ' he thought , thinking I dreamed it . It did n't happen . She has nothing under her clothes so that it could have happened He went to work in the spring . One evening in Septem-  | ber he returned home and entered the cabin and stopped in midstride , in complete astonishment . She was sitting on the cot , looking at him . Her head was bare . He had never seen it bare before , though he had felt in the dark the loose abandon of her hair , not yet wild , on a dark pillow . But he had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone while she watched him ; he said suddenly to himself , in the instanexing again : She 's trying to . I had expected it to have gray in it She 's trying to be a woman and she do nt know how . ' Thinking , knowing She has come to talk to me Two hours later she was still talking , they sitting side by side on the cot in the now dark cabin . She told him that she was fortyone years old and that she had been born in the house yonder and had lived there ever since . That she had never been away from Jefferson for a longer period than six months at any time and these only at wide intervals filled with homesickness for the sheer boards and nails , the earth and trees and shrubs , which composed the place which was a foreign land to her and her people ; when she spoke even now , after forty years , among the slurred consonants and the flat vowels of the land where her life had been cast , New England talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kin who had never left New Hampshire and whom she had seen perhaps three times in her life , her forty years . Sitting beside her on the dark cot while the light failed and at last her voice was without source , steady , interminable , pitched almost like the voice of a man , Christmas thought , She is like all the rest of them . Whether they are seventeen or fortyseven , when they finally come to surrender completely , it 's going to be in words . '  | Calvin Burden was the son of a minister named Nathaniel Burrington . The youngest of ten children , he ran away from home at the age of twelve , before he could write his name ( or would write it , his father believed ) on a ship . He made the voyage around the Horn to California and turned Catholic ; he lived for a year in a monastery . Ten years later he reached Missouri from the west . Three weeks after he arrived he was married , to the daughter of a family of Huguenot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the day after the wedding he said. , " I guess I had better settle down . " He began that day to settle down . The wedding celebration was still in progress , and his first step was to formally deny allegiance to the Catholic church . He did this in a saloon , insisting that every one present listen to him and state their objections ; he was a little insistent on there being objections , though there were none ; not , that is , up to the time when he was led away by friends . The next day he said that he meant it , anyhow ; that he would not belong to a church full of frogeating slaveholders . That was in Saint Louis . He bought a home there , and a year later he was a father . He said then that he had denied the Catholic church a year ago for the sake of his son 's soul ; almost as soon as the boy was born , he set about to imbue the child with the religion of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Burden cou ' . d not read the English Bible . But he had learned to read in Spanish from the priests in California , and as soon as the child could walk Burden ( he pronounced it Burden now , since he could not spell it at all and the priests had taught him to write it laboriously so with a hand more apt for a rope or a gunbutt or a knife than a pen ) began to read to the child in Spanish from the  | book which he had brought with him from California , interspersing the fine , sonorous flowing of mysticism in a foreign tongue with harsh , extemporised dissertations composed half of the bleak and bloodless logic which he remembered from his father on interminable New England Sundays , and half of immediate hellfire and tangible brimstone of which any country Methodist circuit rider would have been proud . The two of them would be alone in the room : the tall , gaunt , Nordic man , and the small , dark , vivid child who had inherited his mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the boy was about five , Burden killed a man in an argument over slavery and had to take his family and move , leave Saint Louis . He moved westward , " to get away from Democrats , " he said . The settlement to which he moved consisted of a store , a blacksmith shop , a church and two saloons . Here Burden spent much of his time talking politics and in his harsh loud voice cursing slavery and slaveholders . His reputation had come with him and he was known to carry a pistol , and his opinions were received without comment , at least . At times , especially on Saturday nights , he came home , still full of straight whiskey and the sound of his own ranting . Then he would wake his son ( the mother was dead now and there were three daughters , all with blue eyes ) with his hard hand . " I 'll learn you to hate two things , ' he would say , " or I 'll frail the tar out of you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear me ? " " Yes , " the boy would say . " I cant help but hear you . Get on to bed and let me sleep . " He was no proselyter , missionary . Save for an occasional minor episode with pistols , none of which resulted fatally ,  | he confined himself to his own blood . " Let them all go to their own benighted hell , " he said to his children . " But I 'll beat the loving God into the four of you as long as I can raise my arm . " That would be on Sunday , each Sunday when , washed and clean , the children in calico or denim , the father in his broadcloth frockcoat bulging over the pistol in his hip pocket , and the collarless plaited shirt which the oldest girl laundered each Saturday as well as the dead mother ever had , they gathered in the clean crude parlor while Burden read from the once gilt and blazoned book in that language which none of them understood . He continued to do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . The son 's name was Nathaniel . He ran away at fourteen and did not return for sixteen years , though they heard from him twice in that time by word-of-mouth messenger . The first time was from Colorado , the second time from Old Mexico . He did not say what he was doing in either place . " He was all right when I left him , " the messenger said . This was the second messenger ; it was in 1863 , and the messenger was eating breakfast in the kitchen , bolting his food with decorous celerity . The three girls , the two oldest almost grown now , were serving him , standing with II arrested dishes and softly open mouths in their full , coarse , clean dresses , about the crude table , the father sitting opposite the messenger across the table , his head propped on his single hand . The other arm he had lost two years ago while a member of a troop of partisan guerilla horse in the Kansas fighting , and his head and beard were grizzled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frockcoat still bulged behind over the butt of the heavy pistol . " He got into a little trouble , "  | the messenger said . " But he was still all right the last I heard . " " Trouble ? " the father said . " He killed a Mexican that claimed he stole his horse . You know how them Spanish are about white men , even when they do nt kill Mexicans . " The messenger drank some coffee . " But I reckon they have to be kind of strict , with the country filling up with tenderfeet and all. ? Thank you kindly , " he said , as the oldest girl slid a fresh stack of corn cakes onto his plate ; " yessum , I can reach the sweetening fine. ? Folks claim it was n't the Mexican 's horse noways . Claim the Mexican never owned no horse . But I reckon even them Spanish have got to be strict , with these Easterners already giving the West such a bad name . " The father grunted . " I 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be bound he was in it . You tell him , " he said violently , " if he lets them yellowbellied priests bamboozle him , I 'll shoot him myself quick as I would a Reb . " " You tell him to come on back home , " the oldest girl said . " That 's what you tell him . " " Yessum , " the messenger said . " I 'll shore tell him . I 'm going east to Indianny for a spell . But I 'll see him soon as I get back . I 'll shore tell him . Oh , yes ; I nigh forgot . He said to tell you the woman and kid was fine . " " Whose woman and kid ? " the father said . " His , " the messenger said . " I thank you kindly again . And good-bye all . " They heard from the son a third time before they saw him again . They heard him shouting one day out in front of the house , though still some distance away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a hundred miles further west , and it had taken the son two months to find them ,  | riding back and forth across Kansas and Missouri in a buckboard with two leather sacks of gold dust and minted coins and crude jewels thrown under the seat like a pair of old shoes , before he found the sod cabin and drove up to it , shouting . Sitting in a chair before the cabin door was a man . " There 's father , " Nathaniel said to the woman on the buckboard seat beside him . " See ? " Though the father was only in his late fifties , his sight had begun to fail . He did not distinguish his son 's face until the buckboard had stopped and the sisters had billowed shrieking through the door . Then Calvin rose ; he gave a long , booming shout . " Well , " Nathaniel said ; " here we are . " Calvin was not speaking sentences at all . He was just yelling , cursing . " I 'm going to frail the tar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Vangie ! Beck ! Sarah ! " The sisters had already emerged . They seemed to boil through the door in their full skirts like balloons on a torrent , with shrill cries , above which the father 's voice boomed and roared . His coat  --  the frockcoat of Sunday or the wealthy or the retired ? was open now and he was tugging at something near his waist with the same gesture and attitude with which he might be drawing the pistol . But he was merely dragging from about his waist with his single hand a leather strap , and flourishing it he now thrust and shoved through the shrill and birdlike hovering of the women . " I 'll learn you yet ! " he roared . " I 'll learn you to run away ! " The strap fell twice across Nathaniel 's shoulders . It fell twice before the two men locked . It was in play , in a sense : a kind of deadly play and smiling seriousness : the play of two lions that might or might not leave marks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and breast to breast they stood : the old man  | with his gaunt , grizzled face and his pale New England eyes , and the young one who bore no resemblance to him at all , with his beaked nose and his white teeth smiling . " Stop it , " Nathaniel said . " Do nt you see who 's watching yonder in the buckboard ? " They had none of them looked at the buckboard until now . Sitting on the seat was a woman and a boy of about twelve . The father looked once at the woman ; he did not even need to see the boy . He just looked at the woman , his jaw slacked as if he had seen a ghost . " Evangeline ! " he said . She looked enough like his dead wife to have been her sister . The boy who could hardly remember his mother at all , had taken for wife a woman who looked almost exactly like her . " That 's Juana , " he said . " That 's Calvin with her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night , with the woman and child in bed , Nathaniel told them . They sat about the lamp : the father , the sisters , the returned son . There were no ministers out there where he had been , he explained ; just priests and Catholics . " So when we found that the chico was on the way , she begun to talk about a priest . But I was n't going to have any Burden born a heathen . So I begun to look around , to humor her . But first one thing and then another come up and I could n't get away to meet a minister ; and then the boy came and so it was n't any rush anymore . But she kept on worrying , about priests and such , and so in a couple of years I heard how there was to be a white minister in Santa Fe on a certain day . So we packed up and started out and got to Santa Fe just in time to see the dust of the stage that was carrying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple more years we
