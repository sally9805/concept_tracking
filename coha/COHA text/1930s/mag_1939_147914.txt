An adventurous aviator is debonair , swashbuckling Colonel Hubert Fauntleroy Julian , the Black Eagle of Harlem . In the course of his Icarian career he has attempted a transatlantic flight , served in a black Emperor 's air corps , planned an expedition to China to fight the Japanese . <P> The transatlantic flight ended in Flushing Bay a few minutes after the takeoff ; he cracked up Haile Selassie 's own plane ; he never got to China because he collapsed in a hotel chair , broke his arm . Last week Colonel Julian made his altitude record : he flew to the defense of Father Divine himself . <P> In the little black Father 's well-heeled heavens an altercation had begun to sputter like a fish fry . What started it was a love feast ten long years ago . In 1929 Mrs. Verinda Brown had sat down at the paradisal table set by Father Divine with chicken , ham , potatoes , rice , corn , cabbage , scalloped tomatoes , hominy , carrots , beets , a two-foot cheese , five different kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as big as automobile tires . " After three hours , she rose and cried : " I feel different than when I came . " <P> Enlarged , enriched by this experience , she and her butler husband became angels , contributed all their savings to the Divine treasury , said she . Later , 54-year-old Mrs. Brown began to feel different again . Into court last week she marched to confront an inscrutable little Father Divine . He might be God to thousands of Negroes and white people , but he was God no longer to disgruntled Mrs. Brown . She wanted her money back . So did some others she represented . Mrs. Brown began to testify . At that moment the Black Eagle swooped from Harlem . <P> Dressed in a faultless blue suit with a white carnation in his buttonhole , pearl spats and ascot tie , he strode into court , announced thai ! he had come to settle the whole affair by paying out of his own pocket Mrs. Brown 's $6,500 claim , her $6,000 lawyer 's fee . A gratifying uproar filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conference room , summoned lawyers , Father Divine , and Colonel Julian . Reason for his offer : he wanted to restore peace . He haughtily produced a sheaf of warehouse receipts , replied with Oxonian accent : " I own more than $800,000 worth of aged whiskey . I am an adventurer . Within a few days I can raise $50,000 or $60,000 . I 've spent that much money in two or three weeks on a pleasure cruise . " <P> Between conference chamber and court room the colonel bustled , snapping his fingers in summons , beckoning , bowing , whispering , glaring through his monocle . Once he emerged from conference with the air of a man whose adventurous patience is exhausted . Ostentatiously he tore up a typewritten sheet , announced for all to hear : " I 'm all washed up . " Back he went , however , to the conference room , like the leader of a forlorn hope . At last , after two days , peace seemed to be assured . Justice Dineen adjourned court and his decision until next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
