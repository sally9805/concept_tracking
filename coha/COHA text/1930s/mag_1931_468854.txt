But each of us was an only child , and of course we wanted a family . We believed that brothers and sisters were the finest gifts which parents could make to their first-born . The children of my friends in France and England were restrained and made presentable by efficient " Nanas " ; and I dimly recollected a frilled and ordered childhood of my own under the patient care of an adored Irish Nellie . I had not known childhood in the rough . True , I had spent one or two harrowing days in small suburban houses on this side of the Atlantic and a few painful afternoons in apartments where whining and incessant children seemed literally to swarm . But I attributed this to mismanagement , to bad training , to lack of breeding ? to anything and everything except to the maternal exhaustion and discouragement which were really responsible . I had never considered a nurseless nursery . Then , too , my husband and I , with an innocence and simplicity which seems incredible in two moderately mature and sophisticated people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parenthood . We were told that with each child there sprang into being an inexhaustible fount of love which contained all the elements of perfect patience and unselfishness : that there was no home possible without children ; that childless women were invariably unhappy , lonely , and frustrated ; that a normal woman found perfect pleasure and a fully rounded life in the society of her young ; that a man and woman were drawn infinitely closer together by the clinging of tiny hands and the prattle of childish voices . And , finally , we were told again and again that these helpless . little beings repaid a hundredfold any small sacrifice it might be necessary to make for them . At that time we knew very few young parents , and so it was that we sum moned the stork with real lightness of heart and a thrilling feeling of anticipation . Then in the next few years the dratted bird , with utter insensitiveness to any lack of welcome on our part , became a fairly regular visitor . And:in those years I learned the truth about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country where both the cost and the standards of living are not only high but inflated . My private opinion on the subject is that Dante should have written about this problem instead of wasting time and energy creating an imaginary inferno . My children arrived just at the time when space and servants -- -two essential commodities for the proper rearing of a family ? were practically unobtainable for any reasonable sum . This meant that I was suddenly burdened with responsibility , with a great deal of work , and with the problem , in my small and expensive apartment , of too little space . This brought into my hitherto calm life a confusion and strain which I bore very badly . The incessancy of children appalled me . I could , when I was able to afford them , get vacuum cleaners , electric washers and irons , fireless cookers , electric orange squeezers , and other short-cuts to domestic comfort . But could not mechanize my babies ; nor might I , even for a day , ignore their demands . I was , therefore , entirely at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner obtain regular relief from my job . The working people , of course , solve this problem to some extent : first , by living in those neighborhoods where rents are cheaper ; and second , by a kind of community give-and-take in this matter of caring for the children . The neighbors take turns at the movies ; sisters of high-school age look after broods of smaller children , and frequently there are elderly relatives who live sociably with the younger families and who take it for granted that they shall mother the babies when it is necessary . Wealthy people can hire governesses and nursemaids . But we unhappy middle-class women who can not pay large wages , who lie awake at night over the rent , and who hesitate to deposit two or three children with an acquaintance for the afternoon are really in a very sad state . I have a very strong sense of responsibility and , although love for my children was a gradual process , I did learn it thoroughly . I wanted to give them all that physically and mentally was necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I really wanted to enjoy them and to be happy with them . I also wanted to make home pleasant for my husband . That ambition I renounced with great regret the year my fourth baby was born . And why ? Why can I not systematize my duties of wifehood and motherhood so as to fulfill them adequately ? Why , when I am living in the midst of the very beings I most deeply and passionately love , can I not be happy ? Why can I not make them happy ? II Two excellent reasons why I can not do this are : that I am only one human being ; and that , despite Mr. Einstein 's best efforts to do something about it , the day still has only twenty-four hours . With a family of young children , even with the intermittent untrained maid to clean and wash dishes , there are meals to be ordered and cooked , diapers and other clothing to be washed and mended ; telephone and doorbell to answer , some attempt at social life to be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider . And there are children ? always , incessantly , unremittingly , unmercifully , children . Children who have to be washed and dressed and undressed andput out and taken in and answered and comforted and reproved and directed and amused , and who are so often , poor mites , at the end of a long day really bated . Also there are money worries . I live in a suburb where our income comes just between the moderate salary of the bride and groom on the right and the comfortable interest on securities of the young couple three doors away . The average family in the community consists of one or two children . With our four my husband and I run , worn and panting , on a treadmill trying to give the children even half of what they have a perfect right to expect in the sphere to which we voluntarily brought them . Clean clothes and smart shoes , " hikes , " skates , doctors , dentists , an orderly and tastefully furnished house , and all the other thousand things which make up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lots of it . Although we have , of necessity , steeled ourselves to endure the wondering pity of our friends and possess neither radio , car , nor ten-dollar bottles of " great stuff just off the ship " : although my husband denies himself clubs and cigars and decent lunches and almost everything else he wants ; and I am , without exception , the worst dressed young woman know , still both ends gap wide each month , and we are struggling under a moderate load of debt , no part of which was contracted for luxuries . Nor is it a solution to go simple ; to move across the tracks ; to substitute a bandanna for a collar and a lunch pail for the cafeteria which my husband frequents . It would mean at best a shifting of nervous strains ; since in such an environment we should all be lonely and badly adjusted . Also , there would soon be no income , because my husband 's business success depends , to a large extent , upon our social contacts . We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be within commuting distance of New York and my husband 's office . I frankly admit that I am a bad servant . If I were stoutly built and loved my mop and pail ; if books and the outdoors and contact with the world meant nothing in my life ; if I could contentedly fold my work-worn hands upon a shortened lap at night and brood serenely upon the biscuits rising in the pan , we should , no doubt , all be better off . But I detest the composite drudgery so prettily known as " home making . " Activities with broom or stove or washboard do not interest me . I am one who can see grapes hanging on the vine or peaches warmly luscious upon a tree and revel in their beauty without ever once even mentally associating them with glass jars , paraffin , and boiling sugar . I love old furniture and brasses , but polishing them appeals to me exactly as much as washing a car in a garage would appeal to my husband . Nothing bores me much more than reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two sunny morning hours to the preparation of revolting raw meat , grimy vegetables , and a stuffy and wholesome milk pudding makes me shrewish . I take my sleep seriously , too . Eight or nine consecutive hours of it are necessary to me if I am to be an efficient citizen . To affect my disposition fundamentally it requires but very few nights of rising from a warm bed to distribute drinks of water , to allow a feverish and pathetic last-born desperately to cut teeth upon my collarbone , or to say soothingly , " There is no tiger there , darling . It was only a dream . For heaven 's sake stop that noise , you 'll wake the baby ! " Now if I were the only woman ? or even one woman in a hundred ? who felt this way , while all the others sangover their dishpans and beamed with delight upon their little broods , I should sadly accept the fact there was something abnormal and deficient in my make-up and say no more about it . But I ask searching questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I use my eyes and ears at the homes of acquaintances , and what do I find ? I discover numbers and numbers of attractive young women who go dully or protestingly through their days , bitterly resenting the too heavy burden motherhood is to them . I meet by the dozen , it seems to me , women in the middle or late thirties who tell me with tears in their eyes and voices that , having given up long years , sometimes health , and always personal preferences for their children , they now find themselves at cross-purposes with the adolescent sons and daughters who have taken from them everything they valued . We all know that there is a mental hygiene of childhood and that there are helpful and inspiring books on the subject . But how many of us have time to read and assimilate them , or , having read them , have the energy , mental and physical , consistently to apply the theories they contain ? And what has been the effect of all this upon the young women of to-day who have hopefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I maintain that , compared with the frustrations of the average young mother , the neuroses of thwarted spinsters are as mere surface irritations . I have , for example , one friend who married ? at twenty-five ? a widower with three young children . She is an English girl , eldest of a large family . They lived in an adequately staffed country house ; and their family relations , not being cluttered up and ohTHIS BUSINESS structed with every hard and uninteresting job on earth , were stimulating and harmonious . Kathleen learned early to adore children . They were to her actually flowerlike and lovely . She found their development fascinating , their playing the greatest possible fun , their naughtinesses endearing and amusing . She herself was a pretty thing , small and fine . She played the piano beautifully ; she was a natural landscape gardener ; she had an alert and sensitive mind and a charming gift of gaiety . She and her husband came to America . His salary from the English point of view was a generous one , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pathetically she found herself in the midst of four or five full-time jobs for no one of which she had either training or native ability . They could afford only one inadequate servant . For weeks on end they had n't even that . Her husband was a professional man , and there were appearances to be kept up . There was entertaining to be done . She tackled the proposition with amazing courage and good will . But she was helpless and bewildered . Day after day she worked and worried and did badly , with an infinite effort , a thousand tasks she hated ; and one by one she had to give up the things she did well , which were the things for which her husband first had loved her , and which would have been incomparable gifts to her family . I have never heard her complain , but I have seen all the sweetness and brilliance and talent which were Kathleen 's die before my eyes . At thirty-five she is worn and depleted , with taut nerves and an uneven temper . She loves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without joy . The community has exchanged an able musician , a gifted teacher and entertainer of children , an accomplished hostess and a well-read and well-informed citizen for a very poor seullerymaid , nurse , and general houseworker . One could multiply these cases indefinitely . There is the girl I know who , as her husband is an underpaid member of a university staff , has permitted herself only one child ; but as they can afford no help at all , is ? like a duck with its duckling never for one moment free from this solitary infant . She is the type of woman who requires long hours of solitude to be at her interesting best , and this continued imprisonment is slowly warping her nature into strange and unpleasant psychological shapes . There is the relative of mine who adores her three little sons but who has broken down physically with the labor involved in making her husband 's salary meet their needs . There are hundreds and hundreds of these perfectly wholesome women who are hating the relation which should be one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , more than anything else these years have brought rue resentment ? and continued and stifled resentment is an acid which curdles the cream of any nature . Vanity is no doubt a surface trait , but the selfrespect with which it is intimately connected is a fundamental quality . There are large rents in mine from always looking my worst . I am no Helen of Troy , but dressing and grooming help ; and it is a continual pricking annoyance to have just four children and the lack of a few dollars keep me from looking at least as well as the average woman of my age . I am still young , but to feel the years slipping drably by and to be able to do nothing about them except to minister inadequately to the physical needs of five persons oppresses me . I have never longed for a steam yacht or yearned to fling a bomb at those more generously endowed with material benefits . But it angers me beyond words to have to be blue and sleepless over the dairy and grocer 's bills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation on my son perfectly within his rights when he writes me a discourteous letter over the unavoidable length of time I am taking to pay his reasonable bill . The situation controls even my thoughts . While I once had ideas and ambitions , I now reflect almost exclusively upon the pressing necessity of getting some more money somewhere at once . While my husband and I used to study and read together ; while I used to help him with his work ; while we used to have interesting and stimulating discussions , our conversation now consists almost entirely of how much shall we pay off on this bill or that , and how are we , either of us , going to get a winter coat ; and will one of us please look and see if it 's possible that that 's another cavity in that left-hand downstairs molar . I used to be a sociable person . But having a family has made me afraid of my neighbors . I can not afford fencing for the garden , so sooner or later when the maid is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will probably make hay in Mrs. Anstruther 's tulips . If my oldest son breaks three windows in Mrs. Jones 's garage it will almost inevitably come at a time when I simply can not offer to have the panes reset . So I must bow my head before her righteous wrath . There are weeks when I ca n't keep up with the children 's legitimate and changing needs for constructive toys and tools ; and the younger members will then probably amuse themselves in various harmful ways at the expense probably of the least sympathetic person on the block . And in this connection I must say that there are few immediate neighbors in smart suburbs who , in spite of all their fair words about children , have much real sympathy or helpfulness to offer a struggling young mother . For instance , the lady who lives in the next house to mine took the time when I was snatching half an hour 's rest after a peculiarly trying night and morning to call me to the front door and tell me indignantly that my son was saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the wealthy young woman from across the way came just as I was trying to answer the telephone , cook dinner , and soothe my oldest daughter , to confide to me how ruined her afternoon had been by the sight of my year-old baby having a sunbath in shameless nudity upon the front porch . Also , one night as one of the children was indulging in a particularly agonizing fit of tummy-ache following an illegal orgy of green apples , a dear old lady two doors beyond telephoned to say that we simply must stop the child 's crying . It was evidently her impression that it was our idea of a pleasant evening 's entertainment . And I admit that even during my sincere apologies to the three it crossed my mind that the first lady might have withdrawn from fouryear-old repartee , that the second could have looked the other way , and that the third might have used a modicum of common sense before reproaching me . Iv I do not wish to give the impression that I have surrendered without a struggle to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , measles , whooping cough , and mumps . I held down a part-time job until my maid left , and I had to give it up just as it was getting interesting . I plot and sneak and lie to achieve half hours in which to read even when I am so tired I ca n't understand what I am reading . Two or three times a week I am serene enough to use logic and intelligence in bringing up my children . After two nights ' sleep I get flashes of the delight those same children and I might be to each other if we were allowed . I entertain firmly , even when I am so stupid with fatigue that no one has a good time . And I use ten-cent-store perfume , the worst cold cream on earth , and do setting-up exercises two or three times a month , when I can find time and energy ; so that if eventually I lose my husband 's love no one may say I made no effort to retain my charms . But always and always and always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never he permitted to exist in the world : I love my children to distraction ; I would not lose them for all the good things on earth ? bid if they had never come I should be far happier , far more efficient , and materially far , far better off . And in contrast to the happy mothers , what is happening to the starved , frustrated , tragic , childless women who are presumably consumed with gnawing envy of us ? Well , I go to see one couple whose income is about the same as ours . They have a lovely little country house , artistically and completely furnished . The wife has an interesting job . She is smartly dressed , slender , and looks ten years younger than her age . They have no debts ; they have a decent reserve in the bank , and a few modest investments . They can afford hooks and magazines , a reasonable cultural background , and they thoroughly enjoy each other . I go to tea with a woman who lost her only baby fifteen years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartbroken as she was at the time , she has since thanked heaven that she has not been tied down nor had to struggle as her friends have had to do . A successful and charming young friend of mine , twelve years married , tells me frankly that at no time has she ever had the faintest desire to change her freedom , and her success , for the confusions and sacrifices of a family . She adds only , " Of course , if things were different here . . . " Another friend says honestly , " Nly dear , I think you must be feebleminded to bring four complications into your life ! " It is true , of course , that probably these women in the long run would have been physically better off if each had had a child or two . It is equally true that they might gain spiritual and mental assets , like tenderness and sympathy and tolerance , if they were mothers . It is certain that they would have loved their children devotedly had they had them ; and love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions are to-day , they are happier , more comfortable , and in many cases more useful as they are . This may be a deplorably selfish attitude . There may be women who have such a sense of responsibility and duty toward the race that they are willing to give up everything which means life to them just to increase its numbers . There may be such women , but I am not one of them , and I have never met one . Also , although I hear on all sides how womanly and thrilling it is to do household tasks , I have yet to hear anyone say : " What a manly , happy man Doctor Brown is ! Never content unless he 's sifting ashes or shovelling snow . " Or , " How fully developed is dear Professor Jones . He carried fourteen hods of coal yesterday for the living-room fire , and he can hardly bear to leave the woodchopping long enough to go to the office . " Or again , " Mr. Smith is a truly fine man . Just a natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have left until almost the last . That is the effect of the discontented , overburdened , worried mother upon the children . More than anything on earth children need a serene and stable foundation for their universe . The mother must supply that foundation even as she must , for all the early helpless years , be the universe itself . And how can any woman give serenity to her children when she is nervous and anxious and tired-out herself ? My oldest girl is unkind to the younger children simply because they have become associated in her mind with a mother who , nine times out of ten , has to care for a baby just when Mary most needs sympathy and attention . One of my boys lacks good study habits because I have not had the time or the energy consistently to help and direct him . One of my little girls is negative and disobedient because I have been irritable and inconsistent in my discipline . Yet the fatigue and the nervousness which are responsible for my attitude have been beyond my power to control . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure to me , but a continuous and too difficult job . Once I have done the necessary things for them , my usual desire is to escape from them , so that they have heard day aftee ikty , " Run away and play , darling , mother wants to rest . " " Please do n't bother me now , I 'm busy . " " Yes , take what you want , but leave me alone for half an hour ! " instead of having the games and talks and agreeable and constructive contacts which should be an important part of their home life . I am not naturally cruel , but when even the noise of ordinary playing is a last straw and I am preoccupied and driven , I know that I am frequently unjust ? with resulting sulkiness and bewilderment on the part of the family . It is heartbreaking to realize that not only in spite of giving up everything for them , but because I have had to do so , I am actually hurting my children . There is the material aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard on children as on their elders . My little girl came back from school crying because her desk-mate had said to her , " Your mother must be poor . You never have nice clothes , do you ? " At seven one does not readily assimilate the idea that externals are unimportant , and the episode was responsible for the beginnings of a selfconsciousness which it is now difficult to eliminate . The small critic was an only child whose parents had no larger income than ours but who were able , obviously , to do more with it . My oldest son for a long time much wanted a bicycle . With a good deal of effort we managed to buy him a secondhand one . When it came home he actually cried with pleasure and excitement . He started off to school the next morning full of joy and pride . At noon he came back to me utterly crestfallen . Several children had laughed at his treasure and had pointed out that it was not new at all but had rust on the handle bars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suggested that since he had the bicycle and could enjoy riding it it was not very important what other people thought about it . But although he agreed with us , his first joy in the bicycle had gone and it has never returned . Possibly one or two incidents of this kind do not matter much . But when they occur frequently , as they have in our family , they are apt to cause a feeling of inferiority which is really detrimental to a child 's social life . I do not feel that I know my children at all . It seems to me that I am seeing them from a great distance . I should like to have leisure to spend a great deal of time with them . I should love to read with my oldest girl , to take her out with me more , to be able to afford concerts for her and the better children 's plays . My oldest son has a great aptitude in the use of tools and shows tremendous interest in machinery . It would give me pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his and to have time to encourage and direct him when he finds it difficult to finish the task he has started . It would be valuable to my obstinate younger daughter if I had time and tranquillity patiently to find out just why she is so antagonistic and help her to eliminate or control it . I have a knack of story-telling which we should all enjoy . And I think picnics and walks combined with a certain amount of nature study are a lot of fun . But I have too much to do . Too much to worry over , too many difficult adjustments to make ; and I am too tired to have time for the realities of life . And those of my friends who are trying to bring up a family are in the same position . I have painted a very dark picture . It is impossible to do otherwise when one of the most important of human relations is so shadowed by unhappiness . But I do not think it need always be so dark . It seems to me that since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to have children , the community will have to help them to do so happily and constructively . The visiting mother 's helper might be one solution to this problem . She would have to have a certain amount of training , preferably a course in high school ; but she would presumably divide her time between several families so that each mother 's share of her wages would not be prohibitive . Community kitchens have been suggested . Reasonably priced nursery schools are another possibility . There could be more co-operation between the mothers in small towns and suburbs , more sharing of burdens . The standards of living will doubtless have to be lowered . One individual can not make herself and her family entirely different from the people around them , and achieve anything by doing so except humiliation . But a group of people could simplify life for themselves , with comparative ease . Such a group would have to decide just what were the essential things for the happiness and best good of the family , and ruthlessly eliminate the waxed floors , finger bowls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were left over . And most of all the young women who wish to have children must know truthfully and exactly what they are undertaking . They must be told that mother love has an ugly side called hate ; that it is all wrong for a mother and her children to he always together . That patience is more a question of sufficient sleep than of affection . That for every sweet and rewarding moment a child gives you there are ten of boredom , irritation , or self-sacrifice . They must face the fact that when they bear children they are bringing into their homes individualities who need space and harmony in which to develop , and that if they are to be happy themselves and are to make their children happy they will have to be sure of some release from their job ? some way of living which they can afford without undue worry , and leisure really to know their families . And when all this comes to pass I shall weep , because I shall be too 014 by that time to have four @ @ @
