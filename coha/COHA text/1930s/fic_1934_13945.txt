The scene of the entire play is the lunch room of the Black Mesa Filling Station and Bar-B-Q on the desert in Eastern Arizona . There is an atmosphere about the place of strenuous if not hearty welcome . At the upper right are double doors , with glass panels leading out to a covered porch . Off to the right , barely visible through these doors , are the red pumps of the filling station . Down-stage left is a door leading to the bedrooms of the MAPLE family who own this establishment . Up-stage left is a swinging door leading to the kitchen . Up-stage is a lunch counter , with cash register , ketchup bottles , paper napkins , toothpicks , chewing gum and Life-Saver rack , cigars , cigarettes , etc . In the right wall are wide windows , through which may be seen the porch and , beyond it , the desert purpling in the sunset . At the left is a stove , with a high-backed rocking chair beside it . There are three small , square tables  --  down-stage left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs at each table . At the right , along the wall , is a wooden bench . The walls are of phoney adobe . The window and door-trimmings are painted a dark , burnt red . Above the windows is a sign , with the words " BLACK MESA BAR-B-Q " worked in rustic letters . This formerly hung outside , but was replaced by a neon sign , the green gleam of which will be evident later on when darkness descends . The walls are decorated with advertisements of Rye Whisky , Gas and Oil , the NRA , the TWA , the Red Cross , the American Legion , the Santa F R. R. , Apache Beer , etc . On the wall are a framed photograph of General Pershing and below it an old service flag with one star . Prominently displayed is a crudely lettered sign that shouts : " TIPPING IS UN-AMERICAN  --  KEEP YOUR CHANGE ! " At the table down-stage right are two TELEGRAPH LINEMEN , eating hamburger and drinking coffee . Both are young . The FIRST is thin and explosive in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and drawn back from the table , sits BOZE HERTZLINGER , a stalwart , bronzed young man , who wears dirty white canvas pants and a filthy football jersey , on the back of which is a patch with the number 42 . He is lighting a cigarette . At the left , in the rocking chair , sits GRAMP MAPLE  --  an old , old man . His eyes are watery and his vision blurred . His skin is like leather that has been dried by a lifetime under the desert sun and worn thin by constant rough usage . He holds a tattered pink copy of the Denver Post , but he is paying more attention to the talk of the LINEMEN than to the screaming headlines . FIRST LINEMAN swallowing . Certainly it 's Revolution ! And that 's exactly what we got to come to , whether a lot of old fluffs back east like it or not p. 3 SECOND LINEMAN Yeah  --  and when it comes  --  how are you going to FIRST LINEMAN When it comes , we 're going to finally get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Independence . SECOND LINEMAN Equality  --  hell ! It 's slavery . And how will you like that ? FIRST LINEMAN What have we got now , I 'd like to know ? Do you call this freedom ? He stows more food into his nimble mouth BOZE Listen to me , kid . In school we had to read up a lot on that cockeyed system they got in Russia  --  and I 'm here to tell you that if you were living over there you would n't be able to call your soul your own . FIRST LINEMAN And how do I know I 've got a soul ? BOZE You 're alive , are n't you ? FIRST LINEMAN Oh , sure  --  I 'm alive . I got a heart  --  I can hear it beating . I got a stomach  --  I can hear it growling . I got blood  --  I can see it , when I stick myself with one of them goddam splinters . But where 's this soul that everybody hollers about ?

JASON MAPLE has come in from the upper right . He is a dull , defeated man , of about forty , solemn , bespectacled , paunchy . He wears a gray alpaca cap , and a gray suit . In his lapel is an American Legion button JASON to BOZE . Lady wants five gallons . Get going . BOZE O. K. boss . He pinches out the coal of his cigarette and places the butt behind his ear JASON And you better keep on the alert out there so 's customers do n't have to wait . See ? BOZE O. K. boss . He goes out . The FIRST LINEMAN laughs FIRST LINEMAN And there 's the guy who 's here to tell me that in Russia you ca n't even call your soul your own . JASON You fellers want pie ?

That 's the kind of liberty we 've been getting . p. 5 JASON through the door at the left . A couple of pies . He goes to the coffee boiler on the counter to refill the two cups SECOND LINEMAN What are you complaining about ? You 're eating . FIRST LINEMAN significantly . " Man can not live by bread alone . " SECOND LINEMAN Who says he ca n't ? FIRST LINEMAN God says so ! That 's who . SECOND LINEMAN Oh  --  is God a Russian ? FIRST LINEMAN He certainly ai n't with the Postal Telegraph . PAULA , the Mexican cook , comes in , bearing the pie . JASON lights a cigar JASON Take these . JASON gives the cups to PAULA as she passes FIRST LINEMAN Why do you suppose it is that Russia 's got the whole world scared ? It 's because they 're pushing ahead . They 're pioneering ! GRAMP They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pioneering . They 're opening up new territory  --  and for the benefit of all , not so 's a few land grabbers can step in and take the profits after somebody else has done the real work . Graecias . This is addressed to PAULA , who has delivered the pie and is now removing the remnants of the hamburgerThose engineers in Russia are building something new ! That 's where they 've got it on us . We ai n't building  --  we 're repairing . Just like you and me . What do we do  --  day after day ? We climb up poles , and fix the wires , so that some broker in New York can telegraph in a split second to some guy in Los Angeles to tell him he 's ruined . p. 6 GRAMP Well , my friend  --  when you talk about pioneering  --  you 're talking about something I can tell you a few things about , He has risen and is crossing to occupy the chair vacated by BOZE JASON Shut up , Gramp . GRAMP I wo n't shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguments with the guests . GRAMP Listen  --  I can tell these boys some things they 'd be glad to hear . Would n't you , boys ? SECOND LINEMAN Sure ! Go ahead , Pop . Change the subject . Both LINEMEN are devouring the pie GRAMP Listen , my friend . I come down into this desert fifty-six years ago . I come down from Virginia City by way of Salt Lake and Mesa Verde . You had to be tough to cross this country in them days  --  Piyutes  --  Apaches  --  and plenty of white men with no love for their neighbors . Yes , sir ! I was in your same line of business  --  wire stringing . I helped string the first line that run west out of Albuquerque , and we had one hell of a time doing it , too . BOZE comes in BOZE Lady wants a pack of Camels . p. 7 GRAMP Do you want to know who was the Governor of this territory in them days ? Well , I 'll tell you . General Lew Wallace . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Santa F. He was a brave man and he had to be , because governing around here was dangerous work . It meant killing or being killed . BOZE Ataboy , Mr. Maple . Tell em about the time you took a shot at Bill the Kid . JASON hands BOZE the Camels and the change GRAMP I did n't take no shots at the Kid . I had too goddam much sense . But he took a couple at me . I 'm practically the only man he ever missed ; but he was only doing it in fun , so it could n't hardly count . GABBY MAPLE comes in from the left on the cue " he ever missed . " She is young and pretty , with a certain amount of style about her . Her principal distinguishing feature is an odd look of resentment in her large , dark eyes . She carries a thin book , her forefinger marking the place . She sits down at the table at the left and starts to read JASON Get on out with those Comels . BOZE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing look at GABBY , which the ignores FIRST LINEMAN Well , Pop , it 's been very interesting , but I 've got to be p. 8 GRAMP Wait a minute . I was just going to tell you about the first message we over sent over that line . General Wallace dictated it and we sent it all the way through to Washington to President Hayes . And do you want to know what it said ? It said , " God Save the Republic ! " That 's what General Wallace told us to say  --  and he was a great author . FIRST LINEMAN who has risen . You better send that same message through again , Pop  --  because the old republic 's badly in need of assistance . How much do we owe ? He has crossed to the lunch counter , the SECOND LINEMAN following JASON That 'll be fifty-five cents apiece . GABBY What did they have ? JASON Hamburger special , pie , and two cups of coffee . GABBY All right . She puts down the book and picks up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen at the left . The LINEMEN are paying at the counter GRAMP Hope you 'll call in again , boys . I always enjoy talking to anybody in the telegraphing business . SECOND LINEMAN Maybe we will , Pop . Never can tell where we 'll be sent next . p. 9 GRAMP That 's right  --  you ca n't . JASON as he shoves change across the counter . There 's just one remark I 'd like to pass to you , brother . Just watch out how you talk about the United States of America . FIRST LINEMAN What do you mean ? JASON I mean simply this : belittling our system of government , preaching revolution and destruction , and red propaganda  --  well , it is n't a very healthy occupation . That 's all . GRAMP I thought you said not to argue with the guests . JASON I 'm only telling you , brother  --  for the sake of your own good . FIRST LINEMAN So it 's unhealthy , eh ! How do you think this government was started if it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We got to get going . FIRST LINEMAN Wait till he answers my question . JASON The American Revolution was fought to establish law and order . But the object of your dirty red propaganda is to destroy it FIRST LINEMAN And how much law and order have we got ? Did you read about that massacre yesterday in Oklahoma City ? What kind of law and order is that ? p. 10 SECOND LINEMAN Listen , Nick . I got a dame waiting up for me in Gallup and I JASON If some of you Bolsheviks would quit preaching disrespect for law , it would n't be possible for criminals to FIRST LINEMAN Yeah ? Do you want to know something ? They do n't have crime in Russia . And why ? Because they 've abolished the cause of crime . They 've abolished greed ! And I 'll tell you something else SECOND LINEMAN I 'm going . He starts out JASON You got your eats and there 's your change . Now kindly get out . FIRST LINEMAN pocketing his change . O. K. Mr. Tin-horn Patriot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens . I want to see you when you 've joined the mob and started waving the red flag . He turns and starts out GRAMP ' By , boys . FIRST LINEMAN Good-by , Pop . The LINEMEN go out GRAMP You never should get into arguments with a boy like that , Jason . You only make a fool of yourself . JASON back of counter . I 'm sorry I did n't get his name , so 's I could report him . p. 11 GRAMP You tend to your own business , son , and stop fussing about other JASON with surprising vehemence . My own business ! That 's a fine thing to say to me . What business have I got ? Miserable little service station on the edge of nowheres . GRAMP It 's a living , ai n't it ? JASON A living  --  yes  --  just barely . But it 's one hell of a life for a man that ought to be getting some place in the world . GRAMP Maybe it 's all you 're good for . JASON I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you 've always thought , since I was a boy . What chance have I ever had to prove what I can do ? GRAMP You had a war , did n't you ? Biggest war yet . JASON Yes  --  and you think I failed in that because I did n't come home with a lot of medals , and some German scalps hanging on my belt . Well , they did n't hand out medals to us soldiers that drove trucks  --  even if we did get right up into the danger zone time and time again . GRAMP All right , son  --  all right You could have enlisted in the infantry if you 'd had a mind to . p. 12 JASON hotly . I enlisted in the branch of the service where my knowledge of mechanics could do the most good to my country . And I 've still got that knowledge . And you know damned well it 's your fault I do n't get more scope for using it . He has come out from behind the counter GRAMP My fault ? JASON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place when you can sell it for good money . GRAMP I do n't have to sell if i do n't want to . JASON Dana Trimble 's renewed his offer . Seven thousand dollars , and I know I can get him up to nine , maybe ten . GRAMP What makes him think this property 's worth that much ? JASON He knows perfectly well they 're going to make this an interstate highway and run the bus route to El Paso through here . GRAMP All right  --  if it 's good for him , it 's good for us . JASON With seven thousand dollar I could buy a big piace of an Auta Camp on Redondo Boulevard in one of the best districts of Los Angeles I 'd put in a Bar-B-Q service and in couple of years we 'd have something GRAMP Los Angeles ! My God You want to go to Los Angeles and Gabby wants to go to Europe . Ain they nobody around here that 's eatis fied to stay put ? p. 13 JASON How about yourself ? Were you ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old you did n't have enough energy to move ? GRAMP Listen to me , son . In my day , we had places to go  --  new places But , my God  --  Los Angeles GABBY comes in from the kitchen GABBY Paula 's scared . GRAMP What 's she scared of ? GABBY The Mexicans are saying that Mantee is headed this way . JASON He was headed for the border and he 's over it by now  --  the Texas Rangers have n't got him . GRAMP They wo n't get him . Have you seen his picture ? Stright his hair . Got Injun blood . He 'll it ' em . JASON importantly . You ca n't for all the people all the time . He turns to soWatch the counter , will you , Gabby ? I got to get dressed . GRAMP Dressed ? For what ? JASON Legion meeting . GABBY What time will you be home , Dad ? JASON About ten , I guess  --  maybe later . There 's a lot of important husiness coming up . He addresses GRAMP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiries about those telegraph men . And if I can beat ' em , that Bolshevik will be out a job and then he can go look for work pioneering in Russia . p. 14 GABBY What 'll you do  --  blow a legle and turn the whole goddam legion loose on him ? JASON Will you kindly control your language ? GABBY I 'll talk the only language understand . GRAMP You 'll never get Gabby to talk respectable . Never in all this world . JASON Well , I only hope some day my own daughter will learn to cultivate little respect for the things I stand for . maybe the time will come when you 'll thankful your father fought for his muntry . He goes out at the left GABBY going behind the counter . what did that telegraph man say that it Dad in such a stew ? GRAMP I do n't know what he did  --  something about Russia and pionering . But there 's a lot in it , whatever it was . The trouble with his country is it 's got settled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever , and whenever anybody says , let 's get the hell out of here , " all the let start to holler , " If we move a step the Injuns 'll get us . " Well  --  say  --  we 'd been that way in my time , I 'd like to know how this country 'd ever have got rich enough to be able to support the American Legion . Two from an auto horn are heardSay ! there 's the mail . with surprising alacrity , GRAMP jumps up and hurries out . GABBY has poured herself a cup of coffee and brought it down to the table at the left . She sits down , sips the coffee , opens her book , and reads . After a moment BOZE comes in , sees that she is alone , and closes the door behind him . GABBY looks up , sees who it is , indicates indifference , and resumes reading . BOZE comes up behind her , leans over , and kisses the back of her neck . She brushes him off as though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out . BOZE grins , draws up a chair , and sits down close to her , his hefty forearms resting on the table BOZE Not mad , are you , Gabby ? GABBY Where 's Gramp ? BOZE He 's out talking to the postman . Do n't worry about him . GABBY I was n't worrying . BOZE Do n't you like me , honey sweet ? GABBY No  --  not very much . BOZE O. K. I 'll forgive you  --  seeing as I 've been here only a little while and I have n't had much chance to go into my act . But when I do  --  you 're going to change your attitude awful fast . She fails to comment on this threat . He is silent for a moment , his jaws confidently chewing on a small piece of gum . What 's that you 're reading ? GABBY You would n't like it . BOZE How do you know how I feel about things ? Can I look ? GABBY Sure . Go ahead and look . He takes the opened book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He reads " The shapely slender shoulders small , Long arms , hands wrought in gloriouswise , Round little breasts , the hips withalHigh , full of flesh , not scant of size , Fit for all amorous masteries " He whistles through his teethSay ! That 's kind of pash ! She snatches the book away from himSo that 's the kind of stuff you read . Well , honey , I 'm not a bit surprised . I 've been suspecting all along that all you needed was a little encouragement . She looks at him , curiously , with a mixture of contempt and some slight interestAnd I do n't wonder that in a Godforsaken place like this you 'd have to get it out of poetry . GABBY defensive . It 's great poetry ! BOZE Certainly it 's great . But I can think of something a whole lot better . Look at me , honey . She looks at him I 'm not so terrible looking , am I ? GABBY Why do you wear that locket around your neck ? BOZE laughing . Locket ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BOZE I 've been waiting for you to notice that . That was my father 's watch chain . My mother gave it to me when I graduated . I 'd like you to know my mother . She lives in Grants Pass , Oregon , and she could tell you some pretty nice things about me . But wait till you see what 's on the end . He draws the chain out and displays a gold footballIt 's a gold football  --  solid gold ! I got that for intercepting a pass and running sixty-eight yards for a touchdown . GABBY What was your school ? BOZE Nevada Tech . If I 'd been with Princeton or Minnesota or any of those big clubs , I 'd have been All-American . Wait till I show you something . He produces a bill-fold from his hip pocket and extracts therefrom a frequently folded clippingThat 's from Sid Ziff 's column in the Los Angeles Herald . He saw me play against Loyola . Listen to what he says : " Tip to the pigskin fraternity : When pondering your All-American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of Boze Hertzlinger of Nevada Tech . Playing with an admittedly minor league club , and protected by interference of cellophane strength , Hertzlinger managed to remind some of us observers of the Illini Phantom himself . " Do you know who the Illini Phantom was ? Red Grange ! He folds up the clipping and restores it to his pocketThat 's just a sample of the kind of notices I got . I could show you dozens more like it . p. 18 GABBY You think a hell of a lot of yourself , do n't you ? BOZE disarmingly . Who would n't , in my position ? GABBY Why do you have to work in a filling station ? BOZE Well  --  that 's a point that I do n't know if I could explain so 's you 'd understand it . I could be making good money in a lot of ways right now  --  engineering , coaching , the insurance game  --  lots of ways . But  --  I just ca n't be tied down  --  not yet . I 've got an itch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rainbow . GABBY Do you ever expect to catch it ? BOZE I 'll catch it all right . I 'll twist its tail , and make it do tricks . Maybe I 'm kind of close to it right now . GABBY You 'd better look some place else . There are n't any rainbows around Black Mesa . BOZE I would n't bet on that . You know , Gabby  --  you 're a queer kid . Sometimes you seem too young to know anything . And then  --  sometimes  --  you seem like God 's grandmother . And reading that pash poetry . That gives me an idea . GABBY An idea of what ? BOZE Oh  --  it 's easy to tell when a girl 's ready for love . p. 19 GABBY How do you tell that , Boze ? BOZE Well  --  one pretty sure way is when she starts calling me by my own name for the first time . And another way is how I feel myself . It takes two to make a radio programme , you know  --  the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And when I 'm with a girl that 's cute and appealing , with big , soft eyes  --  well  --  I can feel sort of electric waves running all through me  --  and I can be pretty sure she 's doing some broadcasting , whether she knows it or not . GABBY Have you got a programme coming in now ? BOZE Listen  --  It 's like the hottest torch song that ever was sung . Ca n't you kind of hear it , honey ? She looks away from him , but says nothing , He reaches out and takes hold of her hand , entwining his fingers with hersYou can call me a sap if you want to , Gabby  --  but I guess I 'm falling in love with you . I 'm getting so I want you more than is good for me . GABBY looking at him , levelly . Have you ever been in love before ? BOZE scornfully . No ! GABBY Have you ever said you were ? p. 20 BOZE Sure  --  plenty of times . GABBY Did they believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll tell you why : it 's because they were all dumb ! But that 's just where you 're different . I could n't fool you , Gabby . GABBY I 'm smart , am I ? BOZE Too smart  --  for most men You 'd catch on to ' em . But that 's what I want . Because the more you see into me , the better you 're going to like me . With his free hand , he take hold of her chin GABBY You 'd better look out , if you want to hold on to your job . Dad might come in and he does n't like to have the help making passes at me . BOZE That would n't bother me , honey sweet . There are plenty more jobs for any one with the ambition I 've got . But there are n't plenty more girls like you . He leans over and kisses her You 're going to love me , Gabby . You 're going to love me a lot . GABBY Look out ! There 's some one BOZE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ALAN SQUIER has appeared in the doorway , and , seeing that he has interrupted some amour , has paused to give them time to break . He is a thin , wan , vague man of about thirtyfive . He wears a brown felt hat , brown tweed coat and gray flannel trousers  --  which came originally but much too long ago from the best Savile Row tailors . He is shabby and dusty but there is about him a sort of afterglow of elegance . There is something about him  --  and it is impossible in a stage direction to say just what it is  --  that brings to mind the ugly word " condemned . " He carries a heavy walking stick and a ruck-sack is slung over his shoulders . He is diffident in manner , ultra-polite and soft spoken ; his accent is that of an Anglicized American p. 21 SQUIER Good evening . BOZE cordially . Good evening ! What can we do for you ? SQUIER Can I order something to eat ? BOZE Why , certainly . Miss Maple will take care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hat , and putting them on the bench at the right , BOZE turns to GABBY and speaks in a low toneYour father going into town ? GABBY Yes . She is taking a menu card to the table at the centre BOZE significantly . O. K. He goes out GABBY Will you sit down here , sir ? SQUIER Thanks . He sits . She hands him the menu card GABBY Driven far ? SQUIER I 've been walking . GABBY Do you live around here ? SQUIER No . My last host of the road reached his own ranch , about ten miles back , and did n't ask me in . I had to continue on foot . It 's wonderful what progress you can make just by doing this . He jerks his thumb and looks at the menu " To-day 's Special . " Just what is a Bar-B-Q ? p. 22 GABBY Well  --  here it 's hamburger sandwich with vegetables on the side . It 's always " To-day 's Special . " But it 's pretty good . SQUIER I want it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of corn soup , and some beer , and  --  I 'll order the dessert later . GABBY O. K. She takes the menu SQUIER Another question . Where am I ? GABBY This place is called Black Mesa , but there 's nothing else here . Where were you planning to go ? SQUIER My plans have been uncertain . GABBY You mean , you were just bumming along ? SQUIER Call it gipsying . I had a vague idea that I 'd like to see the Pacific Ocean , and perhaps drown in it . But that depends GABBY Where did you come from ? SQUIER Quite a long way , Miss Maple . Is that the name ? GABBY smiling . Yes  --  that 's it . Are you English ? SQUIER No . You might call me an American once removed . But  --  if you do n't mind  --  GABBY The soup 'll be right in . The washroom 's through there , on your left , if you want it . She indicates the door at the left p. 23 SQUIER Thank you . GABBY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees the book of verse , picks it up and looks at it , wonderingly . The door at the left opens and JASON comes out , resplendent in the uniform of his Legion post . It is horizon blue , with white Sam Browne belt and pistol holster . SQUIER looks at JASON with amazement JASON Good evening . SQUIER Good evening . JASON Any one take your order ? SQUIER Yes  --  a charming young lady . JASON That 's my daghter . He says this with a note of warning , as much as to add : " And do n't try to get fresh . " JASON crosses to the cash register , punches the " No Sale , " and extracts five silver dollars from the till . He then reaches under the counter , takes out a revolver , breaks it to make sure it 's loaded , and rubs it with a cloth . SQUIER has one more puzzled look at him , then goes out at the left . GRAMP comes in from the upper right , bearing a fresh copy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was just talking to Roy Greeley and he says in town they 're all certain that Mantee outfit is headed here . Look ! They got the whole story here in The Post . Oklahoma City Massacre ! Six killed  --  four wounded  --  two not expected to live . JASON glances at the paperThe sheriff 's got all his deputies out patrolling the roads . They think there 's sure going to be some killing around here . p. 24 JASON Well  --  if there is  --  we ca n't trust that sheriff to do a damn thing . We 'll turn out the Legion . GRAMP You would ? JASON Certainly ! That 's what we 're there for . He thrusts the revolver in the holster of his Sam Browne belt , goes to the kitchen door , and calls through itGabby ! GABBY Yes ? JASON I 'm leaving now . And I  --  I took five bucks . If anything delays me getting back , I 'll phone . GABBY O. K. JASON Do n't forget to light the Neon sign when it gets dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door and crosses up front of the counter GRAMP Well , by God , you 'd better not try to do any shooting in that get-up . I never seed a better target . JASON You need n't be afraid about me . GABBY comes in with the soup GRAMP I ai n't afraid . But I would be if I was you . GABBY How much did you say you took ? JASON Five bucks . p. 25 GABBY What do you need all that for ? JASON Just in case of emergency . He decides to resent all this interferenceBy God , between the two of you , you 'd think I was n't fit to be trusted with money or ideas or anything . But I 'm here to tell you , both of you GABBY putting the soup on the table . What , Dad ? JASON Oh , never mind . He goes out . GABBY goes to the counter , opens a bottle of beer , and takes it to the centre table GRAMP while she is about this . It 's too bad they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Germans . They would n't none of ' em have come home . Who 's that food for ? GABBY Customer . He 's in the washroom , I guess . GRAMP Is it that young feller that walked in with a little pack on his back ? He goes to his rocking chair at the left GABBY Yes  --  that 's the one . GRAMP Looked to me like one of them things you see up around Taos . He sits downHey , Gabby , how about letting your poor , weary old grandfather have a little drink now ? p. 26 GABBY No . GRAMP Aw  --  come on . I ai n't got so long to live . SQUIER comes in from the left GABBY You can have one before you go to bed , and that 's all . She goes out through the kitchen door GRAMP Your soup 's waiting for you , my friend . SQUIER Thank you . GRAMP Looks good , too . SQUIER Yes . It looks fine . SQUIER sits down and starts to eat , revenously . GRAMP decides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He crosses to SQUIER 'S table GRAMP Like to see a picture of that Duke Mantee ? He holds out the newspaper . SQUIER looks at the clamor ous headlines SQUIER My God ! Six killed . Did he do all that ? GRAMP Him and his friends did , when they sprung him from the law . Fine lot of sheriffs they must have there in Oklahoma City  --  letting themselves get knocked over right out in front of the Court House . SQUIER still eating . He does n't look very vicious , does he ? p. 27 GRAMP sitting down . Well  --  I 'll tell you ; you ca n't tell a killer from his picture , except by his chin . That 's a funny thing about a killer  --  always holds his chin in . Ever notice that ? SQUIER buttering some bread . I do n't think I 've ever seen a killer . GRAMP I have . Plenty of ' em . Ever hear of Billy the Kid ? SQUIER Yes , indeed . GRAMP I knowed him well , down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me , once . SQUIER I congratulate you on still being with us . GRAMP Well  --  it was kind of dark , and he 'd had a few  --  and , besides , I do n't think he really meant to do me any real harm . Just wanted to scare the pants off of me . SQUIER Did he do it ? GRAMP New  --  I seed he was just having some fun . So I said to him : " Kid  --  you 're drunk ! " And he said , " What makes you think that ? " He was always soft-spoken . And I said : " Because you missed me ! " Well , sir  --  he had to laugh . You 're kind of hongry , are n't you ? SQUIER Yes . You can go just so long without food p. 28 GRAMP Been having some bad luck ? SQUIER Yes . GRAMP Well  --  no disgrace in that these days . What line of work you in ? SQUIER None , just now . I have been , at times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a funny thing . SQUIER laughing silently . Yes  --  it is . GRAMP I knew the greatest writer that ever lived . Sam Clemens . Ever hear of him ? SQUIER trying hard to think . Let me see GRAMP Well , did you ever hear of Mark Twain ? SQUIER Oh , yes ! GRAMP Same feller ! SQUIER Really ? GABBY comes in with " To-day 's Special , " which she puts on the table GRAMP Yes , sir . I knew him when I was a boy up in Virginia City . He was writing comical pieces for the paper there  --  The Enterprise  --  and he was the best goddam liar I ever seed , and I 've seed plenty . He used to say he did his writing on the principle that his readers wanted everything but the truth , so that 's what he give ' em . GABBY is on the way outAre you a famous writer ? At the kitchen door , GABBY turns to look at SQUIER , then goes out p. 29 SQUIER No . GRAMP Maybe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alan Squier . GRAMP Well , maybe you are famous , for all I 'd know . I do n't get to do much reading , outside of the headlines . Eyes have gone back on me . But when I was your age , I could hit a running jack rabbit at fifty paces GABBY coming in . Your supper 's ready , Gramp . GRAMP And I 'm ready for it . Got me hongry , watching him eat . He has risenPleased to have met you , Mr. Squier . SQUIER Pleased to have met you , sir . GRAMP Yes , sir . Thank you , sir . He goes out GABBY Like the soup ? SQUIER from the heart . It was glorious ! GABBY Want some coffee ? SQUIER Will it mix with the beer ? GABBY Oh , sure . Coffee will mix with anything . She goes to the counter to get his coffee p. 30 SQUIER That 's a charming old gentleman . Your grandfather ? GABBY Yes . SQUIER He told me he 'd been missed by Billy the Kid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You get terribly sick of him after a while . She has brought down the coffeeDid I hear him say you 're a writer ? SQUIER humbly . Yes . GABBY I have n't met many writers  --  except Sidney Wenzell . Ever heard of him ? SQUIER That 's not Mark Twain , is it ? GABBY No ! Sidney Wenzell  --  he 's with Warner Brothers . He stopped here once , when he was driving out to the Coast . He said I ought to go to Hollywood , and to be sure and look him up . But  --  what the hell . They never mean it . SQUIER No ! They never mean a thing . She has picked up her book and started to goPlease do n't go . She pauses and turns GABBY Something else you want ? We got pie and layer cake . SQUIER No . I  --  I 'd like to talk to you . Please sit down . p. 31 GABBY All right . She sits down , across from him , at the centre table . SQUIER eats rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food away as he talks and listens SQUIER I suppose you want to go into the movies ? GABBY scornfully . God , no ! SQUIER But  --  I thought every beautiful girl had her heart set on Hollywood . GABBY That 's just it . It 's too common . I want to go to Bourges . She fails to soften the " G " SQUIER Where ? GABBY Bourges  --  in France . You 'd never guess it , but that 's where I came from . SQUIER You 're not French ? GABBY Partly . I was born in Bourges  --  but I left it almost before I was able to walk , so all I know about it is from the picture postcards my mother sends me . They got a cathedral there . SQUIER Your mother still lives there ? GABBY Yes . Dad brought us back here after the war . Mother stuck it out in this desert for a couple of years , and then she packed up and went back to Bourges . We 've never seen her since . Some people seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But what could she do ? She did n't have any money to bring me up . She just could n't live here  --  and you ca n't blame her for that . Do you think she was cruel ? p. 32 SQUIER Not if you do n't , Miss Maple . GABBY Well  --  I do n't . She 's tried lots of times to get me over there to see her  --  but Dad wo n't allow it . She got a divorce and married a Frenchman that 's got a bookstore . Mother was always a great reader , so I guess it 's nice for her . She 's got three more kids . Just think of that ! I 've got a half-brother and half-sisters that ca n't speak a word of English . I 'd sure like to see them . SQUIER Can you speak French ? GABBY Only what you learn in high school  --  like table for " table . " She takes a photograph from the bookLook  --  there 's my mother 's picture . That was just before she married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SQUIER She 's lovely ! And I can see the resemblance . GABBY It 's hard to imagine her being married to Dad , is n't it ? But I guess he looked all right in his American uniform . Mother used to send me a book every year for my birthday , but they were all in French and I could n't read them . So last year I wrote and asked if she 'd mind sending me one in English , and she sent me this one . It 's the " Poems of Franois Villon . " Ever read it ? SQUIER Yes . p. 33 GABBY It 's wonderful poetry . She wrote in it : " ma chre petite Gabrielle . " That means " To my dear little Gabrielle . " She gave me that name . It 's about the only French thing I 've got . SQUIER Gabrielle . It 's a beautiful name . GABBY Would n't you know it would get changed into " Gabby " by these ignorant bastards around here ? I guess you think I use terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's picturesque . GABBY Well  --  it suits this kind of country . SQUIER You share your mother 's opinion of the desert ? She nodsBut you can find solace in the " Poems of Franois Villon . " GABBY Yes . They get the stink of the gasoline and the hamburger out of my system . SQUIER Would you like to read me one of those poems , Gabrielle ? GABBY You mean now ? SQUIER Yes . While I 'm finishing " To-day 's Special . " GABBY O. K. I 'll read you the one I like best . He wrote it about a friend of his who was getting married . She reads , with marked but inexpert emphasis " At daybreak , when the falcon clapshis wingsNo whit for grief , but noble heartheld highWith loud glad noise he stirs himself andsprings , And takes his meat and toward hislure draws nigh ; Such good I wish you ! Yea , andheartilyI 'm fired with hope of true love 's meedto get ; Knowing Love writes it in his book ; for why , This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ever see a falcon ? p. 34 SQUIER Yes . GABBY What does it look like ? SQUIER Not very pleasant . Like hawk . Go on , Gabrielle . GABBY resuming reading . " Mine own heart 's lady with no gainsayingsYou shall be always till I die ; And in my right against all bitter thingsSweet laurel with fresh rose its forceshall try ; Seeing reason wills not that I castlove byNor here with reason shall I chide andfret She closes the book and recitesNor cease to serve , but serve moreconstantly ; This is the end for which we twain aremet . " She looks at him , and he at her . Then he resumes his attack on the hamburgerYou know  --  that 's wonderful stuff . But that 's the way the French people are : they can understand everything  --  like life , and love  --  and death  --  and they can enjoy it , or laugh at it , depending on how they feel . SQUIER And that 's why you want to go to France  --  for understanding . GABBY I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this place . Dad 's going to take his share and move to Los Angeles , so that he can join a really big Legion post and get to be a political power . But I 'm going to spend my part of the money on a trip to Bourges , where there 's something beautiful to look at , and wine , and dancing in the streets . p. 35 SQUIER If I were you  --  I 'd stay here , Gabrielle , and avoid disappointment . GABBY What makes you think I 'd be disappointed ? SQUIER I 've been to France . GABBY You were there in the war ? SQUIER No , I missed that . But I lived there for eight years , through seventeen changes of government . GABBY What were you doing  --  writing books ? SQUIER No  --  planning to write books . You know what a gigolo is ? GABBY Were you one of those ? He nodsYou danced with women for money ? SQUIER Oh lord , no ! I never was a good enough dancer for that . I  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think too ill of me . I once actually wrote a book . GABBY What was it  --  fiction ? SQUIER In a sense . It was a novel about the bleak , glacier-stripped hills of my native New England . I was twenty-two when I wrote it , and it was very , very stark . It sold slightly over six hundred copies . It cost the publisher quite a lot of money , and it also cost him his wife . You see , she divorced him and married me . She had faith in me , and she had the chance to display it , because her husband was very generous in the financial settlement . I suppose he had faith in me , too . She saw in me a major artist , profound , but inarticulate . She believed that all I needed was background , and she gave it to me  --  with southern exposure and a fine view of the Mediterranean . That was considered the thing to do in the period that followed Scott Fitzgerald . For eight years I reclined there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited for the major artist to step forth and say something of enduring importance . He preferred to remain inarticulate . p. 36 GABBY And you 've left your wife , now ? SQUIER Yes . GABBY I 'm glad you did . SQUIER I left her at her suggestion . She had taken up with a Brazilian painter  --  also a major artist . There was nothing for me to do but travel . I decided to go forth and discover America  --  and I 've gone this far on my journey , thanks to the power of the thumb . He gestures with his thumb GABBY What were you looking for ? SQUIER Well  --  that 's rather hard to say . I  --  I suppose I 've been looking for something to believe in . I 've been hoping to find something that 's worth living for  --  and dying for . GABBY What have you found ? SQUIER Nothing so interesting as an old man who was missed by Billy the Kid , and a fair young lady who reads Villon . GABBY after a pause . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SQUIER I 'm sure you do . GABBY I would n't tell this to everybody  --  but you  --  well , you 're kind of p. 37 SQUIER I 'm kind of nobody . What is it , Gabrielle ? GABBY I paint pictures . SQUIER Are they any good ? GABBY Hell , no ! SQUIER Could I see them ? GABBY Oh  --  I never let people look at them . I 'd only get kidded . They 're kind of crazy pictures . SQUIER All the better . Please let me see them . GABBY You know anything about Art ? SQUIER Oh  --  I 've studied the whole cycle  --  right from El Greco through Burne Jones and back to El Greco again . Perhaps you 're another genius . Perhaps it 's my mission to introduce you to posterity . GABBY Are you kidding me ? SQUIER No , Gabrielle . I 've never kidded anybody outside of myself . The voice of HERB , a cowboy , is heard off stage GABBY All right . But you 've got to promise not to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's worth . GABBY goes out HERB Sure , Boze . I know you 've got all the inside dope . But I 'll bet you four bits he flattens him inside of five rounds . p. 38 BOZE Four bits to what ? HERB No  --  I ai n't giving you no odds . BOZE All right ! HERB All right ! HERB has come in during this cheerful challenge . He wears a big black hat , grey shirt and blue overalls , and carries a gunnysack HERB genially , to SQUIER . How de do . SQUIER still eating . Good evening . HERB Where 's Gab ? SQUIER She 'll be back in a moment . HERB has crossed to the counter HERB They sure give you a good meal here , do n't they ? SQUIER Superb ! HERB Well  --  I 'll tell you . Jason Maple 's got a natural-born gift for hotel keeping , and by God I think Gabby 's better at it than he is . The only trouble with ' em is , they ai n't got a hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that does restrict the full play of their talents . GABBY comes in with a sheaf of watercolor paintings of comparatively small size but of virulent color p. 39 HERB Hi , Gab . GABBY Hi , Herb . Nervously she puts the pictures face down on the table by SQUIER . She cautions him with a look not to display them to HERB . But during the subsequent dialogue , SQUIER peeks at them with a certain amount of neck-stroking bewilderment HERB Got any moon ? GABBY Sure . HERB How much you asking for it ? GABBY A dollar fifty a bottle . HERB Holy Cow ! Well  --  give us a bottle , and half a dozen bottles of beer . GABBY You fellers going to get drunk to-night ? She has gone to the counter to fill the order HERB leaning on the counter . By God  --  that 's the way it looks . Sheriff called up the old man and asked if we could be spared for patrolling the roads and the old man says sure and the sheriff says he 'll come out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so we got a poker game started up the road a piece and thought we might as well have something to go along with it . GABBY There you are , Herb , That 'll be two thirty . p. 40 HERB All I got 's two bucks . He tenders itWill you trust me for the thirty cents ? GABBY I 'll take back two bottles of beer . That 'll make it even . HERB as he dumps the bottles into the gunnysack . Gosh  --  liquor sure is getting expensive these days . Well  --  I guess we got enough here seeing there 's only three of us . GABBY How you going to play poker if you have n't got any more money ? HERB Oh , we got a book , So long , Gabby . GABBY So long , Herb . He goes out . GABBY rings up the $2.00 in the cash register and comes down . She is eager to know how SQUIER feels about her paintings , but she is trying desperately hard to be offhand about itThey 're terrible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with rapt attention SQUIER I  --  I do n't know . Is  --  this a portrait of some one ? GABBY That 's Paula , our Mexican cook . She 's the only one knows I ever try to do that junk . It is n't much of a likeness . SQUIER I 'm sure it was n't intended to be . He picks up another pictureCertainly no critic could condemn you for being photographic . p. 41 GABBY This is the one I like best . SQUIER looks at itI wanted to show how the storm clouds look when they roll down from the mountains . SQUIER What made you paint in this strange manner ? GABBY It 's  --  just the way I feel . SQUIER You 're a product of the ultimate French school , all right . GABBY pleased . You think so ? SQUIER These are somewhat in the Dufy manner  --  and yet  --  a lot less conventional . GABBY But are they any good ? SQUIER I tell you , Gabrielle  --  I ca n't say . I 'm tremendously impressed , and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could get to France . You know , they 've got some of the finest art schools in the world there . And they 've got beautiful things to paint , too  --  flowers , and castles and rivers . But here in this desert  --  it 's just the same thing over and over again . SQUIER Do n't you realize  --  there are probably thousands of artists in France to-day who are saying , " I 'd find a really big theme for my canvas if I could only get out to Arizona . " p. 42 GABBY I know . A lot of people come out here and go crazy about the desert . They say it 's full of mystery , and it 's haunted , and all that . Well  --  maybe it is . But there 's something in me that makes me want something different . SQUIER looking at her . I know there 's something in you . I wish I could figure out what it is . GABBY Listen  --  you 've been in France . What are they like there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sweeping judgment . GABBY I 've always imagined they must all be like Villon  --  gay , reckless , poetic . SQUIER No  --  I should n't call them any of those things . Especially , not reckless ! GABBY But they 're always having a good time , are n't they ? SQUIER Not invariably . GABBY Maybe I know them better than you do , because it 's in my blood . Sometimes I can feel as though I were sparkling all over , and I do n't care what happens  --  I want to go out and do something that 's absolutely crazy  --  and marvelous . But then the American part of me speaks up and spoils everything . It makes me go to work and figure out a lot of dull accounts : so many pounds of coffee , so many frankfurters , so many rolls . p. 43 SQUIER You keep the accounts correctly ? GABBY If I did n't , this place would be bankrupt . SQUIER Then that 's the French part of you . The sparkle must be 100% American . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to marry anybody . I want to always be free ! SQUIER How about that stalwart youth out there in the football jersey ? GABBY What makes you think I 'd take any notice of him ? SQUIER Well  --  when I came in here GABBY Oh , sure . He was kissing me . That 's nothing . SQUIER Perhaps . But there 's always the chance of development . GABBY He 's trying to make me . That 's all he wants . SQUIER Do you think he 'll succeed ? GABBY I have n't decided yet . It would be experience , and that 's what I need . Do you think I ought to give in ? SQUIER Do n't ask me , Gabrielle . Let your French blood guide you . It 's infallible , in matters like that . GABBY But you ought to know something . You 've seen a lot , and you 've written a book , and you 've been married p. 44 SQUIER I do n't know anything . You see  --  the trouble with me is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the intellectuals . GABBY That means you 've got brains . I can see you have . SQUIER Yes  --  brains without purpose . Noise without sound . Shape without substance . Have you ever read " The Hollow Men " ? She shakes her headDo n't . It 's discouraging , because it 's true . It refers to the intellectuals , who thought they 'd conquered Nature . They dammed it up , and used its waters to irrigate the wastelands . They built streamlined monstrosities to penetrate its resistance . They wrapped it up in cellophane and sold it to drugstores . They were so certain they had it subdued . And now  --  do you realize what it is that is causing world chaos ? GABBY No . SQUIER Well , I 'm probably the only living person who can tell you . It 's nature hitting back . Not with the old weapons  --  floods , plagues , holocausts . We can neutralize them . She 's fighting back with strange instruments called neuroses . She 's deliberately afflicting mankind with the jitters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not by the likes of us . She 's taking the world away from the intellectuals and giving it back to the apes Forgive me , Gabrielle I ca n't tell you what a luxury it is to have someone to talk to . But do n't listen to me . I was born in 1901 , the year Victoria died . I was just too late for the Great War  --  and too soon for the revolution . You 're a war baby . You may be an entirely different species , for all I know . You can easily be one of Nature 's own children , and therefore able to understand her , and laugh at her  --  or enjoy her  --  depending on how you feel . You 're the only one who can say whether or not you should yield to the ardors of Number 42 out there . He finishes his glass of beerThat beer is excellent . p. 45 GABBY It 's made in Phnix . She is looking at him intentlyYou know  --  you talk like a goddam fool . SQUIER I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarettes GABBY No wonder your wife kicked you out . And no wonder she fell for you in the first place . He pauses in the act of lighting his cigarette SQUIER That sounds alarmingly like a compliment . GABBY It is a compliment . What did you say your name was ? SQUIER Alan Squier . I 've been calling you Gabrielle , so you 'd botter GABBY Where are you going from here , Alan ? SQUIER That depends on where this road leads . GABBY It leads to the petrified forest . SQUIER What 's that ? GABBY Oh  --  just a lot of dead old trees in the desert , that have turned to stone . SQUIER The petrified forest ! A suitable haven for me . Perhaps that 's what I 'm destined for  --  to make an interesting fossil for future study . Homo Semi-Americanus  --  a specimen of the in-between age . p. 46 GABBY I was just thinking  --  I 'd like to go to France with you . He looks at her , sharply  --  then looks sharply away SQUIER Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . GABBY You mean you have n't enough money ? SQUIER Even that is an understatement . GABBY I have n't enough , either  --  yet . But I can do this as well as you can . She gestures with her thumb SQUIER We 'd reach a point , on the Atlantic Coast , where even that gesture would be unavailing . GABBY You know , Alan  --  there 's something about you that 's very appealing . SQUIER Appealing ! Yes  --  that 's been my downfall . It was that very quality which led me into the gigolo trade . GABBY Why would n't you like to be a gigolo for me ? SQUIER For one very good reason : you could n't afford it . GABBY But I will be able to afford it . SQUIER On your share of this property ? He shakes his head p. 47 GABBY Listen  --  I 've got more than that coming to me . Do you know how much Gramp has got salted away in the bank in Santa F ? Twenty-two thousand dollars ! He had every cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why  --  we did n't even know about it until the government passed a law against hoarding and they printed his name in the papers . It 's in Liberty Bonds now , and it 's all willed to me . I guess we could travel pretty far on that , could n't we ? SQUIER Too far . GABBY We could go to France , and you 'd show me everything , all the cathedrals and the art  --  and explain everything . And you would n't have to marry me , Alan . We 'd just live in sin and have one hell of a time . SQUIER That 's a startling proposal , Gabrielle . I had n't expected to receive anything like that in this desert . GABBY We 'd have to wait  --  maybe years . But I could have Boze fired and give you the job tending the gas station . SQUIER You think you 'd like to have me for a companion ? GABBY I know I would . And I do n't make mistakes . You 're no apeman , Alan  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grade below appealing . p. 48 GABBY Would n't you like to be loved by me ? SQUIER looking at her intently . Yes , Gabrielle I should like to be loved by you . GABBY You think I 'm attractive ? SQUIER There are better words than that for what you are . GABBY Then why do n't we at least make a start at it ? You have n't got anything else to do . SQUIER smiling . No  --  that 's just it . You could n't live very long with a man who had nothing else to do but worship you . That 's a dull kind of love , Gabrielle . It 's the kind of love that makes people old , too soon . He risesBut  --  I thank you for the suggestion . You 've opened up a new channel of my imagination which will be pleasant to explore during my lonely wanderings . I 'll think of the chimes of Bourges  --  and you  --  and sin . GABBY You 're going now ? SQUIER Yes . And I shall continue going until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his message to posterity . GABBY rising . Well  --  I ca n't stop you . p. 49 SQUIER No . Gabrielle , you ca n't . But you can do me one great favor , before I go . Would you mind very much if I kissed you good-by ? GABBY looks at him levelly GABBY No . I would n't mind . SQUIER You 'd understand that it would be nothing more GABBY I 'd understand . It 'd be just a kiss  --  that 's all . SQUIER That 's absolutely all . He kisses her . BOZE is seen through the glass of the doorway . He bursts the door open BOZE Ah-hah ! So that 's what 's been going on in here ! Necking , huh ! He strides up to SQUIER and seizes him by the shoulderWho the hell are you ? GABBY Lay off him , Boze . She has seized up her paintings BOZE Just because she 's cute and sweet you thought you could get fresh , huh ! GABBY He did n't get fresh ! He only wanted to kiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to explain  --  but I BOZE You need n't wait to explain it . Pay your check and get out . p. 50 SQUIER Very well . How much do I owe , Miss Maple ? GABBY Thirty cents . BOZE Is that all he ate ? He looks down at the table at the remains of SQUIER 'S meal GABBY Yes ! Shut up ! SQUIER Thirty cents , eh . Very reasonable . Very reasonable indeed ! But  --  that brings us to another embarrassment . I  --  I have n't got thirty cents . I have n't anything . BOZE Well  --  by God  --  I did n't expect to find such nerve in anybody that looked like you . What are you going to do about it ? SQUIER I have n't the remotest BOZE What have you got in your pack there ? SQUIER Shirt , underwear , socks , toothbrush , passport , an insurance policy , and a copy of " Modern Man in Search of a Soul , " by Dr. Jung . BOZE You thought you could pay with a kiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car is heard stoppingThought if you brought a little romance into her poor , starved life the check 'd be forgotten , did you ? GABBY Take your hands off him , Boze . Go on , Alan , beat it ! p. 51 SQUIER I 'll go . BOZE I 'll just give you a little headstart . He has SQUIER by the collar and is about to propel him out the door when MR. and MRS . CHISHOLM come in . MR . CHISHOLM is about forty-five  --  thin , dry , sharp , persnickety , with pince-nez eyeglasses . MRS . CHISHOLM is about ten years younger  --  rather attractive , rather chic , very world-weary . The CHISHOLMS belong to the topmost layer of society in Dayton , Ohio MRS . CHISHOLM in an undertone to GABBY . Where is the Ladies ' Room , please ? GABBY This way , madam . She directs MRS . CHISHOLM to the door at the left and points offThat door there , on your left . MRS . CHISHOLM Thank you . JOSEPH , the CHISHOLMS ' Negro chauffeur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elegant , wears a neat uniform and yellow glasses JOSEPH We want fifteen gallons and a quart of oil . BOZE Be right with you . In an undertone to SQUIERYou ready to leave ? SQUIER Just a moment  --  my rucksack . p. 52 GABBY Get on the job , Boze . She goes up to the lunch counter and hides her paintings . BOZE mutters something unpleasant to SQUIER and goes out . SQUIER is pulling on his rucksack CHISHOLM What kind of cigars have you ? GABBY Admiration , White Owl , and Texas Dandies . CHISHOLM How much are the Texas Dandies ? GABBY Three for a dime . CHISHOLM Let me have an Admiration . GABBY offering him the box . Come far ? CHISHOLM selecting one . Yes . We 've driven from Dayton , Ohio . We 're on our way out to Santa Barbara for the winter . As he pays for the cigarWe lost a great deal of time to-day , as I wanted Mrs. Chisholm to see the Gila cliff dwellings . She was rather disappointed . How far is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hundred miles from here . She hands him his change CHISHOLM consulting his watch . I imagine we can make it by midnight . p. 53 GABBY You 'll have to step . What kind of a car you driving ? CHISHOLM lighting the cigar . Duesenberg . SQUIER Good-by , Miss Maple . GABBY Just a minute , Alan . She turns again to CHISHOLMExcuse me , sir . CHISHOLM What ? GABBY Would you have room in your car for another party ? SQUIER signals to her not to bother CHISHOLM suspicious . Who is it ? GABBY This friend of mine , Mr. Squier . He 's on his way to the coast and he  --  he has n't got a car just now . He 's an author . CHISHOLM to SQUIER . Have you any luggage ? SQUIER Just this , sir  --  on my back . CHISHOLM looks him over , goes to the open door , and calls " JOSEPH ! " CHISHOLM Where 'd you come from ? SQUIER From Saint Tropez . That 's on the Riviera . JOSEPH comes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think it 's all right to give this man a lift to Phnix ? JOSEPH subjects SQUIER to extremely critical inspection SQUIER You 've been there ? CHISHOLM Yes JOSEPH taps SQUIER all over for concealed weapons SQUIER It 's a lovely spot , Saint Tropez . CHISHOLM without enthusiasm . Yes . JOSEPH I guess he 's all right , Mr. Chisholm . CHISHOLM Very well . JOSEPH touches his cap and goes outGlad to have you with us . SQUIER Thank you very much , Mr. Chisholm . GABBY punches the " No Sale " key and takes out a silver dollar . SQUIER crosses to herAnd thank you , Miss Maple . I 'll remember your kindness . GABBY I forgot to give you your change . She offers him the dollar SQUIER Oh , no  --  I wanted you to keep that . GABBY pointing to a sign . Tipping is un-American and we do n't allow it Here  --  take it . p. 55 SQUIER I  --  I ca n't very well pretend that I do n't need GABBY Perhaps Mr. Chisholm will take you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , send me a postcard , with a view of the Pacific Ocean . I like pictures of the sea . She has forced the coin into his hand MRS . CHISHOLM emerges CHISHOLM This is Mr.  --  er  --  GABBY Mr. Squier . CHISHOLM Mr. Squier , darling . We 're giving him a lift as far as the Phnix Biltmore . MRS . CHISHOLM frownsIt 's all right ; Joseph went over him . SQUIER How do you do , Mrs. Chisholm . MRS . CHISHOLM How do you do . Are we ready to start ? She crosses toward the door CHISHOLM Just been waiting for you . Come along , Mr. Squier . The CHISHOLMS have gone out SQUIER I suppose I 'll never see you again . GABBY No . That 's the way it is in a gas station . They come and they go . SQUIER But , somehow or other , I 'll repay that dollar . God knows when . p. 56 GABBY Perhaps we 'll run into each other some day in Bourges . The horn of the Duesenberg is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaking hands . Good-by , Alan . He goes out . After a moment , she comes down and picks up the Poems of Franois Villon . The car is heard starting and charging off into the night . GABBY suddenly remembers the neon sign , goes to a switch by the door and turns it on . BOZE comes in BOZE Well  --  I took pity on that poor panhandler . I slipped him a dime . GABBY You did ? BOZE I tried to  --  but he would n't take it . He said , " I do n't deserve your kindness , " and handed it back . It 's a funny thing about a guy like that : he 'll hold you up for a meal and think nothing of it . But when it comes to taking money , they suddenly discover they 've got some pride . GABBY I appreciate that very much , BOZE . BOZE Appreciate what , honey ? GABBY Your wanting to help him . That was very kind . BOZE Why , say  --  you talk as if you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuts about him . But now and then you see somebody that 's just a natural object of charity . BOZE pleased . Well ! If you appreciate it so much  --  how about being a little nice to me for a change ? He goes to her and takes hold of her arms GABBY I 'd like to be nice to you I 'd like to be nice to everybody . BOZE You can be , Gabby . Listen  --  how about us taking a little walk around the Mesa ? It 's warm out and the moon 's just coming up . How about it , sweetheart ? GABBY But supposing a car came along wanting something ? BOZE You know there 's practically no traffic at this time of night . GABBY But suppose some one did come BOZE Well  --  what if they did ? In a pinch , the old man and that Mexican woman could take care of ' em . And you know how your grandfather is  --  he 'd never notice anything peculiar about us being out for a while . He goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow up sometime . And before you can grow up , you 've got to stop being afraid . GABBY I 'm not afraid ! p. 58 BOZE Oh , yes , you are . You think I 'm something terrible and you 've got to keep away from me . But I 'm not so bad , Gabby . I 'm just a big guy with a good heart and plenty of hot blood . And I 'm full of love , honey . He takes her in his armsAnd so are you . You do n't know it yet - but you are . And when we get out there in the moonlight , you 'll be glad I suggested it . Honestly you will , honey sweet . He kisses her lips passionately . After a moment , she struggles a little . He relaxes his hold on her . He is confident of progressAll right  --  I 'm not holding you against your will . I 'm not trying to force you into anything that 's wrong . GABBY I did n't say you were . BOZE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minds of old cranks that have forgotten how to love  --  if they ever knew . My God ! It 's the most natural thing in the world , for two people , like us , that are young , and clean , and Why , it 'd be wrong if we did n't take the chance when we 've got it . GABBY Do you know what he said ? BOZE What who said ? GABBY He said we 'd been trying to fight Nature , and we thought we 'd licked it , because we 've built a lot of dams , and cellophane and things like that . But that 's where we 're wrong , and that 's what 's the matter with the world . We 've got to admit that Nature ca n't be beaten ! p. 59 BOZE Well  --  is n't that exactly what I 've been trying to tell you all along ? GABBY I guess it is , Boze . He takes her in his arms again BOZE You 're coming with me , are n't you , sweetheart ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful and exciting than anything you ever dreamed of . Are n't you , honey sweet ? GABBY Oh , well  --  what the hell ! I 'll go out with you , Boze . He kisses herWe 'd better go now . BOZE Yes , Gabby . Oh , God  --  you 're a beautiful kid ! He kisses her again , passionately . A car is heard stopping . They break apart , quickly I 'll get rid of ' em fast . He starts toward the door , but stops short when it opens and JACKIE appears . He is a short , chubby , cherubic gangster . He carries a sub-machine gun and wears a cheery smile JACKIE Now  --  just behave your-selves , folks , and nobody 'll get hurt . Who 's the boss here ? BOZE He 's out . JACKIE Got any guns with you ? He searches BOZE with practised speed BOZE No . He and GABBY have been retreating into the room as JACKIE has advanced . Following JACKIE has come RUBY , thin , sallow , adenoidal  --  and after him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vaguely thoughtful , saturnine face . He is about thirty-five and , if he had n't elected to take up banditry , might have been a fine left-fielder . There it about him one quality of resemblance to ALAN SQUIEE : he too is unmistakably condemned . He is hatless and unshaven and wears an ill-fitting suit with a grey prison shirt . MANTEE carries no visible arms , but RUBY has another machine-gun and a sawed-off shotgun p. 60 JACKIE This is Duke Mantee , folks . He 's the world-famous killer and he 's hungry . The DUKE looks around DUKE What 's in there and in there He speaks quietly , even gently , with an effortless ferocity GABBY That 's the kitchen , and in there 's our bedrooms . DUKE You two married ? GABBY No . He just works here . JACKIE Anybody else in ? BOZE Only one old man and GABBY My grandfather 's in there and the cook . There 's nobody in there . DUKE Bring ' em in , Jackie . JACKIE O. K. , Duke . He goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front door and calls out DUKE Hey , Pyles . PYLES 'S voice is heard to reply : " Yeah , boss . " Back that car into the shadow and stay with it . PYLES 'S VOICE Do I get to eat ? DUKE You 'll eat . The DUKE goes to the table , down-stage right , and takes his coat off , revealing a harness over his waistcoat with two revolvers in holsters under either arm-pit . He folds his coat neatly and lays it on the bench , then turns to RUBYHey , Ruby  --  pull that table over here . RUBY moves the table to the right as directed . BOZE lowers his hands p. 61 DUKE Keep ' em up . The hands go up promptly . RUBY picks up his machine gunTake a look around in there . RUBY How long do we stay here ? DUKE Until they get here . RUBY you 're going to wait for that blonde ? DUKE Get out ! RUBY O. K. He goes out at the lower left DUKE you sit down there . BOZE sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eat , sister ? GABBY produces the menu card . The DUKE addrerses BOZEFootball plyers. eh ? BOZE Yes . And you better not let me get close enough to take a sock at you . DUKE unconcerned . I used to be quite a fan . What 's your school ? BOZE Nevada Tech . DUKE Never heard of it . GRAMP and PAULA the cook come in from the kitchen , followed by JACKIE PAULA Do n't shoot me , mister . Do n't , kill me , mister . In the name of the Holy Mother of God , do n't Kill me , mister . JACKIE prods her with the machine gun . She screams lustily p. 62 JACKIE Quiet , Pepita  --  quiet . We are n't going to do you any harm . In a ludicrously soothing voiceAll we 're going to do is ask you to cook something . You would n't mind that , would you , Pepita ? PAULA No , mister . I swear to God , I cook anything . You just tell me JACKIE All right , Pepita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DUKE . so you 're Mantee , are you ! You 're the killer ! DUKE Would you mind sitting down over there , Pop ? Take a look around that counter , Jackie . GRAMP sits down at the left . JACKIE searches the counter JACKIE Yes , Pop . That 's the greatest killer alive to-day . Did you hear what happened in Oklahoma City ? The DUKE inspects the menu GRAMP Yes  --  I heard . You pulled off a massacre . JACKIE Who said it was a massacre ? He comes down from the counter GRAMP The Denver Post . He holds up the paper JACKIE snatching it . Let me see it ! DUKE . Put that paper down ! JACKIE drops the paper p. 63 JACKIE Did it say how many we killed ? GRAMP Six killed and four wounded . JACKIE Did you hear that , Duke ? We killed six and wounded four . He returns to the counter to empty the cash register DUKE to GABBY . Got any steak ? GABBY Only hamburger . PAULA And we got chicken , mister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live . DUKE All right . Cook the chicken and four hamburgers . And plenty of onions . JACKIE Boy ! That was some massacre ! GABBY Anything else ? RUBY comes in from the lower left RUBY Nobody in there , boss . There 's a good window at the end of the hall with a four-foot drop to the ground , right by where the car is . DUKE Take a look around outside . Tell Pyles not to hit that horn unless somebody comes up that really looks like trouble , and then to hit it plenty . RUBY goes outBring us beer for the bunch , sister . He addresses BOZE and GRAMPYou fellers like to join us ? p. 64 BOZE I never touch it . GRAMP I guess I 'll have whisky . GABBY to GRAMP . No , none for you , Gramp . GRAMP disconsolate . She says I ca n't have even a little one . DUKE Let him have it , sister . JACKIE Sure ! He can only be young once . PAULA Can I begin cooking now , mister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RUBY returns JACKIE Come on , Pepita . And while the chicken 's in the oven , you and me 'll have a little fun , eh , kid ? They go out into the kitchen DUKE Hey , Ruby . Sit down there . RUBY sits down between the counter and the front doorAnd keep that gun in your lap . RUBY obeys , and from now on his eyes ceaselessly patrol the area from the front door to the kitchen door . The DUKE crosses with a convict 's gait and goes out at the left . GABBY is behind the counter getting out the beer . GRAMP rises and starts to cross to his rocking chair p. 65 RUBY Sit down ! GRAMP sitting down hastily . You need n't think I 'm scared of you . I 've known real killers in my time . And they knew how to make a six-shooter act like a machine gun . Did you ever hear of fanning ? RUBY No . GRAMP Well  --  you 'd file down the trigger catch so that the hammer worked free , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his forefinger at RUBY and wiggles his thumbWild Bill Hickock once knocked over five men that way . They was lined up at a bar and SQUIER comes in , hatless and breathless . GABBY is in the centre of the stage , with the tray of bottles and glasses of beer GABBY Alan ! What did you come back for ? SQUIER panting . There are some bandits around here . BOZE Yes . So we heard . SQUIER They cut in ahead of us about a mile down the road , and made us stop and get out , and then they got into Mr. Chisholm 's car and drove off . They said we could take thoir car , but they 'd left it locked . They were terrible-looking cutthroats , with a lot of guns and ammunition . He addresses BOZECould you come with me back there and see if you can unlock that The DUKE comes in from the left p. 66 GABBY Look out , Alan ! SQUIER turns and sees the DUKE . Then he looks around and sees RUBY who has raised his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet again . DUKE Sit down , pal . Down there . SQUIER . Why , thanks , I 'd be delighted to DUKE Wait a minute . He takes the ruck-sack from SQUIER , who then sits down opposite BOZE at the centre table GRAMP proudly . That 's Duke Mantee . We were looking at his picture . Remember ? SQUIER Yes  --  I remember . The DUKE goes to the extreme right and sits down , his back to the wall DUKE Join us in a glass of beer ? SQUIER Why  --  thank you  --  but might I have some whisky , instead ? DUKE Certainly . Give him a drink , sister . And how about turning on the radio ? GABBY puts the bottle and a glass before SQUIER . He pours himself a stiff one GRAMP What did I tell you ? Look at that chin . He 's a killer , all right ! p. 67 BOZE He 's a gangster and a rat ! SQUIER Sh ! GRAMP He ai n't a gangster ! He 's a real old-time desperado . Gangsters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sheriffs find out he 's here , we 'll see some real killing  --  wo n't we ? GABBY turns on the radio . Soft , sticky music emerges DUKE The cops ai n't likely to catch up with us  --  not to-night . So we can all be quiet and peaceable , and have a few beers together , and listen to the music  --  and not make any wrong moves . Because  --  I may as well tell you , folks  --  old Ruby there , with the machine gun  --  he 's pretty nervous and jumpy and he 's got the itch between his fingers . So let 's everybody stay where they are . SQUIER Let there be killing ! All evening long , I 've had a feeling of Destiny closing in . To the DUKEDo you believe in astrology ? DUKE I could n't say , pal . SQUIER I do n't  --  normally . But just now , as I was walking along that road , I began to feel the enchantment of this desert . I looked up at the sky and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were pointing the way to that gleaming sign , and saying , " There 's the end of your tether ! You thought you could escape it , and skip off to the Phnix Biltmore . But we know better . " That 's what the stars told me , and perhaps they know that carnage is imminent , and that I 'm due to be among the fallen . It 's a fascinating thought . p. 68 DUKE Let 's skip it . He lifts his glassHere 's happy days . GRAMP Yes sir  --  it sure is pleasant to have a killer around here again . SQUIER Yes . It 's pleasant to be back again  --  among the living . He raises his glassHooray ! He drinks@@ About half an hour has elapsed since the end of Act I. DUKE and JACKIE are finishing their meal at the right table . RUBY is sitting on a stool at the counter , drinking coffee , watching everyghing GRAMP and PAULA are sitting at the table at the left . BOZE and SQUIER are at the centre . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move about  --  removing dishes , refilling coffee cups . GRAMP That old Andy Anderson I was telling you about , he was a great character . He did n't kill for business reasons , like you fellers . He killed just for the fun of it . He was born some-wheres up in Nova Scotia and come down to the State of Maine so 's he could get into the Civil War and he fit all through it . And he never stopped talking about it as long as he lived . He always said that was a regular paradise for killing . He 'd stick a Johnny Reb with his bayonet , throw him over his shoulder and then stick another . And he always said that the beauty of it was there was no sheriffs around to reprove him for it . JACKIE Say , Pop  --  I wish you would n't talk so much about blood while we 're eating . BOZE Got it on your conscience , eh ? p. 70 JACKIE On my what ? BOZE Yes  --  I thought so . A punk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coyote . JACKIE Hmm ! Listen to the half-back . How much did you get for playing on the team ? BOZE I worked my way through college ! JACKIE What were you doing ? Peddling subscriptions to The American Boy ? BOZE I worked for three whole years in the Student Laundry . JACKIE Oh  --  how nice ! He lifts his coffee cup BOZE Wait a minute  --  smart guy . I got something to show you . He reaches for his wallet RUBY Keep your hand off your hip ! BOZE I was only going to show him a newspaper clipping that said I ought to be All-America . I scared you , did I ? I know it . You 're all yellow . A none too pleasant expression appears in JACKIE 'S eyes over the rim of his coffee cup SQUIER I 'd be a little tactful , Boze . Remember  --  they 're your guests . GABBY has sat down at the centre table between SQUIER and BOZE p. 71 BOZE They 're a bunch of yellow dogs . That 's what made ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no . Cowardice is n't the cause of crime . It has something to do with glands . BOZE They just have n't got the guts to face the bigger problems of life . They 've got to fight their way with guns instead of with principles . SQUIER is by now slightly tight and is to become more so , by imperceptible degrees , as the Act proceeds . JACKIE sets down his coffee cup with ominous deliberateness and rises , picking up a sawed-off shotgun JACKIE Step over to that side of the room , half-back . GRAMP You 're going to kill him ? BOZE scared . It 's just what I said JACKIE Come on . This shotgun scatters , and you would n't want me to hurt that cute dame , would you ? The dulcet chimes of the radio are heard . BOZE slowly rises SQUIER to JACKIE . You know  --  you 're taking this much too seriously . The radio announcer 's voice can be heard introducing the nightly news broadcast p. 72 BOZE I 'm not afraid to die . But his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Step up that radio  --  will you , sister ? To JACKIESit down , Jackie Cooper . JACKIE Did you hear what he ? DUKE grinning . Sit down ! To BOZEYou too . They both sit down . GABBY has turned up the volume control dial RADIO VOICE very brisk . all anxious first off to hear latest bulletins concerning the greatest man-hunt in human history . A monster drag-net has been cast over the entire South-west from St. Louis to the Pacific Coast . National Guardsmen are cooperating with state police and the famed Texas Rangers as well as countless local posses and Legion posts in a determined effort to apprehend the members of the notorious Mantee gang  --  to bring to justice this fierce , colorful band of murderers , kidnappers , bank-robbers , perpetrators of the shocking massacre in Oklahoma City . JACKIE Take a bow , Duke . RADIO VOICE The gang made its escape in two cars , one of which contained Mantee and three other men , the other car containing three men and one woman . The Mantee car was seen early this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The second car was positively identified at Estelline in the Texas Panhandle when it stopped at the local police station , held it up , and departed with a large supply of guns and ammunition . p. 73 JACKIE Nice going , boys ! I do n't see how they did it with Doris along to DUKE Shut up ! RADIO VOICE Both cars are undoubtedly headed for the border , but it is considered certain they have n't reached it , due to the number and vigilance of the patrols . War-time conditions prevail on all the roads of Western Texas , New Mexico and Arizona and you know how the officers of the law are in this red-blooded frontier region : they shoot first and ask questions afterward . JACKIE indicates his scorn , but DUKE withers him with a look RADIO VOICE The Governor of Arizona has issued the following statement : " As long as Mantee and his followers are at large a blot of shame will mar the proud scutcheon of these United States . Any citizen who knowingly gives aid or comfort to these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be answerable before the great bar of public opinion . " I 'll now give you the scores of the leading football games of the day . Carnegie Tech  --  13 , Miami  --  7 ; Washington State  --  19 DUKE Turn it off , sister . RADIO VOICE U. S. C.  --  O ; Navy  --  21 , Virginia  --  6 GABBY switches off the radio p. 74 JACKIE to PAULA . Did you hear that , Pepita ? You 're a traitor for cooking for us . They 'll string you up for that  --  if they can find a tree around here . PAULA The Holy Mother of God knows they put a gun in my stomach and said You cook JACKIE Sure  --  she knows . But that do n't count with the Governor . We 're Public Enemies . DUKE to RUBY . Go on out to the car , Ruby , and tell Pyles to come in and get his supper . And tell him to bring in that sack of ammunition and the road-map . And you stay there and keep awake . RUBY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to make a run for the Border , boys ? JACKIE Oh , sure ! We 'll give you our whole route before we leave , so 's you can tell the hick cops and have ' em give us a motorcycle escort . SQUIER I think I 'm about ready for another whisky , Gabrielle , if I may . GABBY goes behind the counter and brings forth a quart bottle and a bottle of drinking water , which she places on the table BOZE Listen , Panhandler ! Who told you you could call her by her first name ? p. 75 SQUIER Now , please , Boze  --  you and I must be friends , as long as they 'll let us . JACKIE Why do n't you take a sock at him , half-back ? He has n't got a gun . PYLES comes in . He is a lean , lithe Negro , who carries a machine gun and a bulging gunnysack PYLES Hi , everybody ! ' Bout time you got around to asking me in . Here 's your map , boss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bench at the back , and tosses the map down on the table before DUKELord God ! Look what you done to that chicken ! DUKE to PAULA . Cook him some hamburger , sister . PAULA All right , mister . She risesBut you people better tell that Mister Governor I did n't DUKE Go with her , Pyles . PYLES O. K. , boss . I guess I do n't get to eat with the white folks . He picks up the carcass of the chicken and starts to gnaw it as he crosses to the kitchen DUKE Look around in there and see if you can find any rope . PYLES O. K. , boss . He turns quickly to the DUKEWhen we going to lam out of here ? p. 76 DUKE When it 's time . JACKIE Sure  --  as soon as the Duke connects with that heavy date . He winks broadly at PYLES PYLES as he goes . Well  --  I do n't like that dame stuff . I like to get out of range . He has gone out at the left after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and New Mexico , and from now on he and JACKIE are studying it and murmuring to each other in inaudible tones GRAMP How about passing that bottle over this way ? SQUIER Why , certainly . Forgive me . He is reaching for the bottle , but GABBY stops him GABBY No ! To GRAMPYou 've had all you 're going to get . SQUIER to GRAMP . I 'm very sorry . GRAMP Oh  --  that 's all right . He reaches in his pocket for his pipe JACKIE What are you doing ? GRAMP Going to smoke my pipe . DUKE Go ahead , Pop . GRAMP takes out the pipe , fills it with great care , lights it , and lapses into silence as he sits in his rocking chair p. 77 BOZE How long are you yeggs going to stick around here ? JACKIE Keep quiet , half-back . BOZE The longer the better , to suit me . Because the U. S. Government is after you and pretty soon they 'll be sending for your relatives to identify the bodies and it will probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in years . GABBY You 'd better do what you 're told and keep your trap shut . SQUIER That 's good advice , Boze . Because those glandular phenomena I was talking about manifest themselves in sudden and violent ways . BOZE savagely . How are you going to pay for all that liquor you 're drinking ? BOZE is in an ugly mood , the result of humiliating frustration , and he is taking it out on the one completely defenseless person present SQUIER I can pay , and will pay , Boze . For every drop ! I have a dollar . BOZE Oh , you have ! So you were holding out on us when you SQUIER No  --  No . I 've acquired it since then . BOZE Where did you get it ? GABBY Probably those rich people give it to him . Now lay off ! The kitchen door opens and PYLES appears p. 78 PYLES Here 's some clothes-line , boss . DUKE Throw it down . PYLES tosses the coil on the floor and vanishes into the kitchen BOZE So you turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has its price , eh ! SQUIER If you must know  --  I 'll tell you the extent of my pride . Gabrielle gave me the dollar . BOZE to GABBY . You did ? GABBY It 's none of your goddam business what I do . BOZE You were feeling kind of generous to-night , were n't you ? He turns to SQUIERWould you like to know what she was just going to give me when those rats showed up ? Would you like to know ? GABBY Well  --  speaking of rats ! Of all the low , slimy , stinking SQUIER No , Gabby . You must n't blame Boze for anything he says now . He 's a man of muscle , and he 's suffering from the pangs of frustration . GABBY I say , you 're a dirty , low , stinking BOZE I did n't mean it , Gabby . GABBY Then why the hell did you start ? p. 79 BOZE I 'm terribly sorry , honey sweet . They 've got me absolutely crazy mad , with those shotguns and machine guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is . BOZE I did n't know what I was saying . Will you please forgive me , Gabby ? GABBY No ! Never ! BOZE humbly . All right . SQUIER I sympathize with you utterly , Boze . Did you ever read " All Quiet on the Western Front " ? BOZE No . SQUIER Well  --  all of us here tonight are under very much the same tension . You 'd better have a drink , old man . He has one himself BOZE ignoring SQUIER . I love you , Gabby . Startled by this sudden declaration , SQUIER sets down his glassI love you , sweetheart  --  and if I thought I 'd done or said anything to hurt you , I 'd go over and I 'd hang one on those yeggs and die for it , gladly . Please tell me you forgive me , honey sweet . SQUIER Excuse me . He stands upWould you rather I left ? p. 80 JACKIE Stay where you are ! SQUIER But I 'm intruding . JACKIE Sit down ! SQUIER sits GABBY That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hide . Have we , Boze ? BOZE No  --  worse luck . GABBY to SQUIER . I told you he 'd been trying to make me . BOZE Now , listen GABBY And to-night , just after you left , he went at it again . And I decided I was ready to give in to him , and find out what it 's like . BOZE That 's a dirty trick  --  telling that , before a total stranger . SQUIER to BOZE . Honestly , Boze  --  I 'm not blaming you  --  not for an instant . GABBY to BOZE . I 'll say this much for you : you 're a pretty good lovemaker when you get going . BOZE I was n't turning on any act . I told you I was full of love , and I was telling the truth , and I do n't care who knows it . JACKIE has arisen and started to cross toward the left with the map p. 81 JACKIE Full of love , are you , halfback ? DUKE And do n't let that Mexican hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JACKIE I 'll be careful , Duke . I do n't want to die . I got a dame , too . To BOZEKeep it up , half-back . I 'm rooting for you . Touch-down ! He goes into the kitchen BOZE to GABBY . It does n't make any difference to you what I 'm trying to tell you  --  because you do n't know what it means to be really crazy about somebody . She looks at him , through him , for a moment GABBY For all you know , maybe I do . BOZE I do n't believe it . Who have you ever ? DUKE Get me a cigar , will you , sister ? GABBY rising . We 've got Admiration , White Owl , and Texas Dandies . DUKE Whatever costs the most . GABBY has gone back of the counter to get a cigar-box , which she takes down to the DUKE GRAMP You fellers going to spend the night here ? p. 82 DUKE Ca n't say , Pop . Maybe we 'll decide to get buried here . GABBY hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SQUIER You 'd better come with me , Duke . I 'm planning to be buried in the Petrified Forest . I 've been evolving a theory about that that would interest you . It 's the graveyard of the civilization that 's been shot from under us . It 's the world of outmoded ideas . Platonism  --  patriotism  --  Christianity  --  Romance  --  the economics of Adam Smith  --  they 're all so many dead stumps in the desert . That 's where I belong  --  and so do you , Duke . For you 're the last great apostle of rugged individualism . Are n't you ? DUKE has been calmly defoiling a cigar , biting the end off , and lighting it DUKE Maybe you 're right , pal . SQUIER returning to his drink . I 'm eternally right . But what use do I make of it ? DUKE I could n't say . BOZE to GABBY , who is resuming her seat . Who were you ever crazy about ? GABBY Is it any of your business ? BOZE Everything about you is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to know  --  it 's him . SQUIER startled . What ? GABBY I was just telling Boze that I 'm crazy about you . BOZE That panhandler ? GABBY You do n't know the worst of him . He 's more than a panhandler . He 's a gigolo . BOZE Did you ever see him before ? GABBY No . But that does n't matter . I love him . I do n't think I 'll ever love anybody else . SQUIER Can I possibly be drunk ? GABBY You will be if you keep hitting that rye . BOZE How did you happen to get that way , Gabby ? GABBY I do n't know . Just something . SQUIER I swear before God , Boze  --  I was n't trying to be seductive . BOZE scornfully . No  --  I do n't believe you could even try . GABBY After you left , Alan  --  I felt as if something had been taken out of me  --  or sort as if I 'd come out of a dream . I caught on to myself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'll never be anything else . I 'd better get rid of all the girlish bunk that was in me , like thinking so much about going to France , and Art , and dancing in the streets . And I 'd better make the most of what I can find right here  --  and it happened to be you , Boze . Do you know what I asked him ? I asked him to let me go away with him , and live in sin . She turns again to SQUIERBut you would n't have done it , even if we 'd had the money  --  would you , Alan ? SQUIER is looking straight into her eyesWould you ? p. 84 SQUIER No , Gabrielle . GABBY to BOZE . You see  --  he does n't give a hoot in hell for me . I saw that , plainly enough . And it only made me love him all the more . And that 's why I was willing to go out into the moonlight with you , when Duke Mantee came in . DUKE I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with anybody 's fun . BOZE with labored insincerity . Oh  --  that 's all right . It was probably all for the best . DUKE Yes . When I look at you , I guess it was . The DUKE turns and opens the window at his side about three inches SQUIER still looking at GABBY . I 'm sorry now that I came back . BOZE has darted a look at the DUKE , and there is born in his mind an idea : By a sudden , tiger-like leap , he might get possession of the shotgun which is lying on the table BOZE I 'll take a drink of that stuff . GABBY passes him the bottle which has remained on the table . BOZE pours himself a stiff one , drinks it  --  and , a moment later , pours and consumes another . But he is constantly , furiously watching the DUKE p. 85 SQUIER still looking at GABRIELLE . When I went out before  --  it was the poignant ending to a  --  an idyllic interlude . But now it 's spoiled . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're sorry you heard the real truth ? SQUIER I told you that I 'm the type of person to whom the truth is always distasteful . GABBY That wife of yours must have been terrible . SQUIER Why do you think so ? GABBY Because she 's talked all the heart out of you . I could put it back , Alan . SQUIER with sudden irritability . No ! Do n't delude yourself . If you have love , and do n't know what to do with it , why do n't you lavish it on Duke Mantee ? There 's your real mate  --  another child of Nature . GABBY You 'd better not drink any more of that rye . SQUIER It 's not the rye ! It 's the same disease that 's afflicting Boze ! Impotence ! He stands up DUKE Sit down , pal . SQUIER What do you care whether I sit or stand ? What can I do to assail your superiority ? p. 86 DUKE I got to think about my health , pal . SQUIER If I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . I want to talk to him . Indicating GRAMP GRAMP Me ? DUKE You can talk sitting down . I heard you doing it . SQUIER sitting down . Very well GRAMP What 's on your mind ? SQUIER Those Liberty Bonds of yours , buried in Santa F. GRAMP sharply . How do you know about them ? SQUIER What are you going to do with them ? GRAMP Going to leave ' em where they are ! SQUIER Yes  --  leave them where they are ! Your granddaughter is stifling and suffocating in this desert when a few of your thousands would give her the chance to claim her birth-right . GRAMP Yes  --  and maybe give you the chance to steal it . I 've heard what you 've been saying . SQUIER That 's a low way to justify your stinginess . Oh  --  I know you were a pioneer once . But what are you now ? A mean old miser , hanging on to that money as though it meant something . Why in God 's name do n't you die and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be drunk . DUKE rising menacingly . Yes  --  drunk  --  or just about the lowest grade son of a bitch I ever run across . What do you mean talking to an old man like that ? RUBY appears in the door RUBY Say  --  there 's three people coming down the road . Two men and a woman . Look to me like the owners of that Duesenberg . DUKE O. K. Keep quiet when they get here . RUBY It 's all right out here . You can see plain in the moonlight . It 's kind of nice to look at , too . He goes out SQUIER I admit it , Duke . I was guilty of bad taste  --  and I apologize , Mr. Maple . GRAMP Sure . DUKE You 'd better crawl , or I might have to put the lug on you . Talking to an old man like that SQUIER Listen , Duke . If you had any of Robin Hood in you you 'd go to Santa F , and rob that bank , and give it to her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it should be used GRAMP She 'll get it when she needs it  --  when she has a family of her own to support  --  and probably a good-for-nothing unemployed husband DUKE turns to look out the window . BOZE sees his chance . He effects the tiger-like leap , seizes the shotgun and wrests it from the DUKE 'S frantic grasp . BOZE backs away quickly , covering the DUKE p. 88 BOZE breathless with excitement . Put ' em up ! Now I 've got you . I 've been waiting for this chance . I 've been watching every move you MR. and MRS . CHISHOLM appear in the doorway , followed by JOSEPH . Seeing BOZE with the shotgun , and DUKE with hands up , MRS . CHISHOLM screams . BOZE whirls to cover them . As he does so , DUKE whips out one of his revolvers and fires . BOZE drops the shotgun and grabs his left hand with his right . The kitchen door flies open and JACKIE hurtles out DUKE Get that gun . As JACKIE dives for the shotgun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has followed JACKIE out of the kitchen , his machine gun at the alert , his mouth full RUBY from off right . Get back there or I 'll shoot you dead ! GABBY Are you hurt , Boze ? DUKE to JACKIE . Give me that Tommy . JACKIE gives his machine gun to DUKE . MR. and MRS . CHISHOLM and JOSEPH return , followed by RUBY BOZE He got me in the hand . His left hand is seen to be covered with blood p. 89 JACKIE So you tried to be brave , did you ! DUKE Frisk ' em , Ruby . RUBY hurriedly taps the CHISHOLMS all over MRS . CHISHOLM Let us out of here ! We did n't have anything to do with this . JACKIE Shut up . MRS . CHISHOLM I wo n't have that man pawing me . DUKE Get back to the car , Ruby . RUBY They 're harmless , Duke . He goes DUKE Sit down over there . Come on ! Step ! You down there . The CHISHOLMS sit at the centre table , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bandage him , sister . He 'll be all right . Go with ' em , Jackie  --  and you better take that line and tie him up and leave him in there . GABBY and BOZE cross toward the left JACKIE picking up the clothes-line . I 'll tie him . BOZE to the CHISHOLMS . Goddam you ! Why did you have to pick that moment to come in here ? CHISHOLM Why indeed ! p. 90 GABBY Come on , Boze . BOZE Oh , God ! I had the chance and I muffed it . I could have got Mantee and got him good . JACKIE Tough luck , half-back . You made a nice try . GABBY and BOZE go out at the left followed by JACKIE PYLES Say , boss  --  we better lam out of here . DUKE We go when I say so . PYLES contemplating the CHISHOLMS . But if any more people come in here we 'll have to be sending out for recruits . He turns to JOSEPHHi-yah , colored brother ! JOSEPH with dignified asperity . Good evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't need me ? They almost got you that time . DUKE Almost ai n't good enough . Go on . PYLES O. K. , boss . He goes out into kitchen GRAMP Say , Mantee  --  did you mean to hit him in the hand or was that a bad shot ? DUKE quietly . It was a bad shot , Pop . But I had to get it off fast . Now , listen  --  I let that mug make a mug out of me . But  --  do n't anybody try that again . Just keep in mind that I and the boys are candidates for hanging , and the minute anybody makes the wrong move , I 'm going to kill the whole lot of you . So keep your seats . He returns his revolver to its holster , picks up the Tommy gun and sits down at the right . There is a dead pause p. 91 CHISHOLM Are you Mantee ? DUKE Yes , pal . MRS . CHISHOLM I knew it was a mistake to take that hitch-hiker into the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with it . MRS . CHISHOLM He certainly did n't help matters much . SQUIER was at first stunned by BOZE 'S spectacular action  --  then , as he thought it over , resentful  --  and then , as he thought still more , determined to do something spectacular himself . He has helped himself to another stiff slug of rye SQUIER gravely . I 'm afraid that 's unanswerable , Mr. Chisholm . I have not helped matters at all  --  up to now . He finishes his drink and turns to DUKEWould you mind passing me that rucksack that 's on the bench beside you ? DUKE What do you want with it ? SQUIER I want to get out my life-insurance policy . If you reach in there , you 'll find it , in a bundle of papers . The DUKE reaches with his left hand and extracts the papers GRAMP What do you want with your insurance ? Expecting to die ? p. 92 SQUIER You 've guessed it , Mr. Maple . The DUKE tosses the bundle to SQUIERThank you . Now can I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He points to his breast pocket . The DUKE nods . SQUIER takes out his pen , and starts to write on the policy CHISHOLM to the DUKE . What about my car ? DUKE That 's a nice bus you got there . CHISHOLM Are you going to restore it to me ? And my luggage DUKE You 're likely to get the car back . Let 's hope it wo n't be all full of bullet holes and blood . MRS . CHISHOLM There 's one little travelling case with some  --  some things I need : Can I please have that ? DUKE I took a look in that case . MRS . CHISHOLM You 're going to steal it ? DUKE Yes , ma'am . I got a friend that likes rubies . MRS . CHISHOLM You 're a filthy thief ! DUKE Yes , ma'am . CHISHOLM Look here , old man . How much will you take to let us out of here ? p. 93 DUKE How much have you got ? CHISHOLM I could let you have  --  say  --  two hundred dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timorously over to the DUKE , produces his wallet and starts to take out some billsJust put down the whole wallet . CHISHOLM does so , with trembling handsGot any more ? CHISHOLM patting his pants pockets . Only some small change . DUKE Keep it . MRS . CHISHOLM rising . Now can we go ? DUKE No . CHISHOLM But I understood that you DUKE Sit down where you were . MRS . CHISHOLM You are a cheap , contemptible , crooked thief CHISHOLM Be quiet , Edith . He resumes his seatWe 're in his hands . There 's nothing we can do  --  but hope that some day the United States Government will take some measures to protect the lives and property of its citizens . The DUKE has been calmly taking all the money from the wallet p. 94 DUKE Here 's your wallet , pal . He tosses it to CHISHOLM , who stoops to pick it up SQUIER has finished writing . He turns to the DUKE and from now on speaks rapidly and with a peculiar earnestness SQUIER Duke  --  I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SQUIER I do n't think you 'll refuse it . Because  --  you 're a man of imagination . You 're not afraid to do  --  rather outlandish things DUKE What are you getting at ? SQUIER This insurance policy  --  it 's my only asset . It 's for five thousand dollars  --  and it was made out in favor of my wife . She 's a rich woman , and she does n't need that money  --  and I know she does n't want it , from me . I 've written on the policy that I want the money paid to Miss Maple  --  that young lady in there . If Mr. and Mrs. Chisholm will witness my signature , I 'm sure it will be all right . My wife would never contest it . She 's a good sort  --  really she is . Well  --  what I 'm getting at is this , Duke : after they 've signed , I wish  --  I 'd be much obliged if you 'd just  --  kill me . The DUKE looks at him levellyIt could n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they catch you they can hang you only once  --  and you know better than any one else they already have more than they need against you . And you ca n't be bothered by any humane considerations . You 'd have a hard time finding a more suitable candidate for extermination . I 'll be mourned by no one . In fact , my passing will evoke sighs of relief in certain quarters . You see , Duke  --  in killing me  --  you 'd only be executing the sentence of the law  --  I mean , natural law  --  survival of the fittest p. 95 GRAMP My God  --  he is drunk ! DUKE Sure  --  and having a fine time showing off . SQUIER Of course I 'm showing off . I 'm trying to outdo Boze in gallantry . But is there anything unnatural in that ? Boze was ready to sacrifice his life to become an All-American star . And I 'm ready to do likewise . He addresses the CHISHOLMSCa n't you see I mean it ? CHISHOLM I 'm afraid I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame you . But you must remember that this is a weird country we 're in . These mesas are enchanted  --  and you have to be prepared for the improbable . I 'm only asking that you attest to my signature on this MRS . CHISHOLM I believe you do mean it ! SQUIER Good for you , Mrs. Chisholm ! You 're a kindred spirit ! I 'll bet that you , too , have been thrilled by " A Tale of Two Cities . " MRS . CHISHOLM You 're in love with her , are n't you ? SQUIER Yes  --  yes , I suppose I am . And not unreasonably . She has heroic stuff in her . She may be one of the immortal women of France  --  another Joan of Arc , or Georges Sand , or Madame Curie . I want to show her that I believe in her  --  and how else can I do it ? Living , I 'm worth nothing to her . Dead  --  I can buy her the tallest cathedrals , and golden vineyards , and dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And it will gain a measure of reflected glory for him who fired it and him who stopped it . He holds up the insurance policyThis document will be my ticket to immortality . It will inspire people to say of me : " There was an artist , who died before his time ! " Will you do it , Duke ? p. 96 DUKE quietly . I 'll be glad to . SQUIER Then can I have this signed ? DUKE Sure . CHISHOLM to GRAMP . Is he by any chance insane ? GRAMP Do n't ask me . He 's no friend of mine . MRS . CHISHOLM Of course he 's insane . But what of it ? SQUIER gives her the policy and the pen SQUIER Thank you , Mrs. Chisholm . Please sign where I 've written , " Witnessed this day . " They start to signI 'm going to entrust this to you , Mr. Maple . And after I  --  after the Duke has obliged , put it in the hands of some good lawyer for collection . My passport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much . As they hand him back the policyHere , Mr. Maple . He rises and hands the policy to GRAMP DUKE Let me know when you want to be killed . SQUIER Pick your own moment , Duke . Say  --  just before you leave . He strides up-stage nervously , aimlesslyBut I 'd prefer to have her think that you did it in cold blood . Will you all please remember that ? PYLES comes in p. 97 DUKE O. K. , pal . But for the time being , you better sit down . You might get to feeling reckless . SQUIER sits down SQUIER I want to . Now  --  I think we 'd all better have a drink . MRS . CHISHOLM Good ! SQUIER to PYLES . Would you mind passing glasses to Mr. and Mrs. Chisholm ? PYLES Sure . He goes behind the counter for glasses , while SQUIER pours himself anotherSay , boss  --  let 's lam it out of here . I do n't like all them big windows . He takes the glasses down to the CHISHOLMS DUKE We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't to trust a dame . They probably got lost down there in the panhandle . DUKE They know this country like a book . Doris was the one who picked this place for meeting up . PYLES Well  --  I wish to God she 'd show . DUKE Where 's that cook ? PYLES She 's all right . I looked her up . PYLES has been passing glasses around . GRAMP has been reading the policy carefully . He turns his attention to PYLES p. 98 GRAMP Hey  --  I 'll have a little of that , too . PYLES pouring a drink . Why  --  certainly . DUKE Do n't give it to him , Pyles . The girl says he ought n't to have it . SQUIER Better not , Mr. Maple , we 'll all need clear heads for what is to come . GRAMP My head 's never been muddled yet . PYLES to JOSEPH . Here , brother  --  you better take it . JOSEPH Is it all right , Mr. Chisholm ? PYLES ashamed for his race . Listen to him ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you heard about the big liberation ? Come on  --  take your drink , weasel ! CHISHOLM Go ahead , Joseph . JOSEPH Thank you , sir . PYLES hands the drink to JOSEPH , then crosses to the right , and sits down on the bench by the DUKE . GRAMP has finished inspection of the policy and is putting it in his pocket SQUIER Do you think it 's legal ? GRAMP Seems so to me . But I 'd like to tell you just one thing , my friend . p. 99 SQUIER And what is that , Mr. Maple ? GRAMP There ai n't a woman alive or ever did live that 's worth five thousand dollars . SQUIER And let me tell you one thing  --  you 're a forgetful old fool . Any woman is worth everything that any man has to give  --  anguish , ecstasy , faith , jealousy , love , hatred , life or death . Do n't you see  --  that 's the excuse for our existence ? It 's what makes the whole thing possible , and tolerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn better sense . MRS . CHISHOLM to her husband . Did you hear that ? CHISHOLM wearily . I heard . SQUIER to GRAMP . That lovely girl  --  that granddaughter of yours  --  do you know what she is ? No  --  you do n't . You have n't the remotest idea . GRAMP What is she ? SQUIER She 's the future . She 's the renewal of vitality  --  and courage  --  and aspiration  --  all the strength that has gone out of you . Hell  --  I ca n't say what she is  --  but she 's essential to me , and the whole damned country , and the whole miserable world . And please , Mrs. Chisholm  --  please do n't look at me quizzically . I know how I sound . p. 100 MRS . CHISHOLM to SQUIER . I 'm wondering if you really believe all that  --  I mean , about women ? She has already had one stiff drink and is about to have another SQUIER Of course I do  --  and there 's a man who agrees with me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know , pal . I was n't listening . SQUIER Then permit me to speak for you . He turns again to MRS . CHISHOLMHe could have been over the border long ago , and safe  --  but he prefers to stay here and risk his life . And do you know why ? MRS . CHISHOLM Why ? SQUIER Because he has a rendezvous here with a girl . Is n't that true , Duke ? DUKE Yes , pal  --  that 's it . MRS . CHISHOLM to the DUKE . Do you mean to say you ever have time for romance ? DUKE Not much , lady . SQUIER Certainly he has ! Just like the Knights of the Round Table  --  between dragons . DUKE I guess we 're all a lot of saps . But I would n't be surprised if he was the champion . He turns to SQUIERDid you think I was kidding when I said I 'd be glad to knock you off ? p. 101 SQUIER I hope that neither of us was kidding . Did you think I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Say ! What you talking about ? DUKE Shut up ! SQUIER You gave me the idea , Duke , when you called me a low grade son of a bitch . Forgive me , Mrs. Chisholm . I hope you do n't object to that phrase . MRS . CHISHOLM Not in the least . DUKE I take it back . You 're all right , pal . You 've got good ideas . I 'll try to fix it so 's it wo n't hurt . SQUIER raising his glass . You 're all right , too , Duke . I 'd like to meet you again some day . He drinks DUKE Maybe it 'll be soon . MRS . CHISHOLM You know  --  this frightful place has suddenly become quito cosy . She finishes her second drink SQUIER That 's my doing , Mrs. Chisholm . You ought to thank me for having taken it out of the realms of reality . MRS . CHISHOLM excitedly . I 'm going to see something at last  --  and after that dreadful dull day looking at cliff dwellings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be witnesses at a murder ? He 's actually going to shoot him p. 102 SQUIER Sh  --  please be careful , Mrs. Chisholm . GABBY comes in from the left , followed by JACKIEHello . How 's Boze ? GABBY He 'll be all right . PYLES Did you tie him up good ? JACKIE Yeah  --  in the bathroom . Say , Duke , it 's after ten o'clock . PYLES Yeah , boss . DUKE We 'll give ' em a few more minutes . SQUIER significantly . A few minutes . DUKE with a slight grin . Not so much more time , pal . JACKIE wanders out for a visit with RUBY GABBY Listen , Gramp  --  I 've got an idea we ought to sell out right away , to-morrow . It 's the best chance we 'll ever have , because this place is going to get advertised all over the country and people will be flocking here just to see where Duke Mantee stopped . I 'll bet Dana Trimble will boost his offer sure . She is standing by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aiming to take that trip to France ? p. 103 GABBY No  --  the hell with that ! I 'm asking you to do it for Dad 's sake . Let him get located in Los Angeles  --  and maybe I 'll find that writer with Warner Brothers , and maybe I 'll get a job  --  and then we 'll all be rich . GRAMP Do n't sound likely to me . GABBY You ca n't tell , Gramp . There might be a great future for Dad in the Legion . That 's what he wants , and you ought to give him a whack at it . SQUIER And would you be content with that ? GABBY savagely . I 'm not thinking about myself ! I do n't care what happens to me . SQUIER But you must think about yourself . You want to be a great painter , do n't you ? Then you 'll have to get used to being a colossal egotist , selfish to the core . GABBY Are you going to give me more advice ? You and your talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you . SQUIER I did  --  but GABBY Well , that 's all the advice I 'm going to take . She turns away from him MRS . CHISHOLM Do you mind if I speak up , my dear ? Perhaps I could tell you some things that p. 104 GABBY What do you know about me ? CHISHOLM Nothing ! If I were you , Edith , I 'd keep out of MRS . CHISHOLM turning on him . You have n't the remotest conception of what 's inside me , and you never have had and never will have as long as you live out your stuffy , astigmatic life . She turns to GABBYI do n't know about you , my dear . But I know what it means to repress yourself and starve yourself through what you conceive to be your duty to others . I 've been through that . When I was just about your age , I went to Salzburg  --  because I 'd had a nervous breakdown after I came out and I went to a psychonalyst there and he told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He gave me a letter to Max Reinhardt , and I might have played the Nun in " The Miracle . " But my family of course started yapping about my obligations to them  --  who had given me everything , including life . At least , they called it " life . " They whisked me back to Dayton , to take my place in the Junior League , and the Country Club , and the D. A. R.  --  and everything else that 's foul and obscene . And before I knew it , I was married to this pillar of the mortgage , loan and trust . And what did he do ? He took my soul and had it stencilled on a card , and filed . And where have I been ever since ? In an art metal cabinet . That 's why I think I have a little right to advise you . p. 105 CHISHOLM closing his tired eyes . Dear God ! MRS . CHISHOLM You need n't look so martyred ! You know perfectly well that until this minute I 've never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a self-effacing CHISHOLM his eyes are now open . Never complained , eh ! Forgive me if I indulge in some quiet , mirthless laughter . MRS . CHISHOLM What you 've wanted is a wife who 's an ornamental Cipher And , God knows  --  I 've tried and tried to be just that CHISHOLM When ? MRS . CHISHOLM I 've given you what you wanted  --  at the cost of my individuality , my self-respect  --  and  --  and everything else CHISHOLM At the cost of nothing ! I suppose you 've never come storming into the office and created a scene just when I was straining every faculty to find ways to pay for MRS . CHISHOLM to GABBY . There  --  my dear ! CHISHOLM Your insane extravagance MRS . CHISHOLM Be quiet ! CHISHOLM abandons the argument , as is his wont MRS . CHISHOLM again to GABBYPerhaps you 'll understand now what I mean . Profit by my example and realize that perhaps you have something important to give to the world . Do n't let them stifle you with their talk about duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 106 GRAMP Suppose she learns there 's nothing there to find ? MRS . CHISHOLM Even so  --  it would be better than endless doubt  --  which has been may portion . She pours herself another drink . GABBY sits down at the left SQUIER You know  --  it 's the damndest thing about this place . There 's something here that stimulates the autobiographical impulse . To the DUKEWhat kind of life have you had , Duke ? DUKE A hell of a life . MRS . CHISHOLM I do n't believe it . DUKE Why not , lady ? JACKIE returns and sits on a stool at the counter MRS . CHISHOLM Because you 've had the one supreme satisfaction of knowing that at least you 're a real man . MR . CHISHOLM again shuts his eyes DUKE Yeh  --  that 's true . But what has it got me ? I 've spent most of my time since I grew up in jail , and it looks like I 'll spend the rest of my life dead . So what good does it do me to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be crawling into the hay with some dame ? MRS . CHISHOLM after a slight , thoughtful pause . I wonder if we could find any hay around here ? p. 107 CHISHOLM past vehemence . For the love of God , Edith JACKIE Say ! What 's been going on here ? SQUIER I 'm not sure  --  but I think the Duke has had an offer . MRS . CHISHOLM He certainly has ! And it was made with all sincerity , too . PYLES Now , listen , boss  --  do n't you go getting into no hay with her . Because we got to lam it out of here . DUKE Thanks very much , lady . When I get settled down in Mexico , maybe I 'll send you a postcard , with my address . SQUIER Excuse me , Duke  --  but how 's the time getting along ? DUKE It 's just about up , pal . SQUIER turning to GABBY . I must talk to you , Gabrielle . GABBY You can wait until after they 've gone . SQUIER I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I go . I have to tell you now that I love you . GABBY Now listen , Alan . I got sort of upset by all that blood , and I do n't want to SQUIER I tell you solemnly that I love you , with all the heart that is left in me. p. 108 JACKIE Are we waiting just to listen to this ? MRS . CHISHOLM He does love you , my dear . He told us so . SQUIER Please , Mrs. Chisholm . I 'm capable of saying it . He turns to GABBYEven if I 'm not capable of making you believe that I GABBY Do n't make a fool of yourself , Alan . They 're all staring at you . SQUIER I know they are . But you 've got to believe it , and you 've got to remember it . Because  --  you see  --  it 's my only chance of survival . I told you about that major artist , that 's been hidden . I 'm transferring him to you . You 'll find a line in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Thus in your field my seed of harvestry will thrive .

CHISHOLM Be quiet  --  you block gorilla ! PYLES What you call me ? He rises , his machine gun at the alert DUKE She pegged you , all right , Pyles . Sit down ! Somewhat reluctantly , PYLES obeys p. 109 SQUIER You still think I was being comic ? GABBY No , Alan . I just think that you  --  you 're kind of crazy . And I guess so am I. And that 's why I think we 'd be terribly happy together . SQUIER looks into her eyes SQUIER Do n't say that , Gabrielle . GABBY Why not  --  when I believe it , with all my heart . SQUIER after a moment . Well  --  maybe you 're right GABBY You 're beginning to admit it SQUIER Maybe we will be happy together in a funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes forward and kneels beside him JACKIE Hey ! DUKE Leave ' em alone ! GABBY Alan ! If you 're going away , I 'm going with you  --  wherever it is . SQUIER taking hold of her hand , No , Gabrielle . I 'm not going away , anywhere . I do n't have to go any farther . Because I think I 've found the thing I was looking for . I 've found it  --  here , in the Valley of the Shadow . p. 110 GABBY What , Alan ? What have you found ? SQUIER I ca n't say what it is , Gabrielle . Because I do n't quite know , yet ! He looks into her eyes for a moment , then turns suddenly to the DUKEAll right , Duke . We need n't wait any longer . Three sharp toots from the Duesenberg are heard DUKE Watch it , boys ! PYLES and JACKIE hastily duck out of range of the windows CHISHOLM What was that ? JOSEPH It was our horn , Mr. Chisholm . JACKIE is by the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , covering those in the room JASON Who 's that ? RUBY Stick up your hands ! The DUKE has levelled his machine gun through the slightly open window DUKE We got you covered by machine guns . Open that door , Jackie . Come on , boys . Walk in the front door , and keep ' em up ! Cover the door , Jackie JACKIE I got it . DUKE Come on ! Keep coming ! JASON comes in , followed by two fellow LEGIONNAIRES  --  one , the COMANDER , a peppery little man , and another who is burly and stupid . All are in the same gaudy uniforms and all look bewildered p. 111 DUKE Got those guns , Jackie . JACKIE systematically disarms the LEGIONNAIRES . He tosses the guns into the ammunition sack . RUBY comes to the door RUBY All clear out here . DUKE Is their car in our way ? RUBY No  --  it 's a good mask . DUKE O. K. Get back to the car . RUBY disappears into the night JASON Is this a stick-up ? JACKIE What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Duke Mantee . Been here all evening . He and his gang picked this place out of the whole South-west . DUKE What 's that uniform you 're wearing ? JASON It 's the Ralph M. Kesterling Post of the American Legion . COMMANDER I 'm the commander of this post , buddy , and I want to tell you that all of us men fought in the world War . You would n't shoot us down in cold blood ! JACKIE cheerfully . Sure we would . DUKE Sit down , boys . p. 112 ANOTHER LEGIONNAIRE very basso . Where ? JACKIE On your cans , Legion . DUKE Down there on the floor  --  in a bunch  --  and stay there .
