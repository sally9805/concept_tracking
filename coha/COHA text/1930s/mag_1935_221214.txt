The five Piccirilli brothers of The Bronx are the world 's greatest team of sculptors . But , like the Pisani of the 13th Century , they prefer to think of themselves as " masters of stone . " As such , they make most of their money anonymously converting into their own Italian marble the clay and plaster models of less handy and sometimes more famed U. S. sculptors . Last week , for probably the first time in Piccirilli history , someone else had the job of executing work by a Piccirilli . <P> For a year Brother Attilio worked on the design , first in clay , then in plaster , for the world 's biggest sculptural glass panel , to go over the door of the Italian Building in Manhattan 's Rockefeller Center . The panel , 10 ft. by 16 ft. , took seven tons of clay , showed one huge figure shoveling . The Piccirillis are not glass workers . The model went to the Corning Glass Works for casting . Corning divided the panel into 45 sections to be joined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass filled with air bubbles . Last week Corning had finished the Italian Building panel , promised delivery next month . <P> The Piccirillis are the Bronx climax of a distinguished family of Tuscans who , originally from Spain , worked in stone for two centuries around Carrara and Massa between the mountains and the sea , fought with Garibaldi and emigrated to Manhattan in 1888 . <P> The father was a sculptor . All six of his sons followed his example : Ferucchio , now 73 and back in Italy ; Furio , 71 , specialist in animal figures ; Tommaso , 69 , summering last week at Far Rockaway , L. I. ; Attilio , 67 , foremost sculptor of the brothers ; Horatio , 65 , another animal specialist ; Guitilio , 63 , marble carver , critic and the firm 's businessman . All but Ferucchio are now U. S. citizens . <P> Forty-five years ago Father Piccirilli moved from central Manhattan to The Bronx , built a red brick house across several city lots with a large carriage door through which to haul out big sculptures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to study at Rome 's Accademia San Luca . U. S. sculptors presently found that the Piccirillis could finish their works in marble better than they could themselves . Through the years the six brothers faithfully executed such work by other sculptors as Frederick MacMonnies ' Civic Virtue in Manhattan , Daniel Chester French 's great Lincoln in the Lincoln Memorial in Washington , D. C. , and Robert Aitken 's pediment for the west portico of the brand new Supreme Court Building in Washington , into which Sculptor Aitken put the faces of Chief Justice Hughes , William Howard Taft , John Marshall ( as a boy ) , Architect Cass Gilbert and himself . The brothers ' business boomed . The red brick house grew to a 20-room catacomb of high-ceilinged workshops , spare of furniture , full of great lumps of stone , clay , plaster . One piece , a huge statue of James Monroe , ordered and paid for by a Venezuelan President who lost his job unexpectedly , stood around for 30 years until the Piccirillis gave it to the State of Virginia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' storage charges .
