THE PEARL NECKLACE A STORY BY GORDON ARTHUR SMITH A FTER Monsieur Georges had ac-complished the really extraordinary and hazardous feat of stealing the emerald pendant from Madame Felix Simonet , daughter of the Prefect of Police of Paris , he wrote her a brief note asking her to meet him the following day at a quiet tea establishment near the Place Venckime . He wanted ( reasonably enough , for she was a beautiful woman ) to renew their acquaintance ; and he wanted , quite unreasonably , to return the emerald of which he had so cleverly deprived her . Valentine Simonet , tremulous with curiosity and , at the same time , filled with a not unpleasant fear , arrived at the rendez-vous almost on time . She was quietly lovely in blue crepe de chine , and she wore some very good pearls about her graceful throat . When she had put them on she had wondered if she were not taking a grave risk for , although Monsieur Georges might he a gentleman , there was no denying that he was a thief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheerful cherub . He said that it was kind of her to have come . " But think , " she said , " of the bait that you held out . Who could refuse a cup of tea in return for an emerald pendant  --  and such an emerald pendant ! " Still smiling , he drew from his pocket a small package wrapped in tissue paper , and handed it to her across the tea table . " Madame , " he said , " I broke into your apartment to steal this emerald for a covetous tittle American girl . I am aware now that , artistically , it was ashameful , inexcusable blunder , for the American is not worthy of so exquisite a stone . But you , madame  --  ah , to think that I should have contemplated the sacrilege of robbing beauty of beauty  --  I , who pride myself not a little on my sense of the appropriate . I am a thief , yes , but , I trust , not a vandal . I do not snatch obelisks from Egypt or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Buddhas from China . I do not take the perfect picture from the perfect frame . I should , if it were possible , far prefer to take both frame and picture . Since in this instance , madame , that is not possible ? " he regarded her gravely and ardently and respectfully ? " since that is not possible , I return the picture to its proper and exquisite frame . " Color came rapidly to her cheeks , and the very good pearls at her throat reflected a faint tint of rose . This Monsieur Georges , she said to herself , was rather startling . Aloud she said , " Are n't you being quixotic , monsieur ? Sha n't you , perhaps , regret your  --  well , shall we call it your generous gesture of an artist ? " " I shall have no regrets , " he assured her firmly . " In that case I can only say that I am very grateful . " And she reached out and took the small package from the table and put it in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitable words . It was very difficult , what she wanted to say , and it was absurdly embarrassing " I feel , " she said at length , " that I ought to insist on your taking a reward . " He laughed cheerlessly . " I do n't want any reward , madame , that you would be willing to give . " She must have suspected what he meant , but she was a very womanly woman and not averse to being made love to discreetly . Moreover , Monsieur Georges was a charming courtier and , for a thief , amazingly polished . " What is it , " she asked recklessly ? " what is it that I would not be willing to give ? " " The picture and the frame , " he murmured . She met his earnest eyes for a moment before looking down and busying herself with a sticky cake . When she spoke it was in a parable . " The Mona Lisa , " she said , " was once stolen from her frame in the Louvre ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was some time ago , and the picture and frame still remain in the Louvre . The Museum felt no obligation to return them both to the thief . Neither , as yet . has been given away , and I doubt very much if they ever will be . " He bowed . " One can only hope , " he said . And then he added , " Can one even hope ? " " One is always allowed to look at pictures and frames , " she said , " but one is requested not to touch them . " Monsieur Georges thereafter looked at Valentine Simonet as often as she would permit . Of necessity their meetings were infrequent and conducted with extreme discretion , for Madame Simonet was endeavoring to divorce a reluctant and jealous husband , and Monsieur Georges had excellent reasons of his own for shunning publicity . But there was , he found , an unholy zest in making love to the daughter of the Prefect of Police of Paris . Monsieur Georges was , alas ! a cheerfully impudent thief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in spite of himself , if he were not being just a little too foolhardy ? moments of weakness or , perhaps , of wisdom , when he realized that be was placing his freedom in Valentine 's slim , incapable hands . At a word from her , whether deliberate or accidental , his debonair existence would end abruptly and he would find himself hemmed in by the walls that make ( in spite of the poet ) a prison , and the iron bars that make a cage . And then one late summer evening an incident occurred that led , eventually , not to a catastrophe but to a disillusionment . It was September and there were acres of stars and a serene , round moon traveling among them up the sky , and a girl weeping almost too conspicuously , Monsieur Georges thought , in the shadow of a doorway . A harder-hearted man than he would have passed her by , and indeed Monsieur Georges himself might have done so had he not , after a brief glance , decided that she was young and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of his tastes and temperament , he stopped and went to her and laid his hand on her shoulder . " Pourquoi pleurez-vous , " he inquired , " quand it ne pleat pas ? " And to himself he said , " The little wretch is play-acting in the hope of snaring a credulous man . " The girl looked up as if startled and rubbed her eyes and her nose with the back of her hand . She snuffled generously for a moment before she answered . " I am crying , " she said , " because I am hungry , Monsieur Georges . " He was not especially surprised that she should call him by his name , or rather by the name he had chosen for himself . The Montmartre was his Quarter of Paris , and in it he was as well known to the glad , bad residents as was the Moulin Rouge or the Sarre-Ceeur . " I perceive that youknow me , " he said . The girl nodded and snuffled and said nothing . He put his hand under her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better look at her . She was , as he had suspected , a pretty girl . With her close-clipped hair , parted at the side and brushed fiat back over her head , she might almost have been a pretty boy . Her features were small and good , except for her mouth , which was better  --  a wide , red , daring mouth , far too shameless for one so young . " Come , " said Monsieur Georges abruptly . " Come and I will feed you . " As he said it he suddenly knew who she was and , as suddenly , regretted his invitation . " But , " he said , " are you not the little Gabrielle  --  the little . Gaby  --  the little daughter of that blemished old rascal who is called , with reason , Joseph , the Hairy One ? " She took no offense . " Yes , " she said , " but my father is very sick . I beg you to come up with me to speak to him . There is a neck-lace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested . " So the old scoundrel has stolen a necklace ? " " No , no , " she answered quickly ? " he did not steal it . He found it . " Monsieur Georges nodded his head approvingly . " Of course , " he said . " One always finds necklaces . That is one of the gifts the generous gods bestow upon us  --  the gift of being able to pluck necklaces out of the air or out of the gutter . I felicitate your horrible old father . " " Will you not come up and felicitate him in person ? " she asked . " He is so sick that he can not move . And , besides , he wishes to sell the necklace . It is worth a great many thousand francs , but we are starving . " " Starving ? " asked Monsieur Georges , and he took her by the arm and led her out to the sidewalk , where , under the blue-white light of a street lamp , he scrutinized her severely . " Yes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are . Come  --  lead me to the Hairy One , and I will look , not at him , if I can avoid it , but at his necklace . " She gave a little cry of relief and of thanks ; and he followed her up five flights of evil-smelling stairs . With a huge iron key she opened a narrow door and they came into a gas-lit room . In a corner , lying on a couch , Monsieur Georges beheld Joseph , the Hairy One . He was shaking from weakness or fever or , perhaps , fear ; and his long , untended white hair and his longer white beard straggled across his face and across the soiled pillow . He was not good to look upon . Monsieur Georges bade him a brusque good-evening and averted his eyes as quickly as possible . " Gaby tells me that you have a necklace you wish to sell , " he stated briefly . " Let me see it . " The Hairy One sat up on the couch , still shaking . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And it is not a stolen necklace . I swear on the head of my mother that . I found it on the sidewalk in front of the Casino de Paris , at the hour when the spectators were leaving the theater . " Monsieur Georges nodded his disbelief . " How fortunate ! " he said . " How fortunate that you should have been on the spot the very second that it dropped from the neck of some doubtless very beautiful woman . But , also , how unfortunate that you could n't possibly have returned it to her ! Show it to me . " At a word from her father , Gaby unlocked the upper drawer of a chest and took out a small package wrapped in a soiled newspaper . This she placed on a table , under the gas jet , and opened . Monsieur Georges advanced and leaned , without great interest , over the table . His lack of interest was not , however , of long duration . He saw a string of one hundred and thirty-three pearls  --  he counted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduated , and fastened with a clasp consisting of an emerald surrounded by small diamonds . He took the necklace reverently into his hand and raised it up to the unsteady light . And his hand , too , was unsteady . It was not a necklace for a queen or an empress or the wife of an American millionaire ; it would not have been conspicuous among the jewels of any remaining court ; it was not , even , of great enough value to have purchased outright a first-rate actress ; but it was , rather , the sort of necklace he had so often seen worn by respectable women of fair wealth and perfect taste ; such a necklace as , for example , Valentine Simonet might wear . He examined it carefully and closely , weighing it in his hand . He was an expert appraiser of all jewels , and his specialty , perhaps , was pearls . Presently he turned to face the Hairy One , whose eyes were eagerly upon him . " Yes , " he said slowly  --  and again ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you pick them often from the sidewalk ? I imagine not . " " I tell you , " cried the Hairy One querulously , " that it was not stolen . You have no right to insinuate that it was . " " No right , except that I know your habits  --  which , after all , are like mine , only of a smaller , meaner kind . For how much will you sell the necklace ? " " How much will you offer ? " demanded the Hairy One , the light of bargaining shining in his feverish little eyes . " It has value , " Monseiur Georges admitted , " but you will be unable to dispose of it to anyone but me . It has value , but it is not good bread and cheese and wine . Neither will it serve to pay the rent or to buy you shoes which , I perceive , you sadly need , my friend . I , myself , who have many connections , shall have difficulty in selling it  --  difficulty and danger . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time  --  perhaps , at most , two or three . I offer you five thousand francs for it . " The Hairy One cried out in unrighteous indignation . " You offer five thousand francs for that which is worth two hundred thousand ! " " Yes , " agreed Monsieur Georges placidly , " it is worth at least that  --  but not to you or even to me . Come , five thousand francs will go far with you . You might , if you were generous , buy Gaby a coat with it ; you might , if you were cleanly , have your hair and your beard trimmed ; you might , if you were honest , pay your rent , which is no doubt overdue ; and you might , if you were really sick , have in a doctor . And , granting that you did all those laudable things , you could still leave Gaby sufficient funds to pay for your simple but dignified funeral . Think it over , my friend . " The Hairy One regarded Monsieur Georges in bewildered anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accustomed to such rhetoric . But , notwithstanding , he knew well the value of what he had to sell and , knowing , he demanded ten thousand francs . Monsieur Georges did not shrug his shoulders , but he took a leather wallet from his breast pocket and counted out exactly seven one-thousand-franc notes , which he spread out in a row on the stained table cover . Then , with inquiring eyebrows , he turned to the Hairy One . The latter hesitated an instant , struggling no doubt with his cupidity . Then , without a word , he arose from his couch , stumbled to the table , and gathered up the seven notes with his unwashed right hand . Simultaneously Monsieur Georges casually dropped the necklace into the pocket of his coat . " Good-night , " said Monsieur Georges . " I recommend that you do not spend all of that money for cocaine . " Having delivered this excellent and gratuitous counsel , he left the Hairy One to his own vices . Now , when the Hairy One had protested that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , lied . He had , in truth , been on the spot when it fell from the slender , white throat of Madame Felix Simonet as she was about to enter a motor outside the Casino de Paris . It fell to the gutter where it lay , unheeded , for several seconds  --  a small fortune surrounded by half a hundred hungry people . But the Hairy One was the nearest and the most alert , and to him went the spoils . Madame Simonet remarked her loss only after several minutes . She clutched at her throat and called to the Deity . Then she called to her earthly father , the Prefect of Police of Paris , who sat beside her in the limousine . " Well , " he inquired , " what troubles you now , Valentine ? Have you , as usual , Lost or forgotten something ? " " Yes  --  my necklace . It is gone . We must go back at once to the theater . " The Prefect of Police made a sound like an indignant bark . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too much ! You will never recover it , my girl  --  never ! It is useless to return but , nevertheless , we will do so . It is truly unbelievable how you contrive to lose your possessions of value . You , the daughter of the Prefect of Police of Paris ! " The Prefect of Police of Paris had , as he would himself have said , reason . Nobody had reported a lost or found pearl necklace to the management of the theater . So the Prefect invited his daughter to accompany him to his widower 's apartment that they might discuss quietly what should be done . " As a beginning , " said the Prefect , " I am placed in a most ridiculous situation ; and , as you must know , it is only ridicule that puts an end to the career of a French statesman . A Prefect of Police of Paris may be a thief , an adulterer , even a murderer  --  indirectly of course  --  and still retain his position . But once Paris begins to ridicule its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , that it should become public knowledge that my daughter has again lost valuable jewelry ? and this time jewelry of great value . I do not desire to become the target ofall the revues and of all the smart song-makers . I am , in a way , France ; and France can be killed only by laughter . " He was rather proud of this short speech and noted mentally that the last phrase might , as it often had been , well be used in public . His daughter , however , paid him no attention at all . She was thinking not so much of the Third Republic as of her pearl necklace . " I shall put a notice in the newspapers , " she said , with apparent irrelevance . At that the Prefect of Police of Paris came close to insanity . Had the ceiling been lower he would have touched it with his uplifted hands . " Listen to me ! " he admonished her as soon as he could control his voice . " Listen to me ! Under no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my daughter , have been robbed  --  or careless  --  it amounts to the same . What will the private citizen think of his police protection if he once knows that the police can not protect even the daughter of their Prefect ? " This was , of course , a purely rhetorical question and , therefore , demanded no reply . However , Valentine said coolly , " I should dislike to see you be displaced from your position , but I should be very glad to get back my necklace . I know not which is the more important . " He urged her to be reasonable and he propounded many good reasons for reasonability . At length he said , " We will put a notice in the papers , but not under your name or mine . We will put a notice in the papers , offering a reward of ten thousand francs to the fortunate thief who has in his possession three hundred thousand francs of pearls  --  that is about what it cost , did it not ? " " Yes about . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the name of my assistant secretary  --  you know Hippolyte Mirval , do you not ? and we will represent him as offering the ten thousand francs ' reward if the necklace is returned to his apartment in the rue Weber . Do you approve  --  and have you the ten thousand francs ? " She answered the two questions affirmatively , and the Prefect sighed the relief of a long-suffering man . But before he left her at the door of her apartment house he said , " The necklace was undoubtedly stolen . If by any possible chance it should be presented we shall , of course , arrest the person presenting it . I shall take the requisite measures to have police at Mirval 's apartment and I shall name a day and an hour  --  next Thursday , shall we say , between seven and nine in the evening ? " " Must I be present ? " she asked , disturbed , for she took no pleasure in her father 's professional activities . " But naturally . You shall be forced to identify the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And ? " " And , quick , the handcuffs , " he concluded . " It is not fair , " she said . " You and your police make me a little ill . Suppose that the person who returns it is honest ? what then ? " " The supposition , " said the Prefect , " is impossible . An honest man would have returned it immediately to the office of the theater . We shall , I assure you , be dealing with a thief . " " You suspect everyone , " she murmured . " Yes , " he agreed , " it is for that the government pays me . " And so it came to pass that Monsieur Georges , awaking on Tuesday , the pearl necklace locked in his very private safe , read in Le Matin the following notice : " LOST : On Sunday night , probably outside the Casino de Paris , a pearl necklace . Reward of 10,000 francs and no questions asked if returned to M. Mirval , ee bis , rue Weber , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mirval had , somehow , a familiar ring  --  rather an unpleasant ring , but he was unable to account for it in his mind . He called to his little friend Kiki , who , for once , was in the bath tub . " Does the name of Mirval mean anything to you ? " lie shouted . Above the violent splashing of water he heard her answer , " No ! do n't lmow him ! Are you jealous again ? You exaggerate , my dear Georges . I tell you I have never seen or spoken to any such person . " " Stupid ! " he cried . " I ask you only if he belongs to the police . I care not at all whether or not he belongs to you . " " Oh ! " she said , and there followed a silence . She was evidently meditating in the tub . " I wish , " said Monsieur Georges , " that when you have finished making yourself so unusually clean , you would come here and discuss with me a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I come , " she called hack shrilly ; and she hastened , for she well knew that a matter of some importance meant , for Monsieur Georges , a matter of money , in which she had an ardent interest . She came from the bathroom , naked and scattering spray . " Mirval ? " she repeated ; " Mirval ? Yes , there is something decayed about that name . But I ca n't think why . Tell me , what have you to do with him ? Perhaps I shall remember . " " It concerns the pearl necklace , " Monsieur Georges explained . " He offers ten thousand francs for its return , and , supposedly , no questions asked . I am doubtful . " Kiki dried herself luxuriously with a huge bath towel and managed to scratch her head at the same time . " Yes , " she agreed , " I should go gently . Moreover , even if the Mirval person means what he says , you gain only three thousand francs on the transaction . " " What a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no errors in large figures . However , I am , as you well know , in danger so long as I have the necklace in my possession . Better , perhaps , three thousand francs than three years in jail . " She nodded . " But , " she advised , " I should he cautious . You may find yourself with three years of jail and without even the three thousand francs . " " That , " he said , " is why I asked you if the name of Mirval signified anything to your occasionally admirable brain . " Then abruptly he arose from the bed . " My clothes , " he commanded . " The blue suit and a white silk shirt . I am going down to the city . I have a magnificent idea . " She asked no questions . She knew by the look of him that he was " at work , " and she knew by experience that he liked no interference at such times . Instead , she aided and hastened his toilet . Kiki could often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street . In half an hour he was at the jewelry shop of Hecla in the Boulevard des Italiens ; and with him , in his pocket , was the pearl necklace . " It must be ready by Thursday afternoon at six o'clock , " were his final words to the manager . " I shall pass at that hour to take it  --  to take both of them . " " It will be ready and perfect , " the manager assured him ? " one as perfect as the other . " And so , at five minutes before six o'clock on the following Thursday , Monsieur Georges , dressed as for the opera , stopped at the shop of Hecla on the Boulevard des Italiens . He was outwardly calm but inwardly he was definitely worried . Kiki , who had helped him to dress , had perceived that , for once , the cherubic face of her man " was solemn . She blew , then , that Monsieur Georges was deliberately placing himself in danger ; but apart from that she knew nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was content to share , if not his confidence , at least his loot . From Hecla 's , Monsieur Georges , having retained his taxi-cab , drove to the Restaurant des Gauffres , where he dined wisely and well and alone . At half-past seven he arrived at the apartment of Monsieur Mirval , in the rue Weber . A valet opened the door for him , and he entered a modest salon . Monsieur Mirval rose from a chair to greet him . Monsieur Mirval was a small , anxious man who worried a small , black moustache . When he spoke , it was as if he were dictating to a stenographer . " You have come in answer to the advertisement of the lost pearl necklace ? " he inquired . Monsieur Georges scrutinized him very closely . " Yes , " he said , " precisely . " And then he asked , in a voice that was suddenly severe , " Who and what are you , Monsieur Mirval ? " It is possible that Monsieur Mirval did not know who or what he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auswered only after an interval . " Why , " be said , " I am the proprietor of the necklace which , I presume , you have found and are returning . " " Quite so , " said Monsieur Georges , and he drew a necklace of pearls carelessly from the pocket of his overcoat . " Is that the necklace you so unfortunately lost ? " he inquired mildly . " And , " he added , " if so , how does it happen that you were wearing pearls about your neck ? ? you who appear to be a manly man . " Monsieur Mirval blushed . " It goes without saying , " he explained , " that I represent my wife in this affair . " " In that case , " said Monsieur Georges , " I must insist that your wife identify the necklace before I surrender it and claim the reward . " " Very well , " said Monsieur Mirval , " I will summon her . " He went to a door that led into a corridor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simonet , the daughter of the Prefect of Police of Paris , came into the room and regarded Monsieur Georges with startled and questioning and beautiful eyes . Not often , in his reprehensible career , had Monsieur Georges found himself without a vocabulary fitted to the occasion . There may , perhaps , be found , now , an excuse for him , since he was confronting the woman whom he had once attempted to rob and later learned to trust . Trust ! No one but a fool , he told himself , should ever trust a woman . He looked at her in silence , crushed by the weight of his disappointment , unwilling to believe . " Ah ! " she cried , " Ah  --  ntais  --  I " and her lovely hands went to her throat as if to suppress further words . Monsieur Georges wondered what attitude she would adopt in this almost incredible situation . He had suspected a trap , and his suspicions had been confirmed ; but even his vivid imagination had not pictured Valentine Simonet as being one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told himself no , that it was impossible . And then he told himself yes , that anything was possible where a woman was concerned . He was very hurt and very bitter . And meanwhile Monsieur Mirval was explaining absurdly and awkwardly . " This gentleman , " said he , " has come to return your pearl necklace . He waits only to have you recognize it as your lost property and to receive the reward . The necklace is there , on the table . " This last was a waste of breath . The necklace was most conspicuously there , on the table . At last Monsieur Georges found words ; but he did not betray by any sign recognition of Madame Felix Simonet . On the contrary , he bowed and said , " I assume that I have the honor of addressing Madame Mirval. if Madame Mirval will be so kind as to regard and identify the necklace , I shall be glad to leave it . I need not assure you , I trust , that it was found , and not stolen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Casino de Paris on last Sunday night . I am delighted to be able to return it . " He spoke very graciously but he was on his guard . Valentine hesitated an instant . She seemed to be searching Monsieur Georges ' eyes for a hint as to what he would choose to have her say or do ; but there was nothing in his eyes to guide her one way or another . He was quite calm now  --  casual ; almost , she thought , amused . She said slowly , " Who ventured to tell you , monsieur , that I am Madame Mirval ? " " Your husband , himself , " said Monsieur Georges , with a wave of his hand in the direction of the assistant secretary . Then she flared up angrily , turned on the shrinking Mirval , and cried , " Some more of your police tricks ! Is it part of your duty to thrust on me your name  --  and yourself as a. husband ? I 'll have none of it . I am not Madame Mirval , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many people know , Madame Felix Simonet . " Monsieur Georges , unperturbed , bowed again . " In that case , " he said , " if Madame Simonet will be so kind as to identify her pearls ? " She took the necklace from the table and in silence regarded it . She looked at neither Monsieur Mirval nor Monsieur Georges , but she looked apparently at the pearls , counting them . There were precisely one hundred and thirty-three , and the clasp was an emerald surrounded by diamonds . Finally she spoke . " That is undoubtedly the necklace , " she said  --  calmly now . " Please pay the ten thousand francs ' reward to this exceedingly kind gentleman . At the same time I hope he will accept my thanks and forgive your deceitfulness . " Monsieur Mirval nodded knowingly and drew from a wallet ten thousand-franc notes . He presented them to Monsieur Georges and pressed at the same time an electric bell on his table . Monsieur Georges perceived the gesture , but did not move . Nor did he move in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior officers of his force . Instead , he held out his two hands . " Put on the handcuffs , Monsieur le Prefet , " he said . " I make no opposition to such complete imbecility , because one can not combat against it . I ask , only , with what crime do you charge me ? " " This is shameful , " said Valentine Simonet , " yes , monsieur , it is shameful . It is an outrage ! I had no idea ? " She slopped abruptly , suddenly aware that she had been warned what measures her father planned to take . But it was quite true that , at the time , she had no idea they would be taken against Monsieur Georges . And she dared not explain . The Prefect of Police maintained , as almost always , a dignified , disinterested manner . The handcuffs were locked upon the wrists of Monsieur Georges . " Very good , " said the Prefect . " I charge you of many crimes . I charge you first of being the Vicomte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name ; I charge you next with many thefts which we have been unable to place directly to your account ; and I charge you now with having stolen the necklace of my daughter . There is a value , there , of three hundred thousand francs . " Monsieur Georges laughed his bland laughter ; but not once did he look at Madame Simonet . " The Vicomte Georges de Chenavard ! " he exclaimed . " What a splendid , sonorous title ! I should feel honored to bear it , but unfortunately I can not claim a coat-of-arms . However , may I beg , merely as the humble thief which you likewise accuse me of being  --  may I beg to ask from whom your daughter , Madame Felix Simonet , obtained this necklace , which you value so optimistically at three hundred thousand francs ? " The Prefect of Police glanced with a confidently inquiring air at his daughter . " From my husband , " she said , with eyes averted . " Ile told me that he bought it at Dartier 's . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I ask the pardon of madame , " he said , " and I ask also that she look again , very closely , at the necklace . If she ! mows anything of pearls she will know that the necklace is not from Dartier and that the pearls are false . You have paid me ten thousand francs for returning a necklace of artificial pearls which I value at one thousand . Then you have endeavored to put me in jail on imaginary pretexts . My only crime -- if you call it a crime  --  is that I was willing to accept an exorbitant reward for a necklace which I knew to be false , but which your daughter identified as her own and which you were both foolish enough to believe real . I trust that you understand what a contemptible trick you have played in luring an honest man into your house  --  or , rather , into the house of Monsieur Mirval , your accomplice  --  by the offer of a reward . You have even gone to the laughable length of passing off your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , monsieur . Then , with the gesture of the stage police-officer , you step from behind the arras , where you have been in hiding like Polonius , and you valiantly clap the handcuffs on the wrists of a person who has sought only to do you a favor . I think , Monsieur le Prefet , that you have outdone yourself on this occasion , and I congratulate you in the name of all Parisians who are fond of hearty laugh- ? ter . Come , let us go to the jail ! " The Prefect of Police looked at his daughter , and then they both looked at the necklace . And then they looked doubtfully at . each other . The Prefect , faced once more with the threat of the ridicule of all Paris , commenced an orderly retreat . " One can not , " said he reluctantly , " arrest a man who returns a necklace of artificial pearls , and who admits that it is artificial . Are you certain , Valentine , that it is your own ? " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all certain . " " In your opinion , " demanded the Prefect , indignant with cause , " in your opinion is this your necklace or not ? " " In my opinion , " she replied , " it might well be a perfect imitation of my real necklace . " Monsieur Georges bowed . " Madame , " he said , " with my aid , you will yet be a cannaisseuse . " If she smiled at him , it was an uncomprehending , interrogatory smile . " I have not had your experience with precious jewels , " she said . The Prefect , becoming impatient and feeling that he was risking his dignity , spoke with his official voice . " There has been , possibly , a misunderstanding . We will give this young man one thousand francs and we will retain the necklace . We will have an expert examine it . If it actually proves to be false , why then  --  why then , Valentine , your sacred husband who gave it to you is even more of a miserable scoundrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pardon , " said Monsieur Georges . " The necklace is worth one thousand  --  yes . But my trouble and my expenses and my reward ? " " Two thousand in all , " said the Prefect , " and I trust I never see you again . " " I trust not , " said Monsieur Georges gravely . " But I shall have you watched , " added the Prefect . " You honor me , " said Monsieur Georges . They took from the table eight of the ten thousand francs , leaving him the remaining two ; and they took from his wrists the handcuffs . Then they led him to the door and allowed him to depart .
