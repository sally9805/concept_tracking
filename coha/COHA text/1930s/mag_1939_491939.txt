E DDIE POWERS dropped in a few Sundays past and stayed to talk of tunnels and those who build them . A bard little man , Powers . He deals in facts . " I hear you were laid up with the bends for two weeks , " I said . " A lie , " said Powers . " I was laid up for a week and six days only . " " The newspapers claim there were forty eases at the tunnel in one week . " " Another lie , " said Powers . " It was thirty-eight cases , no more . " - There was no use to dispute his figures . Instead , I listened quietly while he told of things that were happening beneath the East River . Strange things , most of them . They belonged in the realm of fiction . But they were fact . I 'd worked under that same river ten years ago with Powers , and I knew . He told of two ancient anchors that had been found deep in the river mud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dutch ship when New York was New Amsterdam . Powers did n't say they had . He merely said they were old  --  very old . And he told of the skull of a steer with horns that measured almost six feet across . This , too , had been found in the river bottom . How did it get there ? Powers did n't know . He did n't make guesses . He simply told me what he had seen . It was pleasant to listen , but I could find nothing to write . I 'd told the story of the river tunnels in a SATURDAY EVENING POST article a few years ago . And the tunnels do n't change . Men do n't change either . Powers was just as I always had known him . While we were talking , I ventured the thought that I could step back into the tunnels and pick up my trade even though I had been away for ten years . " Maybe you could , " said Powers doubtfully . " Maybe you could , but I would n't bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why not ? " " It 's on account of that guy Jones , " he said . " Remember Eddie Jones ? " " Used to be shop foreman , did n't he ? " " Used to be , " said Powers . " He 's master mechanic on this job . " From the Bottom Up AS AGE is figured under the river beds , Eddie Cl Jones is only a youngster . Still in his early thirties . True , he 's worked on a dozen tough jobs . Any river tunnel is tough . But this Queens Midtown Tunnel from New York to Long Island City is a brute . " Who put Jones in as master mechanic ? " I asked him . " Harry Redwood . He 's general super on the job . " Harry Redwood is the dean of all tunnel builders . He 's good . When he goes on a job , the best men in the country come running , and if Harry needed a master mechanic , he could have had his choice . " What made Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tact and he was choosing his words . " Harry needed the best in the trade , " he said slowly . That called for questions . The master mechanic on a river tunnel is second in command to the general superintendent . His mistakes are paid for with men 's lives . And if Eddie Jones was really the best in the trade , I wanted proof . " I 'll give it to you , " said Powers . He told me of a now personality that had come into the trade and was shaping things with a mechanic 's hands . That guy Jones had left school in his early teens to work in one of the Erie Railroad shops . While he was there , construction started on the Holland Tunnel . Eddie Jones spent his lunch hour watching the spouting geyser on the Hudson River that marked the spot where gangs of sand hogs were driving a heading . He wondered about the compressed air that came bubbling and frothing to the surface . Wondered about the men who breathed it and about the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job on a shovel , and was told to run along home to his mother . Building tunnels is a man 's trade . He tried the machine-shop foreman and was given a chance at a lathe . He ran it well and was put to work . He was closer to the tunnel now . He could look out of the shop window and watch the boils dancing on the river . Gangs of men went past the door on their way to the shafts . The company hospital was near by and he saw many of those same men being carried from the tunnel . Some had no legs . Some had no arms . Others went down the shaf is and did n't come back . And there were stories of the river flooding into the tunnel to trap and kill the miners as they worked . Eddie Jones wondered about all this , but he kept to his work in the machine shop . Before the tunnel was completed , he bad become shop foreman . Still , he worked on top  --  the shop was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of building tunnels is done deep down under the mud . And this is a place for heavy-chested men who can work in air pressures of forty and more pounds to the square inch . It is n't a 1 place for kids . A Subway Scholar IDDIE followed his new trade to Brooklyn , where L.4 I was working as a pipe fitter in Powers ' gang . We were building one of the tunnels for the Eighth Avenue Subway , and you may recall it was this job I mentioned in the POST article . But I did n't mention Eddie Jones . He was n't important . Ile was a good mechanic , but still we considered him a kid . Perhaps it was because of his manner . fle was tall and thin and very quiet . Not a good mixer and not much in a drinking bout . Eddie spent most of his spare time on the end of the dock , Sometimes he watched the frothing white water and sometimes he studied books on engineering and draftsmanship . The men called him a queer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that job . A mean one . But we finished the tunnel and moved on to the next section , at Jay Street on the Brooklyn water front . Then something happened to the master mechanic and there was n't a. man available to take his place . No one seems to recall just what had happened  --  an accident of some sort , or perhaps the river came in . But he was gone and his job wits open . Eddie Jones went to see 0 . B. Montgomery , who was general superintendent of the tunnels . Another quiet man . He carried a title that . is strange in the trade . The sand hogs called him " Mr. Montgomery . " " Something you want , Eddie ? " asked Montgomery . " Yes , sir , " said Jones . " I want to be master mechanic . " Montgomery pointed to a chair . " Have you ever been in compressed air ? " " No , sir . " " Do you know what it can do to a man ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's killed some . " " It 's killed hundreds , " said Montgomery . " I 've worked on jobs where the death rate was twenty-five per cent . One man in every four , Eddie . " " That 's bad , " said Jones . " Very bad , " said Montgomery . " Between the river and the air , building tunnels is n't a particularly easy trade . " ( Continued on Page 66 ) " I 'd still like to be master mechanic . " The general super shrugged . " All right , Eddie ; that 's your new job . " There was plenty of talk that day . The sand hogs were puzzled by Montgomery 's choice , but they did n't question it . The general super held the same place in the trade that Harry Redwood holds today . He was tops . And his word was law . Eddie Jones went to work as master mechanic and Powers took him down for his first trip into compressed air . I went with them , and in the telling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Powers does when he talks of the tunnels . A small elevator took us to the foot of the shaft and Eddie looked at the concrete bulkhead that spanned the tunnel mouth . In it were three air locks  --  a large one for the muck cars , a smaller one for the men , and close under the roof of the tunnel was the emergency lock . Powers pointed to it . When the river comes in , do n't wait , to see if the water is wet , " he said . " Run like hell and crawl into that lock . " It was the usual introduction to the tunnel . Then we stepped into the man lock and Powers closed the heavy iron door behind us . He showed Jones how to pinch his nose and force air into his head passages . " Open ' er up , " said Powers to the lock tender . The pressure came in and heat came with it . Eddie Jones gulped and his eyes were wide . He did n't say anything and soon the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The inner door was opened and . lones walked down to look at his first heading . A half dozen muckers ben t , stripped to the waist. , above a pile of sand at the track ends . Beyond them the miners were cutting the stuff away fast , and their helpers were sending it out to be loaded . Huge Negroes swung their wrenches to tighten the bolts of the east-iron tunnel lining . They sang as they worked , and the red lead that dripped from the bolts daubed their dark backs with long streaks of color . Sand.Hog Baptism It was muscle work . Shovels , picks , sledges and wrenches were the only tools flexible enough to be used under the East River . The heading was a place for a man with the proverbial strong back and weak mind . Three years on a seventy-five-pound wrench would burn out an iron man . A mucker might last four . But that was the way of the trade . It had always been so . Life was lived quickly in the black tubes where air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . And Eddie Jones was breathing it for the first time . His body was saturated with it , and perhaps he was wondering if he would limp , like others he had seen who 'd worked in the tunnels , " There 's the shield , " said Powers . " Looks different down hero , do n't it , Jones ? " Jones did n't answer . He was looking at the huge cylinder of steel that is the heart and life of the heading . The tunnel was seventeen feet in diameter and the tail of the shield fitted snugly about the forward end , as one drinking glass will do when it is set within another . But this glass had no bottom . Or rather , as it was pointed into the wall of sand at the heading , it might be better to say it had no forward end . It was cross braced with a heavy platform that served as a working place for the miners . Upright partitions cut it into pockets and sand streamed from the lower set . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All you 've got to do is keep it running until the job is over . " That was only part of the story . Jones knew the rest . As master mechanic he was in charge of every piece of machinery below the river and on the riverbank . The powerhouse was his responsibility . It was there the compressed air was started on its journey through the long black pipes to the heading . Hydraulic pressure up to six thousand pounds per square inch was made at the powerhouse too . It was needed to move the shield forward into the muck when we made a " shove . " But Jones knew all this . He 'd been over every piece of machinery aboveground and knew it thoroughly . And no doubt he also recalled failure of the compressors had trapped thirty men in a flooded heading on a former job . fin Underground Commander He stared at the shield . Powers looked at me and shook his head . Jones was only a kid , It was a desperate chance to work in a tunnel with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gang depended upon that shield . Trusted their lives to it . The forward edge extended outward at the top . It served as a shelter beneath which the miners could work . There were sliding platforms hero too . They held the wall of planked sand erect when the shield was moved forward . Delicate things . A few days previous one of them had jammed when a shove was made It punched a hole in the river bed and buried a miner . We never found him . Tons of air pressure had driven him far into the mud . Jones walked into the center pocket .. He looked up at the jack that had jammed . He suggested a change be made in the mechanism . Powers listened attentively . He 'd been in the tunnels for years and had kept alive by listening to good advice . " Not a bad idea , " he said at length . " We 'll fix that tomorrow . " " You 'll fix it today , " said Jones . It was his first order . There were more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces of machinery came into the headings to make the work safer . The sand hogs mistrusted the machinery . They mistrusted Jones . He 'd put men out of work . Put machines in the tunnels to take the places of sand hogs . He was a fool . A crazy kid with crazy ideas . Books could n't teach a man to build tunnels . That took years of work beneath the river . Jones sent more machinery into the tunnels , Some of it worked . Some of it did n't . The men grumbled and found fault . I was one who took a real pleasure in proving a belt conveyor was impractical . I sent it out . Jones sent it in again . And then the accident rate started to slip . The work went faster . When the job was ended , a new EVENING POST through the mud and rips a hole in the river bed . That is a blow  --  the most dreaded of all tunnel accidents . Men and materials are swept along with the exploding air and whirled into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floods into the tunnel , and hard luck runs with the sand hog who is late to the emergency lock . Entire gangs have been lost in blows . So much for the seventeen-foot tunnel . Now double that . Figure the extra pressure at the top of a thirty-two-foot job . And then you have real trouble . Add to it the fact that the bed of the East River is the dumping ground of the last ice age and you have more trouble . There is rock down there , and sand and mud and hardpan and gravel and silt . There are boulders the size of a man 's head and boulders the size of a ten-ton truck . Old ships and barges have settled through the mud and lie in wait for the tunnel builders . Trunks of trees and dock spiles , barge loads of pipe and the hulks of ancient sailing vessels form part of the mystery that is the bed of the East River . Is it any wonder that other contractors said the low-bid outfit was welcome to the job ? Welcome or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Harry Redwood to build the tunnel . Then it was up to Harry to find a master mechanic who could devise a shield to protect the sand hogs at work in that graveyard . One that would drive through anything they might find below the river . And Harry sent for Eddie Jones . He was older now . But he still looked like a youngster . Tall and quiet and very wide-eyed . He came and talked with Harry . He talked with the engineers who would build the four monstrous shields . He made suggestions . Advised changes that were a far cry from the old days . The engineers were doubtful . Harry Redwood stood behind the man he had picked and the shields were built . The Toll of the Ricer Rock drillers went to work . The shafts were sent down . Two shields were assembled and moved into place on the New York side . Bulkheads were built across the mouths of the tunnels and compressed air flowed into the headings . Eddie Jones was starting the most difficult job of river tunneling that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old-timers were willing to bet oven money it could n't be finished . Powers was one of the few who agreed that the new shields might work . He did n't say they would . He simply said they might . And as hydraulic foreman under Jones , it was his job to send them beneath the river . He and his men would be the mechanics who would drive those shields . Trust their lives to them . The work started nicely . No accidents and no deaths . Then the air pressure was increased , as the headings crept farther under the East River . It went up fast . And the old plague of the sand hogs came to the tunnels . Men started to double up with pains in their legs and arms . Some dropped as they left the subways to walk to their homes . Ambulances and radio cars gathered them up and rushed them back to the tunnels . The bends , chokes , staggers and paralysis  --  all of the many compressed-air ailments came to the sand hogs who worked beneath the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men accepted it as such . They went into the medical locks , were recompressed and held in gradually decreasing pressure until the nitrogen bubbles dissolved and the bends were cured . The Government sent supplies of helium to aid in the fight , trying a cure that had been found effective when Navy divers were stricken with like ailments . The contractors supplied oxygen masks for use in the decompression chambers . The skill of the medical world was called upon . But the sand hogs said , " Wait ! The river has n't made its move yet . This is only the air . Wait ! " Through Fire and Water They were old in the trade . And they knew . It had always happened before and it would happen again . Today , tomorrow , any hour of the week . The East River was patient , but eventually it would make its move . And it did . There is no work in the tunnel on Sunday , but a watch gang of four men is left to keep constant cheek upon the heading . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They did n't wait to be relieved by the incoming men . Perhaps one of them dropped a cigarette . Perhaps a wire was short-circuited . Perhaps any one of a dozen things happened . No one will ever know . But fire started in the tunnel . Fed by the compressed air , it swept along the wooden flooring . There were no men in the heading to fight it . In five minutes it was beyond control . The incoming gang slammed the iron lock door closed against a wave of heat that poured up the tunnel . They decompressed quickly and passed the word that fire was at work under the river . Eddie Jones was notified . He hurried to the shaft to find Harry Redwood arguing with a group of firemen . The city fire fighters wanted to go in , but Redwood insisted they must first be tested by the company doctors , Fighting fire is one thing , but going into compressed air is something else again . The officials agreed and a dozen huskies were tested . Six were found to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to put out the fire , are you ? " said Powers . That brought a laugh from the sand hogs . Powers is a veteran of other fires . He knows the answers . He looked at Jones and the master mechanic winked . Then Redwood gave the word and they started down . " Better put on a mask , " said a fireman . " No , thanks , " said Powers . " It might get in my way when I start to run . " The elevator stopped at the bottom of the shaft and Harry Redwood led the way to the man lock . Tunneling is that kind of a trade . The general superintendent and the master meehanio do n't send men into a flaming tunnel . They lead them in . " Your last chance to go back , " said Powers to the firemen . " We 're not going back , " said one . Powers grinned . " You may be closer to right than you think . " He closed the heavy lock door and Harry Redwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It grew with each pound of pressure . Powers swears a thermometer would have registered 140 degrees when the inner door swung open . I went through one tunnel fire with him , and I 'm willing to ( Continued ? rs Page 70 ) EVENING POST ( Continued from Page 70 ) to sit in a rowboat and direct the work of reclamation . " Tough luck , " said Powers . " Not so bad , " said Jones . " We did n't lose a man . " That was something new . Change had come to the trade of the sand hog . There was talk at the shaft heads and talk in the locker rooms . I heard it from a group of old-timers when I stopped in the other day to say hello . Within a few months the tunnel had gone through a fire and two floods . The men had taken them as part of the day 's work . There had been other fires and other floods . Men had been crippled and men had been killed . Dozens of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not on the toughest . job of river tunneling that . had ever been attempted . They had n't lost a man . " A great guy , that Eddie Jones , " said a heavy-chested miner . " Yeah , a great guy , " said another . " He certainly built a shield . " The Machine lige I found him in his office , heading over a pile of blueprints . He had n't changed much in ten years . When I asked him about the job , he looked toward a window and pointed to a dancing bubble of white water on the river surface . It was out beyond the dock end , and another was creeping to meet it from the Long Island side of the river . " We 're ahead of schedule now , " said Jones . " We 'll finish that way too . " " Suppose the river comes in again ? " " I 'm not worried about the river , " said Eddie Jones . " We 've got . that licked . " I was willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd done it . We went to the shaft and rode down to the tunnel level . There were steel safety gates on the elevator car . A gang of sand hogs came out of a man lock , and they were wearing helmets . Each of them had a hello for Eddie Jones as they passed . The men at the muck locks spoke to him too . Some were old-timers with whom I had driven tunnel . Men who had been burned out by the " sweat-and-muscle " driving of the old days . But they were still doing a man 's job and drawing pay . An electric motor was providing the power that used to come from their backs . Sending the muck cars along at a faster pace . February 25 , Inside the tunnel I found a new world . The muck pile was gone . The muckors were gone . In their places were huge machines that lifted the sand and hurried it into waiting ears . Jones pointed to a belt conveyor . " It works , " lie said to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who used to swing the shovels ? " I asked . " They 're all here . " I counted the gang . More men were working than ever before . But they were doing a better job . A faster job , They were working at a speed that made it practical and sensible to build more tunnels . Longer ones . " Think you could run that shield ? " asked Jones . The Bata ( ' to Come He pointed to the monstrous cylinder at the tunnel end . Its face was a maze of pipes and spindles and levers and dials . A miner in the heading called for a supporting jack , and I watched the shield driver open a valve . The steel rani moved out and settled firmly against the wall of planks . Another followed . " I guess I 've seen enough , " I said wearily . I wanted to get out of that heading . It was n't the tunnel I 'd known . We went to the surface and walked toward Jones ' office . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But we 've got a long way to go before we 're through . " He was looking toward the company hospital when he spoke . A group of sand hogs were helping a man from a taxi . His legs were doubled against his stomach and his face was gray . He had the bends . But this , too , has always been part of the day 's work in a tunnel . Hundreds of men get the bends . ? . " Something has to be done about that , " said Jones . " We have n't licked the air yet . But we will , Chase  --  we will . " I doubted it , and was about to say so . Then I recalled a day when a wide-eyed kid had given his first order in an East River tunnel , That was less than ten years ago , when a flooded tunnel usually meant a heavy lass to the contractor and the lives of a dozen sand hogs , " Perhaps you 're right , " I said , " I know I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop a guy like that , even if he is still in his early thirties .
