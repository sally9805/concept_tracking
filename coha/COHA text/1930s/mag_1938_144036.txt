Francisco Franco , again busy over staff maps with his big soft pencil , directed last week the Rightist recapture of Teruel , bloody " Spanish Verdun . " Inside this little city , Valentin Gonsalez , a picturesque Leftist Army leader known as El Campesino ( " The Peasant " ) , was busy dynamiting such civic buildings as were not already in ruins , while the 20,000 Leftists holding Teruel clung grimly to their posts . <P> " House-to-house fighting is the enemy 's style , not ours , " General Franco told correspondents . " That is just what they want , but we are not going to oblige them because we can always prove our superiority in the open battlefield , and we do not have to take Teruel their way . " <P> Rightist columns by this time had completely surrounded Teruel . Rightists poured in explosives , made things hotter in the town than any place has been in Spain since the Siege of the Alcazar . The Peasant , leading Leftists in a furious effort to fight their way out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then bayonet against bayonet in what experts rated the most savage , large-scale battle of Spain 's present civil war . <P> Two days later the official results were announced . According to the Leftist Government : their forces had withdrawn from Teruel in perfect order and taken up strong positions nine miles back . According to General Franco : 16,000 Leftists had been taken prisoner , 9,000 buried . Striking an average , neutrals guessed that the Leftists had given a good account of themselves , had succeeded in fighting their way out with heavy losses . <P> The Leftist Government immediately ordered two more classes to the colors . Each man drafted was ordered to " bring to the People 's Army a pair of shoes , blanket , plate , knife , fork and spoon . " The Leftist surprise offensive on Dec. 19 , which captured Teruel , was the first major victory of the new People 's Army . In canceling that victory last week General Franco did not himself win a major victory . For the expenditure of two months ' time many lives and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to show was a wider Teruel salient ( now containing 2,500 square miles against 2,125 square miles three months ago ) . <P> It has been clear almost from the start that forces outside Spain would decide this civil war . Last week the fall of Teruel happened to coincide with a general realization among Spaniards that Chamberlain , Hitler , Chautemps and Mussolini are now dickering toward a four-power agreement ( see col. 2 ) . Its effect would be to rule out any victory in Spain for the extreme Left-Communists , Anarchists and the more radical Socialists . General Franco 's friends in Britain have always maintained he was ready for a " reasonable Spanish compromise , " and with Hitler and Mussolini now telling Chamberlain they want not a square inch of Spanish soil , this week , for the first time in 19 months , peace in Spain became possible .
