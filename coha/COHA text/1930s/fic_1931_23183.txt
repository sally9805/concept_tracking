BOW DOWN , ISAAC 1 A STORY BY CONRAD AllaN I MADE my first visit to Hackiey Falls when I was twelve years old . My mother had died in that year , and my widowed father could think of no better thing to do with me in the school holidays than to send me to visit my two maiden aunts , Julia and Jenny ( his elder sisters ) who still lived on the family farm , where he himself had been born ; and it was here that he had met and married my mother . It was natural enough that he should send me to " Witch Elms " ; and I confess that , after a childhood almost all of which had been spent in New York , I looked upon the adventure as a treat . My father impressed upon me that I should have to be helpful -- -I was given a clear understanding , in strictest New England fashion , of my duties . I was to get the mail twice a day , to fetch the kindling , to go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jenny , to help old Jim with the livestock ? which merely meant chivying the one cow to and from the pasture , or feeding the two pigs which lived in the barn cellar  --  and to keep my room tidy . If I was very good I might be allowed to drive the horse now and then . And I could help Jim pump the water up to the tank in the attic , which was done by hand . All of these things I did and , surprisingly enough , did n't find them in the least like duties . I was happier than I 'd ever been in nay life . With a farm of two hundred acres to run over , with woods to explore , the Mill River to bathe in , and mountains to climb  --  and summer , too , just beginning  --  it may be assumed that I did n't find things very irksome , " Witch Elms " stood in the midst of a green valley-meadow , about a quarter of a mile from the river , which we could see from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this point by means of an old-fashioned covered bridge , which was painted a raw scarlet : some of the planking was gone from its floor , and I used to love to lie on my belly and look down at the shallow brawling water , in which one could see every pebble and minnow . Beyond the bridge rose Hateful Mountain , covered with sugar-maples , and along the flank of this the road climbed steeply eastward , eventually , after a mile or so , passing the white farmhouse ( perched quite high on a spur of Hateful ) which belonged to Captain Phippen , who was a distant connection of ours , and our only frequent visitor . He had been a sea captain , in the coastwise trade , and now lived with his son and daughter-in-law . He could almost invariably be seen on his porch with a powerful spyglass in his hand  --  he used to tell me that with that spyglass he knew everything that was done in the valley . He knew just which orchard Jim was picking , and how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twinkle in his eye ) to know the size of the apples . He once told me that in summer , if the light was just right , and the church windows were open in Hackley Falls , he could tell whether the Crazy Willards put ten cents or a nickel into the offertory box ; but this I knew was apocryphal . I had looked many times through the spyglass myself , and knew that all one could see of the little white town of Hackley Falls was the church steeple , with a golden fish for a weather vane , and the little red cupola of the grammar school , with a black bell in it . Elms and maples completely hid the rest of the town ; and in fact , from Captain Phippen 's porch , as from our own , the only other human habitation which could be seen was the Crazy Willards ' , which stood halfway between our house and Hackley Falls  --  about a mile and a half westward  --  and ( looking from " Witch Elms " ) on the opposite side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonial farmhouse , which must at one time have been rather fine , but was now collapsing with neglect and old age and black as pitch with rain-rot . Through Captain Phippen 's glass one could make out easily enough the untrimmed trumpet-vine , which covered the western gable with scarlet blossom , and the foul cow-yard which adjoined the house on the east . One could also see the horns of the cattle over the unpainted fence . . . . But I am getting ahead of my story , for this sinister house is really my theme . With a small boy 's love of the abnormal  --  haunted houses , demon-murderers , crime , violence , and so on  --  it is not unnatural that the Willard farm should from the first have fascinated me . Nothing , for example , could have kindled my imagination about it more than the fact that I was from the outset warned against it . It was on my very first drive from Hackley Falls to " Witch Elms " that old Jim had first called my attention to the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folded whip . " See that ? " And on my assenting , he added , " Keep away from there . That 's the Crazy Willards ' . Old Crazy Willard . " He chewed tobacco slowly , not turning his face towards the house . looked at it , and it seemed then harmless enough . " Who 's Crazy Willard ? " I asked . " He 's the very devil . The very devil himself in flesh ! If you touched him with a wet finger , it would hiss . " This metaphor so impressed me at the time that I made no further inquiry . Too much had been presented to me all at once ; and it was some days before I myself , one evening at milking-time , when Jim was squirting the warm white froth into a resonant pail , his knees under Lemon 's belly , again brought up the subject . I had passed the house daily  --  eying it across the little river , of course  --  but had only once seen any sign of life there . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonnet , who was rather fiercely raking the grass on the front lawn or yard and who , seeing me ( I was taking home the mail ) , had turned for a moment , resting her hands on the rake handle , and shot at me a look of discomfiting intensity . I at once pretended that I was merely looking at the river . " What does Old Crazy Willard look like ? " I said . " And why is he crazy ? " Jim took so Iong to answer me that I thought he was n't going to answer me at all . His rusty old bowler hat was tilted back on his forehead by Lemon 's belly , and he chewed his cud of tobacco . The tiny white threads of milk shot into the pail on alternate sides , sping  --  spong  --  sping  --  spong , and Lemon now and then tossed her head to shake off flies . " Why is he crazy ? " Sping  --  spongsping  --  spong . " Well , I guess because the Lord meant him to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Who is Lydia ? " " Lydia ? She 's his daughter . " I reflected on this . " But what does he look like ? " " Well , he 's tall and white-haired and kind of stringy , and lie has a lot of teeth . " " Does he do crazy things ? " " You leave your mind off him , Billy . " " Well , but does he ? " " He 's crazy for religion . They all three are . They sing hymns , mornin ' , noon , and night . " " Oh . " " You listen when you go by  --  you 'd think they was having conniption fits . And sometimes they are . .. . He 's a powerful hand with a whip . " " A whip ? " My puzzled question fell unanswered , except by the singsong of the milk in the pail . My aunts were as nice as they could be . I think they did n't know much about children  --  or small boys  --  and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes till late at night . What fantastic conclusions they reached , heaven only knows ! They were very much alike  --  in fact , at first I could n't tell them apart . They both wore spectacles and both had thin , white , kindly faces ; they dressed in black , with lace over their shoulders , parted their hair severely in the middle , and had bright blue eyes . It was a day or two before I knew that Aunt Julia was the one who had gray hair and usually folded her hands as she talked . She was very gentle . Aunt Jenny was plumper , stuck out in front a little more , had a loud sudden laugh like a man and an aggressive sense of humor . Except to church on Sundays , when Betsy the mare was harnessed to theold closed carriage , and Jim wore a special coat , not quite so green with age as his other , and once a month to tea at the Minister 's , and about as often to Captain Phippen 's , they never went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only occasionally going to the barn for an official inspection . Now and then , if there happened to be a " special sunset , " they would take me with them to the upper orchard , from which one had a fine view right along the valley to the west , where one could see the notched mountains against the sun . But this was seldom ; and they did it gravely , as if it were a kind of religious duty . It was on such an occasion , as we stood by a fallen apple tree which , though half broken through at the ground , still continued annually to blossom and bear , and as we watched the sunset fading in the curves of the Mill River , that I first heard the Willards mentioned by my aunts . At that hour and in that light the Willard farm was unusually conspicuous . It stood very black and square and alone against the western light , and even at that distance it looked forlorn and deserted . From where we stood we could see also the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road . And it was Aunt Julia who first noticed that someone was crossing the river . " There he goes now , " she said . " Who ? " " Old Isaac . I wish he 'd fall in and drown . " " He 'd do well to drown in Mill River ! " I could just make out on the footbridge the figure of a man , who seemed to be carrying something in one hand . " What 's he carrying , Aunt Jenny ? " " Keg of hard cider , most likely . " " There 'll be hymn-singing to-night , I guess . " " And more than that . " " What does he do ? " I asked . Aunt Jenny gave Aunt Julia a quick look , not meant for me . " He beats time , " she said . And then added , " With a razor-strop . " " Jim said it was a whip . " " Well , I guess he is n't particular . It might even be a broomstick . Anyway , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a quick laugh . " And then Lydia keeps out of sight for a while . " I wanted to ask questions , feeling that something queer was behind all this , but at that moment , as the best of the sunset was over , my aunts , picking up their long skirts , began to retrace their steps toward the house , and nothing further was said . In fact , though the Crazy Willards were seldom far from my mind , and though I never went out without hoping , or half hoping , to meet Isaac , I made no further discoveries about them until several weeks later , when I had walked up to Captain Phippen 's to take him a present of gingerbread from Aunt Julia . Long before I had climbed the hill ( it was a very hot day ) I could see him in his usual rocking-chair , with his feet against the porch-rail and his spyglass at his eye . He watched me climb , and when I arrived at last he told me that he had been counting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " I am ! " " Well , sit down on your hunkers and rest . Do n't tell me your Aunt Julia is sending me more gingerbread ! That woman will be the death of me . " I sat down and presently was allowed to look through the precious glass , and of course instantly turned it on the Willard farm . " I 'm looking at the Willard farm , " I said . " Well , I 'd be careful , if I was you . " " I can see two great big sea shells by the front door . " " If that 's all you can see , " he said , chuckling , " you 're a lucky boy . " " Does old Isaac beat Lydia ? " " What made you think that ? " " Something Aunt Jenny said . " " Well , I du n no , I du n no , maybe he does . " " Is she bad ? " " Maybe she was . She ran away once with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? " " Perhaps she did . " " And what happened then ? " " Old Isaac went and brought her back again . . . . You 'll understand it when you 're older . " " And did he beat her ? " " Yes , he beat her . " Captain Phippen 's face had become grim . " Your aunts happened to be driving by  --  I would n't be surprised if they did n't save her life ! They went in with Jim and stopped him . " " Oh. , , " And now we 'll talk about ginger-bread . " Of course I did n't dare ask my aunts about that scene , much as I burned with curiosity . The whole thing seemed to me such a queer mixture of things  --  the beatings and the hymn-singings and the drinking  --  that I could n't in the least fathom it . As a result of a few hints to Jim , while driving Lemon to and from the hill-pasture , or passing the Willards on our way to Hackley Falls for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally with a " There 's the Willards ' , is n't it ? " ) I added a new small item or two , but nothing of great importance . Apparently they were very poor and made only a bare living by selling milk and butter . Old Isaac was a tyrant . He made his wife and Lydia do all the work , while he himself got drunk night after night , slept it off in the morning , and read the Bible all afternoon . He had a violent temper , and at such times went purple in the face . Onee he had gone into the post office , and accused the postmaster , Mr. Greene ( who also ran the general store ) of reading his mail . The fight which ensued was of epic splendor . Isaac had jumped over the counter and grabbed Greene by the throat . They had catapulted all over the store , knocking down boxes of shoes , upsetting glass cases full of cheap candy , wrapping themselves in ladies ' muslin dresses , and finally had both rolled right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut his right forearm so badly that it had to have seven stitches . Eye-witnesses said that Isaac 's face was the color of an eggplant . For some strange reason , there had been no arrest ; and later on Isom ' had walked in one afternoon ( when sober , I suppose ) and publicly apologized and walked out again . It was still considered the best fight Hackley Falls had ever seen . Isaac , although fifteen years older than Mr. Greene , had had all the hst of it  --  everybody had marvelled at his strength . I never went into the store for the mail without hoping that Mr. Greene might , by some chance , have his right sleeve rolled up , so that I could see the scar , but he never did . I imagine he was n't too proud of it . Nevertheless , and not so long after my talk with Captain Phippen , it was thanks to Mr. Greene that I made the first of my only two actual visits to the Willard farm . I had walked down one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had got the tight fragrant paper bag under my arm and paid for it , Mr. Greene looked at me appraisingly over his glasses . He was holding a letter in his hand . " Billy , " he said , " I guess you 'd be a good messenger . I 'll give you ten cents to deliver this letter to Isaac Willard . What do you say ? " " Sure ! " " Are you going right back ? " " Sure ! " " All right . " He gave me the letter and the ten cents , and I started out almost at a run . It was too good to be true . I had seen at once , by the long blue stamp with a picture of a messenger boy on it , that it was a special-delivery letter  --  though heaven knows why old Isaac should be getting a special delivery . It came from Bennington , Vermont , and there was a name in the upper lefthand corner of it , but I ca n't remember what it was . Anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I got there ? Should I hear the whip or the razor-strop going or screams ? It even occurred to me , naturally , that I might have to cut and run for it myself : it might be one of the days when the old man looked like an eggplant . And had Mr. Greene sent the letter by me because he was afraid to take it him-self ? That was a disquieting thought and made me slow down my steps . It was quite possible . Nobody liked to go to the Willard farm , which was one of the reasons why their milk business had fallen away to almost nothing . As Jim had told me , if it were n't for everybody 's feeling sorry for old Mrs. Willard and Lydia , nobody would have taken their dirty milk anyway . It was Mrs. Willard and Lydia who took the orders and delivered the milk ( in an old blue wagon ) and collected the bills . If it had n't been for Mrs. Willard , Jim said , they 'd all have starved to death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide planks , laid over a series of rotten piles , with a handrail at either side . The water under it was very shallow and littered with every kind of debris . There were innumerable tin cans , bottles , fragments of rusted iron , quantities of broken glass ? even an old muskrat trap , with a piece of rusted chain still attached , which I thought a little of salvaging . I stood there for several minutes , looking down into the water , and out of the corner of my eye glancing also at the house . There was no sign of life , not a sound . I could see the half dozen cows up on the hill  --  a spur of Hateful ? a half mile above me . All the windows were shuttered , except one on the ground floor , to the right of the door ; and this , despite the hot weather , was closed . As I walked up the brick path I saw two humming-birds dart out of the trumpet-vine and whizz round the corner ; and I caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other end . I went up the four steps to the shabby porch and knocked at the door . Standing there , I could see into the cow-yard , which was paved with cobbles . Or rather , it had been paved at one time ; now , one merely saw the cobbles here and there , amid dung and water . An old tub and pump stood at the far end , and beyond that the dilapidated shed . I waited for several minutes without hearing anything and then , somewhat timidly , knocked again . The door withdrew itself swiftly from my knock , and a white-haired woman stood before me . She was tall , and had the blackest and fiercest eyes I have ever seen . She was rubbing one red fist against her blue-checked apron . " Well ! " she said , snappishly . And then , before I could muster speech , " What is it ? " I felt guilty , and stammered something about a letter for Mr. Willard , holding it out toward her half-heartedly . At that , she merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned her back on me . As she walked away , I had a glimpse into the room . It was large , with a huge fireplace , but almost entirely hare . There were no rugs on the unpainted floor , which looked spotlessly clean , and the furniture con sisted of three or four ordinary kitchen chairs and a kitchen table . Isaac I saw at once  --  he was sitting at the table with a book open before him . If he had heard his wife , he gave no sign of it . He continued to read as if nothing whatever had occurred . And while I waited for him to move , I saw another woman  --  Lydia , I supposed  --  at the other end of the table . Her head was down on the table , her arms outstretched , herbandsclasped . Ithought I saw her shoulders moving . Then Isaac rose , put his hand flat on the page for a moment , as if for a kind of emphasis , and came towards the door . He wore red rubber boots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy . His face  --  as I saw when he stood before me , or rather above me  --  was narrow and high and flushed , with the gray suspicious eyes set very close together . His mouth , turned downwards at the corners , was curiously arched over his big teeth , and the effect was a mixture of ferocity and weakness . " Well ? " he said . " It 's a letter for you , " I said . " Why did n't Mr. Greene bring it ? " " I do n't know , sir . He asked me to bring it . " " Well , by Ephraim ! . . . " He closed up his eyes to slits and glared . " Give it here . And do n't you ever do his dirty work again . " He took hold of my shoulder so firmly with thumb and forefinger that it hurt me . " You hear ? " " Yes , sir ! " " And now , git ! " And with that he shut the door so quickly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having my feet caught against the jamb . When my aunts and Jim heard of this expedition , they were unfeignedly horrified . I was told never to do such a thing again  --  never to go to the house , nor even on the Willard land . My Aunt Julia was especially alarmed . She seemed to feel that I had done well to escape with my life ! Even Jim , I could see , was concerned ; he shook his head and solemnly advised me to give old Isaac a wide berth . " If you 'd a ' struck him on one of his bad days , " he said ruminating , " you might have got a hell of a licking , and a sermon thrown in . There was a kid in Hackley Falls got beaten black and blue once . " " Who was it ? " " Well , I do n't remember . " " What had he done ? " " Well , I do n't remember that either . But you keep away from there , Billy , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say . " All of this not unnaturally only whetted more keenly my appetite for further adventure , and it was n't long before I had discovered a new and thrilling pastime . Crossing the Mill River by the covered bridge , I would then turn westward , climb up what was called the Rock Pasture , one of those delightful New England hillsides of granite and cedar and juniper , and eventually come to the wood which covered the long spur of Hateful Mountain . This spur ran westward as fas as Hackley Falls itself , roughly paralleling the river . It had occurred to me that if I were to scout through the edge of the woods , I should eventually come out at the upper end of Isaac 's cow-pasture . And from there , taking cover behind the firs or birches or rocks , it would be easy to get a view of the Willard house , and from no very great distance . What profit I expected to get from this , heaven knows ! The first time I did it I took elaborate precautions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then , when I began to approach Willard 's farm , got down and crawled forward on my hands and knees . I crept through the fringe of white birches at the edge of the pasture and then found to my delight that I could make my way down the hill toward the house by crawling from rock to rock , at last taking up a position not more than three hundred yards from the back of the house . Here I had admirable shelter  --  a great granite bowlder , covered with silvery lichens , beside which grew a cedar tree . There was a warm hollow of grass behind it and , looking between the rock and the tree , I could see perfectly without in the least being seen . Old Isaac 's cows grazed peacefully round me , not at all disturbed ; and I could look straight down into the cow-yard to which they would eventually be driven . The house itself was shuttered , at the back , as in front . There were two doors  --  one leading down into the cow-yard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which occasionally Mrs. Willard would come out to hang her washing on the clothes-line , or she and Lydia together to work in the small vegetable garden . On such occasions they both wore old-fashioned calico bonnets . They worked grimly and in silence , hoeing and digging like men . At the end of the patch nearer to me , they were scarcely a hundred yards away , and I could hear the regular clink of their hoes on the pebbles , and once in a long while a remark  --  usually made by old Mrs. Willard and usually very brief and sharp . They never looked at each other when they spoke . When , now and then , they paused for a rest , they would stand with their hands on their hoes and gaze down toward the house . There seemed to me something ominous in the way they did this  --  they never looked anywhere else and they were always perfectly silent . It gave me the shivers . As for the old man , I wondered what he was doing . I never heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon , and very seldom saw him . Once in a long while he would come out of the house and lurch across the cow-yard to the shed  --  what he went for , I do n't know  --  perhaps cider . I made this expedition many times in my first three summers at Hackley Falls ; and by degrees , as nothing spectacular ever happened , I was beginning to think myself a fool . Still , the rumors about the Willards grew in number and intensity  --  they were becoming almost legendary figures of heroic size  --  and it was easy enough , even for a boy , to see that all three of them were half crazy : one had only to watch the way they walked . Moreover , I had got into the habit of going to the Willard pasture  --  it was something to do . And in the fall there were the chestnut trees , the best of which were directly north of the field . I used to go there and club the trees and then carry my spoils down to my Tarpeian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept an eye on the enemy . I was clubbing my favorite tree one afternoon , in the third fall , when suddenly , from behind , a cold hand closed round my neck , and I felt myself being shaken . My heart fairly fell out of me when I looked up and saw that it was old Isaac who had hold of me . But to my astonishment  --  not that it by any means mitigated my terror  --  I saw that he was smiling , smiling in a horrible way which looked as if it might be meant to be playful or affectionate . He continued to hold me by the neck and to shake me gently . " Whose tree is that ? " he said . " I do n't know , sir . " " It 's mine . So you know , now  --  do n't you ? " " Yes , sir . " " Do n't you never read the Bible ? " " Yes , sir . " " Ever learn the Ten Commandments ? " " Yes , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me round , so that I faced him directly for the first time . He had on a dirty corduroy coat with a red lining . He was still smiling , and I was more frightened than ever . It seemed to me that he was drunk . " Well , what 's the eighth ? " " I do n't remember , sir . " He shook me playfully  --  but harshly ? by the neck . " ' Thou shalt not steal . ' Say it . " " Thou shalt not steal . " " Who 's your father ? " This question was shot at me so abruptly that I was confused . Did he mean  --  since we were talking of the Commandments  --  God ? Or did he simply want to tell my father what I 'd been doing ? " Mr. Walter Crapo , sir . " " Say ! . .. I knew your mother . She was a godfearing woman . Now give me that there club . " I gave him the stick , which all this time I had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking he was going to beat me with it . To my amazement , instead , he drew away , bent over backwards till the stick was touching the ground , all the while smiling at me with half-shut eyes ( and I saw for the first time the thickness of his white eyebrows ) and then with a whip of his long arm , let the club fly upward into the very top of the tall tree , where it went crashing among the thickest cluster of nuts . The burrs pattered heavily on the grass and sweetfern about us , and then the stick followed more slowly , rocking from branch to branch and sliding over the planes of nodding leaves . Old Isaac was delighted . " That was good , " he said , breathing heavily . " And I ai n't done it for years , neither . " " Yes , sir . " " Now fill your cap , boy , and git home , and then you cut those nuts in two and butter them with cheese . That 's Adamneve on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And do n't you go coming here any more like a thief ! When you want my chestnuts , you come and ask for ' em . " Before I had time to say a word in reply , he turned and went plunging down the hillside . He had on his red rubber boots as usual , and his mane of white hair looked very bright in the sunlight . I watched him until he had entered his cow-yard , and the shed , and then , re-appearing , had stumbled into the house . Then I gathered the chestnuts and went home . But I said nothing to Aunt Julia and Aunt Jenny . It was two years before I visited " Witch Elms " again , and when I did I found that startling changes had occurred . In the first place , Jim met me at the station with a spick-and-span brand-new Ford touring car . I could hardly believe my eyes . Were my aunts being modernized ? To tell the truth , I was feeling this year rather grown up and superior and had somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And as I see it now , the Ford was a very cunning piece of foresight on the part of my Aunts Jenny and Julia . Possibly my father had conferred with them . At all events , the sight of the Ford cheered me up at once . The summer would n't he so had . And I felt still better when Jim told me that I was going to be taught to drive , after which I was to be the family chauffeur . I understood this further , when I saw that Jim himself was decidedly uncomfortable in the car . It was apparent that he missed his whip . He had also ( I nctieed with amusement ) given up the old time-honored derby hat and substituted for it a tweed cap , in which he looked extraordinarily foolish . This too , I supposed , was a concession to modernity . " Well , Jim , " I said , " what 's the news ? I suppose the aunts are fine ? " " Well , yes , they been very well , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Miss Jenny 's gout , which troubled her some . But I reckon she 'll be all right again , come hot weather . " " And Captain airmen ? " " Yep  --  same as ever . " " I suppose he still sits there with that spyglass . " " Oh , sure ! It 's as good as a movie to him . Not much the old man misses with that glass ! " Jim drove very slowly , and it was some time before we passed the footbridge which led to the Willard farm . I turned and looked at the house , which was more incredibly dilapidated than ever . The shingles were beginning to curl with rot . A great poll of trumpet-vine had collapsed from the western gables and hung raggedly toward the ground , just as the wind had left it . The front fence of the cow-yard had fallen in , too , and lay where it had fallen . Otherwise , it was just as I remembered it , with all the windows shuttered except one . But there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where are the cows ? " I said . " Did n't you hear ? " " Hear what ? " " Why , the old man , old Isaac , he had a stroke . " " A stroke ? You mean he 's dead ? " " Oh , no  --  no such luck . Just paralyzed . Paralyzed from the waist down . " " Good Lord . When did that happen ? " " Last year  --  year and a half ago . The judgment of God , too , that 's what they say . He was beating Miss Lydia when he was struck down . " " You do n't say ! " " Yep ! He laid unconscious like a log for two weeks , and they thought he was all through . But then he come to . He would ! Now he reads his Bible in a wheel-chair , and I guess , from what I bear , he gets what 's coming to him from the women folks ! " " What do you mean , Jim ? " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anyways , that 's what young Hal Greene says . He said when he went there once he heard the old man screaming bloody murder . And serves him right ! Hell will be too good for Isaac . Of all the mean sons of bees ? " I got no more out of Jim ; but a week later , when for the first time I triumphantly drove the Ford up the hill to Captain Phippen 's , I began to feel something very sinister and dangerous in the situation . Captain Phippen was surprisingly serious about it . " You know what I think , Bill ? " he said . " What ? " " I think those scarecrows 'll kill him . That 's what I think . I think they 'll kill him . " " Why ? " " They 're crazy as bedbugs . To my mind , they should all have been locked up years ago . And Good Jumping Jupiter Almighty ! look what the old devil has put them through ! You could n't blame them . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , any more than with those she-fiends either . But just the same it kind of gives you the shivers to think of him sitting there in a wheel-chair with his Bible , and those two harpies just itching to cut his throat ! . . . Does n't it ? " This was a new light on the situation . " It does , " I said . " You bet it does ! " " Could n't something be done ? " " Go and try it , my boy . Even Mr. Perkins , the minister , do n't dare go near the place . " " Well , how do they live ? " " God knows . But they live , some-how . " I returned home with a new sense of disaster impending ; but neither I , noranybody else , could possibly have foreseen what shape it was to take , or how horrible it was to be . It was difficult at " Witch Elms , " however , to be for long concerned about remote possibilities of disaster ; and as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julia and Aunt Jenny , I thought less and less about the Willards . To tell the truth , my boyish excitement about them had worn itself out . If indeed a tragedy was enacting itself in that forlorn old house , it no longer seemed to me of heroic proportions . My former terrors and wonder now seemed to me childish , and I drove past the house in the Ford twice a day with scarcely a glance at it . And , moreover , my aunts kept me busy . The car was a new toy , and they could n't have enough of it . What with that and the new telephone , and the phonograph , the tempo of life had changed at the farm ; and the days went like minutes . Hardly a day passed , in fact , that we did n't make a long expedition . My aunts had seldom been more than ten miles from Hackley Falls , and it was wildly exciting to them to be taken to Rutland , to Burlington , to Bellows Falls , or over the Mohawk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Windsor , and I shall always remember with what girlish delight and flutter Aunt Jenny and Aunt Julia came down to dinner in the great gilt dining hall of the Green Mountain House . They were as pink as debutantes , and as coquettish , and they insisted on eating every item in an enormous table-d'h  --  te dinner . I even think they would have danced with me if I had suggested it  --  though Aunt Julia 's scorn of " these modern so-called dances " was outspoken . Meanwhile , Hackley Falls was having a new excitement of its own . A revival had come to town  --  something the town had never had before . I first heard of it from Mr. Greene at the post office : he was surprised I had n't known . It had been there for three days already , and the whole countryside was wild about it . Farmers and their families were driving in from miles around . There were mourners ' benches and a sawdust trail and all the fixings , lie said . And the Reverend something-or-other Boody , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist in brimstone and hellfire . Fairly fried your liver in you , Mr. Greene said , and talked just like a nigger . .. . Mr. Perkins , the local minister ( who got a salary of a thousand dollars a year ) was furious . He had said something nasty about the Reverend Boody in his last Sunday 's sermon . . .. But the Reverend Boody continued to take in money . It was that same afternoon , when I was bringing the aunts back from a drive to Manchester , that I first saw it . It was a circular tent , of about the size used in county fairs , with a little peak at the top , and it had been pitched in a field on the Hammond farm at the western end of the town , half a mile out . At the far end of the field , which had been churned and trampled brown with feet and hoofs and wheels , was a motley assemblage of cars , wagons , and buggies , and tethered horses . I wondered what Cross-eyed Hammond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the way round , with flamboyant posters . In scarlet flaming letters we were adjured to Hit the Sawdust Trail , to Come to Jesus , Repent , Repent , Seek Salvation in the Lord , Cling to Jesus , and so on . I stopped the car and invited the aunts to go in . We could hear the somewhat dismal sound of a hymn . But they declined , and I drove on , resolving to come back myself later . The next day brought a typical northeast gale and rain . At such times the clouds seemed to come right down into the valley , like fog , and sensiblepeople stayed indoors . My aunts had no desire to use the car , so I decided I would use it myself . I went for the mail in the forenoon and then drove out to the revival and , as I might have foreseen , found that the weather had been too much for most of Mr. Boody 's audience . Only a half dozen vehicles stood in the muddy field , and from the tent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hear a sound . Hcavever , I got out and crossed the field and entered the tent through the flap-door . At first when I entered my entire attention was taken up by the tent itself , which seemed to be on the point of collapse . It rocked like a tree in a storm . I had no sooner got in and seen the sawdust trail before me than a violent gust almost lifted the whole structure . With a series of sharp reports like cannon-shots , the segments of canvas on the lee side bellied outward , and then , as the pressure relaxed , clapped inward again . The ropes creaked , a damp wind assailed me across the sawdust , and in the roof of the tent there was a continuous low whistling . And , uplifted against the elements , I could hear the shrill voice of the Reverend Boody . " Who 's a-goin ' to discountenance the Lord ? " he cried . And then after a moment he answered himself , " No one ! " And just as I sneaked into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny audience stood up and chanted , " Amen ! " I rose hastily and sat down when they did . " Who 's a-goin ' to flout the King of Justice ? " he cried  --  and I saw him now , a small , knock-kneed , plump fellow , with a frock coat and moist eyes . And again he answered himself sternly , " No one ! " And again the small audience rose and sang , " Amen , " drawling it out interminably . " Who 's a-goin ' to fool the Lord of Hosts ? . . . No one . " " A-a-a-a-a . me-n-n-n-n ! " I was just beginning to think that this business of standing up and sitting down might soon become a nuisance , when Mr. Boody launched himself into what seemed to be a kind of sermon . He walked to and fro on his little muslin-draped platform , with his pudgy hands clasped behind his back , and began shouting disjointed phrases . " Abraham ! Abraham and Isaac on the mountain ! . .. And Abraham rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went unto the place of which God had told him ! " He paused , glowering at his audience , and it was in that moment that I saw , for the first time , the Willards , Mrs. Willard and Lydia . They were at the extreme left-band end of the second row , all by themselves , so that I could see them in profile . They were both in white , with black hats , and leaning intently forward . Their noses were exactly , preposterously , alike . " And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon ' frau , his son ; and he took the fire in his hand , and a knife ! .. .9 , A series of loud reports from the flapping canvas interrupted him , and with hand uplifted he waited for quiet . In that instant Lydia Willard turned round , and , by accident , looked straight at me . She had her mother 's fierce black eyes , the same thin-lipped intensity and whiteness ; but what most struck me about her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face , or a monkey 's , small , hard , and concentrated . It seemed to me there was nothing human in it whatever . " And Abraham stretched forth his hand , and took the knife to slay his son .... My brothers and sisters in Christ " ? Mr. Boody paused again for effect , and glared from one to another of his audience ? " what does this mean for us ? What does this grand storytell us ? Two things . . . two things ! . . . The first , that we must trust in God . His will is our will . The second ? " Again he paused dramatically . And then suddenly , pointing a quivering finger directly at Mrs. Willard , who gave a start and then sat rigid , " What is the second ? That we must be prepared to offer up to God in holy sacrifice even those things that are dearest to us . What He asks , we must give . If He asks us for our children , we must give them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear to us than our children ? Is His word less than our law ? Do we understand Him ? Do we dare .. . do we dare to say that we know what His purpose is ? No ! " He was beginning to work himself up . He paced rapidly to and fro on his little wooden platform , now and then stopping for a moment to thump his fist on the deal table . But I thought / had had enough ; and a little later , seizing the opportunity afforded by another shuddering series of explosions from the tent , I sneaked out to the car and drove home . It seemed to me a pretty poor show . The wind blew all afternoon , with sudden squalls of hard rain . At one time it was so dark that we had to light the lamp in the sitting room . Looking out of the front windows , we could at such moments see hardly farther than the red-covered bridge : Hateful Mountain had been engulfed in cloud . Then would come a sudden lifting of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would show us the swollen river , brown with mud , rushing westward through the drenched valley . The dirt road was a solid sheet of water . It was a little after five when the telephone rang . I heard Captain Phippen 's voice . " That you , Bill ? " " Hello , Bill ? ... There 's some-thing queer down at the Willards ' . " His voice suddenly faded away . " What 's that ? " I said . " Can you hear me ? . .. I say , there 's something queer down at the Willard farm . Think you could come up here quick in your Ford , and fetch me ? " " Why , sure . . . . Sure , I 'll be right up ! " Aunt Jenny put down her magazine and looked at me sharply . " What 's the Captain want ? " she said . " Oh , just company , I guess . " " Well , bring him back to supper  --  he owes us a visit . And tell him there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I grabbed my hat and raincoat and ran to the barn for the car . It had almost stopped raining  --  there was a hole in the clouds overhead  --  but the northeast still looked black . What on earth was happening ? I learned soon enough . Captain Phippen was waiting for me on his porch , in his oilskins . He had his spyglass in his hand . " I did n't mean to scare you , Bill , " he said , " but just take a look . It do n't look right . " I ran up the wooden steps , took the glass from his hand , and directed it toward the Willard farm . I could see the house very clearly at that moment . A shaft of watery sunlight illuminated it brilliantly against the somber rain-colored country beyond . And it looked exactly as it always did . But when I swung the glass to the right , toward the cow-yard , what I saw amazed me . Above the fragment of board fence which still remained ( where years before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could distinctly see the heads and shoulders of the two women . There was nothing so remarkable in that . What was remarkable was the way the heads and shoulders were behaving . They glided to and fro rapidly , now to the right and now to the left  --  and now and then it seemed to me that their arms were raised  --  but they always came back to the same spot . At this spot , the heads and shoulders would sometimes disappear entirely , only , the next instant , to leap high into the air again , exactly like puppets . It looked as if the two women were doing some idiotic sort of dance . In fact , it was so absurd that I laughed . " It 's damned funny ! " I said . Captain Phippen made no answer . He took the glass from me and levelled it westward . " What do you say we go down there , Bill ? " He put the brass telescope on the porch-rail . " Sure , if you like ! " " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yeap , I do . D' you see that chair on the porch ? " " No . " " Take another look . " I did so , and sure enough , on the little side-porch , next to the cow-yard , I could make out the wheel-chair , lying on its back , with its wheels in the air . " That 's queer , " I said . " And not so funny ! . Let 's go down there . " It took us about ten minutes to get to the Willard footbridge . The flooded river was almost up to the level of the bridge ; and as we walked cautiously along the slippery planks , we could hear crazy shouts from the cow-yard . For the moment , we could see nothing , because of the low , straggling lilac-hedge which ran across the front corner of the yard . But when we had passed this barrier we stood still in sheer astonishment . The two women had gone completely mad . I 'm sure they had seen us approaching ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Round and round the cow-yard , which was half mud and half water , they were dancing in a grotesque , hobbling circle , like a pair of scarecrow bacchantes . They were so drenched with rain and mud , from head to foot , as to he hardly recognizable . Raising and flapping their arms , they shouted incessantly and incoherently something that sounded like " Bow down , Isaac ! Bow down , Isaac ! " ; and as we ran forward we could see that the huddled object in the mud , which now and then they paused in their dance to kick , was old Isaac , but scarcely distinguishable from the filth in which he lay . The red rubber boots pointed mutely toward the river . It was when he saw these , I think , that Captain Phippen shouted something harshly at the two women ; and , suddenly quieted , they drew a little way oil from us and stared at us with the dull , curious surprise of animals . Without protest or comment , almost without interest ( standing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us pick up the lifeless body and carry it , dripping , into the house . At first I thought Isaac NUS dead . It seemed incredible that such a shapeless thing covered with water and mud and blood  --  could be alive . The sight of his face  --  no longer recognizably human  --  sickened me . But Captain Phippen , hardier than I , opened the soaked waistcoat and discovered that Isaac 's heart was still beating . .. . I was only too glad to be sent for the doctor . Two days later , nevertheless , old Isaac died , a. sacrifice to the Lord . An embarrassed coroner and jury gave the cause of his death , officially , as " an apoplexy , induced by over-exertion . " During this time , and for a few days after , Mrs. Willard and Lydia , who had both become suddenly very meek , were left unmolested : the town authorities were uncertain what to do with them , Was it a murder ? Or , if not , what was it ? ... The State authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lydia and her mother had been " spirited " away , as the papers put it , to the asylum . And on the same day the Reverend Mr. Boody left town very hurriedly . Mr. Perkins had again mentioned him ( it seemed ) in the pulpit of the Congregational Church . " As a direct result of the maunderings of this primitive and predacious fanatic . . . " said Mr. Perkins , among other things . . . But was it only that ? I hold no brief for poor Mr. Boody ; but it seemed to me that the affair was n't quite so simple . Though it was true enough , apparently , that several people had seen the two women driving hack from the revivalist meeting just before the tragedy , " as if hell possessed them . " And even then ( Mr. Greene said ) " They were singing ! "
