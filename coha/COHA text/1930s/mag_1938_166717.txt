LOUISA MAY ALCOTT - Katharine Anthony-Knopf ( $3 ) . <P> When Van Wyck Brooks called the period of Hawthorne , Emerson and Bronson Alcott the flowering of New England , he did not use the phrase for its warm , poetic savor . Not only in Brooks 's book but in lesser works like Odell Shepard 's Pedlar 's Progress : The Life of Branson Alcott , readers can catch whiffs of a morning freshness in the cultural air , when poets and novelists no less than practical citizens took on themselves lifetime projects , came back to work unshaken after personal tragedy or public disgrace . <P> In some ways the buoyant , penniless , unbreakable Bronson Alcott-who bounced up and down as good-naturedly as if the path from success to failure was the most pleasant and natural one in the world-symbolized this spirit better than anyone else . <P> New England 's culture had begun to go to seed before the Civil War , but the war acted as an almost killing frost . Where Bronson Alcott 's first experiences were peaceful peddling trips to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the great world in a Civil War hospital , where , in her first hour on duty , her patient died , and where she tried to lessen a soldier 's agony by reciting Dickens to him while his arm was being amputated without an anesthetic . Bronson Alcott returned from his trips across the U. S. in times of peace , usually broke but refreshed and inspired ; his daughter came home from her glimpse of the wartime U. S. sick , neurotic , her health permanently affected . <P> A careful , sympathetic biography , Katharine Anthony 's Louisa May Alcott points the contrast between father and daughter , draws a subtle picture of the relationship within the strange Alcott family , but is principally memorable for the light it throws on U. S. culture before and after the Civil War . Viewing Louisa Alcott as a writer of great native powers , and Little Women as a work of genuine social and literary influence , Miss Anthony with gentle strokes traces Louisa Alcott 's progress from a high-spirited tomboy to a hardworking old maid . The impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of her efforts . In Louisa 's revolt against her father 's unpracticality , she set herself to make money . She got her money and her popular success but none of the intellectual following she deserved and needed . At 56 her nerves and health collapsed . Shut away in a darkened house in Roxbury , her acute illness unknown to the world , she died two days after her father , who wanted none of the things she broke her heart trying to get .
