In a resounding decision that put it in direct conflict with the Federal bench , the U. S. Labor Board last fortnight held National Electric Products Corp . in Ambridge , Pa. guilty of unfair labor practices under the Wagner Act . A Federal district court had held that a contract by which the corporation granted a closed shop to an A. F. of L. union was valid and must be obeyed . The Board flatly declared the contract was " void and of no effect " and must be ignored ( TIME , Sept. 13 ) . Last week the Board carried the controversy a step farther only to make a monkey of itself . <P> The reason which the Board had given for declaring the contract void was that its " precipitate granting " smacked of trickery since the corporation well knew that the A. F. of L. union " did not represent the free choice of a majority of its employes . " Therefore the Board ordered a plant election . Last week it was held . Result : 780-to-675 in favor of A. F. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temper of its workers more correctly than the Board , the case was not ended , for the ballots of 155 clerks and maintenance men were challenged by both A. F. of L. and C.I.O. , and the election was thrown back into the lap cf the Labor Board . The broader question of the case - whether an employer should obey the Board or the bench when their orders conflict-also remained to be settled in what may well be another Supreme Court test of the Wagner Act .
