txt Two announcements in the last .48 hours have accelerated the ascending star of the dynamic Mr. Harry L. Hopkins , federal relief administrator . The nrst was the word from Pi esident Roosevelt that Mr. Hopkins will head the new Civil Works Administration , designed to virtually wipe out relief rolls in the United States The second , from Mr. Hopkins him , self , put the Federal Government in I complete control of the relief facilities of Kentucky after the State had neglected Its unemployed . Mr. Hopkins has a saying that " you get nowhere by conforming to established custom . " He has never appeared happier since he came here last May than he did yesterday when the President made the breathtaking announcement that moie than $600,000,000 will be spent outright to give 4,000,000 men self ' sustaining work . This followed the dispatch of a telegram to Gov . Ruby Lefton of Kentucky , notifying him that because of the State 's unwillingness to care for its own destitute , Mr. Hopkins had assumed control of the administration of relief in Kentucky and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What this action may mean , as a precedent for other states which , fail in their duty toward their unemployed no one will say . Five other southern states  --  Florida , South Carolina , Louisiana , Mississippi and Arkansas  --  are 100 per cent on federal relief because local funds are exhausted , but Kentucky is the first State to be taken over because ' its local politicians refuse to tap available Sources of revenue for relief/ Another precedent-breaking function mimed by Mr Hopkins is directing the purchase and distribu- Attention ! tlon of farm surpluses to feed and clothe the needy . He has secured the aid of the private distribution agencies in getting these supplies to their destination . Indeed . even Mr Hopkins ' original job as relief administrator is unique in that he has : harge of the allocation to states of the first $500,000,000 appropriaion made for direct relief grants . Local administrators have to be on their toes under Mr. Hopkins ' iddance . Typical of the way he Yorks is a telegram sent out yesterlay to all state administrators in'orming them that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothng among families on relief and nstructing them to immediately urnish all the clothing , bedding Ind blankets needed for the winter . ( ' his fall he has authorized relief funds to be spent ' for school books , r9r transient camps , for adult edusation classes , nursery schools , for whool lunettes for the undernourished and for drought and storm relief . While not a professor , Mr. Hop-cans has much the same experimental attitude toward the present recovery program as have members tf the " Brain Trust . " He is a native of Sioux City , Iowa , the son of a harnessmaker , whose forbears migrated from Amesbury , Muss. , and of a Canadian girl who became head of the Methodist Home Mission Board in Iowa . The mother , determined that her four sons and a daughter should have a college education , moved the family to Grinnell , Iowa. , where the relief administrator was graduated , a Phi Beta Kajipa , from Grinnell College 20 years ago , While his head was set on buy-trig a country newspaper , Hopkins gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' camp in New York . From that he stepped into social service work , public and private in New York City . During the war he went to New Orleans to direct civilian relief. , Later he went back to New York and was loaned to the state relief administration when Franklin Roosevelt was Governor . When ' Congress passed the relief bill last spring , President Roosevelt took up the telephone and ordered Mr. Hopkins to Washington to take the job of administering it . This was on Saturday and though he hesitated , the President firmly told him to report for duty on Monday morning . He came , at a salary reduction of about $3000 a year . In the live months he has been here he has talked to the governor of practically every State and delegations from many cities in his bare , unpretentious office , impressing upon them the necessity of their carrying their share of the relief burden and guarding the $500,000,000 federal fund from political intrigue like a hawk . Transmitting his ' sincerity with a keen eye and straightforward manner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are almost epigrammatical . Here are some for example : " I 'm beginning my Job with ' the premise that relief is bad ; " " States and local communities have got to go to bat and do their part or we 're licked before we start . " " I do not believe any state is going to be able to raise relief funds like a magician pulling rabbits out of a hat ; " " we are going to meet this problem head-on in a way it hash't been met before ; " " The 6,000,000 children now receiving relief are hot the children of ne'er-do-wells , they are the children of the finest citizens of America , " and ( exhibiting a graph showing the mounting burden of relief ) , " You never saw a curve like that before in United States history . " The relief administrator 's chief aversions are the I a. m. calls from newspaper reporters which wake his baby daughter .                    @
