txt A world-wide expedition bent on discovering the baffling secret of the cosmic ray will be undertaken this year by Dr. Arthur H. Compton , Professor of Physics at the University of Chicago , Nobel prize winner in 1927 and distinguished for his research in this field . Lofty mountain ranges scattered around the earth will be scaled for studies by physicists in a twoyear survey directed by Dr. Compton . Professor Compton intends to find out what the cosmic rays consist of and where they come from , whether from the sun or from intergalactial space , hundreds of millions of lightyears from the earth . He will start in March on a six months ' expedition to Peru , New Zealand , Australia , Hawaii and Alaska to continue experiments already begun in the Rockies and in the Alps . Three other cooperating expeditions will be organized for a world survey , one in South America , another in South Africa and a third in the Himalayan Mountains . The work is made possible by a grant from the Carnegie Foundation . Measurements of the rays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distributed stations and at heights varying from 7,000 to 20,000 feet . North and South polar expeditions will also carry the measuring instruments . " A survey such as this , " said Professor Compton , " should give the most adequate test that has yet been devised to distinguish whether the cosmic rays are photons , as are light and X-rays , or electrons such as give rise to the earth 's aurora . " Because of the effect of the earth 's magnetic field electrons should give less intense rays near the Equator than near the Pole . Likewise if the cosmic rays have their origin In the earth 's atmosphere , there should presumably be variations with the geographic location . " The cosmic rays are a type of radiation that strikes the earth from above . They are measured by means of sensitive electrical equipment designed to measure the electrical conductivity of the air . At high altitudes the air is electrically a better conductor than at low altitudes , due to the fact that these rays are more intense at the high altitudes . It seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which makes long distance radio broadcasting possible , may be due to the ionization of the upper atmosphere produced by these rays . Rays Similar to Starlight . " If . as now seems probable , the cosmic rays enter the earth 's atmosphere almost uniformly from all directions , it would indicate that the rays originate in some part of the heavens which is the same in all directions . This would mean that they come from interstellar space . " Thus the cosmic rays are similar to starlight in that they are due to events which took place millions of years ago at remote portions of the cosmos . " The energy in the cosmic rays is found to be roughly the same as that of starlight . Though this may come to be a very small energy , when it is remembered that the mission of light is the chief business of a star , it will be seen that as cosmic events go the cosmic rays are thus of very great importance . " In experiments last year Professor Compton found that the rays are of equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very slightly more intense by day than by night . His findings agree in general with those of Professor R. A. Milliken . Dr. Milliken has advanced the theory that the cosmic rays are Indicative of the building process in the universe , picturing them as creative streams of energy offsetting the running down process involved in the destruction of atoms through radiant energy . Points to Bothe Report . This work in cosmic rays looks toward the ultimate release of atomic energy . Professor Compton points to the recent report of a German scientist , Bothe , that he had found what he believed to be the production of very high-frequency gamma rays  --  almost cosmic rays  --  through the union of atoms . He regards this as one of the most important pieces of scientific news in years . There is the quantum theory , " the unsubstantial pageant of space , time and matter crumbling into grains of COSMIC RAY STUDY action , " as an outgrowth , and now the principle of indeterminacy , or uncertainty in the atomic field , To GIRDLE EARTH **37;827;TOOLONG Heisenberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as ranking in importance with relativity . It is with this principle that Professor Compton now deals . He finds it the key to the solution of many riddles in physics and the answer to much in psychology . The statement of this theory is that a particle may have position , or it may have velocity , but it can not in any real sense have both . " A large majority of those who have studied the newer developments agree with Eddington and with me , that the uncertainty relation is a thing that represents real limitations of our physical knowledge , " said Professor Compton , Limit Set to Information . " The principle of uncertainty really says that in making measurements by physical apparatus a limit is set to the amount of information we can gee , and beyond that limit there is no method of telling what the outcome of physical events is going to be . It is not ignorance , but the fact that the physical measurements are not of the kind that makes such knowledge possible . I have a feeling that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The laws of the new physics can not predict an event ; they tell only the chance of its occurrence . " As one whose experiments are partly responsible for this dramatic reversal of the physicists ' point of view , I have been especially interested in tracing what the significance of this change may be to human life and thought . ? ? ? " The new physics does not suggest a solution of the old question of how mind acts on matter . It does definitely , however , admit the possibility of such an action , and suggests where the action may take effect . Theory of Consciousness Viewed . " It is conceivable that some such system may hold as far down as one could go . One can not draw a limit . Consciousness may be associated with inorganic matter . There is no reason to say yes or no . Physical laws must be satisfied for any system  --  atoms or people . Physical laws are not sufficient to tell us what people or atoms are going to do . We say that people determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It may be merely that we do not know the non-physical factors which largely determine the atom 's actions , as well as we do those of living organisms , "
