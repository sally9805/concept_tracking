Politics does not allow any New Dealer to love a possible Republican candidate for President . Nor does it allow WPAdministrator Harry Hopkins , still struggling to fulfill the President 's promise to end the Federal dole , * to love Governors who do not relieve him of relief . Last week a newshawk asked Mr. Hopkins how Governor Alfred Mossman Landon of Kansas was doing his part . <P> " The Governor of Kansas , " snorted Mr. Hopkins , " has never put up a thin dime for the unemployed in Kansas . The Governor has never made an effort . Of course some cities and counties in Kansas have done well but the State has not done anything . The last thing I knew about the Governor he was trying to get money out of me to keep his schools open . " " <P> But , " suggested another newshawk , " Kansas ' budget has been balanced . " <P> " They have taken it out of the hides of the people . . . . Wait till Landon runs for President . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Kansas officials promptly pointed out that in fiscal 1933-34-35 the Federal Government had paid 69% of Kansas ' relief bill although it paid more than 75% of the relief bill in 27 States , that although most of Kansas ' contributions to relief expenses had been made through counties and municipalities , the State Government had contributed $215,000 in the last six months . <P> * In connection with turning the dole back to the States , Mr. Hopkins undertook to have 3,500,000 unemployed on work relief by Nov. 1 , a date since postponed to Dec. 1 . Last week the original deadline was reached and the latest figures issued by WPA ( as of Oct. 26 ) showed that only 1,543,000 had so far been put on work relief .
