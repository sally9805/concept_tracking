Dr. Valentina Pavlovna Wasson of New York City has two adopted children . Like most foster parents , she fretted about telling her children that they were adopted . She finally solved her problem by doing a picture book for them about a Man and His Wife who were " happily married for many years . Their one trouble was that they had no babies of their own . " The care they take in selecting a baby and the care the orphanage takes in checking on the foster parents-even peeking under their beds for dust ( see cut ) - are all described so as to reassure the children that being adopted is a highly respectable thing . This week Dr. Wasson published her book , The Chosen Baby. * Its intended market : the 16,000 U. S. families who adopt children every year . <P> Today the process of adoption is no secret . In every State numerous orphan asylums , private or State agencies have adoption services . Most famed haven is The Cradle at Evanston , Ill. , which has sent children to Al Jolson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miriam Hopkins , Joe E. Brown . <P> Adoption agencies choose parents with great care , usually prefer couples around 30 years of age who are in good health , have secure incomes and sunny dispositions and homes . Although there is no rule against giving children to well-settled single persons , the demand for children far exceeds the supply and childless couples have first choice . Greatest difficulty agencies have is discouraging people over 50 , who insist on adopting infants . Average age of foster parents , however , is around 40 , since most persons wait for adoption until they are convinced that they can have no children of their own . Great- est favorites are golden-haired little girls , around two years old . Last to go are mischievous boys of eight or ten . <P> All children are given thorough physical and mental tests before they are sent to homes for trial periods before legal adoption . Few children are ever returned to agencies . Religious ties are respected , and often children of mixed blood are supplied upon request .

Through the State Charities Aid Association in Manhattan , babies have been given to laundresses , bootblacks and laborers who have steady jobs . A letter from satisfied foster parents ( humble Italians who named their boy Tony ) received by that agency : " Strong in health , lovely in heart , red in the face , quiet in the life , intelligent , beautiful , it is the boy that God give us .

A child born out of wedlock belongs to its mother , may legally bear her name and inherit her property .                  @ @ @
