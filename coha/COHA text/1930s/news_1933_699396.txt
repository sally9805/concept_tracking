txt The French Debt . To the Editor of The New York Times : The debt owed by France to the United States must be regarded from two viewpoints . There is the American view , which requires money lent to be returned , and there is the French view , which requires that the money advanced be not reimbursed entirely or at any rate not without having been previously submitted to a new adjustment . It does not behoove me to say at this moment what are the mutual concessions that both nations can or must make to one another . I know , however , that such concessions can be offered . America is a powerful nation ; her people a noble people . They have shown more than once that they can be generous , and that nothing which concerng the needs of others on this earth is unknown to them . Let not France forget it and let her not forget also that this nation has also its problems . Let her , moreover , ponder over what she would lose if some day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may America equally remember that , although powerful , she is not exempt from the strokes of destiny . Let her wonder if some day this much-slandered France may not be helpful to her . RENT-MEL . New York , ' Dec. 24 , 1932.
