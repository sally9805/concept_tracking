If you are a 22-year-old girl built like a young Percheron ( 175 lbs. ) , so strong that your father , the county jailer , calls you his " handyman " and says you can handle the women prisoners " like sacks of potatoes , " you are not likely to have many beaus . Such was the case of Lulu Belle Kimel of Lexington , N. C. Though she was bursting with health and warm-hearted to a degree , the boys did not consider her the village belle . James Godwin , 19 , a tough and knowing High Point boy whom they brought to the jail two months ago for beating up and robbing his grandfather , seemed to feel differently about Lulu Belle . <P> When she brought him his meals and mail , Jim told her she was " sweet " and " beautiful , &; had mighty nice clothes and a pretty voice ; Lulu Belle was glad . He said he guessed he 'd die in the State 's gas chamber ; Lulu Belle was heartstricken . He said if only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be a good boy , come back for her in time . Lulu Belle believed him . <P> When her father left one day to visit his tobacco farm , Lulu Belle slipped Jim the keys . He let out his pal , Bill ( " Bad Eye " ) Wilson . They grabbed Jailer Kimel 's gun from his office , commandeered a taxi , bound and gagged the driver , Wilkes Swing , and drove to Godwin 's home in High Point for clothes and another gun . <P> Then they held up Donald Moss , a young textile worker , for his car . When Moss was slow giving it up , Godwin shot him dead . Then they drove into the night , hid in a barn near Hickory . <P> When Jailer Thomas C. Kimel got home and wormed the truth out of weeping Lulu Belle , he locked her up , resigned in shame . <P> While she was being sentenced to 60 days , word came that a posse had got Jim Godwin . Hefty , heartbroken Lulu Belle wept again . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerve , sneaked away and squealed , they did get Godwin , subdued him with a load of bird shot in the face . He still swore he had planned to come back for Lulu Belle and go straight - after he had robbed enough gas stations . Lulu Belle , out on $200 bail and hiding her fat red face at home , did n't believe him this time . She had found out he had a wife &; child .
