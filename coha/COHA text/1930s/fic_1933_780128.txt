 | clothes and dirty house . She backed away at heart from Mrs. Talbot 's loathsome weeping . Who could support the cumulative effect of such unhappiness , illness , dirt , poverty ? Mrs. Talbot 's hair  --  had she ever washed it ? ? lay in a scanty offensive snarl , matted to the back of her neck ; and , looking down on it , May had to swallow twice before she could say : " You get your coat on . I 'll be right back . " She closed the door , stepped down the two wooden steps and fled , her heels catching on the foot-marked path , yesterday 's slush frozen hard as iron . She kept her mouth open , gulping in the clean air . Entering her own back door , she saw  --  it had been impossible for her to remember  --  that she had left nothing in danger on the stove . From this frigid shed of a kitchen , she passed into the warm room . " Joe , " she said , " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty near crazy ? " " Hello , May , " Harry Weems said . He was sitting on the other side of the stove and she had n't seen him at all . " What 's the trouble ? " " Mamie Talbot died . " " Say , that 's too bad ! " Harry got to his feet , agitated . Joe had gone pale , his mouth tightening in a sort of sullenness . Joe wanted his supper , not Mrs. Talbot . Joe could n't stand Mrs. Talbot anyway  --  who could ? ? and May did n't blame him . " I could n't help it , " she said . " She ca n't get herself anything to eat . Harry , " . she added in sudden appeal , " could we get a bottle of gin or something . We 've got to give her something ? " " Sure thing , " said Harry Weems . " Get you one right away . " " Wait . I 'll pay you .

" He brought five cases from New York state last night , and he says pracy all of them are spoken for . Listen , for God 's sake , s the good of bringing Mrs. Talbot here ? " oe , I tell you she 's pretty near crazy . I do n't know she 'd do . One thing : she wanted to go up and tell Banning she hoped she was satisfied , because she 's Mamie , all right .

" Go on , " he said . " Get the hell after her ! " + In that wing of Bates ' store which was rented to the United States Government , the post office window was not yet open . Behind the high screen formed by the mail boxes , Helen Upjohn and Mr. Bates ' daughter Geraldine could be glimpsed in hasty movement under the tin-shaded lights hung above them . There was a constant sound of paper striking glass softly as envelopes went into their proper boxes . Suddenly whole small oblongs would be blocked up with rolled afternoon papers from Danbury , Bridgeport , or New York . People who cared to pay for boxes from time to time stepped forward , twisted the small combination dials , drew out whatever there was and retired to lean against the varnished wainscoting , looking at it . A row of windows let those otherwise unoccupied gaze out . All along the front , ample , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this paving and the triple concrete lanes of US6W stood half a dozen motor cars , several of them with their headlights on , their front wheels against the sidewalk edge . Out of the dark , new figures kept appearing on this well-lighted little stage .  | e went to the doors of the store and came over in ; some walked past outside and came in the post office . This opened and dosed constantly , admitting people were brought to a halt by the press , distributing selves as they could along the bits of unoccupied 1 , against the board covered with notices about fourthas mail , the Postmaster General 's obsolete request to Iil Christmas packages early , and the poster , in colors , what was being shown at a Sansbury moving picture ptre .

Here , or stepped out a minute , or just coming in , were t of the men who had a stake in New Winton ; power its government , or position in the sense of running a einess or owning a farm . Since every one knew every else clothes had no symbolic value here . Their good Fits were at home . They wore old overcoats , old boots -d overshoes ; hats and caps meant only to cover the -d . Mr. Bates , moving behind the grocery counter , his read-bare jacket hanging open on a sweater of sagging y , was First Selectman . In a very old black overcoat , Matthew Herring , the Treasurer , retained by his tall thin ame and composed face a distinct air of gentility . He me , of course , of superior people , living , well enough - do , in a large house in the unfortunate taste of the  | ' 70s above Banning 's Bridge . Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he felt the need to be presentable in Hartford . He made up for bringing his new clothes home by great affability ; he and Henry Harris , on several occasions his defeated Demo , cratic opponent for his position , stood together in the friendliest possible intimacy . The clock now said ten minutes past six and Lester Dunn called loudly : " Let 's go , Helen ! Read what he wrote afterwards ! " There was a glimpse , for those against the notice board , of Helen Upjohn 's fleeting pale smile beyond the glassfronted pigeon holes ; a little laughter rewarded Lester Dunn . The door opened and George Weems came in from his adjoining garage . Several voices saluted him . Henry Harris lifted his brown , pointed face and said , " What do you know ? " " Not so much , Henry , " George Weems nodded . " Hello , Charley . " He paused a moment and added , " Harry just came by and tells me Mamie Talbot 's dead . " Silence fell instantly . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a gradual , grave lament , separate voices : " That 's too bad ? " " Why , that 's a shame ? " " Why , yes , Mr. Weems says Mamie Talbot 's dead ? " " Do n't seem right . How old 's she ? Not more than seventeen , I should say ? " " I doubt she 's more than sixteen ? " " I surely feel sorry for Mrs. Talbot . You 'd think she 'd had her share of ? " " You ca n't hardly believe it . She was just as lively and ? " Henry Harris looked around , and seeing no one except  | hew Herring who could be called really intimate the Bannings , allowed himself , for he had a long'ng political feud with Mr. Herring , to say : " I hear took sick through overwork and underfeeding.

" We know what you say never means anything ; strangers might take you seriously . " He nodded to rles Ordway and went out the door . There was a stir and snicker of applauding laughter . ' rough this relieved sound , a voice , harsh in an old tterness re-aroused , came clear , heard by every one : That you expect when you got a horse doctor treating Just give him time , I say , and old Doc Bull can kill all . " + J " That 's all right , Virginia , " Larry Ward said . " It 's my about six or a little after . I told Mrs. Banning not Fto hurry you ; you 'd be along soon enough . " In the light-flooded garage , Larry 's face had a beautiful warm bronze color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ textured . What should have been handsomeness was subtly spoiled by a too great regularity of  | feature . It gave him the blank , insensitive look of a wax model . Like a model , too , his eyes were astonishingly bright , China blue , shaded in his bronzed face by an expression of perpetual mild perplexity . Virginia Banning got out of the Ford . " You 'd better not keep Charlotte waiting , " she said sharply . " We 're going to the dance at the Odd Fellows Hall in Sansbury , " Larry said . " I guess she 'll wait , all right . " Showing at once his idea of the splendor of the proposed entertainment , and his pleasure in Charlotte Slade 's probable docility , he came innocently close to smirking . " Well , you need n't be so damned conceited , " Virginia told him . " If I were Charlotte , I 'd drop you cold ! j " Larry looked at her , stunned to the customary confusion which afflicted him in matters not connected with farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , straightened the bright orange necktie which he had knotted into a starched linen collar , and got into the Ford . The engine was still running , so he backed out promptly , halted . " Go on , " Virginia said . " I 'll shut the doors . " " Thanks ! " he shouted , waving his hand , backed about and started down the drive . Virginia made a slight , contemptuous sound between her teeth . She pushed her gloved hands into the pockets of her leather jacket , moving speculatively to look at Guy 's car . Standing on the clean cement of the garage floor next to her father 's dark , sedately shaped , carefully kept , sedan , this car of Guy 's had a wonderfully violent air . Guy got something when he got that . She hoped , each time she saw it , that it would please her less , look more ordinary and  | desirable ; but it did n't . Its great power and trendous potential speed could not have been more quietly , trancingly evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turned out thousand after cheap thousand . to gray , its not too new enamel was flat and dull under hardened film of dust and oil ; its metal , of a luxurious ugh thickness , showed the same lusterless practicality . lean , three-pointed star was hung in a metal ring poised the radiator cap ; simple and severe badge of makers ho did n't make cars for everybody , not a tricky little tue or ornament . Virginia 's gloved hand caressed one of the great headhts couched inside the long strong swoop of mudguards ghtly dented here and there on the edges . Out the sides the formidable hood came fat tubes , like ribbed worms soiled metal . They passed diagonally astern , ducked out sight again . Virginia was not sure what they did , but seemed to imply a power too titanic for any ordinary to cover and hold . She moved along the side , glanced the open driving compartment . The keys were there . efully , unhurried and absorbed still , she passed on , fined the tires , glanced at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning , she opened the r , slid across the much-used leather of the open seat . ere she sat a moment , buttoning her jacket , pushing the collar close under her chin , tucking her skirt tight der her narrow thighs . She laid a hand on the wheel , ched and turned on the ignition . The headlights snapped up to a mighty glare on the radiators affixed along the back wall . The motor turned over vainly a moment . It caught then with a shocking thunder and she throttled it down , winc-  | ing ; opened it up again , jerking the choke . With a wheelspoke in one hand , the choke held out against possible stalling , she let the clutch engage gingerly , gazed over her shoulder , watching the long stern push out onto the drive . It bent majestically to the right until , looking front , she was pointed for the gate . Letting go the choke , she stamped on the clutch , snapped over the gear lever . Gathering momentum with a great roar , she swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slammed open , and though she did not bother to look , she heard the sound of Guy 's outraged shouts . Glancing hastily right and left , she slid through the gate , turned south in a pool of radiance from a street light at the corner . Down the ghostly sweep of US6W her long-shafted lights poured ahead . She saw a movement among the cars before the post office and jabbed her thumb on the button , sending the shattering blare of her horn down to them . The red taillights of one or two , starting to back , stopped , frightened ; a single dark figure scurried across the down-flung brilliance . She was into high ; and , given the accelerator , the motor picked up marvelously . She was doing forty-five when she roared , horn rasping out , past the hesitant parked cars ; the lighted windows of the store ; the glowing glass globes on Weems ' gasoline pumps . It was fifty-five when the half shadowed , half arc-lit shape of St. Matthias 's Church at the corner hid the bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a chance . She was past it then ; the star scattered sky opened like an immense southern dome as she dipped down beneath the last street light and off on the fine straightaway to the river bend . Lighted like the other dashboard dials from some secret  | er source , the shaking band of the speedometer showed w , now hid , the numeral 6 of 65 ; and that was certainly t enough . The air lashed stinging around the low windield , so fiercely cold it scalded like fire blown along her e . She couuld scarcely breathe ; the blast of it drove , ill , right through the leather of the buttoned jacket . Seeing that sixty-five was fast enough ; already a little raid with only this unfamiliar wheel to direct the great achine moving her , Virginia found that she was going ter . A perverse desire , born half of the awful beauty f speed , half of her fear 's delectable pain , tried its edge her shaky stomach . Not really wishing to , not able not she saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; then , e companion 5 . To her right , the gigantic frail gray ape of a tower in the new transmission line went up ' nst snow , dark hill , and at the top , stars . It was gone , d she saw , instead , the long low mound of a tobacco n . It appeared , telescoped magically , disappeared . Two elms were levered past the side of her eye . ' , Now she saw the starlight distantly on the flat snow cov'ng the river bend . With a pain of fear , an anguished ' ntness , fleetingly on the speedometer she beheld an 8 ming up . At once , its zero joined it . Her far-flung headghts had found the precise low line of the white fence , ing at the bend with the great arc of the curving road . he started to say : " Oh , Jesus . . . " but the solid wind crammed in her parting lips , choked her . With an insane and paralyzing fatality she knew that she was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at such a speed . She would have to drive through the fence , over the bank , break out a great hole in the snow-covered ice ; and every-  | thing would be quiet , freezing , star-lit on the empty road with no one stirring . A fear so great as to be more an agony of rage at the folly of killing herself when she did not want to die , for no reason at all , convulsed her . She locked her left hand on a spoke of the wheel , put her right hand on that , ready to bear down . The foot , so senselessly on the accelerator , recoiled ; she cried out in surprised minor anguish as the sharp heel of that shoe dug the instep of her other foot , bracing , both of them , on the foot brake . She did n't even think of the emergency brake ; she closed her eyes , her lungs bloated in despair ; her belly caved in . Instantly a horrid jolt took out her breath ; she drew on the wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saw the white fence leaping toward the headlights . There was a rasp and slurring screech . Pain sank in her armpits as the steering gear attempted to escape her . The car wobbled right , then left ; it hovered in a delicate indecision , poised to overturn . Two wheels fell jouncing back on the concrete ; the engine stalled . Her headlights brought up across snow covered field and bowlders and small , rotting apple trees . She was three-quarters of the way around the bend , pointed diagonally across the road . Virginia lay back in the seat , her hands limp in her lap . The bright stars seemed to quake toward the blackness of the sky as though they were going out . A taste like blood was in her mouth ; the wind , gentle , overlaid her face with a killing pain of ice . Brushing her glove distracted against her cheek , the leather came down to the dashboard radiance stained dark with sweat . She had one thigh locked over the other , the toe twisted tight around her ankle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgust that  | she had wet her drawers a little ; and at once she began to cry , for , safe and alive or not , that was really too sickening to bear . + Mrs. Cole , boarding the train at Sansbury , had inadvertently picked the steps of the smoking car ; but she was out of breath and sat down there anyway . " You be more comfortable in another car , Mrs. Cole ? " the conductor asked . " Oh , no , " she said . " I do n't object to smoking . My boy Kenneth smokes the whole time . Tell them not to stop on my account . " He went away then and she was able to settle herself and get her copy of that morning 's New York Mirror open to the daily true story . She was wearing her old bifocals instead of her new reading glasses , so the small print occupied her for most of the twenty-five minutes taken by the train to get up to New Winton . Finished , she turned to the serial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ synopsis of preceding installments : Coral Wright , beautiful and seventeen , is left alone in a little seaside hamlet upon the death of her mother . Hobart Nixon , an unscrupulous and distant relative , has long annoyed her . Roger Clark , young mining engineer and beau of Coral in her school days , is back to sell some property before going West again . He falls in love with Coral and says that someday , when he makes good , he will come back and marry her . Coral thinks it 's just a line with him . Maurice Maxwell , millionaire playboy , has built a great  | summer estate in the village . He has met Coral and asked her to his opening house party and she has half promised to come . Nixon , whose wife is deaf , sneaks into Coral 's room that night and begins to overpower her . Now Con-tinueAt this point the conductor opened the door and came down the aisle . Ahead , the locomotive broke into a doleful wail for the crossing on the Cobble road just south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next seat and said : " This is your station , Mrs. Cole . " Mrs. Cole objected : " I gave you my ticket , young man . " " Yes , I got it . This is New Winton . This is where you want to get off . " " Is this Bridgeport ? " " No , ma 'm . This is ? " " Well , I 'm going to Bridgeport . Will you tell me when we 're getting in ? " " This train do n't go to Bridgeport , Mrs. Cole . " " Why did n't you say so when you took my ticket ? Land sakes , where does it go to ? " " You do n't live in Bridgeport any more , Mrs. Cole . This is New Winton . " " Well , have the train stop , please . That 's where I want to get off . " She arose , flurried , and the conductor bent down , recovering her packages . " Those are some little things I bought at the five and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much . " She hooked her umbrella over her arm , clasped her handbag tight and poked the newspaper under one elbow . Three or four amazed faces watched her leave the smoking car . " Will you be kind enough to assist me , young man ? " she said to the conductor . " I have all these things . "  | " Do n't you worry , Mrs. Cole . We 'll get you off . " He opened the door of the other car and shouted perfunctorily , " New Winton , New Winton . . . . " When the train had moved on , and most of the cars and light trucks waiting for it had either got into motion or shown no immediate sign of doing so , Mrs. Cole judged it safe to cross from the gravel platform of the station to Fell 's Meat Market . She looked sharply at the wide dosed doors of the Station garage to be sure that no motor was going to sally out on her . Continuing she went briskly by Fell 's lighted windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the green , between Upjohn Brothers ' store and the bulky building known as Upjohn 's Hall across the way . At this point she stopped , made a slight clicking sound with her tongue , turned about and went back to Fell 's . Warner Fell himself , in a dirty apron , was behind the hacked cutting block . " Good evening , Mrs. Cole , " he said . Mrs. Cole sniffed . " Something do n't smell very fresh here , " she remarked , generally . " Why , Mrs. Cole , I 'm sure everything ? " " Well , something is n't . How are your lamb chops ? " Warner Fell pushed up the latch of the big refrigerator doors , produced , dropping on the block , a chunk of bonebacked meat . Mrs. Cole bent down and sniffed it , looked a moment at the faint round government inspection stampings in purple ink . " Hm , " she said , " it 's a poor cut . Well , I 'll take a dozen . Cut them thick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bone , chopped through with a cleaver . When he had done this four times , he said appraisingly , " Do n't you guess four would be enough , Mrs. Cole ? These are good thick ones . "  | " Yes . Four 's right . That 's two for the Doctor , and one for me , and one for Susie . " She added this to her other packages , went out and walked up to the green . Crossing the road , she passed the lighted windows of the library , looked carefully to be certain that the fire truck was n't on the point of coming out the adjoining driveway . In front of Weems ' house at the corner , she paused , glancing up and down the deserted road . Then she crossed over and passed along the upper end of the green . When she got beyond the Ordways ' house she saw that there was no light at home ; the Doctor could n't have got in yet , and she remembered that she had let Susie go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do for Susie tomorrow . Passing through the gap in the lilac hedge , she reached the door . Here on the steps , she had to set down most of her packages in order to find her key and use it . Once inside , she got a light on , went directly to the kitchen where she deposited all her things on the table . This was hardly done when the telephone rang , for , up at the other end of the green , Helen Webster saw the light . Mrs. Cole came pattering back again and took off the receiver . " No , " she said , " I do n't know where he is . I just this minute got in . Oh ! You say she died ? Oh ! Now , that 's too bad . Please wait a minute until I get something to write with . I 'll make a note for him ? " She laid the receiver down and went back to the kitchen , turning over her things on the table in search of a pad and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perplexed . Out of a page of photographs which her paper , thrown down , had exposed , the nostalgic word Bridgeport  | arrested her . It went on  --  Beauty Victim of Maniac 's Retribution ? The photograph of a dark , thick-featured girl regarded her . Revenge hinted in murderous attack on pretty Nita Popolato . Story p. 2 . Mrs. Cole made a clicking sound with her tongue and turned to page two . February 19th , Bridgeport , Conn . Near death in St. Vincent 's Hospital , Nita Popolato , dark-eyed Bridgeport beauty of seventeen , gasped out a tale of primitive vengeance and passion which set police scouring the city for After a while Helen Webster shrugged . Having no facilities for a howler circuit , the most she could do was keep ringing the line . This effected a small , discontented clucking noise , audible a few yards around the unhooked receiver in the hall . Mrs. Cole , who had found her reading glasses and pulled a chair up to the light in the kitchen , was not disturbed by it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Guy ! " She heard the violent opening of his door and his quick step in the upper hall . " Oh , never mind , dear , " she said . " I just thought I heard your car . It was probably one on the road . " " You did hear it , " said Guy . His voice was constricted with fury , and Mrs. Banning turned from her dressing  | table . " Come in , dear , " she said . " Why , what is the trouble ? " Guy pushed the door open . A pattern of half-dry lather , left from his interrupted shaving , decorated his face . He knotted the cord of his dressing gown hard about him . " Why , Guy , " repeated Mrs. Banning , " what on earth has happened ? " " What you heard , " Guy said , " was Ginny taking my car out . And I wo n't have it . I 've told her twenty times that it is n't safe for her to drive it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to let her smash it up just for fun  --  the crazy little fool ! " " Oh , " faltered Mrs. Banning , " how did she get it ? Why , how dreadful ! She could n't hurt herself , could she ? " " I do n't care what she does to herself ; it 's the car I 'm worried about . She got it because I was fool enough to leave the keys in it . How did I know she was going to sneak around and take it when I was n't looking ? If you and Father ca n't make her stop , I can . I 'll spank the pants off her ? " " Now , Guy ! " interrupted Mrs. Banning . " That 's enough ! I want you to control your temper . I quite understand that you 're upset ; and there 's no excuse for Virginia . Your father will deal with it ? " " He wo n't do anything to her ; he never does ? " " Now , darling , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia is younger than you are . She does n't always understand ? " " Understand ? " he groaned . " What does n't she understand ? The English language ? And , my God , she 's practically seventeen . You talk as if she were about ten . That 's  | the whole trouble , really . Everybody treats her like a baby . She ought to be at school . Except , I suppose , no decent school would take her , after she 's been fired from everywhere on the map . " Mrs. Banning arose . " We wo n't talk about it when you 're so excited , dear . You go and finish dressing . I 'm not excusing Virginia ; it was very wrong of her to take your car without your permission , and I know she wo n't do it again . And , Guy , try to be a little patient with her , wo n't you ? She 's not very strong , and she 's not very happy . She really has n't a friend her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " all right ! I suppose you would make her behave if you could ; and if you do n't , you just ca n't . " He turned and went out . His mother , following him , went to the stairs . The slight weight of her small , but carefully recorded and clearly seen concerns made her frown a little . She could , almost simultaneously , be anxious about Virgina ; regret Guy 's violence when annoyed ; remember to speak to Mary about the mint sauce . From the afternoon 's meeting of the School Committee , she kept her resolve to do something ? perhaps appeal to Hartford  --  about Doctor Bull 's utter neglect of his duties in regard to the compulsory vaccination of the school children at Cold Hill . Plainly the county authorities were n't going to do anything about it . Her own personal distaste for Doctor Bull , his boorishness , his coarse , roaring manner , his callous , undoubtedly ignorant neglect of his work and his patients , she tried to keep out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family like the Bulls could have produced such a person ! From her encounter with Doctor Wyck , the Rector , she  | had the matters of seeing that flowers for the altar , in the proper , seasonally difficult red of an Apostle and Martyr , were on hand Tuesday . When Doctor Wyck spoke of Tuesday , she had , with the greatest presence of mind , been able to remember that it was St. Matthias 's Day , and say so , before he made his own reference to the Feast of Our Patron . She was , after all , one of the few that Doctor Wyck relied on for a decorous High Church attitude , and she would have been much chagrined if she had let him down . Then there was poor Mamie Talbot . She must really go over tomorrow and see for herself if anything could be done to make the child more comfortable . Mamie 's illness brought back the never welcome thought of Doctor Bull ; and she wondered if Doctor Verney could n't be persuaded  --  Doctor Bull 's gross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty  --  to come up and In the hall and along the stairs , the walls were papered in the modern copy of an old pattern . Vertically , horizontally , and obliquely , in exact alignment , three sagegreen designs repeated themselves on the white ground . One was a stiff , heraldic eagle , his claws full of furled American flags ; one was a laurel-wreathed bouquet of cannon , swords , muskets , and infantry drums . The third showed the gaunt face of President Jackson . Below his bust , the cleft streamer read : Our Federal Union it must be preserved . Mrs. Banning halted and studied it , startled , for she thought that she had seen a stain near the top at the end . Her mind jumped instantly to the chance of a tub overflowing in the bath between Guy 's room and Vir-  | ginia 's . Relieved , she realized then that it was only a shadow , and went on . Turning back through the hall , the half open door gave her a glimpse of the warm dusk in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shone up the paneled , urn-topped doors of a secretary desk from her greatgrandfather 's New Haven house . Her husband sat before it , the pen in his hand moving steadily . Beyond his small neat shoulders and upright head , she could see the books climbing the wall in unbroken rows through the aureate twilight , gilt titles catching the glow . From this glimpse , as from the tranquil hall , and from the dining room ( now that she went through it ) with the fine sideboard , the laid oval table with candles unlighted , the four good Chippendale chairs  --  she wished that she had four more , instead of three more ; but seven , when they were such exceptionally good and authentic ones , was a respectable number  --  Mrs. Banning could take the quiet , never-ending , often not even conscious , pleasure of a house by years of patient effort made exactly the way she wanted it , and functioning serenely under her attentive eye . The pantry and kitchen were glowing , full of a savory warmth of good cooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enamel , the glass and noncorrosive metals of modern equipment . Mary , seated by the prim burnt orange curtains , was reading the morning paper . Ethel was calmly busy over pots steaming on the long stove . Mary put down the paper and stood up . Ethel said : " Good evening , m'am . " " Oh , Ethel , that smells very nice , " Mrs. Banning said , contented . " Mary , will you remember to use the little silver boat for the mint sauce , please ? And will you bring  | some ice and a shaker into the library in about five minutes ? I think Mr. Banning and Guy would like a cocktail . " Laying down the tapering black shadows of screening cedars , gilding the enclosing fence of woven chestnut paling , Virginia watched her headlights sweep the garage and stable . Immediately mounted up the boom of deep throated barking . Virginia could see , now that she was past the fence , the twin dog houses near the door of Larry 's living quarters . Out them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bristling , belligerent , of the Great Danes . Observing that this car was going right into the garage , first Delilah , then , eagerly , Samson , planted massive thick-toed forepaws on the trampled snow . Their splotch-marked bodies emerged . First one , then the other , barked ; monitory rather than excited . With diligent haste , majestic in their mere stature , they bounded together to investigate . Virginia brought Guy 's car to a halt beside her father 's ; switched off the ignition and then the lights . She could hear the pad of heavy feet on the cement . Samson 's sharp ears and bold , big muzzle appeared , face to face with her , his paws supported on the doortop at her side . He made at once a gratified whining sound . Jostling him , up came Delilah , pawing Virginia 's leather covered shoulder with her blunt claws . Virginia sat still a moment and Samson 's wide wet tongue slapped vigorously down her cheek . Recoiling , she pushed his head away , opened the door , forcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a half wheel , collapsed , displaying her long nipple marked breast and belly to be scratched . Virginia started to put out a foot , but her knees , she found , were not yet steady . Samson pushed his heavy head confidingly against her hip , crowding closer . The kindness of this reception seemed enough to kill her . Virginia could feel a violent tingling in the bridge of her nose ; tears swam warm into her eyes ; a trembling came over her and her chest swelled to suffocation . She sniffed a little , and Delilah rolled back ; disappointed , arose to her feet . Both of them tilted their heads up to regard her face , tongues hanging in mild wonder . She managed to say , " Leave me alone , you damn fools ! " for she knew that they were going to do that in a moment . Their instinctive , reasonless jubilation at sight of her would be innocently exhausted . The dog houses , slightly warmed by their big bodies , were where they wanted to be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack . They would withdraw , her two last senseless friends , bored with her . " Get away ! " she choked . She went and snapped out the garage lights . In the darkness she could see the dogs ' big shadowy shapes slip around the jamb , out against the starlit snow . When she had come out and pulled down the overhead doors , she saw that they were already back , snug in their kennels . At the top , across the back of the last check , Mr. Banning wrote Herbert Tracy Banning for deposit only . He  | blotted it , laid it with the others . Turning the little pile over , he took the deposit slip and compared the list . Since it was correct , he put checks and slip together in a long envelope and addressed it to his New York bank . Laying the pen on the rack of an old Sheffield tray , he sat back in his chair , thoughtful . A pad covered with columns of his neat figures informed him that he was slightly better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be much margin this year ; but really it was remarkable that there was any margin at all . Part of the difference , he supposed , was not having Virginia 's school bills through the winter . Getting herself expelled from Miss Keble 's , however regrettable , would seem to have been a very comfortable financial lift . A solid contribution , in fact ; both to him , and , little as Guy might suspect it , to Guy . It would not be necessary to bring up the matter of Guy 's expenses . This was Guy 's third year at Yale , and he had managed to spend progressively more money . Naturally , he did it without making a splurge . Being ostentatiously rich was something he and his friends regarded with contemptuous distaste ; the only possible worse form was being obviously poor . From what Mr. Banning had seen of these young men on rare occasions in New Haven , or when one or two of them came up to visit Guy , he concluded that they were perfectly satisfied if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything in merely practical quantities . This seemed to Mr. Banning reasonable . Philosophy had nothing to do with youth . If you were not a great athlete , or what seemed to be called a Big Man , and so beyond criticism , what buttressed your pride  --  not less  | excruciatingly sensitive for . being callow  --  except the perfection of your clothes and possessions ? It would be time enough to laugh at this puerile obsession with material things later , when the ego had found a new mainstay in some form of personal accomplishment and might even enjoy not looking like the great man every one could easily learn that you were . Having by now a fair idea of what it cost Guy to be impeccable in Yale 's eyes , Mr. Banning was prepared to add it to the already remarkably large total of Guy 's expenses through school and college . Guy 's education would probably prove a good investment . Guy would not , naturally , know anything in the scholastic , or even cultural sense ; but he would be admirably fitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enrich himself . There was no reason to doubt that he would be happy doing it . Since Mr. Banning had never in his own life done anything but reflect , and read in his library , and work in his garden , he was not sure that he was qualified to have an opinion on the virtue or value of Guy 's prospects . Indeed , he doubted if he knew enough about Guy to see clearly where good lay for him in life . He could not possibly guess what it was like to be Guy ; or what Guy , in command of his own affairs and able to behave as best pleased him ( rather than as his family with its crushing full knowledge of his past expected him to behave ) , was like . At home you could n't tell ; he deferred to his father partly through habit , partly perhaps because he did not and never had understood the defensive nature of his father 's dry , often indulgently ironic speech . The day had n't yet come when Guy would realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two ; that irony was really a  | form of embarrassment ; and that what his fther needed was a little firm handling . Probably , Mr. Banning reflected , he would live to find Guy competently making up his mind for him , patiently seeing that his vagaries did n't do him any real harm . Guy already had the voice and expression ; he merely lacked the sharpened eye to see that his father was an aimless old putterer . The patronage of today would be reversed as Guy , turning from his large and successful affairs , found a moment to say : " Father , you know you do n't want anything of the sort . It 's absurd . I 'll arrange to ? " The prospect amused him , and it was only right ; for Guy had none of his own disabilities . Without spoiling the effect by trying , Guy could already please people worth pleasing ; probably he was learning to command people not worth pleasing . Instead of walling himself up with austere and formal communications , Guy spoke out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the open and he occupied it , tough spirited , ready to take his chances . Of greater importance than not fearing or envying people more fortunate than himself , Guy would never feel embarrassed and apologetic to people less fortunate or weaker . Never apologetic , Guy could not be imposed on . Mr. Banning was accustomed to being imposed on , and knew that he was . His heart was half on the side of any knave who , having none himself , by begging or fraud tried to get what he could of Mr. Banning 's money . In his frequent moments of insight , Mr. Banning could see his life as really one long , half-expressed apology for being born superior , for being kept there by money not earned , for eating when other men went hungry , riding when other men walked , living at idle ease when other men struggled  | death . He did not like it much ; but any more compet or arrogant attitude he would like less . Seeing his future master coming into the library now , shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table and , fling a cigarette from it , offered Guy one . " Would you c for a cocktail ? " he asked . " Virginia ! " She was halfway upstairs , and though she heard her mother step out of the library , she went on while she said , " What ? " " C'ome down , Virginia . I want to talk to you . " " it 's almost dinner time . I have to change . " " Virginia ? " " Ca n't you ever let me alone ? " Guy had come out , too , now . " Listen , Ginny , the next time you ? " " Oh , shut up , Guy ! " " Virginia ! " The sound of her light footfalls passed along the hall above . Resounding , the door of her room went shut , slammed with all her might . " For Heaven 's sake , Mother , why do you let her get away with it ? "  | Mr. Banning , standing with his back to the fire ' shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asked . " You would n't suggest beating her , would you ? " He looked at his son with frank interest . " Well , " Guy said , " you might take her allowance away . " " That is n't very effective up here . She ca n't get anything she really wants with money . " " You might promise her something she really wants , if she 'd behave herself for a month . Or maybe twenty minutes would be enough . " Mr. Banning smiled . " It seems to me that the last thing she wanted  --  unless it was your car , which , you notice , she took  --  was to go to a notorious roadhouse over by Torrington . It seems to be not only a speak-easy but a house of assignation . We thought that it was n't suitable . " " She must be crazy ! " " No , I do n't think it 's as simple as that . We 're taught that there 's no disputing tastes . Only , it happens that almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We ca n't get results by saying , Virginia , if you do n't obey , you wo n't be allowed to go to the Congregational Church Supper . ' " Guy was slightly amused . " You might try saying that if she did n't obey , she 'd have to go . " " We might , " admitted Mr. Banning , " but I think we wo n't . I do n't know whether you 've seen Mr. Kean , the new minister there . He appears to be a polite and agreeable young man . I do n't think it would be fair to him to send Virginia in a resentful mood . She 's no great respecter of places and persons . " " The whole trouble , " Guy said , " is that you simply spoil her . She knows by this time that nothing ever happens to  | r , no matter what she does . That 's why she always gets to trouble at school . She 's never had to learn to do what cis told and keep still . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Now , it seems to me that you 're wrong there , " Mr. Banning objected . " In point of fact , the most terrible things happen to her all the time . " " I lerbert , what on earth do you mean ? " " My dear , I mean that every time she thinks of something she would like to do , her elders prevent her from doing it . What could be worse ? " " Well , she should n't want to do such asinine things ! " " I Ierbert , I do n't think that 's true at all . It seems to me that she has a remarkable amount of freedom . " ( ; uy , gazing at him , said : " You 're always on her side , Fat her . You 'd let her get away with murder if ? " " Dinner is served , ma'am . " " Oh , Mary , Virginia is n't down yet . Could we have five minutes ? " " I 'm coming , " she shouted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubber cap and slung it into the tub . Snatching a towel , she dried herself ferociously , writhed into step-ins . Coming into her room , she pulled out a drawer and found stockings , flung open the closet and threw on the bed first her blue frock , then slippers. 1 icr stockings on , her frock over her head , she dropped before the dressing table , pulled a comb through her fluffy brownish hair , drove a hairpin in by her left ear  | to hold it . Working her feet into the slippers , she unstopped a lipstick , smeared her upper lip , passed her lower lip over it . Leaving everything in great confusion , she went out and downstairs , hungry and very pale . It had taken her about four minutes . In the candle-lighted dining room , her father drew out her chair . " I hear you went for a drive , " he said , seating her . " How does Guy 's car behave ? " " It 's all right . " " Comfortable ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you thought of it . " A slight , stain-like flush began to appear on Virginia 's cheekbones . She lifted her eyes and looked across the table at Guy . " I 'm sorry I took your damn car , " she said . " I wo n't do it again . " " Well , all right , " said Guy . " It does n't matter . " Mrs. Banning , starting belatedly at the word " damn , " let her lips part to protest , but Mr. Banning said : " Very handsome , Guy . I think we can call the matter closed . What happened at the School Board meeting , Lucile ? " " I want to talk to you about it some time , " she said promptly . Where Guy got his reasonable decisiveness was easy to see ; but the truth was , Mr. Banning found it pleasanter in Lucile . That was ; there were known limits to it . If she would consider it weak to be indecisive , she would consider it ill-bred to be assertive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that consideration had once more stopped her short of accomplishment . " As bad as that ? " he said , smiling .  | " No . I simply want to find out what we can do about a Qew Medical Examiner . It 's really getting out of hand . " " Old Doc Bull cutting up ? " asked Guy . " How 's his Inamorata , by the way ? " " c ; ny1 " " Oh , heavens , Mother , " observed Virginia , her voice reviving , " do n't you think I know he sleeps with Miss Cardmaker ? " " I lerbert , I really ? " " My dear , Virginia knew all about it , it seems . What is the present difficulty ? " " I le simply will not do the work . I think Doctor Verney could find somebody in Sansbury who would come up . The difficulty is what it always is . Mr. Harris and Mr. Line . Of course , I can not get on with Mr. Harris . I 've always been as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know he dislikes me and I know he dislikes Mr. Getchell . I 've been noticing recently , and I 've never known him to agree to anything that Mr. Getchell and I favored . It seems to me real malevolence in a case like this . I mean , for him to insist on keeping an ignorant , careless , indifferent doctor in charge of the school children 's health just to be contrary ? " " What happened about your note to the County Health Officer ? " " I had an answer . He said he would bring the complaint to Doctor Bull 's attention . Of course that does n't do any good . Doctor Bull has no interest in public health . IIc ? " " Or else , too much , " Mr. Banning said . " You surely have n't forgotten that his zeal in the performance of his duty cost me fifty dollars last week ? Larry , by the way ,  | is something only very rich people can afford ; it gets clearer and clearer to me . " " Herbert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my writing to Litchfield . He knew I 'd been trying to have something done about the vaccinations at Cold Hill since last September . " " But without success ? " " No . I mean , yes . How could I ? I want to take the matter up with Hartford . " " Well , I 'll bet he did them today , " said Virginia , interested . " I met him coming from around the Cobble this afternoon , when I was going out to Val 's . I guess he would n't have been at Joel Parry 's ; I know he was n't at the Hoyts ' ; and that awful Mr. Lincoln is away . So he must have been up Cold Hill . " " That does n't change the fact that he should have done them months ago . " " I 'm afraid you 'll find it does , though , " Mr. Banning said . " As long as his duty was n't done , you had a slight chance , if you could reach the right people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking him please to do it at his earliest convenience . I 'm afraid not much attention will be paid , once it 's learned that what you complain about has already been taken care of . " " Herbert , it 's hard for me to believe that in this day and age we have to be saddled with that depraved old monster . To leave the health of the whole town officially in his care ? " " My dear , if the town is satisfied with it , what can you do ? He is n't our physician . It would be hard to show how his failings could possibly effect us . Consequently I  | do n't know that we have much right to interfere on behalf of people who do n't see the need for interference . " " Well , I can assure you that plenty of people do see the need . I think that it would be a very poor attitude for me to take , that because he does n't effect us , or ca n't , it 's not my concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what can be done with the State Health Department . " " The State Health Department acts in an advisory capacity , Lucile . Strictly advisory . We 're very jealous of our small independences in Connecticut . Personally I 'm all in favor of as little interference from Hartford as possible ; but of course , one drawback to being free is that you have to take care of yourself . " " Well , I wish you 'd show me exactly what the law is on the subject . Do you know ? " " Only vaguely , my dear . As a Justice of Peace , I try to keep some track of the Connecticut Code , but there is n't much practical incentive . We so seldom have any cases . 1 iowever , we can look it up . I 'm not sure that I would advise you to press the matter against a general indifference . It 's easily misinterpreted as officiousness  --  the train of pride , the impudence of wealth . If wealth it can be called . " " Are you through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have coffee . " The pantry door swung ajar and Mary said , " Might I speak to you a moment , ma'am ? " " Why , yes , Mary . " Mrs. Banning turned and went into the pantry . In the library , Mr. Banning said , " Cigar , son ? " " I guess not , thanks , sir . " Guy snapped open a cigarette case . He took a cigarette and Virginia took another .  | " I 'm afraid not , " said Mr. Banning . " I do n't want to seem tyrannical , but I 've explained to you before that any smoking you do until after your seventeenth birthday will have to be surreptitious . That 's not such a great inconvenience for you , is it ? " Virginia threw the cigarette into the fire . " Daddy , " she said , " I want to go to Paris . I can , ca n't I ? Val 's going . We 're going to stay with a French family . Mr. Hoyt stayed with them when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right ; and it would hardly cost anything . " " Hardly anything is rather an elastic term . " " I mean , maybe a thousand dollars , for a whole year . Daddy , say I can ! " " Do n't be crazy ! " said Guy . " What on earth would you do in Paris ? " " I 'd learn French , and we could study , and- " " Good so far , " admitted Mr. Banning . " But is it far enough ? Perhaps we 'd better postpone the hearing to give you time to prepare your case . I do n't think your mother would be enough impressed ? " " But you think I should go ? You think it 's all right ? Please , Daddy . " " Now , now , now . I have to see which way the wind is blowing . You ca n't expect me to go in on the losing side , can you ? " " Daddy , do n't joke ! Wo n't you please say yes ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear me say yes , when your mother is so likely to say no ? " " Daddy , I 've got to go . I just ca n't stand it here ! " " When is Val going ? " " In April , unless her father has to go to New Mexico . But he wo n't have to . She wrote for our reservations . "  | " My dear , I 'm sorry to say it , but there is not the faintest chance of your going in April . I simply wo n't have the money . " " Daddy ! Only ninety dollars ! You could send me the rest later . Only ninety dollars , Daddy ! " " Virginia , you may not know it , but with things as they are , ninety dollars is by no means a trifle . If ninety dollars were the end of it , I wo n't pretend that it could n't be managed . But , my dear , it 's not . The sum you first named would n't be a beginning . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and usually three . I absolutely can not afford to add that way to our expenses at the moment . In a year or two  --  " " Listen , Ginny , do n't you even know there 's a depression on ? " Virginia sat down tense on the edge of a chair . " Daddy , please ! Please ! I would n't ask you if ? " " You might as well ask me for the moon , my dear . I have n't got it . If , in a year or two , things look better , I promise you I 'll manage somehow to make it possible for you to spend a year in Paris , if you still want to . You 'll be older then , and your mother may not object so much . Now , now ; economic necessity is insensible to tears ! That 's why the poor are always with us . " " Do n't be so rotten and selfish , Ginny ! " said Guy . " You ought to be ashamed of yourself , sitting here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris , when God knows how many million people do n't know where their next meal 's coming from ! " " Well , son , " said Mr. Banning , " that sounds like a social conscience ! Is it a permanent improvement , or are you just experimenting with it to add to your sister 's  | troubles ? " He came over , drew a handkerchief from his breast pocket and put it in Virginia 's hands . " Ca n't we keep this from your mother ? You see , even if she were to consent , we could n't manage it . No need to have a difference of opinion over what we would or would not do if we could . That 's a good girl . You just sit back in that chair out of the light and you 'll do ? " " Herbert ! " " Why , Lucile ! What is it ? " " Oh , my dear  --  that poor child ! Mary 's brother just came in . Mamie 's dead . "  | Two YEN Belle Rogers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he left . Walking to his car , there was not a light George Bull could see anywhere ; there was no one to see him . Under the dark hill of the barn , in tepid darkness , the cows maintained a vigil in their fashion ; some aimlessly standing ; some couched philosophic on the concrete . They were not bored ; probably they were not sad nor weary . If they heard the mortal gasps of the Devon dying near them , they knew by now that the noise did not mean anything worth attention . George Bull thought of it , oppressed , for the disgust of sobriety regained , and his body 's accumulated need to sleep , took the life out of his wakefulness . Leadenly , he was aware of himself alive , and so , heavy hearted , of death  --  of when he would no longer be what he now wearily was . The evil destinies of man and the immense triumphs of death , seen so clearly at this bad hour , loaded him down . Discouragement , to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of resisting such an adversary  --  what was the use of temporary evasions or difficult little remedies when death simply came back and came back until it won ? ? moved him more than any personal dread of extinction , or compassion for those stricken . The stricken , beyond help , were beyond needing help .  | During the last forty years , fully a hundred human beings had actually died while he watched . He could n't recall one who gave signs of minding much ; they were too sick or too badly hurt to care . If they were conscious enough to know that they were alive , pain blurred their view ; they saw no good anywhere . They were not given peace to regret a lost future ; they were beyond desiring anything . In its melancholy way , the flesh , maligned mortality , took tender care of its own . It would never let the intolerable be long imposed ; the impossible was never required . George Bull thought : " The Bulls are long-lived . I might be here twenty years from now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathed in was raw , but less cold . Clammy , no longer bracing , the bitter windless dark of the valley suggested a wasteland , a country and climate unfitted to support human life . Getting down to them , the bright infrequent street lights of New Winton shone on desertion that could not have been greater had every house stood cold and empty , had every human being lain long dead . Awakening Saturday morning , he could see how well sleep had served him , how unreal the thoughts of his desolate home-coming had been . He could see , too , the rain waving in curtains across the hills , the mists hung low . That great disconsolation , that unhappy sense of death and vanity , was doubtless a barometric matter , a mere change in atmospheric pressure .

He heaved water up in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wallowed about , grunting and ' pulling . Sitting up , he spattered water far and wide . It " shook gleaming from his shoulders . On his chest and wide arms , the dark hair was spread flat in sleek , bedraggled Wisps . Snorting once more , he regained his voice , cheerful in a mounting sense of his well-being . Below , in the kitchen , Mrs. Cole and Susie Andrews , who were intermittently cating their own breakfasts and preparing his , could hear him being to sing again , a vibrating bass rumble of Adeste I ideles . Triumphant , at the top of his lungs , he handled the awkward English wording with agile malice . It made him think of bitter mornings , Michigan Christmases , maybe fifty years ago ; but he was never through being glad that they were over . " ? Lo ! He abhors not the Vir-r-gin 's womb . Ver-er-y Gah-hod ; begotten , not creaa-ted . . . . " He snorted and wallowed again ; he emerged , standing on his feet , caroling heartily : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , let us . . . " The whole house felt the distinct faint jar of his stepping onto the mat . Working with a towel , he interrupted or embellished his singing with whoops and hoots . Opening the door to go to his bedroom , he could smell the mixed upfloating odors of sausage and pancakes , wood smoke and coffee . The glimpse of rain on the spoiled snow , of soaked tree branches , gave new comfort to the warmth , a new savor to the fine smell of breakfast . He roared with pleasure ; he knew plenty of hymns . Dressed , coming downstairs , his voice preceded him  | like a herald : " Crown Him with many crowns , The Lamb upon His throne ; Hark ! how the heavenly anthem drowns . . . .

His office door was open and in the gloom there he could see Susie dusting , shuffling about in the slippers Mrs. Cole would make her put on instead of her wet shoes as soon as she came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bull !

" " Kenneth , where were you last night ? " " He was in Heaven , Aunt Myra . This is Eph 's boy , George . " " You 've no need to be telling me who you are , shouting around like that ! I heard you up in the bathroom . And I 'm not so sure Kenneth 's in Heaven , much as I hope he may be . Now , sit right down and start your breakfast . Susie does n't have to go to school today and we have all we can do this morning . " A place had been laid on the cleared end of the kitchen table , and she put a hand on his elbow , impelling him toward it . " Drink your orange juice ; and here 's your porridge . Where did I put that cream ? There . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready directly  --  and see you eat plenty before you go out on a day like this . " " Who says I 'm going out ? " " Oh .

Susie ! Did you hear about any one dying yesterday ? "  | " I heard Mamie Talbot died , Mrs. Cole . " " Maybe that 's it , then . " " Well , I 'm damned ! " said George Bull . " Died , did she ? I thought she 'd probably get through . Well , I will have to go out . It 's against the law to die around here without a certificate . All we need now 's the enabling legislation and we 'll live forever . " " George , you stop sitting there blaspheming and scoffing .

There 's the syrup , and I 'll have some more cakes in a minute ? " She stood still , arrested , cocking her head slightly . No sound could be heard in the house and she called out : " Susie ! You just keep out of those books of the Doctor 's . First thing you know you 'll be getting yourself into bad habits . March right out here and begin on the dishes ! " There was a pause , a succession of slight , furtive sounds , and Susie appeared . " I do n't ever touch anything of the Doctor 's , Mrs. Cole . I was just dusting the bookcases . " " Hm . That 's as it may be . It took you a long time . Now , there 's no more batter , George , and I 'll not mix more this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I never did see a man eat as much !

A man says , will you please hang up the receiver . " + Virginia Banning pushed her cold bare feet into slippers whose high sides were lined with rabbit fur . Over her pajamas she pulled a flannel bathrobe . Not sitting down , she bent to the dressing table mirror , tugged the comb twice through her sleep-tangled hair , drove in the single hairpin . Listless , she jabbed her finger over the end of an open lipstick and transferred the scarlet smear to her upper lip . Deepened by animosity and a sort of contempt , her blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I look lousy ! " she said aloud . She leaned a moment , supported by her clenched hand on the dressing-table top , held by this consuming , utterly hopeless abhorrence . She hated the slight hollows under the drawn , thin-looking skin of her cheeks . Her hair , fluffy without being curly , seemed to her the color of rat 's fur . The boy 's bathrobe , buttoned across her flat chest , was striped vertically in blue and gray . She had that left from her never-completed fall term at school . It was a regulation garment at Miss Keble 's . Severe , practical , it aborted drastically all individual , too-luxurious developments in negligee . " In one of these , " she remembered some one saying , " a girl would be safe even rooming with a Yale man . . . . " Her thought was deflected , for it had been an item in the credulous and absurd general sophistication of the  | school that youths from Yale were invariably passionate and dangerous . Like so many of the beliefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one was spoiled for Virginia . Although she really knew no Yale men except Guy , that was enough . She could see that Yale men were no more than that  --  just Guy . " God ! I 'd tear his eyes out ! " she said , forgetting even her hatred of her own face in the momentary hotter one for some hypothetical , essentially Guy-like youth putting purposeful hands on hcr . I Ier glance swept from the mirror , met the endless drenching fall of rain over the bare maples beyond the drive . A dissolving mess of snow clung , the white now gray with water , to the lawns . She jerked around , loathing the dismal day as much as she loathed men , for amounting to no more than they did ; and her own white face , for looking  --  she said it through her teeth  --  like something the cat brought in . In the hall , she heard her mother 's voice , mild and clear from her sitting room : " Virginia ? " " Yes , mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm not dressed . " " Well , darling , Val telephoned ; but please do n't plan to go out there . I may want you to go over to the Talbots ' with me this morning . " " Oh , Mother ! What for ? " " Virginia , I do n't see how you can be so heartless . " " I just ca n't stand Mrs. Talbot and that awful shack ? I if it would do any good ? " " I 'm sorry , darling ; but if it clears up at all , I think we will really have to go . And get your breakfast right  | away , dear . Mary has a great deal to do this morning . " Val had telephoned to learn about going to Paris , of course ; and , of course , too , there was n't anything about it . This distracting sense of nothing about anything , the length of minutes and hours of nothing  --  Virginia thought , screwing her eyes closed and gripping the stair rail : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school again ; I just ca n't stand it here ! " At once she thought further : " If I said I 'd go to school and try not to get fired , they 'd send me . Why could n't I have the same money to go to Paris with Val ? " In the dining room a fire was burning . Guy , clad in a tan camel's-hair sweater , knickerbockers , and an extremely old tweed jacket , was not through breakfast . He ate , as he did everything else , with an unconscious assurance . It might not be fair to say that Guy was pleased with himself , in the sense of taking active pleasure in counting over his own good qualities ; but at least he did n't worry about himself . He knew by now that he and his more intimate friends were right ; or , at any rate , he could easily see that people who differed conspicuously in dress or behavior , in ideals or attitudes , were , as far as his college was concerned , wrong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level , complete indifference . He did not know them and never expected to . His face , past adolescence , coming into final form , showed the mold of this ruthless rightness . Virginia supposed some people might think he was good looking . " Hello , " she said . Guy got to his feet , mechanically . " Hoyt girl called you up , " he announced . " I know . " Virginia went to the pantry door , pushed it open , and called , " Mary , could I have some coffee ? " She came back to the table and sat down .  | " Cheerful child , " observed Guy . " You ought to ? " " Ca n't you even let me get some coffee first ? And what 's there to be cheerful about ? Mamie 's passing-out party ? " Guy 's face showed the delicate , haughty stiffening which indicated outrage . " For Heaven 's sake , Ginny , does n't any one matter to you but yourself ? " " I suppose you mean that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't even have to go over . You 'll fool around with your wonderful car all morning . " " At least I have the decency to be sorry . " " That 's cheap , I guess . What 's it to Mamie ? She 's dead , is n't she ? Who would n't rather be dead than living in a hole like New Winton ? " " You sound like a fool ! " " Oh , God , Guy ; let me alone , ca n't you ? " " Well , what have I done ? " " You just go yammering on about what people ought to do and what they ought to feel  --  who told you ? How do you know ? " " Well , what do you want to talk the way you do for ? " " Maybe I do n't want to . Maybe you make me . I wish you could hear yourself sometime ? At least I have the decency to be sorry ' ! " Guy reddened a little across his firm forehead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but at the same instant Mary came in and he shut it again . " Morning , Miss Ginny , " Mary said . She sat down a small silver coffee pot and a covered dish of toast . " Now , just let me boil you a couple of nice eggs ? " " I could n't eat them , Mary . I only want coffee . " Guy , the edge gone off his anger , said : " Half your trouble is never eating anything ? "  | " Mary , please do n't fix me any eggs . " Her hand shook a little as she lifted the coffee pot , and Guy , observing it , now that the door was closed behind Mary , said : " Look at that ! It 's just plain starvation . They ought to send you down to Doctor Verney ? " " Guy , for Christ 's sake , leave me alone ! " " With pleasure ! " He snapped a flame up on a leathercovered lighter , lit a cigarette and got to his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hear yourself sometime . You ca n't open your mouth without swearing . If you think that sort of thing is smart , I can tell you it is n't . You sound exactly like a West Haven chippy . I do n't care whether you eat anything . If you want to be a living skeleton ? " He went past her , out into the hall . Virginia stared straight before her , at the disordered table , the frilling yellow flames up off the orange embers in the fireplace . Her hand was trembling so that she could n't pour , and she put down the silver pot . She had her teeth locked together and now she clenched her hands ; but it was not going to do her any good . The short , strangling gasps of sobs , unwanted , unendurable , strengthened in spite of her . She pressed her palms over her wet eyes ; she bent her head down until it lay on the table . Now came the sudden swing of the pantry door , and Mary 's startled voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leave me alone ! " she wailed . " Leave me alone ! " +  | Mrs. Talbot had been difficult , of course . First , she would not sleep alone in a house with a dead body ; then , she seemed to see it as more Mamie and less corpse . She would not leave Mamie all night alone and sleep in May 's house . Harry Weems , coming back with a bottle of gin and some oranges had solved the problem by saying he would stay with Joe . Much as she disliked it , May was free to sleep over at Mrs. Talbot 's . Joe did n't care , as long as she got Mrs. Talbot out of his sight as soon as possible . Again , Harry had been invaluable . May had supper to get . Harry made a drink for Mrs. Talbot . Not too far sunk in her misery to feel that Joe was definitely hostile , Mrs. Talbot could n't have been managed without Harry . She kept saying : " Do n't mind me . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she said it in Joe 's direction , peevish and put-upon . Obviously Joe was unable to go to any trouble , but he might act as though he would like to , if he could . Still protesting that she really did n't want anything and needed no attention , she drank what I Tarry prepared for her . After that she recovered enough to eat a little . The gin and food joined , mercifully , to stupefy her . She was soon in danger of going to sleep right there , so May cleaned up in a hurry and stacked the dishes . Mrs. Talbot , taken home and helped to bed , was snoring almost at once , leaving everything to May . The place ought to be straightened up a little , since people would certainly be coming in tomorrow , so May applied herself to that . When she had done what she could with the front room , she hesitated a moment . " I must n't be silly , " she said , aloud . Turning on the light in the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of illness , chief might be the change in  | disposition , from which Joe , once perpetually smiling , good humoredly easy going , had suffered . He was the same person , and yet he was n't . Of the many cruelties of death , there was one like that . Mamie , living , had been regarded as pretty . Living , she had a youthfulness , or mere animation , which screened her resemblance to her mother . May had never noticed it ; and she stood , disturbed , for Mamie , dead , was a little Mrs. Talbot . Her nose looked slight as a knife . The bony structure of her face showing through was patterned exactly on Mrs. Talbot 's . Regarding this phenomenon of a face which was both Mamie , sick and thin , and some one else inextricably mingled with her , May continued to stand , her hands lax , overpowered by discouragement . She had wished , somehow , to arrange it so that curious people would see Mamie serenely asleep , not contorted and ravaged . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last struggles , so terrible as they grew more surely vain , to get air ; although unconscious in her stupor , to keep from drowning in her own clogged lungs . Any superficial arrangement would be futile . Whatever was done , Howard Upjohn would have to do ; and immediately May could guess details of that grim fantastic art  --  the work with rouge , the dressing of dead hair  --  which simulated peace or dignity in a corpse . When May finally moved , it was to draw back the twisted covers . The flannel nightgown had worked up to wrinkle about Mamie 's waist . It was possible to see , shockingly , the shape of hip bones through the wasted flesh ; the thighs were shrunk almost to bony pipes ; there were no calves left to the legs . Drawing down the nightgown ,  | May wondered if it would be possible to dress Mamie . Turning her over , hideous , wasted , hardly covered , to I Toward Upjohn seemed terrible ; but she could not see how it was to be helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making it lie as straight and smooth as she could , turned out the light . Mrs. Talbot was still snoring in the front bedroom . There was nothing left to do but wrap herself in the blanket which she had brought over with her and lie down on the broken springs of the couch . May , too , slept . At seven Harry Weems ran over through the rain and woke her up . Joe said : " Hell ! Look at it rain ! I bet Louie wo n't come over . " " He will , " promised May . She went to the window , looking out to see if any one were approaching Mrs. Talbot 's house . " I 'll go and tell him he 's got to . " " I 'll tell him , " said Harry . " I want to go over anyway . Thanks for breakfast . So long , Joe . Be seeing you . " May followed him out through the kitchen to the back door . " Make Louie promise , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess you know I 'll do anything I can , May . Listen , some one ought to telephone Doc Bull about coming down . They 'll have to have a death certificate for Mamie . Want me to do it ? " " Will you ? And you wo n't forget about Louie ? " Louie came from his barber shop over by the station on  | Tuesdays and Saturdays to shave Joe . He had started by doing it free . After a month or so , he became , like every one except Harry , less enthusiastic . May said she thought that he ought to be paid . He had n't objected , except to remark that a quarter would be enough for both times . On the whole , it was better to have it arranged that way . In a life like Joe 's , Louie 's coming to shave him was an event of the first importance . May felt freer about seeing that Louie did come , when it was n't just a favor . Joe would be feeling depressed enough on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She said , " Joe , I 'll have to go back to get Mrs. Talbot some coffee . You do n't mind , do you ? " Joe said : " Sure , I mind . But it do n't do me any good . " He was still surly , oppressed by the weather and the chance that Louie might not come . " Why ca n't you let some one else do something ? I do n't see that it 's any of your business . Why do n't you let her alone ? " " I 'll come back as soon as I can , Joe . I just want to wait until Doc Bull gets down and they decide what they 're going to do . " " What they ought to do , is put her in the nut house over at Middletown , " Joe said . " She gets crazier all the time ? " " I meant , about Mamie , " May said . " Joe , do you want your bottle again before I go ? " " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think I am ? The town reservoir ? "  | To give mere curiosity pause was this ceaseless fall of rain , this dreary , abominable day . To interfere with mere sympathy was Mrs. Talbot herself . Mrs. Talbot had been in miserable want too long . Her poverty approximated a disease ; it might be catching . Living on what was called the back street , near the railroad , behind the houses fronting the east of the green , Mrs. Talbot 's immediate neighbors were all poor . They struggled to maintain a pinched and difficult self-respect . By keeping their bills small , they managed to pay them , and so to make their poverty their own business . This was the only luxury possible to them ; prizing it , they did not practice the sympathetic fellowship of those poor beyond hope in the squalor of big cities . Because it was well known that Mrs. Talbot would borrow , but could never lend herself , or even return , they must exclude her . They could even exclude her with bitterness . Themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flour or sugar , they could be indignant that Mrs. Talbot should dare to need them when , had she chosen to go without a telephone , used for no practical purpose at all beyond interminable whining conversations with her brother 's widow who did housework for the Herrings at Banning 's Bridge , she might be that , at least , ahead . Nobody knew how much money she had been allowed to owe Bates . The clerks would not let her have anything more , but , by appealing to Mr. Bates , she could and did add to the debt . Mr. Bates , cornered , assented at once , trying sadly to stop her explanations ; blinking at her as though he hoped that she might change into somebody else and spare him , not the small loss of goods , but the great ordeal of doing what he was a fool to do . His daugh-  | ter , Geraldine , coming out of the post office , or any one of his clerks , would promptly start what Mr. Bates meekly called , giving him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy food . All of Mrs. Talbot 's neighbors at some time or another found it necessary to owe Mr. Bates money . Laboriously , they paid it to the last penny . It was hard to see Mrs. Talbot never paying , nor ever likely to . Mrs. Andrews , peering from a curtained window perhaps a hundred feet away beyond a fragment of picket fence , could not take the risk of visiting Mrs. Talbot . Others , farther along the street , but well aware of what was going on , felt the same . Mrs. Talbot , asked if there were anything they could do , would certainly say yes . She would need things which they could not afford to give . Like Mrs. Andrews , peeping restlessly , they were all illat-ease , distressed by their own unkind prudence . The only solace was that May Tupping appeared to be able , or at least , willing , to bear the brunt , to act for all in the role of neighbor . May , they could reflect , got a regular salary from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Talbot would not be the ones nearest at hand . The first one who did come was Mrs. Jackson . May , looking anxiously out the front window for Doctor Bull 's car , saw Mrs. Jackson at the back door of the plain but very neat , brightly red-painted little building which was the New Winton branch of Gosselin Bros . Mrs. Jackson had a basket covered with newspaper on her arm . In clean white apron and coat , a cap bearing Gosselin 's entwined  | scarlet monogram tilted on his head , her husband , who was the manager , stood in out of the rain , putting up her umbrella for her . By chance seeing this , May could not imagine where Mrs. Jackson was going , as she trudged straight across the back . Mrs. Jackson had gained the road , gone over it carefully through the puddles and softening mud , and May still did n't guess . The Jacksons were n't New Winton people . Gosselin Bros. simply waved a hand , and up sprang the scarlet store , windows covered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 lbs . rgc ; Fancy Salt Pork lb. 15C-It was swept and spotless , backed by elaborate refrigerators , blazing with electric light , walled solidly with the profusion of brightly packed goods put down once or twice a week by Gosselin ten-ton trucks . Every item was three or seven or thirteen cents cheaper than the same thing at Bates ' or Upjohn 's . Mr. Jackson , with his apron , coat and cap fresh every morning , seemed as much part of the fixtures as the refrigerators . What was regarded as the unfairness of Gosselin 's competition caused the Jacksons to be let alone socially , as though the people who could not resist trading there wished to pretend that they did n't . The last person in New Winton who might be expected to come was Mrs. Jackson . May , astounded , saw her walk deliberately up the ill-kept cinder path . Turning , May called : " Mrs. Talbot , Mrs. Jackson is coming in . " News so surprising should certainly draw a response , and getting none , May went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeat , she stopped , shocked . " Why , Mrs. Talbot , what 's the matter ? " There was really no need to ask . May could see that  | Mrs. Talbot must have decided to let go again . Sitting on the bed , she had brought her feet up , clasped her hands about her knees and laid her forehead against them . The posture , so suggestive of a terrible despair , and so absurd , almost jaunty in its youthful flexibility , irritated May nearly as much as it disturbed her . She went and took Mrs. Talbot by the shoulder . " If you do n't feel well , you just lie down , " she said , " but you ca n't sit there like that . Mrs. Jackson 's coming up the path now . " Thus urged , half forced , by May 's impatient hand , Mrs. Talbot moved , turning and putting her feet on the floor . " Seems like I ca n't get any peace , " she said with unexpected harshness . " What 's that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and knocked on it . Mrs. Talbot , starting , seemed to weaken . " I do n't believe I want to see her , May . I ? " " She wo n't stay long , Mrs. Talbot . I think she 's bringing you some things . " " No , none of them stay . They all get out as quick as they can . I do n't have anybody who cares ? " " Now , Mrs. Talbot , that 's not true ? " Since nothing could have been truer , May saved herself by rushing out to the door . " Come in , Mrs. Jackson . There , let me take your umbrella . " Mrs. Jackson seemed to be in an anguish of embarrassment . " Oh , how do you do , Mrs. Tupping , " she faltered . " My , is n't it a mean day ! I just want to tell Mrs. Talbot how awful sorry Malcolm and I are about her bereavement . I just know how awfully she feels . I just thought I might bring her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I thought some things that would n't need cooking ? " Agitated , she pulled off the wet newspapers covering  | the basket . May could see a ham , and at least a dozen cans of various sorts and sizes . Mr. Jackson could get them at cost , of course , but even so that basketful came to money . May found herself almost as embarrassed as Mrs. Jackson . " Oh , that 's kind of you ? " she said . " Well , I just thought  --  my sister-in-law had a little girl die when we lived in Bayonne , New Jersey . At such a time , it just does n't seem as if you could do anything , and ? " Mrs. Jackson was still floundering , dismayed by the difficulties which she had nervously foreseen . She could n't quite manage the assured , sympathetic patronage of her less fortunate neighbors . Mrs. Tupping , who was actually nothing but a thin blonde girl , came in her civil reserve closer to patronizing Mrs. Jackson . Mrs. Talbot herself had n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what to do with Mrs. Jackson , formerly of Bayonne , New jersey , even when she brought gifts . Mrs. Jackson , hazily in her own mind envisioning the opportunity of saying to Mrs. Vogel , or Mrs. Ely , or both , that she had just felt that she ought to do something for that poor Mrs. Talbot over on the back street , saw that it would not mean what she thought . Mrs. Tupping and poor Mrs. Talbot would have known what to do with the Vogels or Elys . They went just a shade under Bates , Ordway , Quimby , Harris , Weems , Upjohn ; a shade over , Talbot , Tupping , Clark , Webster , Foster , Andrews . Since no one , by his behavior , gave the faintest sign of considering himself inferior to any one else , these were subtleties you had to recognize by long acquaintance . Mrs. Jackson was not being recognized as anything ; no one had taken her in and so given her a level and a place which every  | one else could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fell whose husband owned the meat market were the ones she seemed to be thrown with , but they did not treat her as though the things that interested them could be expected to interest her . They did not ask about her or tell her about themselves . Thus she was greatly confused when she had learned for the first time ( months after she had been acting as neighborly as she could ) that the Vogels were n't German , in the sense of being born in Europe , the way every one with a foreign-sounding name was in Bayonne . They had been right there for a hundred and fifty years , descendants of the foremen of the old furnace . You had to live here all your life to know , with that perfect assurance , all these things about everybody . There was not one woman in town who called Mrs. Jackson by her Christian name , or offered to share anything but the most superficial and impersonal gossip with her . May , seeing Mrs. Jackson 's disappointment , though not clearly over what , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Talbot , " she called , " I want to show you the lovely things Mrs. Jackson brought . " Mrs. Talbot groaned , for the first time audible . " Yes , May , I 'm coming . " She put in her bedraggled appearance , holding the door jamb . " I 'm sure it 's very kind of you , Mrs. Jackson . I thank you very much . " Mrs. Jackson gathered herself together . " I do n't want to intrude at a time like this , " she said , " I just wanted to tell you how awfully sorry Malcolm and I ? " " Yes , that 's very nice of you , " said Mrs. Talbot without conviction . " I think you 'd better lie down again , Mrs. Talbot , " suggested May , blushing at the listlessness of the acknowl-  | edgment . The sound of a motor coming to a halt outside reached her and she said : " I believe that 's Doctor Bull now . You lie down , Mrs. Talbot , and before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , I will . I do n't feel very good , if Mrs. Jackson will excuse me . " " Yes , of course . I just wanted to ? " There was a rap on the door and May went to it . " Oh , " she said , much relieved , " Mrs. Bates . Do come in . Hello , Gerry . " Geraldine Bates carried this basket . " Want me to put the junk out in the kitchen , May ? " she asked . She glanced briefly at Mrs. Jackson and nodded . " Oh , how do you do , Mrs. Jackson , " said Mrs. Bates , surprised . " Is n't the weather terrible ! May , I 'll just speak to Mrs. Talbot a moment and we 'll go along . " She lowered her voice . " Howard been over yet ? " " No , he has n't , Mrs. Bates . We 're still waiting for Doctor Bull . " " My goodness , has n't he been here at all ? " " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here when it happened ? " " No , he was n't . " " Well , I do call that dreadful ! " " Oh , my , " agreed Mrs. Jackson . " That is terrible , is n't it ? " " Did n't anybody call him , May ? " " He was out all afternoon , Mrs. Bates . I expect he was on another case , and Mrs. Cole had gone to Sansbury . " " Well , why did n't some one try to get Doctor Verney ? " " Doctor Verney wo n't take any calls up here , except for  | the Bannings , Mrs. Bates . He always says he simply ca n't do it . " " Well , it 's really an outrage ! Doctor Bull has n't any right to go gadding about when he has a patient as sick as Mamie . It is n't as if it were the first time , either . " " Oh , " said Geraldine wearily , " I guess everybody knows he 's a bum doctor by now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you need n't be so impertinent , " Mrs. Bates told her . " Honestly , May , I think something ought to be done to make George Bull realize his responsibilities . " " Yes , I do think you 're right , " said Mrs. Jackson , attempting to seize an opening . " Mrs. Ely was telling me about the case of that boy at Truro who had diphtheria ? " " There are plenty of cases , " said Mrs. Bates flatly . " I suppose nothing can be done now , but there ought to be a law ? " " Sh ! " whispered May , " I think he 's coming . " " I declare , I would n't mind telling him to his face . It 's his duty to take care of the sick in this town , and ? " The door opened , admitting Howard Upjohn , his long face very solemn , and Mr. Banning . Mr. Banning said at once : " How do you do , Mrs. Bates . Good morning , May . Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geraldine . " Howard Upjohn said generally , " Morning . ' Lo , May . Doc Bull here yet ? " " Not yet , " said May . " Then we 'll just have to wait , I guess . Hermann Vogel said he 'd be over and lend me a hand in about twenty minutes . What 's keeping the Doc ? " " May , " said Mr. Banning , " will you ask Mrs. Talbot if she feels able to see me a moment ? "  | " Why , of course , Mr. Banning , " May nodded . " I 'll just ask her ? " The change in atmosphere had become instantly apparent . Every eye , every interest , had transferred to the person who had the means , and it now could be guessed , the intention to pay . After he had gone in , May , withdrawing beyond the door , could hear fragments of Mr. Banning 's lowered voice : " Mrs. Talbot . . . our deepest sympathy . I hope you will . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ask Howard to come here a moment ? " Mrs. Talbot had begun abruptly to sniffle , doubtless forgetting that last night her idea had been to revile and abuse the Bannings as the whole cause of her misfortune . Howard Upjohn , entering to stand by the bed , too , was nodding with reflective consideration . May could n't blame him for being cheered to know that the expenses of burying Mamie would unquestionably be paid . Mrs. Talbot , in a teary unsteadiness of gratitude , got out a few , high , very clearly carried phrases : " . . . do n't know how to ? " and " . . . never be able to ? " In the front room , Geraldine Bates was looking , with obvious amazement , at the contents of Mrs. Jackson 's basket ; but Mrs. Jackson and Mrs. Bates were both tense , listening as hard as possible . Mr. Banning was going to pay , and in a reluctant , tortuous way , they both resented it , while both tried not to . To Heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this earth , you had to see that the widow was merely absurd . What weighed in the scale of mercy and human happiness were the rich men casting their gifts . Mr. Banning came and with his good , kind money , in one gesture swept away all common difficulties and pulled Mrs. Talbot from the pit . May saw Mrs. Bates  | looking at Mrs. Jackson , their slight constraint for the moment forgotten . Mrs. Jackson gave quick lip-service to Mr. Banning 's virtue : " My , that 's mighty nice of him ? " Mrs. Bates , living all her life in the shadow of the Bannings ' prestige and high fortunes , said dryly : " Well , I think people ought to help according to their means and abilities . " " Come on , Ma , " said Geraldine . " Let 's go . " On the outer door a heavy hand fell . The door opened then , showing them Doctor Bull 's bold red face and massive figure . " Good morning , " he said , glancing down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag on the table , shrugged off his raincoat and laid it on a chair with his wet hat . " Well , this is too bad , is n't it . Where 's Mrs. Tal-bot ? " " She 's in there , talking to Mr. Banning and Mr. Upjohn , " Mrs. Bates said . " Right , " nodded Doctor Bull . " Well , May ! Tell your husband I 'll try to stop in and see him this afternoon . " He stood in the bedroom door . His voice boomed . " Hello , Banning . Hello , Howard . Very sorry to hear about this , Mrs. Talbot . I 'll just look at her , please . All right , Howard , come along . " Carrying his bag he went to the closed door of the back bedroom . " Why did n't you tell him that stuff you were going to , Ma ? " whispered Geraldine . " Geraldine , you just keep still ? " They all stood waiting , and now Doctor Bull came out again , tucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table where he pushed things aside . Sitting down , he took his fountain pen and spread out a printed form . Mrs. Bates , reddening , said rather weakly : " Pity  | you could n't get here yesterday afternoon . I suppose you might have saved her . " " Not likely , " said Doctor Bull , continuing to write . " It 's really a self-limiting infection . There are a good many types of the pneumococcus . If it happens to be type one , there 's a serum some think helps . I do n't believe it . Seventy per cent of the cases recover anyway , so how can you prove the serum did it ? Probably you either have the stamina to hang on while you develop resistance , or else you have n't . Mamie had n't . Too puny . Girl like Geraldine would probably pull through fine . Got some meat on her . Well , that 's all I guess . When 's the funeral going to be ? " " Why , I do n't know ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned his bright , cheerfully contemptuous blue eyes on her . May came across the room . " Doctor Bull , " she said , " do you think you could do anything for Mrs. Talbot ? She 's so upset , I mean ; and ? " " Did she sleep last night ? " " Why , yes . " " How do you know ? " " I was over here . " " Well , then there 's nothing to be done now . She 'll be all right . She might be better if some of you cleared out . It keeps her worked up . Probably she does n't feel like doing much , so if you want to help , take her over to your place and give her lunch , Mrs. Bates . You have a car out there . " Mrs. Bates , taken by surprise , hesitated , reddening again with embarrassment , for it was one thing to look in at Mrs. Talbot 's , and another to have that dirty creature  | at your table . With accounts thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or do n't , if you do n't like the idea . Just trying to suggest some way you could help . Get the body out as soon as you can , Howard . Not a very cheerful thing to have around . " Mr. Banning had come out now . He stood erect and precise , pulling his gloves on . Doctor Bull thrust his big hands into the sleeves of his slicker , humped his shoulders into it , clapped his hat on . " Decided when the funeral 's going to be , Banning ? " " Mrs. Talbot wishes to have it Tuesday , Doctor . We 'll have to consult the Rector about the time . " " Oh . That 's right . Mamie was an Episcopalian , was n't she ? I forgot . The Talbots were always Congregationalists in the old days . I 'd have probably gone to the wrong church . " He opened the door , stepping out into the rain . Mr. Banning nodded to the women , following him . On the path , he said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll be glad to settle it . " " All right , Banning , " said Doctor Bull with relish . " I 'll be glad to have it settled . " + Upstairs in Upjohn 's Hall three rooms looked out , one long window apiece , on the open triangle behind the New Winton station . Each corner room had an extra window , 11 one north , one south . The three shabby varnished doors on the little hall had been lettered in black paint : Town Clerk ; Auditor ; Collector of Taxes . Clarence Upjohn ,  | who had been Town Clerk , no matter what other officials changed around him , for seventeen years , donated the rooms , rent free . A meager sarcasm , living on from the time of Clarence 's first offer of them and the lettering of the doors , described the arrangement as City Hall . Except when the Board of Relief met ; or ballots , cast downstairs , were counted ; or Clarence was moved to bring over a week or two 's work as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Upjohn Brothers ' store across the street  --  to file in the fireproof record cabinets with which the south room was lined , no one bothered about City Hall , or had any reason to come up there . Henry Harris , Collector of Taxes , used and discussions . The furniture of this room had arrived there only after it had been thrown out somewhere else . There was a tumble-down easy chair , variously ruptured , with bulges of strangulated stuffing , where Henry Harris sat to think . An unsteady table stood under the electric light , a bare bulb hanging on a wire in the center . Two straight-backed wooden chairs had legs of slightly different lengths . In a shabby open bookcase thirteen or fourteen worn volumes of the Connecticut Code sprawled along the top shelf . Below were a few old issues of the State Register &; Manual , a couple of reprints of novels ten years past their popularity , an obsolete unabridged dictionary with the binding torn off and a large collection of pulp-paper magazines , mostly without covers . Over the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color print . Obviously it had been turned out , frame and all , in quantity and distributed without charge . A brass plate screwed to the frame bore  | the words : Armorial Bearings of State of Connecticut ? the white rococo shield ; the three supported grape vines , each dangling four leaves and three purple clusters ; the contorted , gold-edged streamer : Qui Transtulit Sustinet . While Henry Harris had been making sure that no one was in any of the other rooms , Lester Dunn , everything else profitlessly examined , stood studying the streamer . " What the hell does that mean ? " he inquired . " Means : who set us up here will take care of us , " said Henry Harris , unhurried . " Oh , " agreed Lester Dunn , " I always wondered . There must have been a nice little graft about handing out all those free pictures . " Unhurried , too , he transferred his attention to the fly-specked campaign poster on the other wall ; the Republican eagles and two large oval photographs with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Hoover and Curtis . " Applesauce ! " said Lester Dunn , reflectively . Henry Harris had lighted the little round oil heater , but he was still busy adjusting the wick , trying to minimize the inevitable stink . Lester moved to the north window , looking out at the rain over the long low roof of the building which housed the New Winton Volunteer Fire Department 's truck ; over soggy backyards , to the little street beyond and the small houses scattered along it . " Having quite a show at the Talbots ' , " he remarked . " There 's Bates ' car , and Banning 's , and Doc Bull 's . Say , I 'll bet it 's some wake , if Mrs. Banning is in there with the Doc . " " Do n't worry . She would n't come out on a day like this . She sent her Herbert . " " What for ? " " Fix it up to bury Mamie . He was over talking to  | Howard and they picked out a nice medium-priced coffin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Going to order a stone , too . Something in simple good taste . " " There comes Doc Bull now , and Banning right with him . Look just like old pals . When do they bury her ? " " If this weather keeps up , it ought to be thawed out enough to get her in Monday . " " Maybe they could borrow one of those thawing machines from the construction camp . " " The camp 's leaving us this coming Friday . I guess they 're getting kind of sick of it . I saw Harry Weems slipping one of their men a little something yesterday . " " You see a lot , do n't you ? " " Try to keep my eyes open , Lester . Good deal goes on around here when you know where to look . " Lester dropped into the armchair . " Come on , " he said . " Let 's hear it . " " Listen , do n't wreck that ! I want it a while yet . " " It was wrecked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Oh , nothing much . What did you get from Doc Bull for finding out about where Larry dumped the Bannings ' junk ? " " Five dollars . " Henry Harris whistled . " With all that in your pants , you probably would n't be interested in picking up small change . " He sat down and filled his pipe carefully . " Come on ! " said Lester . " Well , it would only amount to about a hundred dollars for you . " " I could use it . "  | " So could Hermann Vogel or Grant Williams . Maybe Harry Weems would just as soon have it . " " And now I 'll tell you . Hermann and Grant are so dumb you do n't want them . Harry makes all the money he wants selling liquor . So if you need a constable , I guess , it 'll have to be me . " " I do n't know . I might be able to influence Harry a little . How would he like a couple of Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's see you get one ! All those boys who are n't bought and paid for , if there are any , are running around Bridgeport and Hartford and New Haven with their tongues hanging out . Every time they raid one place two more open up . Think they 're going to come way up here to catch the village bootlegger ? " " They get around on a hot enough tip . " " Listen , I have n't said I would n't do it . What is it ? " " Just a minute . Did you hear somebody come in downstairs then ? " " No . That was a shutter swinging . What are you so jumpy about ? This must be pretty hot . " " I 'm not jumpy , " Henry Harris said placidly . " I 'm just careful . Well , matter of fact , Lester , you 're the one I want , all right . I need somebody smart . But try not to be too smart , will you ? I can do this without you ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not breaking the law . Absolutely not . You 're perfectly safe ; and nobody can say anything to you . So how about settling it at a hundred dollars . I 'll pay you cash . " He got a wallet from his back pocket and began to drop ten dollar bills on the table . " There you are . " " This must be something , " said Lester . " I 'm probably  | a damn fool , but make it a hundred and fifty and I 'll do it , short of murder . " " Did n't I tell you it was n't breaking the law ? Matter of fact , it 's just doing your sworn duty . Nobody can say a word . " " Sold for one hundred and fifty . " They gazed a moment at each other . " Well , I used to hear in church you had n't ought to muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn , " said Henry Harris . He counted five more bills , pushed them all across the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that , " said Lester . " But all right , shoot . I 'll do it . " " You 're a smart chap , " smiled Henry Harris . " Get your profits in advance every time . Never can tell when something will slip up . " " I 'm plenty smart enough to come in when it rains , " agreed Lester , " but you 're the smartest damn bastard in the county , and I know right now I 'm being a boob not to say two hundred . " Henry Harris had been the smartest boy in the New Winton school . His father , Jacob Harris , rewarded him with the begrudged gift of his parental permission ; the School Committee arranged about his railroad fares ; and Henry Harris became the smartest boy in the then-new High School at Sansbury . He was a feather in New Winton 's rustic cap . Whether or not Henry Harris would have been the smartest young man at Yale was never determined . Jacob  | Harris thought that this had gone far enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played by the fact that Paul Banning 's boy was at Yale . Like Jacob Harris , Paul Banning called himself a farmer , but in his case , other men did the farming . Paul Banning 's personal approach to the soil was on the trotting tracks of the big eastern fairs . He had bred at least two pacers famous enough for the immortality of those sporting lithographs found in country hotel lobbies and the harness rooms of city stables . He was , of course , a rich man ; and so had his father been . Even his grandfather , while he did his own farming , had done it with a simple , patriarchal authority , directing many laborers on the best and biggest farm in New Winton . Jacob Harris was a real farmer , a poor one . Yale was obviously a place for rich men 's sons . By this Jacob Harris did not mean to be ordering himself lowly and reverently to all his betters ; in his opinion , his betters did not exist . He meant that college was suitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did n't believe Herbert Banning could load so much as one hay wagon without dropping dead . Like many smart people , Henry Harris had always been a realist . The qualities of plainness , poverty unashamed , had their value mainly in his father 's mind . Few people , able to be disinterested , saw them as the fine things Jacob Harris said they were . Henry Harris saw better the Banning stables  --  they had not burned down until after old Paul 's death in 1908 ? stretched beside the green . The building was as long as three barns ; and to prove it , carried three graceful cupolas , each vaned with a small gold horse trotting up the wind . A strip of sward as carefully kept as a lawn separated the permanently closed east doors  | from the road along the green . It was the biggest and , to the small Henry Harris , passing it every day on his way to school , the most beautiful thing in New Winton . If he were smart enough to see , by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hay wagon compared to the money to hire all the good loaders you wanted who worked while you sat at ease , he was also smart enough to see , after a while , that Yale was less important to him than Yale had appeared in his hopes and first harsh disappointment . Of course , it was impossible not to feel an envious pang when Herbert Banning came home from college with a boating straw banded in Yale colors on his head ; wearing a pale gray suit with narrow trousers and a double-breasted coat elegantly ample and padded on the shoulders ; smoking a pipe with a curved stem and Y ' 04 inlaid in silver on the bowl ; but all that took money . Henry Harris guessed that , poor as he would have been at Yale , he would not profit , except perhaps academically . The intelligence that made him a good scholar showed him too that scholarship was rarely of any importance in this world . The adjustment did not mean that he forgave his father or Herbert Banning  --  the one for thwarting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first major ambition of Henry 's life ; the other , for enjoying as a matter of course what Henry had wanted so passionately and in vain . Here were two accounts to be settled . For the moment he could not pay anything on them , and he did not waste time trying to or wishing that he could . Perhaps one of them was settled when Jacob Harris died without ever enjoying the ease which the prospering Henry , for appearance ' sake , would soon have been forced to provide for  | him . Henry Harris let it go at that ; all his energies were given to the problem of making money . To make money , most young men might have thought it necessary to leave New Winton , where a dollar was seen in its true light  --  the certificate exchanged for a man 's work all day  --  and where there existed no loose surplus for the gaining or wasting . Such a step is often praised as showing the vision and courage which brings success . Henry Harris had something better than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to serve him . He answered an advertisement about raising turkeys for profit . Raising them , he made money , exactly as the advertisement said that he would . When he had made a thousand dollars , he persuaded Isaac Quimby to let him buy into Quimby 's feed , grain , and coal business . Once in , he began to consume Quimby by insisting on his privilege to reinvest his profits . Eventually they were large enough for him to stop that and begin to take a hand in Sansbury real estate . This is perfectly simple to see and tell about ; but most men , trying it , meet with every possible ill chance . Turkeys can pine and die . Mr. Quimby would have fleeced some presumptuous youths . Others would have plunged ignorantly in Sansbury building lots and lost everything . Doubtless luck is the chief factor , but , dispassionately considered , almost every financially unlucky person is a plain fool to start with . Henry Harris had that cleverness which is the very touch of Midas . He knew how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he used could be seen when he first entered village politics . He threw in his lot with the helpless and disorganized Democratic minority .  | At the time it was not possible for Democrats to win locally . Henry Harris never expected them to . He meant to live on the Republicans . Other candidates worked hard and worried for the small offices ; but not Henry Harris . He was a Democrat . It was considered good policy to let the Democrats have one job . Republican voters might or might not elect this or that Republican candidate , but Henry Harris , the leading Democrat , was always elected . The next step in this old American story is transferral to a larger town , to a city ; to state , then national politics . More than once it has ended only when some Henry Harris became President of the United States . Henry Harris would not be blind to the glitter of the chance , nor deaf to the thunder of opportunity awakening Democrats about 1910 . He had all the qualifications . As well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean shrewdness by which alone a man can climb , not too visibly soiled , through the sewer-like lower labyrinth of American politics . Henry Harris had , too , the bland , impregnable assurance required to rule on top . Close-mouthed , sitting smiling on the steps of Bates ' store in his old clothes , it might seem that sloth had stopped Henry Harris ; but he was a thoughtful man and never an idle one . He might have reflected that here his time was his own , his money already ample to buy him everything he saw any reason to want . Out of what life has , Henry Harris lacked , in fact , only fame . Sensible though he might be to the violent pleasures found in overtaking and enjoying her , the whore , Fame , he did not follow . Musing , far-sighted and reflective , owing no explanation to any one , he was apt enough at analogy . Like the girls at Maggie 's in Bridgeport , Fame was at the end of a trip ,  | inconvenient , tedious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bridgeport , for he could see a bargain ; and the short satisfaction of lewd dalliance , exchanged for a considerable expenditure of time and money , and a week of waiting to see if he had got gonorrhoea , made no bargain . National politics might be much like a trip to Maggie 's . Henry Harris was smiling now , watching Lester fold the ten dollar bills into a pocket book . Henry Harris ' face , saturnine , almost morose in abstraction , changed altogether when he smiled . Seen carelessly , it was a smile of rare , intelligent warmth . Attracted by it , many people would never notice or understand the gleam of a puckish , merry spite , an indulgent malevolence in Henry Harris ' dark eyes . The warmth was genuine . It was the inner warmth he felt while he surveyed the good order of his plans and resources . Reticent , dangerously smiling , he had taken loving pains with them . Each little plan was a work of art . He had perfected it ; he had subjected it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and condition . He would get no surprises when it went into action . Other people were the surprised ones . As much as success  --  and here perhaps lay a clew to the compensations of his simple , satisfactory life  --  Henry Harris could relish that familiar start of first blank surmise , the following quick or slow realization in his victims . Calm , steadily smiling out his unassailable relish , enjoying the belated twistings and fatally late quick-thinkings , he received ob-  | jections , threats and insults as so much tribute . Knowing it , Henry Harris was modest about it ; he never tried to make the fact that he was the smarter man appear in casual conversation . Any one could talk . Most people , if they kept trying , could score small triumphs of repartee . Henry Harris , rarely rejoining , could wait , foretasting the fine jovial day when his enemies themselves would , by their own confounding , speak , even roar , the proofs of his wit . He said , " Hand me down that last volume of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . I 'm fixing up a little surprise for Matthew Herring . He takes such good care of the town money , he probably wo n't like it , but I doubt if he can help himself . " " Say , what are you going to do ? " " I 'm going to try an old Fairfield County dodge , Lester . I do n't claim the credit . Down there , they 've been doing it for years . They thought it up for the mill town Polacks . Lot of those people do n't read English very well , so they never know when taxes are due . When are taxes due in New Winton , Lester ? " " Why , I guess , about March fifteenth . " " Smart lad ! And if you have n't paid up on or before that date what happens ? " " Nothing I ever heard of , so long as the town knows you and you pay pretty soon . " Henry Harris fingered the pages of the open volume . " Yes , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of shiftless . " He shook his head . " Well , it 's never too late to reform . I read here that it happens to be the duty of the Collector of Taxes to swear out warrants promptly for all delinquents . There 's a two dollar fee for him ; there 's a five dollar fee for the constable serving the warrant . How  | many people do you think we might catch napping the morning of March sixteenth ? " " Oh , come to papa ! " groaned Lester , falling back in the easy chair . " I knew I was a sucker ! But , Henry , I 'll have to hand it to you . Why , I bet we could catch a hun-dred ! " " About what I figured , " Henry Harris agreed . " I ? " He stopped short , his face stiffening . On the panel of the closed door heavy knuckles had struck suddenly . Lester started with such violence that he stood on his feet while the door swung open . " Good morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thought perhaps Clarence was over here . I have a certificate for him . How 's tricks , Lester ? " His blue eyes , twinkling a little , turned back on Henry Harris . " You do n't look too well , Henry . Heart ever bother you ? Palpitations ? " He put out his hand , closed it over Henry Harris ' wrist , his finger tips shutting down on the radial artery while he felt for his watch . Henry Harris jerked his hand away ; the corners of his mouth grew firm ; he began to smile . " You move pretty quiet for a man your size , George . Is it hard ? " " Professional training , Henry . We try not to go banging around a sick room . Come in some time and I 'll look you over . You 're not as young as you were , you know . Little things like a knock on the door should n't shake you up . " " I 'll probably live . " " Sure , you will . But a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do all the things we used to do , Henry . " " Maybe not . Seems like I 'm getting a little deaf , sometimes . "  | " Often happens . It has n't affected me yet ; but I always did have pretty keen hearing . Well , I 'll have to see if I can get hold of Clarence . So long . " They could hear his heavy steps in the hall and the brisk thud of his descent on the stairs . + The rain continued . All the sky to be seen was the blanket of vapor ceaselessly condensing , in gradual movement just touching the hill tops . Up to meet it a universal mist went off the earth , now colder from its remnants of melting snow than the air . In the little depression at the southeast corner of the New Winton green , a pool widened out . Roads merely gravel surfaced , like those at the ends of the green , and the one bisecting it from Bates ' store east to the station , were softening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The broad surface of US6W held here and there flat thin sheets of water . Presenting a mechanical twitch of windshield wipers , motors moving on it came through fairly fast , raising clouds of spray . Down across fields to the west , clear now of snow , hung with haze , the river ice lay sunk pallid under a half foot of water . At eleven o'clock the up-train got in ; great locomotive gleaming wet , steam merging in the mist , all the cars dripping dirty water , windows clouded over , jeweled with drops . Out fell the mail sacks . In the lighted express car , men , keeping as dry as they could , shoved crates and bundles onto the handtrucks . Forward , the engineer , gog-  | glen in a band across his eyes , shoulder and left arm covered by a black rubber coat , had his head out , high in the cab , watching for the conductor 's signals . Now the locomotive made a stupendous first effort , wheels slipping on the wet steel , steam hammering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the cars began to slide by . Through the mist , back gleamed the lighted scarlet markers . The mail cart , covered with a tarpaulin , was trundled over to the post office . People had already begun to gather , and most of them had noticed , on the big thermometer outside the door , that the tinted alcohol had climbed the capillary bore , crossing fifty . Men , too warm in heavy coats , women , closing umbrellas as they approached Bates ' counters , expressed themselves : " Why , it 's like spring ? " " Up to Truro , the snow 's all gone . Not that there 's much here ? " " Would n't surprise me if the river went tonight ? " In mud-coated knee boots , an olive slicker and a sodden felt hat , Mr. Snyder , from the construction camp , was talking to Mr. Bates . He wanted to get a tractor . One of the Interstate Light &; Power trucks was stuck in the mess of water and deepening mud of the Cobble road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , for there was no way of getting past the obstruction . In Mr. Bates ' melancholy opinion , most tractors would be laid up still . Perhaps Weems ' wrecking car could make it . George Weems , consulted , thought that it might be possible . " Harry 's pretty handy about that kind of thing , "  | he admitted , " but if you 're really stuck on the Cobble road in a thaw like this ? " Faced with this amiable but slightly derisive patronage , Snyder felt bound to explain that the situation was not so dumb as it seemed . He 'd seen long ago that the road would be impassable for him in the spring . His plan had been to get all the trucks out of the old barn at the foot of the hill which Mr. Harris had rented them for a garage , and bring them in town at the first sign of a thaw . Who could have foreseen anything like this yesterday ? Snyder had troubles enough and he was close to unloading them on New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding now , had been built with some regard for snow and cold , but not , apparently , for any such downpour as this . The main bunk house leaked in several places . The site drained all right , but the knoll on which the temporary buildings had been put up , denuded , showed a tendency to erode deeply on all sides . This happened to be important because the latrine shed had been placed at the edge of a particularly precipitous slope into a gully behind . The steady rainwash was already undermining its slight foundations . Oddly enough , this appeared to cheer men who had nothing to do but regard the wet valley . It offered opportunity for ribaldries about themselves tumbling ( the most comic situation many of them could imagine ) in a heap with their collected excrement , to be washed away together . Snyder was ready to say that this was the last winter construction job he 'd ever have anything to do with . He doubted if time saved half way compensated for the annoyances and expenses . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an office in his life thought up ; and he , Snyder , was the goat .  | Harry Weems appeared then in a yellow slicker . He had been somewhat relieved to discover that Snyder was there for help , not to raise a row about any whiskey which Harry might have sold his men . Sure , Harry said , they could try . He got a set of claw chains , laid them down on the garage floor , and ran the wrecking truck on them ; struggled , with Snyder 's assistance , to hook them up . At the door , a horn rang out strident . Guy Banning 's car poked its long hood in , crawled neatly past the truck and halted . " Listen , Guy , " said Harry , " leave it here , will you ? I got to go out for about an hour . We can tackle it after lunch . " " All right . About half-past two ? " " Sure . " Guy Banning fastened the flap and collar of a trench coat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " asked Snyder . " Do n't seem to have seen him before . " " He 's down at Yale . Son of the Bannings  --  in the big place up the end of the green . He 's got a sister you 've probably seen . Nice-looking kid with a sort of thin face . Drives a Ford coupe around . " " With a red-headed girl ? " " That 's right . Mr. Hoyt 's daughter . " " Used to see them on the Cobble road . Let 's go . " Driving in the rain , Harry Weems said : " Wet on the hill ? " " Wet enough . Listen , do you know the ground up there ? " " I guess so . "  | " Well , listen , where does that little brook right behind us come out ? " " Damned if I know . Probably down at Bull 's pond . Why ? " " Well , I wondered . Afraid we might be polluting it . You never know in the country who uses what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brooks around here . " 2 ALTHOUGH the rain had lasted all day Sunday , and looked as if it might last forever , Monday morning was beautifully clear and warm . Virginia Banning , awakening , could feel the changed air on her face  --  soft , mild and fresh . Lying still , she could see the sunlight on the sodden limbs and ruddy twigs of the maples , and behind them , brilliantly blue . At the head of the flag pole by the tennis court , a flag which must be new lifted out , straightening exquisitely sharp and clean stripes ; a ripple of vivid red ; a swelling and swaying of the blue field with immaculate stars . Larry had apparently decided to consider today Washington 's birthday ; apparently , too , he was pleased with the world . She could hear the scratch of a rake on a path , and Larry whistling with a clear and sweet skill : Sometimes I 'm happy The danger of dying if she could not go to Paris was suddenly remote ; and this irritated her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even allow her a quality as solid as prolonged disappointment .  | She just felt tranquil . Down by the stables , Samson barked , one mild , friendly boom . She would , she decided , get Guy to take her driving . Throwing off the covers , she sat a moment on the edge of the bed , looking at the bright flag and the marvelous sky . She stood up then ; walked barefoot to the bathroom door , and hit the back of her hand against it . Getting no response , she opened it . The door beyond was open too and she could see the sunlight on the floor of Guy 's room . He was knotting a necktie in front of the mirror , and he half turned . " Listen , " he said , " you ca n't get a bath . " " Has that damn electric heater broken down again ? " " No , but wait till you see the water . It 's mostly mud . " She turned on a faucet . " It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black a minute ago . " " Well , it 's not now . " " Let it run a minute and see . " " I am . It 's getting better . Take me out in your car this morning , will you ? " " What for ? " " Do n't , then . " " Where do you want to go ? " " I do n't want to go anywhere . Ca n't you just drive ? " " I suppose so . " " Well , will you ? " " Maybe . But I 'll tell you right now I 'm not going to let you drive . You did something to the steering gear when you swiped it Friday . " " Could n't I even drive it with you there ? " " No . " " Gosh , you 're a hog , Guy ! " She closed the door , shot  | the bolt on it , and pulled her pajamas off . He came close to the door and said something , obviously annoyed ; but she turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to take her just in order not to let her drive . Mrs. Banning was glad that it was clear . Leroy Getchell , the Principal of the New Winton school , assisted by Miss Kiernan , who taught the fifth grade , had been working for over three weeks on Washington 's Vision , a Patriotic Pageant . Some of the more essential costumes had been rented from a New York firm . Those less essential had been made at home . Into learning lines and rehearsals a good deal of time and effort had gone . Mr. Ingraham , who conducted manual training classes in the basement , had built the set to go on the platform in the assembly hall . Lester Dunn had been persuaded to do the wiring for only what the materials cost him . If it had continued to rain , both attendance and enthusiasm would have suffered . Beyond underwriting , as she always did , most of the actual costs , Mrs. Banning had n't really done much about it herself ; but she liked things , over which a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Getchell was her strongest ally on the School Committee . Since he was very energetic about such entertainments , she would do everything she could , in loyal exchange for his help in dealing with Henry Harris and his deadlocking combination with Mr. Lane and Mr. Ordway  --  the one because of a sour and obtuse miserliness ; the other because of his liking for his  | position as representative at Hartford and willingness to arrange any sort of minor deal or compromise with the Democrats to keep it safe . Thus , there might always be three against her . Miss Kimball , the Librarian , could be counted on to do as Mrs. Banning wanted . Mr. Getchell , as Chairman , had two votes ; but Henry Harris had cleverly  --  that was in the guise of being cautious with public money  --  forced into the rules of procedure a requirement that all financial matters should be approved by at least a two-thirds vote . This completely counteracted the Chairman 's advantage , since there were seven votes , and four would never be quite two thirds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , or could be so presented as to seem , a matter of finances ; so progress , except in directions approved by Henry Harris , was uncertain . Henry Harris was not interested in entertainments ? presumably because there was nothing for him in them . If they had entertainments , it would be on the trifling funds of the Parent-Teacher Association , with Mrs. Banning making up the deficits more or less anonymously . She could not , for instance , have the ice cream sent up from Sansbury charged to herself . That was patronage too direct , and would cause grumbling about what was good enough for the ladies of the association was good enough and so on . The proper procedure was to charge it to the association and inconspicuously contribute to the treasury a sum to cover it . A person less instinctively generous or less resolute in good works might have washed her hands of the whole affair long ago ; but Mrs. Banning felt that difficulties only emphasized duty . Deserting some one who tried as hard as Mr. Getchell to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creature like Miss Kimball ( her father was Ralph Kimball , the station agent , and a very plain person ndeed ; making her cultural triumphs the more impressive nd deserving of support ) unencouraged , was just as imossible as failing to support Doctor Wyck 's zeal in schoolng the scanty , once carelessly low church congregation of t . Matthias 's in what he called Catholic Practice . The entertainment was to take place at two o'clock . either Virginia nor Guy was going to be available . Guy ould n't be expected to go , and Virginia would probably have been so bored and rude to both parents and teachers that her absence might be just as well . She had gone driving with Guy , and telephoned from Litchfield that they would n't be back for luncheon . Mr. Banning had spent the morning considering his crocuses , likely to be open very shortly if weather like this continued ; and helping Larry saturate with boiling water a thoughtfully compounded mixture of loam and rotten leaf mold and sand in the dozen cold frames on the sunny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early planting , he voluntarily said that he would go . There were at least thirty cars down by the school house , and many people moving about . Mr. Ingraham , Scoutmaster as well as Manual Training Instructor , was running in and out in his uniform , which was a good deal too small for him . This , with the solemnity he showed in exchanging three-fingered salutes with little boys whose similar uniforms were somewhat too big , gave him a slightly idiotic air , but he was very cheerful and enthusiastic . His troop , of all heights and sizes , mostly needing haircuts and busy blowing their noses , looked , if not very military , highly pleased with their work of showing cars  | where to park and acting as ushers to their indulgent parents . It did seem as though every one were enjoying it , and Mrs. Banning got out of the car contentedly . She ever said good afternoon to Mr. Harris , who had put on a starched collar and smiled at her with warmest malevo lence , removing his hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined her at once , and so did Miss Kimball , Pete Andrews , who must have been sitting in something like tar and wore a thick mat of yellow hair well down his neck under his campaign hat , managed to find them four seats in a row facing the extemporized stage . Shortly before three o'clock the shades were all pulled down and the curtains dragged apart . Some one had forgotten to turn on the stage lights , but this was hastily remedied and the audience saw , surprised , an illuminated section of forest at the extreme right . Since most of the stage was still in darkness it might be supposed that something else had gone wrong , but , as no consternation arose behind scenes , it was agreeably accepted . Into the light came now Ronald Fell , a cocked hat on his head , clad in the hypothetical buff and blue of the Continental army . This was perhaps an anachronism , for where Washington , the Young Surveyor , could have got such a uniform was not clear ; but at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was immediately followed by the Vogel twins . Their faces had been stained brown and they were closely wrapped in Navajo blankets , indicating clearly that they were Indians . Having , for reasons presently to become apparent , got as far onto the stage as he could , Ronald stopped suddenly , causing the agitated Vogel twins to recoil . With exaggerated feeling , he stretched and yawned . He faced about  | then and said : " Twenty long and weary miles have we journeyed today , my brothers . Let us lie down here under the pines and sleep , for night has fallen . " Both twins assented to this proposal and they all disposed themselves on the floor , where Ronald fell asleep at once . The Vogel boys , squatting uncomfortably in their blankets , began , after a sibilant prompting from the wings , to explain that never had they seen a white man with the courage and strength of this Washington . Prompted again from the side , Jack Vogel blurted hastily : " But look , he seems to dream ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pause , pregnant with rustlings , whispered admonitions and obscure movements . Quite suddenly other lights came on , illuminating , behind a haze of stretched gauze to the left , what could be understood to be a dream or a vision . Ronald must have got up and gone around in back after it was dark . Somebody could be heard beating a drum in the background while somebody else made a good deal of noise walking up and down . This was explained by Bill Ordway , who , having given the stiffly staring Ronald a resume of the iniquities of George III , and described the Boston Tea Party and Paul Revere 's ride , then informed him that he was assuming command of the Continental Army . Ronald began an acknowledgment , but some one had miscalculated a little and the lights went out , so he stopped . An interval of muffled expostulations followed ; there was a great swishing and shuffling and the lights came on again disclosing Molly Ordway and Jane Ely with caps and aprons on , apparently sitting on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costume , watched them approvingly . The audience was haltingly  | informed that Mistress Betsy Ross was engaged in sewing an American flag . There was a succeeding , somewhat longer , delay , afterwards proving to have been due to the introduction of a painted back-drop representing a snowy forest . In the foreground Ronald was kneeling on one knee looking intently at the ceiling , while two shabby soldiers , readily identified as the Lane boys , observed that the General was asking God 's help and things were pretty bad at Valley Forge . After that , Lord Cornwallis ( Joe Quimby ) was disclosed in a fine scarlet uniform eagerly presenting Ronald with his sword when he learned that the war was over . Bill Ordway next appeared , administering the presidential oath to Ronald . He was followed by Molly Ordway , clothed now in a costume representing Columbia , saying with the greatest composure a piece of poetry about Washington 's undying fame and the republic going forward . Somebody called audibly from behind , " That 's all . That 's the end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the vision part of the stage and bowed their acknowledgments . Mr. Ingraham hissed something , and his boy scouts ran and pulled up the shades . The audience faced about on its chairs and discussed admiringly the dramatic skill displayed by all members of the cast . In the coat room ice cream was being dished out . Agreeing that all the children did very well , pleased by the simple and innocently festive air  --  Mr. Getchell 's wide smile , Miss Kiernan , pink with modest triumph , saying to Miss Kimball : " Oh , there you are ! How did it go ? " ? Mrs. Banning glanced at the coat room door just in time  | to see Doctor Bull lumbering out , a plate raised on his big hand . With gross , jovial relish he was scooping up heaped spoonfuls of ice cream . Though Doctor Bull had , certainly , as good a right to refreshments as any one else , it seemed to Mrs. Banning outrageous that poor Mamie Talbot , dead through his incompetence and neglect , was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care in the world nor visible weight on his conscience , gobbling ice cream . She looked at him with chill , reproving distaste , while he put the empty plate on the seat of a chair , wiped his mouth , and seemed to consider for a moment , joining the herd of children getting drinks of water out of the porcelain fountain . Mr. Getchell came by then and all the way across the room Mrs. Banning could hear Doctor Bull booming : " Good show , Getchell . You ought to send Molly Ordway down to the Follies . " " Thanks for lunch , " Virginia said . " I 'll pay you back . " " Forget it , " Guy nodded . " Where do you want to go ? " " Not home . We do n't have to go home , do we ? " " Well , I do n't want to drive all over the map . I have to get back to New Haven tonight , anyway . " The car was parked last in a line , almost in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built from the same plans first used in New Winton , here in Litchfield greater skill or more liberal funds had been available . The four white pillars of the porch were a lofty , elaborated Corinthian , high enough for serenity which was lost in  | mere squat quaintness at New Winton . Perfectly restored , painstakingly cared for , it stood to best advantage , half against the north valley , at the fall-away of the Torrington road . Virginia looked at the sunlight slanting on it with distracted pleasure . " We could swing around Torrington and Winsted to Canaan and come down US7 , " Guy said generously . He sank into his racoon skins . " I 'll bet you 're cold . You ought to have worn your fur coat . This is n't spring . " " Why , it 's hot , Guy ! I 'm not cold . I 'm not a bit cold . " " Anyway , that 's the lousiest-looking thing ? " He indicated the leather jacket . " You ought to throw it away . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flushing a little . " I do n't care how I look . What difference does it make around here ? " She turned her blue eyes on his desperately . " Guy , could n't I ? " " Listen , I said I would n't let you drive . If you 're going to make a fuss , we 'll go home . " " All right , " she sighed . At Canaan , when it was at least as far back one way as the other and Guy had stopped for gasoline , she risked it again . " Guy , " she besought him , " just a little , please ? " " Lord ! " he groaned . " I suppose you wo n't be happy till you kill yourself . All right . " Headed south , she drove with zeal reluctantly curbed while Guy watched her as though she were going to meet head-on every approaching car or , if that failed , smash into the next telegraph pole . Through the wide fields beyond the South Canaan church , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the hills , there was no wind and the sun was warm , glittering off the shallow , ice-free river . She was doing a carefully gained fifty  | miles an hour when they passed West Cornwall , but Guy did not protest . From the high viaduct and great white arch lifting US7 across the river , they could look down on the railroad tracks , the roof of the station , the bare tree tops and shingled back of the original small covered Cornwall bridge far underneath . Virginia , reassured now , sat at alert , unstrained ease , her gloved hands over the lower spokes of the big wheel . She was attuned to the car , as a practiced rider may be to a horse . Knowing nothing of a time when there were no motors , unable to remember when those there were could not be wholly loved and trusted , she shared Guy 's special sympathetic feeling for fine machinery . Such cruelties as improper , lubrication or careless adjustment would move her with almost the same compunction as the wanton ill treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this right attitude , and by Virginia 's resulting competence , to be seen well enough through her calm heavenly pleasure , not in going anywhere nor in the hills and the river valley , but in the perfect performance of a motor as fine as could possibly be built , Guy said : " As a matter of fact , you drive pretty well for a girl . Some women do drive all right if they can keep their minds on it and nothing happens they do n't expect ? " " Just a little longer , Guy ? " They swept down under the great bare maples in long alignment through Kent . Virginia crossed the railroad tracks faster than she should have , but after all , somewhat slower than Guy would have crossed them , so he did n't point it out to her . Reaching New Milford , sprawled on the eastern slope in unpicturesque array across the river ,  | he said : " Cut over here and back through Southbury . It 's getting late . " Indifferent , or moved to pity by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not suggest that he drive . Silent , he occupied himself with a pipe which he did not like , but which happened to be a fad among his friends , a revolt against the cigarettes so incessantly smoked by people they did not care to know . He was occupied , too , with the crowded world of his college : how much tutoring he was going to have to invest in to get through his Economics ; how much whiskey he had better provide for Friday night ; whether he could spare a chapel cut to go to a Friday night ( the next Friday ) dance in New York , and whether , if he could , he could afford to stay the weekend ; and if he could afford it , whether Marjorie Pitkin were worth the trouble and expense . Or would he do better to call up the DeFoe girl ? He had almost decided , along with several punctilious friends , to drop her , after her tipsy behavior caused almost a scandal at the Junior Prom . However , being seen with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her in New Haven and she would probably let him sleep with her . He was surprised to find them into New Winton , with the twilight over the green . Virginia relaxed , slumping as though at last tired , at the wheel . " Thanks a lot , " she startled him by saying , " I 've had a swell time , Guy . " She looked at him , a little tremulous ; and so , rather ridiculously , resolved his last difficulty ; for he did not care to think of his sister , whose purity or innocence he did n't exaggerate , but who none the less had it in the senses he considered important , in connection with the shamefully attractive and obscenely available DeFoe girl  --  after all  | nothing but a slut of good family . Righteousness thus triumphed , probably definitely ; and he resolved to call up Marjorie as soon as he got back to New Haven . Virginia , unconscious of her service to him , wheeled precisely through the gate . Another car was standing on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoyts ' , " she said . " They must have been down to that lousy play . " Behind the cedars and the chestnut sapling fence , she stopped the car . The dogs , muzzles down , had been bolting their suppers ; and though they both turned , barking and wagging their tails , they did not trust each other enough to leave their separate feeding pans . Larry , smoking a cigarette , perched on the doorstep of his stable quarters . He waved a hand . Virginia sat still a moment while Guy got out . A white moon , approaching the first quarter , hung half a foot above the long summit of the western hill , and she sighed again , aware of the wonderful stillness of the mild air and the calm vacancy of the impending clear night . She breathed deep then , trying to get together the remnants of a day almost entirely happy to protect herself . Larry had got up and come over negligently . " Val Hoyt 's inside with her father looking for you , Virginia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you were around the stables . Told me she was going away some place . " " I know , " said Virginia , her tone flattening . " She 's going to Paris . " " Nope , " said Larry with calm positiveness . " They had some changed plans . Somewhere west . With her father . Somewhere in New Mexico . They were going to be gone  | two months and they were fixing it up for you to go with them . " Virginia snapped open the car door . " Larry ! " she gasped , " they have n't left , have they ? " " Car 's still there . But I guess you better hurry . Val said she thought your father was going to let you , if you wanted ? " She started away , running toward the house ; and this was too much for the dogs . They left what they had n't eaten , eagerly overtaking her , bounding and barking . " Just look at her ! " invited Larry , shaking his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess . She 's sure funny when she gets excited . " Guy automatically gave him one of the freezing blank stares used effectively to annihilate impertinent inferiors at college . Here , it passed harmless over Larry 's thickskinned amiability . " Going to go down to college tonight , Guy ? " he asked . " I am . " " Might as well leave your car out , then . Not much chance of freezing tonight , I guess . Yeah , the Hoyts want to drive down there . He 's got a ranch there , or something , has n't he ? I always heard ? " " If you have n't anything else to do , " said Guy , " get a rag and wipe this off , will you ? " + " Thou turnest man to destruction : again thou sayest , Come again , ye children of men . For a thousand years in  | thy sight ? " Doctor Wyck naturally knew it by heart . Against the fresh lawn of his surplice , the rector held in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a black leather bound book , but that was purely formal . Every word out of his mouth had the perfection of familiarity and practice . To Virginia , disinterested , his voice differed not at all from the clean even print in the prayer book  --  an unnecessarily exquisite one given her on the occasion of her confirmation  --  which she held idly open . Doctor Wyck even supplied the punctuation . Here , in a psalm , he held over on the caesural colon . His voice surged , paused drily , returned , like a calm sea on a beach : ? thy wrathful indignation  --  the light of thy countenance ? the days of our age  --  apply our hearts unto wisdom To bury Mamie to such a strain really seemed absurd . Virginia , in the prodding pleasure of her own constantly recalled happiness , noticed it at once , with the solemn pronouncement of the preliminary sentences . It was part of her feeling so acutely and joyfully stimulated . Everything had an edge and an interest ; every detail was cause enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was gave her pleasure . Who could imagine Mamie doing anything so resolute as , though she were dead , yet living ? Where on earth would she get the nerve to see God for herself , her eyes beholding , and not another ? Mamie , stretched out , shut up in the shrouded coffin , would probably think that they were making fun of her . As it is to the wise , a word to the weak is sufficient . Unless you were proud , strong , well up in life , you had no need to be reminded at such length that you were nothing and went down like grass . Who could doubt it ? Doctor Wyck had launched now on the long , resound- '  | ing muddle following I Corinthians xv . Virginia , looking at it in print , felt invulnerable even to that awful boredom . She did not want to think about Santa Fe too much , for she had learned that anything thought about eagerly would be bound to disappoint her ; but she could at least think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any rotten school . Even that might be risky , however , so she turned back , began to read at random : Here is to be noted that the office ensuing is not to be used for any unbaptized adults , any who die excommunicate , or who have laid violent hands upon themselves . She thought : " If I killed myself , would Doctor Wyck make a fuss about having a nice service for me ? I 'll bet he would n't . " Exhilarated by her own cynicism regarding Doctor Wyck 's attitude , she let her eyes slide away to the atrocious colored glass of the window at the beginning of the nave . It commemorated her great-great-grandparents , who , in 1823 , had been largely responsible for erecting the church . A plump , vacant-faced Gabriel seemed to be fanning the Blessed Virgin with an object perhaps visible to the eye of faith as a lily . The Virgin Herself sat absorbed in a patch of dirt with two stones and thirteen ? such were the desperate resources of long ago Sunday mornings  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mantle , Virginia noted now , was of precisely the blue used for medicine bottles whose contents may be injured by natural light . The next window  --  Virginia felt strong enough to bear the boredom of a quick look at it  --  showed the ox-eyed , curly-bearded apostles giving forth the lots which fell upon Matthias . It stood to the Glory of God and in loving  | Memory of Paul Banning , twenty-one years Senior Warden of this Church ; and of Mathilda , his wife . Virginia had an early , uncertain memory of Mathilda , his wife  --  by that time , his relict ; a small sedentary figure with a black shawl and a distinctive odor , much like a linen closet , which she associated with the phrase ? " a very old lady . " By the third window , Doctor Hall , a former rector , was remembered ; but that , Virginia felt , she could not look at . To mix with the pleasures of impending departure , the colored glass brought back the old ache of time slowing to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrist , half hidden by her glove , seemed for a dreadful moment to be measuring again the world without end minutes of a child 's Sunday morning . Made up of them , the mere hour of a service could seem worship as everlasting as the awful reiteration of the six-winged beasts , the repetitious fallingdown of the four and twenty elders . Doctor Wyck 's voice reached her ears , proceeding urgently : " Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual , but that which is natural ; and afterwards that which is spiritual ? " Virginia shook herself a little , pronouncing : " I am going away from this damn hole . I am going to Santa Fe a week from Monday . It does n't matter because whatever happens I 'm going away a week from Monday . " This was a success , but she felt , almost as bad as boredom , the insupportable compulsion of her desire , the impatience for what would be then to be now , forthwith . Her throat constricted in the agony of having it put off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her veins were cloyed with lukewarm blood ; her very bones itched  | through her flesh and she found herself actually praying : God , make it a week from Monday Howard Upjohn was uncomfortably clad in the clothes he reserved for funerals , complete to dreadful black gloves covering his prominently large hands . When he was younger he had kept also a silk hat . Whether time had finally ruined it , or Howard had simply decided that its shape made him look too much like the symbolic figure of Prohibition in hostile cartoons , he had some time changed to a derby . This he felt for on the pew seat beside him now . Inconspicuously turning , he worked along until he could step into the side aisle and go briskly back , motioning up his four pall-bearers . To each he presented a pair of dark gray gloves , and waited while they put them on . Apparently the church part of it was over . May Tupping , not quite certain what was to happen next , wished that she knew the time . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little late relieving her ; but she did n't want to be . The Divisional Superintendent was supposed to be coming through today . If he happened to come before she got there , he would do nothing about it , but he would naturally notice that she was n't very punctual . She turned her head a little to see the pall-bearers , who , after several tries , had got stiffly into step , tramping down the aisle . Harry Weems had on a good and expensive blue serge suit . He was paired with Lester Dunn , whose suit , though cut with remarkable jauntiness , was appropriately dark , too . Eric Cadbury , who must have been picked up  | and pressed into service by Howard directly before the ceremony began , was dressed with much less elegance , but being older than any of the others he could contribute a certain gravity ; The fourth man was Ed Darrow , son of Mrs. Talbot 's sister-in-law at Banning 's Bridge . Doubtless he only had one good suit , and it happened to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guessed that it was the cause for his face getting redder and redder as he came down . Mrs. Darrow , sitting on the other side of Mrs. Talbot , looked at Ed with a trusting approval , however ; at least , until Howard had got the wheeled conveyance into motion , and the bearers fell in behind , to escort the coffin with its low heap of flowers  --  all rather shoddy except the sheaf of lilies which had come up from Waterbury , professionally packed and expedited , with the Bannings ' card ? uncertainly toward the door . Mrs. Darrow then began to weep and lament with annoying facility , causing Mrs. Talbot , heretofore contented with occasional sniffs , to break out , too . May got them both to their feet and into the aisle with the handful of the congregation . From the far side , Mrs. Banning said quietly , " May , " and May stopped . " Larry has the car outside , " Mrs. Banning whispered . " You take Mrs. Talbot and Mrs. Darrow down to the cemetery in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They came into the warm sunlight on the steps of the church . Doctor Wyck , who had gone to the sacristy for a cloak and biretta , was waiting for them . Howard and his assistants had just eased the flower-topped coffin into the half-ton truck which served him now that he no longer kept horses , and business did not warrant buying a motor  | hearse . Mat Small was driving the truck . He was in working clothes , for he had spent the morning with Albert Foster digging the grave and would afterwards fill it in . May said to Mrs. Talbot : " Mrs. Banning has been kind enough to offer us her car to go down in ? " Larry Ward , sitting bored at the wheel , in a cap and old chauffeur 's uniform , got out reluctantly , waving rather than helping them in . From the clock on the dashboard May could see that it was quarter to twelve ; and , glancing across the green to the telephone office , she was dismayed to find that the coupe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors was already parked there . The superintendent would undoubtedly wait until twelve and observe her tardiness . The others had formed a straggling group following Doctor Wyck around the stone side of the church to walk the few hundred yards . Harry Weems and Lester brought up the rear , with Doctor Bull , whose presence had been severely ignored by every one else . There would be no satisfying people on that point , May recognized . If he had n't come , there would have been a general outraged criticism of his callousness . When he did come , the criticism was to the effect that one wondered how he had the face , considering that he 'd done everything he could to kill Mamie . Doctor Bull , however , did n't need her sympathy . Standing well above , and twice as big as , Lester or Harry , he moved with an assurance which was almost blithe . He blinked cheerfully in the warm sunlight ; he stared with obvious robust contempt now at Doctor Wyck 's wind-stirred vestments and the biretta , now at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banning 's erect  | shoulders , concealing her neck , piling high as the lower edge of her neat black hat . By the cemetery gate , surmounted by a curved iron scroll and small cross , Larry ran the car off the road . May helped Mrs. Talbot and Mrs. Darrow out . The others , waiting for them , let them now lead , following Doctor Wyck and the coffin down the path past the weighty granite and marble monuments , the substantial blocks  --  Coulthard , Cardmaker , Allen , Bull , Banning  --  dominating railed plots , most of them already thick with small markers . Among lesser stones , and graves planted with the iron star of the G.A.R. holding a stick and faded tatter of cheap flag left from last Memorial Day , a grave had been dug for Mamie . The turned-up earth was elaborately covered by mats of coarse , bright green imitation grass . Stretched across the pit were the bands of the device for lowering ; and laboriously the coffin was placed upon them , the flowers removed and laid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shovel . They were all gathered together now , forming a semicircle  --  Doctor Bull on one end , the Bannings on the other . Mrs. Talbot and Mrs. Darrow had quieted again . Doctor Wyck 's distinct voice was the only sound while they stood , no one looking at any one else , until Howard startled them all by making a motion to Albert Foster . Albert drove his spade into a heap of dry gravel , plainly brought there for the purpose , since the excavated earth was dark and damp . Shaking off any that was loose , he advanced clumsily , proffering the shovelful . Doctor Wyck took a little , hardly stopping his recitation except for the measure of emphasis . Fastidiously , he dropped it , in lieu of dust or ashes , on the coffin .  | May , her attention thus attracted , saw Mrs. Banning moisten her lips . One hand against the fox fur on her breast , she had found a small handkerchief with the other . She brought it inconspicuously first to her mouth , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia 's arm was through hers and she held it a moment . Suddenly close to tears herself , May thought ; she 's just imagining if it were Virginia there instead of Mamie . Mr. Banning , composed and serious , slipped a hand under her other arm . Doctor Wyck was reading : " Come , ye blessed children of my Father , receive the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world ? " May looked sadly at Albert with his spade , aware of the possible horrid irony in the words , thinking how unlikely it was that anything remained for Mamie except the earth Albert was waiting to shovel back . Now that she was right up against it , Mrs. Banning could probably feel that , too ; and May looked back to see her still holding Virginia 's arm , her face still averted and the small handkerchief tight in her gloved fingers . + From big wooden drums deposited along the transmission line , wiring crews were drawing sixty-one-strand aluminum steel core wire over the great spans . Six conductors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard wires ; now joined the delicately shaped , strong towers with an airy warp of metal more delicate still . New and untarnished , these spun filaments hung  | hardly more substantial than so many threads of light , dipping from tower to tower across the valley , mounting the hill in fine shining lines . On the high cross girders men worked hatless , in their shirts . The fields under them were growing green ; there were already a few dandelions . Monday and Tuesday , it was agreed that this could not last ; every one who saw Mamie buried commented on it and said so . Wednesday and Thursday , most people said that they had never seen anything like it . By Friday , this spring in the midst of winter became as natural as life in the midst of death . Sunday would be the first day of March ; and once it was March , a mere change of name could change what was wrong and amazing for February into what was right for spring . The light , the length of day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lasted , Saturday , eleven hours and nine minutes ; so any one could see that it was spring . Snowdrops were open everywhere , and Sunday Mr. Banning found two of his purple crocuses out . Behind the stables , the leafless forsythia was about to break in sprays of yellow blossoms . There were buds on the wild goose plums ; in a few more days there would obviously be blossoms . 3 AT EIGHT o'clock Tuesday morning , Doctor Bull , sitting in the old swivel chair at his office desk , grunted as he bent in the long process of lacing up a pair of hob-nailed knee boots . His shabby old bag stood open on a heap of not read copies of the Journal of the American Medical  | Association . Next to it he had laid out a couple of patent rubber ligatures , a cased scalpel , a hypodermic syringe , a pint bottle of whiskey and a bottle containing a chloride of lime solution . Finished with his boots , he checked these articles over and added them to the contents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear dead days beyond recall ? " he pawed through the closet in the corner until he was able to produce a roughly finished oak bludgeon and a forked stick . Taking a fold of his jacket , he wiped the dust off them , laid them beside a pair of worn leather gauntlets . The telephone rang then and he could hear Susie shuffling to answer it . " Hell ! " he remarked , stopping his singing , for Harry Weems and Lester were due any minute and he wanted to get up to North Truro fairly early . Susie shrieked : " Doctor Bull , Mrs. Kimball says Ralph is sick ; could you come right away . " " Tell her to wait a moment , " he said , shutting up the bag . He went into the hall and took the receiver from her . " Hello , " he said . " What 's wrong with Ralph ? Oh . Take his temperature ? Well , how do you know he 's feverish ? Oh , he says so , does he ? Give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . If I get back from North Truro early , I 'll look in . " He started to hang up , but Doris Clark 's voice interrupted : " Oh , Doctor Bull , I have another call for you . " " Who is it ? " " Mr. Ordway . " " Well , all right ? " His eyes swung around to find Susie listening anxiously . " Beat it ! " he roared . " Oh , hello . What 's the trouble ? " " Well , I 'll stop in a minute and look at her , " he agreed .  | " I 'm trying to get off to North Truro . No , I thought I 'd take Lester and Harry and try to clean out some of the snakes up on the ridge . Been so warm a lot of them may be out ? " He heard the front door bell and added , " Guess they 're here now ; but they can wait a minute . I 'll be over . Come in , come in ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood on the steps and he said , " You 'll have to wait a while . Molly Ordway 's had to get sick . Be right along . " Harry had his car at the end of the path . " Might as well get my things in now , " Doctor Bull observed , turning back to his office . Out in the hall again with them , he called , " All right , Aunt Myra . I 'm leaving . " Mrs. Cole appeared at the door of the kitchen . " Good morning , " she said sharply to Lester and Harry . " George , you 'd better let those snakes alone . They are n't hurting anybody way up there . You 'll probably get yourself bitten . " " They are n't hardly awake yet , Mrs. Cole , " Lester said . " This warm spell sort of fools them and they start coming out ; but they 'll be so stiff they ca n't hardly move . " " Got to do my duty , Aunt Myra , " said George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't protect the community . " " You 'd protect it better if you stayed home and tended to your business . You 're too old a man to go climbing around cliffs killing harmless creatures . " " These are rattlesnakes , Aunt Myra ; we are n't hunting rabbits today . " " Well , I expect they would n't harm any one who let them be ; and if you 're going to be late for dinner , you call me up . "  | " We 'll be all right , Mrs. Cole , " Harry Weems promised . " Wait for you in the car , Doc . " They had been waiting ten minutes when he came out the Ordways ' door and across the lawn . He got into the car and Lester said : " What 's wrong with Molly ? " " Oh , they used to call it spring fever ? " He began to fill a pipe while Harry backed the car around . " Everybody 's kind of run down in March . I 'll bet half her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . I gave her a dose of castor oil so she 'd have something to do at home . " " She 's getting to be a good-looking kid , " said Lester . " How old 's she ? " " Sixteen , I guess , " answered Harry Weems . " Same age , about , as Gerry Bates and Virginia Banning . Looks like they were turning out all girls that year . Matter of fact , Charlotte Slade , too . " " I hear she can be had . " " Maybe so . She looks sort of warm . " " Somebody saw her with Larry Ward parked outside that dance at the Odd Fellows Hall in Sansbury . Had her skirt around her neck . " " Yeah , that somebody would be Grant Williams . He gets more peeking done than any six ; and what he does n't see he can always say he did . " " I hear Virginia Banning 's going to New Mexico with the Hoyts . " " That 's right . They 're leaving a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some kid . I could use her . " " Well , I doubt if you ever will , " said Harry Weems , " so do n't go brooding about it . Bad for his health , is n't it , Doc ? " " It is . You 'd better keep your pants buttoned , Lester .  | I 'm telling you . You fool around much now and you 'll get yourself into trouble . " " I 'm listening , Doc . " " You better listen unless you want to be back for another party with me every afternoon . By the way , how 's my old friend Henry Harris these days . He seems to be lying pretty low . " " Oh , he 's around , " said Lester . " Who 's going to get done now ? " " It must be a secret , " said Lester mildly , " he is n't telling . " At North Truro they turned at the fork where a big sign showed a cowboy on a horse pointing to Robert Newell 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , up the muddy hill road in the warm second-growth woods . Through dense spots of hemlock and pine , the gray rock jutted out  --  short , sharp cliffs , towering split sections , a jumble of great glacial bowlders . " There we are , " observed Harry Weems . " We can get up this end of the ledges easiest . We 'll just pull the car into the brush here and go up that side . " He jerked on the brake and turned off the motor . George Bull opened his bag , took out the scalpel and syringe cases , the ligatures , and , testing the cork with his thumb , the bottle of chloride of lime , distributing them in his pockets . " That good whiskey , Doc ? " asked Lester . " We 'll see when we get back , " he promised . " Got a sack ? " " May be one on the floor there , " said Harry . " We 'll try to get a couple alive . Bates would like them in a box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | " If they are n't out after a nice week like last week , they 're dead already . " Up on the ledges , above the tree tops , the rock was warm in the sun . George Bull , blowing a little , wiped his forehead , glancing down over the wooded slopes to fields in the valley bottom . There was a tone of pale , fresh green over willows along the creek . Cows stood bunched by the fences . Behind the Clark house somebody was hanging out laundry . Harry Weems had been studying the broken stone shelves , damp shades of moss , blotches of lichen , and the low huckleberry bushes growing from drifts of old leaves and open chestnut burrs . " Listen , " he said , " I think the best thing would be for me to get up there and Lester up above and we 'll all work along together . Then , if we go slow and look sharp we can cover quite a lot of space . Here 's your club , Lester . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let the others get there . The rock 's so warm they may be feeling pretty spry . " At the end of half an hour they had covered the whole southern face without success . " I saw a swell place for them , " said Lester . " I 'll bet they 've got so much sense they know it is n't spring . " " We 'll try the upper ones , " George Bull said , swinging the oak stick . " They 're around here somewhere . " " Wait a second , " said Harry , seizing his arm . " What 's that ? " " A rattle . Right over there . Hang on , Lester . Let 's see him first . " They stood together , looking . " Funny , " Harry said . " I bet I could walk right on him but I 'm damned if I can see him . "  | " I see him , " George Bull said . " Middle ledge . See the dark lichen ? Now , look right down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's moving . Holy Christmas , there 's another . " " I do n't see it . " " You better get glasses . " " Sure ! " agreed Lester . " There 's one , sliding down off the rock . See his head ? Come on , let 's go . " " Cut down there and come around from the other side , Lester , " Doctor Bull said . " You come up this side , Harry . I 'll go up above and jump on them . " " You 'll what ? " " Get going and I 'll show you . " They could see him clambering along the top ledge . When he paused , he took a handkerchief from one pocket and what proved to be a match from another . Striking the match , he set fire to the corner of the twisted cloth . " All right , " he roared suddenly , " come on in ! " He dropped the burning handkerchief down the side of the ledge . " Get that old black bastard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the overjutting stone began to frill with little flames from the handkerchief . " Come on , Harry ! We 've got them by the short hairs . They 'll never get home to mother now ! " Up a crevice , onto the stone at his feet came a pitted , fluke-shaped head , the adroit neck swinging . He stamped his hobnailed heel on it . " One down ! " he shouted . Lester was slashing the leaves with his cudgel . From the sunny face of the lower ledge a half dozen snakes were scattering , sliding away frantic , but too stiff and slow . A single courageous , or stupidly amazed , female had coiled , fire behind and enemies on all sides , tail tip twitching up , stub head  | couched . " Coming at you ! " roared Doctor Bull . He leaped from the ledge , both nailed boots and his better than two hundred pounds landing on her before she could move . The thick end of his oak bludgeon rang dull on the stone ; he struck again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crevice . Wheeling , he brought it down with all his force on a thick sliding coil under a huckleberry bush , producing a head , writhing back in anguish . He smashed it against the stone . " Whee ! " he shouted . " We 'll be coming round the mountain ? " " Doc ! " yelled Harry . Some instinct had already warned him ; he started to jump . Although the snake in the crevice was not coiled and had to pounce rather than strike , the head easily reached his hand holding the cudgel . Fantastically wide open , the small jaws swung , closing faster than sight on the side of his thumb . " Hell and damnation ! " George Bull roared , in what was both pain and anger . He dropped his stick . His violent left hand grasped the neck , dragging clear a thick , three foot body . The head was torn from its hold ; one fang pulled out of the worn leather of the glove ; from the groove of the other a drop or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll never see town ! " Regardless of his bitten thumb he caught the writhing body , twitched it belly up and snapped the spine backwards . " Rattle for you , Harry ! " He tossed it ten feet over toward him . " Go on , see if you can get a couple alive . " " Aw , never mind , " said Lester . " I 'll bet we killed ten . We 'll bring the rattles in . Did he get you bad ? " " No . Went through the glove . " He shook the glove off , regarding the dark puncture in the thick side of the thumb . " Damn neat job , though , " he said , shaking it . " He  | was full of juice . " He moved down the ledge . " No need to sit on another . " He pulled the scalpel case from his pocket . " Take that out for me , Harry . " Laying the thumb on the stone , his left hand a little awkward , he drove the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grunting , he crossed it remorsely with another line . Laying down the scalpel he fished out the chloride bottle and the syringe case . " Too bad I did n't know it was going to be for me , " he said cheerfully . " Might have got myself some of that serum . Can you figure it out , Harry ? " " This come off ? " " That 's it . Fill it up . Needles right there . See how they go ? " " Uh , huh . " Doctor Bull thrust the bloody thumb into his mouth , sucking it while he felt for the ligatures . " Here you are , Lester . Take the little one twice around the thumb . " He looked critically at his hand . " Daresay we do n't need another , but we might as well have it . Unbutton that cuff for me , will you . God damn it , it would have to be my right hand . Let 's have it , Harry . We 'll give it a couple of shots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Taste good ? " asked Lester . " I 've drunk better . All right , I can take care of the rest , thanks . See how many of those sons of bitches we got . Better stamp out that fire too . Think it 's still burning under the side . Bring along the rattles . " Down at the car , where Doctor Bull , unassisted , had managed to get a covering bandage around his thumb , Lester produced eight severed rattles . " There 's your  | friend , " he said , holding up a seven-ringed one . " I 'll bet he wishes he had n't been so smart . " " I 'll bet I wish he had n't , too . Got a corkscrew , Harry ? Two ounces of spiritus frumenti orally as a stimulant seems to be indicated . I 'll leave the rest of it to you . Funny thing , though . Back in Michigan fifty years ago everybody believed whiskey was the cure for snake bite . First thing to do was get pie-eyed . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything worse ; but the fact is everybody who did it recovered . Figure that one out . " " Here you are , Doc . How 're you going to measure two ounces ? " " Weigh it on my tongue . Here 's to science . " Mrs. Cole said : " What did you do to your hand , George ? " " Snake bit me . " " My goodness ! Did n't I know it ? You ca n't say I did n't warn you . " " That 's right . I ca n't . How about some lunch ? " " Are you in pain , George ? " " Well , naturally it hurts , if that 's what you mean . But I can eat all right if I ever get a chance . " " Lunch will be ready directly . Some people called up . Susie , who called the doctor ? " " Vogels did , " shrilled Susie . " And Mr. Fell . And Mrs. Kimball called again . " " Yes , there 's plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around and tend to people , George , and let those snakes alone . " " Sure , they all get the pip . What can I do about it ? " " I do n't feel very good , either , " announced Susie , appearing . " I ? " " Sure ; you 're getting a bad case of incipient dish-washing . I 'd prescribe a couple of whacks on the rump with a shingle . " " No , I ai n't . I felt awful sick this morning . I got a pain in my stomach . " " Well , we 've got plenty of castor oil . " He brought his bag into the office , but he had scarcely set it down when the telephone rang . Susie cried out : " Doctor Bull 's house . Why , yes , he 's here . Oh , yes , I 'll tell him ? " She came to the door , announcing with interest , " Mrs. Vogel says Jack is still awful sick . She says he 's got an awful fever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell her I 'm having lunch . I 'll see about it afterwards . " The car at the first gasoline pump in front of Weems ' garage couched low on its **26;176;TOOLONG wheelbase . It was sober enough black ; but rich and lustrous , with a general silver-like glitter of non-tarnishable metal . On each wide hub cap was embossed a V12 . Besides whatever intricate refinements of mechanism , it suggested unconcern about running expenses . Similarly , the model ? it was a convertible coupe  --  suggested driving for pleasure and when the owner chose , not struggling through all  | weathers , year in and year out . On the silver grill fronting the broad radiator was affixed a round enamel plaque bearing the crossed Aesculapian staffs of the county medical association . Incommoded by the difficulty of using his sore right hand , Doctor Bull halted his own cheap car at the other gasoline pump . " Some outfit , " he said to Mat Small , nodding at it . " I would n't mind getting me one of those . Only , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the afternoon sunlight and walked over . " Hello , Verney , " he said . " You certainly look prosperous . Lots of sickness in Sansbury ? " Doctor Verney had just finished paying George Weems . He turned in the deep ample seat , extending a hand . " Good afternoon , Doctor . No , as a matter of fact , everybody 's too damn healthy . " Laughing , to show that his deploring of such a situation was a pleasantry , his ever so slight ill-ease was apparent and George Bull grinned . " Snake bit me this morning , " he said , raising his right hand . " The snake died . " He continued to examine Verney , his blue eyes twinkling . " Who 's sick at the Ban-nings ' ? " " Virginia 's laid up . Nothing much . I would n't be surprised if it were just excitement . She 's going on a trip with the Hoyts . Or the weather . A chill . It 's not as warm as it looks , really . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one case of pneumonia as soon as it turns cold again . " " Yes , " agreed George Bull . " I lost a case a week or so ago . " Doctor Verney 's features  --  even ; rather handsome in a severe , alertly intelligent way  --  underwent a small , disconcerted change , showing that Mrs. Banning had told  | him all about it , or her version of it . " Well , " he said , " that 's the way it is . The winters are really pretty hard up here ? " He would be glad to get on , George Bull recognized , but his awareness of the fact that he had cut Doctor Bull out on what ought to be Doctor Bull 's best paying patients made him anxious not to add incivility to that injury . George Bull grinned again , enjoying Doctor Verney 's delicacy . " Yes , " he said , " the spring crop 's beginning to come in . I 've been running around dealing out castor oil for two days now . Regular epidemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't feel so good . Wish I could soak them twenty dollars a visit . That 's one of the greatest modern contributions to medical science . Just thinking about it cures half the people who wake up imagining they 're sick . Well , I 'll have to be getting on . Quite a car , this ? " He banged his left fist approvingly on the door top . " You ought to send a snapshot of it to the editor of the Journal . Stop all this belly-aching about starving country physicians . " He grinned again and waved his hand . Doctor Verney stepped on the starter , but for a minute nothing happened as he had forgotten to turn on the ignition . Absorbed in grinning at this slightly uneasy departure , George Bull realized that some one had come up casually and joined him . " Hello , Henry , " he nodded , half turning his head . " There 's the kind of car you want . Planning to get one next month ? " Henry Harris ' face warmed to his silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away ? " he asked . They stood watching it down past the end of the green in silence . " Why , no , " George Bull said . " But the taxes  | ought to be along pretty soon . You are n't going to waste them on civic improvements , are you ? " Steadily smiling , Henry Harris said : " We have to pay the Board of Health , I guess . I always believe in sharing the Lord 's bounty with the deserving . It 's kind of hard when Herring squeezes the buffalo off every nickel ; but if it were left to me , George , I 'd see you were rewarded in a way commensurate with your sterling abilities . At present my assets are mostly good will . " " Uh , huh , " agreed George Bull . " So are mine , Henry ; so are mine . If you ever burn your hand on red-hot money , you can have my professional services gratis . " He started to move toward his car . " Oh , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to see me about ? " " No , nothing important . The Democrats are having a little meeting tomorrow night . Just discussing our policies , and so on . Would n't care to look in , would you ? " " I 'd be sort of out of place , would n't I ? " " A lot of thinking people are going to vote Democratic this fall , George . I had an idea you were getting on pretty bad terms with the Republicans . Or maybe I should say the Mrs. Bannings . She 's doing her best to get you into trouble . And now I hear Emma Bates is going around saying things . That does n't seem the right way to treat a regular party man . " " Well , Mrs. Banning 's been doing her best for a long time , and it does n't seem any too good , Henry . As for Emma , she 's mostly wind . Quimby and Ordway would want something more substantial . The School Committee would have run me out long ago if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . " " You 've got me and Paul Lane . We 've always stood  | up for you . So 's Ordway , on occasion . The Bannings do n't own the town yet . I 'm not saying they have n't influence with their gang of boot-lickers ; that 's just what I mean . You never know when they may pull a fast one on you . I think you 're in the wrong camp , George . " " It 's mighty nice of you to be so worried about it , Henry . Now , what were you thinking you 'd like to have me do for you ? " " Absolutely nothing . I just hate to see a man knifed in the back . Of course , we 'd be glad to have your vote ; but we are n't buying them . We 're going to get too many free this fall . " " Henry , ingratitude 's a terrible sin . I hope you 'll never find me guilty of it . " + Wednesday morning , George Bull 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any comfort . He came downstairs grumpy , and Aunt Myra said at once : " My goodness , George , you look like a tramp ! You go to that barber shop and let somebody shave you . " " Let 's have some breakfast . " " I 'm not ready yet . You can sit down if you want . " " Where 's Susie ? " " Oh . Susie . Well , Pete came up with a note from Mrs. Andrews . Susie 's sick in bed . " " She would be ! Jumping Jupiter , it 's a puny bunch we have around here ! Man , woman , and child , they have n't the guts of a two-day kitten . All lie in bed and holler for  | the doctor . Want me to dose them up with a lot of rubbish and tell them how brave they are in their afflictions . Even a spell of nice warm weather 's more than they can stand . I know of ten cases lying around feeling weak and wanting somebody to wait on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't feel good ; they got a belly ache ; they just seem all worn out ? " " Well , it 's a good thing those snakes do n't bite you often , George . Looks to me as though you got out the wrong side of bed this morning . There are some prunes for you , and do n't use all that cream on them . It 's got to do your oatmeal and coffee , too ? " " God Almighty ! There 's the door bell . Ca n't a man even eat in peace ? " " You better sit still . I 'll see who it is . " When she came back , she said : " It 's that Ward boy , from the Bannings ' . " " What 's he want ? " " Wants to see you . He looks kind of peaked . I suppose he is n't feeling well . " " Huh ! Why do n't they get Verney up ? I guess they figure he is n't worth it . Horse doctor will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his office ten minutes later , George Bull looked into the waiting room . Larry Ward was sitting slumped in a chair by the front window . " All right , come in , " George Bull said . " Might as well see you , since you 're here . My morning hours are from nine to ten . Do n't come banging around at half-past eight next time . " He closed the door . " Sit down . Well , you look kind of green . What 's the trouble ? " Larry clasped both hands together , swallowing . He  | shifted in the chair . Finally he said , hushed , " I think I got something , Doc . " " Oh , you do , do you ? Well , what have you got ? " Larry gulped again , wordless , and George Bull snorted . " Uh , huh , " he agreed . " Well , do n't get in a sweat . This is n't the Y.M.C.A. When do you think you got infected ? " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fooling with Betty Peters ? " " No , I never ? " " You going to tell me you must have got it off a towel ? Have to be a minister to manage that . Where did you get it ? " Finally he said , " I guess it must have been Charlotte Slade , Doc . She 's the only one ? " " That kid ? When did you have intercourse with her ? " " I guess it was a week ago Friday . I felt pretty rotten for a couple of days , now . I ? " " Well , she 's certainly starting young . All right . We 'll have a short arm inspection . Do n't get the wind up ; we 'll take care of you . Just come over here ? " When he had finished he said , " There 's nothing wrong with you . What are you , crazy ? Charlotte tell you she had something ? " " You mean , I 'm all right , Doc ? " " Sure , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to wonder about it . I did n't think it was very likely with a kid like that ? " He considered Larry , standing stupid in his incredulous relief . " Got any reason to think you were n't the first ? " " Oh , she said I was ; but ? " " Well , the odds are you were . Somebody always has to be . Old man Slade 's been afraid of God for forty years  | and so he gets back at life by making the women and children afraid of him . Charlotte is n't old enough to have stopped being scared of him long . Do you mean business ? " " Hell , I do n't know , Doc . " " If you do n't , stick to girls old enough to know what they 're doing . You 'll find plenty of them . Once is an accident ; might happen to any one . But if it goes on , and by any chance I see her start swelling , this town 'll be too hot for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars , just to help you remember . And tell her if she is n't regular this month to come up here and I 'll see what we can do . " " All right , " Larry said . " But , listen , Doc . Just the same I feel pretty bum . I mean , kind of sickish ? " " That 's called the fear of God . Take a dose of castor oil tonight and go to bed early . Generally fixes it up . " Larry grinned uncertainly . " All right , " he repeated . " I got to admit I feel some better . I was certainly scared , Doc . " " You were . But you get over it pretty quick . Until the next time . You better think about marrying Charlotte . She can give you all there is , and it might save you plenty of trouble and expense . Nice little kid , in spite of her old man . Beat it . " With Larry gone , he set himself to putting a new dressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of it , he could remember Charlotte Slade 's birth . Or maybe it was the Slade boy , who was killed in a motor accident . When he got there the baby was just about born , with Mrs. Slade yelling as loud as she could , and Slade , who did n't think it was decent to be present , yelling prayers in the front room even louder . On second thought , he decided that it was Charlotte , not the boy . The boy had been  | born in winter . George Bull guessed that he himself was at least twenty years older , but Slade seemed something left from a long time ago . Old man Slade preserved a sort of mean and comic rusticity which might have been general once in the outlying farms . Even sixteen or seventeen years back there had been little of it left  --  it was hard to believe that those illiterate , goat-bearded farmers , stubborn and credulous , had ever existed . Well , they had , all right . Their vanishing was part of the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught up by the heels while he slapped the breath into her , was being seduced by what had once appeared a perpetually fixed brat in rompers . George Bull gazed at his thumb and he thought that he could almost see the proof of age . The first steps in healing looked reluctant . Other people , perhaps , had n't got around to noticing , but to his own body he was old man Bull , hardly worth the effort . Cresting the swell of inflamed flesh , the angry crust of the still frail blood clot filled the criss-cross slash like a red mark of his certain mortality . In the hall the telephone rang . Aunt Myra must have been close enough to reach it , for he heard her almost at once screaming into the mouthpiece : " Hello ? " " Tell them I 'll be over when I can , " he called . " I 've got to go down and get shaved . Who is it ? " He could hear her gabbling a form of this information and then she hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's Mrs. Bates , George . She wants you to see Geraldine . " " Huh ! Changed her tune , has she ? Well , we 'll let her stew awhile . I 've got half a dozen visits to make . Doubt if I get back for lunch . "  | " I expect I 'll go to Sansbury , George . I 'll leave an apple pie in the pantry and there 's plenty of milk , if you want anything . " " You better hang around and answer the telephone . " " No , I 'm going to Sansbury , George . There 's a picture I want to see . I 'll ask that little girl at the telephone to write down any calls and you can ring her up from wherever you are and ask her . There 'll be plenty of sickness , I daresay . Mr. Cole 's mother always said a green Christmas makes a full churchyard , and ? " " This is n't Christmas , Aunt Myra . " " Well , I expect it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up the five dollar bill which Larry had laid on the desk and went to the door . " Take this along , " he said . " You might see something you want . " " I can manage , thank you , George . I 've got my fares and twenty-five cents for the theatre . I do n't want to be a burden to any one and those people keep sending me the checks . I must say it 's very kind of them . " " Do n't you worry about them , Aunt Myra . Alfred spent most of his life trying to pay for that insurance . " Taking her hand , he pressed the five dollar bill in it , closing the fingers . " Now do n't put it in the stove , " he said , " it 's money . " Louie , his loose hand working in the lather spread on Doctor Bull 's chin , said : " I hear Mr. Jackson 's sick ? " He tipped his head indicatively toward the wall which concealed Gosselin Brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and opened up , but he went home pretty soon . Gus Ferris said he was awful shaky . He was going to get Mrs. Jackson to come over and help Gus , but she has n't come , so I suppose he must be real sick . I hear you got a lot of patients . " " Quite a few . It looks like a mild form of influenza , whatever that is . I 'm damned if I know how to help them . That what you want to know ? " Louie laughed . " Sure , " he admitted . " Lot of people ask me . Not contagious , is it ? " " Very likely . It 's been spreading around somehow . " " I was over shaving Joe Tupping . He do n't feel so good . If I get it from him , I 'm going to be mad . I fixed it up to go to New York over this weekend . " " Well , I would n't worry . It does n't amount to anything . Come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . " He lay practically prostrate in the chair , staring at the pattern of the once-white-painted , stamped sheet tin which covered the ceiling . Louie , getting through his preliminaries in a burst of activity , smeared down the side of his face and applied his razor . " What the devil have you got there ? " George Bull roared . " A meat ax ? " Louie lifted the razor . " You grow an awful tough beard , Doc . I 'll give it a couple more licks . " He struck the strop a few times with it . " I hear you 're turning Democrat , Doc . " " That 's news to me . Did n't hear it from Henry Harris , by any chance , did you ? " " Somebody said something about some row you had with Bates . " " Well , you tell Henry that when I want a row I know  | how to make one . He does n't have to think up any for me . " " I thought Mrs. Bates was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday . Today she 's been ringing me up and wanting me to rush right over and look at Geraldine . Guess we 'll have a truce as long as she thinks she needs me . While you 're at it , you can just spread that around . But Henry ought n't to stick his nose in so far . First thing he knows he 'll find it pulled off . " George Bull clasped and unclasped his left hand . " Come on ! Hurry up ! I 've got to see all these invalids ! " + Janet Cardmaker , in breeches , boots , and a man 's white shirt with the collar open on her thick neck , sat on the kitchen steps in the noon sun . At the corner of her lips a neglected cigarette smoked itself away . The many folded sections of last Sunday 's New York Times lay on her lap . Occasionally she read a paragraph at random ; mainly she looked past the barn and the bare apple trees . A confused , unready touch of spring showed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunny fields ; the buds on some bushes were already big and beginning to split . The valley was filled with vague haze in the mild , windless sunlight . Out in the lot she could see the formidable fawn-colored shoulders of Moloch III , moving with sullen majesty in the radius of the forty feet of thin steel cable which attached his ringed nose to a stake . He was the biggest Jersey bull she had ever seen ; he must weigh more than fif-  | teen hundred pounds , and that in a small breed which did n't run to fat . Really , he was too good for this herd ; but she hated to sell him at a time when nobody would want to pay anything like what he was worth . It might be better to buy a couple of heifers fit for him , and see what she got . She threw the cigarette down , turning her head and calling , deep voiced , through the kitchen door : " When do we have lunch ? " Mrs. Foster answered , " About twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another place . Doctor Bull 's coming up . " She could hear more distinctly now the sound of a motor which had attracted her attention , changing gears to get up the bad road . She sat still on the steps until it came in sight beyond the barnyard and turned in the gate . George Bull drove it close to the steps and banged the door open . " You have n't eaten , have you ? " she asked . " They do n't give me time . " " We 'll have something in about twenty minutes . " She stood up . " I hear a snake bit you . Is it all right ? " " Sore as hell . I had to cut it all up . Well , I went and asked for it . Hurts my patients more than it does me , I guess . Moloch looks pretty good out there . " " I guess I 'll keep him . Sit down . " She went into the kitchen , presently returning with a couple of the crystal wine glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crest . Setting them on the step , she took a jack knife from her pocket , levered a corkscrew from one side of it , sank it with a muscular twist and drew the cork of the whiskey bottle . " This is from Sansbury , on your pre-  | scription , " she observed , sniffing it . " I guess it 's better than Anderson 's . " She sat down and filled the wine glasses . " What are you so busy about ? " " Healing the sick . " He raised the glass and swallowed half of it . " That is pretty good . Oh , a lot of them collapsed when the sun hit them and curled up . They should have stayed under their stones . We 'll get a blizzard next week . " " Who 's sick ? " " The whole bunch . Regular epidemic . A good many may be just malingering , but Ralph Kimball looks like acute nephritis . We may not see much more of him . Perhaps it has nothing to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something like that Spanish ' flu . Stay out of town awhile . It seems to be running around . A cold snap will probably finish it off . " " You do n't seem much worried . " " It 's their hard luck , not mine . Nothing to be done , except see how it comes out . It takes a lot of forms , this influenza . For all we could do about it , some specially bad sort might start up again any time . Wipe out three quarters of the human race , given a real start . " " No great loss . Speaking of loss , I hear the Talbot girl 's death got the gang down on you . " " Some of the women took it to heart . Emma Bates was all set to give me a piece of her mind . Her idea was I should have been there that afternoon . " " What 's your idea ? " " That 's mine , too , " admitted George Bull . " Not that I could have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonsense they think up to milk the paying customers  --  but I could certainly have saved myself a lot of  | dirty looks . Emma was pretty riled . She never did get rid of that piece of mind , so she spent a week chewing it for anybody who 'd listen . I could see her at Mamie 's funeral wondering whether she could n't get Doctor Wyck to have me ejected . " " Who else was unhappy ? " " About everybody , I guess . Except Howard Upjohn . He got some cash business  --  Banning 's cash , I do n't need to say . And , of course , Mamie . Where she is now , she wo n't have to be an Episcopalian ; or clean up after the Bannings ; or give her money to her mother ; or wonder whether she 'll have a baby if she does . " " Blow over ? " " Sure . That was damn near two weeks ago . Even Emma was calling me up this morning . The real trouble was , I forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Science . ' " He lifted the glass and drank thoughtfully . " Funny thing , Janet , to see the change there . When I was first practicing , they kind of thought a doctor was a medicine man . They did n't know what it was all about ; he was sort of dabbling in the occult , and anything he did was all right with them . They do n't know any more now ; but they 've been reading the papers and they want some of that , not God knows what out of a bottle . You ought to see Verney 's place . Nurses sitting around in uniform making urinalyses . Half a ton of fluroscopic machines . Verney telling all the women to get undressed for a thorough examination . When he 's through , he has a four page record . Nine cases out of ten , , he does n't know a thing he could n't have found out by feeling a pulse and asking a couple of questions . Talk about the occult ! But everybody thinks when he 's written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women are purring like cats , wondering if he did n't think they looked pretty good in the raw . That 's giving them proper attention . People like the Bannings , who can pay for it , are going to have proper attention or know why not . " " Was Mrs. Banning at the Talbots ' ? " " No , just Herbert ; but she 's on her hind legs as usual . Henry Harris knows she 'd like to oust me from Medical Examiner to the School Board , and anything she wants , he seems to make it his special business to see she does n't get . I guess it annoys her a good deal . " " What 's that rat got against the Bannings , George ? I 've always wondered . " " I do n't know . Wish I did ; it might be good for a laugh . Maybe it 's just politics . Henry can get a lot of people into line voting Democratic for no reason at all except that Banning is a Republican . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half the people in town know that if they were in Banning 's place , they 'd think they owned the earth ; so that must be what he thinks .

" Janet laughed briefly , shook another cigarette from a flattened package and thrust it in her mouth . " They make me sick , " she said . " The whole lot of them . Kill all you want , George . " " Oh , they are n't so bad , as people go . They 're just trying to be free and equal . Fun watching them . I 've been right here for forty years and I 've never been what you 'd call bored .

"  | Three FOUR by six cut of a photograph taken from the crest of the Cobble showed the great steel towers of the finished transmission line crossing the valley at New Winton . There was also three quarters of a front page column about it . Henry Harris , examining the weekly issue of the Sansbury Times while he sat on the steps of Bates ' store Thursday morning , observed beneath the cut the minute italics : Courtesy Interstate Light &; Power and allowed himself to smile . You would n't catch Marden wasting money . Henry Harris ' interest , though detached , was personal . No one in New Winton knew it , and no one would be likely to guess from the Times ' vigorously Republican editorial attitude , but the controlling interest in the paper , and in the Times Print Shop , had long ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry Harris ' hands . Owning the Times was really one of Henry Harris ' amusements and by far the most expensive one . Not that it actually cost him anything , for the printing plant made up its deficit ; but he did sacrifice a possible profit for the pleasure afforded him weekly . Marden , a stumpy , swearing little man , was a fanatically honest and economical manager . Knowing , of course , that it would be good business for Henry Harris to scrap the paper , politics quite  | aside , Marden 's continued assaults on the Democrats , whether in Sansbury , Hartford , or Washington , had a subtle extra note of defiance . He felt that he was tilting , too , at Henry Harris ' indulgence . Every paragraph said also : " Put that in your pipe , Mr. Harris . If you do n't like it , you know what you can do . " Henry Harris , his warm private smile lighting over the current example of Marden 's valor , turned contentedly on to the section headed New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if Marden 's exaggerated blustering had n't been reward enough , Miss Kimball would certainly justify his extravagance . Miss Kimball 's importance rested entirely on this little job ; it made her feel that she was not merely the underpaid village Librarian , but actually somebody . Probably it contributed the assurance shown when she sided so haughtily with Mrs. Banning against Henry Harris . Not an unkind man , Henry Harris was content to enjoy the irony hard to miss in Miss Kimball 's rudeness to the person whose most casual word could knock out the props of her whole selfesteem . The spectacle of her skating with dignity on this ( had she only known ) thinnest possible ice , tickled him . She did not ever mention Henry Harris , just to pay him for daring to differ with Mrs. Banning . As he did not wish to be mentioned , Miss Kimball was not only funny but perfectly satisfactory . He read : Mr. Norman Hoyt , the well-known artist , is planning to start on a motor trip to Santa Fe , New Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three months . Accompanying Mr. Hoyt will be Miss Valeria Hoyt , his daughter ; and Miss Virginia Banning , daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Herbert Tracy Banning . This item was the unquestioned cream of Miss Kimball 's  | news ; but immediately under it appeared the line : Mr. Ralph Kimball is confined to his home by a slight illness . Henry Harris chuckled . " Next thing to nepotism , " he remarked . Lester Dunn , letting the store door close behind him and standing still on the step , said : " What the hell are you mumbling about , Henry ? " " Just enjoying the news . Smart girl , Miss Kimball . I hope the Times appreciates her . Where are you going ? " " Nowhere . " Henry Harris folded the paper and tucked it in the pocket of his old corduroy coat . He pointed a pipe stem at his car , standing isolated by the pavement edge . " Come on , " he said , " I 'll take you there . " " What 's up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced at Lester . " You do n't look so hot . Got a hangover ? " " Oh , I got a damn cold or something . I feel lousy . What 's the trouble ? " " No trouble yet . You 're probably getting this influenza I hear so much about . " " Bunk . It 's something I ate . " Driving slowly down the green , Henry Harris said , " How 's Doc Bull 's hand ? " " Do n't know . I have n't seen him since Tuesday . " " Saw him Tuesday myself . By the way , he did n't say anything to you , did he ? " " No . " " I 've got a notion he did n't hear anything that time . But he may think something 's up . It would be sort of uncomfortable if he does . More I think of it , the more I 'm afraid passion betrayed me , Lester . "  | " What does that mean ? " " Well , you see the whole business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have started it if I had n't felt the urge to annoy my friend Matthew . He needs to be heated up every little while so he wo n't mildew . But ? " He shook his head thoughtfully . " Listen , Henry , I 'm sorry , but I 've spent that money , if you 're thinking about a refund and calling it off . Besides what difference does it make if Doc Bull knows ? What will he do ? " " Probably nothing . But I like a neat job . " He laughed . " You can usually take a chance on big things , Lester ; but you have to be awful careful about little ones . Well , we 'll try to mop up the spilt milk . Maybe it 'll be a lesson to me . " " Lesson about what ? " " Maybe about paying people in advance . " " Watch out ! " Lester said . A glittering black car , going fast , gave them a perfunctory blare of horn and was by . " Doctor Verney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess Virginia 'd better hurry up and get well if she 's going to accompany Mr. Norman Hoyt , the well-known artist , to New Mexico . " " They 're an awful lot of people sick in this town . Maybe Doc Bull will be so busy he wo n't get around to anything , anyway . " " Glad to hear it . What I 'm worrying about is his getting around to see the mess the Interstate people left that camp in . I 'm going to send Albert Foster up as soon as he gets off the job he 's doing for Ordway . I hate to pay somebody else three dollars a day when Albert would do it for two fifty . "  | " Why did n't you make them clean up themselves ? " " Oh , that Snyder chap was kind of sore . I soaked them pretty hard for rent . That land on the hill is n't worth anything . They could have bought the whole mountain for less . They were late and wanted to get out so I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to Doc Bull ? " " Nothing , but if he wanted to , he 'd probably figure out a way for the Board of Health to fine me . It 's right on the edge of the water supply area . After the way he got Banning about the dumping , anything might happen . " " Doc Bull would never bother to go up there . Being Board of Health here 's just a racket . Keep your shirt on , Henry . We may make some money yet . Listen , drive over to my place , will you ? I got the trots . Been on the run all morning . " " You better take a dose of something and go to bed . We 'll never make any money with you laid up . Sure , being Board of Health 's a racket ; but you ca n't expect Doc Bull to run himself ragged for three hundred dollars a year salary . " + A traveling clock whose silver face could be folded away in its supporting case of pale gray morocco was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banning , shifting her head a little on the pillow , could see that it was five minutes of nine . Waiting a moment , concerned , to find out how she felt , she decided that today  | she was all right . There was perhaps a trace of faintness , a hint of yesterday 's bad headache , but both would probably go as soon as she had some coffee . Relieved , she remembered wondering , when she felt so rotten Tuesday and yesterday , if she were really going to be sick . She had not quite dared ask Doctor Verney how long what he called a touch of influenza might last , but her misery had a solid permanence which could easily mean a week or two . The Hoyts would n't be able to wait that long . Brooding on the possible malice of fate so serving her , she had concluded that nothing could be more like life or her luck . You could see in it the dreary pattern of too many remembered anticipations which had somehow come to nothing . In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like the first idea of going to Paris , motoring to Santa Fe had an ecstatic desirability which at once jeopardized it , made it inherently improbable . Frowning a little , she could even recall thinking , in feverish extravagance , that probably there was a God . Knowing that she regarded him as a lot of nonsense , God was always on the alert to pay her sauciness with the inspired punishments of a loving kindness which did not care if she were really injured and never made any mistake about what could hurt and disappoint her most . She drew a breath , not wanting even now to tempt Heaven with too scornful a rejection of that possibility , and lifted her head enough to see that the morning was once more clear , the sunlight still warm on the trees . Shifting her head again , something arrested her . She came up sharply on one elbow , staring with a jolt of alarm at her pillow . How it could have got there was a mystery for the moment sinister and appalling , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by relief . Asleep , she must have suffered a slight nose bleed . Bringing her hand to her face , she could feel blood dried on her nostril and lip . " God , what a lousy mess ! " she said . She threw back the covers and sat up , indignant . The violence of the motion made her giddy , so she sat a moment , recovering her balance . Finally , standing up , impatient , she made for the bathroom door . Almost there , she was forced to realize in new , dismayed anger that she was n't completely over her illness . An abrupt tightening cramp stabbed her bowels , a wave of sickness rushed up from them , landing with a painful impact inside her skull . The echo of it jarred , lingering , in her ears . The handle resisted her . She tugged harder , half in support , trying to make her wrist turn . Something gave suddenly , but it was only the surface of the knob sliding on her palm , now lubricated disgustingly with sweat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cramping nausea . Sweat was all over her now , and at once she was aware of cold , like a breeze on her . Down her back , under her arms , across her breast , the skin crawled , quailing from this strong draft . She put a bare foot out uncertainly , interrupting her partial stagger , held the sliding door knob and braced her other hand on the jamb while her body seemed suddenly porous , like weak white ice frozen full of air . She must get back to bed , and she found herself phrasing it through the hard chatter of her teeth : But I would rather go to bed  --  the word bed was seized by a paroxysmal multiplication , a leaning tower of many million paperthin but hard sounds soaring past view or reach . Shaken  | too violently to stand , her legs melted , her icy hands astoundingly failed . She went down on her side , in the weak relief of this surrender anticipating , even as immediately she felt , the cruel remote pain of bone banged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned sideways . Opening , the door seemed only to have been waiting for this . But it was the other door , she realized . The bathroom door had not relented . " Take that damn knob down ? " she managed to say . " You ca n't get in ? " Seeing that it was her mother , Virginia made at once an effort to get up . She would never convince any one that she was all right and able to go ; even what she said was crazy . Shutting her eyes , she forced an order into the words : " I meant , the door , not the knob ? " Picked up , she could feel her own lightness and it amazed her ; she weighed nothing . She could have floated on the ringing air . " Virginia , darling ? " " Leave me alone , " she whispered automatically . " I just slipped ? " The bed mounted and met her shoulders and numb buttocks and light legs with a soft , intolerable jar . " Oh , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother , my head aches ? " She got her chill wet hands to her forehead , palms grinding her eyebrows . She rolled her face into the pillow . In this hammer of pain she could hear another voice  --  it was Mary  --  crying : " Oh , the poor lamb ! There , now ? you go on , M'am . There , Miss Ginny ? "  | " Hello , " Virginia murmured , perplexed by the positiveness with which she could recognize Doctor Verney by his hands , by touch and a distinctive washed smell . His grave oval face and intent brown eyes moved , smiling . " Hello , Ginny . What have you been up to ? " " I just sort of fainted , I guess ? " But fainting , she saw at once , did not in the least describe it . " Have I been asleep ? " " I guess you have . How do you feel ? " " I 'm all right . My head hurt so damn much ; but not now . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let 's see the tongue . Now , wide open . That 's it . All right . " " Am I going to be well . I mean , Monday . Am I ? " " I do n't know why not ! Only you must n't keep getting out of bed . A little fever can weaken you a lot . Know that now , do n't you ? " " I had a nose bleed . " " That 's a nuisance ; but at least it does n't hurt much , does it ? You stay in bed today and tomorrow . Saturday you ought to be all right . What would you like to eat ? " " Nothing . " " How about some ice cream ? " " No . But I 'd like some water ice . I 'd like some lemon water ice if they could get some . " " All right . Ice cream would give you a little nourishment ; but if you do n't feel like it , do n't eat it . " " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All right . Here 's a thermometer . Do n't eat that . " He put out a hand , bringing into view a gold wrist watch . His fingers closed on her wrist . Virginia , interested , saw that the watch bore an amazing long thin second-hand which  | made the whole round of the dial rapidly . Moved to comment on it , the thermometer halted her , so she made a vague circular motion with her finger . " That 's right , " he agreed , smiling . " It 's supposed to be easier to see . Got it for my birthday . " + Her head , crowned by a preposterous black bonnet , was tilted reflectively to the side . She kept pursing her lips , making while she did it , George Bull knew , small decisive clicks with her tongue . She walked right past the path up to the house . George Bull , leaving his car by the roadside , said , " Whoa ! Where are you bound , Aunt Myra ? " Stopping short on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinking . " Oh , George ! My , you startled me ! Well , I 've been to see Susie . I just wanted to see for myself how sick she was . " " She 'll be all right . " " Maybe she will , and maybe she wo n't . I 'm not setting myself up against you , George , but I can tell you one thing . I know now what 's wrong with that girl , and likely with all these other people . " " You do , do you ? Well , I wish I did . " " Now , do n't you go laughing at me . When I was stopping with Mr. Cole 's sister in New Haven , I learned all I need to about that . They had it in every other house . That little niece of mine , what 's her name , had it . It all came just the same way . Now , George , what Susie 's got 's typhoid fever , sure as you 're alive . "  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Susie who 's sick , not that niece of yours . " " It wo n't do you any good , telling me not to believe it . I know . It 's from drinking dirty water . Back whenever it was the water ran all dirty , I just said to myself : Myra , you watch out ! ' " " Just a little mud , Aunt Myra . You can drink all you want of it . " " Well , George , I do n't believe you can . They had doctors in New Haven as good as you are , and they said that 's what it was . That was in the year 1901 . I remember . " " Typhoid fever is a disease caused by a specific organism , bacillus typhosus , Aunt Myra . Does n't grow on trees . That organism has to be in the water . It can be clear water or muddy water ; that has n't anything to do with it . " " Maybe you 're right , George . I do n't know anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typhoid fever . I can smell , George . I know what it smells like . " " You can what ? " " A person has a smell , George . It 's not a subject I 'm going to discuss , but I 'd know that smell anywhere . " " Listen , Aunt Myra ; you ca n't have typhoid fever without getting it from some one ! Now , nobody around here has had it . In forty years , there has n't been a single case in this village . Matter of fact , it is n't easy to find a case anywhere nowadays ! " " Do n't you go shouting at me , George . People might think you were n't so sure of what you 're talking about , getting all excited that way . Now , you can call it anything you 've a mind to . What concerns me is that Susie wo n't be of her bed for six weeks , supposing the Lord spares  | her ; so I 'm just going on up the road to see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meanwhile . " " Lot of foolishness ! You wait a couple of days ? " " Now , George , with all these people sick , there 's no sense in waiting . Everybody 'll be wanting help . You go look in the water for some of those things , if you think they 're there . " " You ca n't see them by just looking in the water , Aunt Myra . You ? " " When , then ; what makes anybody think there are any , I 'd like to know . " " You 'd have to make a microscopic examination for evidence of fecal pollution ? " " Land sakes , then ; why do n't you take down that microscope you have sitting year in and year out on that closet shelf and use it ? " " It 's quite a trick , Aunt Myra . Not much in my line . " " Well , I have n't any time to stand here arguing . If you ca n't find out yourself , it seems to me you 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fix lunch directly . " Grinning a little , he watched her depart . " That 's a good one , " he thought . " How would I know it was there if I could n't see it ? Why , I 'd send my specimens to Torrington and let a lot of girls do it for me . " It would be girls , probably . Some little wench , as likely as not called Doctor What-is-it ! It certainly seemed that women had a natural aptitude for bacteriology  --  or maybe one naturally evolved . If you watched one of them so much as flaming a platinum loop to fish in a test tube you got the point . They were effortlessly adept at the delicate scratching of culture surfaces , the casual quick trick of heat fixation without spoiling the smear or cracking the  | slide . Slight shoulders hunched in a familiar minute absorption ; the clean narrow fingers faintly scarred , in patient practiced movement ; absorbed faces with a light gleam of sweat  --  men did it , not often so neatly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but these young women knew how to treat it as an end in itself . The implanted tradition of fine needlework had found an unforeseen outlet . In his office , Doctor Bull set down his bag . " Typhoid ! " he thought . " That would be quite a show ! Certainly make all the castor oil I 've dished out not such a good idea ! " He search slowly along the line of books until he found the faded letters : W. Budd  --  Typhoid Fever , its mode of spreading and prevention . London . 1873 . That was a great book in the old days ; probably still was . Of course , treatment kept changing . It was n't so long ago that Johns Hopkins , giving out the gospel , was starving patients as near death as not on the milk diet . Last he 'd heard , they were yipping for forty-five hundred calories . Of course , they might have changed their minds again by now . George Bull could n't , personally , recall ever treating a typhoid case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trips to the Detroit hospital when he was at school , and you certainly heard plenty about the theory of it , but as for the real thing ? He flipped open the pages of Budd at random and read : . . . exhibited in turn all the most characteristic marks of the disorder . . . spontaneous and obstinate diarrhoea , tympanitis , dry tongue , low delirium , and other typhoid symptoms , together with ( towards the end of the second week ) the now well-known eruption of rose-colored spots . . .  | Well ! The disease did n't change ; it was only the doctors . To have one of those smart young women would be kind of a help . He guessed they used the colon bacillus for an indicator of polluted water . Whether you could see it without staining and a lot of special tricks , he certainly did n't know . Probably not ; and how would he recognize it if he did see it ? The answer was , he would n't . " No sense bothering , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he dragged down the case . Age and dust had darkened the varnished surfaces ; he soiled his hands as he pushed back the catch . He brought out the microscope and set it on his desk . " Humph ! " he said , half amused , for he could remember buying it at a state medical convention fully twentyfive years ago . He and a physician from Waterbury had spent a jovial afternoon in a saloon , and somehow it all ended in getting the microscope . His companion had noticed it in a pawn shop window . It bore the name of famous German makers ; at the time it had been the very last word , and nothing was wrong with it but a first objective missing from the nose-piece . That , according to his companion , could either be replaced at small cost by writing to the makers , or not bothered about . In bacteriological research it was of no great value anyway . George Bull grinned , for he supposed that he must have represented himself as anxious to do such work ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged in it . Dipping a swab of cotton in alcohol , George Bull wiped the eye-piece and cleaned the stage . The illuminating mirror was badly clouded . The rack and pinion of the coarse adjustment seemed to have stuck , but finally he made it turn . Not wanting to use his right thumb , the graduated  | screw head of the fine adjustment resisted him even longer . Taking a handkerchief , he cleaned the condenser and the two objectives . With one eye dosed , the other squinting in , he could see that plenty of dust remained . Particles of it , four hundred and forty times enlarged , littered the stage between the reflected enormous branches of his own bent eyelashes . " Hell ! " he said aloud . " This is n't getting me any-where ! " He straightened up . He took the book that he had laid down and leaning back began to read again . There was one thing about it , he reflected , there was n't one of them who could n't be displaying prodromal symptoms . Shutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , snapped it open . Arising , he began to gather together what he needed . " Maybe one hunch is as good as another , " he said . Jerking his car to a halt in front of the Kimball house , he walked up the path . It was Miss Kimball who opened the door and he said : " I want to see your father . I 'll go right up . " Disconcerted , she stammered : " Oh , well , I think he 's asleep . ' Would n't later ? " " I 'll wake him up . " He brushed past her , leaving her staring , outraged , as he mounted the stairs . In the upper hall he pushed open the door of the sick room . " How 're you feeling , Ralph ? " he asked . " We 'll have a little light in here . " He went and pulled up the drawn shade . " This is n't going to bother you any . " He set his bag on the table . From it he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he held up and shook . The door moved now and he saw Miss Kimball .  | Still affronted , she said with a thin dignity : " Would you be kind enough to tell me what you are planning to do ? " " I will . I want to make a blood test . Come on , Ralph . Brace up . " Sitting on the edge of the bed , he shoved back the loose sleeve of the night shirt . Unscrewing the cap of the iodine bottle , he pressed a swab over the mouth , daubed a wide smear on the pallid blue line of the median basilic vein below the elbow joint . " There 's an alcohol burner , " he said to Miss Kimball , " and here 's a match . Take the cap off and light it . No , bring it here where I can reach it ! Now you 'd better look the other way or get out . One or the other . Do n't go keeling over as soon as you see blood . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the veins engorged , flamed the needle and jabbed it through the iodine-painted skin . " All right , Ralph , " he said , " that did n't hurt you any ? " Glancing at the graduations in the glass , he pinched it off at fifteen cubic centimeters , freeing the needle . " That 's it . " He took the stained swab , smearing the arm again . " I ' 11 be in tomorrow , " he told Miss Kimball . " We may be getting somewhere . How we 'll like it when we get there , I do n't know . Pull that shade down again if the light bothers him . " Stirring on the bed , Ralph Kimball said hoarsely : " Feeling kind of bum , George . None of that stuff you gave me seems to do much good ? " " Well , that 's the way with most of the stuff we give , " George Bull answered . " Some times it helps ; usually it doesn't. "  | To Miss Kimball , still looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty careful about washing your hands when you 've been in here ? " He considered her cheerfully and added , " Be a good idea to see that you sterilize the bed pan and contents before disposing . Lysol 's as good as anything else . If the feces are n't fluid , stir ' em up well . " The pin at the low " V " of the ironed-down collar George Bull recognized as St. Luke 's . She looked up from the desk , showing him , under the cap and rumpled reddish hair , large brown faintly oblique eyes in a demure short face . George Bull thought : " I could use that ! " He said : " I 'm Doctor Bull , from New Winton . I want to see Doctor Verney on an urgent matter . " " Yes , Doctor Bull ? " Her voice had the automatic , submissive respect for physicians learned in the exact discipline of her hospital . " Doctor Verney is at luncheon ; but I 'll tell him , at once . " She arose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He stood , however , watching a moment the trim departing shift of her narrow shoulders , the precise desirable stir of her small buttocks under the immaculate uniform . " Ho , hum ! " he grunted , and looked out the reception room window . Over the long lawns , down the four leisurely spaced rows of great elms , flat on the narrow asphalt surface of the road known as Stockade Street  --  humbler Sansbury called it Millionaire 's Row  --  sunlight fell pale and chill from a sky becoming overcast . There was an air of well-  | to-do , but not rich nor fashionable , respectability in the bad architecture of the ample houses . The clumping of shrubbery , the generous spacing of the trees  --  each flagged sidewalk was forty feet from the edges of the asphalt road  --  seemed more suburban than rural . All was vaguely old fashioned , the work of prosperous years in the ' 9os when Sansbury had been a quiet , informal summer resort for a few New York families who joined with the modestly monied best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tastes had ended it . To present-day eyes , Sansbury was left the poorer , for several fine old houses had been replaced by bad , bigger ones . Stockade Street lost actual continuity with its long past . It gained only an immense bowlder to which was fastened a bronze plate marking the site of the 17th century blockhouse , and an atrocious memorial library constructed of cobble stones . Across the street , toward the end , George Bull could just see the slate roofs , the dank red brick breaking out in eruptions of heavy woodwork  --  objectless bay windows , a small tower , graceless oversized verandas  --  of what had once been the Ross place . It was hard to believe , but he could remember making long drives down in a buggy , entertaining seriously the idea of marrying Maud Ross ? or , he guessed he ought to say , marrying the First National Bank of Sansbury . Maud had been a blankly plain , perhaps a little popeyed , girl with her mess of hair bundled up off a neck tightly protected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it had n't been possible to act very enthusiastic about her . Maud would certainly be pretty cold mutton , and though he finally forced himself  | to make a proposal , it was rejected . He could remember Maud unreally saying that she had never guessed that his sentiments were of That Sort . She would long ago have felt bound to tell him that she was not Free ; she had an Understanding with Another . This absurd untruth merely added to the constraints of the situation . George 's listlessness had been , perhaps by a very narrow margin , too marked . Frigidly aghast at her own doubtless uncertain idea of human copulation , she would have to be pressed to the ordeal harder than George could make himself press her . The decision had , in all likelihood , been a hard and unhappy one ; for certainly , her fabrications properly discounted , it looked as though he must be her man , or she 'd have no man at all  --  the suddenly recalled measures of that old tune went through his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the nurse coming back , her short face sweetly sensual , her pert flanks shifting . " To bed ! To bed ! " he thought , his appetite willingly tickled again . " Doctor Verney will be right out , Doctor Bull . Wo n't you wait in his office ? " On the walls here , visible from the armchair in which he seated himself , were three framed diplomas in cumbersome Latin  --  Harvard , Johns Hopkins , Vienna  --  George Bull guessed that the Vienna one was nothing much  --  six months fooling around with psychoanalysis or something . " Huh ! " he thought , " all the fixings ! " Doctor Verney came now through the door at the end . " Glad to see you , Doctor . Something up ? " He went and closed the door to the reception room . " Have a cigar . " " All right . " George Bull took it from the held-out mahogany case . " Nothing wrong with them , is there ? " Doctor Verney laughed . " Not that I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the day . I like a cigar after dinner . " He sat down behind the massive , polished desk . " All right , hoot ! " " Well , first of all , tell me something about the Banning girl 's case . Just what do you make of it ? " Doctor Verney , he saw , was embarrassed . He picked up a paper weight , balanced it , set it down . Then he picked it up again . " Why , Doctor , I really do n't make much of it . The patient 's general condition is a little below par , and any trifling infection hits her harder than some people . It 's grippe , or influenza  --  loose term , but what else can you say ? Temperature about one hundred and two ; rather slow pulse . Headache . Coated tongue . Bowels are loose with a certain amount of griping . No appetite . We 've got her in bed and I think if she stays quiet there for a few days she 'll be perfectly well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven cases a good deal like that . Some of them seem sicker than others ; a few have additional symptoms . They 've all come on since Monday . I 'm not satisfied with the diagnosis . Are you ? " " Yes , on the whole , I am . What 's your theory ? " Doctor Bull bent and opened his bag on the floor beside him . " Want to try an experiment ? " he asked , looking up . " I have a sample of blood here . Drew it in a syringe with a little citrate solution . I guess you have the facilities to see if you can grow anything from it . I 'd be interested . " " We could do it , all right . But what are you looking for ? " " Bacillus typhosus . In view of the Banning girl , I thought you might like to find out . " Doctor Verney set down the paper weight with an un-  | controlled bump . " Have you any reason to suspett such a thing ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have any you 'd admit , Verney . Your style is n't mine ; I 'm just an old horse doctor , you know . I have to work on hunches . In this case , I do n't mind telling you that I first thought of it when my aunt told me it was typhoid . I 've been thinking about it a lot since , and damned if I do n't pretty well believe the old lady 's right . " Doctor Verney relaxed a little . " It 's a hard diagnosis for a layman , Bull . " He smiled , recovering the paper weight . " Most doctors have some trouble with the early stages , too , I guess . Not much to choose . Sure you could n't be fooled ? " " I do n't mean to imply that . Short of rose spots , I could very easily miss it . It simply looks like a long shot to me ? unless you can lay your finger on a probable source of infection . Can you ? " " Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's no general distribution of milk . There has n't been anything like a church supper . No flies . The cases are all in town , which means that there are n't any among people who have their own water supply . " " That 's good reasoning , " admitted Doctor Verney . " But after all , it does n't show anything about the water . Unless there have been cases in the vicinity I really ca n't believe ? Well , I have a lot of respect for the opinion of a man of your experience ; you probably know more about real , practical medicine than most of us young fellows will ever learn ? " " I would n't be surprised , " agreed Doctor Bull . He  | could see the small disconcerted blink of Doctor Verney 's eyes , and laughed . " You must n't think I do n't appreciate your sentiment , " he said . " It just so happens that , barring bone setting , a few surgical tricks , and some push and pull obstetrics for women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there 's no such thing as practical medicine . Glad to hand on the torch . " " Oh , it seems to me we do some good ? " " Well , if you 're not interested in my aunt 's idea , I can go to Torrington . " " No , no . I 'd be glad to try it . There 's a perfectly good ten per cent bile solution out in the lab right now . We 'll fix it up and incubate it . We could get some agar plate smears tomorrow and see if we have anything . " He pressed a button on his desk . When the door opened , he said , " Oh , Miss Stanley , I want to do a blood culture . We 'll use that bile solution . I think there 's plenty left . Put two hundred cubic centimeters in an Erlenmeyer flask . Add ten of this specimen of Doctor Bull 's and shoot it in the incubator . " " Yes , Doctor Verney . " She went on past the desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consulting room . George Bull got a glimpse of sinks , shelves and a long table crowded with bottles and tube racks . " I was born thirty years too soon , " he observed . The door closed after Miss Stanley and he added : " You must find it quite a strain keeping chaste around here . " " Oh , no , " Doctor Verney protested . " She 's a nice girl , Bull . Comes from a fine family . " Uh , huh . Well , much obliged . " " I 'll let you know tomorrow . "  | + All Friday morning the cold west wind came bitter across the hills , poured hard and furious down the valley from North Truro . Off the worn bare earth of the playground beside the New Winton school , whirls of dust lifted and drove away . On high , this pale gritty haze trailed over the cemetery and rolled repeatedly past St. Matthias 's church before dispersing . May Tupping wrapped her old coat tight against the vicious edge of the gale . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noon , her face turned aside , her eyes half closed , stung to exasperation by that roaring , senseless violence . Every few minutes bleakly covered by the journeying clouds , the sun was brilliant , but without comfort . The bare trees groaned in their crotches ; a shutter banged ; a sheet of newspaper had glued itself , flapping , about the legs of the soldier on the monument . In the telephone office , Doris had a good fire . May struggled into this unstirred warmth , her cheeks whipped to color , her eyes watering from the last hard assault of the wind down the small sunless veranda . " Hello , " said Doris , yawning . " Oh , that 's the most awful wind ! And after it was so nice ? " " That freak weather could n't last long . How 's Joe 's cold ? " " He feels pretty bad today . " " That 's tough . Well , I 'll be getting on . Oh , say , listen ! The damnedest thing happened . About an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked her for a number , she  | said she did n't want any number . She just wanted to know if anybody was here . She said she was kind of scared , because there was a man out on the road who kept looking at her . Honestly , May , she sounded goofy . Then , another thing she said was , I should n't tell Doc Bull because if he knew about it he was going to come down and kill her . After that she tried to ring up twice more , but I 'd heard all I wanted to . I just disconnected . She has n't paid her bill for two months , I know , so we 're supposed to refuse her service Saturday , anyway . " " I know , " said May . " She has n't any money . I do n't know what on earth is going to happen to her . I suppose they 'll have to send her somewhere . " " Well , I should think they would . But , anyway , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 'll just give you the creeps , May . I 'm not fooling . " Sitting alone before the switchboard , May reflected that the worst part of Mrs. Talbot 's trouble was how little any of it was Mrs. Talbot 's fault . Her husband was dead . So was her son and her daughter . The same amazing clean sweep had been made of her relatives . Fifteen or twenty years ago there had been quantities of Millers up on Cold Hill and almost as many Darrows . Now she was the only Miller left . Of her father 's sister 's children there was none left  --  Jed Darrow 's widow and son could n't help even if they wanted to . Bill- Talbot had two brothers . Both of them had been in the Navy , and both of them were taken , dead , from a submarine which had lain three weeks , fatally injured , in the mud off New London . Mrs. Talbot was perhaps forty , and certainly looked nearer sixty . She had n't any money , and no means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she might even , as Doris suggested ,  | be really crazy . When you got a case like that , you could see what a help it was to be able to believe all partial evil , universal good , or to feel sure that God was punishing Mrs. Talbot for offenses so cunning that He alone saw them . Your reason might revolt at it , but at least it would give the speculative mind some peace . A possible security was implied . A little plan , which would make it impossible for such a torrent of disasters to touch you , was indicated ? I have been young and now am old , yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken , nor his seed begging bread . There had been a lull , but now came a quick flurry of calls : for different stores ; two for Doctor Bull , which Mrs. Cole answered ; one to ask what time it was . The laborious progress of May 's thought was interrupted ; but , in any event , she knew by now that thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several points that would look true ; or at least , look more likely to be true than several others ; but how could she tell , knowing so little ? She remembered thinking  --  she had probably been fifteen or sixteen , and had doubtless just begun to half see points  --  that what she wanted was an education . Miss Coulthard , at school , had been interested in her and they even made an effort to get a scholarship at Mt . Holyoke , but some one else got it . This was , of course , a disappointment ; for she had seen , amazed , page after page of college catalogues ranked solid with numbered course after course  --  three courses in Provencal ; fourteen courses in  | physics ; two half courses in the Kantian philosophy ; French literature from Ronsard to Rousseau ; three lectures a week for half a year on the history of Portugal . Seeing really nothing that she did not long to know all about , she would have done anything to go there . Or perhaps she should say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not quite crushed , although Miss Coulthard lost interest in her , she turned to the books in the New Winton library . When some one presented the library with the set of thirty-odd volumes containing all that was best in the world 's literature , it seemed to May at least a godsend . While she might never be really educated , in the sense that Miss Coulthard with her Vassar degree was , she would soon be well-informed . What she had expected , she could n't imagine ; but she saw presently that even when she had finished all the volumes she would not know anything in particular . She got , when she got anything for her patience , entertainment , not instruction . Facing such problems  --  surely the real meat of great minds  --  as why the Bannings should be rich , while Mrs. Talbot was destitute ; or why , when they were both out together , similarly armed , on a similar errand , it was Joe who was shot and not Harry Weems , she had nothing to fall back on except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common sense was your only resource , nothing remotely resembling any of the conflicting conclusions of the philosophers . She had read as much of a translation of Plato as seemed to fall into the class of best literature several times , thinking at first that because of her ignorance she had not understood , and in a minute she might see its relation to the realities of existence ; she saw instead that  | it really had none . It was pure wisdom , untouched by common sense . Left to herself , and to what she could see of the universe , real and ideal were lost together in an indifference so colossal , so utterly indifferent , that there was no defining it . This immense mindlessness knew no reasons , had no schemes ; there was no cause for it . Where could it begin , and why should it end ? There was even an error in personifying the universe as It , saying : How could It either plan or prevent Mrs. Talbot 's misfortunes ? How could It care ? " Only , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's terrible . It ought n't to be that way . " " This is the Sansbury operator . One-one , please , New Winton . " Making the connection , May could hear Doctor Bull 's voice , irritable , blare on the transmitter promptly . He must have been in the hall on the way out . " Sansbury calling , Doctor Bull . " Doctor Bull roared again , " Hello , hello  --  Operator , who the hell is ringing me ? " " One moment , please ? " " Hello ? Doctor Bull ? Doctor Bull , Doctor Verney is calling . I 'll connect you . " " Oh . That you , Verney ? Hello . Got something ? " " I 'm sorry to tell you that we certainly have . " Doctor Verney 's voice was clipped and urgent . " There 's no doubt about it at all . Your hunch is absolutely correct . Doctor Moses happened to be over from Torrington and I 've had  | him check up on it . He 's just out of school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naturally , I have n't done any work with that particular bacillus and I hoped I might be mistaken . I 'll be coming right up . If I can help you in any way ? I mean I suppose we ought to collect specimens all around and get them to Torrington ? " " Well , come on then ? " May let go the key . Doctor Verney 's agreeable tones and clear , educated accent always impressed her . Talking to you , he would n't make you feel so surely that he regarded your life or death as a matter of no importance , and considered you a fool to be roared at for bothering him about it . Whatever the present matter might be , she could see that he was genuinely concerned , ready to go to any trouble to do all he could . In the light of such a spirit , she wondered , as she had before , if it might not be possible to have him look at Joe some time . If Harry drove them down to the hospital , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he had been Doctor Bull 's patient  --  the line lamps lit up together as the receivers were replaced . May pulled the plugs . As soon as Joe 's cold was better , she would get Harry to do it . + A low-hung central chandelier with a bead fringe and six stained glass panels framed in ornate , antique bronze poured light on the bare amber oak of Bates ' dining room table . There were five of them gathered around it , counting Doctor Bull himself . Matthew Herring , susceptible  | to chills , had left his black overcoat on , merely unbuttoning it and sitting back with his long legs crossed . His reflective , intelligent regard appeared fixed on the large framed picture of the Coliseum across the room , but nothing ever trapped him into the inattention of frank boredom . No matter how far away , he would be instantly back with quiet and concise objections to protect the town treasury . He knew all about special meetings . Isaac Quimby , second Selectman , had a cold . His round , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a damp handkerchief . Behind his silverrimmed glasses , his eyes glowered . His irritable misery was , of course , aggravated by the fact that it was his latest enemy , Robert Newell , Third Selectman , who was holding matters up . He was n't , however , sick enough to make him easy to handle  --  that was , anxious for nothing but to agree and get home . George Bull , considering his own sore bandaged thumb , shrugged . He was n't feeling any too happy himself , and it would n't be surprising if he and Isaac had words before the evening was ' over . Isaac was yearning for trouble . Sarcastically , Clarence Upjohn had put his finger on that when Quimby grumbled something about getting on ; time enough to wait for Newell if it came to voting . " Why do n't you just go home ? " Clarence said . " If there 's any voting , we 'll count you against whatever it is . " Quimby and Clarence Upjohn had been intimate friends for twenty years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of officers in the local Grange , but what made it irreparable was actually a piece of Henry Harris ' work . Clarence , recognizing it , had been stung into pointing out that Isaac did n't have a mind of his own ; he  | was simply Henry Harris ' errand boy . There was too much truth in it for Isaac to take the charge calmly ; he had to put himself in the detested position of insisting that Henry Harris ' ideas were his own . At least he could that way avoid admitting that Henry had outmaneuvered him into a practical direction and control of what had once been Quimby 's business . The way Henry always turned up with reason on his side was remarkable . In that case it had been about gasoline . Quimby 's trucks had for years got their gas from the pumps outside Upjohn 's store . Henry , taking a tighter and tighter grip on the business , soon decided to stop that . They used enough gas to put in a tank and private pump of their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was for Isaac to admit that he was doing it because Henry Harris was making him do it . This feud lasted perhaps a year while they cut each other on all public occasions . Howard Upjohn then managed a reconciliation , a formal shaking-hands . Now , each held back the sharper edge of his hostility until the other was no longer present . George Bull had never been able to decide whether it was simply the fine tart flavor of this ruined relationship which Henry liked ; or whether it was actually all part of a long patient scheme to disrupt the Republicans beyond repair . Henry , he realized , had probably been right the other day . The word Republican could n't stretch much farther when it included Banning and the scoffingly named Better Element ; Bates and the Upjohns ; Isaac Quimby and Ordway ; and Robert Newell . No amount of oilpouring by Bates , meek and neutral , could form a film wide enough to keep such an expanse smooth . George Bull  | supposed that he ought to include himself ; he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agitation of relief  --  he could feel the room already charged with ill temper and fear for the outbreak  --  said : " That sounds like Robert , now . Come on in , " he called . Clarence had opened his minute book on the table and put on his glasses . " Well , Newell , " he said , looking up over them , " I hope we have n't kept you waiting . We came as quick as we could . Now let 's give it a name . What is it , Walter ? Special Meeting of Selectmen in Council , Friday , March sixth  --  called by whom ? " " Just put your coat on the chair there , Robert , " Bates said . " Sorry we had to bring you all the way down from North Truro . Why , if the meeting will now come to order ; why , Doc Bull asked me to call you together to discuss a matter of public health . I guess that 's all I know about it . You might as well go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For God 's sake ! " said Newell . He pulled out a chair indignantly , with a sort of expressed contempt for its lightness , holding it , erect and angry . " What 's the idea , Doc ? Why ca n't you wait until tomorrow ? " Newell 's mouth snapped shut under the short-cropped black mustache . The natural belligerent stare of his brown eyes widened . Had a drink or two , George Bull decided . There was a distinctive note of bold , unnecessary hardness about Newell . Although he had been born in Truro , he went West as a boy , spent several years in Idaho . Back with him he brought a probably spurious western air  --  a suggestion of whiskey , of violent horses violently treated , of boots and ropes and whips ( not confirmed , a rumor con-  | cerned the use of one of the whips on his wife ) . He was known to patronize and believed to promote the cockfights secretly held at a village just across the New York state line . As owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quail Pond , beyond North Truro , he was , as New Winton counted things , an economic factor . During the course of the summer he would require supplies for as many as five hundred guests , in transient lots of fifty or sixty  --  girls in knickerbockers and silk stockings ; ' men who wore cheap colored polo shirts with invariable cigars in their mouths . George Bull , summoned professionally from time to time , could testify that those who wanted it got plenty to drink at the Lodge . Now and then , he had reason to believe that couples sharing a cabin were not married to each other . Around the barber shop , Lester Dunn had made it more or less the fashion to call the camp Tail Lake , but Lester 's mind ran along those lines . George Bull , in a somewhat better position to know , did n't believe that any more out of the way went on there than most places . What talk there was could be traced largely to Lester 's imagination and Quimby 's quarrel with Newell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barked out now : " Sit down , young fellow ! We 've wasted plenty of time already . You hear the business first and tell us what you think afterwards . " Newell 's thick lip curled a little under the cropped mustache , but he said merely : " Another county heard from ! All right , Doc . " " This wo n't take long , " , George Bull said . " Doctor Verney has been up from Sansbury this afternoon with me . As some of you know " ? he jerked his head towards  | Bates ? " we 've been taking blood specimens . Thirteen in all . They 're over at Torrington now . In that sense , we have n't a complete confirmation , and wo n't have until tomorrow or the next day ; but Doctor Verney made a culture yesterday , and I do n't think there 's any reasonable doubt about the situation . Probably every one of those tests is going to show the same thing , so we may as well say right now that what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He turned his glance down the table , inspecting them . In the silence Matthew Herring said quietly : " Dear me , Doctor , that 's really terrible ! Are you quite sure ? " Ignoring this , since the others were still staring simply , George Bull raised his voice . " Now , let 's not waste time . Doctor Verney agrees with me that the most sensible immediate measure would be to arrange tomorrow for general inoculations . We ca n't do much about what 's already started , but we can at least try to prevent any spread from established cases . I suppose the inoculations ca n't be made obligatory , but we ought at least to make them free of charge . We 'll have the telephone exchange ring up all numbers and explain . I want every one in town , and particularly the school children  --  everybody who does n't show any febrile symptoms , that is  --  to be ready to take a first injection tomorrow morning . Better do it down at the school . Somebody can get hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday and there wo n't be any classes , but the busses had better collect the children as usual . I hope to have the vaccine here  --  at least enough to start  --  within the next hour or so . If you 'll just vote an appropriation to cover it , that 'll take care of that . Now , we have one other job ? "  | Pausing , he looked at Matthew Herring , who , somewhat to his surprise , simply nodded . He might , after all , have foreseen that . Herring could be pretty stingy with the town money , but he had enough intelligence to ? Isaac Quimby said sharply : " Hold your horses , Doc . There may be some of us who do n't believe much in sticking children full of those bugs at the public expense . Myself , I 've heard it 's a lot of nonsense , anyway . I would n't have any child of mine ? " " I do n't know that I hold with it either , George , " said Clarence Upjohn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I know Howard darn near lost his arm when they were doing it to him for smallpox back in ? " " All right , we 'll vote about that later . You 'll have to do what I say , so I wo n't waste time arguing with you . You 've got one vote , Isaac . I think Newell and Walter Bates have sense enough to back me up , so you can use it any way you like . The other matter is this . I want to find a place we can use for a hospital . It does n't have to be much ; but a certain number of cases ca n't be properly nursed at home . Verney 's afraid that the Sansbury hospital 's too small to spare any nurses , but we can get some from Torrington all right . The Evarts house is the best place I can think of . See if you can get old Jethro to let you use it , Walter . If you ca n't , we 'll just use it anyway . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chair , the light fairly on his pale face , his lips busy with his shaggy mustache ends . " I will , George . " He swallowed , and meekly taking the opening , said , " I suppose you mean then  --  well , that is , I suppose that that 's what Geraldine 's got ? " " Well , I 'm afraid so . I did n't tell you this afternoon  | because I wanted to get it settled here before it was being passed all around town . Sorry if it 's a shock ; but you know the way Emma gabs , I guess . " Isaac Quimby , halted for a moment , said now : " Look here , George , you take a pretty high hand , it appears to me . I 'm not agreeing to any of that needle stuff . Especially I 'm not when you ca n't show me yet any proof that this is more than some idea you and Verney cooked up . Said yourself you would n't know until ? " " Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , try not to show it ! " Robert Newell 's loud and cruel voice leaped negligently at him . " You vote no ; and I vote yes , so we can go home now and let Walter do what he 's told . This does n't seem to concern Truro much , so I have n't any more to say . " He stood up . " Maybe you have n't , " rasped out Quimby , infuriated , " but let me tell you the township of New Winton may have something to say when you try to start up your whorehouse next summer . Maybe you 'll have something to say to the State police . You better start getting it ready ? " " Listen , Grandpa , do n't make me mad . Why , you superannuated little runt , I might forget you had a foot in the grave and knock your face in . You 'd better go home to bed . " " That 's a fine idea , " agreed Clarence . " The rest of us can settle the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , " Matthew Herring said . " I have a few questions I 'd like you to answer , Doctor , before any one goes home . Am I right in believing that there must be a source of infection for an outbreak of this sort ? "  | " You are . " " Has that been located ? " " Yes , by process of deduction . Samples of the water are over at Torrington for bacteriological examination . The typhoid bacillus does n't live long in ordinary water , but there are more robust organisms which indicate pollution satisfactorily . I imagine they 'll find some . If they do n't , we 'll have to look for something else ; but nothing else seems indicated . That reminds me that when Isaac began his objections , I wanted to add that it would be just as well not to drink the water without boiling it . We 'll see that people are warned about that . " " I see . Yes , that would seem wise . You inspect the reservoir pretty regularly , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I keep an eye on it . " " In spite of that , then , the water has been contaminated in some way ? " " In my opinion . " " I see . This must have been a recent thing , then ? " " Well , it 's hard to say . There have been plenty of cases in which the organisms have remained alive all winter , frozen in ice . You ca n't tell . " " I see . By the way , when did you last make an inspec-tion ? " " Why , I really could n't say , Herring . Not for some time . There is n't much to inspect . It 's well fenced and posted . That 's about the most you can do . The Water Board has to look out for the mains and valves . If Eric Cadbury sees anything , I go up and look it over . Nobody 's around there . No reason to ? " " Yet somebody must have been . Am I correct ? " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a  | person harboring the typhoid bacillus has got into the water , you are . " " How about the construction camp ? That 's in that general direction , is n't it ? " " It 's quite a way back . I do n't think it could have any connection , as far as the camp itself is concerned . Some of the men might go wandering around . " " Well , come on , come on , " said Robert Newell . " Grandpa and I want to get home . " " One more question , Doctor . Did you ever inspect the camp ? I mean , are you in a position to say definitely that there could be no connection ? " " You heard me say it , Herring . " " You have n't answered my question , Doctor . " " Hm , " grunted Clarence , " are n't you supposed , as Board of Health , to sort of check up on that , George ? " " I do n't know that I am . They got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'll go up some time and see that he has it cleaned up , if it needs it . We generally give them a little time . As a matter of fact , I guess you 're Tree Warden , Newell . Seems to me it might come under the head of fire prevention  --  I mean , getting the buildings out of there . " " Well , I do n't see it that way , Doc . " " Then , in fact , " said Matthew Herring , studying the Coliseum , " you never did at any time inspect the camp or its sanitary arrangements , Doctor ? " " That 's right , I never did . " " Suppose , then , we inspect it tomorrow ? " " Who is we ? " " You and I. Walter if he cares to come . Perhaps Eric Cadbury , on behalf of the Water Board . "  | " I wo n't have any time tomdrrow . " " Perhaps Walter and I could look at it . Or would you rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , Matthew , " Walter Bates said , " why could n't we wait until Doc Bull could go ? " " Yes . Why the pressing hurry , Herring ? " " I 've got this to say ? " Quimby had got to his feet . " It appears to me that there may be some responsibility here . Would n't be surprised if Herring were trying to get at that . You were in hurry enough yourself , Doc , about all this injection business . I 'm not going to sit around here tonight , but maybe we 'd better find out just why , if it 's true , Doc Bull did n't bother to do any of these things . " " You 're kind of out of temper , Isaac , " suggested Clarence . " I do n't think Matthew meant any such thing . Nobody but yourself seems to suit you tonight ? " Matthew Herring looked back from the Coliseum . His drawn , sober face was still composed , and he spoke evenly , without emphasis . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of you do n't seem to have grasped the situation . I think Doctor Bull will agree that typhoid fever in epidemic proportions is a disaster of the first magnitude . He wo n't question my right to want a complete explanation . If there is any blame to be assigned , we must assign it . Public health may need more attention than we have been giving it . " " Than you have been giving it is right ! " George Bull said . " You do n't give it any . When something like this happens , you go yowling for help and who 's to blame . Herring , you 're at liberty to investigate what you please , when you want to . All we need from you is your signature  | on the authorizations for expenses . I hope you wo n't impede matters any more than you can help . " + Doctor Verney said : " Back again , Mary . " He put his hat , and driving gloves tossed into it , on the table . " Let me take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting room , if you 'll go right up ? " He slipped out of the heavy black fur-lined coat and she took it . " Oh  --  this is Miss Valentine , Mary . She 's going to be the night nurse ? " " Yes , Doctor Verney . How do you do , M'am . " " I 'll want to give you and Edith the first injections before I go . We must be as careful as we can . You do n't object to taking it , do you ? " " No , indeed , sir . We 'll be ready whenever you want . " " Good . We 'll go up , Miss Valentine . Mary , will you ask Larry to get Miss Valentine 's luggage out of the rumble seat ? " Mr. Banning was standing by the fire in the sitting room upstairs and Mrs. Banning arose . " Mrs. Banning , this is Miss Valentine . And Mr. Banning ? " Mrs. Banning said : " I 'm afraid you 've had a terrible trip , Miss Valentine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mrs. Banning . Doctor Verney took care of me . " " Perhaps some coffee after that cold drive . Let me have some sent up ? " " You 're very kind . If it 's no trouble . But ? " " Of course it 's no trouble . " She lifted the round ear-  | piece from the hook beside the small enameled telephone box : " Mary  --  oh , Edith . May we have some coffee , please . " She hung up the ear-piece , turning back . " I 've put Miss Stanley in Guy 's room ? Doctor Verney , how are you going to get on without her ? I feel so guilty about letting you leave her here  --  but I thought I 'd put Miss Valentine in the west room ; it would be fairly quiet and there wo n't be sun in the morning . I 'll show you now . Larry will have your things there . Miss Stanley 's with Virginia . I think that cot has been set up ? " " It has , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit down . I 'll show Miss Valentine her room ? " She remained standing , though , turning again to Doctor Verney , and he said : " Mrs. Banning , I do n't want you to worry . The reason that I want Miss Stanley to be here , and that I was anxious to get Miss Valentine , is simply that it 's mainly a nursing problem and they 're both extremely intelligent . The point is to keep the patient as comfortable as possible and to see that complications do n't get a chance to start ? " The phrasing , he felt was excusable ; but what he meant was , to see that complications , when they started , would not be overlooked or misinterpreted . Mrs. Banning 's expression changed , in a kind of disciplined obedience as she forced her anxiety to yield a little ( " Everything is being done ? " ) ; but her eyes remained on him , half-pleading for a more absolute and of course impossible reassurance . She stood with her remarkable , unconscious light erectness  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a child , when a girl at school ? Do n't slouch ; a young woman 's posture is the real test of her appearance ; Lucile , hold your head up ! Finally it  | succeeded . At forty , it was part of her ; even her disquiet had a reserved , inbred politeness . Her distress of mind expressed itself in hardly perceptible small nervous tremors . A great anguish of anxiety broke her speech into short , distracted sentences , but each one finished and precise . In a sense , pride had her on the accustomed rack . Habit , so patiently formed , gave her no choice but stealing herself against any giving-way , which might be necessary or even permissible for others . As she accepted without question the privileges , she accepted too the exact obligations of being born a New Haven Brooks . Vulgar reliefs were closed to her . Without perfect success , but with all her heart , she held to a tradition , not in the easy right of an established aristocracy , but , if possible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dying Puritan strains . Make the willful body do right ! Make the doubtful heart fear nothing ! Doctor Verney said : " Typhoid fever , properly cared for , is very rarely a grave matter , Mrs. Banning . " Mr. Banning , leaving Miss Valentine , had gone downstairs ; for her luggage had n't yet appeared . Coming from the room shown her , Miss Valentine was walking up the hall when she saw the door at the far end open and a white uniform step out . " Why , Peg ! " Miss Stanley said , " you certainly got here ! " " Three-twenty train from town , by the skin of my teeth . Doctor Verney drove me up from Sansbury . " " Do n't touch me , darling . I 'm all germy . How are you ? " " Fine . I 've got loads to tell you about every one . " She lowered her voice . " Laura , what a lovely house ! " " They 're awfully nice people . You 'll like it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pretty sick , poor kid . She 's got a hundred and four right this minute . You 'll have baths all night , I expect . I just finished one . My dear , she 's so thin you could weep . Ask the doctor to come in when he can , will you ? " Mr. Banning was coming upstairs now . He had one of Miss Valentine 's suitcases in either hand . " There you are , " he said . " Larry seems to be laid up . Everything considered , I think we 'd better have him looked at . " 2 INTO the sunless north light of the Principal 's office Saturday morning broke the dim scurry of running feet on the worn hard earth of the playground as some game went by the windows . Shouts preceded , squeals and protests followed , the occasional muffled thud of a kicked football . " All right , Ingraham , " Doctor Bull called . " Let 's have another batch . Might tell the rest they 'll feel better if they do n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a score of sealed glass ampules on the table , glanced at Miss Kiernan , who was doubtfully moistening a cotton swab with iodine . " How 're you coming , Verney ? " From the next room , Doctor Verney answered : " All right , Doctor . I think we 'll have plenty . I just dropped out one child . She 's running quite a temperature ? " Beyond the other door a fresh line of children , forming in hushed , half-apprehensive silence , stretched a little way down the hall ; all their left arms bare ; their faces indecisive  --  afraid that it was going to hurt ; intimidated by  | the formidable figure of Doctor Bull at the table . By way of relief , some one pushed some one else , produced an exaggerated protest , a few nervous giggles . " You stop that , Marty ! " Miss Kiernan said . " This is n't any time to rough-house . John , is every one here ? " " Except Pete Vogel . He 's sick , Miss Kiernan . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I saw her . " " I know , " some one volunteered . " Her father came for her . Said he ai n't going to let Doc Bull do anything to her . He went to see Mr. Getchell . " " Quiet ! Now , the doctor 's ready for you and I want you to come in one at a time . I 'll put this on your arm . You 'll go to Doctor Bull and get your injection , and out by the other door to Miss Coulthard , who will ? " " I wo n't let anybody stick me . No , sir ! I ? " " Marty Fell ! A big boy like you afraid of a little pin prick ! Why , even little Jane is n't afraid . Are you , Jane ? " " No , Miss Kiernan . I 'm not a bit afraid . " " Teacher 's pet ! " called some one . " All right , Albert . I heard you . We 'll see about that later . " From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hall , voices sounded . " . . . and what 's more , I 'm going to see he do n't . You mistook me , Mr. Getchell . I ai n't got nothing against this inoculation stuff . Need n't think I 'm a fool ? " Mr. Getchell came in sight , his neat dark clothes and carefully cut upright , graying hair given an immediate amazing contrast by Joel Parry shuffling beside him . Joel had on a round wool hat of the sort which could be pulled down in severe weather to cover the ears and neck , leaving  | an oval opening for the face . From under the old mackinaw , dull and stiff with dirt , came the loose , soiled blue legs of a suit of overalls , tucked and buckled into short heavy rubber galoshes . One hand clutched the arm of his tow-headed , now tearful , daughter Bess ; the other rose in incomplete gestures toward Mr. Getchell . " Doc Bull took care of my boy , Joel , " he said . " I 'll see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor Verney , now , can do it , if he wants " Mr. Getchell , observing the line of children , dropped his voice . " Of course , that can be arranged , if you prefer , Mr. Parry ? " " Doc Bull ai n't any doctor , " continued Joel . He raised his voice , for he was more pleased than not to have even this audience . " He do n't know what he 's doing half the time . Never has known . Near as I can hear , the whole thing 's his fault anyway . " Mr. Getchell was trying to hurry him , almost impelled to touch the filthy sleeve of the mackinaw , but Joel was in no hurry . " I see Mr. Herring and Eric Cadbury and Walter Bates up the hill this morning trying to find what he did about that camp place . Huh ! He did nothing . He just gads about with that Board of Health sign in his car , too busy looking for ways to fine honest men money ! Leave his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't do it . Not he ! He ? " Out the door past Miss Kiernan with the iodine bottle and the head of the line of children , Doctor Bull came now , a white coat hanging open from his wide shoulders . " Hello , Joel ! " he said . " Did n't hear you mention me , did I ? " Both Joel and Mr. Getchell stopped , so he came up to  | them . Joel , startled , but not cowed , said , " I reckon you did . " " Maybe I missed some . Want to say it again ? " " Do n't mind if I do . I was just mentioning to Mr. Getchell here how it would be a good thing for this town if you lived somewhere else . You ai n't no doctor for human beings . I got to laugh every time I see that Board of Health sign . Huh ! " " Sure , that 's a laugh for you , " agreed George Bull . " Now , how about a laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He put out his right hand , heedless of the bandaged thumb , and took Joel by the mackinaw collar , twitching him irresistibly about . With his left hand , he caught up the slack in the seat of the overalls . Grunting a little , and redder in the face , yet not seriously disturbed by Joel 's squirms and shouts , he carried him suspended from these two points up the hall . The center door to the playground he kicked open , held it against the automatic closing device with his knee , and tossed Joel out . Waiting , while Joel staggered to his feet , he roared : " I would n't come in again , if I were you . We 're pretty busy here this morning . " Mr. Getchell , stunned by so sudden and successful a resort to the very violence which it was half his work to keep the children from attempting on each other , grew pink ; as though he feared that his charges had caught him in part of his lie about real adult behavior . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most mouths open , made neither move nor sound . To greet Doctor Bull returning was only Bess Parry 's solitary doleful wail . " All right , Getchell , " Doctor Bull said , clasping his  | bandaged right thumb a moment . " That 'll settle that difficulty , I think . Take the child in to Doctor Verney with my compliments . " + The heavy mahogany secretary-desk had been made by Aaron Chapin of East Windsor , in 1774 . On the wall adjoining , a plain small frame enclosed Chapin 's bill , and Jonathan Brooks ' copy of his own stiff letter accompanying payment , but characterizing the charge as excessive . Judge Brooks had no way of knowing that in his **26;204;TOOLONG day Aaron Chapin 's best work would be worth some fifty times the price so unwillingly paid for it . The closed writing flap was decorated with three concave shells , topping the solid embossed blocks of the front . Walter Bates put out a finger , fitted the tip into the delicate fluting of the nearest shell , ran it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing , he jerked his hand away , guilty , looking to see who had observed him . No one had . Biting his mustache , he glanced quickly up and down the packed shelves of books covering the opposite wall . Uncrossing his legs , he crossed them the other way , nodding in unrequested agreement with Matthew Herring , and considered the fire a moment . Finding nothing there , he lifted his eyes to admire the rare color lithograph of Ivanhoe , The Connecticut Whirlwind : Property of Paul Banning , Esq. , furiously pacing past a fading judges ' stand on an age-stained track . " You see , there 's no doubt about it , " Matthew Herring said . " The latrines were placed above this gully . We fol-  | lowed it down for perhaps a quarter of a mile , and , of course , it does empty into one of the brooks feeding the reservoir . " " Of course , " said Eric Cadbury , " I 'll say this . In summer I do n't think it would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came , it simply washed right down . " " Granting that , " said Matthew Herring , " the fact was that Doctor Bull never made any kind of an inspection . He said frankly that he had n't bothered . That seems to me pretty close to criminal negligence . How would it look to the Grand Jury , Eric ? " Eric Cadbury smiled . " You ca n't tell , " he admitted . " I have n't been a Grand juror very long , after all ; but as near as I can see , you can always fix up an indictment if you 're willing to swap . You can usually find something the others want , and just hold out on it until they agree to scratch your back . I 'd be willing to try if you help me make a summary . " Mr. Banning , sitting with his hands clasped , had not spoken at all . Now he shook his head . " I think that any court would and should throw the indictment out , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor Bull . Unless his duty regarding the inspection of the reservoir is defined exactly  --  say , he is to make four inspections. a year , and you can show that he only made three you have n't any case . You can legislate duty , but not supererogation . It all goes to pieces as soon as he says that in his judgment the reservoir did n't need inspecting . " " Well , you know more about law than I do , " Eric Cadbury said . " It depends some on the judge you get . Old Cochrane , now ? " " Exactly . Get Judge Cochrane , and the Supreme Court  | will automatically reverse him . Not two in ten of his rulings are allowed . It would be really funny , if it were n't so scandalous . " " We 'll try , anyway , " Matthew Herring said patiently . " You 're a little too finicky , Herbert . In abating a nuisance , the point is , to abate it . If we can indict him , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , or the higher court reverses it . He 'd have something to worry about at any rate . " " I 'm all against it , " Mr. Banning said . " The people ? some of them  --  who ought to be indicted are sitting right here in this room . Doctor Bull 's negligence may be inexcusable , but it 's our negligence that 's criminal . I do n't think any one here has had much doubt about Doctor Bull 's indifference  --  and , very probably , incompetence ? for the last twenty years . I ca n't see anything but the grossest injustice , after letting it slide so long , in now trying to engineer matters to have his medical license revoked . He 's an old man , now ? " " Well , who said anything about his license ? " demanded Eric Cadbury . " Have n't we a right to protect ourselves and our children ? Mr. Banning , your own daughter is lying sick upstairs . Now , what about it ? " " I have n't forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it would help her , I 'd have more taste for vengeance  --  I think that 's the word , Matthew . As for the other matter , Eric ; you ought to realize that if Doctor Bull is indicted and convicted , he wo n't be allowed to practice medicine either here or anywhere else . That 's what Matthew is planning on , I think . " " It is . Exactly . " Matthew Herring nodded . " The sentiment does n't seem to be very popular today ; but what  | a man sows , let him reap ! I do n't think I 'm vengeful , Herbert . It 's impersonal . I think that I may be allowed to say that . You and Walter here might have personal reasons , but I have n't . I 've watched for years now a general let-down under the guise of mercy , and not casting the first stone . It 's a mistake . It 's doing to others what you hope they will do to you if at any time you decide to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are no duties , no standards , no responsibilities left . I think that we were better off when a man was expected to do right , and people were shocked if he did n't . Today , a man seems to be expected to do wrong ; and it 's considered rather ingenuous to be shocked . " " Well , I do n't know about all that , " Eric Cadbury said , " but it sounds good . It seems to me the case is whether Doc Bull ought to be allowed to get away with taking his salary and not doing his job . I do n't know who expects what , but unless you 're a Tammany Democrat in New York City , I guess you more or less expect to be out of a job if they catch you not doing it in any big way . " " I think you 'll find the ayes have it , Herbert , " Matthew Herring said . " Now , as you say , there 's a good chance that we ca n't successfully indict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . What can we do about persuading the County Health Officer to remove him ? " Eric Cadbury , his eyes puckered up shrewdly , said : " Hold on . That 's the wrong end of the stick . If you want to get at him , you 'd better get at the eighteen hundred a year the School Committee pays him to be Medical Examiner . " " We 'll get at that , " Matthew Herring said . " It so happens that he has a certain support on the School Commit-  | tee . I do n't plan to treat with it , because it would simply boil down to some sort of political deal with the Democrats . As long as Mr. Harris controls the Democratic policies , any decent or honest relationship is obviously impossible . I want to get at it another way . " " Go on , Matthew , " said Mr. Banning . " I 'm not consistent enough to object now . For some reason , I do n't mind cutting half a man 's throat . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What you want , Herbert , " Matthew Herring said , " is not to get blood on your hands , I 'm afraid . I mean , because you do n't like blood , not because you intend to fool anybody . Now , Doctor Lefferts has always tacitly supported Doctor Bull , and he will support him to the last ditch . It 's just a professional matter . Making common cause against the laymen . What we have to look for is the last ditch and continue the discussion there . " " Yes . Lucile made some experiments . She discovered that there was n't a great deal to be done . " " Well , the strength of Doctor Lefferts ' position lies in the fact that a complaint or so carries no weight . You can shrug it off . You imply that every one is perfectly satisfied ? except a few cranks nothing can satisfy . The medical profession understands that . It 's been suffering from a few cranks for centuries . But I think if you could show that every one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in throwing Doctor Bull overboard . Now , Walter ? " Mr. Bates jerked his finger away from the scalloped shell . " I 'm listening , " he said quickly . " What would you think of calling a town meeting , say next Saturday  --  that 's the fourteenth . I want to have sev-  | eral resolutions presented for adoption  --  to the general effect that Doctor Bull has been grossly negligent and incompetent , and is unfit to hold his office . If we could get two or three hundred signatures , and send the resolutions along with a petition signed by all the town officers , to Doctor Lefferts , I think Lefferts would remove him . " " I do n't doubt he would , " Eric Cadbury admitted , " but how about the School Committee ? " " That 's a matter for the Board of Education . The District Superintendent would be within his rights , and I know him well enough to be able to say he would exercise his rights , in objecting to the employment of any unfit person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismissed from a medical office for carelessness and incompetence would certainly come in the class of unfit persons . What the School Committee agreed on or did n't agree on would n't matter . Doctor Bull would simply be removed from the field of discussion . " " Say , that 's pretty neat ! " Eric Cadbury said . " Any objections , Herbert ? " " I have none . " Walter Bates said uneasily , " Yes , but do n't you think maybe we ought to wait until later ? I mean ? " " You mean , " said Mr. Banning , " that Doctor Bull is the only doctor in town . Probably he is better than none , so let 's be sure we have some one else before we annoy him too greatly . I 'm not very happy about this , Matthew . " " The State Health Department would step in if necessary , " Matthew Herring said . " There 's no reason to worry about that . As a matter of fact , I 've spoken to Doctor Verney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to help , at least temporarily ; and he gave  | me the name of a Doctor Moses in Torrington . I did n't explain the situation to him , but it seems that there 'd be no difficulty . I do n't mean to imply that any of this is going to make any one very happy , Herbert . I 'd suggest that you sacrifice your happiness in the common cause . " " You score , " admitted Mr. Banning , smiling briefly . " You are n't planning to go all the way home for luncheon , are you ? Better stay here . I 'm expecting Doctor Verney . He 's been busy helping Doctor Bull with the inoculations . " " Well , we 'll be going , " Eric Cadbury said . " I 'm sure you 're with us , Mr. Banning . " " I ca n't be anywhere else , it seems . Yes , of course . You have my support for what it 's worth . How 's Geraldine today , Walter ? " " She 's pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know what you mean , " he said unexpectedly . " I mean , if it would do any good . It seems kind of late somehow . That 's what takes the heart out of you when you start going for somebody . Well  --  still , something ought to be done , I suppose . I mean , that 's why I think Matthew and Eric are probably right ? " He faltered again . " Well , " he added , turning his hat around , " good-by , then ? " + All Saturday morning it had been getting clearer and clearer that Joe was too sick to be left alone . When he awakened , which was quite early , he seemed so much better , with hardly any fever , that May almost persuaded  | herself that what Joe had was , after all , a cold and nothing more . Perhaps giving him breakfast was a mistake , for twenty minutes after he had eaten what he could , he threw it all up . Instead of then feeling better , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaguely of the heat , made clear and insistently voiced but fantastic references to what appeared to be some sort of game of cards . To see a person thus swiftly and hectically let go the real world and , obviously very sick , take up some passionate and incoherent business in a realm abutting on insanity , would disquiet any one . May , appalled , could guess that this was no cold . With a cold , Joe , bad-tempered and ill , spent most of his time complaining . As long as he could protest , had the heart and energy to kick against his state , there would be , she realized now , nothing much wrong with him . Confronting him here was , or appeared to be , an emergency in which he was not the captious , easy winner . Drowning men do not complain of the great anguish caused by salt water flooding the bronchi . Driven to do something , May did try to get Doctor Bull ; but Doris was telling every one who called that he was at the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doris was keeping a list of calls and during the afternoon some one would get around . For May 's benefit , she added : " Doctor Verney got some Doctor Moses from Torrington to fix it up to drive over and help . They want to stick everybody who is n't sick with this stuff . Honestly , May , I 'm scared to death ; and I 'm not the only one , I can tell you ! Everybody 's going to get it , I think . You can die of it , you know ? " It was no exaggeration . Doris was scared to death . Ap-  | pealing to her to watch Joe for a while would be useless . With so many people sick , and so many more who were probably going to be , there was no one available , even if May could pay . Those who were n't sick themselves , or almost frantic nursing their own relatives , would probably want more than money to expose themselves . Friends could be asked to do favors ; but you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deadly , favors which lasted six hours every afternoon . Only half hearing what Doris was agitatedly chattering on about , May saw that this afternoon at least she would have to try it . Harry Weems would be the only possible hope . She had decided that almost at once , but , even at this difficult moment , she hesitated , for she did n't really know how contagious it was . If Harry refused , she could n't blame him ; it was simply that , after all Harry had done , she hated the idea of crowning her requests with one which he might regard as too much . This , of course , was the major point but it did not exclude another  --  a petty , surely irrelevant and contemptible , small one . If she asked Doris to ring up Harry , Doris , though not present in space , would crowd her in spirit . Doris would not be too alarmed by the situation to find time to enjoy her own ideas about this Harry and May business . Doris had done it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could manage to imply that she knew there was more to it than met eyes less expert than hers . What made Doris think so , beyond the prompt suspicions of a personal sensuality always on some sexual quest , it would be impossible to tell . That something had , something which Doris considered definite and conclusive , could be judged from the abruptness with which she took May  | into her confidence . Doris was anything but indiscreet . The unmistakable implication was that Doris knew that May was now on her side of the fence , and could be trusted to keep her mouth shut . Without asking May for any compensating information , she freely admitted her to secrets of such overwhelming local importance as that she had twice had abortions performed as a result of Robert Newell 's attentions to her . " There 's a man in Waterbury , " she said . " It does n't amount to anything . " She sounded as though she thought that May might have a necessary personal interest in the matter and needed reassurance . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by no means on her side of the fence , and that the relation to Harry could not have been more innocent  --  common sense really ought to show Doris that ; how in Heaven 's name could Harry have found an opportunity to sleep with her ? ? seemed impossible . To say anything , she would first have to admit that she understood what Doris thought . As a result , she never did say anything . Flushing a little , she listened with a tense , wordless revulsion to secrets which she did not want to know , and some of which  --  such as the fact that Mr. Newell paid his attentions indiscriminately both to Doris and Clara  --  really disgusted and outraged her . Shrinking so regularly from this subtle contamination ? not that she meant to blame Doris , or even Mr. Newell ; nor that she presumed to condemn what she knew nothing about . She just did n't know , any more than she seemed to know about social or economic justice ; or God in Heaven ; or people going to church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even worried almost sick about Joe , and  | so distracted that she could scarcely speak , she was able to consider and quail from possible thoughts of Doris 's . " Doris , " she said . " Listen , see if you can get Harry Weems , will you ? I just ca n't leave Joe alone this afternoon . If he could spare an hour ? " Amazed , immediately made penitent , she saw that she might have wronged Doris in her own mind as much as Doris had ever wronged her . Perhaps Doris 's fear had after all somehow purged her ; perhaps the quality of mercy , the openness to human appeal , so much readier always in sinners than in the saints , prompted Doris . She said : " Listen , May . I know you 're in an awful jam . If you can get Harry or some one to watch him while I have lunch , I 'll come back on the switchboard this afternoon . You can just stay home . " The impossibility of saying anything reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeping , and hung up . + Starting awake in bed , George Bull flung out a hand which knocked the receiver of the extension telephone from its hook . Groping , he found it on the bedside table , dragged the telephone over . In the deep darkness , the telephone operator said , " Peters calling you , Doctor Bull ? " It was one of the Clark girls speaking , so it was past midnight . He sought the chain of the lamp and jerked it , getting a shaded flood of painful yellow light . He ran a hand over his eyes , through his mussed , upended hair .
