Like a great prehistoric alligator the City of Chicago suns its giant body along 35 mi. of Lake Michigan 's western shore . From the city 's fanlike tail to the south , from its huge bulbous head to the north and from many a populous suburb is pumped centreward a seldom ceasing stream of traffic , most of which flows into Chicago 's chief north &; south artery , Michigan Avenue . In the heart of the city the stream congests &; clots , to the extreme unhappiness of all motoring Chicagoans . <P> Twenty-eight years ago a group of Chicago 's civic minded citizens , headed by the late Charles Henry Wacker , envisioned a great outer drive system which would relieve this downtown snarl by skirting Michigan Avenue , route the main flow swiftly north &; south along the very edge of the Lake away from the city 's downtown streets . Land was bought , drained , beautified . Sixteen hundred acres of lake shore : were filled in . To the north , Michigan Boulevard was widened into a four-lane local and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a chain of smooth drives converged toward the city . By 1935 the whole vast project , costing an estimated $100,000,000 was completed-except at the city 's most vital point , a scant quarter mile stretch of the old Boulevard across the Chicago River , which still clotted at each change of a traffic light . <P> Last week President Roosevelt , en route east after a triumphal tour of the Northwest , was on hand to dedicate and open for traffic the last connecting link between the new north and south side outer drives . What Franklin Roosevelt , his head filled with international affairs , had to say about the span he said in 29 vague words : " My friends , I am glad to come again to Chicago and especially to have the opportunity of taking part in the dedication of this important project of civic betterment . " <P> What Franklin Roosevelt saw , as he drove in an open car along the pack-jammed waterfront , was part of the 16 mi. highway that shoots north along the sandy shore past the 1933 Fairsite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first right then left and north again to cross the Chicago River and the Ogden Slip with the Tribune Tower looming high on the left , * keeps on to wind around swank Gold Coast 's apartments and the Drake Hotel , then north once more on the express highway of Lake Shore Drive . It was at the Chicago River that President Roosevelt paused to make his speech and it was there that the last important link was last week completed at a cost of $11,500,000 , $2,324,881 of which was contributed by Mr. Roosevelt 's PWA.
