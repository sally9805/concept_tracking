FIVE or six years ago , when the country was n't used to a First Lady who wrote for the newspapers and talked on the radio , some misinformed persons criticized Mrs. Roosevelt because of the money she was making . Her answer was quiet and final : All her earnings went for charitable purposes , and as for those three-thousand-dollar radio checks , every one was paid directly to the American Friends ' Service Committee . At that point a good many people looked up from their morning papers and asked : " What 's the American Friends ' Service Committee ? " It 's true that the Friends ? Quakers to most of us ? avoid publicity . They do n't issue appeals , stage mass-meetings , or hold drives . But the highestpowered relief organization in this tragic world ca n't keep out of the headlines just now , because it is engaged in the biggest piece of rescue work of our generation . Others are giving their money and their prayers at home , in the heartbreaking effort to get the . unwanted people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into any haven that will receive them . But the Quakers are on the scene because , with the English Friends , they are the only outsiders tolerated in Hitler 's Germany . And the biggest part of their task is an attempt to rescue , from a future as black as the grave , some of the 135,000 children who must leave Germany . Why are the Quakers allowed to help these people , when practically no other representatives of the democracies are welcome in Germany ? There are two answers to that question , and the first is a matter of World War history . The Quakers are 32 among the world 's few consistent pacifists . They do n't believe in violence as a means of settling disputes , and they have stuck to this belief through the fires of martyrdom . The Service Committee was started in 1917 , to give Quaker conscientious objectors a chance at civilian relief work . During the war they rebuilt devastated houses in France . As soon as the war was over , they gave a demonstration of good will by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who is himself a Quaker . And during most of the next four years they fed a million and a quarter German children who had been brought to the edge of starvation by the Allied blockade . Doubtless there were well-meaning patriots to whom those hungry children were still " the enemy . " But to Quakers a hungry child is never anything but a hungry child . The German people still rise up and bless their name when that feeding of the children is recalled . And that 's one reason why the Quakers are in Germany today . To get at the second reason you have to know something about their background . These Quakers are a curious people . Among themselves they are known as the Society of Friends . For three hundred years they have called one another " thee " and " thou , " have refused to take an oath or to fight in a war . At the beginning of their history the name " Quaker " was applied in derision , because members of this enthusiastic young sect sometimes trembled with religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the whole world there are only 150,000 Quakers . Why are there so few ? " We never proselytize , " they explain . Besides , Quaker discipline is a bit tough for ordinary sinners . The silence of their meetings is seldom relieved by hymns , by colorful ritual , or by a preacher 's sonorous voice . There is only the awesome silence of the individual soul communing with its Maker . At any of their meetings the force of an inward spiritual experience may lead a Quaker to rise up and testify before his fellows , and this " inner light , " rather than any formulated creed , is the Quakers ' guide to religion . This same inner light determines membership in their ministry , which is bestowed regardless of learning or sex . Consequently . there are no theological schools , although many Quaker colleges , such as Swarthmore and Haverford , enjoy brilliant academic reputations and attract large numbers of non-Quakers every year . The Quaker organization is democratic , consisting of a pyramid of congregations or " meetings , " presided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently it was impossible to join the Society as a whole ; new members were accepted only into individual meetings . But the great work of the Friends ' Service Committee brought requests for membership from people everywhere who were irresistibly drawn by a spiritualized religion expressing itself in good works . And since many of these people did not happen to live near a meeting , provision was made for membership in the Wider Quaker Fellowship . Although the Service Committee is only twenty-two years old , it has had such an enormous influence on modern American Friends that it is almost a case of the tail wagging the dog ; with its growing fame it has broken down insularities and stirred Quakers all over the world into a stronger unity . The prim red-brick meetinghouses of the Quakers and their reputation for frowning on frivolity suggest Puritanism . It is true that originally the Friends were a part of the great spiritual revolt against formalism which produced our Puritans , and until modern times they clung to some of the less genial Puritan traits , even to holding that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never shone in letters either ? but they have made up for it in a philanthropy that goes back to the very foundations  | of their belief . George Fox , the first Quaker , revolted against Calvinistic preachings of hellfire and original sin , and in 1647 he began to teach that God is love and that man , however lowly or misguided , is never without a divine spark in him . His followers went into Massachusetts Colony , but received a cold welcome from Governor Endicott and the authorities . Some were whipped ; some were even hanged . Thereupon they founded the colonies of New Jersey and Pennsylvania , with freedom of conscience for all . In William Penn 's day they were the only Colonists who never fought with the Indians . Believing in man , they have always been on the side of " people of color , " of all who suffer or are oppressed . and in the far-off days before women were people , they championed them , too . Quakers have never been afraid to look the great of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utmost boldness , because they do not ask for themselves . In George Fox 's day Oliver Cromwell said of them with amazement , " There is a people riser : who can not be bought with favors . " William Penn kept his hat on in the presence of Charles II ? since Quakers do not believe in uncovering out of deference to anyone except the Almighty ? and the Merry Monarch enjoyed the novelty of talking to a man who had no axe to grind . THEIR determination to see good in everybody is a great asset to these practical Christians . They can get on with almost anybody ? but occasionally even a Quaker gets angry . For two years a double-headed Quaker relief unit healed the sick and fed the starving on both sides in the Spanish civil war . They prize their reputation for impartiality ? besides , they hoped to go on helping after the war was over . But when , a few months after the war ended , six or seven shiploads of food intended for the children were seized and given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quakers . When a young Service Committee administrator returned home early last summer to announce that the Friends were getting out of Spain , it was one of the few known cases where a Quaker has indulged in public condemnation instead of private remonstrance . It is possible that among the Committee 's workers are some who do not admire Hitler ? but if they have ever said so publicly , they are n't sent to Germany . There is a crude but vigorous slang expression . " shooting off your face , " which is a perfect description of what Quakers do n't do . Their practice is to say nothing and saw wood . And that 's the second reason they are in Germany today . Behind the permission to give aid ? an official sanction , which they received from the highest German authorities ? lies an amazing story . It dates from last November 10 , 11 , and 12 ? those days of wholesale arrests and beatings , of lootings , window smashings , and burnings , that are remembered in Germany as " the days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friends , who had maintained a few peaceful little centers in middle Europe since the end of the child-feeding days , were deluged with calls for help . Their existing set-up was totally inadequate : besides , it was doubtful that help would be allowed . So last December they sent three men abroad to see what could be done . An astonishing trio was sent to confront the masters of modern Germany . There was Rufus M. Jones , a retired Haverford ollege professor of philosophy , who is  | chairman of the Friends ' Service Committee . There was Robert Yarnall , a manu , facturer of power-plant gadgets , who had a wide background of social work . There was George Walton , the headmaster of a boys ' school . While they were on their way over , a stupid newspaper story nearly ruined their mission . It gave the impression that they were going over to set Herr Hitler right on a number of points ? consequently , their " impudence " was denounced in the German press . But in the end no harm was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were tactful but direct . When high officials received them , they explained : " We do not seek to fix blame for the trouble . We ask only to aid the representatives come and go freely through the Reich and give relief . Early this summer I talked to a returned Quaker worker , a small , sweetfaced woman who had been in the Friends ' Vienna center for fourteen years . She worked there all through the summer of 1938 , in the tragic times following the Austrian annexation , and in the fall was brought home suffering from a nervous breakdown . She talked mostly about the children . After almost a year at home , her face still flickered nervously as she told about mothers who had to convoy their own children to and from school to keep other children from stoning them . And later , of course , the schools themselves barred them . Jewish children ca n't get an education , because the public schools are closed to them , and their own schools are n't allowed to teach children past the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doomed to prowl the streets like little outlaws , seeing other children play in parks and playgrounds closed to them . Clarence Pickett , executive secretary of the Friends ' Service Committee , says that in Germany there are at least 100,000 children in these desperate straits . About 40 percent of them are non-Jews ; while in Czechoslovakia , where the number of children needing rescue is put at 35,000 , the non-Jewish proportion is " materially greater . " Enormous numbers of them are from broken homes . Many have seen father or mother , sometimes both , arrested and taken away to a concentration camp , from which no word comes back . Others have been set adrift by the suicide of both parents . A third cause of broken homes is the law permitting the automatic divorce of an " Aryan " German from a " nonAryan . " But most pathetic of all is the willingness of parents , if there are parents , to part with their children . They clung to them until " the days of the broken  | glass . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mothers now implore the Friends , " If you ca n't get us out , at least get the children out . " " These pleas , " said one Quaker , " uttered in terror and amid tears , I have myself heard in scores of cases . " It is not a happy thing to think about . But the Friends have never been afraid of unhappy things . And they are working hard for the Bill that would admit 20,000 of these children into this country over a period of two years . It is n't only for the sake of the 20,000 . Outside the German borders , in Holland , Belgium , Switzerland , and England , six or seven thousand children are waiting in crowded refugee camps ? waiting for something to happen so they can go somewhere . If children were admitted to the United States , they would be moved from these camps . Thus the log jam that still holds in Germany scores of thousands of other children would be broken . When a good work is on the fire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they hustle around behind the scenes , seeing key people and getting things done . They are anything but shy . In fact , the funniest thing about them is their reputation for meekness . Alice Paul , who was among the founders of the National Woman 's Party and generaled the Woman Suffrage Amendment through Congress , is a good modern example . It was Miss Paul who inspired the tribute of an exhausted opponent : " Heaven help you if you get in the way of a determined Quaker . And they 're all determined . " THE American Friends ' Service Committee , for historical reasons , makes its headquarters in William Penn 's City of Brotherly Love . It is a layman 's organization ; but the majority of the Quaker congregations in this country have representatives on the Service Committee , and so strongly do Quakers believe in a spiritualized religion of inspired good works that their relief organization is the most active unit in their Fellowship . The World War was , by their own admission , a great stimulus to their consciences . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . " We know now , " they say , " that if we would build a warless world , we must , in times of peace , prepare for peace . " " A relief job , " one Friend told me , " is not just an end in itself . We believe in spreading the idea of non-violence in all that we do , so we leave the field of earthquakes , floods , and act of God ' disasters to the Red Cross . Our work is to combat the suffering caused by acts of man . " Which means that the Friends , being healthy pacifists , always head for the spot where the fight is fiercest . The Quakers got into Russia during the famine years of the early ' twenties , when the Soviet government was no more disposed to welcome outsiders than the Reich is today . The bare outlines of that experience are enough to make pampered skins crawl . They came down with typhus . They saw cases of cannibalism . But they had their compensation when they drove their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran after the cart with dippers and lapped up the greasy drops that fell from a leaking barrel . In America they chose the industrialwarfare front . They went into the coal fields in 1922 , when large areas of Pennsylvania and West Virginia and Kentucky were sunk in a complex misery of depression and price-cutting and strikes . A sick industry paid starvation wages ; miners struck ; more starvation ensued . Other relief organizations , fearing political implications ; turned their backs . The Friends , fearing nothing , pitched in and fed 750  | miners ' children for a starter . Later , in 1931 , President Hoover asked them to take over the whole problem of unemployedminers ' relief . After that they fed 40,000 children a day . At that time they were in a spot so hot with controversy that other relief agencies were having their soup kitchens blown up and their workers told to clear out of town . Because of changed conditions in the coal industry , there were 200,000 miners , at least , who would never again support themselves by digging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on the land , where they could at least raise food for themselves . Perhaps small , light industries , such as furniture-making , would one day move out to them . On this point , Mrs. Roosevelt and the Quakers saw enthusiastically eye to eye . So in 1933 the government borrowed Clarence Pickett and Homer Morris from the Service Committee , to help run several lifesaving communities of this type under the Subsistence Homesteads Act . Today the Quakers have their own model village of fifty families , called Pencraft , in Fayette County , Pennsylvania . The former miners have no cash ; but the houses go up just the same , because the village has gone back to the good old pioneer custom of swapping labor . A sweater factory will eventually give part-time employment . And that 's the kind of thing the Friends mean when they talk of " removing the causes of violence . " THEY do n't leave the future of their mission to chance . Every summer they take a hundred and sixty or seventy young people from different colleges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work camps in what the Quakers , with decorous understatement , call " problem areas . " " Sore spots " would be another name . One is at Flint , Michigan , in the hot spot of the row between unions and the automobile industry . One is near the docks of San Pedro , Los Angeles ' port , where capital and labor have brawled it out in the past and may do so again . A second California camp is studying the migratory-labor problem of the San Joaquin Valley . There are four more . The boys and girls who study at these camps also build dams , dig drainage ditches , lay out parks . Muscles ache ; but much more painful are the mind aches that come from being flung into the teeth of merciless facts . The Quakers are , in a way , tough masters . They know how easy it is to answer the hard questions of modern life merely by denouncing somebody ? how easy , and how futile . They teach their students to listen to both sides and learn that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settings these boys and girls are sometimes hurled into terrific emotional experiences . The Friends quietly remind them that emotion , though human , saves no lives . What one must do is control one 's feelings and study causes . For only by a patient understanding of the causes of such tragedies , they believe , can the tragedies themselves be avoided in the future .  |
