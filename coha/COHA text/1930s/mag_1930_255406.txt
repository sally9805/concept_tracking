Best test of a good idea is performance ; strongest acknowledgment , imitation . Next month will end a year 's performance by Tower Magazines ( Illustrated Love , Illustrated Detective , Home , New Movie ) , published solely for sale in the F. W. Woolworth Co. chain stores-a strategic play for the concentrated women-shopper circulation ( TIME . Aug. 19 , 1929 ) . Last fortnight saw the appearance of two similar magazines on the counters of S. S. Kresge and S. H. Kress chain stores-testimonials to the idea that a million women who never patronize a newsstand will buy 10 love-fiction , mystery , Hollywood chatter every month in a department store . <P> The so-called " Kresge Books " - Modern Screen Magazine , Modern Love Magazine-are published by a subsidiary of Dell Publishing Co . The first issues , totaling 525,000 copies , were sold out within five days . Next issues , totaling 675,000 , will go on sale Dec. 15 ; thereafter , monthly . <P> Like Tower Magazines Inc. , the Dell Company is emphatic that its magazines " stand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like any other merchandise in Kress and Kresge stores , which do not guarantee their sale . Also like the Woolworth group , the Dell magazines already give promise of gathering bountiful advertising from makers of goods retailed by Kress and Kresge .

" <P> Under the guidance of able , bobbed-haired Publisher Catherine MacNelis , sale of the four Tower magazines climbed from 1,205,052 copies in January to more than 1,432,000 for the November issue . Of the four , New Movie has a circulation of more than 800,000 , claimed to be the largest of any screen magazine in the world . Advertisers take space in all four magazines of a given issue . This practice holds for the Dell magazines also . <P> Giving a reverse twist to the same basic idea , Kroger Grocery &; Baking Co. ( 5,200 stores in the midwest ) approached publishers last year with the proposal : " The average chain grocery is handier to the home than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Alert Editor George Horace Lorimer promptly seized upon the plan for Curtis Publishing Co . Last February , Saturday Evening Post and Ladies ' Home Journal were on sale in a few Kroger stores ; last week in 1,459 ; next month in 350 more . Each magazine is rolled inside a wrapper bearing the Kroger name , and a legend suggesting that most of the advertised food and grocery products are available where the magazine was bought .
