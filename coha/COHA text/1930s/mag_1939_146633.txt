A 300-voiced choir and the Georgia State Girls ' Military Band burst into Praise God From Whom All Blessings Flow . A huge throng of Atlantans , ringing Terminal Station Plaza , cheered and handclapped as a white-haired man , large of frame , square of face , firm of jaw , stepped from the station . Atlanta 's Mayor William Berry Hartsfield , a representative of Georgia 's Governor Eurith Dickinson Rivers , Baptist ministers white and black greeted him-Rev . Dr. George Washington Truett , best-known Baptist in the world .

Last week 50,000 Baptists from 60 rations totally immersed Atlanta 's hotels , boardinghouses , Baptist homes , tourist camps . These were ' " messengers " from far-flung local churches which , never bound by anything Baptist conventions say or do , are the cornerstone of the Baptist faith . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congress was to hear much of the need for Baptist evangelism , for Baptist freedom of worship in a troubled world . The messengers , most of them sober small-town businessman and their sober wives , eschewed Atlanta 's worldly amusements , fraternized with one another and with messengers from overseas . In Atlanta were Baptists from Rumania , from Spain ; fourteen Baptists came from Latvia . The Latvians were all one family : Rev. William Fetler , prison worker , his wife and twelve children , who play together as an orchestra . <P> Baptist Truett , 72 , North Carolina-born , was made a preacher against his will at 19 , when his church " voiced its conviction that God had called George W.

He led off : " As Baptists from around the encircling globe are gathered in the beautiful , forward-looking and nobly hospitable city of Atlanta . . . . " Launching into a lengthy comparison between Baptist and Roman Catholic beliefs , he summed up his own by saying : " The Baptist message is non-sacerdotal , non-sacramentarian and nonecclesiastical . Its teaching is that the one High Priest for sinful humanity has entered into the holy place for all , that the veil is forever rent in twain , that the mercy seat is uncovered and open to all , and that the humblest soul in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may enter with all boldness and cast himself upon Christ .
