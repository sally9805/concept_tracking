txt In a dramatic 4%-hour discussion , leading members of the Senate yesterday vented their pent-up emotions on the war debt situation and heard President Hoover attacked and defended as the alleged Instrumethi of the French default . President Hoover was brought into the discussion unexpectedly by Senator William E. Borah ( R. ) of Idaho , chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee , at the close of the debate , after Senator Hiram Johnson ( R. ) of California had made a general denunciation of the European debt defaulters .

Pierre Laval , French Premier , to Washington , Mr. Hoover was responsible for the French default by conversations which the French ! cadet interpreted as meaning that the United States would revise its war debt claims if France reduced reparations .

Watson ( R. of Indiana , and Senator Joseph T. Robin:A:in ( D. ) of Arkansas , the Democratic floor leader .

A strong distinction between the action of England and France was drawn by Senator David A. Reed ( R. ) of Pennsylvania , who urged that the debt of Great Britain should be reconsidered in the light of its prompt payment . As the debate ended , Senator Kenneth ( D. ) of Tennessee , offered a resolution , which , if adopted , would put Congress on record for being unable to " view with indiffetence and unconcern the act of any nation which violates Its solemn written obligation to the Government of the United States , " and as warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the violation of the tcc ms of any such obligations .
