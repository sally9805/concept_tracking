few minutes later he can be seen behind the Confederate lines , talking to a Confederate general . This general , a benevolent-lookingman with a brown , spade-shaped beard , listens to what the officer says , compressing his lips but gazing obedientlyin the direction in which the fierce interlocutor is pointing . It can be seen from the sweeping motion of the cavalryman 's hand that he is urging an immediate attack all along the line . The General seems to consider the cavalryman 's recommendation , then suddenly and with finality he shakes his head , utteringwords indistinguishable in the roar . The cavalryman nods impatiently as the other speaks , then as if he had heard enough gallops off . The General looks after him , an indulgent smile on his face as if saying that no good will come of such impetuosity ; then resumes his study of the scene before him . While the Confederate soldiers yelled , driving , they thought , everything before them , another Confederate general , Gideon Pillow , studied the same scene through a pair of field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into the swamps of Hickman 's Creek , leaving the road to Nashville  --  the road that meant safety to the beleaguered garrison  --  clear . He saw now , however , that the Union right had recovered from its momentarypanic and was re-forming behind the Illinois troops . This meant a counter-attack within the next half-hour . But there was still a chance , he thought , of withdrawing in safety to Nashville . And this chance depended on the Confederates ' possessing themselves of that part of the Wynn 's Ferry road that lay directly in front of the lines . General Pillow surveyed the scene , looked down hastily at the map which lie held in his hand , and came always to the same conclusion . The Wynn 's Ferry road must be taken . At that moment he caught sight of the discontented colonel of cavalry galloping now toward the center . General Pillow rode out to meet him . As he approached he saw blood dripping from the saddle skirts and at the same time caught sight of the cavalry-P101man 's sleeve which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked in concern . The Colonel shook his head . " Horse got hit but he 's all right . Still going , anyhow . " And he fixed his stern gray eyes impatientlyon the leader . The General rode closer so that his voice might carry to the other 's ear . He pointed out the one obstacle to the advance that he was now convinced must be made : a section of artillery that the Confederate gunners so far had been unable to dislodge . The Colonel 's eyes followed the pointing finger . He studied the hill on which the Federal battery was planted and then his eye ranged down the ravine which sloped away from it . It was up this avenue , exposed to direct fire , every inch of it , that the charge would have to be made . The prospect seemed to daunt even the reckless Colonel . He studied the scene in silence for several minutes . The General looked down . The snow near his own charger 's hooves was reddened with the blood that kept dropping from the Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great drop of blackish blood fell . The General found himself wondering how long a horse could hold up under what was probably a major wound , and as if the dripping blood brought home to him the dangerous passage of time , he spoke , decisively : " Colonel Forrest , it will have to be done . " Colonel Forrest nodded as if he too had just come to the same conclusion . " I 'll try it , " he said . Immediately turning off he drew a part of his command up in an open space , in columns of squadrons . Looking back he saw a regiment of Kentuckians standing idle . Knowing that cavalry might take the guns but could never hold them without infantry support , he sent a courier to ask for the Kentucky colonel 's co-operation . The Kentuckians came on the run . They were given their instructions . The first and second cavalry companies were to deploy to the right and left as they advanced . The Kentuckiansp102were to follow , holding their fire until the decisive moment . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a gallop , the infantrymen following . The gunners on the hill saw the Confederates coming and opened fire . The smoke of battle rolled out and hung over the ravine . The hail of lead rattled in the vines and undergrowth , then fell , melting little holes in the frozen ground . The Confederatesmeanwhile poured up the ravine . Many of the cavalrymenhad already fallen and here and there a horse went down . When this happened its rider kicked his feet free from the stirrups and went forward on foot looking for the next empty saddle . They reached a narrow clearing . The leader , rising in his stirrups , swung his blade high and charged the hill . The cavalrymenfollowed yelling and a hand to hand conflict ensued about the guns which still belched fire as some of the gunners stuck to their posts . The gray infantry line had ascended the hill within fifty yards of the battery without moving their guns from their right shoulders . Fifty men had already dropped from the ranks but they still came on , holding their fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flame . Simultaneously their leader 's voice rang out and they poured a destructive fire into the regimentof infantrymen supporting the stricken battery . In the meantime the hand to hand struggle still went on about the battery . The Yankee gunners fought hard . They dropped in heaps about their guns . The hooves of the artillery horses splashed in the blood of the wounded and slain until , blackened , it froze along the surface of the snow . Forrest 's horse had been shot out from under him . A shell crashing through the horse 's body just behind the rider 's leg had torn the already wounded animal to pieces . The rider , disentanglinghimself , went forward on foot . He was splashed with blood and his overcoat had fifteen bullet holes in it , but he was uninjured . Placing his hand on one of the bloody gun carriages he threw back his head and yelled with triumph . His men yell/ing too gave him back his own name : " Forrest ! Forrest ! " Then still hysterical with joy they ran about over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dead and wounded . It was almost at this moment that the Confederate general , Pillow , decided to abandon the advance on the Wynn 's Ferry road and he gave the order , soon to be relayed to these men drunk with victory , that they were to return to the fort.  | 0N a hillside within the fort a group of soldiers had built their camp fire high and now sat around it in various attitudes of relaxation or exhaustion . These men an hour or so ago had come up the hill dragging the arms they had stripped from the bodies of dead or wounded Federal soldiers . Some of them , too exhausted even to eat , crawled at once into their huts or fell log-like to the ground . The veterans , however , at once set about building fires and frying skillets of hoe cake and sow-belly . Coffee was made and passed around in tin cups . Gradually as the hot coffee did its work excitement and the consciousness of victory triumphed over exhaustion . The men 's eyes brightened . They began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would bring forth . The private soldier never knows where he is going next or why . But there arc times when the issues involved are so clear that the army feels as one man . And this was the case at Donelson . Every soldier in the ranks , down to the greenest recruit , knew that he was fighting to clear a way out of the fort , knew even the goal of the last charge , the Wynn 's Ferry road , and they cheered the cavalrymen on wildly , thinking that now the last barrier to escape was removed . When on the heels of the successfulcharge the order came to return to the fort , which many of them thought they had seen for the last time , they looked at one another in amazement , and some grumbled , asking what all the fighting had been for , anyway . In a few minutes the docility of the trained soldier asserted itself . This new move was regarded as part of the mysterious manoeuvres that had led them to victory . Many men were gladp105to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting , as they confidently expected to start , for Nashville on the morrow . Some of these men now , having warmed and fed themselves , were taking thought of the morrow by conducting on an old army blanket an auction of articles they had accumulated during their stay in the fort . Playing cards , frying pans , minute pieces of wood carving were scattered over a blanket . Presiding over them was a dejected-looking coon which one of the soldiers had caught and tamed . When trade was dull the auctioneer whipped it up by sonorously offering him for sale under the title of the " One and Only Genuwine and G'aranteed Ring Tail Roarer from Lick and Indian Creeks and the Owl Bottoms . " Rives Allard sat with his back propped against a tree , his legs spread wide before him . A rifle that he had taken from a wounded Yankee lay across his knees . He was too weary to move his head to look at it but he allowed his fingers to glide over the stock for the pleasure of the feel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would appear to be sinking to sleep and then he would sit bolt upright , roused by something one of the men had said . In the expansive spirit of the hour a fair-haired , short-set young private had found the courage to dwell on his impressions of this , his first battle : " After we got up over them trenches and started toward them Yankees you know all I could think of was how many of ' em they was . I had a notion that if they 'd known they was that many Yankees they would n't a sent us in there . And then all of a sudden I says to myself , Joe Gowan , you better stop standin ' here and arguin ' with yourself . You better go on there and git to fightin ' or some of them officers 'll come up and shoot you from behind . ' And I looks over and what do I see but Old Bill Shackelfordrunnin ' along beside me . Old Bill Shackelford , and I 'd been runnin ' right ' long with him all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He looked around the group in smilingwonder . " Ai n't it funny the notions a man 'll git in his head ? "  | A lean veteran of Fort Henry smiled grimly . " I was just coming down the hill when that first shell burst . The Old Man was sitting there on his horse and it hit right in front of him . Knocked the gravel up all over him . If he was n't mad . I could hear him cussin ' clear down the hill . ' Damn my if it ai n't goin ' to be hot in there today , ' he says . Old Man , ' I thought , it 's going to be a heap hotter for mine than ' t is for your'n ' , but I kep ' on . " He paused and laughed . " They was one funny thing . As I come down that hill I saw the whites of one man 's eyes . I saw the whites of his eyes and I saw him chewin ' and I says to myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your throat there in a minute . ' I kep ' him in sight and I fetched right up against him . I fixed my bay'net and made a pass at his shoulder . Then I run on and was about to bay'net another when durned if he was n't chewin ' . I thought to myself , This whole Yankee army is still a-eatin ' its breakfast , ' and then I saw ' t was the same feller . He 'd run around behind another feller and come right up in my path . " The group guffawed . " I reckon he 'd had enough of you by that time . Did you git him ? " The speaker shook his head . " I was in such a tight myself by that time I did n't know whether I was gittin ' or bein ' got . " Rives listened , fingering the stock of his rifle . He wished that he could contribute something to the conversation but he could not think of any incident of the day that seemed worth relating . Somebody had complimented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifle , but even that would not make a story . He had seen the barrel glinting and had run over , hoping to secure a good weapon  --  his own had got water soaked in a hard rain marching down from Bowling Green . The Yankee soldier who carried the rifle was not dead but he was dying . Rives could tell that by the rolling of his eyes and the convulsive movement of his hands . The rifle lay half under the man . Rives had to lift his leg to get it out . The dying soldier had raised one hand in a sudden , irascible gesture , his eyes had rested on Rives for a second before they rolled upward . Rives fancied that the manp107had died in that instant , but he could not be sure for he had run on immediately , hailed by a comrade who was unbuckling from a huge , dead corporal a holster belt with two pistols . The corporal lying there , shot apparently through the heart , for only a small , round stain disfigured his new blue tunic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pistols . A full-fleshed , blond man in the prime of life . Rives , as he leaned down across the dead man to help extricate the pistols , had felt regretful that this splendid body would not , like the pistols , be put to some use , but would go to waste there on the field . It seemed to him , listening , that the other men were in possession of some knowledge of which he had only a part , and he thought that if they only went on talking long enough he would know all about the battle . He now felt the greatest curiosity to know the whole of it and he listened with attention to what each one said . Then after a little he realized that one of his legs , from being left in one position too long , had gone to sleep and he got up and walked mechanically up and down outside the circle , still listening . As he walked he became aware of the repetition of a phrase that had evidently been going on for some time at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The speaker was a small , gaunt man with a heavy moustache . He uttered the words in a voice made hoarse by repetition , but his eyes went to the face of every man in the group before he turned away , asking again forlornly : " Anybody here seen Jim Rollow ? " There was a moment 's silence . The tall veteran leaned forward and spat into the fire . " I seen him about sundown . He was headingback to the fort . With some of the boys from the Tenth Alabama . " " And where 's the Tenth Alabama ? " The tall man made a gesture to the right . " Over there somewherebehind that hill . Ask Corporal Wiley . He 'll know . He knows everything . " There was a burst of laughter as the men 's eyes followed thep108gaunt figure . " What 'd you send that pore little feller over there for , Tom ? " one man asked . Tom did not answer until the man had disappeared over the hill . Then he spoke reflectively : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up against a tree with a shot through both legs . " " Well , why did n't you tell him ? What you let him walk his laigs off for ? " The tall man shook his head . " I know that feller , I know that Ira Holt . If I 's to tell him Jim was layin ' out there , for Jim could n't a lasted long after I saw him , why , that feller 'd start right out there after him . He 's little but he 's a jim dandy , full of fire . He 'd go right out there after Jim Rollow and then there 'd be two of ' em . Naw , better just let him go on walkin ' around . " Rives had stood eyeing the speaker . Now as the talk sprang up again about the fire he turned and made off for his hut . There was the forlorn little man in search of his lost comrade , and the victory no longer seemed glorious . The warm , excited , curiousfeeling about the battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He thought dully that there had been a battle and that our arms , we were told , had been victorious . But he wanted only to stretch out , to sink into oblivion . Within a few minutes after entering his hut he was asleep.  | THAT night between one and two o'clock a group of en sat in a room of the house that was being occupiedas the headquarters of the Confederate commander-inchief . The negro servant of the host had made the fire up brightly , had ranged decanter and glasses on the table , and now withdrawing left the room to the council , for the men gathered there were regimental and field officers met to decide the fate of the fort . The commanding general and the two senior brigadiers sat at a table upon which lay a litter of papers and maps . Scattered about the room were various regimental officers , among them one or two surgeons , who kept up a low-voiced conversation . On a stool by the fire , communing evidently with his own thoughts , sat the black-browed colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fighting . The commanding general , John B. Floyd , a handsome , fullbloodedman in the prime of life , sat at the head of the table . He had been delivering now for some minutes a speech to which every man in the room , with the exception of the gray-bearded brigadier , listened respectfully . The enemy , the commanding general said , had received heavy reinforcements during the night and had now returned to the position from which he had been dislodged during the day . He had suspected this for some hours and had confirmed his suspicionsan hour ago . Scouts sent out to reconnoitre reported seeingheavy lines of armed men and camp fires blazing in the very position from which the enemy had that afternoon been driven . There was silence . The gray-bearded brigadier  --  he was anp110older man than Floyd and had about him the unmistakable air of the trained and veteran soldier  --  glanced at his colleague , a handsome , dogged-looking man , as if he expected him to speak . When he did not speak , the gray-bearded brigadier leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not believe that all avenues of escape are closed , General . In fact I have evidence to the contrary . Eh , Colonel Forrest ? " And he turned and smiled kindly at the cavalry colonel who had just returned from a scouting expedition . Colonel Forrest now rose and came slowly toward the table , his eyes fixed on the eyes of the commanding general . " Those are not new camp fires , " he said . " They are old camp fires which the wounded have kindled up to keep from freezing . Men of my command have been over that field as late as nine o'clock and they saw no sign of the enemy . Besides , " he added bluntly , " Grant is no fool . If he was going to reinvest he would have done it earlier . The Yankee right was cut clean to pieces , I tell you . " The gray-bearded man , General Pillow , nodded . " I think , " he said eagerly , " that we should make another attack at dawn , or at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By that time the boats that took the wounded to Clarksville will be back and they can ferry the command to Nashville . " The dogged-looking general , who up to now had taken no part in the discussion , spoke in a flat , dissenting voice : " I can not hold my command half an hour after the attack . " Pillow stirred restlessly in his scat . " Why so , General Buckner ? " " Because I can bring into action only four thousand men and they are demoralized by long exposure and fighting . The enemy can bring any number of fresh troops to the attack . " Buckner spoke in the dogmatical tone that a slow-thinking man often employs when he is uttering an indisputable truth . Pillow eyed Buckner as if he were studying not what he had said but the man himself . " I differ with you , " he said mechanically , " I think you can hold your lines . I think you can , sir . " Buckner looked sullen . " I know my position and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their present condi-tion . " " Then , " said Pillow eagerly , " we must cut our way out . " " If you do , " Buckner returned , " you will be seen by the enemy and followed and cut to pieces . " Colonel Forrest , who had remained standing in the exact position in which he had been when he last spoke , now intervened coolly : " You can withdraw your men under cover of my cavalry . " Buckner , as if he had not heard the cavalryman , turned to the table and with an exaggerated air of patience took a pencil and made on a sheet of paper a dot then drew in front of it a half moon . " You ca n't get out here , " he said and then moving his finger along the line of the half moon : " Your only chance is here and while you are trying to cut your way through that one small avenue they can bring all their forces to bear on your retreat . " The handsome commander , Floyd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong to sacrifice three-fourths of the army to save one-fourth , " he said sententiously . The cavalry colonel stood silently regarding the scene . He was not awed by the presence of his superiors , and though he was an unlettered man he was not overcome by their display of superior knowledge . But as he stood there , one leg advanced toward the table , he was bringing all his faculties to bear on the problem that confronted him . The problem was how to convey to these men a certain knowledge which he had and which they did not seem to possess . He knew , from the temper of his own men , from the temper of the troops as a whole and from certain other signs that he had begun half superstitiously and half practically to look for in every battle he engaged in , that the victory belonged to the Confederates , or rather that victory hung just within their grasp if they would only reach out their hands and claim it . He knew these things , but as his knowledge proceeded partly from some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , he had no way of conveying it to the generals . With an impatient sigh and knitting his brows , he strode for-pII2 ward to the table and laid the tip of his finger on the half-moon that Buckner had traced . " I will cut my way out through any part of this line that you will designate , " he said , " and I will undertake to see that the enemy does not harass your flank or rear while you are retreating . " Buckner gazed straight before him and did not speak . The veteran Pillow 's gray checks flushed at the bold words but the flush died when he saw how the other generals regarded them . The senior brigadier , Floyd , continued as impassively as if the cavalry colonel were not in the room . He said that for reasons peculiar to himself * it was impossible for him to surrender to the Federals . He therefore proposed to turn over the command to his subordinates and leave by boat with the Virginia troops . Pillow , whose reason was always at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change front entirely . He was willingto fight but he could not face the prospect of a Northern prison camp . " It is true , " he said , nodding rapidly . " There are no two men in the Confederacy whom the Yankees would rather have than the General , " and here he bowed to Floyd , " and myself . Will it be proper for me to retire with the commanding general ? " Buckner , who had squared his shoulders as if to receive the burden laid upon them , now smiled dryly , either at the generals ' estimate of their own value or at the willingness with which they shifted responsibility , and said that he thought the two senior generals might properly depart if they left the fort before negotiationswere opened with the enemy . The cavalry colonel was looking from one to the other as if he could not believe his ears . " You mean you are going to surrender the army ? " he asked . Pillow raised his hand in a deprecatory gesture , but Buckner eyed the enraged colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be said , Colonel Forrest , " he intoned icily . The cavalryman advanced until his face , darkly flushed as itp113had been in battle , hung immediately over the General 's . " I did n't come out to surrender , " he cried boldly . " I came out to fight . I promised the parents of my boys that I 'd take care of them , and I 'm not going to have them rot in Yankee prison camps . " Buckner , perhaps with the idea of reprimanding his subordinate , got slowly to his feet , but with a powerful thrust of his foot Forrest sent table , glasses and decanter spinning , then strode from the room . At the door he stopped and looked back . " You can surrender the infantry , " he said , " but you ca n't surrender my cavalry . I 'll take ' em out if it 's the last thing I do . "  | RIVES had been asleep for hours but it seemed to himonly a few minutes before he was awakened . Ned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Get up , get up , quick . There 's something going on . " Rives , with confused ideas of the Yankees having captured the fort in the middle of the night , sat up and drew on his boots , then with fingers trembling from fright and cold he buckled on his pistol belt and , stooping , followed Ned through the door of the hut . The whole valley , lit up by the red embers of camp fires , seemed to be in wildest confusion . Here and there men wrapped in their blankets still lay sleeping the sleep of exhaustion but for the most part every man in camp seemed to be awake . Some to Rives ' startled gaze were packing their equipment . Others sat and stared or caught hold of the first man running past to ask what the bustle was about . As Rives gazed he saw that the confusionhad a center . The noise , the talk , the moving to and fro all came from the head of the valley , and it was there that men 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on . Let 's go see what it 's all about . " They made their way through the crowd , pressing as far up toward the head of the valley as they could . The cause of the confusion was now revealed : a body of mounted and armed men drawn up on a slope of the little hill that faced the valley . Some officers sat their horses a little apart from the mounted troops , seeming to be in consultation . As Rives and Ned came up , one of the officers , a black-haired man on a powerful horse , rode forward and sat looking over the crowd . His appearance was inp115great contrast to that of the sleepy , jaded men before him . He seemed in the dead of night like a man who had just come from a battle . His face was flushed and his cold gray eyes glittered metallically inthe light of the camp fires . He swept his broadbrimmedhat from his head and addressed the men in a great voice that rang out over the valley : " Soldiers , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great outcry . The men surged forward protesting . " Surrender the fort l But we beat . We beat ' em , did n't we ? " and they turned toward one another , muttering angrily . The officer caught the words of some of the men . He rode his horse in among them . You fought bravely , " he cried , " and you won a victory . But they are going to surrender the fort just the same . You know what that means . A Yankee prison camp for you . " There was a dead silence . The men gazed at one another uncertainly . The officer had been looking over the crowd as if to ascertain the effect of his speech and now he waved his hat in the air , so vigorously that his startled horse reared upright and then plunged wildly to and fro . Reigning him in negligently , he repeated the gesture and cried in his bold voice : " The cavalry is going out . How many infantrymen are going with us ? " A yell went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here and there men broke from the crowd and ran wildly toward their bivouacks . In a few minutes some of them could be seen returning , knapsacks strapped on their backs , ready for the march . These men immediately took up their stand with the mounted forces ranged to the left of the leader . Rives felt a hand on his arm . Ned 's face was suddenly thrust before him . " I 'm going out , " Ned said calmly . " No use staying here to be taken prisoner . " " Yes , yes , " Rives muttered and hurried after him back to the hut . They collected their few belongings and then going to the shed got out their horses . The horses , not having been ridden for weeks , were frisky in the keen night air . The soldiers sub- dued them mechanically , threw the saddles on , and galloped back to the hillside where the forces were gathering . Columns were forming as they rode up . Officcrs rode back and forth along the lines giving commands . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cavalry , half infantry , had assembled , cavalry in front , infantry column in the rear . The officer who had made the speech was directing the formation , now uttering a sharp command , now threatening some hesitant man with the flat of his sword . The order to fall in was given . The cavalcade started . The men rode forward , over the slope of the hill and then down a ravine . The lights of the fort were visible for a minute , then another hill rose and blotted them from sight . The column moved slowly ; the troopers could hardly see beyond the horses ' heads . Once the word to halt went down the lines while a subaltern and three men were sent ahead to reconnoitre . They returned . There was a low-voiced consultation and then a rider , the leader , attended by a single other officer , pushed off suddenly into the night . The men waited . There was silence except for the creaking of saddle leather and here and there a low-voiced order from an officer . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to march on was given . They came up over a rise . Suddenly all along the line horses came to a stumbling halt . The soldiers reared back instinctively , then leaned forward , peering . Here and there a laugh rang out as men discovered that they had mistaken the fires that the wounded had kindled to keep from freezing for a bivouac of the enemy . They were now on that portion of the field that had seen the most stubborn fighting of the day . Some men looked with professionalcuriosity at places that they themselves had covered in the dawn advance . Others looked with astonishment at the faces of the dead . The men who had died here lay as they had fallen . Some with drawn faces , on their backs , lay gazing at the sky as if awaiting the approach of day . Others seemed to have been frozen inp117action , one man fallen sidewise against a tree , his body resting awkwardly on a crooked elbow . Another , with compressed mouth , a gaping hole in his head , still seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy , his hands fiercely tight about his musket butt plunging the bayonet up to its hilt in the ground . One of the soldiers of the cavalcade cried out as he passed . " It 's Old Fulton , " he said and then turned to stare back at the terrible and grotesque figure . " Boys , is n't that Old Fulton ? " There was no answer . All along the line men were riding faster . They had come now to a part of the field where there were many wounded . Most of these men seeming to realize that no help could come from the cavalcade , only gazed grimly . Others in the delirium of their wounds dragged themselves forward , painfully , inch by inch , calling hoarsely for water . The men passing only rode faster . Rives rode with his face averted . The procession dipped down into a little glade and came up another rise . On the far side of this a fire , just replenished , crackled brightly . It was attended by a single man . He sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain stiffness in his position . Rives , riding a little out of the way to avoid a hole made by the explosion of a shell , could see that blood stained all one side of the man 's jacket and was matted on his right trouser leg . He noticed too that one of his arms hung unnaturally straight at his side . As Rives approached , the man reached over and dragging up a canteen held it awkwardly to his lips . He repeatedthis manoeuvre several times while the cavalcade was approaching . There was a deliberation , a sureness in all his movements , but the fingers that held the canteen trembled and once he had to set it down . " He 's crawled all the way to the branch for that water , " Rives thought . The man as if arrested by Rives ' scrutiny suddenly looked up over the edge of the canteen . His eyes , enormous in the shadow of his peaked cap , met Rives ' for a moment , then his lids fell . Rives could see the pulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p118From  up ahead had come the order to " Move faster . " Descendinga hill , they came to a swollen stream whose banks were lined with ice . The colonel in command had called for a volunteer to test its depth . When none came forth he himself rode quickly in . When it was seen that the water came no higher than his saddle skirts the command splashed in after him , a rear guard remaining until all had crossed . Rives , as his horse breasted the icy water , thought that it must have been to this stream that the man by the fire had crawled . He did not see how a wounded man could have accomplished the feat , for he would have had to go out on the thick ice a little way before he could get through to water . As he rode on he thought of this man who had expended his last strength getting water and dragging up boughs for his fire . He would bleed to death before morning , his dark glance had said . But there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the way he leaned back against his tree or nursed his failing strength in pickingup the canteen . And there had been a strange lack of curiosity in his gaze , a meditativeness about it as of a man shut in on a winter night . It seemed to Rives now that the wounded soldier gazing , and then letting his lids fall , had turned away much as he had turned away from the wounded men by the other fires . The dark glance had been enigmatic but there had been in it a flicker of the hostility which men look on at unbearablesuffering . It was as if the man dying in the circle of the firelightcould not endure the spectacle of the living , who were only riding toward death . The cavalcade rode on , splashing sometimes through shallow branches , sometimes through backwater deep enough to swim the horses . The gray was lifting . It was possible now to see the road they were travelling . They raised their haggard faces and stared at one another . As they came out of a bridle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clear but subdued in tone . It was opening negotiations for capitulation , the surrender of the fort and 10,271 men.  | ON the second day after the fall of Fort Donelson , citizens of Clarksville  --  all those who had not fled from the town  --  were gathered on their balconies , wharves and private docks along the river front . Every eye was fixed on the same object , a broad ribbon of smoke which hanging low over the river slowly advanced toward the town . The gunboats had been expected hourly for two days , and for two days the whole town had been in a panic . Business had long ago ceased , mills and foundries were closed , railroad rolling stock had all been sent south . Even the wharf boat , The Captain O. M. Davis , had been towed to a place of safety far up the stream . Meanwhile the riverside was black with throngs of runaway negroes , and there was talk of a servile insurrection . Many people , fearing this as much as the approach of the Yankees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ border into Kentucky . The first gunboat arrived and dropped anchor far out in the high water . The crowd watched in silence as the transports began feeling their way in to the bank ; then a faint cry arose as the portholes of one of the gun boats was suddenly opened and a broadside of cannon thrust out . No sound , however , came from the gunboats . In silence the gangplank was laid down and in the same dead silence a group of officers , headed by a thickset , bearded man in a rusty general 's uniform stepped over the gangplank and out onto the square . Far back on the edge of the crowd a voice rose , " Grant ! That 's General Grant ! " There was a loud hiss from somewhere in the vicinity from which the voice came , then people could be seen scurrying top120change their position . The General lifted his black felt hat , which had on it a slightly draggled plume , but his face remained impassive . The soldiers disembarking behind him formed columns of fours and rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , marched through the square and out onto College Street . A murmur ran ahead of them , rose on the heels of the marchingmen . As the columns passed the balconies of the Arlington Hotel , a young girl 's nervous laugh suddenly rang out . " Here they come . Look at the blue-bellied Yankees ! " The officers at the head of the column marched on , looking neither to right nor left , but a private 's grinning face was suddenlyupturned as he passed under the balcony . " I thank you , madam , my belly is as white as yours . " Out on the Red River bridge a fat old man in a tight blue coat and a striped linsey woollen vest and pantaloons sat in a trap , holding the reins over two steaming horses . When a negro came in sight , running down the road at full speed he rose to his feet yelling : " They here yet ? They coming ? " The negro coming on pattering feet shouted that there were thousands of them . Done took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they was going to hang the mayor and all the council . . . . Old Mr. McLean did not wait to hear the rest . He turned his trap around so quickly that the negro had barely time to clamber on in the back , and belaboring the already foaming horses , he set off in a gallop up the Trenton pike . An hour later he drove into the yard at Brackets , shouting " Fount ! Fount ! " Mr. Allard came out on the porch , followed by all the rest of his family . Old Mr. McLean , while he extricated himself from the trap , commanded his servant to go straight to the stable and get the fastest pair of horses  --  this with hardly a side glance at his brother-in-law . While the negro was gone he recited some details of the invasion as he had heard them from the negro . The riverside was swarming with negroes and white rabble.  |p121They  had already looted the great warehouse of thousands of pounds of salt pork and flour and were starting now on the storehousesof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the college . They would be on the warpath tomorrow . Spread over the country like locusts . But he  --  and here a smile trembled on his pendulous lips  --  he was not worried . He had foreseen it . He had arranged . Day before yesterday he had started them driving all his stock up to a little farm he had over the border . His money  --  he patted his broad waist with another secret smile  --  he was taking that along too . He might even go to Canada before he was through with it . Mrs. Allard , as her half-brother was speaking , was pacing up and down the gallery . As she turned and came toward him he got up from the chair in which he had sat down , and groaning , clumsily patted her on her shoulder . " You can come with me in the trap , Charlotte , " he said . " And Fount , " he looked about distractedly , " Fount can bring the rest in the carriage . " Mrs. Allard smiled faintly , put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her eyes were on her husband . Fontaine Allard had sat down in his big split-bottom chair . He was looking out at the road . " I declare , " he said , " people already started running out from town . " Mr. McLean glanced at the road where a motley procession of vehicles could be seen , then looked back at his brother-in-law . " Well , what you going to do ? " he demanded . " You going or ai n't you ? " " I 'm going to sit right here , " Allard said coolly . " If the Yankees want me they 'll know where to find me . " " Charlotte ? " McLean asked . She shook her head . " I could n't leave , Brother John . " The trap was at the door . Old McLean climbed in . As the horses started off he leaned forward and shook his fat fist . " Pair of damn fools , " he yelled , " and always were . Hope the Yankees git you . " Allard watched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't kill my horses , " he said.  | Behind him Lucy 's laugh rang out , infectious , almost gay . She had been standing there , silent as befitted a young person in the presence of her elders , but her vivid imagination had been busy . She saw the town in the panic and confusion which her grand uncle had just described , visualized the river front swarmingwith negroes , the warehouse looted , the houses along Second Street deserted or filled with terror-stricken people . She pictured it all but she got from it not a sense of confusion and terror but a feeling of new , up-springing life . In the twinkling of an eye a change had come over her whole being . She who yesterday had been so sluggish that it was an effort for her to move , to answer a question , now felt capable of concentrating upon anything , everything . This feeling was so strong in her that she felt the necessity to discharge it by physical action . Walking swiftly over to where the others stood looking anxiously into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her grandmother'sarm . " I 'm glad we 're going to stay , " she said . " I 'm glad we 're not going with Uncle John , " and she gave each of them a brilliant smile , not because she had at that moment any concern for their welfare or her own , but because she felt the necessity of scattering some of this abundant life about her as people do when they are very happy or are intensely living.  | THE next morning Mrs. Allard awoke at dawn . Sheay for a few minutes waiting drowsily for certain sounds which would tell her that the servants had assembled and were preparing breakfast . The old cook , Aunt Mimy , as soon as she entered the house was in the habit of going into the dining room and flinging the blinds wide , and Mrs. Allard for many years had wakened to the creaking of the blinds on their hinges . Now as the minutes wore on and this sound did not come she became vaguely uncomfortable . She raised herself up in bed , alarmed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his back , one arm flung up over his head , his brown beard rising and falling with his even breaths . Mrs. Allard put her hand on his shoulder and shook him gently . " Fount , I do n't hear any sounds from the kitchen . " His eyes opened suddenly : he stared not at her but through the window which gave on the lawn . " Yes , " he said . " Yes , I expect so . " " Expect what ? " his wife demanded sharply . He remained silent , lying propped on his elbow , staring out of the window . Mrs. Allard after a moment slipped out of bed , dressed herself and went across the hall . The dining room , still darkened for the night , was deserted . In the kitchen old Winston knelt before the great range laboriouslykindling a fire . He looked over his shoulder as Mrs. Allard came in , murmured a " Mawnin ' , Ole Miss , " and turned back to his work . Mrs. Allard stood still in the doorway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked  | He let the stick of wood he was holding drop to the floor . " She 's gone , " he said . " Dey all gone . To Clarksville . " " To Clarksville ? " she repeated . The old man got to his feet . His wrinkled face was working . He chuckled , on a high , malicious note . " Bre'r John sont you word he still here . And old Sis Dep down in her cabin . She 's taking care of them chillun they left . " He took a step toward his mistress , eyeing her as if accusingly . " What 's goin ' to become of things around here ? " he demanded . " Who gwine do them niggers ' work ? Old John , he cai n't git down his front steps and Sis Dep , she so crippled up with rheumatism folks have to be waitin ' on her . " Mrs. Allard 's face had flushed a painful red , as it might have flushed at an insult or personal rebuff . She looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a visible effort at self-control . " I 'll send Dep and John down their breakfast directly . Now , Winston , you get me some flour and I 'll make some batter cakes for breakfast . Then soon as you get your fire to burning you go down to the spring house and bring up some milk . We can see about the milking after breakfast . " The old man turned quietly to his tasks , his mistress to hers , and by the time the rest of the family was assembled a tolerable breakfast was on the table . Fontaine Allard came in as they sat down , reporting that he had just made the rounds of the quarters . Uncle Winston was correct . Of all the negroes on the place there were left only a dozen children , Old Maum Dep , who acted as nurse for the mothers who worked in the field , and the octagenarian , Uncle John . Even a young mulatto girl , Lissy , who had been bed ridden for years , was gone with the rest . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she exclaimed . " Fount , he 'll die , out in this weather . " Cally , more practical , enquired of her father if any stock were hissing . " Six mules , " he replied , " the best on the place , of course . "  |p125Belle  gave a short laugh . " Catch these lazy Brackets niggers walking ! " There was a little silence . Everybody knew that the Allards were thought to spoil their negroes but nobody had ever before charged Fontaine Allard with it to his face . Belle , herself , as if feeling that she had gone too far , looked down and toyed with something on her plate while Love gave the involuntary laugh with which nervous people sometimes greet a breach of decorum . Lucy glanced angrily at Belle , then kept her eyes fixed steadfastlyon her grandfather 's face . He , too , had glanced down for a moment after Belle spoke as if he could hardly credit what he heard . But now he looked up , fixing Belle with a level glance . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that overworking darkies c week days makes them any more willing to walk on Sundays . As for the mules , I think you will find your cousin , Colonel Miles , has lost as much stock as I have . " Belle kept her eyes on her plate and did not answer . Mrs. Allard began to speak quietly of the tasks that would have to be performed if the stock were not to suffer and after a little everybodyrose from the table . Lucy , being more active and used to out doors , had been assigned the care of the poultry . Getting down her bonnet and shawl and drawing on a pair of woollen mittens , she went out into the yard and entered the poultry runs . The chickens , ducks and turkeys all came crowding around her . When she had filled all the pans with water and buttermilk she crossed the yard to the granary . Opening the door with the great brass key she passed into the compartment where wheat was stored . It had been years since Lucy had been inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come here often to " play in the wheat . " Standing now beside the great bin and scooping out wheat into a tow sack she remembered how they would step on top of the pile and then allow themselves to sink in until they were buried , sometimes to the neck . She recalled the excitement when the mass of grain began to yield under foot and the delicious sensation of the grain rushing up over the bare feet and legs . But though she could recall the sensations and the consequent excitement as distinctly as if it had been yesterday , she could not recapture the mood of that far-off time . It seemed to her strange that even children could have been delighted by so trivial a pastime . She finished filling her sack with grain and dragged it across the yard to the poultry runs . The sack was heavy . Lucy might better have filled it half-full and made several trips , but she found a perverse pleasure in the effort to drag the heavy weight over the ground . It was a relief to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she left the house she had been struggling against a feeling of oppression . As she flung handful after handful of grain to the fowls she went over in her mind the encounter between Belle and her grandfather . When she came out of the house her chief emotion had been distaste for what she consideredBelle 's impertinence to Mr. Allard . But now analyzing what had occurred she realized that that was not what troubled her . Belle , after all , had been guilty only of a slip of the tongue . Whateverher private opinions she would never have aspersed Mr. Allard 's handling of his negroes if she had paused at all to consider . But Mr. Allard 's rejoinder to Belle ! That was what amazed Lucy . IIc had stooped  --  she found herself putting the matter into words  --  he had stooped not only to defend himself to Belle but to strike out against her . " Your cousin , Colonel Miles . " Lucy had known of the relationship  --  it was one of the objections Mr. Allard had had to his son 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember hearing it mentioned before . " Your cousin , Colonel Miles . . . . " lie must have wanted to hurt Belle or he would never have said that . The idea of her grandfather , whom she could not remember to have seen out of temper , being provoked to retaliation like an ordinary mortal filled Lucy with a feeling of desolation such as she had never before experienced . She glanced down at the fat white ducks who were waddling at her feet , and scooping up with their spoon-shaped bills thep127grain she had thrown down for the chickens . These ducks , unlikethe other fowls , were allowed to wander at will over the place and often made a procession across the lawn . Lucy was accustomed to look out on them often from her bedroom and to delight in the dazzling white of their plumage , but now the white feathers seemed cold and unattractive , the black eyes greedy . She flung down the remaining grains of wheat and started toward the stable with the intention of helping her grandfather feed the horses . Halfway there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quarters . The approach to the quarters , leading as it did through an alley of pawlonia trees , was pleasant and the cabins themselves , neatly whitewashed and set about with the broad green leaves of hollyhocks , presented the appearance of a village street . Today , however , the scene was one of extraordinary confusion . The negroes had departed in great haste . It was apparent that they had tried to take some of their belongings with them and then had abandoned the effort as too great . A feather pillow was tossed into a bed of hollyhocks , a rocking chair sat forlornly under a tree , a child 's wagon beside it . Lucy saw something shining at her feet and stooping found a little pocket mirror she had given to one of the maids a few days before , its glass shattered , its pretty , embroidered case fouled by mud . She went on down the street and stopped before the open door of Aunt Mimy 's cabin . The hearth was cold and the room in disorder . Fallen in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rope half-tied around it . Lucy stood looking down at the bed with an astonishment almost childlike . Always before she had seen it , high on its bedstead , the covers , the blue and white patchwork quilt on top , drawn up smoothly , the bolster topped by the huge pillows with their embroidered shams . Her eyes roved about the room which she had known from childhood and in which she had received some of her earliest lessons in order . " Larroes to catch meddlars . You want me smack yo hans ? " She could hear Aunt Mimy now when she or Love , standing beside the high dresser , had reached for two tiny china shepherdesses that always stood there . The shepherd- esses were gone , the drawers of the dresser gaping wide disclosed only folded newspapers . It was hard to believe the dignified , preciseold woman had ever lived in this room . Lucy was lost in a wonder not so much how Aunt Mimy could have left her home but how she could have left it in such undignified haste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumbled mattress , all increased the sadness which was already upon her . As she stepped down from the porch and started toward the stable where her grandfather , she knew , would already be busy with the horses , she thought : Rats desert a sinking ship . She walked down the alley of pawlonias , the wind rustling her skirts , repeatingthe phrase over and finding in it a melancholy satisfaction . And it seemed to her that the negroes , furtive and forever alien race , had got wind of some disaster which as yet was only approaching . " Yes , " she thought , " we are sinking , sinking ; and they know it and have deserted us. "  | LU C Y was out on the little brick porch washing themorning milk vessels . The weather had changed overnight and the air had the balminess of summer . No green could be seen anywhere in the landscape but in the woods beyond the stable lot the Judas tree was already flowering . Lucy , as she worked , raised her eyes now and then to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her stern young face softened . The " red-bud " was the first harbinger of spring , eagerly awaited , and to see the black boughs clouded with its pink gave her some of the old stirring of delight . She had finished drying the rows of bright vessels and was about to go back into the kitchen when a noise in the shrubbery made her aware that she was not  --  had not been for some minutes  --  alone . Lucy 's first impulse was to run into the house but she resisted it and stood still , her hands clenched at her sides . " Who 's there ? " she called sharply . There was a faint giggle and a young negro girl came out from the syringa bushes and stood with her hands wrapped in her apron . Lucy recognized her as Julia , granddaughter to the old cook , Mimy . In her first quick glance she noted that the girl 's eyes were deeply ringed with fatigue and that her linsey woollen frock was sodden and crumpled as if she had slept in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling shyly . After a minute Lucy caught up her cup towel and hung it on one of the boughs of the pine tree . " Well , Julia , " she said , " what is it ? " The girl , encouraged , came out from behind the shrubbery . Withdrawing her hand from her apron she held out a little pasteboardbox . " Mama say ask Ole Miss to send her some quinine . Robert T. , he got bad chills. "  | Robert T. , Julia 's little brother , had been born in August . He had been a particularly engaging little creature and Lucy had made him a frilled cap which she thought set off to great advantagehis dark , round little features . A sharp rejoinder sprang to her lips now as she imagined the six months ' old baby dragged about over the river front , exposed doubtless to the inclement weather of the last few days . She repressed it , however , and said dryly : " You 'd better come and see Ole Miss yourself , " and turningled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat knitting in her great chair by the window . She raised her head as the door opened and her glance rested for a moment on the two young women , then she bent her head to her work . " What is it , Julia ? " she asked without looking up again . Julia repeated her request for some quinine . " Robert T. was took bad , right after they got in last night . Maum Dep she come and look at him and she say . . . " Mrs. Allard laid her stocking down . " What time did you get in last night ? " Julia replied that it was before daylight . " Must a been cause war n't no pink showin ' anywhere in the sky . . . . Maum Dep say it 's chills and fevers and ai n't nothin gwine kill urn but quinine . . . " Mrs. Allard 's eyes rested absently on the girl 's face . " He 'll die , " she said coldly , " if he 's having spasms already . He 's too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the tall secretary that stood in the corner . " Julia , how many of you all are back ? " The girl , relieved to be free of her mistress ' scrutiny , was voluble . Was Doc and Trip Butler and old Unc ' Ben . Aunt Mimy had been took bad with rheumatism right after they started home . She and Lissy was laying up now in Mr. Gill 's summer kitchen . Mr. Gill there by the bridge . He said he knew Aunt Mimy was Mister Fount 's cook and he gwine let ' em stay there till some of the Brackets folks could come get ' em . Aunt Mimy say tell Ole Miss to hurry up . Lissy was having them coughing spells and spitting blood and she cai n't do nothin ' with her ... "  |p131Mrs  . Allard stood in front of the secretary filling a small basket with medicines . She turned now and spoke to Lucy : " I 'll tell Uncle Winston to put a mattress in the spring wagon . And he better start right away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Lucy silently stepped out into the hall , closing the door behind her . The hall door was open and the spring sunlight lay in bright squares on the dark floor that was everywhere covered lightly with dust . Lucy stepped over the checkers of sunshine out onto the porch . Half-kneeling on one of the benches that ran on either side of the little gallery she folded her arms and stared off at the distant woods , noting mechanically the tracery of pink red-bud bloom that a few minutes before had given her such pleasure . " They 've come back because they 're sick , " she thought , " all of them sick and now she 'll work herself to death waiting on them . " It seemed to her , inured during the past week to performing household tasks , that she and the rest of the family would be better off without the negroes and it angered her to think of them complacently settling down in their quartersas if they had never gone away . She gazed out on the landscapeunseeing , muttering angrily to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her turn . The negro girl was standing beside her . " Why do n't you go back to the quarters , Julia ? " she asked . The girl gave a soft , deprecatory laugh . " I 'm waiting to carry Ole Miss ' basket . She huntin ' up bandages for Aaron 's little girl what got her head cut . " Lucy folded her arms on the railing and resumed her contemplation of the landscape , but the consciousness of the girl 's presence beside her was disturbing . Half-turning , she said coldly , " Is Aaron 's little girl hurt bad ? I suppose you 're all hurt or sick or you would n't have come home . " The girl who was still under the stress of great excitement seemed to accept this remark as an evidence of sympathy rather than a reprimand . She laughed on a high , excited note . " Miss Lucy , you ought to seen ' em last night ! They was niggers leav- ing town , so fast they like to tore the Red River bridge down gittin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dudley , he got caught twixt the j'ists of that bridge and looked like they was going to trample him to death . " Lucy looked down into the upturned eyes that were as restlessand as shallow as an animal 's . " Uncle Aaron Dudley , " she cried harshly . " A good old man . Nearly ninety years old . And you trample him to death . " " Old man like that did n't have no business out larkin ' ... " The girl broke off , laughing nervously at the expression in Lucy 's face , then shrank away before the upraised hand . " Miss Lucy ! Do n't hit me . I ai n't done nothing . " There was the patter of feet over the veranda floor and a whish of skirts . She had disappeared around one of the columns of the portico . Lucy stood still beside the railing . Her hand was still drawn back as it had been when she moved forward to strike the girl . She watched it sink slowly to her side as if it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house and shut the door . At twelve o'clock Mr. Allard , and Jim , Belle , and Love came back from Babylon where they had ridden that morning to oversee some plantation affairs . They reported that the Trenton road was black with negroes , some moving toward home , some forlornly milling up and down the road . Colonel Miles ' negroes were camped half a mile from his gate , waiting while a white man of the community acted as intermediary between them and their master . Love , taking off her bonnet in the hall , chattered nervously of what she had seen . " The poor things . Lucy , if you saw them you could n't stay mad . You know Uncle John 's old Cider ? He 'd hobbledall the way from town on those crooked legs and when we passed him he was just doubled up in a knot there by the road . He thinks the end of the world has come . When he saw who we were he cried , Marse Fount , I done been down into hell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on that river front . White folks stealing from negroes and negroes stealingp133from white folks and one woman he said had her apron full of salt meat and was trying to eat it raw . After the soldiers got there they fired into the crowd to get them away from the warehouse . They wanted to use it themselves for something . Unc ' Cider said there were people sitting on the kerb who walked twenty miles from up in Kentucky and then had to sit out in the rain all night . . . . " Belle had less to say of what went on on the road and she replied laconically to questions about affairs at Babylon . Yes , they had found everything going on as well as could be expected . The negroes had all run off to town , of course , ' eke everybody else 's , but they were beginning to come back . Joe Green , the overseer , thought they would all be back in a day or two and he hoped to get them to work . She drew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression abstracted and secret . " It might be better , " she said suddenly , " if they did n't come back  --  ever . " When she went upstairs the two girls and Cally followed her . Lucy , awed by Belle 's manner , went over and stood looking out of the window . Cally kept her place by the door . " Well , Belle , " she asked bluntly , " what is it ? " Belle would not speak till the door was closed . " I do n't want Mother Allard to know this . She has enough on her mind already . " She told them then what had been in the minds of everybody they had met on the road that morning . Mrs. Crawley , a widow , lived with her daughter , Flora , on a farm ten miles away in Trigg County . The farm had always been managed by a compotentnegro overseer . There were no white people on the place except Mrs. Crawley and her daughter . At daybreak this morning she had come in a state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Flora had been missing since early afternoon of the day before . Her mother had run all over the fields and through the woods all night , searching for her , and had found her at daylight in an abandoned outhouse not far from the house . She had been kept there , gagged and bound ,  |p134since  the very time she had disappeared , the day before . Yes , it was Albert Jennings . Flora had been able to tell them that . He had escaped but Cousin Edmund and some other men were hunting him , in the Big Pond swamp . Mrs. Spencer was staying with Mrs. Crawley who was worse off than Flora almost , completely out of her head . Cally , while Belle was speaking , had opened her mouth as if to say she did n't believe a word of this story , but at the mention of Edmund Rowan 's name she fell silent , only giving Belle a glance out of shrewd gray eyes before she left the room . Downstairsshe called Lucy and Love into her own room for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a hassock . A foot bath full of hot water stood before her into which she had plunged her feet swollen from too much standing . She spoke plainly and practically , laving her feet the while . This terrible thing that Belle had told of , doubtless it had happened , or Cousin Edmund and those other men would not have gone off to hunt that negro . Some people might think that the mother and daughter , living on that remote place without any other white people , had laid themselves liable to just such a happening . Be that as it may . It had happened . But terrible things were happening every day now  --  men that they knew were being killed in battle or suffering tortures in prison . The chief thing was to keep your head , not to forget the duty that you owed to others . Love and Lucy , if they did not allow themselves to be frightened by idle talk or by brooding on things that had actually happened , could be useful to their grandfather and grandmother , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  soon they would probably all be at home . The problem was to keep them in order . The best way to do that was by disciplining your own thoughts . Love and Lucy must not only never show any fear before the servants , they must actually for the sake of their own safety never have any fear of them . As for Belle , they were all agreed that the best thing was to keep her away from the negroes as much as possible . They must remember , she concluded , that a servile insurrection  --  the girls started and looked at each otherp135at the unfamiliar and frightening words  --  a servile insurrection was like cattle milling . They had heard Cousin Frank tell of such things in the West . Once one got started all followed . The thing was never , even for a moment , to give way to panic yourself . The girls promised they would do as she said and left her sitting in her deep chair , her stout legs in their woollen stockings propped for ease on a hassock , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the quarters most of the day . Toward dusk she came in , reporting that Sally 's baby , in spite of hot fomentations and doses of paregoric , had died an hour ago . It was not chills and fever , but acute indigestion . Sally , moaning , had finally confessed to having riven the little thing some sort of strange meat , two whole sausages of it , during that first night when they had been down on the river front waiting for the Yankee soldiers . The family ate an early supper , then went to sit on the gallery in the air which was as balmy and soft as summer . As they sat there they talked of the events of the day . The routine of work was already partially established . The two able-bodied men who had returned the night before had gone quietly about the tasks of milking , feeding and watering the stock , bringing up grain for poultry , but none of the women so far had reported to the house . " They 're too demoralized , " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sigh . " It 's because they 've had you down there all day waiting on them , Mama , " Cally declared . " When I think of all the work and nursing from that fool trip into Clarksville ! What do you suppose they thought they 'd get ? I asked Unc ' Yellow Ben if he got any of that salt pork they were looting from the warehouseand he laughed and said he left that for the poor white folks . Plenty of meat at home . " " They 're like children , " Mr. Allard said . " There was a circus in town and they had to go . " He spoke in his customary formal and benevolent tones but his voice was weary . He had been up since dawn and had cared for a hundred head of stock during the day . Cally was silent , then burst out again . For some reason Aunt Mimy 's defection seemed to annoy her more than the others . " The rest have all come and taken their medicine , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you , and they stood and took it . They had to . But Madam , " she spoke in high , finickingtones , " she 's too high and mighty to acknowledge she made a fool of herself . Pretends to be sick so we have to send and get her . We have to make the first move . I suppose you sent the carriage , Mama . " " The spring wagon , " Mrs. Allard said wearily . " And I would n't have sent for Mimy by herself but Lissy had to be got home . We could n't leave a consumptive negro there for Mrs. Gill to take care of . " Cally made a little explosive sound of protest and then was silent . The others , weary from the long day 's work , sat quiet , Mr. and Mrs. Allard in the big hickory rockers , and the three young women dropped down on the steps . Lucy was watching the shadows creep slowly over the lawn and thinking that except for the bare branches you could fancy yourself sitting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sibilant , " Shh , " and was aware of Cally 's fingers tightly clutching her arm . Lucy , looking in the direction in which Cally 's head was turned , at first saw nothing . Then she realized that a dark mass had detached itself from the low-hanging cedar boughs and was moving slowly toward the house . The scream died in her throat under the fierce pressure of Cally 's fingers on her arm . The two sat silent watching the dark mass move slowly over the lawn . Then Cally on her feet was whispering : " Get in the house . Quick . We must all get in the house . " The others had risen . In the light from the open doorway their faces were turned upon her in bewilderment . It was at that moment that the moving mass resolved itself into figures thatp137ran , like dogs , over the lawn . As they gained the gallery in one swift bound , Lucy caught the gleam of eyeballs , saw the gaunt faces under the drooping hat brims . She beat on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're white , Aunt Cally ! They 're white ! "  | I N the hall the two young men smiling , weary , clutching their sodden hats , turned from one to the other , trying to answer all the questions at once . Yes , they had come in from Hopkinsville that morning . Ned had thought he knew a shortcutthrough the woods that took off five miles , but they had got lost and wandered for an hour . After that they were afraid to ride , even on by-roads . They had left their horses with an old negro man Ned knew and had made the rest of the way on foot . They had got into the Brackets woods long before dark and had wanted to come to the house then but had been afraid of being seen . They had lain there actually in sight of the house for two hours . It was pretty hard , that time Lucy came out on the porch with an apple and they had to lie there and watch her eat it . Mrs. Allard gave a cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went over and put out the single candle on the hall stand , then looked to sec if the front and back doors were securely fastened . There were no servants in the house now , none had been in it for several days , except old Uncle Winston . Still one must be careful . They tiptoed into the dining room where Rives and Ned , washing down cold ham and biscuits and preserves with hot coffee , told the rest of their story . They had escaped with Colonel Forrest from Fort Donelson , had heard at daybreak shortly after they came out of the fort the sound of the bugle announcing surrender . They had expectedpursuit but there had been none . The first night they had camped twenty miles from the fort and had reached Nashville the next day at ten o'clock . The city was in a panic , the wholep139citizenry demoralized . Government stores were being broken into and pillaged by broad daylight . Wagonloads of material had been carted off into the country for private use . The president of one of the railroads had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his property and had steamed away south . Colonel Forrest  --  " the same officer that came here to see you that night , " Ned said with a flash of his white teeth at his father  --  had been a magnificent sight . The rabble about the public commissary had refused to dispose . Forrest had led his troopers into the plunging crowd , had belabored the more obstinate over their heads and shoulders with the flat of his sabre . A fire engine was brought up and a stream of cold water played upon the mob . Ned , his spirits restored by food and drink , rose from the table and enacted the role of the gallant Colonel directingthe playing of the hose with one hand while , with the other , he made reassuring gestures to a group of ladies who , clad , some of them , only in their nightgowns with shawls over their heads , had suddenly appeared on the street . " We 'll have them out of here in a minute , Madam , the filthy scoundrels , " and Ned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went through the motions of a man playing a hose pipe on the recalcitrant mob . Mrs. Allard had risen and was putting the dishes and food away . " I do n't see that you two boys are in a much better fix now , " she said . " The Yankees were out here the other day and they 'll probably come again . The whole town is in their hands and they 've begun to ravage the country . " Ned replied that , on the contrary , he and Rives considered themselves to be in an excellent situation . They could surely stay hid at Brackets a few days . They had come only because Colonel Forrest on reaching Murfreesboro had been ordered to disband his men . The entire command was disbanded on furloughto reassemble on March 10 . " Only , " he added , " we need new equipment . I 've got to have a fresh horse . And Ma , " he held out his arm from which the sleeve was dropping in rags , " ca n't you do something about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . Rives said he felt like he was pinned on the clothes line . Every time the wind blew it set his rags to flying . " There was a noise in the pantry . Cally got up quickly and went out . In a minute she came back with a grave face . Uncle Winston had just brought the milk and was straining it on the kitchen table . She hoped he had n't heard any talk in the dining room , in fact she was sure he had n't . But he had noticed the light . She had seen him glance toward the door . The question now was what were they going to do ? Mrs. Allard at the first sound of the disturbance had approachedNed and was standing , her hand on his arm . She let it sink slowly to her side now . Her eyes went to her husband 's face . He appeared to ponder for a moment , then he said quietly that Uncle Winston , of course , must know of all their plans . Cally nodded and slipped back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gravely smiling , entered the room . It was decided that the two young men should sleep in one of the small bedrooms in the company wing . There was an outer stairwayleading to the ground from this room . Cally announced that she would occupy the room directly across the hall and would leave her door open . She would keep a good fire going and would sit up all night . " Stand guard , " she put it , striking a military attitude . Uncle Winston who had gone to lay a fire in the bedroom came back reporting that all was ready . As he went out Mr. Allard observed that the old man had volunteered to stand guard too , in the quarters . They had arranged a signal . Uncle Winston if he heard the slightest disturbance ( luring the night was to go out on his porch and call to his hound . With two such intrepid individualsas Cally and Uncle Winston on guard and with the added protection of the set signals , he felt they were reasonably safe against alarms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide what to do . In the meantime the boys must take advantage of a good night 's sleep in a comfortable bed.  | LUCY awoke early the next morning , dressed quicklyand went downstairs . She was about to go into the kitchen to help prepare breakfast as she had been doing now for several days when her grandmother stepped out of her bedroom and stood looking at her significantly , her finger on her lips . Lucy understood the warning gesture to mean that the old cook was back in the kitchen , with perhaps one of the young maids and that her grandmother wished the return to pass unnoticed . She turned back into the main hall . The front door was still closed . Lucy flung it open and going out on the gallery breathed the fresh morning air that was already touched with the odor of spring . The very air seemed fresher and she saw buds on the sugar trees that had not been there yesterday . Lucy , like most people of sanguine temperament , often went through long periods of depressionwhen she seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more terrible because she had been forced to endure the close companionship of Love , to watch her blush when George Rowan 's name was mentioned , to listen while carefully selected passages from his many letters  --  he had been transferred and was in a different regiment from the other boys  --  were read aloud . Sometimes walking alone up and down the garden paths , among the dead , withered stalks of last year 's flowers , she had asked herself why she was so different from Love , so different , she told herself , from all the other girls she knew . She mused on the engagement between Love and George : though they now seemed to love each other , each could just as easily have fallen in love with some one else . " Why am I not like that ? " she asked herself . " Why am I different from all the rest ? Am I going to be like Aunt Lally and end my days dosing out quinine and sewing flannel petticoats for negro women ? " And her aunt 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of terror the dry , kindly voice that to Lucy 's car always seemed to come from a distance . The advent of the two soldiers which ordinarily would have seemed an important happening became even more important viewed in the light of what was going on in her own being . She had been alert all day to execute her grandmother 's orders . Nothing seemed too much trouble , no exertion too great . She flew up and down stairs all day , mended the fire to save Uncle Winston , cut out garments to help her aunt . In the late afternoon the same mood held her as she sat at the sewing machine . She was working on new uniforms for the soldiers . Lally , rising a few minutes ago , had said , frowning , that she did not know whether they would be able to finish the uniforms tonight after all . Lucy , taking the cloth into her own hands , had laughed . " Of course we can . We can sit up all night , if necessary . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work all night , such was the energy that possessed her . Now bending over the machine she pedalled rapidly while her fingers flying in and out of the folds of cloth arranged them before the advancing needle . There was no one in the room now but herself and Rives . Lally and Love were walking in the shrubbery and Ned had got up a few minutes ago saying that he would go downstairs and sit with his father . Before he went he had been singing a camp song , imitating the accents of an Irishmanwho was a favorite in the regiment . Ned was gone but his song still lingered in the air . It seemed to Lucy that the machine ran to its rhythms . As she pedalled she sang , imitating Ned 's rendition of the Irishman 's accent :  |p143When  Johnny comes marching home again . Ta Ra . . . Ta Ra ! , When Johnny comes marching home again Ta Ra ... Ta Ra ... . When she came to the last verse she threw her head back , laughing , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was standing with his back to the fire . She was suddenly aware that for minutes he had been gazing at her as she sewed . She was embarrassed and rose and came to the fire . She was not cold but she found herself bending over and shivering a little . Rives at once went out into the hall to fetch more logs . Lucy sank down in one of the deep armchairs drawn up to the hearth . She watched Rives as he brought the wood in and , kneeling down , skilfully arranged the new back-log in its place . She noticed for the first time his muscular hands and how his broad back strained at the seams of his ragged jacket . It seemed to her that he had actually increased in stature in the few months he had been away . Or perhaps it was that he stood straighter . There was an assurance in his bearing that had not been there before . He had not resumed his own chair but stood , one arm leaning against the mantel . He was looking down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smile . Leaning back in her chair  --  she had not Rives ' capacity for silence  --  Lucy began to talk . She recalled the summer with its pleasures , the summer that seemed so long ago . Did he remember the night of the dance , the night they first met , when that strange man who turned out later to be his own colonel , came ? Did he , perhaps , remember the first time she ever spoke to him ? She did , very well . And did he remember the dance at Music Hall and how they had ridden over in the late afternoon through the woods ? Rives standing beside the mantel smiled assent to her questions , looking at her , then looking away into the flames.  | A feeling , that he was occupied with his own thoughts rather than with what she was saying , came over Lucy so strongly that she fell abruptly silent . He had been gazing into the fire but he looked up as if startled by the cessation of sound . He did not speak for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's almost dark , " he said . " Let 's go out and walk in the garden . " Lucy was about to make some objection . She did not think her grandmother would approve . Some of the servants might see him . He seemed to read her mind , for he shook his head and smiled at her , a smile so sweet and so compelling that she went silently from the room and getting her bonnet and shawl met him on the stairs  |p145UNCLE  WINSTON came in the next morningjust as the family was finishing breakfast and informed his master that the pen in the woods was finished . Fontaine Allard made no comment . Mrs. Allard , glancing at her husband , said that she thought it would be a good plan for the girls to go along and help Uncle Winston drive the horses over into the woods . It had been decided some days ago that they were to be hid in there . It had been decided also that none of the servants except Uncle Winston should know of their hiding place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only two able-bodied negro men who had returned , were sent on errands to a neighboring farm . As soon as they had left the cavalcade started off , Uncle Winston carrying a sack of nubbins , the two older girls each leading a horse and driving one before them while little jenny Morris proudly led the gentle old mare . It was a beautiful day , misty but with a balminess in the air . The woods were still dark except for the pink blossom of redbudhere and there , but the earth under last year 's leaves was moist and steaming . Birds , returned since the last snow , sang from the black boughs . Everywhere there was the feeling of awakening life . The young people walked briskly , with coltlikejumps , intent on discerning every sign of spring . Once Jenny Morris , who had run on ahead , summoned everybody to a low lunging oak bough where a spray of mistletoe rose , starred with white wax-like berries . Lucy held the child up so that she could pluck the mistletoe for herself , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . Jenny Morris rode , holding her clump of mistletoe to her as if it had been a bouquet , bending to lay her face lovingly against it . " It 's the prettiest thing in the woods , is n't it , Cousin Lucy ? " she chanted . Lucy , walking along , one arm over the old mare 's back , looked at the mistletoe . The dark leaves and white berries affected her disagreeably , reminding her of the year just gone and of seasons that had not fulfilled their promise . It seemed to her that the misty black boughs of the trees showed more life than the green and white mistletoe . She pulled a dogwood branch to her and showed Jenny Morris how , though it was still dark , it was swollen at the tip with this year 's leaves . " I 'd rather look at this , " she said , smiling . Uncle Winston , laden down with his sacks of corn , had fallen behind . Love , who had been leading the procession , suddenly stopped still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that bend there , " she said in a low voice . They walked on without saying anything to Uncle Winston . In a few seconds they discerned the figures of two men approaching . Lucy burst out laughing when she saw that it was Rives and Ned . The young men came up laughing . " We sneaked down the back stairs , " Ned explained . " We knew what you were going to do and we thought you might need some help . Expert help , " he added with a sly glance at Uncle Winston . " Well , we better get further on in the woods , " Love said nervously . " We better get these horses where they 're going . Do n't you think so , Uncle Winston ? " Uncle Winston who had been looking from one to the other uncertainly said dryly that that was what Ole Marster sont them over here for and they proceeded along the road . Ned , who had not seen Crevasse since he came back , took her halter from Uncle Winston and fondling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud carriage.  |p147Suddenly  he got up on her back and looked down at Rives , smiling . " Want to race ? " he asked . Rives at once leaped astride the gray horse . " Come on , " he said . The others stood still and , fascinated , watched the two horses , furry in their winter coats , disappear with flying hooves down the narrow road . Jenny Morris in her excitement slid off Dolly 's back . She shrieked and jumped up and down calling shrilly , " Rives ! Rives ! Beat him , Rives ! " Lucy , in the midst of her excitement , could not help but think of the dangers of such a race . " They 'll kill themselves , " she said , " or break that mare 's neck . And what 'll Grandpa say ? " Uncle Winston watched Ned dexterously manoeuvre the mare around a clump of trees . " Naw , he wo n't , " he said . " That boy , Ned , he do n't need no bridle . " He cackled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like us'ns . He uz foaled . I remember . Marster he kept begging Mistis to quit riding old Prince . Mistis say she ai n't gwine do it . Prince just like a rocking chair and ai n't nothingmake her feel better'n a ride every evening . Well , that day she got far as the gate and she turned around and come back mighty quick , I tell you . Marster was standing on the steps . He took one look at her and was hopping mad . My God , Charlotte , ' he say , way you act anybody 'd think you was a mar . I 'm surprised you did n't go on round to the stable to foal : " The old man bent double , cackling , but the girls who had heard this story often before hardly listened , keeping their eyes on the horses . " Rives rides just as good as Ned , " Jenny Morris said . " Look . He 's up with him now . He 's going to beat him . " The two horses had emerged on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more powerfully built than the mare , had been slow in starting but he was gaining on her steadily . Ned , who at first had ridden carelessly , certain of winningthe race , was now bending low , gripping the mare 's barrel with his knees and urging her on to her top speed . The gelding gained a little more . For a moment they were neck and neck.  | Jenny Morris who had constituted herself Rives ' champion had to be restrained from yelling her joy , when suddenly the mare shot forward , almost sending Ned over her head . He recovered himself , rode her two or three hundred yards beyond the beech tree , then turning around with the motion of a jockey turning a horse on a race track he rode the beautiful , foaming animal back toward the others . Sweeping his hat off and sliding to the ground he put his arm about the mare 's neck . " Could n't beat you , ' Old Girl , could he ? " he asked fondly . Rives , coming up , grinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered . Uncle Winston , recalled to a sense of duty , intervened . " Naw , you wo n't . Marster say for us to git these horses in that pen . Somebody going along the road 'll hear all this racket and be in here on you first thing you know . " " That 's right , " Lucy said . " We better go on . " They drove the horses off the main road and made their way through the underbrush to the little clearing where Uncle Winstonhad contrived a pen of white oak saplings . jenny Morris , when she saw the small space the horses were to be confined in , protested : " Uncle Winston , they ca n't hardly turn around in there . " The old man throwing down the nubbins of corn to toll the horses inside frowned at the child . " I reckon you know more about it than I do , Miss , " he said crossly . " These horses mighty lucky to have this good a place to stay . Yankees come yesterday and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ned looked up with interest . " The thieving devils ! " He walked over and laid his arm along Crevasse 's back . " Ladybird ! Well , she wo n't have to stay here long . I 'll be riding her off in a day or two . " Uncle Winston tied the old brood mare , Dolly , to a stout saplingin the center of the pen , fastened his rough but substantial gate , then looked about him with satisfaction . " Wo n't any of ' em try to git out long as Dolly stay , " he said . " Everything on the place follow her . " He turned to Ned , the momentary glow ob/scured by the austerity which was natural to him in addressing young people . " Ned , you better be riding Shanks mar ' back to that house . Ole Miss gwine give you what-for when you git thar . " Ned had dropped down on a log and taking out his knife began whittling a green bough . " Then we better stay out as long as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had never heard the old negro addressed without the prefix of Uncle was pleased with this turn of affairs . She took her place on the log beside Ned . " Yes , " she said , " once you git back to the house , they wo n't let you git out again . " " Get , " Love said mechanically . " What makes you talk that way , child ? " " Hi ! " Rives cried excitedly . " Hi ! " He had seized the knife from Ned and had thrown it at a rabbit which had suddenly emerged from some buckberry bushes a few feet away . The clumsy knife fell short of its aim . The rabbit with a flirt of its white tail disappeared in another clump of bushes . Ned retrieved the knife and stood holding it in his hand . " It ai n't right to throw , " he said . " Do n't turn right in the hand . " He looked up at Rives . " Did you ever hit one that way ? " Rives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time at home . When I was a boy I had a little knife that was just right for it . " Ned shook his head admiringly . " Used to be an old man lived here at Brackets could hit every time . But he was an old settler . They said he , was raised with the Shawnee Indians . " Jenny Morris ' eyes grew large . " Did he live with the Indians ? " " That 's what they said . He was living here in a cabin when old Grandpa Allard came out from Virginia . Made his living hunt-ing . " Lucy had dropped down on the log and was gazing at the ground . " I remember , " she cried suddenly . " Old Mr. Powhatan . I lc slept in the woods . And he was dirty and smelled like snuff . Once Grandma made me take him out a bucket of soup . I remember . He was sitting over there "  --  she gestured to the right  --  " in a little sort of cave . And I gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that was lying by his chair and gave it to me , for Grandma he said . It was a squirrel . And it had blood all down the front . And I did n't see it till I 'd got out of the cave and started home . Ugh ! " and she shivered , yet glanced around at the others with bright eyes , pleased to have recaptured so clearly an incident from the past . " There was another one too , " Ned said meditatively . " Old Cousin Aleck . Used to live in the office . I bet you do n't remember him . " " I do too , " Lucy cried . " He had a long white beard and he said , " Switches for boys and kisses for girls , and he used to swing me ' way up high . " " And he used to take you and Love for walks and always kept a switch to hit at me with if I tried to go along , " Ned said . " Looks like there used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he added reflectively . " That old nigger Uncle Ben , used to ride for Pa . Thought everybody was trying to poison him . " Lucy glanced at Rives and blushed . " He 's seen him , " she told Ned . " Last summer . " " Uncle Winston 's going , " Jenny Morris observed . " He 's going off and leave y'all . " " Let him go ' long , " Lucy said carelessly . " He can take a turn up and down the road and watch and then he wo n't be so nervous . As she spoke she glanced up and saw the chimneys of the house , only partly obscured by the boughs of trees . She looked quickly away . The house , the trees , all the surroundings of Brackets were to her at this moment less real than the scenes she and Ned were calling up from their childhood . Indeed it seemed to her that she had been away from Brackets for a long time and that only here in the woods , which this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling for home . So now , anxious to prolong the spell , she looked away from the tall chimneys and the black trees and leaning toward Ned and smiling , asked : " Do you remember , Mademoiselle ? " Ned burst out laughing and hummed a tune : " Sur le pons , d '  |p151Avignon  . ' She was always trying to make you dance to that and Old Cousin Lydia just for meanness would sing , Ca'line , Ca'line , ca n't you dance the pea-vine ? ' Ned rose and began brushing the shavings of green wood from his trousers . " We better be going along , " he said . " Mall be worrying about us . " " All right , " Lucy said . She rose with the others and walked a little way , then paused involuntarily where a path edged with buckberry bushes diverged from the main road . " Let 's do n't go in yet , " she said . " Let 's go down this a little way . " Ned shook his head . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lucy did not answer . She had run on down the path and stopped now before a great tangle of vines which , using a sapling to climb by , had flung their tendrils to the topmost limbs of a poplar tree . Lucy standing under this natural canopy was exclaimingin delight over the red berries that clustered among the green leaves . " I wish we could get some to put in the blue vases on the mantel , " she cried . " You 'd have to be a monkey to reach them , " Ned said , not advancing further on the path . Lucy , her lip trembling as it often did when she was perplexed or hurt , measured the distance from the ground with her eye . " No , I suppose we ca n't , " she said and was turning away when she saw that Rives was taking off his new jacket and laying it carefully on the ground . He then advanced to the tree and wrapping his legs about the trunk began hoisting himself with the aid of his arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have anything to do with the procedure , had gone on along the road and was now out of sight . Lucy stood still watching Rives . The girl 's eyes sparkled as the sturdy , active young man drew himself skillfully up the tree . At the same time she cried out , as if in alarm . " Do n't , please . You 'll break your neck . " Rives turned his head a little so that he could look down on her . His swarthy face was illuminated by a smile . " Do n't you know I 've got squirrel blood in me ? " he asked and proceeded to crawl along on the limb on which the vines were climbing . The limb was fragile . Lucy cried out again in alarm when she saw it bend perilously under his weight . He managed , however , by swinging himself along it , to reach the place where the berries clustered . The bough cracked and splintered slowly . He hung on until he had torn off a great cluster of the vines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ground . Lucy caught up the cluster and began to arrange it so that she could carry it more easily . Rives , breathing hard from his exertions , was putting on his jacket and buttoning it . He glanced over his shoulder as if to assure himself that the others were still out of sight , then came toward her . His face wore the same determined expression that it had had when he began to climb the tree . He took her hand and then as she made no resistance drew her swiftly to him . They had kissed each other when he became aware that Lucy , her head pressed against his shoulder , was crying . He put his hand under her chin , slowly forced her face upward . Lucy met his eyes , her lips trembling . " Oh , " she cried , " I never thought I 'd be happy again . "  |p153T  W 0 afternoons later Fontaine Allard was sitting n the front gallery , reading , when three squads of Yankee soldiers came into the yard . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lawn and made for the house . Allard shut his book , a finger held in it to mark the place , and stood up . The officer in charge , a heavy-set blond man of forty , had ridden his horse up to the very steps of the porch . " Is this place called Brackets ? " he demanded . Back in the hall there was the rustle of skirts , the sound of a quick , intaken breath . Allard knew that his wife had come up behind him . He knew , too , what was in her mind . The two boys and the two girls had been over in the woods all afternoon , might be coming back now at any minute . He looked down into the officer 's face . " It is , sir , " he said formally . " Can I do anything for you ? " The blue eyes hardened . " We understand there 's three barrels of shot concealed here . " The officer hesitated , compressed his lips . " We 'll have to search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound of quick steps down the stairs . Cally 's voice rang out passionately . " I know who told you that . Those negroes of ours that ran away the other night . " She pushed past her mother and confronted the officer angrily . " You Yankees believe everything niggers tell you , do n't you ? " Fontaine Allard motioned her back peremptorily . His face was crimson but his voice was composed . " There is no shot concealedhere . If it will reassure you I will give you my word to that effect . "  | The officer 's voice was one of strained patience . " Mr. Allard , three of the Confederate generals who escaped from Fort Donelsonwere mounted on your horses . You have a son in the Rebel army . I understand that you have already furnished a considerablenumber of arms to the Confederacy . " He looked past Allard at the women in the doorway . " The complaint comes from two colored men on Colonel Miles ' place , " he said wearily . " Colored men ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place ! " His voice broke ; he laughed harshly . A rough good-humored Irishman pushed his horse forward out of the crowd of mounted men . " That shot ai n't likely to be in the house , Major . More'n likely the out buildings . What say we start there ? " The Major hesitated , then nodded . " All right , Sabin . You take a squad and go around to the back . Lieutenant Lewis . " he turned to a blond boy who could not have been more than eighteen , " you will take the rest of the men and begin the search of the house . Better start upstairs . " Fontaine Allard stood looking at the officer . The red had died out of his face , leaving it a deathly white on which the engorged , thick-spreading veins shone purple . His wife gave a cry of alarm and rushed to him . He looked at her and the expression of his face was such that she recoiled . " Do n't , " she cried . " Oh , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if to push her away , then turned through the hall into the parlor . He walked the length of the long room once , then sat down on a little sofa . Ile sat , leaning the upper part of his body back stiffly . His legs were stretched straight out in front of him , knees unbent . After a little his wife saw that he had picked up a book from the table and was turning its pages . She stood in the doorway between the hall and the parlor . The Major was standing at the foot of the stairs , one arm slung about the newel post . The men , twelve or fifteen of them , were filing past him up the stairs . He called out sharply to one of them as he went by . " See that you do n't do any damage up there , " thenp155turned to Mrs. Allard . " Would you like to go up and watch them , Lady ? " Without answering she started up the steps . Above her she could hear the soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken to pieces . She heard the slats thud on the floor , then the creak of a wardrobe door being flung back on its hinges . There was a shrill , protesting cry from Cally , a laugh from one of the soldiers . " Just carrying out my orders , ma'am . Got to make sure . " More tramping steps , this time out to the upper gallery . The acrid smell of burning feathers rose on the air . Cally looked down wildly from the head of the steps . " They 're throwing the feather beds over the gallery and burning them . Say the shot may be in them . " She turned and flew back into the upper hall . Mrs. Allard stood where she had stopped , with her hand on the stair rail . The woods across the road were framed in the open doorway . Something had moved there for a second , moved beside a tree , then vanished . A gray head or was it just the sun slanting on a moss tree ? Winston ! She remembered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She released a long breath , came back down the stairs . The officer still stood with his hand on the newel post . He was looking straight in front of him but fixedly as if he viewed imaginary rather than actual scenes . She came around the corner of the stairs , took up her position midway between him and the parlor . His eyes came reluctantly away from the green vistas of the wood , met hers . She thought : " I have made him look at me , made him look away ! " Her hand  --  the one farthest from him , clenched in the folds of her skirt . She felt her lips drawing back in a wide grin . " Where are you from , Major ? " " Illinois . " " You are a farmer ? " I le smiled suddenly . His eyes were candid and blue , like a child 's . " My father settled on three hundred acres of Cook ( ; aunty land . It 's rich as cream . They call it Egypt around there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came : " Why did n't you stay  --  on your rich land ? "  |p156He  said stiffly : " I do n't hold with slavery . " In the hall above the soldiers were laughing noisily . One came to the head of the stairwell with an eiderdown quilt in his arms , then fell back before the officer 's hard , upward stare . She said , almost mildly : " I do n't imagine they 'll take anything but what they can stuff in their pockets . . . jewelry . . . money , though I do n't believe there 's any money up there . . . . " A muscle flickered in his cheek but he made no reply . There were rapid steps down the back stairs and then the hall was full of clamor . Cally had rushed in with Jenny Morris clinging to her skirts . " They 've taken all the hay and put it in their wagons and they 're driving the horses out . One of ' em went into Old Beck 's stall . " She wrung her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to death . " Jenny Morris stared up at her mother . Cally returned the gaze . " God , " she reiterated . " I said God . It 's time to call on him . " " God ! " Jenny Morris shrilled . " God , less all call on God , " and she ran and hid her face in her grandmother 's skirts . The Major turned and called up the stair well . " Lewis , are n't you about through up there ? " Then he walked out on to the porch . Mrs. Allard watched the soldiers come down the stairs . Their spurs jingled on the polished boards . One as he came played a tune on the banisters with his sabre , the way a child might have done with a stick . When he came opposite her he gave her a bold stare , then grinned . They hesitated a moment in the hall , then made for the dining room , all except the one who had grinned . He pushed suddenly past her and went out the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive the silver that the others would dump out of the window to him . The young lieutenant , frowning , was on the last step . She turned to him . " Does it interest you to know that your men are in the dining room stealing my silver ? " she asked , then went out on to the porch . The yard was black with negroes . Her first thought was , " But we have n't that many , " and then she recognized a face here andp157there . Half a dozen from Colonel Miles ' place , one or two from Bro ' John 's , Old Unc ' Cripple Dan from Sycamore . . . . She walked to the gallery rail , looked over their heads . There was nobody in sight there on the edge of the woods . Nobody . ... She turned her attention to the scene before her . In the drive three or four wagons were loaded with corn and hay . Soldiers were coming around the corner of the house , leadingor riding half a dozen horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the old blood mare , " Tom " a tricky three-year-old whom nobody had ever been able to break , some young mules . . . . The sergeant who was herding the horses and mules had come up to the edge of the porch . He was perspiring , breathing hard . " Major , they ai n't much here that 's worth taking . " He shook his head . " And they told me this old feller had the best horses of anybody around here . " The Major had taken a note book out of his pocket . Using the railing as a rest he was writing something on pale , ruled , blue paper . He looked at the horses , " Six ? " he asked . " Right , Tom ? " He rapidly noted down a number , then handed the paper to her . She would not take it . She had put her hands behind her . Her eyes were glittering . " Maybe he 's given them all away , " she said , " to the Confederate generals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had a hickory split basket in her arms piled high with objects . The major was not looking at her . He was staring at the roof . " Is that smoke ? " he said . Mrs. Allard watched the thin plume curl along the ceiling , like a feather on a lady 's hat . " The gallery , " she said dully , " they set it on fire when they burned those feather beds . " He was gone into the house , shouting . She ran after him . In the front parlor Fontaine Allard still sat stiffly on the sofa . She ran up to him , shook his arm . " Fount , come . I think the house is on fire . " He rose . In the instant 's glimpse she had of his face she thought that his eyes looked fixed , but he walked obediently into the hall . She looked about her wildly , took up a book from a table , snatched a picture from the wall , then she saw him stand- ing uncertainly in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pressed with him through the throng of negroes and soldiers out into the yard . The Major came out of the house . His hat was off and his face was smudged with smoke . " They 've gone around to the back , " he said , " and started a chain of buckets . I think they 've got it undercontrol , on the gallery , but it 's got into that big room . . . . " He broke off to shout directions to a man who came up with a ladder . " We must start getting things out . From the lower floor , that is . No use fooling with upstairs . " He gestured at the negroes moiling over the lawn . " These blacks here . Have you any you can trust ? " She shook her head , unable to speak because of the tears that had come into her eyes . " Not now , " she whispered . He bent toward her  --  she was ever afterward to remember him as one she had known long and intimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cities . I ca n't control them . Nobody can . Colonel Bruce said . . . . " He broke off , dashed in among the milling men . " Here , you , Crooks , Slayden , take these men . Get everything you can out of the house . " They started up the steps , soldiers and negroes in an indiscriminatemass . Articles of furniture began to appear . A sofa heaved through the tall parlor windows . Grandfather Crenfew'spicture . From the dining room , silver tankards , platters  --  they had n't stolen them after all  --  china tied up in a table cloth and dumped crashing on the ground . The flames had soared up from the back now and were creepingover the front of the house . The heat had grown intense . It was necessary to start dragging some of the things already brought out farther back into the yard . Jenny Morris ran shriekingbeside each piece of furniture as it was moved . A little colored boy from the quarters had appeared and ran beside her . They seemed to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own as it was brought out . Mrs. Allard realized that her husband had moved a little way off . She went and stood beside him . Cally had stopped trying top159save anything and stood with them . A little while ago she had been wringing her hands but she stood quiet now , occasionally calling out the name of some article as the men brought it out . They had stopped bringing things out and all stood watching the burning house . The smoke rolled low so that sometimes they saw nothing , and then licked by the wind a great flame would rise and tower . Mrs. Allard saw one , a fiery mass that seemed to have fingers to tear the house apart . She watched the dividing walls melt away and suddenly saw revealed in the burning mass a rectangle of glowing logs , a cabin , it seemed , burning inside the house . She touched Cally 's arm . " The old house , " she said quietly , " the original old log house . See it burn . " Cally did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the men had taken hold of a marble-topped table and was dragging it farther away from the heat . Fontaine Allard saw him and went forward . He had picked up one end of the table when he turned a bewildered face , said something indistinct that sounded like " My child , " then fell face downward . His wife heard his head strike the marble slab and ran toward him.  | THE house was in ashes when Love and Lucy , acmpaniedby Uncle Winston , stole back by a circuitousway . They had crossed over into the woods at fouro'clock that afternoon , had spent an hour wandering about and were on the edge of the woods , about to cross the road when they heard the sound of hoofs . The two soldiers at once retreated farther into the woods . The girls were afraid of drawing attention to the soldiers if they tried to cross the road , so they lay hidden for a long time in a buckberry thicket a hundred yards from the road . Uncle Winston , walking cautiously up and down , found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were searching the house . The two girls looked at him , trembling . " Are they looking for Ned and Rives ? " Love asked . He shook his head . " They ai n't studying ' bout nothing but plunderin ' as yit , but they might be coming ' cross the road any minute . " He sat down on a stump and reflected . " I 'm going to slip back ' cross the road , " he said finally . " I 'm goin ' to work in ' mongst them soldiers and find out if they 's any danger of ' em crossing the road . And if they is , " he glared at the girls from under drawn , bushy brows , " if they is , I 'm going to raise my voice like we does in meetin ' . I 'm going to sing out Oh , my Lord . Oh , my sweet Saviour ! ' If you gals hears that you git back in the woods as fast as you can and tell them sojers to make tracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " You reckon they 'll come get ' em ? " Love whispered . " Not if you does like I say , " Uncle Winston returned shortly . He got up and began working his circuitous way through thep161bushes . The girls lay hidden in the thicket for a while , then tiring of the confinement got up and paced about in the little glade , listening for sounds from the house . They could hear all the time a confused shouting . Occasionally a single voice would rise above the din . Once Love clutched Lucy 's arm . " That 's Aunt Cally , " she cried excitedly . " I know her voice . Do you suppose they 're doing anything to her ? " Lucy was frowning . " It 's not Aunt Cally , " she said . " It 's some negro . And we 're going to stay here just like Uncle Winston said . " Love stole back some distance into the woods and signalled to the two boys who were waiting at the tree they had appointed as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thicket . At six o'clock the din across the road rose to a babel of sounds . A little later they saw the smoke curling high over the trees and then the great tower of flames . Love had come back up the path . She and Lucy stood there and watched the flames mount higher until finally the whole eastern sky was red . It seemed a long time before Uncle Winston came stumbling back through the bushes . Love ran to meet him . " Uncle Winston , is the house burned down ? Is anybody hurt ? Are the soldiersgone ? " " Hit 's ashes , " he said . He reeled as if he were drunk , then collectedhimself . " Come on , you gals . I got to git back and help my mistress . " The soldiers were gone when they reached the house . The blaze had died down but embers smouldered and now and then the wind would fan them into brief flames . There was a heavy smell of smoke on the air and contending with it and biting into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Winston and the two girls came up they saw two negroes making off across the lawn kicking a wine cask ahead of them . Two or three Federal soldiers stood on guard over the ruined house and two paced up and down in the little alley of crape myrtle that separated the " office " from the main lawn . The family during the last hour had established themselves in this three-room building . Mr. Allard had been carried in on a mattressand lay breathing heavily , still unconscious . Mrs. Allard sat at the head of the bed fanning him and applying cloths that had been steeped in vinegar to his forehead . Jenny Morris had at last gone to sleep . She was afraid to stay by herself so they made her a pallet at the foot of Mr. Allard 's bed . She lay there , her stout little legs and arms sprawled wide . Occasionally she muttered in her sleep . Cally stopping once to lay a hand on her forehead found it burning hot . Nobody had thought to save candles from the burning house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamp from one of the cabins . They kept it burning all night in the room adjoiningMr . Allard 's . The two girls lay in there side by side on the same bed . Lally came in occasionally and lay down on the other bed but for most of the night she sat up , assisting her mother or changing the cold cloths on Jenny Morris ' forehead . The two girls , lying wakeful on the bed , heard the soldiers pacing up and down , the occasional sleepy murmur of their talk . For a while there had been the sound of shouting and singing in the quarters but the guard had quieted the negroes down . About eleven o'clock Uncle Winston came back . They knew that he must have been across the road again , perhaps to take what food he could find to the boys . But they did not dare questionhim even in whispers . Silently they watched him settle down in the doorway of his mistress ' room . He had found an axe somewhere and he held it cradled in his arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The light was finally put out and silence settled on the little house . The smell of vinegar was acrid in the rooms . After a little it was mingled with a heavier smell , the body odor of the negro mixed with sweat . Mrs. Allard sitting motionless at the foot of the bed , absorbed in her thoughts , had not realized that Winston was there until that moment . She raised her head quickly in the dark . Het nostrilswidened . She thought that if she lived through all this , lived to be an old woman , they could never be assailed by a more gratefulodor.  | EdMU ND ROWAN arrived early the next morning . He had seen the blaze rising high over the woods last night , he said , had watched it from his porch . But he had no idea it was the Brackets house burning until a wandering negro brought the news to old Uncle Simms , his body servant . He came over at once , with Uncle Simms and two young negroes who he said he could trust . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked him to take the soldiers away . The sergeant hesitated but his orders had not been definite . He was to stay at the place only as long as there seemed to be any danger from the negroes . The sergeant was from Maryland . He knew , he flattered himself , a thing or two that his major would go to the grave without learning . He looked shrewdly at Rowan : " Them niggers made off with a lot of liquor last night . I ai n't sure they 've drunk it all up . " Edmund Rowan looked hard into the man 's eyes then let his hand stray for a second toward his hip . " I 'm an old widower , " he said good-humoredly . " Nothing to keep me at home . I can stay here and take care of this place long as they need me . " The sergeant nodded , called his men and a few minutes later they rode out of the yard . Cally , standing beside the still smoking ruins of the house , watched them go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frenziedly to bring things into some sort of order . The summer kitchen had escaped the flames . Aunt Mimy was to cook there . The small back room of the office was to be the dining room . A deal table and some kitchen chairs had already been installed theme . Cally was not satisfied with putting the small office domain in order . She put on herp164bonnet and went up to the ruins to see if there were anything she could salvage . Some negroes were wandering about there . They poked the smoking ashes with sticks , laughed childishly when a flame would break out . Sometimes one would pounce on an object , rub the ashes off of it and put it in his pocket . Cally watched them , a bitter look on her face . Finally she called sharply : " Here , Reuben . You , Ed , I want you to help me take these things down to the office , " and she pointed to a trunk that had been thrown over the end of the gallery . Two of them came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field hand , sat down suddenly and gave her a wide drunken smile . " Yes , ma'am , Miss Cally , I be there in a minute . " The fumes of whiskey on the other two made her wrinkle her nose but she marched beside them as with many halts they carriedthe trunk to the office . " Set it down here , " she said sternly , " and begone with you . " She gave her hands a smart slap together in dismissal . That , she told herself , was the way to treat them , the customary manner , only perhaps a little sharper . . . . She crossed the floor , sat down in a kitchen chair and found that her heart was beating like a trip-hammer . Lucy was in the room , moving around uncertainly in the small floor space . In the next room Mr. Allard still lay , not unconscious now , but wandering in his mind . The doctor had said that he might be like that for weeks , or he might have another stroke any day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two rooms and came back to her scat . Lucy paused before the one dresser that had been saved . She looked at the two beds , the small cot , and shook her head . " Love and I over there and you and Jenny Morris in the big bed . . . . I 've figured out a place for everybody to sleep but Cousin Edmund . Where can he sleep , Aunt Cally ? " Cally shook her head . The girl , not looking at her , talked on . " We 'll have to build an addition , I suppose . " The prospect of any activity fired her . She looked up eagerly . " We could do that , could n't we ? An ell , here in the back . " Cally stared at her . As she passed the open doorway of thep165other room she had heard her father 's stertorous breathing , caught a glimpse of her mother 's despairing face . She felt that she hated Lucy for her youth , her eagerness . " How would you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked in a dry , hard voice . Lucy returned her gaze wonderingly . " With logs . You could get logs out of the woods . " Cally stood up . " Yes , " she said and her voice that had been icy was shaking . " And it takes axes to fell trees . You saw those drunken negroes stumbling around on the lawn . You 'd like to arm them all with axes , I suppose , so they could come here and kill us in the night . " Her voice broke . She sank back in her chair , her cupped hands before her face . Lucy came swiftly and knelt beside her . " Aunt Cally , darling . Please . I 'll do everything you say just the way you want it done . . . . Please . . . . " Cally still held her hands in front of her face . Tears trickled down between her fingers . " You do n't know how to do anything and neither does Love . There 's nobody . Nobody but me ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later and rose to bathe her swollen face , she was alone in the room . At supper that night Lucy too was red-eyed and constrained in manner . After supper she took her aunt aside and told her that she and Rives had decided to be married . They were going to ride tonight to Hopkinsville  --  by the back road  --  and would be married in old Dr. Andrews ' study and set out the next morningfor Rives ' home in northern Georgia . Cally flung her arms about the girl 's neck and they cried together . Then Lucy went into the bedroom and gathered up the few garments she could muster for the journey.  | IT was late in the afternoon . Lucy and Rives , now marriedmore than a week , were riding along a sandy road in northern Georgia . Rives suddenly put his tired horse to the gallop . Surmounting a little rise he stood in his stirrups , pointing . " There it is . You can see the house from here . " Lucy looked but could see no break in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the sandy track . He pushed his horse close to hers and slipping his arm around her made her look in the direction in which he pointed . " See ? That black something there over the tallest pine . That 's the house . " Lucy could not see what he was pointing at . " The pines are so dark , " she said . " It makes the woods all look alike , Rives . " " You 'll get used to that , " he said . " It always seems that way to me too after I 've been away for awhile . " They turned off the highway into another sandy winding road . Rives , riding a little ahead of Lucy , called out as he recognizedlandmarks . " Lucy , the mill where we have our corn ground is right down that road . And there 's Fowler 's . Two of the Fowler boys were at Fort Donelson . " He talked on , forgetting fatigue in the excitement of getting home . Lucy rode beside him , turning her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring blindly before her . The house which he had pointed out was a black oblong with one murky light showing , the road to the old mill only a faint track in the gathering gloom . It did not seem possible that people could live in the depths of these pine woods and she had for a moment the fantastic notion that Rives might have taken the wrong road andp167that in a little while they would have to turn back to the main highway . But he had ridden on ahead and was letting down some pasturebars . " It 's not a quarter of a mile now , " he said . " You can see the light from the house . " Lucy saw before her a broad slope of cleared land dotted with the stumps of pine trees . At the farther end of this clearing a paling fence glimmered white and she could make out the outline of a house crowning the hill . The horses , scenting rest and food , increased their pace . The travellers took the slope at a gallop , stopped where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence . Rives swept his hat off and sent forth a loud halloo then helped her to dismount . The baying of hounds had announced their approach . The door of the house opened . Steps clattered on the brick walk . A fourteen-year-oldboy burst through the gate followed by half a dozen hounds . Rives motioned the dogs down with one hand while he embraced the boy , at the same time calling loudly to the dogs . " Down , Rattler , Muse . . . . You scoundrel beasts . " He turned to Lucy . " They remember me , all right . . . . Miles , here 's your new sister . " The boy put out a shy hand , mumbled . " I 'll take the horses , Rives , " he said and slinging the horses ' bridles over his arm went through the side gate to the stable lot . Rives caught Lucy 's arm . " Come on . Let 's get to the fire . " They went up the brick walk which was arched over in several places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light still streaming before them . Lucy had thought that they were approaching a doorway but as they stepped up on the porch she saw to her surprise that the wide hall before them was unroofed and without a door at either end . The light which had guided them came from a door in one of its side walls . In the open doorwaya woman stood . Her head and shoulders were muffled in a shawl . She stood peering out near-sightedly , one thin , veined hand holding the shawl close about her throat . " Rives ! " she cried , not seeming to see him until he was almost upon her.  | Rives caught her to him so roughly that she was suspended for a moment in the embrace . She looked down at Lucy shyly over his shoulder . He set her on her feet . She sprang to the door and shut it hastily . " We do n't leave the front door open now after dark , " she said . She turned to Lucy , " I 'm Sister Mitty . " As she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middleagedwoman as she had at first supposed , but young and slender with light hair strained back from a high forehead and large , clear gray eyes . Little wrinkles radiated from the corners of these eyes when she narrowed them near-sightedly to look closely at anything . " Come up closer . You must be frozen , " she said and laying a timid hand on Lucy 's shoulder moved her nearer to the fire . Lucy , standing in front of a blazing fire of logs , allowed her sodden travelling cloak to fall from her shoulders , drew off her gloves , and slowly raising her hands , unpinned her small hat with the curling ostrich plume . Weary as she was  --  so weary that it seemed to her she could have dropped down on the hearth to sleep  --  her eyes yet mechanically took in some of the details of the room . A huge four-poster bed in one corner , the trundle bed under it , and a tall secretary were the only furnishings except for the circle of chairs about the hearth . Lucy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide oak planks . It was the first time she had ever seen a chamber in gentle people 's houses uncarpeted , unless , she thought with a flicker of amusement , in Music Hall . Mitty had picked Lucy 's hat up and was running her hand over the length of the curling plume . " I expect you brought lots of pretty clothes , " she said with her shy smile . Lucy , remembering the ruin of her wardrobe and all her other possessions , would have spoken but Rives laid his hand suddenly on her shoulder . " We 've ridden all day , Sister , " he said . " Lucy 's tired . You 'd better let her go up to her room . Which is it ? " " The boy 's room . Your old room , " Mitty said eagerly and taking up the lamp led them from the warmth of the bigp169chamber out on to a dark gallery . Before them a flight of stairs led to another storey . At the head of this stairway Mitty paused and flung open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and stooping to pass through the low doorway , preceded the others into the bedroom . Mitty set the lamp on a small center table and went over to make the fire up still higher . Rives took the poker from her and shifted the back log to his own liking . Lucy , remembering that this was the room in which Rives had spent a great part of his boyhood , stood looking about her . The room she thought , was more like a dormitory for boys than a lady 's bedroom . Two big four-posters occupied the west and east corners , a trundle bed visible under each one . The few chairs in the room were scarred as if by generations of heels , and the screen that stood in front of the washstand was so worn that only a few of its original bright colors showed . Some effort , however , had been expended to make the room as attractive as possible . A rag rug woven in soft blues and reds covered a greater part of the floor and antimacassars had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center table Lucy saw a small flowering plant in a little pot and thought that that , as well as the other knick-knacks , must have been brought there by Mitty . " She 's doing everything she can to make me feel at home , " she told herself . Rives was holding the lamp so that Mitty could see her way down the stairs . When her heels sounded on the bare floor of the gallery below he shut the door and coming swiftly across the room set the lamp down on the table . He put both his hands on Lucy 's shoulders and stood looking down into her eyes . She returned his gaze for a moment , then suddenly locked her arms about his neck , pressing her face against his breast . The rough wool of his shirt rasped her face . She could smell the tobacco which he kept loose in the pocket of his shirt . She pressed her face closer , her eyes tightly closed as if to shut out the room . After a little she stirred , drew away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , " she whispered passionately , and clasped her arms about his neck . They stood like this for some seconds when there was the sound of a door opening below stairs , and Miles ' voice called : " Rives , how many ears of corn must I give these horses ? " Rives frowned . " That boy is as likely as not to water those horses while they 're hot . " He left the room , ran down the stairway . She stood gazing out of the window for a few minutes , then set about unpacking her few belongings . She had hung her gowns up in the closet and was unfastening her riding habit when the door opened softly and an old negro woman came into the room . She advanced a few paces and stood with her broad , good-humored face bent thoughtfully upon the girl . " Which one is you ? " she demanded after a moment . Lucy had recoiled at the woman 's entrance , but she realized now that the intruder must be a privileged person . Accustomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ser vants , she smiled good-humoredly . " Miss Honoria 's daughter . You know  --  the one that died . " The woman still stood with her head to one side , a contemplativeexpression on her face . " Miss Honoria , " she said , " and Miss Ca'line . And that Jim . I know 'd ' em . I knowed ' em all . And when they told me Marse Rives done gone up in the old neighborhood and got him a wife I says to myself , Rivanna , you just step upstairs and see what she look like . " Lucy had gone over to the washstand and was laving her face and hands . She turned with an expression of childlike interest . " And who do I look like ? " The woman laughed . " You do n't favor these folks down here . You favor them other Allards . " " Did you used to live in the neighborhood ? " Rivanna moved her head slowly from side to side . " I lived thar till they sont me away . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They knowed she did n't have sense enough to do it herself . " She sighed . " But it come hard , child . I do n't like these piny woods . " She came over and with swift fingers buttoned 7 1Lucy 's gown . " Hurry up , chile , Miss Sue done come and supper ready to go on the table . " Lucy twisted around to look into the woman 's face . " Where 's Miss Sue been ? " A malicious flicker came into the old negress ' eyes . " Sashaying around , " she said . " Miss Sue just like a free nigger . Do n't know when it 's time to come home . " Lucy was curious about her mother-in-law . " What does she do when she 's sashaying around ? " she asked . The woman gave a light groan . " She like de prophet , Job , " she said . " She goes up and down the yearth . Half the time she do n't know whar she gwine . She just gits on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She sits thar till the spirit moves her and then she say , Rivanna , them Thompsons down the road got a poor little baby what 's bowels is runnin ' off , ' and off she goes . Half the time the pot would bile over at home if ' twar n't for Miss Mitty and me . " Lucy turned from smoothing her hair at the cracked mirror of the old walnut dresser . " You look like you were smart , " she said simply . The woman laughed , a high , delighted chuckle . Her knotted fingers rested a moment on the girl 's shoulder . " Go on , chile , " she said , " go on , git down them stairs . Supper ready to go on the table . " The family were still gathered in front of the fire in the big chamber when Lucy went downstairs . Mitty had drawn her chair up to the table and was sewing . In the chimney nook Rives and Miles sat side by side on a bench , talking . At the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erect in a big chair , staring into the flames . Lucy realized that this must be her mother-in-law and was advancing to meet her when the woman , hearing the noise of the opening door , turned suddenly . Lucy found herself looking into a pair of very large gray eyes . The gray-haired woman was on her feet and coming toward Lucy . She kissed the girl on the mouth with lips that seemed dry and cold , then held her off forp172a moment examining her features . " You have Honoria 's chin and eyes , " she said abruptly , " but I suppose that 's your father 's mouth . " Lucy had endured such scrutinies at the hands of relatives many times and was quite used to having her features attributed to this or that ancestor , but there was something in Mrs. Allard 's gaze that disquieted her . She was relieved when Mitty announcedthat supper was on the table . The dining room was an ell , built of logs , daubed and chinked with white clay . Rough wooden benches ran alongside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of carved rosewood . Mrs. Allard sat in one of these and Rives , after a glance at his mother , took the other . Mitty sat on her mother 's right . Occasionally she cut up some morsel from her own plate and reaching over placed it on her mother 's . Mrs. Allard would obediently take the morsel up on her fork . When she had eaten it she would relapse again into a reverie . The old negro woman , Rivanna , stood behind Mrs. Allard 's chair , her huge silver salver clasped before her like a buckler . In the intervals of serving she nodded and once went fast asleep , letting the tray fall to the floor with a great clatter . The supper , to Lucy , accustomed to the lavishness of Brackets , seemed frugal . But the dishes , though few , were well cooked . Lucy thought that that must be attributed to Mitty who evidently did most of the housekeeping . She sat now almost forgetting to eat in her anxiety to see that everybody was well served . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue bowl , Miles cried out , " Rives , I wish you 'd get married every day . " Rives finished his portion and held out his saucer for another helping . Miles did likewise . The old negress served Rives withouthesitation but delayed over bringing Miles ' saucer back . Susan Allard , seeing her whisper in Mitty 's ear gave a start . " I 'm sorry , daughter . I 'm afraid there 's no more pudding . " Mitty looked at her despairingly . Susan 's pale cheeks flushed . " I was in the milk room getting some milk for old Mr. Bascomb and I saw that big bowl of pudding . I thought it was so muchp173more than we could eat . " She looked at Lucy apologetically . " He 's such a thin old man , nearly ninety years old and with a delicate digestion . " Rives broke out in a laugh . " Now I feel like I 'm home again . Ma , where 's the old bell ? " He turned to Lucy . " When we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table , seven of us and four orphans Ma 'd taken to raise . There were eight boys in all and you know it 's hard to get enough food on one table for eight boys . The old cook used to cry sometimes . Miss Sue , make them boys leave something for us poor niggers . ' Finally Ma hit on the idea of ringing a bell toward the end of the meal . You could eat right up to the time the bell rang but you could n't take a mouthful after that . We used to call that old bell Poor Niggers . ' " Mrs. Allard was rising from the table . The others followed her into the chamber . The fire had died down and the room seemed dark . Rives brought in fresh logs and made the fire up , then sitting down on the bench in the chimney nook beckoned to Lucy to come beside him . An old hound took advantage of the open door to slip in and establish himself on the hearth rug . The boy , Miles , lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great chair at the other end of the hearth , Mitty in her low rocker by the table , sewing . She kept the conversation going , recalling incidents of childhood days . Lucy raised her head to look about the room . It had struck her as harsh and bare when she first entered it , but now , illuminated by the leaping flames , it seemed cheerful and homelike . They were talking of the absent members of the family : Tom , now a second lieutenant with the Third Georgia , Valentine the absent-minded one , Nicholas who they all said was most like Rives , the three foster brothers , Robert , Nathan , and Samuel , red-headed and freckled , the two married sisters who lived in Louisiana . Lucy pictured them all as grouped around this fire . Once she stole a glance at her mother-in-law sitting bent a little forward in her great chair . A few minutes ago Mrs. Allard had been leaning forward to listen to the talk , a smile on her lips , but now she sat , her hands linked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aware of Lucy 's glance , she looked up . Lucy saw the gray eyes which seemed too large for the small , pale face . It occurred to her suddenly that Rives had his mother 's eyes.  | TO W A R D dawn Lucy awoke but Rives ' arms wereo longer about her . She sat up , then fell back when she saw the wall over her head . The ceiling sloped menacingly low on two sides of the room . In her dreams a huge box  --  a coffin  --  had hovered over her , had been at times ready to descend , And then this dream would merge into an image of the wall of the Brackets house flaming higher and higher , and falling with a crash into the blackened wistaria vine . She drew the covers tight under her chin . She looked out into the room . She had been wakened , she realized now , by Rives ' getting out of bed . He was kneeling on the hearth , raking last night 's embers together . As she watched he threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a log from the wood-box laid it on the smoking chips . He stood with his legs spread apart , lookingmeditatively down , until the logs caught fire from the flamingchips . His hairy , muscular leg showed through the V-shaped slit at the side of his long night shirt . She lay silent , staring before her with bright eyes . This man who a few weeks ago had been only one of her numerous family connection , less known to her , really , than George Rowan , Edward Sumner , any of the boys she had grown up with , was now closer to her than anybody in the world , shared the same room , the same bed . It was incomprehensible how this had happened , and then she remembered the evening when she had run overintothe woods , stumbling ahead of Uncle Winston who was bringing the soldiers ' supper . Rives had been sitting there by the spring , had not seen her till she was almost upon him . She was crying out , really , the things she had wanted to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . . . I have n't anywhere to go .. . They do n't want me . . . . " He said , " I want you , more than anything in the world . " He said that , even before he put his arms about her . Ned , seeing how it was , had walked off toward the edge of the woods . They had sat there together till Uncle Winstoncame back grumbling . Rives stood up then and said they would ride to Hopkinsville that night and be married .. . . He was at the side of the bed , slipping in under the covers . She slid forward into his embrace . His arms moved down her body . He was spanning her waist with rough , tender hands . She moved closer to him . " I love you , " she murmured . The fire burned brighter . One of the logs that Rives had just laid on was green . From one end of it little drops of moisture formed and fell hissing into the ashes . Rives stirred , ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go away today , " he said in a low voice . " When ? " she asked . " This afternoon . " She was silent . Downstairs a bell pealed , faint at first then growing louder as the little negro boy who was ringing it walked from the out-kitchen toward the house . Rives raised up in bed . " Let 's get up . There are a lot of things to do today . " She rose , bathed her face and hands in cold water , dressed hurriedly , and went downstairs . Miles and Mitty had already breakfasted . Mrs. Allard sat alone in the dining room . She lingered a few minutes after their arrival to tell of the plans for the day . There was to be a dining . The ladies of the party would arrive early in the morning and spend the day at the loom . The ladies met three times a week now at different houses and spun and wove cloth for uniforms . The meeting was to have been at Mrs. Pilcher 's but Mrs. Allard had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had dispatched a negro boy on a horse to notify members of the ladies ' association of the change in plans . She gathered up her keys and left the room . Aunt Rivanna came in with her heavy tread to bring hot batter cakes or refillp177the syrup pitcher . Rives was putting his napkin down , " Run get your cloak , " he said . Lucy found her travelling cloak , brushed free of mud , neatly folded and hanging on the back of a chair . She put it on and fastening a woollen fascinator over her head followed him outdoors . They went through the back lot and took a path that wound up over a slope toward some woods . The field they traversed was rank with coarse grass . Last year 's cotton stalks were still standing in the rows . Lucy stooped and broke off a dead stalk . " I never saw cotton growing before , " she said . Rives did not answer . She put her hand on his arm and because she wanted to hear his voice repeated the remark . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her hand . " This is my land , " he said . She was looking at him , not understanding . He raised a finger and slowly sketched in the air a rough rectangle . " This is my field and the one next to it . Half of those woods are mine and half Tom 's . Nick 's begins on the other side of the woods . " " You mean your mother has already given you all your land ? " " When Tom was twenty-one . She parcelled it all out between us . " He guided her to the right . " See that grove over there ? I 've always thought it was a nice place for a house . Nice spring at the foot of the hill . " They approached a little hill that had on it a grove of trees . There were oaks and silver poplars and down the farther slope a line of weeping willows marked the spring . They went down to the spring and got a drink . They stayed there a long while then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizon the mountainsrose cloud-like and blue . At their feet lay the green valley . There was the field through which they had ridden last night and beyond that the pine forest . It had seemed interminable then but now it was only a darker band encircling the brighter green of the fields . Rives walked off a little way and paused beside a great twisted poplar . " We could have the house here , " he said . He stepped off the paces in a great rectangle then walked into the center of it , laid his hand on a tall oak . " This fellow would have to go , " he said , " and those three young maples but you would n't have to cut down any more of the big trees . " Lucy was still following with her eyes the rectangle he had paced off . She went now and stood a little distance from the oak tree . " The front gallery would be here , " she said . She shut her eyes . It seemed to her that she was standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white trunk of a young poplar . " We could leave that one standing , " she said . " We would n't need to cut that one down , Rives . " He came and stood beside her , measuring the distance with his eye . " It would be right near the gallery . Trees rot a house . " " You could see it from the front windows , " she said . " It would be nice in spring . " He did not answer . He was listening for something . After a second the call came again . They could see a woman 's figure framed in the doorway of the house below . She was making a trumpet of her hands to call " Rives ! Rives ! " " We 'll have to go , " Rives said . They went back down the hill . Once Lucy looked back . She could almost see the house standing there . P181RIVES had expected to rejoin Colonel Forrestmand at Huntsville where he had been furl but on his way up from Dalton he heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thigh and his col disbanded . Rives therefore went straight to Chattanooga he met Colonel Lawton , a friend of the family , who arra have him enrolled in his regiment , the Second Georgia office where the men were mustered in , he met a man had known at Donelson , Joe Troup . The two soldiers , aft papers were made out , set off on a stroll about the town . They walked along Market Street but progress was c The street was crowded with citizens who had gathered t ( the parade of some incoming regiments . Brass bands blare military police kept soldiers and citizens alike moving stantly . Joe was disgusted . " Come in , " he said , " less gel here . " The place to which he led Rives  --  " Hell 's Half Acre ' called by the citizens of the town  --  was the favorite rem of soldiers off duty . It was crowded tonight . Lanterns from the boughs of trees and pine knot torches flare crowd , which included women in frayed finery , oscilk tween the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the roulette wheels and faro and chuch spreads . Rives and Joe , too restless to settle down to any pa pleasure , passed by a roulette wheel operating under the a pine knot torch . A crowd surrounded it , those on the reaching over the shoulders of those nearest the wheel to 1p182bundles of Confederate currency on their favorite color . A little way off a ragged , Ishmaelitish-looking man was preaching . Rives and Joe passed on to where a group of men were gathered under an oak tree . There was a tall man in the center whom Rives recognized as one of the men who had come out from Fort Donelson with Forrest . Rives knew this man by reputation as an experienced scout . He was a man who knew his own value but tonight his bearing was more assured than usual , perhaps because he was telling the assembled men something that seemed to interest them greatly . " Yes , sir , " he said , " it was the middle of the night when the message come but it was all over camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for awhile , I tell you . " Rives pressed nearer . " What 's he talking about ? " he asked of the man next him . The man clicked shut the blade of an enormous knife . " He 's talking about General Forrest , " he said , " when he come up from Corinth . " " What ? " Rives said . " Have they made him a general ? " The man nodded . " They done put him in command of all the cavalry round here . But they would n't let him take his old regimentwith him , just let him pick out ten men for his escort . Tom Miles there , he was one of ' em . He 's my brother . " Something in the man 's face made Rives ask , " Were you one of ' em too ? " The man 's face had been alert and shining as he talked . It composeditself now into more decorous lines . He spat onto the root of a tree . " Yep , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the old Forrest regiment . But we 're in the escort now . " The narrator had come to the end of his tale . There was a great burst of laughter . The man who had been talking to Rives got up and edged into the circle . " Come on , Tom , " he said , " less go spin that wheel . " The tall man said he did n't care if he did . The two brothers walked off together across the hard , trampled ground . The crowd had been held together by the story . It broke into smallerp183circles , merged into other crowds . Joe Troup had been watching a group of men who sat around a stump playing poker . He said he believed he would sit in the game awhile . Rives went over with him , bought some chips and sat in a few hands then rose saying a man had just gone by whom he had to see . He walked away from the poker table but soon began to drift aimlessly with the crowd . No game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking around , seeing old and new faces and drawing into his nostrils the well-remembered odors of camp life . He found himself speaking amiably to a gambler whom he had once rejoiced to see run out of his regiment , then got away from the man to find a woman 's hand clutching his arm , a dolllikeface turned up to his . He disengaged his arm and , smiling and shaking his head , walked over to where a great tree root arched up , and sat down . He had been sitting there for a long while watching the crowd when a man came up and touched him on the shoulder . " Allard , " he said , " I been looking for you everywhere . Ben Bigstaff wants to see you . " " Where is he ? " Rives asked . " He 's been in the guard house . But they took him out . Got him over at headquarters now . " The newcomer grinned . " You better start . They might court-martial old Ben before you git there . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted him to within a few yards of the headquarters ' tent and left him . Rives had started on alone when a voice hailed him : " Well , boy , where you been ? " Rives stopped , grinning : " Where you been ? " Ben Bigstaff looked up at his tall guard , shrugged his fat shoulders . " Boarding , " he said . The guard clapped him on the back . " Well , Ben , here 's where I leave you . Do n't do nothing rash . " When the soldier had walked away Ben turned to Rives . " It was old Jackson 's brandy , " he whispered . " Coming up from Corinth . I found out which wagon it was in and I just couldn't stay out of it . Got me an auger and bored through . Put a pipe to it . " He rolled his eyes and smacked his lips . " Boy , it war n't none of this pine top ! " They had been walking rapidly while this conversation was going on and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A burly , fair-haired officer whom Rives recognized as Captain Anderson was sitting at a table just inside the tent , writing . He looked up and acknowledged the two soldiers ' salute . " Well , Ben , " he said mildly , " hear you been in a little trouble . " Bigstaff stood stiffly as if on parade . " Yes , Captain , " he said . At the same time he let the lid of his left eye droop toward Rives as if to say that a man might find himself in stranger places than the guard house before he was through . Rives , trying to stand at attention as rigidly as Bigstaff , looked past the Captain to the rear of the tent . The big man standing there with his back turned was the General . A black-haired , long-legged young officer beside him was bending over packing some saddlebags . The General was directing him what to put in . In a few minutes they came forward . The General greeted Bigstaff , then passed out of the tent with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trees and conversed in low tones . At last the young officer turned to go . The General leaned forward , laid his hand on his shoulder . Rives could see the expression on the General 's face , could hear his suddenly gentle voice : " Now , boy , you take good care of yourself . " He came back into the tent . He was sitting down in a chair beside the table , a big man with towering shoulders and black hair streaked with gray . His eyes had been soft as he gazed at his young brother . They hardened as he turned to Bigstaff . " This the man you want to take with you , Ben ? " " Yes , sir . " The General turned to Rives . " What 's your name ? " " Allard . " " I 've seen you before . Were you at Donelson ? " Rives said again , " Yes , sir . " He wanted to add that he had been among the men disbanded at Huntsville and that he had ex/petted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had collected himself . " You came out of Donelson with my boys , eh ? . . . But I 've seen you before . In Kentucky ? " " Yes , sir . At old Mr. Fontaine Allard 's . " The General nodded . " My men camped in his yard one night . The old gentleman gave me a fine horse . Killed at Donelson .... " He nodded again and as if the colloquy were ended he turned to Bigstaff . " Ben , you sure you want to take this boy with you ? " " He knows the country , " Ben said . The scout and the General exchanged a look . Whatever other questions the General might have asked seemed to be answered in that look for he suddenly turned away , to Anderson . " Charley , where 's that stuff ? " Anderson hauled up a saddlebag and spilled its contents out onto the table . A stack of blank paper sheets , pale blue , heavily embossed at the top . Ben walked over to the table , picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Provo ' marshal of Kentucky , hunh ? " Anderson was grinning . " Captain Jeffrey Forrest was going by and he thought this stuff might come in handy . " He picked up a sheet and handed it to Bigstaff . " How 's it look ? " Bigstaff studied it a moment then handed it back . " Captain , you write mighty pretty . " The Captain was modest . " I worked an hour before I set my hand to the first sheet . Look all right ? " " It looks all right , " Ben said . The General had been sitting , head bent down , evidently in deep thought . He looked up , spoke brusquely . " Ben , I 've got to get somebody over into Tennessee , as far as Murfreesboro . Here 's the way we 've got it figured . You take your papers signed by the provost marshal and work your way through . The Yankees have got home guards in most of those towns . Well , you 've got a message for the captain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How does it look to you ? " Ben turned his head slowly to one side , studied the lantern flame . " I do n't see nothing wrong with it , " he said . " Of course I could n't hit nothing but the high spots with those papers and I 'd have to come back another way .... Me and this boy 'd travel in Yankee uniform , of course . " " You 'd have to , " Forrest said , " to work this dodge . Can you think of anything better ? " " Naw , " Ben said , " I ca n't think of anything better . " He stood , reflecting , one stout leg advanced , his plump hands weaving before him an imaginary cat 's cradle . " Naw , " he said again , " it sounds all right , for that kind of trip . " " Well , what about it then ? " the General asked at length . Ben raised his head . His curious , light-colored eyes dwelt calmly on Forrest 's face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't going to volunteer for nothing . Course anything you tell me to do I 'm going to do it best I can . " The blood had surged into Forrest 's face . He knit his thick brows . An angry retort was evidently on his lips but he checked himself , took two or three quick paces to the side then turned to Bigstaff . " All right , " he said curtly . " When can you start ? " Ben 's face had changed in the last few seconds . It now wore its customary look of good humor . His voice was bland and cheerful . " Right away , " he said . " This boy 's papers ready ? " Forrest had sat down at the table beside Captain Anderson . " They 're over at the quartermaster 's , " he said , " and the uniforms . " He stood up . His voice softened suddenly . " Good-by , boys . " They left the tent , crossed the enclosure to the quartermaster 's tent . When they were out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I got him that time , did n't I ? " Rives was bewildered . " How you mean , Ben ? " " Did n't you see him stand up there and take his medicine ? " He hates to order a man out on a trip like this . But he made me mad , about that brandy . I made up my mind then I war n't going to volunteer for awhile . " They walked on . Ben was talking about Jeffrey Forrest , the General 's young brother whom he loved , Ben said , better than hisp187own son . Jeffrey was a long-legged rapscallion in Ben 's opinion . " War n't that just like him now , to capture a lot of that provo 's stationery just so some poor devil 'd have to risk his neck using it ! " They arrived at the station . Blue uniforms were handed them , one with a corporal 's chevrons , the other plain . They stripped and put them on . Ben , who seemed in high feather now , was explaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , was to discard the horses furnished by the government . He knew one of them , an old side wheeler , and the other probably just like him . He knew where there were two good horses , though , just what they needed , in a man 's stable down by the river . He passed one day and saw them horses and he 'd been keeping his eye on them ever since , knowing he might be needing a horse any day . Soon as they finished dressing and had a snack to eat they 'd slip down to the river and get the horses . Lucky it was such a dark night . Rives listened . He hardly realized that he was about to set out to steal a man 's horses , dressed in a Yankee uniform . He was still thinking of the young captain , Jeffrey Forrest , and of the Generalwho had laid his hand on Jeffrey 's arm and told him to take good care of himself.  | THEY were sitting at dinner when the little negro oy brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the others . When she had finished Mitty gave a long sigh . " I 'm glad he 's with Coloned Lawton , " she said . " I 'm glad he 's with him instead of that Colonel Forrest . " " Why , pray ? " Susan demanded . " I do n't know , " Mitty said , confused as she always was when any notice was taken of anything she said , " I thought  --  well , you did n't like him so much when you saw him at Brackets , did you , Lucy ? " " I only said I thought he looked stern . " Susan helped herself to black-eyed peas . " Sternness is a virtue in a military man , " she said . She handed the sparse dish of peas to Lucy . " Eat , child . You and Mitty need to keep up your strength when you 're spinning half the day . " " I believe Lucy 's mastered it , Mama , " Mitty said enthusiastically . " This morning she ran the thread on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , " she said kindly , " but she must n't stay at it too steady . Why n't you go lie down a while after dinner , child ? " " I believe I will , " Lucy said and got up and left the dining room . She mounted the stairs quietly but the fingers that clutched her letter were tense . The door of her own room shut behind her . She went quickly to the window and began reading the two closely written pages over again . Downstairs before the others she had read the news in the letter . Now her eyes skimmed eagerly over those sentences to find the phrases that were meantp189for her alone . " Last night before I went to sleep I thought of you for a long time . . . . Joe Troup is here . He says . . . . " No , that could wait for a second reading . Her eyes flew on , to the end : " I ca n't believe that you love me as much as I love you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe it but I will love to hear you say it . Yes , I will write every day that I can and you do the same but , darling , if a day should pass when I ca n't write do n't let that stop you . ... " She gave a long sigh and , still holding the letter in her hand , walked over to the deal table that she used as a desk . She got out a sheet of paper and dipping her pen in the ink  --  red ink that they had made from oak galls  --  began to write : " Dearest , dearest Rives . . . . " Then she laid the pen down . If she wrote now she would have to do it hurriedly . In a half-hour or at most an hour they would expect her back in the loom room . It would be better to wait until tonight when alone in her own room she could think of what she wanted to say . She lay down on the bed . Lying there staring at the ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination she traversed the path up over the slope and then down the steep descent to the spring . She had drunk cold water from his cupped hands and then they had flung themselves down on last year 's leaves under the oak tree . The sun had been hot coming through the field but the woods still kept some of their winter chill . He said , " Love , your hands are cold , " as he drew her to him . They had stayed there a long while . It seemed to her that she could hear time , hear it running through the woods . Or no , you could stop it , hold it at bay for a little then some bird would call or the woods about them would stir and time would begin again . Once some small animal ran through a near-by thicket and she started up . He laughed , pulling her down beside him . " You remind me of a little mare I had once named Kitty . " " Why ? " she asked . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckon . " She knew that he meant that she was wild and restless and that as Mammy once said she had eyes like a nervous colt . Shep190got up on her knees and faced him . " I wish I was different , " she said . " I wish I was the best person in the world . " He was smiling . He put his hand up and traced an imaginary line above one of her eyebrows . " I would n't have it go this way , even that much , " he said and then he brushed the palms of his hands over her cheeks . " I would n't have anything about you different . " She showed him how on one hand the little finger grew out crooked from the others and she showed him how plain she looked with her hair drawn back tight from her face . They laughed together . " You do n't know how bad I am , " she said , and she told him how she had flirted with Spencer Rowe and how once years ago she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Mimy give Della a beating for it . " I wanted to tell , " she said , " but something kept saying no : " " You were scared , " he said . " Children will do anything when they 're scared . " He told her how he had felt about his father 's death , how as a child he had thought that it was through some fault of his father 's that he got killed and how it was only after he was grown that he realized that his father was a good and brave man . All the time they were talking she had kept looking at him , telling herself that if she did n't she would be sorry tomorrow . She reached up and touched his cheeks , pressing her finger tips into the hollow about his eyes . " I tell myself you wo n't be here tomorrow , " she said wildly . " I keep telling myself but I ca n't make it seem true . How can you leave me ? How can they take you away ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time came back then and did n't go away . He said , " It is n't they , " and kissed her , oh , a dozen times . But his face , even his eyes when he looked at her had changed . After a little he got to his feet and drew her up beside him . " We ought to go , " he said . She looked around , at the little branch , at the new leaves . She was going to say " No , let 's stay another five minutes , another ten .... " But she knew that it would be the same at the end ofp191those minutes . " Yes , " she said , " we ought to have gone a good while ago , " and she stepped up the path so fast that he had to hurry to catch up with her . They stayed in the grove on the top of the hill a little while and then they went back to the house . She got up now and going to the window pushed the blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , she had descended the same path and had sat down on the very spot where they had been that day . She had thought she could tell by the way the leaves were pressed down the place where Rives ' body had lain and she had pressed her hand upon it . But she could feel the chill of the earth under the dry leaves and the whole hollow seemed darker now that the leaves were out full . After a little she got up and came back up the hill . She turned from the window . Going to the bed she took Rives ' letter up and thrust it inside the bosom of her dress . Then she went to the washstand and bathed her face and hands and rearranged her hair . The face she saw in the mirror was pale . Her eyes showed that she had been crying . " I look plain , " she thought . " I look almost as plain as Mitty . " There was a tap on the door . She opened it . A little negress looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Miss Sue out in the loom room . She say if you come down now she show you about that twist . " Lucy stood looking down at the child a moment then she said , " All right , " and followed her down the stairs  | IT was almost dark when Rives and Ben came up over the rise and stopped . Off to the left was the sound of water plashing over stones . Ben cocked his ear at the sound . " What crick 's that ? " " That 's Double Springs , " Rives told him . Ben grunted . " I ai n't anxious to get into that town too soon . I reckon this is as good a place to stop as any . " Rives did not answer . He was out of breath . And he still did not know why they had left the road so suddenly . They had came out of Woodbury with a squad of Yankee cavalry . Rives , riding along silently , had admired the ease with which Ben sustainedconversation with the Yankee corporal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He remembered hearing long ago that Ben had once been in the United States army . His experience was evidently of great service to him . Adroitly during the afternoon he had introduced references to places he had been stationed , bits of information about certain regiments , finally the names of one or two officers he had served under . Then suddenly , a few miles out of Murfreesboro he had stopped , snapping his fingers as if he had just remembered something . " Allen , " he said , Allen was the name Rives travelled under and Ben called himself Higgins , " Allen , what in the devil did you let me forget that letter for ? " " What letter ? " Rives asked before he thought . Ben 's voice was sarcastic . " Allen , you 'll go far . " He turned to the red-faced corporal . " Our colonel 's sweet on a lady back there in Woodbury and here we 've done rode by and forgot to give her the letter . " The corporal had looked surprised and , Rives thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . Nobody ever knew what , for Ben grasped his hand , shook it , told him what a pleasure it had been to travel with him and was riding back up the road before anybody concerned had had time to get his breath . Rives followed . They had ridden on in silence  --  not too fast . Rives remembered now the prickling sensation he had had in his back . The corporal and his troop might be after them any minute . But they had not come . Finally at a cross-roads Ben stopped , glanced swiftly around and then without a word to Rives dove into a little used trail that led back toward the town . They had progressed along this until it came to an end when they had left the horses in a thicket and made the rest of the distance on foot . They went down to the water 's edge now and fell on their knees to drink out of their cupped hands . Ben sat down on a rock . He was panting . " Lord , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked at Rives . " It ai n't so hard on a lean feller like you . " Rives , still kneeling at the water 's edge , splashed the water on his dusty face . " Well , what 'd we leave the road for ? " he asked . " Seemed to me we were getting along all right . " Ben shook his head irritably . " Yeah , you was so busy thinking about how smart we was you did n't look at that feller . I tell you he was on to us . " " How do you know ? " " My fault , " Ben said wearily . " I was too smart too . Talked too much . I made a slip back there , about that Captain Renshaw . I thought the damn fool was dead or kicked out of the army by this time . But he must be somewhere right around here . Did n't you see that feller look at me kind of surprised ? 1 knew then it was up to us to move . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Renshaw . . . " He remembered too that the man had been quiet for some minutes after that but he had thought nothing of it . He realized now , however , that Ben was probably right.  | " Well , what we going to do now ? " he asked . " Oh , I do n't know , " Ben said irritably . " I got to study it out . " He twisted around and looked over the meadow behind him . " If I was you I 'd go out and gather up some of this here wild hay for those horses . We may have to leave here in a hurry tonight . " Rives gathered the hay and put it down before the two horses . He did not have to bring them down to drink ; they had watered them at Cripple Creek a half an hour ago . When he got back , Ben had taken a can of sardines out of his haversack and was struggling to open it with his clasp knife . He was curiously unskilful at any mechanical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and set it down on a rock . He brought some hardtackout of his pocket and they ate it with the sardines . Ben 's irritation seemed to have disappeared . He talked of desultory matters as they ate . As they got out a second can of sardines  --  they were plentifully supplied with this delicacy  --  he laughed . " I was thinking about when I was with Morgan , " he explained . " One thing when I start out on a trip like this I got to eat . The best they got is none too good for me . One time I was going out for Morgan and one of them rapscallion cooks packed my lunch . They was n't anything in it but sow-belly and cold hoe cake . Well , I come in about midnight . The General was waiting up for me . Well , Bigstaff , ' he says , what you got to tell me ? ' I looked him right in the eye . General , ' I says , ' they 's one thing I got to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man lays on his belly all night on the cold ground he wants to have something in it . ' " He laughs and says What do you like to cat ? ' " Well , ' I says , I ai n't got nothing against cheese but if you give me my pick I 'll take sardines . ' " All right , ' he says , you shall have sardines . And now what you got to tell me ? ' " Well , they was a whole gang of Yankees coming in . I 'd found out which road they was on and when they was coming . He was tickled because he knew he could go right down and scoop ' em in . Bigstaff , ' he says , you can have all the sardines you want . Ip195only wisht I had some whale to give you . I 'd like to see what you could do on a whale . ' " Rives laughed . " I did n't know you 'd been with Morgan , Ben . When was that ? " " A good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got myself transferred . It ai n't every one of them generals I can git along with . " " Which 'd you rather be with , Morgan or Forrest ? " Ben considered . " I reckon I 'd take Forrest . " " Why ? " Rives persisted . Ben shook his head . " I do n't know . Just something about him suits me better . Morgan 's all hell for leather . The General he rides hard , too , but he do n't never forget where he 's going . " He stood up , brushing the crumbs from his pants . " Them sardines tasted all right . Now , boy , we got to get started . How far you reckon it is into that town ? " Rives looked at the lights of the little town glimmering through the mist . " It 's about two miles from here , I reckon . " Ben nodded reflectively . " And the pickets 'll be pushed out a mile or so outside town . Well , we 'll just have to work across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought we were going to ride into town , " Rives said . " We got Yankee uniforms and we got papers . Why ca n't we just ride into town ? " Ben looked at him contemptuously . " We ca n't do that , now I made that slip . They 'd be laying for us , sure . Naw , the only thing to do now is to catch us a picket and shake him till he spits . If he do n't know what we want to know we 'll have to try some ether way . " He waded across the shallow stream , then stopped . " I 'll tell you something else , " he said , " it 's a thing mighty few people seem to know , about how to work up on a picket . " Rives looked at him intently . " How do you do it , Ben ? " " Do n't fool with the man . Slip up on the horse . Slip up and cut the horse 's tether then get back to cover . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when they find out it 's just a horse they 'll go back to sleep . And any noise they hear after that they'll say that 's just that old loose horse . Gives you a chance to turn around . See ? " Rives nodded . " I 'll do just like you say , Ben . " Ben laughed shortly . " You better . " They walked up the slope , climbed a fence and struck a field full of corn . Ben worked across it by slipping down first one row after another and Rives followed his example . Late in the night they came out on a high meadow overlooking the town . Most of the lamps in the houses had been put out but lights still showed in the military encampment . The two men crouched in the shadow of a clump of bushes . From the road , a quarter of a mile away , came the measured beat of hoofs : a body of cavalry was evidently moving out of the town . Ben was silent for a while , listening , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's that ? " Rives heard voices . They were some distance off yet but they seemed to be approaching . Ben had relaxed . " It 's all right , " he whispered . " They 're changing the pickets . " They sat quiet . The voices were closer now . They heard a man 's laugh and then another man 's voice answering . There was a rustling of bushes , probably a horse being tethered and then retreating footsteps . Ben sighed . " Them Yankees ! Why do n't they change their pickets earlier ? Now we got to wait till they settle down . " He sank back on the ground . His breathing became heavy . He was asleep . Rives stretched himself out too . But he was too excitedto sleep and after a little he sat up . There was still a moon but it was veiled with mist . Mist was everywhere . It had been creeping up slowly from the creek bed in the last hour and now it was drifting as high as a man 's head in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the last few minutes . He was shut in with his thoughts . He took a plug of tobacco out of his pocket and bit off a chew . His mind went back over the events of the last ten days . It had been ten days since they left Chattanooga . It seemed years . He thought of the different towns they had been in , of the Yankees they had encountered . It seemed impossiblep197that you could slip in among them , sit around , talk , swap stories and not be discovered . Ben had a theory about that . " Do n't let your mind run on yourself and you 're all right . " Another of his maxims was " Get ' em tickled . " Rives grinned , thinking of a story Ben had told the corporal . He had a fund of lewd stories which he said came in handy on trips like these . A few minutes after he met a man he would give him a quizzical look ; " Ever hear the one about the old maid and the parson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had tears streaming down his face as he examined or pretended to examine their papers . He thought of Lucy . He had written to her just before he met Joe Troup that night . And an hour later , involuntarily he straightened his shoulders , he had been picked as one of Forrest'sscouts . He had had plenty of opportunities to write to her on the way over here but Ben had cautioned him against putting anything down on paper . He wondered what she would think when she did n't hear from him , for ten days , maybe even two weeks . Mentally he began a letter to her , a mild but he thought humorous version of Ben Bigstaff 's character and eccentricities and then his thoughts stopped short . He remembered something Ben had said to him , looking up suddenly as they rode along a dusty by-road . " See here . One thing to remember . When we get back from this trip you do n't know me and I do n't know you . " He grinned after saying that and shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Well , now you started on this kind of work you better not write home so often . If you do tell her about the little birdies in the woods , how sweet they sing . " He would not be able to give Lucy any real explanation of his ten-day silence . He would just have to say that his duties had prevented him from writing . Perhaps he could give her some intimation of the nature of the service he was engaged in but if he kept on being a scout he would never again be able to write her the kind of letters he had written before  --  the kind of letters he knew she expected him to write . The footfalls he had been hearing ceased . The pickets had evidentlysettled down for the night . There were no sounds at all except field rustlings and the occasional twitter of some bird . He knew now why Ben Bigstaff and Tom Miles were different from the others . They were alone so much , nobody to talk to but themselves , in the dark half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . He wanted to be sent out again ... . Ben sat up suddenly as if awakened by the silence . He touched Rives on the arm . " Let 's start now , " he whispered . " Work that horse trick . " They moved off , lifting their feet almost in unison , making the same stops . They could not see the man they were creeping up on but they could make out the ears of his horse jutting through the mist . " Half them horses got more sense than the pickets , " Ben had said . This horse had got wind of their approachalready . He was moving restlessly . They waited . He got quiet . They still could not see the man but they could heal ' him breathing . Ben touched Rives peremptorily on the arm and went forward alone . Rives could hear his foot fall softly on the ground each time , hear the horse move suddenly as he came up and then the rasp of the rope as it was cut . The horse took two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up out of the mist . A man 's voice rang out . " Joe , git up ! " The man who had called was coming toward Rives . He dodged , but the man dodged too , and caught him by the shoulders . Rives ' arms were pinioned to his sides by powerful hands . There was hot breath on his neck . " Oh , you would , would you ? " the voice said . Rives walked slowly forward beside his captor . The picket was just rising up . He struck a match . His blanket trailing off over his shoulders gave him an old womanish look . He said : " Steve ! Thank the Lord it 's you . " Steve laughed . " You better be thankful , " he said . The picket bent and lit the lantern he had set down beside a bush . " I just dropped off , " he said ; " war n't more'n two min-utes . " Steve said that it was lucky he had come over to borrow ap199chew of tobacco . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less see . " Rives stood still while they searched him . He strained his ears and then an excited grin came on his face . He was certain now that he had heard footsteps making off over the rise . It was all right . Ben had got away !  | THE Federal soldiers took Rives through the streets to e brick jail on the public square . Its halls were full of soldiers , some on guard , some lounging about and talking . Inthe upper hall to which Rives was taken a group of civilians under guard awaited their trial in one of various " courts " set up in the building . One of these prisoners , a portly man of fifty-five or sixty , had evidently just been brought in for he was still pro-testingagainst his arrest , volubly and with ineffectual jerkings of his hands and feet . Rives recognized this man as a Mr. Galloway , whose farm adjoined his uncle 's . As he passed , so close that his sleeve brushed the other man 's , he spoke to him in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly voice , Galloway turned quickly . He stared at Rives a moment with drawn brows and open mouth , and then , as if the effort to identify this strange face were too much for him , he buried his face with its working features on his arm while angry sobs shook his body . The soldiers took Rives swiftly down the hall and , unlocking the door of a cell , thrust him inside . The cell had two occupants . One , a handsome young man with curling chestnut hair and fine brown eyes , sat on the edge of a cot , gazing fixedly at the wall . He did not turn his head when Rives entered or give any recognition of his presence . The other man , heavier set and some ten or twelve years older , was pacing up and down the room . He wheeled when Rives came in , looked him over , then , noddingcurtly , went on with his restless walking . Rives sat down on the only chair in the room . The guard had not taken away his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now , lighting up , he reviewed his situation . His excitementp201had died down . He began to realize that he lacked the peculiar talents necessary to extricate himself from such a situation . He was badly frightened . His meditations were interrupted by the jailer , who brought a tray of food and set it inside the door . He had evidently heard that Rives was a deserter , for , as he set the tray down , he winked , observing : " Well , Bud , you 'll get a square meal now . " The older of Rives ' two companions wheeled . He stood looking at Rives as if trying to make up his mind about him , and then a peculiar glancing light came in his eye . " Could n't bring it off , eh ? " he asked . Rives had determined that even before these Confederates he would continue to play the deserter , so he answered sullenly that he had n't had a square meal now in some weeks and would he glad to get one , even if it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food , which was coarse but plentiful . The young man ate in silence for some minutes , then seeming to recollect himself , he turned to Rives and courteously asked him his name and regiment . He himself , he said , was Captain Robert Williams of the Eighth Alabama . He had been taken prisoner at the Battle of Shiloh and forwarded to a Federal prison in Indiana . He had made his escape and got back to Nashville to find it in possession of the Federals . Friends in that city had placed him in company with " Mister Paul "  --  here he bowed slightly  --  who was familiar with the routes leading out of the city between the Federal pickets . At Black 's shop , on the Murfreesboro turnpike , he and his companion had run into some Federal pickets . " And , " he concluded with a charming , melancholysmile , " being in citizens ' clothes it has gone hard with me . " The older man listened to his recital with a noncommittal expression . Once or twice he shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They know my face . That 's the trouble , " he said . " I told ' em , " he jerked his finger toward the young officer , " I told ' em he did n't know any more about the stuff they found on me than a babe unborn . But they didn'tp202listen . They do n't never listen . After they take you up . Yep . It 's all over , once they take you up . " The door opened . A tall man in clergyman 's dress entered . He at once went up to Captain Williams and half embraced him , addressing him as " Robert " in a voice shaken by emotion . After a little he and the young officer withdrew to a corner of the room , where they could be heard conversing in low tones . The spy , James Paul , seemed to be made more restless by this low-voiced , earnest conversation . He walked up and down the room , taking shorter and shorter turns and finally coming to stand by the window . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while ago . A little girl playing in the yard of a house opposite the jail building had been fired upon by a soldier . The bullet struck the child in the throat , wounding her severely . The soldier , a poor , half-crazed creature , got on his horse and fled from town before he could be apprehended . The parents of the child , ardent Secessionists , had not , however , been allowed to take her into the house , which was occupied by Union officers , and she had lain now for an hour upon a hastily improvised bed in the yard . During this time she had been almost constantly surrounded by a curious throng , composed mainly of soldiers . These men , accustomed to bloodshed in battle , had never before seen a child wounded and for an hour they filed by staring down at the little girl as she lay supported in the arms of her mother . The spy , Paul , was as deeply interested in this scene as the soldiers outside were , and as he stood at the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the child . Rives , sitting on the cot , gazed straight before him . He hardly heard the man 's voice and ( lid not trouble himself to respond . Up to this minute he had supposed that these men were in the same plight as himself and had given them little thought , being occupied with revolving in his mind his own situation . But something , some note in the clergyman 's voice , or expression on the face of the young kneeling officer had suddenly arrested his attention . He had suddenly realized that these men hadp203already appeared before a court martial , had been condemned , and doubtless would be executed within a few hours . The spy , Paul , meanwhile , continued with rising excitement to report on the scene outside : " The old man must have taken the oath of allegiance . They 're bringing the doctor . Yep . That 's the doctor . Black bag and everything . " He was silent for a moment , then , as the crowd fell back under the doctor 's peremptorygestures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child lying on the pallet with the bloody bandages about her throat . He craned his neck out of the window until the crowd , surging in again , shut off his view of the scene ; then he turned to Rives , shaking his head and laying his hand on his throat , " Must have clipped the jugular , " he said . " I knew a fellow once got hit like that . They sewed him up all right , but all he could ever say after that was Hobble Gobble . ' Yep , if that kid over there comes through , expect she 'll be in the same fix . Hobble Gobble . " He laid his hand again on his throat and laughed not unkindly and yet with real mirth . The clergyman and the young officer had concluded their conversation and the clergyman now approached the spy . The latter suffered himself to be drawn aside , but his colloquy with the minister was short and he was evidently relieved when it was finished . The young officer , on the contrary , seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . Seated on the edge of the cot and looking from one to the other with bright eyes he talked vivaciously and cheerfully of his situation . His chief concern now seemed to be whether his mother and sister and a young lady , " a friend of the family , " who had set out to ride from Huntsville to Murfreesboro would arrive there before dawn . The message sent shortly after he had been captured had surely reached Huntsville . There were still good horses available in the town . If they had started at once they might arrive in Murfreesboro by three o'clock , possibly earlier . Rives listened . Everything the young officer said or did was now of the greatest interest to him and yet all the time therep204was in the back of his mind the half-angry thought that this man , whose every movement and speech were to him so strange , so fascinating , would soon be dead and would never speak or move again . The spy 's restlessness , on the contrary , seemed to be increased by the young officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Once he turned to Rives and asked if he had a deck of cards . Rives said that he had n't . The spy frowned . " That 's too bad , " he said . He resumed his pacing , then suddenly came up to Rives again . " You got any money ? " Rives nodded and drew a bill from a pocket of his shirt . A smile of childlike happiness came on the spy 's face . He snatched the money from Rives and , running to the door , knocked until the guard came and sold him a deck of cards . He now proposed a three-handed game of Set Back . The young officer declined , saying that he had one or two more letters to write . Rives and the spy , seated on the cot , began to play . The night wore on . The young officer , his letters written , was lying in a corner of the cell on a folded blanket , his head pillowedon his arm . When his eyes fell on his companions he smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighty matters . Occasionally his lips were seen to move . The game of Set Back ended  --  the spy had won all of Rives ' money . He leaned back against the wall , weary , and yet he seemed not to be able to go to sleep . Finally he began to speak almost like a man talking to himself and yet turning to Rives now and then as if to assure himself that he had a listener . His speech concerned his experiences in the army . Early in the war he had developed peculiar talents and , these talents being recognized , he had been shunted first from regiment to regiment , then from brigade to brigade , division to division . Like an old man who will not spare the listener any minutiae , however tedious , he recited details of the positions of the two armies in half a dozen encounters , occasionally interrupting himself with ap205glance at Rives as if to say as old men do , " Where was I ? I forgotwhat I was talking about . " And then in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some under-officer 's name , came the story of a comrade , taken as he himself had almost been taken between the lines at Corinth . The man steppinginto the Federal pickets ' traps had turned around , thinkingthat he , Paul , had betrayed him , had given him one look before he was led off . " I did n't have time to tell him , " he said heavily , looking down at his hands swinging between his spread knees . " They did n't give me time to tell him . . . " It was in the midst of this long drawn-out , monotonous and terrible story that Rives heard , at first from far away and then coming rapidly nearer , the hoof-beats of horses on the hard turnpikeand the yell of oncoming cavalrymen . He leaped to his feet . The other two were already at the window . They hung out , staring . The streets were full of cavalrymenand fleeing citizens . The spy turned around . He was laughing till his eyes were mere slits in his fat face . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's done captured the town ! "  | Williams turned around . " It ca n't be , " he cried , " Forrest is n't anywhere near this town . " " Yes he is , " Rives told him . " He was on his way here when Ileft his command at Chattanooga . " The young officer came toward Rives . " Are you sure of that ? " he asked in a trembling voice . " Are you one of Forrest 's men ? " " I 'm one of his scouts , " Rives said . The spy , Paul , had been straining out of the window , oblivious to the conversation going on behind him but now he turned . " He 's right , Williams . I could tell he was up to something way he looked when he came in here . " The young officer looked from one to the other . His eyes were blazing . " We 'll get out then , " he cried . " They 'll get us out ! " and he rushed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Confederate cavalry was inside the prison yard now . The Rebel yell rose , sudden and fierce . There was the sound of firing . The spy pounded Williams on the back . " The Yanks are running ! " he shouted . The sounds without were obscured by the trampling of feet on the stairs . Rives got away from the window , stood with his hand cupped over his ear . " They 're getting out through the prison , " he said . " Somebody 's coming up here , " Williams said . The three prisoners stood , listening , while the trampling feet came nearer . Suddenly the door was unlocked and two guards burst in . They had muskets which they levelled upon the prisoners . But before they could shoot the three prisoners had scuttled across the boards like rats and were crouching behind the door.  |p207The  man with the musket whirled and was taking aim at them when the door banged to , hiding the bodies of the crouchingmen . He called to his comrade : " Bill , hold that door open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't goin ' to do it . You 'd shoot my blamed hand off . " As he spoke he was taking something from his pocket then he dodged into the hall , stooped a moment and was gone down the corridor . His voice floated back . " Better hurry . They 're battering the door down . " The man with the musket lunged after him out of the room . They heard the lock click to and then there was silence except for the battering sounds below . Rives tasted wet wool . His open mouth for some minutes had been pressed against the spy 's fat back . He heaved his shoulders furiously upward . The spy tumbled out onto the floor and the other two crawled after him . They remained on all fours for a minute glaring about them then got cautiously to their feet . Rives was shaking with rage and fright . In the effort to control himself he began mechanicallypicking dust and lint from his clothes . The spy had sat down beside the table and was cursing softly and monotonously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the ceiling . His light-colored eyes were intent . Rives saw his nostrils slowly lift and widen . " They 've set fire to the place , boys , " he said . Williams raised his head , sniffed until he , too , caught the smell . " That 's what he was doing in the hall , " he said calmly . He stepped quickly to the door , looked through the grating . " Those loose planks , " he said . " He stuck a bunch of papers under them . " The spy stood up . He was trembling all over . " We better try to break the door down , " he said . The three men hurled themselves against the door but it was made of iron with hinges sunk deep in an oak jamb and it held . They tried it again and again until their shoulders were bruised and the breath knocked from their bodies . The spy gave the word to stop . " My heart 's bad , " he groaned . " I ca n't stand much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sweat , was about to stagger to a seat when he met Williams ' blazing eyes . " Come on , " Williams sobbed , " I 'm not going to die like a rat in a trap , " and he hurled himself at the door again . Rives found himself wasting precious , angry breath . " Stop that , man . You ca n't do any good by yourself . " He had Williams by the shoulder , was drawing him away from the door when he heard footsteps rushing down the hall and stepped back . The spy , still groaning in his chair , looked up . " Our men ? " Williams rushed to the grating . " Our men , " he yelled , " and they 've got a chain of buckets . " There were rapid steps down the hall . A face appeared at the grating . " Stand aside , boys , " a voice called . A few minutes later the hinges tore from the oak and the heavy door clattered inward and fell . The prisoners stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was full of soldiers . Some of them were laughing . One gave Rives a slap on the back as he staggered toward the stairs . " Tried to burn you up , did they ? Reckon you 're glad old Forrest made it in time . " Prisoners were being released from cells all along the passage way . A sergeant herded them down the stairs and out into the open . The prison yard was full of dismounted cavalrymen . Rives , with some of the released prisoners , went over to a bench at the side of the yard and sat down . Presently he was aware that Williams and Paul were no longer with him . At the same time he realized that most of the cavalrymen were mounting to ride away . " What is it ? " he asked dully . " Where are they going ? " The man next to him , a tall , lean countryman , answered . " Over to the square . They 've done took this place and the depot and now they 're going over to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jail ? " Rives asked . " Lawton 's Georgians . And now they 're going to take the courthouse . "  |p209The  man rose as he spoke . Rives rose too and walked beside him . The mention of Lawton 's Georgians , the regiment in which he had so lately enrolled , recalled him to a sense of duty . He wanted to rejoin his regiment as soon as he could but he did not know how to go about it . It seemed easier to walk beside the stranger through the streets which were lighted now with torches and thronged with civilians . Once the people fell aside to make way for a detail of galloping soldiers and then yelled wildly as the ruddy torchlight revealed the horseman in the center of the group , a man wearing only a nightshirt who rode stiffly , his arms bound to his sides . Rives ' companion laughed loudly and threw his hat in the air . " Yankee provost marshal , " he gasped when he was able to walk on . " Do n't them shirt tails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provost marshal , Oliver Cromwell Rounds , had incurred the hatred of the whole countryside becauseof his tyranny . People were already delighting in the rumor that the Confederate soldiers when making his arrest had pulled him out from between two feather beds . " In a young lady 's room , " the countryman added with a wink . " I ai n't telling who it was . " They arrived on the outskirts of the square and found that the besieged garrison had already surrendered . The crowd of civiliansfell back as the prisoners , men of a Michigan regiment , were brought into the yard and lined up . With them were some of the guards who had fled from the jail . Rives saw Williams . He was walking with an officer in front of the line of prisoners . Rives saw him stop before a man , give him a long look then raise his finger and knew that he was identifying the guard who had set fire to the prison . He watched the cavalrymen lead the guard off . He wondered whether the orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given any sort of trial . The officer with Williams turned around . It was General Forrest . He was walking over to the side of the courthouse to mount his horse . Rives saw the gigantic figure of Captain Boone , commander of the escort , among the men waiting there . He was about to go over to Boone , to ask him whether he should report back to the Georgia regiment or whether he should consider himself attached to the escort when he was aware that Boone and the men around him were all looking in one direction . Rives looked and saw that the door of one of the red-brick houses on the square had opened . A slender woman dressed in black was coming down the path . She had a handkerchief in one hand . A silver spoon glinted in the other . She was coming straight up to the General . Rives heard her voice , low but distinct : " General Forrest , will you back your horse for me ? " The cavalry commander looked down , startled , then lifted his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a powerful gray , took two steps backward . The woman bent over and with the silver spoon scooped up some of the earth on which the charger 's hoof had rested and put it in the handkerchief , then without a word to the General she walked back up the path , the laden handkerchief clutched in her hand . The crowd cheered tumultuously and cried , " Forrest ! For-rest ! " Forrest was riding toward them . His hat was still off , a lock of black hair had fallen across his forehead . His expression was stern then as if he had just realized what the woman 's action meant , he smiled and held up his hand for quiet . The people , he said , must go to their homes . The town was safe , the Yankees would not get it again but the soldiers still had work to do ; the detachment of infantry across Stone 's River was yet to be dealt with . He let his hand sink to his side . His face resumed its usual stern expression . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressing close behind . The crowd began to disperse . Here and there torches were extinguished . Those that were left flickered palely as the morninglight grew . People started and looked at one another when from behind the courthouse a single shot rang out . Rives , standing with the others , drew in deep breaths of the cool air . He had seen a man led off to die , had just heard the shotp211that killed him . He knew that he himself would not be standing here in this fresh morning light if the Confederates had not capturedthe town and his eyes followed the towering figure on the gray horse till it was lost in the crowd.  |p212LUCY  came out of the house and walked slowly acrossthe back yard . In front of the smokehouse Susan Allard and old Rivanna were at work . They had brought in armfuls of the wild castor bean plants late yesterday afternoon and now they were expressing the oil in the great scalding kettle . Susan stood beside it now , stirring the contents with a stick . Old Rivanna was squatting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a mortar . She looked up as Lucy approached . " Going over to the swamp now , honey ? I 'd go with you if I did n't have to stay here and help Miss Sue . " Susan stepped back from the steaming pot . She wore a faded calico blouse . Her heavy homespun skirt  --  it had been made too big for her or she had got thinner in the last few months  --  sagged at the waist and showed a little strip of pale flesh . She seemed unconscious of her appearance , however , as she lifted her hand and pushed gray strands of hair back from her heated forehead . " What 's there to be afraid of , Rivanna ? " she asked coldly . The negress got to her feet , yawning . " Your meat 's showing , Miss Sue , " she said matter-of-factly . " You ai n't afraid of the devil and high water , but it ai n't natural for a young gal to go traipsin off in them swamps by herself . " She leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pot . " Smell it , honey . " Lucy drew back , wrinkling her nose . " I would n't take a dose of castor oil if I were to die for it . " " Humph , " Susan said , " you might be glad to get it , Miss . " She took up the ladle where Rivanna had let it fall , tilted it sop213that a few heavy drops fell out . " See , almost transparent . I believe this is going to be as fine as that Mr. Gossett showed us . " She was looking at her daughter-in-law , her strange bright eyes shining . Lucy 's face softened . " I believe it is , " she said . " Well , you ought to get nearly a gallon out of this boiling . " Molly , the fourteen-year-old negro girl , came up , leading the horse , " Yankee . " Lucy took the halter from her and they went out of the yard and up over the field . They walked in the shade of the fence row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it had not had any crops on it for two years now  --  was bare or covered with short , harsh grass . Still the horse managed to find a bite here and there . Lucy let him stop and browse where he would . He would need all the strength he could muster for the trip to the cane brake and back . She herself was glad to walk along slowly in the sparse shade . If she were not taking the horse to get fodder she would be in the office with Mitty , tramping back and forth beside the spinning wheel or , worse , reeling the thread she had spun . They came to the wagon road that bisected this field . Molly was pointing . " ' Long about here , Miss Lucy , war n't it ? " Lucy said " Yes , " her voice sounding harsh in her own ears . It seemed a long time ago . She and Mitty and Cousin Susan had been sitting down to an early supper when Molly came into the ( lining room , screaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers . " The three of them had run out into the hall . A Yankee officer was coming in the door . He said , " Madam , I want to use your roof for observation , " pushed past Susan , and was up the steps when a voice sang out from the porch : " No use , Schofield . Here they come now . " The Yankee officer was out of the house and up on his horse in two seconds . Men were crowding up around him . He pointed to the road across the field , jumped his horse over the low-paling fence . They were all after him in a minute . The women watched them tearing over the field , saw them disappear in a grove of trees , and then the Confederate cavalry was in the yard . Mitty and Lucy ran to meet them . Lucy remembered that she had run up to the brown-bearded captain , pant/ing : " Take me . I 'll show you . " But he shook his head and went on through the gate , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yankees . It seemed a long time before they heard any sounds of fighting , and then all of a sudden bullets whined and smoke was drifting up over the silver poplar trees . They went inside the house . Mitty sat down at her place at the table . The girl Molly got in that corner between the sideboard and the wall and kept moaning . Susan and Lucy went back out on the porch , but they could n't see much . After a little , bulletsdid not come so often , then they stopped . Susan turned to Lucy . " We 'd better go down now , " she said . She walked into the dining room . The girl was still crying . Susan fetched her a clip on the head . " Are n't you ashamed of yourself , crying like that , when men are over there wounded and dying ? " She had been snatching old tablecloths out of the sideboard drawer as she spoke , took down from somewhere a basket of lint . They ran over the field and down into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except for one or two blue on the ground . The brown-bearded officer had stood beside this tree , a bitter , **25;4995;TOOLONG man with the smell of sweat and blood upon him . He did not seem to know that one of his arms was hurt , tried to raise it to the felt hat that clung to the back of his head , then winced . His mouth was wry with the pain , but he spoke formally to Susan : " Most kind , Madam ... yes , one or two of our boys . . . . " His face went soft suddenly in the middle . He passed his good hand before his mouth . " Captain Linton , " he said in a different voice , " if you would just . . . Captain Linton ... " Captain Linton was lying on his back in a clump of ironweed . Blood was all over the front of him . She bent over , said , " Can you walk ? " He looked at her and his fair eyebrows met . A whistling sound came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrust her shoulder under his  --  he was not tall  --  and they went slowly up the slope . Mitty saw them and came running . Together they dragged him into the house , laid him down on the parlor sofa . She did not know what to do and neither did Mitty . His facep215was pasty green and the whistling sound had started again . Mitty went to the kitchen to get some water . She stood over him . He was lying back , his eyes closed and suddenly he sat up . He put his hands to his chest . Something was inside , trying to get out . It was tearing him to pieces . His eyes rolled back in his head , but he was still looking at her . She ran out of the room , through the hall , out on to the porch . She stared at the trees , the sky . But they looked strange . She put her head down on the wooden railing . Susan was beside her . She said : " That man in the parlor has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and went back into the house . Uncle Mack was waiting there to help move the wounded man . They got him on to the bed in the spare room by the hardest . He lay back , cocked one eyebrow and fainted . As soon as he came to , Susan hurried out into the other room . There were three other wounded soldiers , two lying on her big bed and one who would not sit or lie down but stood with his right arm dangling at his side . Susan said his arm was broken and she sent Molly on the horse for the doctor . It was three miles there and back . The doctor arrived at five o'clock . Lucy heard him step up on the front porch , then go through the hall into the chamber . He stayed in there a while , then came out , closing the door behind him . He and Susan talked . She heard him say , " Better now than later , " and then bawl out for somebody to be heating water , quick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had her sleeves rolled high , her blue , checked apron was spotted with blood . She went to the cabinet and took down several bottles . One was the chloroform bottle . Lucy knew then that they were going to cut the man 's arm off . She thought she could not stand it . She walked up and down the room , her shoulders hunched over , her hands pressed tight against her eyeballs . Then she heard a strangled cry from the bed . Captain Linton was sitting up . His head shook from side to side . His poor hands kept tearing at his throat . She went and sat on the edge of the bed and put her arms around him and caught both his hands and held them down . When he managed to get his right hand away from hers she caught it and held it in the vise of her knees until the spasm passed and he lay weakly back on his pillow . This hemorrhage had been worse than the last one . Her hands and her gown were sticky with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the pillow . She went out and got a basin of water and fresh linen and sponged his face  --  she did not dare touch his throat  --  and then as gently as she could slipped a fresh pillow case under his head . His neck as she lifted his head felt limp . She thought that perhaps he was dying and drew back with the wet cloth in her hand and then suddenly he opened his eyes and caught her hand and pressed it . When she would have taken her hand away it seemed to her that the limp fingers held on to it so she drew a chair close to the bed and sat beside him , holding his hand . In the other room the terrible loud groaning kept on . Once a man 's high voice cut across it . " Shut up , Joe ! They got to do it . " There was a cry after that more bestial than any of the others and then that too died away into a faint whimpering that might have been made by an injured dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room . She still sat there holding the man 's hand . After a while Molly came , bringing a candle and after her , walking heavily , the doctor . He knelt beside the bed but he did not touch the wounded man ; merely leaned forward and peered out of his bloodshot eyes that had heavy pouches under them . Once he put out a stubby forefinger , seemed about to touch the man 's throat , but the finger came back and he got to his feet , shaking his head . " In a coma now , " he said . " Morphine wo n't do any harm , " and he got out his hypodermic syringe and showed Lucy how to give the injection in the fleshy part of the forearm . " You might have to do it again and you might not , " he said wearily and was gone from the room.  |p217Mitty  came . She said that she had already eaten and would stay with the captain while Lucy ate . Lucy went into the diningroom and got a piece of cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk but when she swallowed a piece of the cornbread it felt harsh in her throat and she put the rest of the pone down and went back into the bedroom . Mitty had lit a candle on the mantel shelf . She was standing beside the bed , looking down at the soldier . He was lying as Lucy had left him on his back . His wide-open eyes appeared to contemplate the ceiling , but the lower part of his face was contortedand blood oozed from the gaping mouth down on to the pillow . Lucy bent over him a moment then looked up at Mitty . " He 's dead , is n't he ? " " I do n't know , " Mitty said helplessly . " I was just standing by the window and I heard a little sound , not anything like he made at first and I turned around and saw all that blood ... . Lucy , what ought we to do ? " " Nothing , " Lucy said . She looked abstractedly at the candle flame , then as if with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the negro girl , staring in the doorway . " Molly , bring me a basin of water . " Mitty held the candle and Lucy washed the soldier 's face and hands . She would have turned away when she had finished but Mitty still stood irresolute . " We ought to shut his eyes , " she whispered . " I ca n't , " Lucy said harshly , then she knelt down beside the bed and with her finger tips stroked the eyelids shut . One of the soldier 's hands was clenched at his side . She straightened the fingers and then brought both hands up and crossed them on his chest . Mitty would have pulled the sheet up over his face but Lucy stopped her . " Let 's do n't do that now . " " All right , " Mitty said . Lucy looked at her and saw that she was trembling all over . " You 'd better go to bed , " she told her . They left the room . Mitty went upstairs to bed . Lucy said that 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the porch . Behind her the house was quiet except for an occasional footfall on the stair or in the hall . Old Rivanna had finished washing up in the kitchen and she and Molly were moving slowly along the path to the quarter . Lucy could hear old Rivanna 's weary grunt as she stepped over a stick of stovewood that somebody had left in the path and then their voices died away and everything was quiet again . She sat down on one of the benches that ran along either side of the porch . Now that she was still she realized that her feet and legs , even her arms ached . There was a dull ache too at the base of her neck . She laid her head down on her folded arms but when she shut her eyes she kept seeing pictures : a man jumping his horse across a gulley , the first spiral of smoke over the poplars , a stern face under a black felt hat . . . . She raised her eyes . The three days ' old moon rode high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The field that stretched away on this side of the house was bathed in light . There was a place on the nearer edge where the pearly blades of grass were all trampled . The Confederate soldiers jumping their horses over the fence had landed there . Somewhere , not many miles from here , the stern-faced major , father to the boy in there on the bed dead , was still riding . Her lips trembled . If she thought of him she would cry . But she had no tears for the young captain . It seemed to her that he had died a long time ago . It seemed to her too that she had known him a long time . There was something about him that reminded her of George Rowan . Or was it that the night itself reminded her of George ? She remembered a night  --  it was long ago before George had ever thought of falling in love with her  --  when he and she had ridden home from Sycamore by moonlight . In late summer  --  it must have been because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and a moon so full that every little leaf on the roadside bushes was picked out in silver light . George had ridden in silence a while , his eyes roving thep219fields as if he did not want to miss any of it . Then he turned to her and began reciting : " On such a night as this . . . " She laughed to cover her embarrassment but he went on : .... When the sweet wind did gently woo the trees And they did make no noiseTroilus , methinks , mounted the Trojan wallAnd sighed his soul toward the Grecian tents Where Cressid lay . . . " She laughed again  --  pert child of fifteen  --  and asked him who Cressid was this summer . He looked at her . His eyes were dark under the shadow of his broad-brimmed hat . There was an expression on his mobile lips she had never seen before . He said gently : " Little Lucy . You do n't know anything about that , do you ? Well , you will some day ... " She got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As she rose she felt the sharp edge of Rives ' letter which she had folded and thrust into the bosom of her gown . This one had come yesterday : " . . . I went out reconnoitering this morning and saw the enemy 's position . Tomorrow we cross Lookout mountain and will , I suppose , make directly for the Tennessee River . It will be strange to be so near home and yet so far away . I have no expectation of any leave nor would I feel entitled to one at this juncture ... " She laid her head down on the railing . Her body shook with sobs so that she had to put her hands out and grasp the wood to steady herself . There were steps in the hall . Susan came out on to the porch . She stood there and sighed , the deep sigh of physicalexhaustion . Lucy moved on the bench . Susan heard her and turned . " Is Captain Linton dead ? " she asked in a low voice . Lucy nodded without raising her head from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood beside her . She put out an awkward hand , touched her shoulder . " Do n't cry , child . He 's better off . "  | Lucy raised her head and looked at her mother-in-law out of eyes heavy with unshed tears . She cried out wildly : " I 'm not crying for him ! " and again as Susan fell back , startled , " I 'm not crying for him ! "  | THE horse shambled on through the dust then came to stop where a post oak threw its shadow across the road . The negro girl stepped up with her stick , then seeing howlow he held his head , turned back to Lucy . " We better let him rest a while , " she said ; " it ai n't on the cyards he gwine git to that cane brake . " " All right , " Lucy said . She sat down on the bank . The horse , as if knowing that he had been the subject of conversation , moved deeper into the shade . He stood with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they almost locked together . Rumblingscame from his gaunt belly . Lucy looked at him and looked away . She had come in the last few weeks almost to hate him . He was starving . The Yankees had taken all the corn long ago , of course . There had been pasture in the early summer , but that was gone too , a month ago . This beast  --  Cousin Susan had found him one day strayed on the road , a great sore half hiding the letters US branded on his hip  --  this horse and Uncle Mack 's mule were the only two work animals on the place now . They had subsisted for weeks on the sparse grass and the clover found in fence corners . Uncle Mack 's mule had died a few days ago of blind staggers . There was only this horse left . She thought of horses she had known long ago . Cholera and Crevasse had been brought to the same pass as this wretched creature . The Yankees had stolen them . They had stayed away for months and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw them standing , their heads hanging over the gate . She went screaming into the house : " Mama , two old horses out here . " Fontaine Allard went out , looked at the piti- ful creatures , then with a glance over his shoulder for spying negroes , said : " Drive these old horses off . No telling what diseasesthey 've got . " Uncle Winston had driven them off to the pen in the woods . They had been there for two months , had got fat and sleek again , but had never got over being wary . Cally wrote that they would stand without moving a muscle if any alien step came near , but that they knew Grandpa 's and Winston 's step and whinnied when they heard them coming . No , it was Grandma who had written that . Cally , when she wrote , always pretended that Grandpa was the same as ever . But Grandma was kind and wrote more frankly , " I am so glad the horses are back . Your Pa is more like himself when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the next to the last letter . She had not had any letters from anybody at Brackets now for over a month . She got up . Molly had shooed the horse on and they moved forward a little faster . They were approaching the swamp and the shade along here was dense . Even the dust of the road was cool . Lucy felt the gritty particles sifting in through the loose fastenings of her brogans . She looked down at her own feet contemptuously . She walked like a field hand and a slew-footed one at that . But it was necessary to fling her foot out each time she raised it . Keeping these brogans on was a task in itself . Uncle Mack had made them for her out of hog-skin when the hogs all died of the cholera . They had all been very excited when the first supply of homemade hides was brought to the house . Uncle Mack had showed great resourcefulness in the tanning . He made a vat by digging a hole in the ground near the spring . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with lint cotton to keep the tan-ooze from escaping . Then the long strips of red oak bark had been put in , a layer of bark and then a layer of hide . It took three months but the leather on first inspection was as soft and pliable as any you had bought before the blockade . The swine leather , however , turned out to be too large pored . The shoes started out all right , but after you had worn them a day or two they spread out flat , like the ones she had on.  |p223They  had come to the edge of the swamp . The odor of cool , festering vegetation was heavy in the air . The horse smelled it and went forward at an awkward run . Molly let her stick fall . " We 'll jest let him go , " she said . " He can be filling hisself up whilst we 're picking . " She handed Lucy one of the tow sacks she had folded under her arm and the two women began stripping the leaves off the cane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their shoulders . When they had stripped all the cane on the edge they moved farther into the brake , stepping from one tussock to another . Once Lucy made a misstep and her foot slipped into the black slimy water . She took her shoes off after that and went barefoot thinking that in this way her footing would be surer . Molly was adventurous and penetrated farther and farther into the swamp . Lucy tried to keep up with her but she could not pick as fast . Her great sack was only three-quarters full . They reached a place where the cane was thick as grass . Molly exclaimed in pleasure . They set to work picking as fast as they could . Molly 's sack and the sack they would put on the horse 's back were full . She had come to stand near Lucy and was reachingover and putting handfuls of cane into her sack when they heard something moving in the brake . The negro girl began to jump clumsily from one clump of grass to the other . Lucy stood her ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside of the brake they stood breathless waiting for the sound to come again . It did not come , but the negro girl had already started walking rapidly away over the field . Lucy started after her then turned . She could see the road stretching away , a good two miles home . They could not go back without as much fodder as they could carry . They would have to come back soon enough as it was . She called : " Molly ! " The girl paused and stood looking at her . Lucy called again peremptorily . The girl came sullenly and they went back into the swamp . They stood on adjoining tussocks and picked as fast as they could . They did not hear the sound again but they were expecting to hear it any minute . Lucy told herself that it was not a wandering negro or marauding cavalry , only some wild animal or perhaps a horse , strayed just as " Yankee " had been straying when they found him . She told herself that and yet all the time she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking out at her from the thicket . She stripped the stalks with nervous , fumbling fingers . Sweat stood on her forehead . She felt faint inside . Molly gave a grunt of satisfaction . Lucy 's sack was full . They made their way out of the brake . In the field Lucy bent to pick up her shoes where she had left them . In the effort to put them on she lost her balance and , struggling to regain it , slipped and fell on her back . She tried to rise but the great sack was stuffed so tight with cane that it would not bend . The negro girl was coming to assist her . Her face had been sullen with fear but a grin broke across it now . Lucy , lying on her back as if strapped to a mattress , her feet kicking in the clumsy shoes , laughed too , not merrily , but grimly , as she fancied a hyena would laugh.  | GENERAL HILL dismounted at the gate and threw his horse 's reins to an orderly . As he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path to the little house was neatly kept , edged with broken bottles , and over to the right was a round bed of larkspurs and bleeding hearts . He had noticed that all these mountain cabins had about them some attempt at adornment . The region was not so wild as he had expected to find it . A woman in black , who was weeding one of the borders in the corner of the yard , rose up suddenly and turned a startled face upon him . The widow , doubtless , to whom the house belonged . The General bowed formally and touched his hat to her before she scuttled around a corner of the house . When the young staff officer behind him laughed he shook his head reprovingly . " I pity these poor people , Faulkner . It is a terrible thing to be invaded by the military . " He went slowly on up the path . He was thinking of the last time he had sat in the yard of a domestic dwelling . It had been a house in the suburbs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the poet . They had been sitting there , three or four gentlemen on a hot day , glasses in hand , when President Davis , in a suit of plain gray and attended by a small escort in brilliant uniform galloped up . His Excellency would not get off his horse . He called Hill over to the fence , began speaking , rapidy : " Rosecrans is about to advance upon Bragg . I have found it necessary to detail Hardee to defend Mississippi . Bragg 's old corps is without a commander . I wish you to command it . " Hill was startled . He thought : " 1 can not leave Virginia . "  | Aloud he sparred for time . " How can I do that ? General AlexanderStewart ranks me . " There was a curious smile on the President 's face . " I can cure that by making you a lieutenant-general . Your papers will be ready tomorrow . When can you start ? " That was on the thirteenth of July and on the nineteenth he had reported to General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed strange to address his old messmate as " General . " He had not seen Braxton since the old days together in Texas . In 1845 that was . He had been the junior lieutenantof Bragg 's battery . The other two lieutenants were John Reynolds  --  and a damned good man he turned out to be  --  and George Thomas . Reynolds had been killed at Gettysburg . Thomas was Rosecrans ' corps commander in the battle which would certainly take place within the next few days . Strange for him to have taken the Yankee side . In the old days he had been the most ardent , the most pronounced Southerner of the lot . He had arrived at the steps . Two or three officers fell aside to let him pass . He went through the narrow hall and entered the room to the right . It was crowded . The commanding general sat at a small table , writing . McCall , his chief of staff , bent over him . The other commanders , Buckner , Walker , Johnson and Bishop Polk sat in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go around . Half a dozen staff officers were backed up against the wall . A young officer was bringing a chair . Hill , smiling , indicated that it should be placed next that of General Polk . He sat down . The bishop shook hands with him cordially and included him in the conversation he was having with Buckner . " General , we have been talking of your great brother-in-law , Stonewall Jackson , of his habit of sucking lemons when he wanted to do some hard thinking . " Hill laughed . " Jackson was a man of many idiosyncrasies . I remember once he told me he never ate black pepper ; it made his left leg ache . "  |p227The  bishop laughed too . " I know a man , Colonel Cyrus Sugg , who always goes into battle smoking his pipe . I asked him once if it was n't inconvenient . He said it would be more inconvenient to be without it . His mind , he says , does not function when there is no tobacco in his system . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , General Buckner ? " Buckner smiled but only with his lips . On the other side of him Walker and Johnson were conversing in tones that they kept almost too low . There was tension in the atmosphere . Buckner felt it and so did Polk for all his casual talk . Hill looked at Buckner . The four men sitting there in those chairs would be corps commanders in the battle that impended and two of them had already experienced a perplexing , if not an ignoble defeat . Buckner and Bushrod Johnson had both been in high command at the siege of Fort Donelson . Johnson , he had heard , had conducted himself admirably . Floyd , the senior commander , had undoubtedly been most to blame . He was in a hurry to get away because , being under indictment by the Yankee government , he feared capture . Buckner had behaved better than either Floyd or Pillow . He had at least been willing to assume the command they were in a hurry to get rid of . Hill studied the man 's handsome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him . Why had he given up the fort ? By all accounts a victory had been won , almost a great victory . No telling what turn affairs might have taken if Fort Donelson had been held against the enemy . Bragg raised his head from the papers he was studying . The young staff officers stood suddenly aside as if to disclose him to the other generals . He had not seen Hill until that moment and he rose at once , came forward and shook hands . Hill was about to make some reference to their young days together but something in Braxton 's expression deterred him . He took his seat silently . Bragg was bending over his papers again . Hill 's eyes were held by the gloomy face . A foreboding ran through him . This was the man whose appointment to commandhad sent the South wild with hope . Well , Bragg 's invasion of Kentucky had been a failure . He had not been able to drive Buell from the country . Worse than that he had allowed him to take possession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and supplies . The battle of Stone 's River had been a barren victory . Bragg 's retreat after the battle , his subsequentfalling back to Chattanooga had seemed , when viewed from Richmond , the advisable , the military procedure . " Chattanooga , " as he had informed the war office in many dispatches , " was the natural stronghold and storehouse of the South . " But Bragg had not been able to hold Chattanooga . Rosecrans had cleverly manoeuvered him out of the town and now here he was with his army strung out all the way from here to Lafayette , Georgia . It would not be so bad if you only knew what Rosecrans was doing . But there was a depressing lack of information at Bragg 's headquarters . He had no well-organized system of independent scouts such as Lee had . For information in regard to the enemy he evidently trusted alone to his efficient cavalry . The failure to attack Negley 's division in the cove on September loth had been due to his ignorance of the position of the enemy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hindman , but it was possiblethat Hindman knew his commander and realized that Bragg did not really intend him to attack . All day on the eleventh Hill 's own signal corps and scouts had reported the march of a heavy column to the left and up the cove , but Bragg would not credit the reports . He remembered something that Bragg had said to him when they first met  --  after fifteen years separation  --  in Chattanooga earlier in the summer . " They say it 's easy to defend a mountainouscountry , but give me fighting in the open every time . A mountain is like a wall full of rats . They lie at the holes and pop out when you are not watching . Who can tell what lies behind that wall ? " And he had pointed to the blue Cumberland range across the river . His lack of information about the enemy 's movements had kept him in a nightmare of indecision for a week now . Well , hep229seemed to have come to a decision at last . He was on his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gaunt head , went for a second from face to face as if he were asking himself whether the man before him were friend or enemy . " The plan of battle , " he said impressively and began to read in a jerky , excited voice. " i . ( Bushrod ) Johnson 's column ( Hood 's ) , on crossing at or near Reed 's Bridge , will turn to the left by the most practicable route , and sweep up the Chickamauga toward Lee and Gordon 's Mills. " 2 . Walker , crossing at Alexander 's Bridge , will unite in this move and push vigorously on the enemy 's flank and rear in the same direction. " 3 . Buckner , crossing at Tedford 's Ford , will join in the movement to the left , and press the enemy up the stream from Polk 's front at Lee and Gordon's. " 4 . Polk will press his forces to the front of Lee and Gordon 's Mills , and if met by too much resistance to cross will bear to the right and cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be necessary , and join the attack wherever the enemy may be. " 5 . Hill will cover our left flank from an advance of the enemy from the cove , and , by pressing the cavalry in his front , ascertain if the enemy is reenforcing at Lee and Gordon 's Mills , in which event he will attack them in flank. " 6 . Wheeler 's cavalry will hold the gaps in Pigeon Mountain , and cover our rear and left , and bring up stragglers. " 7 . All teams , etc. , not with troops should go toward Ringgold and Dalton beyond Taylor 's Ridge . All cooking should be done at the trains ; rations when cooked will be forwarded to the troops. " 8 . The above movements will be executed with the utmost promptness , vigor and persistence . " The aides came forward , put a copy of the battle order before each commander . They studied it in silence . Bragg , leaning back in his chair , tapped on the table with a pencil , spoke finally : " General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Admirable  --  and practicable , " Hill said slowly . He was thinking that if this order had been issued on any of the four preceding days it might have found Rosecrans wholly unprepared . Now there was no telling . The same thought was evidently in Buckner 's mind . He said : " All right , provided the enemy does n't get in our rear . " Bragg eyed him coldly . " Have you any reason to believe that the enemy is in our rear ? " Buckner was looking at Hill . Hill spoke up . " General Buckner is referring , I think , to reports received by my signal corps . " Buckner nodded . " Lieutenant Baylor reported three nights ago that McCook was encamped at Alpine . " Bragg was enraged . " Lieutenant Baylor lies ! " he cried excitedly . " There is not an infantry soldier of the enemy anywhere to the south of us . " Buckner stared at him , then shrugged his broad shoulders . " Perhaps Lieutenant Baylor is mistaken , " he said finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to attack . " Bishop Polk was on his feet , evidently anxious to quit the conference as soon as possible . " General Buckner is quite right . An engagement is called for . " He advanced to Bragg , extended his hand . " An admirable plan , General . I feel convinced of victory . . . . When does General Longstreet arrive ? " " Tomorrow night , " Bragg said . They were all rising . Walker lingered to ask the commanding general some question . The others , handshakes exchanged , were filing out on to the porch . Hill found himself moving down the walk beside Bishop Polk . The " fighting bishop " gave a long sigh then turned to Hill . " The temper of the troops has demanded a battle for some time now . General Bragg is quite right , in my opinion , to precipitate the engagement . " Hill did not answer . He was thinking of Sharpsburg . The bitterness of death had passed with him long ago , even before the great reverses . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fight again . He concentrated his gaze on the scene in front of him : a wooded slope reaching down to a little river . Those wooded slopes stretched for miles around to formp231the great shallow basin of the Chickamauga . An arena , as Sharpsburg had been , only it was dark woods instead of fields of grain . They had reached the gate . The water of the river could be seen glinting through the black tree trunks . The bishop waved his hand . " Beautiful country , General . It once belonged to the Cherokees . There is a legend that they made their last stand here in this valley . " Hill inclined his head courteously . " Indeed ? Chickamauga , I presume , is an Indian name . " The bishop was gathering up his reins . " Yes , it means the river of blood . ' "  | HENRY DUN B A R was thirteen years old on the nineteenth of September , 1863 . On the night before his birthday he slept as usual in the loft of his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawn he was aroused by his mother 's shrill cry : " Henree ! Batter bread ! " Henry rolled over in bed , stretched , opened one eye and gazed at the rafters . He knew that it took batter bread twenty minutes to bake . He knew also from long experience that it would take him all but two of those twenty minutes to milk the three cows waiting for him in the stable lot . But this morning he would have a helper . His cousin , Bud , from over on Long Branch , was spending the night . Bud expected to share in the pleasures of the day ; he could n't in decency refuse to help milk . Henry made another swift calculation , rolled over on his side and went back to sleep . A few minutes later the call came again . Years ago Mrs. Dunbarhad called , " Batter bread 's in the oven . " Now she simply shrieked the word " Bread ! " as she passed from back porch to kitchen . Henry , subconsciously on the alert , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretching , drew on his pants . As he started for the , ladder he passed the cot where Bud lay swathed in quilts like a cocoon . Bud 's big toe was protruding from the quilts . Henry leaned over , swiftly gave it a vicious jerk . " Ai n't you going to help me milk ? " he called plaintively from the head of the ladder . Bud gave no answer save a groan , but the question lingered inp233the air , brought him finally upright in bed . " Hey ? " he muttered , then seeing Henry 's pallet empty he got up , dressed , and after a dash at the washbasin on the back porch went out to the cowpen . His mind , too , was busy with arithmetical calculation . It was ten miles to Porter 's Ford where the boys intended to spend the day fishing , and there was only one horse . Be just like Henry to make him walk if he did n't help milk . In the cow-pen Henry squatted on his haunches . His head was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dirty hands moving rhythmically brought the milk down in an even white flow into the bucket . Bud , rubbing his eyes and yawning , looked at the cow next to Bell . A little , hardly grown heifer with a bag that he mentally likened to a dried apple . It occurred to him that a person looking at the little old dried-up thing could n't tell whether she 'd been milked or not . He looked away . " Want me to let down the bars ? " he asked with false geniality . Henry turned his head so that one irate eye had Bud in its field of vision . He met deceit with sarcasm . " That 's right , " he ejaculated . " Let the bars down . Git ' em all stompeded before I 'm through milking . . . . " He broke off , realizing that he did not have an audience . Bud , unruly for once , had already started to the corner of the lot where movable bars served as a rude gate . His hand was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about to lay it on the ground when he stopped and stood erect , his hand cupped to his ear in a gesture which Henry considered ludicrously imitative of a grown person . Henry picked his bucket up , squatted down beside the cow he had hoped to get out of milking . " What 's the matter ? " he enquired as he dug his head into her flank . " Hear the sap running ? " Bud did not answer . The bar had fallen from his hand . He stepped around it and going out into the road , disappeared behindsome bushes . The next minute he was coming back around the clump of sumac , on the dead run . " Soldiers ! " he gasped . " Millions of ' em ! "  | Henry upset his milk bucket , rising , but he reached the fence at the same time Bud did . They hung there , staring as the noise emerged from the mist . A big man rode first on a gray horse . He looked queer to be at the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his coat collar from under a black slouch hat . A linen duster , such as Henry 's father wore to protect his Sunday clothes on long rides , was buttoned under his chin . The boys ' eyes passed swiftly over him . It was the man riding next who roused their astonishment , a great hawk with swinging beard who balanced ponderously in his saddle and beyond him a burly , fair man who rode with his legs dangling out of the stirrups . Behind these leaders rode four or five hundred men . The boys ' eyes slid over the long line , trying to pick out a face . They would have whispered to each other if they could have found breath . They would have said : these men are not soldiers . Both Henry and Bud had seen bodies of armed men . A regiment had come marching down the road through the dust a week ago , had broken ranks at the gate to spill over into the yard and to drink the cistern dry . One of them had gibed at little Laura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm a Yankee and I eat little children . Gal babies mostly , fried . " Somebody had yelled to him then , " Come on here , you fool , " and he had scurried off over the yard , turning to make the immemorial gesture of greasing the head , pinning the ears back , swallowing whole .... And there had been the impressive figure on the Widow Glenn 's front gallery just a few days ago . Stout legs in fine blue cloth were stretched out beneath the newspaper he was reading , and when he laid the paper down to stare off into the woods gold braid had showed , gold straps on his shoulders and splendid twisted snakes on his sleeves . " The head Yankee general , " their cousin Roswell had whispered before he pattered off down the road . But these men , moving secretly through the woods , were not soldiers . They were hunters , hunters who had chased the same quarry so long that they had come , all of them , to look alike . Their horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colorp235with mud , all kept the same gait . The men , boys of nineteen or burly majors , had the rigid slouch of the seasoned horseman . In their drawn , impassive faces only the eyes managed to be alert . A pair of those eyes , flat and black in a yellow face , seemed to be fixed on Henry now . Something squirmed coldly in the pit of his stomach . He put his hand down , softly felt the cool , hard rail that was between him and the cavalcade . But the eyes had moved on , were fixed on a point to the left of his shoulder . Henry staring into them saw a spark of light grow in the flat pupil . The man leaned over , said something to a comrade , who immediately turned a sharp face , muttered . But it was as if they had spoken to the horses , not each other . All along the line gaunt heads came up , tails flirted . They were suddenly moving down the road in a swinging trot . The last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mane . As the boys watched , his lean , burred tail rose , stretched out horizontally long enough to let three or four balls of manure drop down into the road . Then he , too , vanished into the cloud of dust . The boys looked at each other , sighed , slipped down from the fence . Bud was turning back toward the milking place but Henry had run around through the down pasture bars and was in the road and after a second Bud cautiously followed him . In the road the globes of manure lay , a greenish , disconnected snake that trailed through the dust . Henry put out his toe , poked one of the globes slyly . It was warm . " Them old horses , " he said mechanically , " been on grass too long . " He raised his face . There was a look on it with which Bud was familiar . That look had carried them into Bell 's Cave , past the buzzard droppings , past the dark branch , a mile farther than anybody else had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtly . They were off , pounding down the road almost as hard as the horses that had gone before them , raising , Henry thought proudly , almost as much dust . At the crest of the hill he veered , made for a wooded knob that swelled up suddenly at the side ofp236the road . Bud scrambled up behind him . They dropped to the ground and lay panting , their eyes fixed on the road . The cavalcade was still in sight . They had had to slow up for the hill and were moving slowly down the slope toward the ford . Henry and Bud could see beyond the black line of the creek the old sawmill , sedate in its hollow , the maple boughs making a scarlet lacework against its crumbling walls . The horsemen must be making for that . They would rest there , stable their horses .. . . Henry was on his knees suddenly , his thin hand scrunching Bud 's arm . " Hey , " he breathed . " Look ! " The gray walls of the old mill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They rose up from behind , rushed out from inside , were suddenly everywhere , a monster swarm of bees that clouded the slope and hummed angrily . The boys stared , then their eyes went to the road . The horsemenwere behaving oddly , leaping off their horses to vanish into the woods on either side . Some of them as they leapt threw their bridles to others and these men , holding eight or ten bridles at a time hurriedly began shepherding the horses back up the road . Shots began to ring out . The boys could see the cavalrymen moving up and down the slope or crouching behind trees to fire steadily . One of them was coming around the side of the knob . He wore a ragged straw hat and a canteen was slung over his shoulder . The upper part of his face was severe , expressionless , but his lips grinned away from yellow , parted teeth . He dropped to his knees behind the white trunk of a sycamore , rested the butt of his rifle on the ground while he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his mouth , was biting the end off when he heard Bud chattering in the grass like a doomed rabbit . His eyes looked amazedly into theirs for a second , then the lips drew away on each side of the greasy paper and one hand left the rifle , came up , thumb pointing imperiously over the shoulder . The next moment he flung the gun from him and plunged forward . The hand that had been pointing dug into the ground ,  |p237clutched  and dug again . His body twisted around . The boys saw the dark , spreading bullet hole , and then he was on his feet , comingtoward them . Blood trilled from his mouth and sprayed out on to his dusty front . He cried " Ulll ! " and pitched forward on his face . Henry sank his wiry fingers into Bud 's shoulder , hauled him to his feet . They were over the side of the knob , pelting down through the dead leaves and brambles . It seemed a long time before their bare feet struck the cool dust of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tin cup , tilted his head so that the last drops of coffee could run down his throat . His eyes were on the retreating back of the negro servant but he spoke to the young aide who had just come up to the fire . " That 's a valuable man of yours , Rowan . Want to sell him ? " George Rowan smiled . " No , sir , " he said respectfully and took advantage of the brief interchange to let his eyes rest on the General , taking in every detail of his appearance . Breckinridge sat on a fallen log , leaning a little backwards so that he could stretch out his legs to the flames . His breeches were soaked to the knee with dew  --  he had been riding about through the undergrowth since early dawn  --  but above the waist he presentedhis usual , trim soldierly appearance , dark butternut blouse buttoned to the chin , his long moustaches sprightly , and the eyes in the swarthy face as bright and glancing as a squirrel 's in a thicket . He turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fire , resumed his animated discussion of yesterday 's fight . " They were on the run then . Right after we drove Negley off . In my opinion that would have been the time to attack the right . " Deshler nodded . " At Lee and Gordon 's Mills , " he said thoughtfully . " You and Cleburne could have flanked them out of there in no time . " Breckinridge 's remarkable eyes flashed assent . " The two handsomest , most soldierly-looking men in the army . " George , watching the two , mentally added the words to the letter that reposedp239at that moment in his pocket . Since one of his letters had been published in the Tobacco-Leaf he wrote home often , now to this member of the family , now to that . The letters , which would be carefully preserved , contained in molded phrases his impressionsof the great whom he had seen since he had become Deshler'saide . " Vignettes " he had come to call them : " Longstreet ... has a broad face that at first glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes three rounds of cannon to get him steamed up . . . . D. H. Hill , not so impressive as his great brother-inlaw , *but soldier all through . . . . Cleburne , pugnosed , fiery yet kindly eyes , true Irish , one of the best tacticians in the army . . . . " He smiled , thinking of a phrase he had written in last night 's letter about " one who threatens to become great also . They all say Zack makes the best coffee of any nigger in camp . I am afraid he is growing too big for his breeches . He says tell you all he is taking good care of me but we lives like jack rabbits out in the bushes .... " General Breckinridge got to his feet and straightening his shoulders walked over to where an orderly was holding his horse . General Deshler still sat beside the fire . He had been gay enough a few minutes ago , laughing and joking with the young officers as was his custom , but his attitude now was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awed by his stern expression , suddenly recalled that this was his chief 's first engagement as a general officer . He got up , walked off a little way through the trees . As he went his mind was busy with more phrases that he would put in his next letter . " This morning , ' yesterday morning it would be by the time he got a chance to write a letter , your humble servant was sitting around the fire in the company of four generals ' . . . " Yes , Cleburne had been there too when Hill rode up . Hill 's face was lined with fatigue , his scrubby beard hung in stiffened wisps . His deep-set eyes lightened when he caught sight of Breckinridge and Cleburne by the fire . He called out almost angrily that he had ridden half the night , that there.  | had been no couriers at the bridge to which he had been directed . Did either of them know where in the name of the Almighty the commanding general had moved his headquarters to ? CaptainWheless had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought the order was for him and he put out his hand , but the courier said : " These orders are for General Breckinridge and General Cleburne . " Breckinridge had read his order , then handed it to Hill . Hill read it , pulling savagely at his beard . " They ca n't go in now , " he said , " there 's been no proper reconnaissancemade . " He raised his head , glared at the other two . " Those lines will have to be adjusted . Cheatham 's whole division is at right angles to my line now . " Breckinridge nodded . " My wagon trains are n't up yet , " he said in his deep voice . " Some of my men have n't eaten in forty-eight hours . " George wished he could remember what else Hill had said before he swung up into his saddle , but the words of the great , he reflected , were surprisingly like those of ordinary mortals in the moment of utterance . Anyhow , the battle which had seemed imminent would be delayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another surprise attack . They could not be far off . You could hear them felling trees for fortifications all night . He had advanced to a place where the sound of axes was as sharp , as insistent as the chatter of squirrels . He stood very still and looked through the aisles of the trees . They said that an Indian tribe had waged its last desperate battle here and had given the river its name . Well , these woods , sombre even in autumn , looked as if they would always harbor an enemy . It was only strange that he remained so long hidden . He stooped , picked up a stick and threw it at a squirrel . His mind left the impending conflict , went back to yesterday afternoon when he had seen his cousin , Rives Allard , for the first time in two years . He had been standing at the counter of a country store there by the bridge when somebody had called out , " Hey ! Orderly out here looking for Lieutenant Rowan . " He had gone out expecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Rives on a little bony yellow mare . He was on his way to Reed 's bridge , he said , but had heard somebody say " Tenth Texas " and stopped . He had not even known that George was with the Tenth Texas until the week before when somebody at home had written him the news . " Well , it 's a damned good regiment , " George said . He had thought as they stood there grinning at each other that it was strange how things fell out . He and Rives and Ned Allard had all set out from the same camp and here he and Ned were under Deshler , and Rives with Forrest . He had enquired tactfully if Rives had had a promotion and Rives had replied , still grinning , that it looked as if he would stay an orderly for the duration of the war . George knew what that meant . Those fellows , the men down on the lists as " orderlies , " were old Forrest 's hand-picked scouts . One of their best tricks was desertingto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had heard , had done that at Murfreesboro and would have paid with his neck if Forrest had n't captured the town that same night . Well , they were a dangerous lot , bold as the devil . They said old Forrest himself carried a sabre big enough for any two men and ground against all military regulations to a razor edge . A man in the Tenth had seen him whirl it in both hands and slice off a Yankee 's head as if he 'd been a gobbler on a block . CaptainBill Forrest , his brother , was no better than a guerrilla . They called his men " The Forty Thieves . " The younger brother , Jeffrey , was said to have something of the manner of a gentleman . God knows where he had got it . Old Forrest himself had been a nigger trader before the war . . . . Well , Rives Allard had always been a queer cuss . It was only natural that he should land in a queer branch of the service . For it was a queer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been killed in action when they had met ignominious deaths . He had heard dark stories . They had bungled the hanging of the boy spy , David Dodds , so that he had been choked to death . Two men in line had fainted at the sight , and the Yankee officer in charge of the execution had wept . A man 's country had the right to demand his life but had she the right to demand more  --  to demand that he be dishonored in death ? He did n't know that he would have the stomach for it and yet  --  he suddenly saw himself as he must appear to his comrades  --  he was accounted a brave man . He raised his head . " I am willing to give my life for my country , " he said proudly . The words spoken in the quiet woods rang a little theatrically on his ear yet evoked a sudden , immediate sense of beauty . He recalled fox-hunting nights when still fresh at dawn he had ridden home through wet woods , recalled other softer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was on the verge of making a conquest that most people would have said even he could n't make . Love itself never had a moment to match that feeling . The last night riding home from Brackets with Lucy Churchill .... It was the first time a woman had ever refused him . And yet though he was in love with Lucy at the moment he had not suffered . It was as if he knew that he was soon to be caught up into greater affairs ... . Off to the right a bugle fluted silverly . Ta-Ta-Ta-Ta ! There was the sound of trampling feet . He realized that he had been away five or ten minutes . As he ran back to the camp fire he was thinking that after the war was over and he had leisure he might collect his impressions into a book . " In Tent and Saddle " might do for a title or perhaps " Bugle and Bayonet " would be better . He might even look up the Indian legend , put in something about " the bloody river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men hadall got their ration of cooked beef and cold pone . They ate standing , in an irregular battle line . Some of them occupied the same ground on which they had slept last night . It was littered with empty cartridge boxes , belt buckles , playing cards , here and there a rifle that had not been gathered up . The fighting had been hot in this part of the field . There were other souvenirs of battle . The stiffened body of a fair-haired , bluecoatedfarm boy lay at the foot of a mound just back of the lines , and another dead Yankee was propped up against a tree a hundred yards away , his gun resting across his knees . One of the men , still chewing , stepped out of line and absent-mindedly but expertly rifled the dead boy 's pockets . They yielded nothing but a piece of string and he got to his feet with a shake of the head for his own foolishness . As he stepped back to his place he gave a glance at the other dead Yankee . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been standing in line since daybreak . " The man next to him did not answer . He had long ago wolfed down his bread and meat and stood gazing straight ahead . You could not see far . A curious red fog enveloped all the trees and the smell of gunpowder was still in the air . The men , rising before daybreak , had expected to go straight into battle . Indeed it had seemed to them , moving in this red fog with the foul smoke thick in their nostrils , that they had only lain down long enough to rest between fights . But that had been several hours ago and the battle had not yet begun . There were rumors afloat . General Bragg in a plain uniform had been seen galloping back of the lines an hour ago . It wasp244said that he had gone to see why the battle had not begun , as he had ordered , at dawn . That was the interpretation some put on it . Others whispered that the plans for the battle had all gone wrong . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rear . Two men were talking in undertones of these matters when the would-be looter stepped back into line . One of them as he talked kept his eyes fixed on a knot of officers a few feet away . The big man on the bay horse was his own colonel . The other , more impressive figure that had just galloped up he surmised to be General Breckinridge himself . He cut short his companion 's complainings with a finger jerked over his shoulder and a laconic : " Well , looks like they going to do something now . " A moment later the captain of the company was in front of the line waving his sword and shouting , " Move forward , men ! " The lieutenants bustled about , straightening the line with parrot cries of " Dress on the right . Dress on the right ! " The regiment on the instant was transformed . Men straightenedup , gripped their rifles , went forward at a quick march . Eyes that had been vacant and staring glinted in grimy faces as stepping faster and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division unroll like mist moving over a field . They had progressed not a hundred yards into the woods when the command came to double-quick . A fool race it seemed , jumping over stumps and gullies and crashing through brambles and all the time no enemy in sight . They came to a little glade , a pretty spot where in a happier time a man might have stopped to rest . Much clearing had gone on here and only the nobler trees were left . The space between them was filled with blackberry thickets . In the deep shade the leaves were still green . A lank Tennesseean , an inveterate blackberrystraggler , saw a bunch of late berries hanging heavily , put out his hand as he ran and was cramming some into his mouth when the ground at his feet suddenly dislodged itself and broke into a million flying particles . The blackberries fell from the man 's hand . He stood , staring . Figures that a moment before had been running now lay on thep245ground in a variety of attitudes , as if a hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon a table . Some were perfectly quiet , some ceaselessly contorted their bodies and moaned . One man who had had his leg taken off at the knee lay and with bright , intelligent eyes regarded two officers who came riding upon the scene . These officers , a captain and his colonel , rode slowly and with apparent indifference among the bodies of the dead and dying . The colonel was looking at the Yankee barricade , a stout line of breastworks crowning a low ridge , clearly visible now through the eddying smoke . " Pretty well fixed up there , " he said . The captain 's eyes were as bright , as intent as those of the dying man at his feet . " Send ' em right up , sir ? " he asked cheerfully . The colonel nodded and the captain rode in among the men ands suddenly was bellowing . " All right , boys . Straight ahead now ! Get into ' em ! " Men who had been looking at one another as if wondering what to do next bent their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slight surging backwards then loud , indignant voices were heard . A handful of men broke from the ranks and rushed forward . Others followed . Soon the whole line was in motion up the slope . The Yankees greeted them with a storm of bullets . Some men fell under it , others dodged to the rear but most of them came on . One big corporal , running lightly ahead of the whole line , kept his head up like a man who finds exposure to the elements bracing and fired wildly into the air . They had reached the crest , were almost up to the breastworks . All along the Yankee line men were standing up or leaping on top of rails to fire down into blind , uplifted faces . One man who sat firing easily and steadily until the Confederates were upon him suddenly threw his rifle aside and quivering as if with rage hurled himself fifty feet down the slope . The big corporal , still in the forefront , looked over his shoul- der , saw his colors fluttering behind him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with clumsy intentness drove it into the interstices between two rails . He had straightened up , was looking about as if uncertain what to do next when a Yankee bashed his head in with a clubbed musket . There had been all this time a demoniac yelling that rose even above the screech of shells . The young captain had not realized that it came from his own men until it ceased suddenly . He looked about , saw that they were falling back , some men doggedly , others making for the rear at top speed . His mouth opened to roar at them , then almost as if without his volition it closed . He stood perfectly still in the midst of flying , cursing men , his eyes seeming to be fixed on a tall tree of beautiful proportions that crowned the opposite hill . Suddenly he was flying down the slope as fast as any of his men . They were eddying about a big oak tree . He rushed in among them , slashing with his sword , howling , " You got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and be mown down by canister ? " The men dodged backwards and forwards , melted away before him , sought the shelter of another tree . Two officers at the rear saw what he was about , bore down , grimacing and cursing . The men milled for a moment , then started up again . The first advance had been simultaneous , a wave of men that rolled up the slope . Now as they advanced more slowly individual posture and mental attitude was revealed . Some moved crouching like dogs that beaten know there is no turning hack . Others as they went hitched up their pants , tightened their belts , futile gestures that served only to show that they washed their hands of the affair . Here and there was to be seen the wry grimace , the sightlesseye of a man who knew that in an instant he would be killed . They went up slowly , reached the height again . Dead Yankees lay thick but others had sprung up to take their places . The newcomersfired with ease and fury , running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the slope . The Confederates doggedly sustained the fire and were pushingon when a battery was seen just moving into position wherep247the ridge turned . The arrogant gunners leaped from the still bouncing carriages , slid to their places and began sending round after round of grape into the surging mass of besiegers . Men fell thickly . Those who were left turned and ran at top speed for the foot of the slope . They passed the oak where they had been rallied for the second charge , pushed pell-mell through briar thickets and undergrowth to fall sobbing with exhaustion on the ground . The captain was there , leaning against a tree , drawing rasping breaths . As the men rolled apprehensive eyes toward him he jerked himself to his feet , went forward to salute the colonel who just then galloped up . Those men who were lying near heard the colloquy between the two , heard the young captain sob out disgustedly the colonel 's order : " General Hill says to hold this position and await fresh troops . "  | GENERAL DESHLER 'S heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were torn from his body by a shell that came ripping out of the woods at noon . George Rowan was with him when it happened . The Tenth Texas arrived on the ground they were to occupy at ten o'clock . It was a wooded ridge two hundred yards from the Yankee breastworks . Colonel Mills had dismounted and was running alongside of his men when they came up to the crest . Semple 's battery at the left of the ridge was still firing then . Mills swore savagely when he saw the gunners limber up and lash their horses to ride away . " They want us to hold it without artillery , boys . Well , we God damn will ! " A shell bursting ten feet below threw up a black geyser that covered him from his men 's sight . He emerged , wiping his face free of cinders and ordered the men to fall back a little and fire lying down . Then he went down the hill , still swearing , to see if he could get Douglas ' battery up . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just within range of canister . But the grape was the worst . Under it men dodged backward and forward like jack-in-the boxes , or plastered themselves to the hill so tight that only the upward reaching of the arm told the living from the dead . Toward noon the Texans ' supply of ammunition ran low . George was lying behind a stump trying to pick off a Yankee gunner when he felt a hand on his shoulder , and Mills told him to go find General Deshler and tell him the ammunition was giving out.  |p249George  plunged down the hillside through a cloud of hot smoke just in time to see his little mare break her tether and go snorting off . He cut a horse loose from a captured gun , mounted , and using part of a rope trace as his riding whip rode off in search of Deshler . The young brigadier was sitting his horse beside a clump of sumac bushes . Two of his staff officers were with him . Hearne was telling the General that the place was too exposed , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ridge as Rowan was giving the message . It was perhaps the sight of a man who suddenly fell sidewise from behind a stump , spreadeaglingas he fell that decided him not to ask a staff officer to risk his life up there . He had half turned to Hearne when he shook his head and murmuring something  --  George thought it was " Ca n't send that boy "  --  rode off at a gallop . He went so fast that George on his winded horse had trouble in keeping up with him . It was hotter now than it had been a few minutes ago . And Mills did not seem to be in the place where he had left him . Or was it that the place itself had changed , with the black geysers springing up everywhere , keepingthe very ground under your feet in motion ? The fire and brimstone Aunt Charlotte 's preacher talked so much about , he thought , and he dodged his horse desperately through the smoke , trying not to lose sight of Deshler . Deshler 's big back was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oak a few feet away . George 's horse danced and George swayed involuntarily far to the right . When he came up Deshler was out of the saddle and flat on the ground . George looked down , saw the red sponge that had been Deshler 's chest . He got off his horse , put his hands to his face and cried out . It seemed a long time before men came running with stretchers . Mills was standing there as they carried Deshler 's body off . He would not look . His face was black as a fiend 's with powder and he kept shouting to men who were so far up the hill that they could not hear him . " Ammunition out ? Get up and bay'net ' em then ! "  | Rowan tethered his horse to a sapling and followed Mills back into the fight . The men were down to their last round now . George ran about over the field gathering up cartridge boxes from the dead and wounded . He had just taken a pistol from a dead Yankee when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saw Ned Allard in a hand-to-hand struggle with a Yankee . George ran a few steps forward then stopped . He passed a hand before his forehead to clear his sight . Ned 's arm was locked around the Yankee 's body but above that arm George could see blue cloth . He levelled the pistol barrel , took careful aim . The hammer clicked . George threw the pistol away and ran on . He was within a few feet of the combatants when a bullet from a sharpshooter 's rifle hit him . He fell , then after a second got up and staggered forward . The Yankee soldier had hit Ned over the head with the butt of his musket and was dragging him off the field . Ed Johnson coming up saw only George staggering and ran forward to help him . George , who was suffering no pain , saw no sense to that and resisted , but he was suddenly unable to see and collapsed against his helper 's shoulder . When he came to himself he was being carried on a stretcher through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was still roaring . One of the bearers stumbled over a rock . The stretcher tilted forward . Mills ' red face , with the mouth stretched to an 0 under the straggling moustache , was for a moment within George 's field of vision . It seemed to him somehow not so red but he thought that was the smoke . He had forgotten about Ned . He did not know that he was ( lying . He was thinking of the captaincythat would be his tomorrow when he looked at his colonel and smiled before he was borne from the field.  |p251RIVES  rode to General Ector with a message at teno'clock . When he got back they had dismounted Armstrong 's men and were sending them in . He sat under a sycamore tree behind the lines and watched them stream past , a jostling mass of swinging arms and legs , faces that turned to grin , emit messages : " Tell him I 'll see him at sundown .. . Where 's Bill ? . . . Tell him I was looking . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whooping : " Well , boys , we 'll all meet at the hatter 's ! " Major Anderson had told Rives to wait under this tree so that he could be found if wanted . Messages had been going back and forth all morning , mostly to General Ector who had been uneasy first about his right , then his left flank . Old Bedford had reared up on his hind legs when Rives came sweating up with the last message . " Tell General Ector that by God I am here and will take care of both his flanks . " A private running by , hearing words not in his own vocabulary , had rolled white eyes admiringlyover his shoulder . Rives recalled the obscene phrase , grinned , turned his eyes to the front . The fog had come back , settled under the trees . The shells burst through it like something blooming . Armstrong'smen must be catching hell , but from here you could n't see a one of them . The battle existed only as sound . Riding back of the lines a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . Now he knew what the sound was  --  planks that kept clattering down continually from some great height . Armstrong 's men had gone in far to the right , but they must251 have worked over . They were bringing the wounded back on stretchers along this path . One man , strangely cocky , with his dead white face , had something red sticking out of his side . He waved his hand , shouted " Boys , when I left we were driving ' em , " then collapsed on the canvas . The bushes to the right parted . More wounded men taking the short-cut to the spring . The one coming now was on hands and knees , tongue lolling , a crawling dog with hanging what's-itsname . Rives got impatiently off his horse , went over and put his canteen to the lips that were freckled with little white blisters . The man drank with greedy , sucking noises then slithered over on his back . His features swam grayly with fatigue then his mouth puckered . He might have been going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 're Allard , " he wheezed and when Rives nodded . " Your  --  pardner out there . ... Better get him . " Rives dragged the man off the path into the bushes , went back to his mare . As he pulled a limb down , slip-noosed the bridle , he was thinking that she could stand or not just as she pleased . He knew whom the man meant : the scout , Ben Bigstaff . Ben had gone in at ten o'clock with Armstrong 's men . He had known earlier in the day that he was going to be put in the line and had fumed while he cooked breakfast . " I do n't like this close work . " The corners of his mouth were pinched . There had been a beading of perspiration on his forehead as he looked up , skillet in hand . The mist eddied , revealed a man crouching behind a tree firing steadily . Rives went up behind him . " You seen Ben Bigstaff ? " The man drew his sleeve over his black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Naw , I ai n't seen nothing but this . " And he patted his rifle slyly and was crouching again . Rives ran on . He was talking to himself . They had trained Ben Bigstaff , just as you train a bird dog or a beagle . Sent him out night after night to creep up on men in the dark , shoot them down . Ben had learned all that business but he had been as clean about it , as kindly as a seasoned hunter . He would shoot a picketp253clown in a flash but he would wait five or ten minutes , then crawl back to see if the man was dead . He himself , Rives knew , had always expected to go like that , picked off from behind a tree or shot down in some lonely field . But to be sent in , one of a squirming mass , to be mowed down by grape .. . It was not grape that had killed Ben . He knew that as soon as he passed the next tree , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed two men as it burst and in the same instant had dug one grave for them . There were two heads protruding over the edge of the crater . One would have been bald if shining , black particles had not been grained everywhere into the skin . Ben lay on his back , one hand upflung . Blood oozed from the corner of his mouth , but except for that his face had a wise , kindly expression . Rives ' eyes slid away , went to the man underneath . Matted , auburn hair on a ridged skull . An Alabaman they called Sloppy Jim . A thief and so dirty and lousy besides that nobody would mess with him . One hand was dug into Ben 's side . Strange to see the fingers clutching as if the man had died of a gunshot wound . He stooped and with one hand on Ben 's shoulder was about to turn the body over when he saw grimed into the pit the tangle of blackened skin , loose flesh , bloody bones . He sank back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He raised his eyes , glared at the trees whose foliage was veiled in dull smoke . These men whose flesh was so inextricably mingled must rest in the same grave . The planks had ceased clattering down from the height but there was a high wind keening in his head . " Judgment Day ... Till Judgment Day ... " Judge ! " he screamed , and , leaning forward , grinning , tore with his nails at the shining dirt until it sprayed in a fine black powder over the mangled bodies . " Steady , there . . . steady . . . " There was a hand on his shoulder . A russet , spurred boot was resting beside his grimy hand . He got to his feet . The young officer was winking back longp254lashes from eyes as light brown , as shallow as a heifer 's . " General Hill wants to see you . " Rives walked beside him to where a group of officers sat under a big oak . The man on the gray horse watched them coming , cast another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said perfunctorily , then his eyes went back to the front . The fog had lifted a little and from here you could see a body of men sweeping steadilyaround the Union left . The General watched them intently . He was shaking his head as men do when they wish to express bedazzlement . " Whose infantry is that ? " he asked abruptly . Rives was limp with fatigue , wet with sweat . " General Forrest'scavalry , sir , " he said dully . " I am one of his orderlies . " Into Hill 's blue , deep-set eyes came an intent look , the expression of a child who is suddenly promised a treat . He said : " GeneralForrest ! I want to look at him . " One of the young officers was down off his horse and Rives was being pushed up into the saddle . They had to ride to half a dozen places before they found Forrest . General Hill caught sight of him before Rives himself did , and rode up promptly . He raised his broad-brimmed hat , inclined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , delivered in practised tones , cut through the battle roar , reached the other man 's ears : " General Forrest , I wish to congratulate you and those brave men moving across that field like veteran infantry . . . " The words droned on . " Magnificent behavior . . . . In Virginia I made myself unpopular . . . . Never saw a dead man with spurs on . . . Forrest turned . He wore no hat . His pistol belt was buckled over a linen duster that reached almost to his heels . His eyes , cold and gray , dwelt on Hill 's face for a moment . He raised his hand in brief salute . " Thank you , General . " He galloped off to take his position near Morton 's battery which just then was being advancedto the open field in front of Cloud 's Spring.  |p255LONGSTREET  and his staff were lunching on thesweet potatoes somebody had dug out of a field and roasted when the courier came with the message from the commandinggeneral . Longstreet snatched the potato which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rode off with two or three young officers . Bragg , surrounded by his staff , was waiting in the shade of a sugar tree . Although the day had grown warm he still wore gloves , but his thicket of beard was awry as if he had been pushing his hand through it , and it seemed to Longstreet that the dark eyes were vaguer , more luminous than usual . Bragg 's staff fell back as Longstreet rode up . The two Generalswere left confronting each other . Longstreet saluted , recitedformal phrases that had crystallized in his mind as he came along . The progress of the battle though slow was steady and satisfactory . Forty or more field pieces had been taken and a large number of small arms . The Yankee Twentieth and Twenty-First Corps had broken in disorder and were thought to be retreating through the pass of the Ridge by the Dry Valley road .. . Bragg kept nodding his head up and down . " Yes , General , yes . . . Very gratifying . " Longstreet suddenly felt the heat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collar , lifted his big chin to stare out over the field . As he had come along his mind had been busy with plans , but now he felt a desire to see the fighting for himself . Bright sunshine and a quiet field here , but out there a dense cloud of smoke . He could barely discern figures reeling through it in familiar , grotesque attitudes . He had suddenly a sense of time passing . The battle had gone on too long . He found himself speaking , with fury : " Breckenridge 's men have n't advanced six hundred yards from where they started and they went in at ten o'clock . " Bragg was startled , then he said , " But they are holding their own , sir . " Longstreet looked so directly into the luminous eyes that they focussed , gave him back his own hard stare . He said : " If you will give me enough troops to hold the ground we 've gained I can go down the Dry Valley road and cut Thomas off . " Bragg 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , freed themselves from Longstreet , fixed on a distant tree . He appeared to consider , raised a gloved finger judiciously to his lips . He shook his head . " General , there is no more fight left in Polk 's troops , in any of them except your own . You had better stay here and hold your position . . . . My headquarters are at Reed 's bridge . You can find me there if anything happens . " He had bowed ceremoniously , was riding off . Longstreet watched him go . As Bragg turned the corner of the fence , his staff jingling on behind him , Longstreet raised his gauntletedhands , smote the pommel of his saddle . He was still shaking with rage and cursing when Colonel Claiborne came up . " General Longstreet , your orders to Wheeler 's cavalry have been sent repeatedly but the cavalry is not riding . . . . " Longstreet raised a face still suffused with rage but with his little pig 's eyes twinkling . " Repeat the order in writing , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder , yelled jovially at his staff as they swung into the saddle to rattle off in a cloud of dust . His mind raced ahead to the front where his divisions already seemed moving up to do his will . He knew now what he was going to do . Bragg would not abandon his plan of battle ; then the left wing would have to get along the best itp257could . But he would order Johnson to make ready his own and Hindman 's brigades . Hood could join on the right . Pull Preston up from the river . Preston , Buckner , Hindman .... He would hurl them all in . Knock hell out of Thomas.  |p248AT  five o'clock General Thomas rode to the left of the Union line , leaving Major General Gordon Granger the ranking officer in the center . Granger stood on top of the ridge he had just carried . On the slope below , his men were still in line but flat on the ground , panting , most of them , like dogs . Fullerton , the only staff officer he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounded  --  sat bolt upright against a tree , his mouth open , his eyes glazed with exhaustion . He did not seem to notice that his right boot sole touched the outstretched hand of a dead Rebel . Granger walked over and looked at the man . About fifty , with prominent brown eyes under shaggy brows , clipped moustacheand heavy , sensual mouth . Some kind of lawyer or political leader at home , probably . It occurred to him that the man , except for the lack of beard , looked not unlike himself . He , who was regarded as the least self-conscious of men , had these moments in which he seemed to see himself as he appeared to others . It was perhaps that fragment of a letter he had once seen : " Granger , rough as a bear but with a good heart . . . inclined to insubordination . . . . " He laughed in his beard . They would n't say that any more . No , he could have just about anything he wanted after this engagement . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headquartershad been in a field far to the rear of the lines . He had been on top of a hay-stack , peering through glasses when he heard the roar of Polk 's artillery and discerned the great cloudp259of battle rolling up in the east . He had stood it as long as he could , until it seemed to him that Bragg must be piling his whole army on top of Thomas . He had jumped down then swearing that he would go to Thomas ' assistance , orders or no orders . Fullerton had followed him across the field , yelling something about court martial . But they had got the whole command , with the exception of McCook , on the road within twenty minutes . He and his escort had ridden far ahead to escape the dust . Hot as the devil by that time and the column sweeping along like a desert sandstorm . No wonder the Rebs had got wind of their approach . They had been waiting at a bend in the road , to open on the head of the column with three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did n't know . The usual rag-tag , bob-tail cavalry they looked , but they swarmed like hornets . He had had to throw his men into line of battle right there . It took two hours to break through and then on the double quick under a heavy fire from a battery and three sections of Napoleon guns . He had come onto the field , finally , near the house that Thomas had made into a hospital . The Rebels had held it since twelve o'clock . The wounded Union soldiers lying about on the ground cheered as they saw them making off through the woods . Thomas had sent a young staff officer to find out if the advancingcolumn were friends or foes . He had been fooled once that afternoon , sending the National flag forward to be greeted by a storm of bullets . The boy , as they rode along , jerkily gave news of the battle . The Rebels had been hammering on Thomas since ten o'clock . He had been forced out of his headquarters at the Widow Glenn 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line was forming . The fighting , the boy said enthusiastically , was as hot as ever he had seen . Bayonets being used  --  he had never seen a bayonet charge before  --  and men being killed and wounded with clubbed muskets . The pond where they had got water all morning was no good now , too full of blood . Thomas was sitting his horse back of some freshly thrown up26o None Shall Look Backp260entrenchments . His bearded face under the black slouch hat was as impassive as usual but his voice quivered as he shook hands . " General Granger ! Good God , sir , you arrive opportunely ! " The men had hardly got their breath before Thomas pointed to this place on which they now stood and asked if Granger could take it . Granger looked at it , a high ridge running nearly at right angles to Thomas ' line . He could see the Confederate divisions forming for assault , make out on the left the battery unlimbering for enfilading fire . He thought that they must have seen the colors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in readiness . He answered confidently that he could take the position , then laughed . " My men are fresh . Besides they are raw troops and do n't know any better than to charge up there . " He had sent Aleshire 's battery of three-inch rifled guns up to the left . Whitaker 's and Mitchell 's brigades had been put in the center . They had gone forward on the double-quick , cheering , through weeds waist-high . Halfway up the ridge the men had had to lie down for breath . When they started up again old Steedman was leading the way , a regimental flag in his hand . Five minutes later the Confederates had broken and were flying down the southern slope . The whole business had taken perhaps twenty minutes . He put up his hand , felt where his hat had been torn half off . Minie ball . Lucky escape . Steedman had been badly wounded , Whitaker perhaps mortally . The worst , though , was that the men were out of ammunition . When he had come up he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhaustedhis supply . The cartridge boxes of the dead and wounded enemy had long ago been rifled . Thomas as he rode off said he would send ammunition back . But where in the devil would he get it ? He thought of Thomas riding toward the left , finding always the same story . He knitted his brows . It was hard for him to get plans into his head . But he could see Thomas ' line as plainly as if drawn in diagram , horseshoe-shaped , but the ends of thep261horseshoe flattened in until they were in danger of touching each other . And yet Rosecrans had been sending reinforcements all day to this part of the line . He stood and scanned the woods in front of him , the woods into which the flying Rebels had disappeared . It was surprising how late the leaves stayed green even though it had been a dry August . He found himself picking out with relief the yellow , the scarlet branches that showed here and there . It was the depth , the continued greenness of those woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be back , at any minute . He turned sharply , hearing hoofs in the dead leaves . But it was not Thomas but Brannan riding up . Sweat stood in tiny globules on his fine , aquiline nose . He fixed Granger with angry blue eyes . " General , they are forming for another assault . " Granger glanced at the woods , nodded . " We have n't another round of ammunition left , " Brannan said despairingly . " Fix bay'nets and go after ' em then ! " Granger snarled . Brannan was off down the slope but two or three officers were bearing down from the other end of the ridge . One looked under Granger 's hat , was disconcerted not to find Thomas , emitted nevertheless his angry words : " My men . . . not another round , sir . . . . " Granger shook his head , seemed to push them away with his flattened palm , walked to the edge of the ridge , looked down . Officers were scurrying about , on foot and on horseback . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a turning everywhere , as if in sleep , arms working while legs remained immobile . In the little silence that he had made about him he looked again at the woods . He could hear far off a confused din but the leaves as yet were unstirred . It seemed a long time before the deep Confederate lines appeared  --  column of brigades at half distance . He noted approvingly the tactics even as he watched them spread out , swarm up the hillside in an angry flood . " Forward ! " had sounded below . The men were on their feet ,  |p262going  to meet the charge . A battery to the left kept sending round after round of canister into the advancing column . Each time they were veiled from sight for a little but they kept coming on . He raised his glasses . Brannan was breaking . The Rebels in massed lines were already swarming around his flank . He called frantically to Fullerton , sent him with a message , but it was too late . On the other side Wood 's men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last brigade as it was leaving the line . It slammed back like a door and was shattered . Granger dropped the glasses , groaned . Men were pouring up the slope in masses now , firing as they came . They wore butternut . More men kept coming on behind them . Fullerton was at his side . " General Thomas says prepare to retire . . . . " His voice rose to a shout . " Get out ! While there 's time ! " He leaned over , snook Granger 's arm , still shouting . Granger rode sullenly off through the woods . His bull-like head was low on his chest . He would not increase his pace for all Fullerton 's urging . He thought of the defeat as his own . He did not know that the entire Federal army , except for the few troops on SnodgrassHill , was flying , routed and disorganized , toward Chattanooga.  |p263AT  ten o'clock that night Rives lay down to sleepunder a tree . He slept hard , dreaming of a great pond that stretched from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the black trunks of the trees came up through the ice and at the root of each tree was a delicious , bubbling hole into which a man might thrust his burning tongue . At dawn he awoke . He was so parched that at first he thought he was in the grip of fever , then he knew what he wanted : Water . He had been a fool to try to get through the night without it . He got to his feet , stepped out from the crowd of prone figures . Most of the men were still sleeping but they would all be on their way in a few minutes . Forrest 's cavalry would ride toward Mission Ridge at dawn . He himself had permission to stay here on the field until he had found George Rowan 's body and had seen to its burial . He slipped his hand under his blanket roll . Nobody had got at it in the night . The crackers were still there but he would have to wet his throat before he could eat anything . The devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search of water . His little mare had broken her leg just before sundown . He had got right off and shot her . Dropping with fatigue then , he did n't want his sleep broken by a screaming horse . He walked some distance through the woods before he came on the remount , a sleek bay with US branded on his hips . The leaves were torn off the bushes all around him but he was not eating , just standing there dejectedly , head down . He took a look at the saddle , then chucked his own into the bushes and mounted and struck off through the woods . At the head of a hollow the bay smelled water , began racing . Rives saw the creek : a placid ford , spanned by a foot log , bordered on either side by cane . He flung himself off the horse and crouching on all fours drank greedily . The water was cold , not very clean from the debris that collected around the cane stalks . He waded out to a clearer place , stooped and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fill he threw his hat off onto the bank and splashed water repeatedly over his face and whole head . The horse had moved a little farther downstream and stood in water up to his knees . He had evidently had enough too but he still kept his head low over the water , the nostrils flared out as if at any minute he would suck another drink in . As Rives watched he gave a long sigh , moved slowly to the edge of the stream and still standing in water began to nip the tops off of , the tough cane . Rives went over to the bank and took his crackers out of his blanket roll . He had got them off a dead Yankee late yesterday afternoon . A disappointment  --  that man on ahead had kept yellingthat the bastards had cheese in their haversacks . He wondered if the man had really found cheese in any of those haversacksor whether , wanting some so long , he had just imagined it . There was a dirty reddish-looking border on one or two of the crackers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrificeany more of the cracker than was necessary , and leaning back on his elbow , ate slowly and with relish . There were eight crackers in all . He wished there were more . Still he had had enough to keep him going for several hours . He put his hand in his pocket , felt with pleasure the edge of a silver dollar . When the sun got a little higher he would stop at a house , beg something to eat for himself , maybe buy a little corn for the horse . He glanced disapprovingly at the sleek barrel . Stall-fed , like all the Yankees . He would have to put the corn to him if he expected to get over on the ridge by dark . That kind would go down on you quicker than a grass-fed horse if they were suddenly deprivedof their rations . He whistled to the horse experimentally.  |p265To  his surprise he left the water , came to him . He laughed as he swung up into the handsome saddle . " Old boy , you done jined the cavalry . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the crest Rives paused long enough to take his bearings , then he saw the first ascending black wings and knew that it must be to the right . At ten o'clock he found the place he was seeking . A clearingon the edge of the woods . It had been yellow with sedge grass once but it was motley color now , with everywhere over it strange swellings . Blue , black , gray , brown . . . . Ten thousand moles had worked frenziedly to throw up these hillocks . Steam went up from them and black wings . It was strange there were so many negroes .. . . The smell was driving straight at him . His stomach went tight over the crackers he had eaten . He passed his hand over his face , lifted his eyes with an effort , trying to remember what the man in the ambulance had said : " Field full of sedge grass and a little way down from the Yankee breastworks . " Yes , this was the place . There were the Yankee breastworks still holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sedge but for those moles ... . He got down , tied his horse to a tree and went forward over the field . The first half-dozen were blue , then butternut . More blue . Butternut and blue in a tangle . He bent over methodically , looked for the same fraction of a second into each face . . . . Too many had their tongues out . . . . His thoughts ran on irritably . Wasting time on the blue and yet you had to look . Must n't bend too close . That was how he 'd missed that one back there under the tree . He became obsessed with the idea that the body he had not examined was the one he sought . He went back . The man lay face downwards . Jaunty fit to his coat but he had fattened since . he left his tailor ! The seams were bursting out under each arm . Rives half-bent over , then straightened up quickly . He got a stick , used it for a lever . The black moon of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyes but the lower part was smooth , enormously swollen . He made himself look until he saw the yellow beard growing out of the horrible , tight flesh , then turned and made off crazily through the trees . Over by the fence was a huge mound of fresh turned earth . Living figures moved about it or spilled out over the field . They went in twos . Some carried stretchers . He walked over . A red-headed giant of a man was just clamberingout of the deep trench , naked to the waist and steaming with sweat . He handed his pick to a fellow , growling , " I would n't a cared if he had n't sent me last time . Time before too . Do n't matter how hard the ground is , how many there is of ' em . Every time he sends me . " A man on the other side of the trench laughed . " He seen you put Tom Neely on his back the other night . You got too much muscle for your own good , Ed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew in bright drops . " ' Tai n't fair anyhow . I got a weak stomach , just like anybody else . " He pulled a plug of tobacco out of his pocket , bit off a chew , then saw Rives . " Bill , " he mumbled , " better git your book . " A boy was coming around the side of the trench , a little redbackednotebook in his hand . Rives went to meet him , " LieutenantGeorge Rowan , Aide-de-Camp to General Deshler , " he said , " . . . Tenth Texas Infantry . . .. " The boy stared , flipped the pages of his notebook . " I put ' em all down ' s best I can , " he said hopelessly . " Here , Mister , you want to look ? " Rives took the book , frowned at the greasy figures . Behind him a voice said interestedly , " Tenth Texas . Why do n't you look over there under that tree ? Just brought in a lot of Tenth Texas . " Rives handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree . The bodies lay under it as thick as fruit . They were covered , most of them , with dirty canvas or tow sacks . You could n't look because more kept coming in all the time on stretchers . The man who had spoken had a white handkerchief tied about the lower part of his face . It swayed with his gabbling breaths . Hep267went stooping around , lifting rags of sacks . Rives kept beside him . " No . . . No . . . No. . . . " and then just the indrawn breath that sent you on down the line . George was next to the last , over against the fence . He had to be turned over . Gabbler was pleased , straightened up . " You can most generallyfind ' em if you keep at it . " Rives stood with his head bent . He was thinking : Ben Bigstaff and George Rowan had had the same expression on their faces when they died . Over by the trench somebody was calling : " Hey , Ed , less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looked into the glistening bottom of the trench . He said , " My God . . . . You 'd think . . . . Not enough graves ! " There was silence ; then a spade clinked on a stone . " We can bury him separate if you want , " somebody said mildly . They took George a hundred yards away and buried him near a big sycamore tree . Rives got his knife out , made a cross on the tree in case anybody came looking for the grave . Then he walked back across the field with the soldiers . One had taken the handkerchieffrom his face and swung his spade as he went . " There 's that lady and them niggers come back , " he said suddenly . " Got a wagon this time . " Rives looked up , saw the wagon first and then the woman moving toward it . Tall and in black . She came with an odd , hobbling motion but that was because of the canteens , slung one on each side and one across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a negro stepped out . He had a ragged straw hat , glistening eyeballs . He said , " Mister Rives ! What you doin ' here ? " Rives said , " Antony ! " Then he ran on . The wagon ahead jolted faster . The girl was coming to meet it . Her hands wove in front of her as she came . She cried out shrilly : " Little Ed ! Antony ! You did n't need to stay all day . " She saw him and stopped short , the still moving canteens bobbing back and forth on each side of her . Her eyes fluttered whitely aside for a second , then came back to his face . She cried " Rives , " and was in his arms . The wagon jolted up . A second negro voice cried , " Hi , Mister Rives ! " Her lips met his again , then she drew away . She passed a hand over her face . It left her features composed , severe . She said : " Oh . . . it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside her . The man lying on the ground had a great bloody bandage wound about his head . The hairs of his moustache were brown against green skin . He stared off through the trees . " Gim me drink ! " he said . She had the canteen up and was bending over . The water bubbled at his lips , spilled down over his chin . " Oh , " she cried desperately , " open your mouth . " His lids rose once then fell . " Stay here , " he muttered . " Do n't want move . " She was on her feet , wringing her hands . " I put the bandage on and I think it 's wrong . Maybe no bandage at all . He ca n't talk . " Rives looked away . " Are those our negroes out there with the wagon ? " " Antony , " she whispered , " and little Ed . He always comes with us . " Rives called out in a great voice , " Come here , you boys . Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward , cracked his whip , brought the mules up on the run . The three men lying in the wagon on blood-stained straw stared up sullenly over the side . One was babbling : " He kep ' pulling it off . I 'd a been all right . But he kep ' pulling it off . " " Here , " Rives said , " up with him . Quick . " The brown-moustached man rose on the stretcher , came stolidly to rest on top of the pile . A thin boy kept squirming out from under him . Lucy walked so close to the wagon that her skirt was in danger of being caught by the wheels . Every nowp269and then she reached out and prisoned a clutching hand . Rives grasped a fold of her skirt , held it tight , looked away over the field . " Why does Antony keep walking around out there ? " " Cousin Susan said . . . too far gone , not to fool with them . . . . Just water . I send Ant first ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her brows puckered . " Do you think I ought to let him give morphia pellets too ? " He said , " If you 've got ' em , " and then harshly ; " How long have you been on this field ? " Her eyes clouded with the effort to remember . " We got here in the night . . . . Dr. Reynolds . . . was most kind . . . . But he said dangerous . . . so we stayed down the road . . . . I thought you were dead . . . . " He said , not knowing that he was shouting : " It was George Rowan . I buried him over there . Under that sycamore . See , where the fence turns . " She was not looking . I Icr eyes were fixed on a brown , heaving mass in front of them . She stopped , fell away from the wagon , crossed quivering hands on her breast . " I ca n't stand it , " she cried . " I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . I have tried . . . . " He had not been aware of the horse 's cries until that moment but his pistol was out before she ceased speaking . He walked over , pressed it to the place behind the ear . There was a rumble of gas from the intestines . The horse 's head ceased its angry weaving to and fro , sank with a plop into dead leaves . She was walking on . He went beside her , talking garrulously . " They do n't mind . Anything but breaking their legs . It 's when they ca n't stand up . Scares ' em . When they ca n't stand up . " She put her hand on his arm . " It 's over this way . " They crossed a rustic bridge , the wagon rattling on behind . The house , a cabin , with deep galleries front and back , sat on a rise . The ground in front was wooded but to the side and rear a big meadow sloped away . Rives noticed that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet took the path up the hill as if they had known it a long time . Wounded men lay thick on either side but they were thicker on the gallery . An army of maimed beggars , in butternut mostly . They lay sprawled on pallets or were set rag-doll-like against the wall . Two leaned over the railing to vomit blood almost in unison . A fat woman in a dirty Mother Hubbard was lurching forward between the sprawled figures . She fluttered her hands , cried out shrilly : " You cai n't bring ' em in here . Not room to step now . " Lucy was looking at him . " Take ' em around to the back , " he said . The wagon jolted on , halted where an enormous network of roots sprang out of baked , white ground . Antony was sliding off his seat , whining : " Cai n't git no further'n this , Mister Rives . " He made a threatening gesture , then called out . The negroes were at the side of the wagon . Figures rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to rest against the trunk of the sugar tree . The man with the bandaged head first , then the thin boy . A hairy face with shut eyes . Rives looked above the heads at the black , ridged tree trunk . A big one . It had been tapped for sugar not so long ago . Shining ants ran about in the little cups left from the tapping . She was on her knees , looking up at him while her hands tore swiftly at something white . " Your mother 's in the house . That first room . " He said , still booming : " I will go in and see her . " He mounted the steps . There was , surprisingly , nobody in the hall , but a half-open door on the right revealed rows of cots arranged hospital wise . There was the smell of blood and purulent matter in the room , a gabbling of high voices . Two women were in the runway between the cots . One had on a black riding habit ; her long widow 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eddied from the china cup she held in her hand . Rives stepped up into the room , went down the runway . Bandaged legs . Heads . Closed eyes . One man whose face was aP271welter of dirt and blood put out a hand , maliciously , it seemed , to stay his progress . The man threshing about on the bed , moaning , had an enormous arm , swollen darkly red and blistered , where it was not hidden by scraps of filthy bandage . The odor from it was living evil . It crouched above the bed on angry feet , made forays into the room . Rives thought : Nothing like this on the battle field . He stepped back . His mother was turning around , her nostrils had gone white from being held taut so long . She spoke through clenched teeth . " Rives . . . . " They walked away from the bed . She held his arm , spoke abstractedly yet confidentially : " Poor man . The drug does not seem to have any influence . Your brother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Colonel Lawton thought .... " The other woman kept a kind of step with them . " I 've torn up all the counterpanes. 1 ) o you think those curtains .... " Susan Allard said , " Go in the kitchen . Tell them more hot water . " Out in the hall there was a flurry , a loud , irate voice : " All very well , but you have no authority . " Two women standing in the doorway stepped aside . A figure was revealed . Bald head , red moustache , officer 's insignia . He clicked a hand to his brow , frowning : " Madam , this is most irregular ! " There was silence ; then from one of the cots came a high , almost negro laugh . Rives met the wounded soldier 's gleaming eyes , then looked back at his mother . She was moving to meet the surgeon . You could not see her feet for that long skirt , but she would be on tiptoe ; her chin was tilted . She said : " Dreadful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing the best we can . " The surgeon 's lips jerked under his red moustache . He glared around the room . " Captain Mainwaring . . . reports . . . My God , how many have you got in here ? " She said quietly , " I believe we were the first people on the field . This woman let me bring them here . . . I think her name is Parkins . . . . " His reddish eyebrows arched up . His mouth opened , then closed . He made irritable gestures of dismissal , was turning to leave the room . But she had him by the arm , was propelling him toward a cot . " This one , Doctor . . I 've been giving him morphia every three hours . I think maybe too much . . . " He said : " Oh , morphia . " He held back , then sank on glisteningheels . His sharp nose dived forward , came up , hung , like a dog 's on a point . He tapped the distended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that crackling sound ? Emphysema . Got a bullet in his right lung . Doubt if you could operate . . . . " Antony was in the room , turning his ragged hat around in his hands . " Ole Miss , they 's a whole lot of ' em over in the hollow . Some of ' em 's ' live . " Rives went through the door . The hall was dark and cool . He passed down it , pursued by a voice , Antony 's voice but heard long ago . . . . " Whole lot of ' em , Ole Miss . . . yonder in the hollow . . . . " No , that was black berries ... . He came out onto the back gallery , went down the steps . There were more of them under the tree . A small , worried-lookingwoman went bending about among them with a basin . The man with the bloody bandage had been laid out flat on his back between two arching tree roots . Lucy was crouched on her knees beside him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , laid a hand on her shoulder . She got to her feet in a flurry of skirts , handed him the fan . " If you 'll just hold that . . . I 've got to get my hair back tighter . " Her hands went up to the heavy coil of hair at the back of her neck . She was lookingstraight at him , her mouth a little open . There were little beads of perspiration on her upper lip . His hand slipped from the soft flesh of her shoulder , closed on her wrist . He motioned toward the meadow . " Come on , let 's go over there . " She looked at him a second , then she bent and laid the fan on the ground . They went off , stepping carefully among the rows of wounded , toward the dark , cedared ravine . P273The summer morning wore on its way . During the next hour more wounded were brought in . The supply of pallets had given out , and the wounded or dying men were laid on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , against the trunks of trees . There was about the place a great murmuring . Flies had gathered in swarms and fed on the clots of blood that spattered the ground or on the faces and hands of the wounded . The man whom Lucy had been tending asked to have his position changed and lay with his eyes fixed on the distant woods . He was fearfully turbaned , like an Eastern potentate . He did not seem to mind the flies that swarmed in the great cap-like mass on his forehead , but when they strayed down onto his cheek , he grimaced and sometimes called out . A negro woman moving among the wounded pitied him and breaking a leafy bough from a tree placed it in his hand . The nerveless fingers fell away but she tied the stalk to his wrist . He was able then by moving his wrist slightly to brush the flies away . A man sitting by unable to move because his leg had been broken called out his pleasure at the arrangement : " Now you can keep ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moving his bough with its drooping leaves faster as if to please his friend . All through the morning it swayed back and forth . The September sky was cloudless now and blue . The man with the broken leg glanced wearily at the sun from time to time and calculated the hour . In the middle of the morning he glanced down and saw the green leaves of the bough fallen athwart his friend 's face . He bent near enough to ascertain that the leaves did not stir , then looked up at the sun . He calculated that it must be eleven o'clock 1  --    0N the morning after the battle a band of Confederatecavalry came up out of the Chickamauga valley and followed the road which winds along the crest of Mission Ridge . There were five hundred men from Dibrell 's brigade and a strong advance guard of Armstrong 's men . GeneralForrest himself rode at the head of the column with General Armstrong . The cavalcade moved slowly . The two generals kept their horses at a walk while they noted the battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road . Arms , saddles , blankets , caissons , wagons and their teams , an ambulance with its broken tongue half driven into the trunk of a tree . Forrest 's eyes were bright . " My God , Armstrong , they 've left enough stuff to equip a brigade . " Armstrong was looking ahead . " There 's something up the road , General . " Forrest withdrew his gaze from the woods . " Rear guard , I reckon . Well , let 's give ' cm a dare . " Armstrong turned , shouted an order . It was echoed by the men behind and the column swept forward at full speed . The Union troopers stayed long enough to deliver one volley , then fled in the direction of Chattanooga . The Confederates pursued to a bend in the road , then came to a halt . Here there were even more evidences of yesterday 's conflict . Abandoned arms and equipment were thick even in the road and moving on ahead in the dust were still a few stragglers . Some stood and waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had to be rounded up by the cavalrymen . Forrest had half a dozen brought over to the side of the road for questioning . Two were Germans who shrugged their shoulders and grunted gutturally . The third , a sharp-faced boy of eighteen or nineteen , suddenly broke off his ready answers , grinning : " Why n't you look for yourself ? " Forrest and Armstrong looked in the direction of his pointing finger and saw a hundred yards ahead a man swinging from the limb of a tree : a Federal officer , smartly uniformed , with field glasses slung across his breast . He dropped to the ground as they came up , stood grimly while he was relieved of his glasses and pistols . The group of soldiers who led him to the rear suddenly let out a shout of laughter and Anderson smiled . " What you laughing at ? " Armstrong said . Anderson , still grinning , glanced at the other general . " He said he recognized 01 ( 1 Bedford from his picture and he hoped to God he 'd break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the captured equipment had kept Forrest in high good humor all morning . He laughed now , glanced at Anderson'sfigure and shook his head . " You 'd never make it , Charley . I better try . " He was off his horse in a moment . Standing on tiptoe he caught hold of a low hanging limb , swung himself up , then climbed nimbly from one bough to another until he reached the wooden observation platform built into the tree 's fork . Armstrong down below turned up an anxious face : " All right ? " " All right , " Forrest said , and raised the Yankee officer 's glasses to his eyes . The scene that lay before him was one of great natural beauty and grandeur . On either side rose majestic mountains . The haze that drifted in front of them made their wooded slopes appear blue even in the morning sunshine , and moving clouds cast a chequered pattern of light and shade over the valley at their feet . The valley was wide and green , cleft by the smoothly **25;5022;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces and began shrieking at the Fearings , who had inflamed popular sentimentagainst her . So the trial wore on . One day as Fenton passed Bathsheba 's cell , he met a man of about his own age , entering  --  Bible in hand . Young Mr. Fearing had come to pray with the woman . Civilly , Fenton stood aside and laid off his beaver hat . The other did not see him . His radiant face , his black silk robe , his delicate bands and slender hands made even the unregenerate Fenton feel respect . So they encountered each other without a word , these two young men , who had at least one thing in common . Both were products not of the old England but the new . Fenton grimaced slightly . He was not used to being ignored . NOT once had Mr. Parre come to Boston during the trial . Only when word came from Cousin Macey that a much severer sentence than he had ever thought possible had been pronounced , did he call angrily to those about him at Paradise that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ! It was almost as if he thought he could perform a miracle . He was confused and surprised to see how great a change two months had wrought in his cousin . She was grim and silent , and looked ten years older . " You are late , Cousin Jude . ' T is all over but the branding . " " I tell you there shall be no branding . " " Yet the statute books would have permitted death . " " Oh , ay . I know such laws are put in to frighten folk , never with the idea of enforcing them . The Governor will changep201the sentence . What ! My boy with an A branded upon his forehead ? Never ! You are utterly mad ! " " ' T is you who are mad , Cousin Jude . From the first , the Court was dead set against the two . . . and I tell you it was those reptiles , those Fearings , who egged them on . And once I was so sunken and blind as to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' T is not only adultery the Court is punishing . ' T is you as well . Your high-handedness . Sitting out there in Canaan as though you owned the town , and then every so often roaring into Boston about this and that , telling the Governor and his Council what to do . If you had only a humbleand contrite heart ! " " Who wants a humble and contrite heart ? And have n't I usually got what I roared for ? " " You did . . . from Endicott and Winthrop , but they are dead . ' T is quite another man sits in the Governor 's mansion today . This Bellingham . The other men , they did much as pleased themselves . But not this Bellingham . He will always please the people . And the people , inflamed by the Fearings , want an utter degradation of these two . " " But gentlemen of family and position ! Are they to be branded for every little stepping aside ? Branded , like runaway slaves ? " " So it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept this punishment . . . . " " Of course , I know what those judges are after . They fear Christopher may become a heretic preacher . They will crush the cockatrice in the egg . For not Christ himself , nor Paul , could stand up and preach with a red A upon the forehead . What ninnies my two lads have proved themselves ! Fenton , to marry such a crazed dame , and Christopher . . . ! "  | " Oh , Jude , you do not half realize the richness and goodnessof these two young men . " " I do not ! I 've come to think they must be bastards , no true sons of mine . They have been wicked and perverse , beyondall reason . I can stand Fenton 's doing evil , for he is bad . But Christopher ! The good man who does wrong always works more havoc than the bad , for he 's had no practice . I 've seen it again and again . But the one boy smells as foul to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Governor Bellingham with such black hate in your heart . " " Oh , God knows I do not hate them ! I mean , ' t is because I have always loved them , I hate them so . Nay now , Cousin Macey , of your pity , read what is in my heart and forget my words . " He bowed his greying head . She placed a hand upon his stiff old shoulders . " I understand this hate ' of yours , Cousin Jude . . . . Oh , Jude . . . Jude ! " THE meeting between the Governor and Mr. Parre was brief enough . They had known each other for years , and Mr. Parre had always accounted him but a little man . Yet now he went to him with a fear he had never felt for the great Endicott and the greater Winthrop . He was ill at ease . He felt his words lacked weight and , worst of all , for the first time he felt himself to be an old man . His words sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lost his old fiery impressiveness , and he knew it . Bellingham listened to him silently  --  hiseyebrows raised . Because he made no answer , Mr. Parre talked on and on , often repeating himself in his plea for his son . In the midst of this tirade , he suddenly remem/bered his grandfather , dead for fifty years . Sir Anselm Parre would tell the same story over and over again . It seemed to him in his own words he caught the very accents of that ancientknight . He stopped abruptly . To his own and the Governor'samazement , he found that he was offering to resign his judgeship over Canaan . He had judged Canaan for twentysevenyears . Bellingham looked at him coldly from his narrow eyes . He felt about in a wallet that lay on the table before him , filled with papers . One he drew forth . It was a petition to his Excellency , the Governor . He handed it to Mr. Parre . In amazement , the tortured man read . Canaan wished another judge . And signed to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , old neighbours . Parson Redbank 's name was not there , nor the Miller Blue 's . Orde had signed and Colonel Coffin , Dillingham and Hurlingheart , Preserved English , the smith , John Truly , the Elder  --  once his own servant . William Williams . . . why , the first winter in Canaan , the man had been sick and would have died if Jude had not taken him into his own house . Paul Ovington , Will Partridge , James Tucker . And of course the two Baileys , Seth and Noah . He went over the list again . " My own people have cast me out , " he thought . The Governor was looking at him coldly . A mean and hateful eye he had . And those delicate eyebrows ! And what carefully tended moustachios and stiletto beard ! He said courteously , " I shall not make this petition known , Mr. Parre . But I must suggest , to your private ear , that perhaps your usefulness . in Canaan is over . You have , in your way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have heard again and again Winthrop and Endicott say . . . " " Oh , damn Winthrop and Endicott . . . they are both dead , are n't they ? Let them lie in their coffins and rot . . . . " ( Whatp204on earth am I saying ? ) But at least his voice had lost the old man 's futility that it had earlier to his ear , when he had pled for Christopher . " The fact , Mr. Governor , is . . . that have no idea of giving up my office . . . I tell you . . . f at next election I am defeated , that is another matter . " But he was already utterly defeated . That day , before he eft the Governor 's chamber , he had set his hand to the paper which made him no more judge over Canaan . And he saw that Cousin Macey 's words were , in part , right . It was not only his stubborn boy that was to be punished , but himself as well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouths the words must have gone through ) certain careless remarks Mr. Parre had recently made about the comparative harmlessness of Christopher 's and Bathsheba 's sin . And the Governor had refused in any way to mitigate the sentence against the culprits . After all , Bellingham was right . Should the man who could not keep order over his own household rule over others ? But not Judge Jeffries nor Samuel nor Moses could have kept order in my household , he thought , as he plunged through the crowd of housewives and country-folk gathered to barter in the publicmarket . Yet the thought came back to him . . . . If in his youth , during riotous student days , he had better controlled himself , he would have been able to pass on a sterner mettle to his boys . My fault . Not the lads ' fault , mine . Weak and old and utterly alone he was , with a loneliness of spirit youth can not even guess . Nothing but failure could he see behind him , and death before . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but " Elizabeth . " His mind turned back to her with an aching homesickness  --  not to Fidelia , his pretty servant-girl . . . . But that night , still in the mood to drink deep of his dis/grace , he wrote to Jazan and Hagar and bade them , taking Gervase Blue with them , be in Boston by the following Thursdayand there witness the punishment of their brother and brother 's wife . IT was close to three o'clock on a hot August night , and ForethoughtFearing still paced his study , although his father had long before gone to his sweating bed . Forethought knew that night air , no matter how refreshing , is dangerous , but all his casements were open . To keep his papers from blowing , he had stopped twice and put heavy tomes on top of them . Sometimes he picked up his Bible , but quickly put it down again . This night he had set aside to communewith God , for on the morrow  --  no , later only this very day  --  he would address the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branding of Christopher and Bathsheba Parre . Yet God would not come . In vain , upon his knees he had prayed . But , hollow , the words had mocked him with their falseness , seeming to refuse to lift themselves higher than his ceiling . Something was wrong . He picked up the carefully prepared lecture that he intended , later that day , to recite . Surely the words were right . That quotation from Deuteronomy , about the stoning of the adulteress . Those fiery lines about an even more fiery Hell . His father had helped with their indicting . From the beginning , Peter Fearing had turned this affair largely over to his son . It was the younger man who had carriedconsolation and Hell-fire to the culprits in their cells . It was he who had , on three successive Sabbaths , preached to the congregation of the horrors in this world and the next that waited for such folk as this ( and they , the man and the woman , chained to their guards , had been dragged from their cells to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lips like a holy river . How he had loathed and despised the sinners ! His voice , which at times was too gently pitched , had rung out like a trumpet . A woman had miscarried , an old man had been stricken , at hearing those awful words . And his father had been pleased . All that had been simple , speaking among friends within his own church . But the lecture upon the Common would be ( as his father pointed out ) a different matter . For among this disordered group would be many of those who had bitterlyopposed the Fearing influence . Men who did not believe a man 's power to vote should depend on his church membership . Rough folk from the wharves , restless spirits , who  --  like Mr. Parre  --  thought the affairs of church and state were too closely intermixed for the best advance of either . And they would not be sitting tidily in pews , the men on their side and the women on theirs  --  each person where he belonged according to his degree and sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cruelty they would see . With his stomach he loathed and despised all those who would gather , and himself as well . Something must be wrong . And God had given him no sign of his approval . It was not Forethought 's habit to write out the exact words that he would say , but on this occasion , influenced by his father , he had done so and committed the matter to memory . Necessarily it was short , as Forethought Fearing 's voice was not strong enough to be maintained for long at such great pitch . Already had Harvard College printed the three sermons ( taken down by an admirer in shorthand ) and this coming lecture . Peter Fearing had seen to it that the pamphlet wouldp207be ready for sale , as soon as the branding was done and before the mob could disperse . The old clergyman had made a small fortune by similar works of his own . He was bound his boy should do as well as himself . It would be Forethought 's first printed words . Still he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but stealing through the veins , poisoning the soul . " Oh , Heavenly Father , who from my infancy set me aside to be thy holy instrument , grant me some sign that I do as thou wouldst . " And he listened . And he heard the first lazy chirping of the birds . " Oh , Lord God , who holds the sparrow 's flight in thy hand , hold me up and strengthen me . " A crisp daybreak wind fluttered the curtains at the casementand whirled like fingers of a thief across his table . It touched his feverish forehead . He lifted his head to receive its comfort . It was gone , and he looked at his table . His mouth fell open . He could remember how carefully , an hour ago , he had set Wigglesworth 's God 's Controversy with New England upon the sheets of his lecture . It could not be so little a wind had lifted that heavy volume . Yet , flung in scornful disorder about his study floor , were the eight pages he and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filch them away from under the heavy book , cast them in impious confusion ? He stared and stared at them . THE cocks began to crow , and the twilight was drawn from the sea like a cloth from the face of a corpse . The sun rodep208up , hotter and hotter , burning away the wisps of fog . So it was day . A drummer , a trumpeter , and a crier , gorgeously dressed in heavy woollen uniforms , went through the streets and alleys , telling all that this was the day upon which certain adulterous folk were to be served due punishment in the name of God and the Bay Colony . All were bidden to the Common to watch the carrying out of justice . The two young girls , who lay that night at Widow Macey 's , heard them . Hot and fitful , they had lain awake for most of the night . The woman herself had sat the night out in her hall below . She did not dare leave her Cousin Jude alone , and he would not go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was forcinghis three daughters to witness the disgrace to both their brothers . It was not the first time Jude had done a thing inexplicableto her . And she told him that she had sold her shop to Merchant Fayrweather . This gave her all the money she would need to start out her new life in Rhode Island , for with Boston she was through . Her house would stand empty for a while , and old Black Dido she would leave behind to care for it . As the clamour sounded without and they knew the time would come within an hour , Evelyn Macey tried once more to turn her cousin 's mind from his determination that Jazan and Hagar should witness the cruel sight . She swore that she herself would not go . And let the maids stay with her . Jazan at least . She was already sick and stricken . The man said violently , " Let there be no more whoring in my family . Let these young misses learn that the wages of sin are death and of adultery the iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Jazan is more in need of such ap209lesson , I doubt not , than Hagar . Hagar can stay behind with you , if you wish . " Little Hagar had run down the stairs into the hall . Now she stood looking from father to cousin . Her fair curling hair , her delicate colouring , and the long , loose night-rail made her look an angel . " To see this pain inflicted will , I pray , sanctify me and cleanse me . And may God cleanse that unfortunate and sinfulwoman , and my wicked , misguided brother  --  Amen . " " Cousin Jude , leave that child at home ! " But Hagar explained that she had heard from Dido that young Mr. Fearing was lecturing that morning , " And I will not be denied Mr. Fearing . " Slowly and in holiday mood , in spite of the intolerable heat , men and women began to bear towards the Common . From docks and fish piers , houses , shops , taverns , rope-walks , and breweries , the feet of an idle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started out at first in well-ordered cavalcade . Jude Parre , sick and weary , leaned upon his cousin 's arm  --  for in the end she could not bear to let him go without her . He kept his chin up and stared about him with the mournfulpride of captive hawk . Next , Gervase Blue , tight-lipped and scornful , in the leathern leggings and coarse smock of a farm servant ( instead of the Sabbath clothing that would have been more appropriate for the great occasion ) , stalked frowning , in front of Jazan and Hagar , making room for them through the crowd . Last of all came Dido . She was grimacing and grinning . With her was the bonded boy that did the work once Gervase had done . A starry-eyed and frightened child , who was at least wise enough to be always " open and frank " with his mistress , even if he did thieve a little.  |p210Jazan  saw many whom she had known in happier days . She turned away her disturbing eyes , and although already sufferingfrom heat drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nausea went over her and she trembled . There came the twitching Tailor Holmes . And behind him , his three ugly daughters clustered about Will Sisley . Will had grown very plump and pink with new found prosperity . One of the three Holmes girls he had married ; and already the business was known as Holmes and Sisley . It was not for naught men marry such girls . No one could remember which one was his wife . They all seemed to claim him and on such public occasions clumped about him as though he were their common husband . Soon they had reached the beginning of the Common and , in the milling about , Gervase and his two young ladies becameseparated from the others . Jazan saw Captain Oakes , ruddy and dark , looking about him with his small roguish eyes . He was sweating as only dark and ruddy men can sweat . She saw a flash in his eyes and a smile forming in the midst of his beard . She half believed he recognized her . She looked away . In bitterness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to do as they pleased , work little havoc , and get no punishment . It is the good men who , when they stumble , always cause the most pain and pay the heaviest penalty . Her father had been right about this . She felt a tired and wistful love for Christopher . He had always been gentle and dear to her . She remembered back to the time she was four or five only , and a horn-book had first been hanged about her neck . It was flat like a paddle , and on it was printed the alphabet for her to learn . She had hated the horn-book and had cried . Kit had taken her to the garden and showed her how to play battledore and shuttlecock with her horn-book . So she had comep211to love it and had learned A , B , and C that first morning . Whenever she had learned three more letters , he would reward her by a game of battledore and shuttlecock . The town herdsmen had driven the animals that usually pastured upon the Common as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corslets and helmets held the crowd in order . A gallows was set up , for upon this grisly eminence the culprits would meet their punishment . Her father . . . would he ever recover his old strength and pride in himself , after this heavy blow to his family name ? Would any Parre ever again hold up his head ? And Jazan loved her suffering family . " Jazan . " It was Jonathan who called to her . He kissed her and Hagar with damp smacks and shook hands with Gervase . He looked cheerful and proved somewhat talkative , as though determined that it was best to pretend that it was all quite pleasant . He had some very good seats for them . He spoke as though it were the launching of a ship or the mustering of soldiers . But the fat hand that mopped away the sweat from his upper lip was shaking . His smile was fixed and forced . Jazan had shocked him with her stricken look . Even her lips were white . Not only was her usual prettiness gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth , blank eyes , and that depressing black hood flapping about her face . He hummed cheerfully , although a little nervously . The fair Agnes was enthroned upon a country cart . At her feet lay five dead hens . The horse had been led away . Jonathan helped the younger sisters up over the big wheel . " Well , my dear , it is hotter even than yesterday . Every ship in the harbour is becalmed . " Agnes was still beautiful , although her body was somewhat swollen by approaching maternity . She had a look of inhuman content . In marriage she had found her chance to enlarge the scope of her life . Now was she withdrawn into her own security . And her husband she had drawn in with her , and her daughter Fidelia . Both were as closely held within her as was the unborn child . All were a part of her . And why should not she , who had always loved herself so much , love these others who were as much hers as her own smooth white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown herself brutal and domineering , but he never had . It was part of Jonathan 's strength that he never resisted the inevitable . Gervase stood leaning against the dirty wheel . His arm was thrown over the side of the cart , so that Jazan could press her knee against it . This much comfort , and only this much , could he offer her . But Agnes , as if resenting the smallest intimacybetween her sister and the servant , soon sent him on a fruitless errand . Would he be so good as to look about and see where Mr. Parre and the Widow Macey might be ? " There 's small chance to find them , Agnes , but I 'll look about me . " So he was gone . Agnes shrugged and said to Jonathan , but for Jazan to hear , " I wish you would tell him that I am no Agnes ' to him . I am Madam , or I am Mrs. Fayrweatherandwhen I speak to him he is to pull off his hat . " " He had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now he was gone , she was sure she would be sick . " Then he might touch his forelock . In Boston even the crudest servants know this much of civility . " Jazan gritted her teeth to control temper and nausea . Now men on horseback , with halberds and armour over their buff coats , filed out on to the Common between the ranks of the foot-soldiers . And there was the wild , sweet music of the trumpets and the rattle of the drums . Jazan could not see the prisoners , but she knew they were in the midst of thisp213conclave , stopping now at the gallows ' foot . Not far from it , a canopy had been set up , and under this stewed Governor Bellingham , his Council , the Lieutenant-Governor , and certain leading citizens . There was a bright fanfare from the trumpets , and a cry for silence . An officer of the Court , standing at the gallows ' foot , chanted out the rhythmic legal phrases which told the reason these people were to be punished . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's canopy and slowly mounted to the scaffold . They had proved themselves her brother 's enemies , these Fearings . Jazan 's heart pounded with resentment . There was not a cloud in the sky , not a breath of wind . The flags of the Colony , scarlet with a white square in the corner ( but no cross ) , hung to their staffs . The great , glaring metal bowl of the sky pressed down , closer and closer , on the sweltering city . Even standing still , all were drenched with sweat . No matter how delicate the lady , she had a dewy upper lip and her curls clung to her forehead . No matter how unworldlythe clergyman , he stuck to his clothes . Forethought Fearing under his glowing black silk  --  even he could feel a rivulet springing from between his shoulder blades , trickling down his spine . Those closest to him saw that his lips moved in prayer . His father , roasting under the canopy , noticed that he had no notes with him  --  only his Bible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lecture was committed to memory , he should have taken notes along . It is easy to forget even holy words on so hot a day . Upon the scaffold , a black figure against the wavering heat , Forethought Fearing stood , and in too low a voice began to read to the crowd . Not a word could Jazan hear , but she was shocked at a frank bawling , " Louder , and it please you , sir . " She had never heard a clergyman yelled at like this before.  |p214He  paused and , after a moment , proceeded in somewhat forced but carrying tones . He had his Bible open in his hands , readingfrom the eighth chapter of the Gospel according to John . It was the story of the woman taken in adultery . " Now Moses in the law commanded us , that such should be stoned : but what sayest thou ? This they said , tempting him , that they might have to accuse him . But Jesus stooped down , and with his finger wrote on the ground , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking him , he lifted up himself , and said unto them , He that is without sin among you , let him first cast a stone at her . And again he stooped down , and wrote on the ground . And they which heard it , being convicted by their own conscience , went out one by one , beginning at the eldest , even unto the last : and Jesus was left alone , and the woman standing in the midst . When Jesus had lifted up himself , and saw none but the woman , he said unto her , Woman , where are those thine accusers ? hath no man condemned thee ? She said , No man , Lord . And Jesus said unto her , Neither do I condemn thee : go , and sin no more . " He shut the book and paused . The hot sun glittered on his silvery head . There was a hush , ominous as the silence before a storm . And old Peter Fearing , where he sat amongst his fellows close by the Governor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt his heart jump , contract , stop  --  and in anguish take up its work again . This was not the text he and his dear boy had selected and so laboriously prepared a proper lecture upon . And what next ? Like the crazed Gadarene swine , he saw his son plunge over a cliff . Actually , was he asking , as his next words seemed to suggest , who amongst them was withoutsin ? Looking straight , as he spoke , to the high seats about the Governor ? Pointing out , at such a time , that Christ hadp215taught that to look upon a woman with adultery in the heart was the same as having sinned ? Asking for pity for the culprits ? Oh , great Jehovah , save him now ! His heart again throbbed , stopped , filled his body with agony , then tittered like a dancer 's feet and went on . Through these waves of pain and vertigo , he heard a voice which he knew to be his son 's  --  but flat and far away , without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He hesitated , as though he were trying to remember words committed to memory , but his father knew these were not the words he had so studied upon . Weak and foolish words , they seemed . There was a murmur from the crowd . A slight but unmistakable hiss . Forethought turned his modelled head , his face lifted . " Whom do you hiss ? " he cried with ringing passion . " Is it Christ or me ? " " Say , Parson , " bawled an intoxicated sailor . " We came here to see them get the branding-iron , not all this conversion . " " You criticize me , " cried Forethought , " because I show you but only a little of the heavenly kindness your Master showed while he was on this earth . Do you think , if he were here today , there would be any branding of these wretched folk ? " " Go on with the branding , and . . . " " I hai n't never sinned . I 'll cast the first stone if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to if young people hear lectureslike this ? " " Give us the woman first . " Governor Bellingham was on his feet , looking about , with anger on his handsome , supercilious face . Mr. Peter Fearing was drawn together into an S. His corpulent old body found a new suppleness under the agony he endured . Hardly could he hear the commotion that followed his son 's words . Blind- ing , deafening waves of darkness rolled over him . Was this death ? Was he dying ? But the fat old heart picked up its work once more . Jazan had thrown back her hood . Her face shone with wonder and tenderness . The way he had lifted his head and said , " Whom do you hiss ? Is it Christ or me ? " And the lovely words our Saviour had said so long ago , " Neither do I condemnthee : go , and sin no more . " It had been unexpected , marvellous  --  and yet even she knew that the words which followed the reading of the Gospel had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say diffused her with joy . Hagar was chattering with indignation . It was the sun , she said , that had for the moment addled the good man 's brains . Jonathan 's eyes narrowed behind fat lids . He looked what he was , a keen merchant , listening to a description of a new line of goods . Can you really sell things like that ? Christ 's own teachings they may be , but are they profitable ? Agnes calmly pushed the five dead hens from her with her foot . They had an unlovely , dead-hen smell . She had not noticed it when first she had mounted into the cart . Perhaps the heat . . . Bathsheba , clad in black , was upon the scaffold . Her orange hair glowing in the sun . Having seen her in many weak and paltry moods , Jazan was unprepared for the heroic stand she now took . Her step did not falter . She knelt , as the executionerbade her kneel . One man pulled her head back upon a block , holding her by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charcoal brazier . The woman 's face was turned up towards the metallic sky . Jazan put her hands over her ears . Why had Gervase desertedher when she needed him most ? If only she might feel the touch of his arm against her knee . She waited with shut eyes to hear some hideous scream , more terrible than ever shep217had heard before . There was a little murmur of cruel satisfactionfrom the crowd , a slight " ah "  --  such as a glutton might emit , wiping the grease of a fat duck from his beard . Jazan opened her eyes . At the foot of the scaffold Fenton waited , holding out his hand to Eathsheba , publicly taking her back . The crowd whistled and catcalled . But the man and woman seemed alike in their cool indifference to the crowd . They were gone . Jazan had not seen Christopher since he had left Paradise three months ago . Now she covered her face with her hands . She heard Jonathan murmur in pity , " What that poor fellow must have suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scaffold . Jazan was filled with desperation . The smell of the dead hens , the mob of people , the pouring molten heat of the sun , the terror of the branding-iron . She must escape . She flung herself over the wheel , unnoticed by her companions . SHE could not have made her way through the crowd to her cousin 's house on High Street if she had wished . Nor was it a roof and city streets that she craved ; but trees , grass , solitude , and sky . She headed toward Blackstone 's Point , the nearest spot of wild land at hand . The crowd was left behind . Although there were houses , gardens , and domestic creatures , there were no people , for every man , woman , and child had gone to the Common . Chickens picked about doorways . Goats bleated . Cats and dogs lay in shady nooks , flat and prostrated by the heat . Swine roused up to grunt at her . But there was not one person . She came to a spring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and plunged her hands and arms into the icy water and splashed it over her face and throat . Kit 's face ! Kit 's face  --  quick , and often laughing  --  branded for life ! And Mr. Fearing had said if Christ himself were here this day , there would have been no branding . Who were the people of Boston to set themselves up against Christ himself ? At last she moved on , and over the bars , into Blackstone 's orchard , the very spot where , two years before , she had last spoken to Forethought Fearing . In time the orchard ended and she was in rough blueberry pasture , and they and the bayberries and the sweet fern were waist high . Fragrant they smelled , under that searing sun . Then there was no more fertile land but sand dunes only and grass rough as an animal 's pelt . She left behind her the shade of trees , the refreshing chill of the spring . Driven by sorrow and despair , she ploughed through the intense heat which trembled over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point , and in every direction except behind her was salt water , and the tide was high . Charlestown and Cambridge could she see from this elevation . The flat , oily water hardly had the courage to make waves . She saw ships becalmed in the Back Bay , and oarsmen painfully rowing their barges of fire-wood and hay across the enchanted water . Like water-spiders , these boats seemed to walk along on their oars . The desolation and lonelinessof the spot , the inhuman quality of the intense heat , dimmed for her the terror of the day . And she understood how Christ had loved mankind and knew what it was Forethought Fearing had wished to say . She lay upon her back in the course , scant pelt which coveredthe sand . A deformed pine-tree partly shaded her . The white gulls wheeled . She heard their crying . The whistle of thep219sandpiper and the laughter of the kittiwake . This far out to sea upon the narrow point there was a breath of air , small but cool . She did not know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her father , of Forethought Fearing , and of Christ . It was magnificent , what young Mr. Fearing had tried to say . But what had he really said ? She could not remember . And why was the crowd so angry ? A sound of turned pebbles on the beach below her , close to the water that wearily slapped the coast . She turned over on her belly , propped up her chin on her hands , and looked down . A solitary man , muffled in black , was within three or four yards of her . She thought if she held her breath he would not see her . He seemed utterly lost within himself . But Forethought Fearing raised his eyes and looked into hers . Their heads were almost on a level . She saw the stricken soul of the man pouringout of those eyes . " So it is you , Jazan Parre . And in the flesh this time . " " Yes , Mr. Fearing . " " We have both sought a solitary spot to mourn . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . " " Is he , or is he not ? I do not know . But , for a few hours , I knew that he was . And she was my sister , even that wretched woman . " He clenched his right hand and flung it away from him . " My poor father . . . I had to get a chair and bearers to take him home . I almost killed him . And the doctor . . . he told me to stay away until nightfall . And my place is with my father , my whole heart is with him , and now . . . " Jazan put out her hand , sympathy and pity rising in her . " Come , " she said . " Come sit beside me under this pine-tree . There is a little breeze off the Bay . " She smiled soberly and said , " We must not mourn alone . " Laboriously , he climbed the sand dune . She had neverp220noticed before that out of doors ( except upon the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , elegant body in the world of grass and meadow seemed a little disjointed . He took his black hat off and flung it beside him . She saw the metallic curls , cropped so close to the thin skull . " A head like the head upon a heathen coin , " her father had said of him . About his neck , limp and dishevelled , were the sad remains of the fastidiousbands with which he had started the day . As unconsciously as though he were alone , he took off these bands , opened his shirt so that some air might come in upon his chest . She was surprised at the almost feminine beauty of the neck and throat . No man in Canaan was so unburned by weather , so exotic in delicate whiteness . He seemed unaware of her , and did not glance at her . His lips were set tightly over the uneven teeth as though he would never speak , but in time he began . " I had indeed prepared a proper lecture for this day . My father had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week ago . " " Sir , why was it that you had full charge of this matter of my brother  --  and not your father ? " She had resented this bitterly . " He said  --  he has always said  --  before I can become a proper clergyman , not merely a pulpit preacher , I must learn to handle human beings . He wanted me to try . . . he thought I had done well  --  only until today . . . . He told me everything to say , when I visited them in their cells , when I preached on three different Sabbaths . . . . And it was really he , not I , whose words I had got by heart to deliver today . But last night I was determined not to lie unconscious as any swine . I paced my study ; I begged God to assure me that I was on the right course  --  for I was having doubts . I did not know from whence they came . I begged a sign from God . "  |p221He  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips . " Was it some demon of jealousy that tempted me with dissatisfaction ? You see , the words I had prepared were not really my own . I did not wish to use those wise and cautious words . I could do better myself , alone . And then such a little thing , a small wind only , and I thought I had received a sign . Our Lord no more than myself was satisfied  --  and I , well . . strangely , I fell asleep . " Jazan had no word to throw into the chasm of silence that grew between them . The man 's nervous hands tore at the coarse grass . His eyes were fixed to sea . He continued rapidly . " I dreamed that you came quickly walking towards me . But you were a mere child , far younger than even you were when first I knew you . We met in a sandy land , a golden land , but it was not like the sands here about Boston . I knew we were treading the land our Saviour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sad and simple man , in no ways well favoured , but filled with ineffable forgiveness . And he sat upon the ground , and a crowd stood round about . He wrote with his finger upon the ground . I knew that if I could but see the words he wrote . . . . " Again he pressed his fingers to lips , which rustled slightly , so dry they were . " There was a woman  --  a woman . . . flushed , confused , ashamed . Your brother 's wife . Her red hair coiled about her nakedness . Half clad she was . . . just pulled from her lover 's bed . I could see that those who stood about had asked our Lord a question , waited upon his answer . But he wrote upon the ground . At last he said , He who is withoutsin among you , let him cast the first stone , ' and Go , ' he said , and sin no more . ' I woke up , and a great passion was on me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so contrary were they to Christ 's own love . Our Lord 's voice . . . the very intonation , the sad dropping of the syllables . . . oh , they rang in my ears ! Now , now , was it to hand ! The words my Saviour said . . . and more important . . . those words he wrote upon the sand . As God lives , I saw those words . Then I knew what he , himself , would have said if he had been with us today in Boston . The right words came pouring into my brain . I made no notes . I trusted , when the time came , he would stand beside me . ' T is often thus with me . . . I preach best when I know least clear what it is I will say . But the time came . . . . Oh , Jazan , you saw how lamentably I failed ! I could not speak . Even while I was reading out the Gospel , I was seized with fear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tempt my inordinate pride . Think you , if God had sent the dream , he would have abandoned me when my time of trial was upon me ? " And at last he turned his grievous face upon her . " And there was something wrong in my dream  --  one little thing  --  do you see what it was ? " " No , no . There was nothing wrong . It was a wonderful and holy dream . " " Why , " he laughed excitedly , the pedant rising in him , " it was not by the Sea of Galilee Christ spoke those awful words . ' T was in the Temple of Jerusalem . I had never thought of that until I began to read the Scripture . Then I instantly feared I was wrong . Would God , even in a dream , have misquoted Holy Writ ? " Jazan was huddled together , her arms about her knees . Her face , flushed from excitement , was averted . Suddenly she flung out her arms , shook her fallen hair from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the first time since he had sat besideher that their eyes had met fully . " The Lord wished to show you , sir , that his humanity and forgiveness was not limited to the Temple of Jerusalem  --  itp223would have been the same in Galilee , or here , today , in Boston . There was neither time nor geography , only his truth  --  and that is love and forgiveness . " " Is that it ? " " So it seems to me . And it did not matter who those people were , nor what they wore . They might have dressed as we are today . . . . " His cry of amazement interrupted her . " But I did n't tell you , did I ? They were dressed like folk today . Even in my dream , I marvelled . Jazan ! You have had the same dream ! Jerkin and breeches , beaver hat and Monmouthcap , and every man of them in red knit stockings . Our Lord was arrayed , even as I , in black silk . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , no , I can not say  --  and yet . . . as you talked , it seemed as if I too had dreamed , and forgotten . . . ' t was all familiar to me . " She could see the wastes of sand , so much more golden than the ones around Boston , the red knit stockings , and the Monmouthcaps . The haunting memory of a forgotten dream . . . floating back to her and yet not coming wholly to the surface of her mind . " I ca n't remember ! " she cried in despair . She felt his hand closing upon her wrist like a vice . He whispered , " Who are you ? " She thought he had gone mad . " Oh , sir , " she said , " I am Jazan Parre , Jude Parre 's daughter . Oh , you have suffered too much . You are sick . But you know me , Jazan Parre . " " I know your name , and who your father is . But who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often and often , to my dreams ? And now today  --  in the flesh  --  with your loving belief in me ? "  | Their faces were not eight inches apart . Unflinchingly , she returned his gaze . Her face , damp with heat , was set with a frown of concentration . Through the dark iris  --  brown , flecked with yellow , like sunlight on a forest brook  --  he could gaze down into some unknown depth . He felt if he could but see far enough he would know the secret of the world . Never had he seen such eyes . Naked soul to naked soul , their eyes met in an intimacy as great as naked body pressed to naked body . To both of them , the day had been beyond all endurance . The young girl was shaken by some new emotion . He said in a choking voice , " God will send you to me again , Jazan Parre , in the flesh or in my dreaming . " Instantly , he relinquished her hand , turned , and was gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned red . She felt as if she had given something of herself that never could she take back again . That dream they had both had ( for now she was sure she could remember those wastes of golden sand and the men 's legs in their red knit stockings ) . . . . And it was she who had led him into the presence of our Lord ! At last Gervase found her . She was sitting quietly by old Blackstone 's spring , washing her face and arms in the water and coaxing the ducklings . She seemed exhausted , but content . The quiet eyes she raised to him were uncanny and inhuman . He was afraid for her . They made him think of the eyes of mortal maids that fairies tempt away , and when they do come back once more to their own roof-trees , never again are they the same . AN outcome of the branding was Christopher 's marriage to Salome Blue . This was done with no more than half-heartedp225consent from the young people . Neither seemed , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fathers decided for them . The banns were waived , and the new judge , Colonel Coffin , registered their vows three days after the return from Boston . Goody Blue had at last the satisfaction of seeing her daughter married to a Parre and set up as mistress at Founder 's  --  fine addition and all . Fenton had sworn he would not live there longer with his wife , who henceforth was to bide at Paradise . Salome went bravely to work setting all things in order . She was up at dawn , scouring and polishing , mending , spinning , baking and brewing , knitting , weaving , and washing . She made poultices for her husband 's forehead , so that it healed neatly . She nursed the sick mind that had been handed over to her care . Unloved , and all but unwanted , she clung to him , and she saved him from almost certain despair . But sometimes , as her young husband ' slept by her side , she was filled with anguish at the position in which she now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not endure to see that he thought only of Bathsheba . She had asked no promise of him , but he had told her that never again , as far as he was able , would he speak to this woman he believed he had so harmed . Every day he asked his wife concerning her . Salome , who once had been so voluble to his questions , now answered him meagrely . Yes , Bathsheba had been in a great taking when Fenton had gone away to lay out the new road beyond Ipswich for the General Court . Yes , Fenton had kissed her good-bye . No , her scar was not well healed . No , she did not think Goody Goad was putting a corrosive in the dressing . Hagar was offended to have her and her disgrace about . Jazan was kinder to her than formerly.  |p226No  , she did not think this was because Jazan was learning to love her . It was compassion only . She did not think Bathsheba 's forehead was so slow a-healingbecause she had such a delicate skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish her thought . Everyone in Canaan believedthat the difference in the mending of the man 's and woman 's brand was God 's way of showing who was the guiltier of the two . Of course , it was a heavy blow to his father . And being asked to resign as Judge . . . that was a heavy blow . True , he seemed sad and moping . He ate badly , it was true . And played softly upon the flute . Every direct question she answered patiently , but for his vague words of love for another woman she had no answer . She never criticized Bathsheba but now she knew she hated her . Hate was a new emotion for this kindly woman . She had no words in which to express it , although love and admiration she could express with a tedious nicety . By night she prayed for strength to endure but one day more , and with the new day strength always came . Smiling a little inanely , she went about her work  --  but her face had a corroded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were wearing it away . Christopher , in his shame , would go nowhere ; not even to Paradise , or to meeting , although Colonel Coffin fined him for absence from Sabbath service . At the end of six months , Salome was almost in despair over him , for now that he had become hers , she wanted nothing more than his happiness . He seemed to live yet in a tired maze , but the colour was coming back to his cheeks and his hair had lost the hempen look it had when first he had left the gaol . She saw that with the Indians he felt self-confident . The Indians saw no shame in that purple A. Probably they admired it . That winter she devised errands forp227him that would take him to Swamp Town . In confidence , she begged Totonic to come to them often . One evening she questioned Totonic about his own language , and a discussion began between Christopher and the young sachem about the formation of plurals . Christopher became animated . Salome , as if knowing that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set split peas to soak . In his Harvard days , in spite of the conversations he often had with Mr. Eliot as the Upbiblum God had been going through the press , he had scorned anything so barbarous as the native tongues . Now he seized upon them . His days , that had been empty , suddenly were full . He worked with the help of his Swamp Town friends on the Algonquin tongue . His system of reducing it to writing must be compared to Mr. Eliot 's . In May , the kind old Roxbury missionary to the Indians rode out to call upon him . He told amusing mistakes he had made in his own early translations . The two men laughed heartily together . For the first time in ten months , Christopher seemed himself . He had ruffed up his hair , forgetting the scar his hand ran over . He had his pipe in one hand and a tankard of ale in the other . How handsome , vigorous and young , he looked ! And his nose was pointing with interest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unnoticed , to her bed . She had reason to be thankful for that night , for she was sure she conceived . With that genius for the ridiculous that some of the most praiseworthy people have , she immediately told her great news to everyone ; from Goody Goad , who in time would be her midwife , to Orde , the taverner , who had grown so deaf she had to shout her glad tidings ( and the horse-boy and the neighbouring smith , Preserved English , and his son , Mercuricus , and the serving-maids , all tittering ) . Christopher felt ashamed . He brutally told her she was to talk no more of this matter . It made him feel ridiculous that child of his might come to maturity in that lean , unloved body . Jesu ! Who but Salome would go so instantly with child ! It seemed to him that she was so crazy for children  --  in some way so full of them  --  you had to give her but the least excuse , and here they came ! In those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But this time Salome was wrong . She did not conceive for some months later . All this stir had been ( so Goody Goad told her ) wind and the vapours only . Through his irritations and his yearnings for Bathsheba , there was but one security in Christopher 's life , one reality , and that was his wife . When she begged him , he began going to meeting . To please her , they went to call on Parson Redbank . He took her on a pillion to Sudbury once . It was Paradise where he was most loath to go . His father 's eyes , Bathsheba 's eyes  --  these he could not meet . But even there she got him to go . And when he covertly glanced at Bathsheba , she would turn away her face . Bathsheba seemed to have no idea that Salome 's feelings had changed towards her  --  or perhaps what she had always felt had now come to the top . She was still fair enough , but she looked her thirty-three years . As long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had been eight years younger . With the common knowledge of her true age , she seemed to age to meet it . Her hair she cut about her forehead so that it almost covered the ugly mark , which the executioner had , with some kindness , placed high . But when the locks blew aside , it was a shocking thing to see . The scar had puckered and seemed to draw the whole forehead into its whirlpool . To the horror of Goody Goad and Hagar , Bathsheba tookp229it for granted that now , as wife of the absent eldest son , she was mistress of Paradise . On Sabbath , she entered the women 's pew first . She sat herself next to Mr. Parre at the head of the table . When visitors came , she made them welcome and ordered food and drink . Her brand and her history were embarrassing to many , and they tried to ignore her . She would not be ignored . With her handsome clothes and condescending manner she seemed to insist that not only did she exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt a grudging admiration for her gallantness in the face of such disgrace . She might be untruthful , unchaste , moody , vain , and idle , but she had grit . Fenton came and went , and came again . He and his wife treated each other with studied courtesy , like stately folk moving through a gavotte . Each time after he was gone , Bathsheba would have days and nights of tears and terror . Sometimes all day long she would not bother to dress herself , but go about in slippers , a whittle pulled over her night-rail , pacing the house , moaning and wordless . Sometimes , after having seen Fenton , she would be gone all day to the wildwood , and no one knew what it was she did there . THE year after the branding , Goody Goad was beside herself to find a proper female servant . Soon harvest would be upon them , and when this was over Bessie Thirst  --  whom Goody Goad said she never had seen , in the ten years she had worked at Paradise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a journeyman tinker . One day in bright September , Jazan was sitting under YellowClay 's oak , weaving coloured garters on a knee-loom she held between her knees . She heard the dogs bark , the gate open , and turned to see who had come . It was Gervase Blue . He had gone that day to Sudbury to collect a ram that had been promised Paradise in exchange for so much English corn . The ram he had not , but proudly astride his saddle was a big , smiling girl . Gervase walked beside the horse . He walked as though bringing home a prize . Jazan 's mind went back to that other day , so long ago . She had sat beneath this same old oak and had seen another man bring home his woman ; the rolling storm , the flying stallion , Fenton 's broad shoulders and scarlet cape  --  and Bathsheba upon the pillion . A very parody of that romantic entrance did the placid arrivalof Gervase and the stout girl seem . But Jazan knew that when Gervase should bring home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of something for her . She was half afraid when she went , at last , into the kitchen ; afraid the servant would be announcing his wife . He was nineteen now . Why should he not marry if he wished ? Jazan 's nails bit her palms . " I had heard , ma'am , where I was  --  over in Marlborough  --  that you was looking out for a female servant , and so I put my aprons in this bundle and set out to walk over and see if I 'd suit , " the young woman was saying . Even Goody Goad looked impressed with her energy . " You planned to walk all the way ? " " Yes , ma'am , and then him overtook me in Sudbury , and says I could ride his horse and he 'd walk . " A roguish look came into her small eyes , " And so here we are , " she announced . " Dear me , I must think things over . But at least you may spend the night . How old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " " Sixteen , ma'am , but I 'm very strong . Do you see that chest there ? I can pick it up . " Full of linen as it was ; she graspedp231it and lifted it a foot off the floor . Then stood back , panting . " I can do anything , " she admitted . The Goodwife pursed her lips , shook her head-cloth , and jingled her keys . " I doubt that , " she said severely ; but she had known , the second Gervase brought Phoebe Bemis to her , that this was the one she was seeking . " And tomorrow I 'll go away right after breakfast if you decide you do n't like me . " But by tomorrow it was plain that Phoebe had come to stay . She was a good-natured , honest wench , full bosomed and quick to sweat . She loved everybody , and soon became an importantmember of the household  --  which , without her , would have seemed a little downcast . Bathsheba liked her and always called for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chocolate , an affectation she had picked up in London . Occasionally Hagar would sit the obliging creature upon a stool and read to her from the Bible . Phoebe loved this , and never questioned her commentaries . Jazan liked to take her into the woods when she gathered candle-wood or oak leaves for baking bread , flagrootand herbs for Goody Goad 's medicines . It was always Phoebe who saw when Gervase came in from his work too late for the general meal , and immediately there was something hot and appetizing set out on the kitchen table . Phoebe enjoyed everything and everybody . She was no beauty , and her skin was a little coarse and greyish . Immediatelyshe started a number of slightly comic flirtations , for she had a ready laugh and unbounded affection . Sometimes it did seem like having a large , loving dog drooling all over you . She flirted with young Jack Truly and even old Goodman Goad . She flirted with Christopher and Mr. Parre . She laughed at Mercuricus English until she had to throw her apron over her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She flirted with all the Blue boys , from Paul , who was betrothed to PriscillaHurlingheart , to meagre Abraham . Wherever she went , she was followed by jokes and laughter . Yet any but the dullest man must know that she was a good girl . She was so banal with everyone that no one could take her attentions seriously . Goody Goad was well content . She knew that she would , with years , outgrow her frolicking and become a worthy successor to herself . Already Gervase was quietly taking over the work of the ancient steward . Now Phoebe would in time take Goody Goad 's place . Quite as obviously , in time these two should marry , and Paradise would continue through the next generationthe great estate it had always been . It may have been she put the idea into Phoebe 's head , for the girl had been at Paradisebut a month when she announced she was going to marry Gervase Blue . The other servants laughed . Let her try ! Gervasewas known to be unapproachable to women ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parre who , althoughshe never might marry him herself , was keeping him back . So Phoebe told everyone , including the man of her choice , that in a year she would marry Gervase Blue . It became at once a prime joke and an accepted fact . Jazan , sitting in the hall with Hagar and Bathsheba , would hear the hearty laughter when Gervase came into the kitchen . " You watch out now , Master Gervase . I 've said I 'm going to marry you , and I do what I say . " And amazingly , in some of her exuberant fits , she would fling down her work and chase him about the kitchen . If she caught him , she was going to put him in a basket and carry him over to the magistrate 's and marry him . Gervase , no matter how tired he was when be came in , would enter good-naturedly into this game , which seemed unlike his own nature . Off would he skip , with thep233cheerful wench in hot pursuit . Stools and forms would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parre came out of the great chamber where he spent much time , and laughed to see them . The Goodwife , in spite of the strict discipline she usually kept , could not find words to reprove the lively and overgrown child . It seemed to her that Gervase would be fortunate indeed with such a wife . His own temperament was too remote and controlled . Phoebe made him more what he should be . This frank pursuit of Gervase by Phoebe and all the talk it caused had its effect upon Jazan . She saw that to everyone , except herself only , it seemed a proper match . She believed she could love no one but Gervase and that she never might love him . The worst of the matter was that it was he who would not have it . How well her father had understood the difference between the shameless , reckless blood of the Parres and the pride of the nameless servant ! Both Fenton and Christopherhad proved how headstrong they were in love . And her father as well by the disgrace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have proved the same . The happy chance was not hers . Gervase saw to that . At times Jazan showed a sad and simple dignity , fitting to a woman hopelessly in love . But at times she was feckless and wild . In these moods she turned to Mercuricus English , the smith 's son . The volatile little man was strong as though forged on his own anvil and a light-hearted lover , for he loved no one person  --  only love . He taught the young girl the cynical truth that kisses and embraces from the wrong man ( as he knew himself to be ) are better than none at all . But no one seeing her innocent bland little face would guess that any man had taught her anything.  |p234IN  the fall of ' 68 the General Court once more found reason to send a delegation to King Charles II , answering certain charges of disloyalty brought against this most troublesome of colonies . Four eminent men , no longer young  --  whom it was felt could pull the wool over the King 's eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly selected . For the fifth , they considered once more sending old Peter Fearing . No man among them had a more dominating personality . Mr. Fearing appeared to the Governor . He said of late his health had been so grievous he doubted he had strength for the journey , but surely if they bade him go , go he would . Then he pointed out to them a thing they had not thought on before . The four men already selected were old like himself . Like himself , they were English born and bred . And this was true of most of the delegations the Bay had sent to London . Would it not be well that a young man , utterly indigenous to this new land , be sent to his Majesty to show the type of manhood the Colony could breed ? " We have sent samples of our timber and cider , fish , cattle , and flax , grains and pipe staves ; but of our greatest crop , the human crop , we have sent little enough . I think to include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home-grown manhood would be wise . " It was in this way he asked that Forethought be sent instead . His poor lad had not been himself of late . The Governor and the Council knew what the old man had in mind . After his departure they discussed the matter a little and , on the whole , agreed with Mr. Fearing . It was almost decided that Forethought should go instead of his father . Bellingham suggested another name.  | " Why not Captain Parre ? " All saw the wisdom of the suggestion . The four greybeards would pull the wool . The young man would be such an exhibitas they were shrewd enough to see would impress their king . It would give a subtle suggestion that the Colony had plenty of young fighting men , was not inhabited merely by theologians . The King ( in his present mood ) must realize the military arts were not neglected in his profitless overseas possession . Young Parre was doubtless the very man . He would be welcomed in military circles and would come back a more valuableofficer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no young man with more aristocratic manner than this same Young Parre . This would have surprised the Canaanites , who had too often seen him lolling about with bare chest and in Indian drawers . It was Bellingham who swung the decision . In spite of his cold eyes and supercilious manner , he had never forgotten Jude Parre 's face at the time , a year and more ago , that he had lost his judgeship through the wickednessof one of his own sons . He was glad to bestow this honour upon the other son , partly to please the old gentleman . It was not until mid-winter they would sail . But Peter Fearing , when they told him , was filled with an ungodlywrath . He cried upon God to witness the destruction of his " New Jerusalem , " the apostasy of the Governor and his Council . He would not listen to the explanations made to him . He only knew that his dear boy , his Forethought , had been set at naught . Of greater merit , as a sample @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " wild hyena " from Canaan ! Forethought ( who had been told by his father that he was to be sent and was looking forward to this visit to the homeland of his parents ) took the news gently , trying to soothe the old man so he would not fall again into one of his painful heart to this had he ever felt such utter contentment . " If this be second childhood , I am delighted to meet you , sir . " In those days of his boyhood he had been enchanted with poetry . Poetry and childhood , poetry and boyhood  --  but for his maturitythere had been no poetry . Lines he had forgotten came back to him as he gazed about the fields : " How many goodly creatures are there here ! How beauteous mankind is ! 0 brave new world , That has such people i n't ! " Long ago had he learned those words , and then he had believedthem  --  " goodly creatures , " " beauteous mankind , " " 0 brave new world ! " Disillusionment had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . Now , as he stood upon the hay wain and gazed about him , he saw that they were true . The world was brave . . . mankind good and beautiful . And for years he had not known . Not since he had been twelve or so , and now was he seventy-three . For sixty years he had lived in darkness . Now , thank God , he saw ! The hay was coming up too fast for the boy at the back of the load to handle , but in a dream Mr. Parre let the team pull on . The haymakers shouted to him , asking him to pause for them . " You sunburned sicklemen , of August weary , Come hither from the furrow , and be merry : Make holiday : your rye-straw hats put on And these fresh nymphs encounter every one In country footing . " " The Tempest " . . . that was the name of this old poetry . And was it not in that same play one reads : " We are such stuff as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . our littlep239life . . . " He could not finish the verses , and suddenly he woke to the confusion his day-dreaming had brought to the haymakers . He wound the reins about a stake in the wain , seized a fork , and jumped back to help the boy . The welltrained , heavily laden horses slowly continued their way . No one saw what happened next . Mr. Parre either lost his footing or became dizzy and fell . No one saw him fall , but those nearest him heard a short exclamation of surprise , and there he lay , face down upon the stubble . It was a shock to see a man of his age and dignity flung thus , no matter how gently , to the ground . But he could not be much hurt . It was Seth Bailey , the Younger , who reached him first . " That was hard luck , sir . May I help you up ? " Gervase , sensing danger through the love he bore , flung down his fork . " Master ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that his blood was running furiously , seeping through dry roots , following tiny pathways of mouse and mole . Mr. Parre had fallen on top of his two-tined mowing-fork . The ferocious weapon had pierced his lungs through into his heart . Mr. Parre looked about him diffidently , as though realizing the shocking spectacle he was . Then he seemed to smile . His face contorted , and he coughed an ocean of blood from blue lips . A new look  --  not of pathetic shame , but of wonder  --  crossed his face . His limbs twitched , and he was dead . BLACK , black everywhere ! The black catafalque , the silver skull and cross-bones on the black pall . Black streamers tied to the dead man 's sword above the hall hearth . The family in black , the neighbours in black . Black gloved and clad were the eminent men of the Colony , who had come to do last honoursto the dead . The black enamelled mourning-rings . The garlands upon the doors of the house and upon the beehives . Waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they too had silver skulls and cross-bones upon foreheads and loins . Mr. Parre would be the first citizen of Canaan to be drawn by horses to his grave . All others had gone on the shoulders of the mourners . But a hearse had been in some way contrived after Agnes 's arrival , for she knew by now how great folk should be buried . The paint on it was not yet dry . It was she who had thought to bring out from Boston with her all this panoply of plumes and mourning gear . Jazan was afraid that the impressive ( but somewhat makeshift ) hearse might fall apart . The four black horses were unused to pulling together and disliked the flapping of their mourning garments about their knees . They might bolt . This hearse was the first wheeled vehicle , not designed for farm labour , ever seen in Canaan . One might say it was the first pleasure vehicle  --  and God grant it stay together ! The arrival of Agnes and Jonathan had been a great relief to Paradise . Jazan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the funeral was over . Mostly she minded Fidelia , Agnes 's daughter , and Waitstill , the baby . Hagar was suspicious that there was something papish about such elaboration , but she bowed to Agnes 's authority . Interminably , the service had gone on . Speeches had been made . Poems read . Elegiacs pinned to the pall . And soon , now , the coffin would be carried to the waiting hearse . Mr. Richard Mather of Roxbury had come out , riding with the Governor , to deliver the funeral oration . Mr. Redbank was considered too infirm . A few weeks before he had suffered a shock . Hep241walked only with the aid of his grand-daughter , Rue , and a stout servant . Jazan had heard Governor Bellingham say in a low voice to the gentleman sent all the way from Ipswich , " Jude Parre might have been the greatest man among us . " He might have been ? Why was he not ? What secret dam had always lain across his life ? The young mourning woman could not fathom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always existed in her father . Outside she could see the back of one of the horses , and Gervase standing by , trying to keep the flustered creatures in control . I wonder what Father would think of all this ? I think he might be pleased to see how the whole Colony honour him . Even Peter Fearing who , I think , hated him , sent a poem to pin on the pall . This was her constant thought , as the long ceremonywore on . How would he , who lay waxen and washed in his coffin , take these goings-on ? Like an enigma he lay there , with shut and sunken eyes . In the last twenty-four hours ( for the funeral had been set at the last possible moment , so that a distinguished group of mourners could gather ) Mr. Parre had begun , slightly but unmistakably , to smile . The first look of youthful wonder had left his face and had given place to this more arresting expression . Mr. Parre lay in the midst of all this pomp , seeming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have suited him better to have been buried three days ago ; before it was necessary to bring in such vast quantities of the pungent sweet fern , that lovely herb which  --  for sinister reasons  --  was often used in the death chamber . Mr. Redbank was sitting rather unnaturally , with his square head of coarse , grey curls a little on one side . Tears , without stopping , had streamed from his eyes . There seemed to be neither beginning nor ending , effort or passion  --  and certainly no shame  --  in these tears . Rue sat quietly beside him . She was furious that this old friend of Mr. Parre 's had been consideredtoo infirm to deliver more than the opening prayer . But even Rue was shocked when , the service at last over and the bearers about to pick up the dead man , her grandfather , gently but with authority , said he wished to be alone for a few momentswith the dead man 's sons and daughters . He would like to speak to them in the presence of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there sat the old Pastor , smilingslightly , but expecting obedience . A little awkwardly , they all filed out , the Governor going first and Rue , reluctantly , last . There were left , gathered about the semi-paralyzed man , Jonathan Fayrweather , with Fidelia moping upon his lap ; Agnes , with the baby , Waitstill ; Christopherand his wife , Salome ; Fenton , with his beautiful branded lady ; Jazan ; and Hagar . The old man addressed himself to Fenton , who had been black , moody , and of little use since his father 's death . " Fenton , " he said simply , " you are now the head of this house and the master of Paradise . I wish to ask you , in God 's name and in the name of this good man  --  my old friend and your dead father  --  in the future to carry yourself in such way as befits your new responsibility . You have wrought much shame upon this house . First by marrying an ill-chosen woman behind your father 's back and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold her in proper control . You are like the man who starts a fire , goes off , and lets it spread to his brother 's fields . I hold you more deserving of that fearsome brand upon the brow than either of these two unfortunates . " Fenton 's chin rested upon his clenched fists . He stared , withoutresentment and without curiosity , at the aged speaker.  |p243There  was no hostility in that dark and level gaze . Bathsheba began to cry . " And now , before your father 's open coffin , in the presence of his dead body , I exhort you to a more ordered way of life . For God has called your father , and has turned over to you the controlling of your younger brother 's and sisters ' affairs . . . and the lives of certain servants , both men and women . I beg you , stand up now and accept with humble dignity that weight he has laid upon you . Of Agnes , I hardly need to speak . She now has the protection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mitigate the harm which you have already done to him and to Salome  --  and to your wife , Bathsheba ; order well your life in regard to them . They deserve consideration from you , for they have suffered from you . " Salome giggled nervously . " Hagar  --  she is sickly and weak . Care for her frail body and nurture in her that soul which is greater than the body . Jazan  --  I know you love her . God guard her , and teach you how best to fend for her . Now let me think . . . there were two or three matters I had on my mind during all those tedious long speeches and poems . ' T is hard to find the words . . . but I wish you to understand what it was your father and this house , Paradise , stood for , since the founding of Canaan . It was justice for all  --  rich and poor , white man and red  --  food and drink and a roof for all who were in need . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disregard always of what they would think , " he gestured towards the open door beyond which the great gentlemen waited about the hearse , " for he stood forth a man . Upon his two feet he stood , and dealt fairly and kindly by all ! I beg of you children of Jude Parre to live in accord and be honourable one with another , and do not forget nor neglect the great tradition of Paradise . "  |p244Then  he signed to them that they should kneel , and thanked God that such a man as Jude Parre had ever been upon this earth  --  admitting that it was the right of him who gave also to take away ( blessed is the name of the Lord )  --  and begged forgiveness if at that moment it seemed too hard to bear this loss . Between Elizabeth and Fidelia , they buried him  --  back of the meeting-house . Beside the first wife were Anselm , Rufus , and Will , those English posies that could not live away from hedgerows and primroses . But Fidelia had been alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr. Parre . ONE evening , through a welter of drifts and cold , Fenton Parre arrived at his own gate . With him were four men . They were wrapped in furs and leather , with woollen caps upon their heads and heavy hawling gloves upon their hands . The sunset light was pink about them . The horses were led away to the barns , and the five riders piled into the house . They seemed to fill all Paradise with their good humour . Fenton , calling for Phoebe to pull off his great boots and bring him a pair of moccasins , announced that in three days he must sail with the delegation to England . " I 'm here for but one night only , so let it be a night ! These friends came to bear me company . And this Jan Royalle  --  he is so fresh out from England , he has never seen such snows before . " He indicated a slender fellow with a deceptively girlishface . " We thought we 'd show Jan Royalle . . . " Everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The hall fire must be built up with the largest logs . Royalle had never seen such hearths in England . The table/board must be set up again in the hall so that Royalle could see how good country food was in the New World . Fenton , walking up and down , passing from hall to kitchen and back again to hall , threw everything into happy confusion . With his coming , Paradise burst into life once more . Sad tnd a little dour had it been since Mr. Parre 's death . The farm servants were busy with the fires . It took four men to drag in a log great enough to suit the master 's whim . A barrel of rum was rolled out . The Goodwife was scurrying about like an old , harassed white rabbit , popping up and down the ladder to the cellar , her voice of command ringing out through the laughter of the men , the chatter of the women . The dignity Bathsheba had maintained in her husband 's absence now left her . She alone , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she looked badly . The skull emerged through the delicacy of her face . She fawned upon her husband a little . True , he had introduced her as his wife . He had kissed her , but he had kissed Jazan and Goody Goad and Hagar  --  and especially Phoebe  --  as well . When Gertrude and Sheepshead came in for a moment , he paid more heed to these dogs than to her . " So you are going to England , " she said and laughed bitterly . " And for how long , sir ? " Fenton said he would not return with the other delegates . It would be fall before he came back . He would do business for his brother Fayrweather . " Plenty to eat and much to drink , my Goodwife , " Fenton was commanding . " I stopped at Orde 's and told the boy there to go about to certain houses and invite folk to come drink my health . " Fenton took his jews ' harp from his pocket and struck up the rollicking ( and ribald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her name is Sis . " Like most Indian traders , he could play the jews ' harp . It took no skill but only knack . Even Indians quickly learned to play it and would give the finest beaver for a jews ' harp . The men hummed the old catch , which they had been singing ever since their last drink at Sudbury . They were either too well bred , or too sober , to sing the words in the presence of ladies . The hall began to fill with the rich smell of meats and drink . Hams , smoked with beech wood , and venison , just the right age ; a mighty rabbit pie ; cold ducks ; mincemeat , rich in brandy and suet ; hot yellow journey cakes ; home-made cheeses the size of a baby 's head ; and white baker 's bread were piled upon the board . Fenton took a tankard of beer , sweetened it with molasses , and flavoured it with rum . Into this the flip-dog , heated red hot in the fire , was plunged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristic odour of burning . Tankard after tankard of this hot flip Fenton prepared . The smell of it mixed with the smell of food and the wet garmentsof the men , the bear 's grease on their boots . The sober rafters echoed with such shouts as had not been heard for many a year . The jews ' harp buzzed and thwanged whenever Fenton had a free hand for it . Before the men had finished their supper  --  and they ate enormously  --  the guests began to arrive . Goody Goad shook her head . She saw that not only was everyone willing to drink the health of Fenton but to eat them out of house and home . Twenty , thirty . . . she was losing track of the new-comers , and they all seemed somewhat hungry and very thirsty . She sent Phoebe to the cellar to bring up a basket of dried herrings . This , however , did not assuage hunger , and it did increase thirst . And round and round , from hand to hand , the jacks of cold ale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went constantly from the embers into the beer.  |p247To  the surprise of everyone , Christopher and Salome came over from Founder 's . Christopher still avoided company . Seeingthat Bathsheba was in the hall , he kept to the kitchen . He wanted to ask his brother about some details of the Algonquin language . Was it true that the Tarratines , in speaking of a woman , use one word and the Nipmucs another ? He had brought a sheaf of papers with him . Fenton sat beside him for a moment at the kitchen table . He answered these pedantic questions absent-mindedly . Christopher inked his pen and wrote down what he said . Salome fussed about him like a hen with one chick . When Fenton asked his brother about the harvest that fall , Salome answered for him . She seemed to wish to take even so small a burden from her husband 's shoulders . Too good to him , thought Fenton . He looked at her with curiosity . He saw she was gazing through the open door into the hall . Bathsheba sat by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the noisy merriment . Fascinated and in silence , Salome stared at her . There seemed to be no hatred in Salome 's eyes . Only when at last Mercuricus English , the wiry young smith , hid her from view did she turn her eyes away . " How soon will your baby come , Salome ? " he asked . Her face brightened . " Oh , I do n't know . . . ' t is now my fourth month . . . I know I have felt him kicking . I 'm so afraid . . . . Goody tells me that women who are in too great hurry for their children often bear them early , so I try not to think of him . I pretend to myself that he wo n't be born until a year from now . " " Jesu , I hope not ! " said Fenton heartily . Salome already looked on the point of bearing her child that night . That summer she had indeed conceived , but she had raised such a deal of talk over her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Immediately , she hadp248begun to show the disfigurement of her condition . She whispered to her brother-in-law , " Kit does not like me to talk about it . . . I can not imagine why . Should you not think he would be proud  --  proud even as am I ? " Soon Fenton got away and joined his guests . Jan Royalle , in spite of his modest , diffident manner , was the centre of the group in the hall . Everyone who met this teachable young man seemed to feel a personal responsibility to explain how things were done in the new land . A little heavily , Paul Blue told him about the Indians . The miller had made him a dissertation on the grinding of Indian corn . The miller was slightly unsteady . He had come with all his sons , but his wife had not come . She resented the position of importance Gervase now had at Paradise . Seth Bailey , the Younger , whom his father had commanded to court Jazan Parre , was scheming with the young girl how he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father would never know . He had long loved Rue Redbank , and Jazan often helped him cover his tracks . " You ought to have one more flip , Seth , " Jazan was saying . " I never saw you so handsome and bold before . Tonight , I think you will court Rue as she deserves . " " ' T is hard courting on cold water , " Seth agreed . This one sentence rang out over the rest of the hubbub , and everyone laughed . Hairy little Mercuricus had clung to Jazan 's side , as he always did on public occasions . By his manner , he seemed to announce himself her chosen man . She did not resent this . They understood each other well . Priscilla Hurlingheart , although she had come with her father and two younger sisters , now suddenly demanded of Paul Blue that he take her home . She had had a wretched evening . For the first time she was jealous of Addie , her fifteen-year-old sister . Addie had not beenp249sent to England for a fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer could . " My head aches , Paul , and I want to go home . " Like many pretty coquettes , Priscilla had in her the making of a shrew . Paul stopped awkwardly in the midst of his dissertationto Jan Royalle . " I 'll take you home , Priscilla , " her father offered tentatively . He had in his eyes that half-ashamed , half-arrogant look that often comes with years of failure . The girl 's black eyes snapped . It was not only an escort home that she wanted , but a public proof that she was able to take a young man away from his companions . Jazan went into the kitchen , for the moment rid of Mercuricus . She wished Christopher and Salome would leave . They seemed out of place . She , as well as Fenton , had noticed how Salome 's eyes continually felt through the door and rested upon the silent , almost forgotten Bathsheba , sitting enthroned in Mr. Parre 's wainscoted chair . " Salome , in your condition , should you not go early to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters a wife must follow her husband . And I never can get to sleep until Christopher comes in . " " That is true , " said Christopher . " She is always wide awake until I come to bed . " This common wifely tyranny had often forced him from his work . He found that his mind was never so fresh as after his wife had gone to bed , and yet , no matter how tired she might be , she always stayed awake until he joined her . Priscilla , upon Paul 's strong arm , was making her la-de-da , English-learnt farewell . The Dillinghams and the Miller Blue were also leaving . Jazan saw that now the bulk of the guests would go . A roar swept up through the hall . She saw Phoebe ,  |p250with  one stout arm about Gervase 's neck , the other flung out dramatically . " ' T is a fight to the death between us , my Masters . For I 've said I will marry him , and Goody Goad says yes . But this Gervase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " yelled Fenton , for no servant might marry without his master 's sanction . " And a good match it will be , my dearie , for I am making Gervase steward here , in name as well as fact . Goodman Goad tells me that he wishes to lay down the job . " Three days after Mr. Parre 's funeral , Goodman Goad had fallen from a loft and broken his hip . In time it would mend and he would go about a little , helped by two canes , but his usefulness as steward was over . Gervase was congratulated on his new position , but it seemed almost like congratulations for Phoebe as well . The kitchen was cold after the suffocating heat of the hall . Jazan shivered a little . " But he says he wo n't marry me ! " cried Phoebe . " I 'll bet on Phoebe . " " I 'll bet on Gervase . " Jazan noticed that the silent Gervase made no effort to extricate himself from the crook of the heavy arm . Instead , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men than I. " " We are all better men , " cried Captain Wolcott , who had come out from Boston . He was a man of over forty , bald , heavy , and badly spoken of that he preferred the riotous company of men so much younger than himself , to that of his mature wife and grown-up sons in Roxbury . The famous Cluff the Bear pulled her arm away from Gervase and smacked herp251on the mouth . Under her coarse , grey skin , the girl blushed furiously . Tom Pigge had brought his fiddle with him , and now the drinkers called for a tune . They would dance , they said . In the kitchen , Salome bent sidewise in pain . She had always been somewhat dyspeptic , but since she had been with child she insisted that any pain which formerly she had called the vapours now came from her condition . Jazan seized the chance to send them home . " ' T is my fourth month only . No one ever miscarried in a fourth month . Goody , you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaning back on a form by the kitchen hearth . All her busy life she had been accustomed to sleeping when she might , and now that there was nothing more to be done for her master she had thrown her apron over her face , and slept . She woke , hearing herself addressed , and immediately , as doctor and midwife to the community , offered to attend the nervous lady to her home and even pass the night with her . After they were gone , Jazan went into the hall . It was blazinghot , but cold as two icicles that will not melt Abraham Blue and Hagar sat stiffly , side by side , disapproving all they saw . Bathsheba was still sitting in Mr. Parre 's great-chair , a pale hand resting on each chair arm , her face thrown back and her eyes closed . The hair was disordered about her face , and through the glittering curls the purple brand stood out , dominatingher whole face . Tom Pigge struck up the strains of " An Old Man 's a Bed of Bones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tolly Polly . " Then Mercuricus demanded the " Cushion Dance . " So the fid/dle picked up the jig , Tom yelling in triumph . First Mercuricusdanced alone , a cushion in his hands . " This dance it will no further go , " he sang , at a signal from the fiddler . " I pray you , good sir , why say you so ? " sang Pigge . " Because Jazan Parre will not come too . " " She must come too , whether she will or no . " Mercuricus laid the cushion before the Jazan knew the old steps . The jigging of the fiddle went through her blood . She stood up to dance . She made a pretty picture , with her dark hair shaking upon her shoulders , her lithe body responding to the rhythms of the violin . And she sang out the few words in a clear but rather childish voice . At the end her pillow was at Jan Royalle 's feet . " Because Jan Royalle will not come too . " Instantly the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissed her fairly on the mouth , although anyone to look at him would have thought him more likely to choose a brow . Jazan was surprised . She had purposely not chosen Gervase , although he was there . Jan chose Phoebe . And what a spectacle she was , dancing alone , sweating at every pore , her big bosom bounding ! She called loudly for Gervase , but he had left the room rather than see the stranger 's lips touch Jazan 's . She threw the cushion before Fenton , who embraced her warmly . He stood up , threw back his hair , and did steps that only a few of the men and Jazan herself knew were closer to Indian dancing than to the old English jigging . There was no woman left for Fenton to choose but Hagar  --  who was shocked and angry at this lewd game  --  a very dingy and respectablep253servant , and his own wife , sitting like an ivory statue in his father 's great-chair . He selected Bathsheba . As the woman 's eyes opened and she saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had looked disintegrated , came together . She accepted his kiss up ) n her cheek and a little slowly got to her feet . Tall and stately , she stood before them all , like some woman risen from the grave . She let Tom Pigge play the opening bars twice , then signalled to him that he played too fast . Slowly she began to dance . It was unlike anything Jazan had ever seen before . Instead of letting her arms hang down like a sailor loosely footing a hornpipe , she kept them bent at the elbow , her hands raised to the level of her shoulders . Her whole body was held with the most delicate precision , and yet from her emanated a curious lasciviousness that made Jazan 's bright steps and Phoebe 's calf-like gambols seem colourless . Her shoulders moved little , but her hips , under the voluminous rust silk of her skirt , followed the flow of the music . The long , white neck was held at its customary angle . Her face was wildly beautiful . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cushion before him , she went perversely back to the first line . Tom Pigge humoured her . Suddenly she stopped short in her tracks . Her hands came down and were folded at her waist . She looked about her imperiously . " This dance it will no further go . " She did not sing the words , but said them with a final air , walked gracefully to the great-chair , and sat herself down . Not only her words but her fine performance had ended the dance . And then , it was true , the next man would have been forced to choose between Hagar and the grubby servingwoman.  | Tom Pigge was still sawing at his fiddle , and Phoebe , Mercuricus , and Captain Wolcott were doing a few half-hearted steps in the middle of the hall . After Bathsheba , nothing would have persuaded Jazan to stand up again . She had , until that moment , looked upon dancing as a clumsy hopping . Bathsheba sat in tragic isolation . Her brand and her mood embarrassed the guests , who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of the townsfolk only a half dozen remained , and these all men . Some of them Jazan did not like . Then , too , she was afraid that news of the evening'shilarity would be spread about , come back to Mr. Redbank , who had it much to heart that Fenton Parre make a good start as head of his family . This was the start he had made ! The great thick-headed fellow they called Cluff the Bear was preparing to dance a strange dance in the middle of the floor . He said it was the bear dance , and he had learned it among the Hassanomiscoes . Supposedly it was for young Jan Royalle that he danced this dance . Jan , throughout the evening , had displayed both the most delicate manners and the greatest curiosity about the way things were done in this new world . What he had drunk ( flips and rum , cider , sack-posset , and brandy ) had no effect upon him except , as Jazan noticed , a certain glassy look to his eyes . Two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cried out in rhythm , " Hey-ho , who , who , who . " And the others caught the rhythm and joined in . This was too much for Hagar . A heathen dance on top of all that had gone before ! She cleared her throat , stood up dramatically , admonished Fenton , and begged the others to desist . Mercuricus English sprang at the pretty , stiff , little girl , picked her up in his strong smith 's arms , whirled her about , and satp255her in Tom Pigge 's lap . She left so quickly everyone laughed . Jazan was glad she was now sitting beside Jan . She felt safe with him , drunk or sober . Cluff danced on . He had put bearskin mittens on his hands . His body grew looser and looser . Even his face changed at last , so it seemed as though it was a bear dancing before them . The floor responded to his feet . The " hey-ho , who , who , who , " the clapping , the swaying of the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arm about her . She hardly knew how this had happened . Hagar struck a commanding attitude and , making Abraham stand beside her , begged in God 's name that this paganry cease . The Bear dropped to all fours ; rushed at her , upsetting her ; gambolled about , catching at the women 's ankles . Phoebe was in her element . Bathsheba shuddered . Jazan was glad of the protection that the strange arm about her promised . She was half afraid of the drunken Bear and sorry for Hagar , thus up-ended  --  her poor , rickety little legs that she was always so modest about  --  displayed to all . Fenton had been quiet and dignified since the bear dance began , so his sister knew he was shamefully drunk . She was hurt that he could so abuse his last night at home . Gervase too was remote and silent , but he was cold sober . Their eyes met . And she knew that what she thought of the matter he thought also , and she hoped he did not like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject of bundling came up . All tried to explain at once to Jan Royalle this rustic custom , which he had not met in England . " You see , Royalle , in these New English houses of ours we rarely have but one warm room in the winter , and there we all sit  --  the one on top of the other , grandpa and grandma , mamma , papa , the servants , all the children , the cats and dogs.  | But this is not congenial to the mood of lovers , and the only other warm place in the house is bed . So we lay the lovers , fully dressed , in bed in one of the cold chambers . Thus they keep warm and get some privacy . " " And sometimes  --  by mistake  --  some children , Royalle . " " And it 's right good fun . . . . " " I like , " said the Bear with difficulty , " our New World customs . I like . . . " " And I as well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me how ' t is done . " Little Mercuricus , pointing at Hagar and Abraham , said , " At least we have here some lovers . " It seemed a proper punishment for the churlish pair . Fentonseized on Abraham , who fought and kicked in a most ungallant manner . Him they trussed to a broom . Hagar was struggling against the wiry strength of Mercuricus . The reluctantlovers were carried across the cold entry-way into the great chamber that , since Mr. Parre 's death , Bathsheba had demanded for herself . In the hall Tom Pigge was asleep in a corner , his fiddle beside him , his snores coming loudly . Then Jazan wished that Goody Goad had not gone for the night to Founder 's . She felt something should be done but she had no idea what . Bathshebastill sat in her chair , but her hands were now over her face and sobs shook her long body . Jazan felt Jan 's arm tighten about her . As he whispered to her , his lips touched her hair . He wanted her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bundling . Now Dick Blue and Captain Wolcott and that Denningboy ( who lived over by the Sheep Walks and whom Fentonliked and she did not ) came back into the hall . They were demanding that Royalle come with them.  | " We 've got ' em in bed , Royalle , but we ca n't hold them forever . " Jan pressed Jazan 's hand lightly and left her . For a moment she was alone in the hall with the weeping Bathsheba and the snoring Pigge . She heard the shouts from the great chamber , and Hagar 's flying voice . Gervase came in from the kitchen , crossed to her , and sat on a stool beside her . " Is there any way of stopping this , Gervase ? " " None that I see . But after this you women must go to bed . The men are showing off before you and that Jan Royallewhoeverhe is . " She lowered her voice . " It 's because Fenton can not stand the thought of Bathsheba that he acts so badly . Will he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ? " Gervase shook his head . " In ten more minutes I promise you they will all be ready for their beds . " A roar  --  half a protest , half a laugh  --  came from Phoebe , who had gone with the men . Instantly it was as though Jazan could see his ears prick like a listening terrier . " I 'd better go in . It 's well to have one sober head in the crowd . Not but what I think Hagar and Abraham got what they deserved in this rough handling . " Jazan froze . " Very well , I 'll stay here . " " No . Go to bed , my poor tired child . You were never meant for such rowdyism . And make Bathsheba go with you . I 'll look out for the rest . " Jazan went to Bathsheba and tried to stop her tears . " Oh , Jazan , I 'm so afraid . . . he 's going to England . And when he comes back . . . " Jazan tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful her dancing was . Bathsheba would not be turned . She would n't go to bed . All those lackeys were in her bedroom.  | At last , in despair , Jazan offered her a share of her own and Hagar 's bed , and so she led Bathsheba away . It was past midnight . They flung off some of their clothing and lay down together , but not to sleep . GERVASE kept his word and did what he might to quiet the matter down and get the whole household to bed . It was icy cold in the great chamber , and the candle that had been brought in was now out . For Mr. Parre 's sake , he resented the indignityto Hagar . And she was so young , only fifteen . He also had his concerns for Phoebe . He did not want her hauled about by these men , who were like to misunderstand her good nature . The Bear was so drunk he thought it was himself who was being bundled . Nobody had told him to take off his fur mittens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As soon as the blankets had been turned down he had grabbed Phoebe and she had grabbed Mercuricus , and so five or six were rolling in the vast bed together . In the confusion , Hagar broke loose and they lost her . Then the canopy came down . " Fenton , we 've lost Hagar . Will Phoebe do just as well ? " " Not for Abraham . " " Then cast out Abraham ! " And broom and all , they flung him in a corner . The bed cords creaked , ready to burst . " The question is , Who will suit Phoebe best ? " " She says she is going to marry my new steward . Now where is the fellow ? " " But Pm the better man , " swore Cluff , and again with his fur mittens he seized upon the plump young woman . She screamed out to Gervase . The dark strength of the men'sp259bodies , the coarse hilarity , Cluff 's hot breath upon her throat , frightened her . But even as she feared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any man is to be bundled with Phoebe , it should by rights be me . " All except Cluff agreed , and in no time they had him out . The lovers were felicitated , and the men lumbered across the hall . But now all were ready for bed , and the soberest began to lay out mattresses and bedding . It had been expediency only that had made the young stewardconsent to being bundled with Phoebe Bemis . He saw that the men might do much worse than this . If this satisfied them , he was ready to do his part . At first he had little thought of the woman , lying there beside him . She turned and the bed cords creaked . " Gervase ? " " Yes , Phoebe ? " " Gervase , I want to ask you and have you tell me the truth . Are you going to marry me ? " " No , Phoebe  --  you know that . " " Is it because I ai n't fine enough for you ? " He paused . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wicked shame for women who ca n't marry men to stand in their way to marrying women who can marry them . I think Mr. Parre was a wicked man to bring you up almost like a son of the house and spoil you for everybody else . " " I wo n't hear such against Mr. Parre , " he said . It was really that he did not want her approaching any closer to Jazan . " You love her  --  do n't you ? " " Perhaps . " " And you do n't love me . You have n't ever loved me . " " I have my own feelings , and they do n't seem much like anybody else 's . I do n't know that I love ' as you call it , any-one . " This seemed to reassure her . He had not heard her move , but she was much closer to him . " Would you kiss me now ? " she breathed . He felt a sudden resentment against the whole world . A moment of despair , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to him ? He turned to Phoebe , and his arms went about her . She might be common , but she was indeed a lovable wench . And she loved him . He had known this for months . All her ridiculous talk had not hidden the fact from him . With a slight catch in his breath , he buried his face in her throat . He felt the soft , yielding curves of her body . He did not care what happened to her nor to himself . When he was with Phoebe past and future lost meaning . Only the presentmoment existed . Years of repression melted away , as he felt that soft , warm mouth against his own . What , after all , might Jazan ever be to him ? And this was real , this loving woman 's body pressed against his . As he held her , he knew one thing . He had a need for Phoebe . A sepulchral voice broke in upon them from a dark corner . " In the name of God , get up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no idea that Abraham , trussed to the broom , was still lying in the cold corner where he had been tossed . " What ! Are you there , Abraham ? " " Indeed I am , Gervase , and the floor is icy cold . Ca n't you get up and let me loose ? Or are you too busy bussing your moppet ? "  |p261NOW  that Boston house which for years had beena haven became a torture to young Fearing . Forin November Peter Fearing had died in his pulpit . He had finished his sermon . He had bowed to the parting benediction . But that bald dome had never lifted from the Bible on which it had sunk . The corpulent , discarded body was laid away in the Copps Hill tomb . His soul was in Heaven . Forethought Fearing was alone . No intimate had he among servants or neighbours . Not one fellow-clergyman to whom he might speak of his troubles . No dog to welcome him home or cat to purr beside his hearth . He was alone and in doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miserable affair of the Parre branding . Then for the first time he questionedhis father 's easy positive faith and had yearned for Christ 's own words . But could a way of life be built up on the four gospels only ? Was " go and sin no more " all that should be said to an adulteress ? He himself was a rich man . Should he indeed give all to the poor ? Should a farmer ( for instance ) take no more heed of the morrow than a lily ? His father had not understood his worries but had answered him gently . As long as he had lived , the old man 's strength and love upheld his son . The skin of Forethought 's face , so fine-grained as to be almost poreless , took on the waxen look of such skins in ill health . A muscle high up under his left eye had begun a troublesome twitching . This little malady embarrassed him . Even when alone he would hide the spot with his fingers . If only he might sleep ! Dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , if I might weep ! For the loss of his father hadp262shocked him so deeply tears had been impossible for him . He guessed his present weakness had been noticed , for the chief ministry of his father 's church had not been offered him . And why should it be ? He had told the elders honestly that he wished for a little to " lie fallow . " That he could not preach until he had come to a conclusion within himself . The greybeardslistened to him with suspicion and sympathy , watching ( it seemed to him ) the dimple come and go high up under his left eye . He was young , they said , and the young often are . . . unstable . In time he might indeed equal his great father but now . . . His ears caught the one word " unstable " and he winced . But although he could understand why it was they wished him to stay on as " teacher " only ( some eminent divine being set above him ) he was humiliated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even a somewhat torn and damaged Fearing better than any other man ? He did not wish to be set aside . Part of him wished power and glory . Restlessly he would pace his house or sit brooding for hours , his head bowed , his fingers covering the twitching muscle . Even he knew that this brooding was not thinking . All winter he had toyed with the thought of leaving Boston , going to Canaan . Mr. Redbank had written him when his father died , and a correspondence had followed . Forethought had poured out his very soul to the paralyzed old man whom he had known only by sight . Mr. Redbank 's body was all but destroyed . Some said his mind as well . Only his soul remained ; and Forethought clung to this soul , so full of Christ 's own spirit was it . " Love God " and " Love your neighbour . " " That is all , " wrote the old man , " there is in theology . " Mr. Redbank had begged him to live with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all pastoral duties but the preachingonly . This he thought himself still able to do . At first thep263proud young man was amazed at his simplicity . He , famous son of famous father , most eloquent of pulpit orators , he hide himself away in an inland village , accept so humble and silent a part ? But Christ himself had taught humility , and sometimes it seemed to him that Mr. Redbank was not just a country parson but some actual follower of Christ who lived on into the present day . So might Saint John have written from Patmos . Twice he had seized a pen and accepted Mr. Redbank 's offer . Twice torn up the letter . Should he stay on in Boston ? He believed that if even now he went to the Elders , told them that his miasms had gone from him and he was willing to follow his father 's ways , they would invite him to the headship of the great church . Or should he go out to Canaan to Mr. Redbank , to Christ ? The February day was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casement and looked across High Street at the Macey house and shop , shuttered and desolate , with only old Dido living on in the ell as care-taker . It was he and his father , so the Widow had said , who had driven her to leave Boston . Cruel , she had called them in her rage over Christopher Parre 's fate . No followers of Christ . He remembered how in boyhood he had loved to go to the Widow Macey 's . She always had had a sugar bun or a sassafras root for him . His mind was so disordered through sleeplessness and worry he had a painfulsense that any moment he might actually see a little boy in hanging sleeves , with long flaxen curls falling over his blue pinafore , steal from the Fearing mansion to the Widow Macey 's . The little ghost of his dead self . He had never been the boy to run and shout . . . . Instead of the silent , long-dead lad he feared to see three little scarlet capes scampered down the snowy street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he guessed they were two sisters and a tiny brother . The oldest girl swung over the Macey fence and ran to the kitchen ell . The other two stood pressed against the fence , eager to watch but ready to run . Anyone else in Boston would have known the naughty little things were taunting poor , half-blind old Dido , who it was said might be a witch . Forethought , remembering the sweets the Widow Macey had given him and how he had loved her for them , suddenly hungered for such love . He hurried to the kitchen , where an old serving-woman sat cleaning a fowl . " Sweets , " he cried . " Sir ? " She thought him distraught . The poor lamb had brooded so upon his father 's death . " Quick , I must have sweets . Are there no almonds in the house  --  no sugared ginger or sassafras ? " It was over a week since he had addressed one word to her and now this childish crying-out for sweets . Forethought seized a handful of sugared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The biggest red cape was throwing itself over the fence . " Run , " she cried , " she 's after us . " The little ones turned to run . There before them like the wrath of God stood the tall , black-clad clergyman . " Stop , " he commanded . Their fat and trembling legs failed them . The tiny one began to cry . Caught between a witch and God 's just anger . " Do n't hurt my little brother , " screamed the red cape from the top of the fence , the stone she had picked up to throw at old Dido still in her hand . " Do n't you dare touch him ! " Forethought spoke gently to the red , peaked hoods before him . He could not see the children'sfaces . " I 've sugared almonds for you . Come and get them . " Unlike his father he had always been successful in his handling of children . He spread the almonds on his palm as though offering an apple to a timid horse . " Hezekiah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wails of terrorp265went up from under the cowering hoods . He took a step forward . They shrank from him . Then something inside his head broke . He never knew what happened , but he had taken his fist full of almonds and flung them at the children 's heads . He , who had always been gentle in his ways , burst into a paroxysmof futile rage . His voice broke , and the stone in the older girl 's hand struck his shin . His face was convulsed , and he feared he might weep . Yet why a man should weep because of the discourtesy of children he did not know . Blindly , still hatless and capeless , although the day was chill , he flung himself down High Street , letting his feet lead him where they would . So he had come to this . . . come to this . . . and what lay ahead for him ? He did not notice the curious stares that followed him . Nor did he know that the words he formed in his heart were also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried him to North Boston . Upon a headland looking boldly out to sea was his father 's tomb . He flung himself on the snowy ground before it . Then tears came . The first since his father 's death . In a torrent of words he prayed half to God and half to the corpse within . In time tears and words both ceased . He felt a relief such as he had not known for months . The problem which had been torturing him was settled . He would go out to Canaan , for in Boston the very children threw stones at him . To Canaan and to Mr. Redbank . He must go his own way . Christ 's way . He stood up and stared over the broad mouth of the Charles , filled with broken ice , and beyond were the low hills of Cambridge . A grey sky and a grey earth but between them the whole sunset ( full of enough colour to have filled the sky ) was pressed into a narrow band . He had never seen so livingp266a red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned to the west , and to the west lay Canaan . He would go home now , write his letter ( and this time he knew it would be sent ) . He would go to his bed and sleep for hours . Even as he stood beside the tomb he felt sleep welling up through him , numbing his limbs , relaxing his senses . He turned to go . He stopped a moment , head thrown back as though listening . What was that dream he once had had ? He could not remember it . . . but thus he had come weeping to his father 's tomb . And a little brown spaniel with yellow eyes had followed him . With resolute steps he swung off down Broad Street . FROM the waist down Mr. Redbank was a man of stone . He sat night and day in a donkey cart . The door of the parsonage had been widened so that the little beast could draw the cart in and out . A runway had been built over the meeting-house steps , and thus from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Mr. Redbank still preached to his flock . But it was true , as he told his young assistant , he could do little except preach . All other duties must be taken over by Forethought . " I believe , " he said in the difficult accent resulting from his third shock , " love must be the basis of all church discipline . " Forethought eagerly agreed . His face had lost the harassed look of winter . He had slept well since the momentous decision had been made . The twitching under his eye was gone . " It is not enough to force good conduct upon people . They must wish it for themselves . " And Mr. Redbank went on to tell what his assistant 's first duty was to be.  |p267Seems  in December a young woman and a young man ( servantsboth ) had been bundled together with the consent of their master . Nor , he feared , had matters stopped with that . Goodwife Goad had told him they had since then courted in byre and field and in the young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused honourable marriage . Forethought 's delicate gorge rose . He had imagined himself in Canaan as praying for the dying , comforting the bereft  --  not prying into the loutishness of two louts . Yet such was to be his first pastoral duty ! " You wish me to speak to them privately ? " " Yes , you must find out the truth . The Goody is so heartsetupon their marriage I can not entirely take her word . " " Can not their master direct them ? " " Their master is abroad from here nor will he be back until fall . His lady is in no position to correct the incontinence of others . I did try to talk to the eldest sister at home , but she 's a young miss bare eighteen . I saw my words hurt her . I hope the young lady can be kept out of this matter . " " I will never force such uncleanness upon a young maid , sir . " Forethought stopped abruptly . His translucent skin flushed . " It can not be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parre is the absent master and surely his wife is in no position to correct others ! And the young lady . . . she is . . . I suppose . . . " " Jazan Parre . " Forethought went to the bucket by the door , dipped up a gourdful of water , and drank slowly . " Yes , sir ? " " She had told me that while a child she sat under you for instruction . " " She did . "  | " And I believe some intimacy sprang up ? At least so I gatheredfrom her words  --  but her words are always few . " Forethought 's eyes shone . She had not forgotten . " Of the strangest sort . Hardly of the mind . Hardly of this world . But again and again she has come to me in dreams . " He sat in the chair beside the cart . " Did she not tell you of the last meeting we had ? Oh , sir ! I remember I wrote you at length of that miserable day I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mob gathered for the branding . Well , when it was done and I had failed , it was she whom I met . She believed in me . " The old man smiled . " From your letter I gathered it was some vision you met on Blackstone 's Point . Not one of the ladies of Paradise . " " So it was , and it was she . " " Of this she never has spoken . " " Nor have I  --  ever  --  until this moment . " So he guessed that to her as well as to himself the meeting had meant much . Mr. Redbank was silent . " Why not ? " he thought . " They are of equal birth and wealth . Young Fearing is the loneliest man I ever knew . It is a wife he needs . " In words he said , " It would be the greatest kindness if you could straighten out this matter of her servants for her . " Forethought was on his feet . " I will go this moment , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something-or-other and Gervase Blue . It is to him you must talk . I have told the chief female servant at Paradise ( the one who is so set on pushing this matter through ) that you will soon come . Go now and stay for supper . Ask for a servant to light you home . She will know whom to send . "  |p269SO  these were the gates of Paradise ! Forethought stood looking down the driveway past the thatched barns . There black , bleak , and peaked was Paradise itself . He felt the contempt of its backside turned thus to him and to the village , and its little windows seemed to leer at him askance . The earth of April , which to a farmer 's eye was full of promise , seemed dead and sodden to him . Boldly he stepped within the gate , but his way was protestedby such a roaring of dogs as he had never heard before . Four in all . Three of them the largest he had ever seen . If it had not been for their collars he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood up on their shoulders . Yellow eyes gleamed with hate . He stopped in confusion and some fear . They held him at bay . . . even at the gates of Paradise . " Sheepshead , be damned to you ! Gertrude  --  you old bitch ! Gone-away ! Valiant ! " A young fellow , with tawny hair , quick tight body , and ringingvoice had leaped from somewhere into the midst of the dogs and threatened them with his stick . The animals turned over the responsibility of the matter to him . One made a contemptuousgesture with its hind legs . The grey bitch growled and stalked off . Forethought wished to thank his rescuer but ( lid not know how to address him . He had on a white smockfrockand muddy leathern leggings , and the stick he held was obviously an ox goad . His manner as he swung around did not seem that of a farm servant . The eyes were wide set , clean , and blue , the face brown and ruddy ; but it was the air of selfconfidencethat made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom he never had heard.  | " The dogs always stop strangers just inside the gate . But if you stand still there 's no danger . ' T is their nature to hunt wolves , not clergymen . " And Forethought believed that this bold fellow thought it beneath the dignity of such fine dogs to hunt clergymen . " They 'll learn to know you in time . " So the arrogant young man knew at least that Fearing was no transient . He must know who he was . Why did he not call him courteously by name ? He was indifferently scratching the back of the smallest dog with his goad . Forethought noted the broad , heavy hands . Workman 's hands that did not go with the grace of the body or the distinction of the head . Those hands . And it came back to him . That boy whom he had found beating Will Sisley . . . yes , this was he ! The name  --  Gervase Blue . It had sounded familiar when Mr. Redbank had spoken it . Gervase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You are called Gervase Blue ? " The young man looked up from his dog scratching . " I am . And you , sir , are Mr. Fearing . " He looked at him a little defiantly as though he had guessed what was behind this visit . " I have come to call upon your household . " " There 's few of us here . The men are in the fields . Most of the women have gone to a quilting , but some of our ladies are about . " " Will you then announce me to your ladies ? " Gervase cast a glance at his patient oxen . " Nay . The dogs announced you . Yonder flags lead to the kitchen door . Go in and call them . I 've mended my yoke and must be back to my men , sir . " " My " men ! Why , the fellow could n't be over twenty . And were dogs the only servants to announce a guest 's coming ? Forethought bitterly disliked his welcome at Paradise . Herep271was wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart of the poor . Still afraid that the dogs might be back at him he picked his way along the path . Three geese with outstretched necks hissed at him . A dappled stallion nickeredfrom the barn-yard . The kitchen door was open , and he stepped within . The paraphernalia of a farm great enough to feed its own and send pack-horse after pack-horse to Boston with the surplushe hardly saw . Seated at the far end of the vast , dark kitchen sat a young girl bent over a book . He saw that she had a finger pressed in either ear . Her head was half covered with a head-cloth . So he stood and watched her . With a little sigh her fingers came out of her ears and her head bent forward . " Jazan , " he said in the lowest voice . She was on her feet , one hand going to her heart in a pretty modest gesture . He saw to his bewilderment that she was a stranger and golden-haired as an angel . " Oh , sir . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was there no one about to announce you ? " He was sure she had not heard him murmur her sister 's name . " Gervase Blue , " he said casually and smiled a little . " But he said the dogs do the announcing here . " " Indeed they do not ! Not for folks like you . What churls we must seem ! I heard the hubbub , but I was so deep in Amos . I only tried to shut the noise out . Come , we will go into the hall . " He saw that she was younger than Jazan and he knew the world would deem her prettier , for she was pink and white as a rose and her hair not severe , straight , and black but a mass of golden curls . As she moved before him to the hall he first thought her lame . She jerked as she walked , and he remembered how fast , silent , and light were the feet of her sister . Hagar motioned him to take the great-chair by the hearth embers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Parre 's sword was still hung with black . He noted the fair map of New England upon the wall , the dull white and brown and red of the room . Paradise . Here it was both Captain Parre and Christopher had been shaped . Here was the place Bathshebabore her fearsome brand . " I have always , " the young lady began , " admired your father more than anyone else . And to think you have come to Canaan ! Oh , sir , we need you badly . Such a sty as we have become . Can you believe it  --  the last three Sabbaths Mr. Redbankhas preached only of love ! We need your preaching . " " But , Mistress , I am not engaged to preach . My capacity is a humble , silent one . " " But some time when you hear what is given us for sermons your Fearing blood will rise in you . You will not be able to rest quiet . Then you will speak out . " He could not tell her that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You have no idea how much sinning and loose living there is about Canaan . " She dropped her voice . " Even in Paradise . We look to you , sir , for the right words . " " It is hard , " he began gently , " always and always to know the right thing to say . " " Oh , no , " she contradicted him shortly . He was amazed and a little amused . She had a sharp manner that might stimulate and might irritate . " God sets aside such men as you to be his instruments , knowing good and evil from birth . To refuse to act as God 's ambassador here upon earth would be the highestp273treason . And yet , " she said , " we are all of us  --  even you , sir  --  but human . To falter is human . . . . " It was as though his own father spoke to him . He looked at the tender little thing with wonder and growing respect . So they talked together until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in from the fields . Mistress Fenton Parre . She greeted the man who more than any other was responsible for her mutilated forehead with exclamationsof delight . No shame did she show that they had met before ! By her manner she took the honour of the visit upon herself . Branded she might be , but she was obviously mistress of Paradise ! That stout old woman , nodding at him , whispering that she knew why he was come , promising to " arrange things . " This must be the Goodwife Goad . A plump and hearty wench , introduced to him as Phoebe . She flushed under her thick hide as she curtsied to him . Anotheryoung woman , just over from Scotland , as bonny as a blue bell , her accent as rough as a thistle . Gervase Blue ( once more ) . Him they called " steward . " He presented his farm servantsto the new clergyman with as much courtesy and pride as though he were a court chamberlain and these young knights . The Penny Brothers , narrow-hipped and narrow-eyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could possibly be thirty . Jack Truly  --  sluggish and soft-eyed as an ox . And last of all little Billy Bright . This orphaned child was seven only . Obviously he was the darling of both men and women . Because Billy did not seem woe-begone and timid like most child servants , Mr. Fearing thought him forward . His face was as bright as a fox cub 's . His flaxen hair was not cropped to the skull as symbol of his servitude but cut squarely on shoulders and brow like a little gentleman's.  |p274Mr  . Fearing 's head was confused with so many new faces and names  --  and except for the Goads how young they all were , and free and untrammelled in their carriage and words . And then Bathsheba was saying , " My sister , Mistress Jazan Parre . " He had not heard her enter the room , but now she stood before him . " Truly , " she said , " we have met before , " and held out her hand to him . " Often and often , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetings than those of the flesh . He was slightly uncomfortable . Her eyes had always disconcerted him . Bathshebawas bidding him share the head of the board with herself ; Hagar asking him to bless their meat . So at last they sat down to rabbits stewed with onions and carrots , golden corn-meal mush , and limitless ale and hard cider . It was a vast , restless family of fifteen or more such as he had never seen in Boston . SUPPER was over . The table-board had been cleared and taken away . Then Hagar told the servants to fetch their work into the hall . Mr. Fearing , she promised , would read to them as in old times her father had . The steward , however , already had his hat upon his head . " No , no , Gervase , " the little mistress commanded him . " There 's an agent from Boston at Orde 's tonight , " said Gervase . " I must see him about our surplus wool . " Obviously he had not the least intention of obeying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch him now or lose him . " Mistress Hagar , " he said , " I will come again and with pleasure , and read you a whole evening if you wish , but tonight you mustp275excuse me . Mr. Redbank expects me back . " Goody Goad folded the stockings she was knitting and thrust the needles through them with vicious finality . " Gervase . " Evidently hers was the voice of final authority at Paradise . " Yes ? " " Is your lantern lit ? " " I need no lantern to get to Orde 's . " " But you can light the minister to the parsonage on your way . The night is thick as a blanket with fog . " He was silent . Forethought was gratified to see his arrogance gone . He looked a little shamefaced and belligerent , like a bad child . " Phoebe , get Gervase a lantern from the back entry . " " Yes , ma'am . " She was long in getting her lantern and anyonecould see she had been crying . Forethought 's confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why , they were nothing but bad children ! It would be easy to deal with them . He made his graceful adieux , promising to come to them often , thanking them for his reception . Then , at the last , he turned to Jazan , who had been silent throughout supper while her sister and sister-in-law had contended for his attention . He saw she had a black cloak on over her white dress . Iler delicate head was also black and white . He smiled and lout out his hand . " I must call you Mistress Parre now-a-days , " he said , and wished he had his father 's ability to compliment ladies . He wanted to tell her how beautiful to him was her black and whiteness , broken only by the red of the mouth . " But I will always think of you as Jazan . " " Call me as you think , but do not say good night . I am lighting you to the parsonage . "  | " There 's no need , " said Gervase , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But . . . " Forethought stopped in confusion . " Jazan , put down that lantern . Take off that cloak , " snapped the Goodwife . " If I wish to light a guest I may , " said the young girl . " And so may I , " said Gervase , and tried to take the lantern from her hand . " Do you think I am afraid , " he murmured fiercely under his breath . She would not give up the lantern . Forethought saw with horror the rough hand of the ploughmanclenched upon the young lady 's wrist . Their eyes met in stormy , intimate anger . He cried out , pained by the struggle . " Surely , if the young lady wishes . . . . " " I do , " said Jazan blandly , and the two set out together . It was well into April . The Goose Common and the houses about it were obliterated by fog . Moon , stars , trees , the habitationsof man  --  all were gone . Without form and void @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Creation . The smell of it . The sticky buds . Rank-growing grass beneath the feet . From all about and everywhere came the eerie crying of the first tiny frogs . The muffled hiss of geese as they passed Preserved English 's smithy . The suck of the mud upon their shoes . A dog barked from Orde 's . The eye could make out nothing except the splash of gold light from the lantern , but to nostrils and ears the night was full of meaning . Forethought took a deep breath of the earthy air . " Of course , " said a voice beside him , " I know why both Goody and you wished Gervase to light you . It is an old trick of Mr. Redbank 's . And there 's no reason , " she said bitterly . " Then you know of this matter ? " " Yes . " But she said no more . Never in Boston had he been lighted home by a lady of the house . Her courtesy slightlyp277embarrassed him . Why had she ? She could not thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be because she desiredthis intimacy ? Her arm brushed against his in the dark . He laughed abruptly , although there was nothing to laugh at . " I could hardly call you anything but Jazan now , " he said , " for the Mistress Parre I actually saw in the lighted hall is gone . The night has left us nothing but our inner selves . " Hurriedly she was saying good night at the parsonage door . He stood a moment before entering , gazing after the lantern light receding from him through the fog . There was a pathos in its littleness on so black a night . We are all , he thought , as lanterns  --  and soon out . TO whatever household came sickness or sorrow Mr. Fearing also came . He showed by his actions how Christ had humbled himself to the humble , and he said little . For the first time in his life he was loved more than feared . It was to Mr. Redbankhis soul now clung as formerly it had to his father . On the night of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was needed at Paradise . Old Goodman Goad had again fallen and broken his hip . In spite of his promises , Forethought had been but little to the great house . When he thought of Jazan she was always the starry-eyed , innocent child who ( in a dream it is true ) had first led him away from his father 's faith and into the presence of Christ . But when with her he was disturbed . He faced the fact that he felt towards her much as men of commoner clay feel towards women . From youth up he had secretly vowed himself to celibacy . Christ himself had neither wife nor lover , so why should he ? Hagar also disturbed him . Her talk was always of his father and the greatness of his Fearing blood . He could not tell her , could tell no one but the old pastor , that upon his father had he turned his back . Nor could he tell even the pastor that sometimes in shutting out his father he felt he had shut God out as well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden haze . One floated in them but one 's feet never touched the ground . Often he was homesick for the old days  --  so stern , so black and white , so sure . The messenger , Gervase Blue , was a soaked and rakish figurestanding in the Redbank kitchen , an old sack pulled over his head like a hood . For if your skin-drenched man does not look pathetic he looks rakish . " We might wait a little , sir , " he said . " I doubt if the Goodmangets back his senses in this world . ' T is a frightful night to take any man into unless he be as used to foul weather as myself . " Forethought said he was ready to go and did not mention the agues , headaches , and chills that had been dogging him all day . Gervase jumped into the saddle and bid the clergyman mount behind him . Rue Redbank held up a lantern . It cast an infernal light over the servant 's cowled head , flashing on white teeth and eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of Rue 's ) pulled about him . " Please mount , sir , and mind his heels . " Gervase did not know there was any young man who could not spring to a horse 's back without stirrup or mounting-block . Forethought would not admit his incapacity , and now that the rain whipped his face he felt like to swoon with headache and nausea . " I think I 'll walk . " " But you can not walk ? " The young voice was stern . Fearingp279always irritated the servant , although he knew he had reason to be grateful to him . It was he who had told Goody Goad flatly that she was a meddlesome gossip , and the church would not take disciplinary steps and force marriage upon her two proteges . At last Gervase got off , tied up Tobey 's reins , and bade the horse go home by himself . He took Rue 's lantern . Soon , even as he expected , it went out . Fearing was forced to take Gervase'sarm , for although the servant seemed able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see three inches before him . The rain came down like a waterfall . " Peace be with this house , " Forethought said on entering the kitchen , where a pallet had been made for the old man . And the faces of the watchers relaxed and miraculously a sense of peace came . All guessed by the pinching of Farmer Goad 's nose and the coldness of his extremities that he must die . Yet men do not die of broken hips . Why it was he now must die no one wondered . He had been bound to a plank so that his senseless turningswould not pain him . There was nothing to do but watch and wait . When the brass-crowned clock upon the hall wall struck midnight , Goody Goad begged all to leave her , and she asked Jazan and Hagar to sleep that night in the great chamber with Bathsheba and give their room over to their weary guest . Forethought had slumped sidewise a little , his eyes were closed , his mouth pulled awry . He breathed with difficulty . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His eyes , bright and sunken , opened as he heard Jazan 's voice . " Ill ? " He repeated the word foolishly . Like a child he let her lead him to his chamber . He collapsed heavily on the edge Of the bed . She felt his shoulder . It was still damp from thep280storm . His forehead was clammy with sweat . Gently she knelt before him , unbuckled his shoes , drew off the fine flax stockings . She went to the kitchen hearth and got hot bricks to wrap in flannel and lay at his feet . On such a night as this she could not ask the Goodwife to nurse yet another invalid , and she believed herself as capable as any other woman of the household . She felt compassion and pity for him when at last he lay in her bed . His aching eyes were closed and turned away from the little light of the candle . He seemed a strange and lonely creature to her , and she guessed he had always been so and always would be . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit . Her heart went out to him . She tenderly stroked the pale hair from his forehead . As she did so she realized she had always wondered how those seemingly metallic curls would feel under her hand . Soft as the coat of a spaniel . Her heart quickened , and she drew back ashamed as though she had taken advantage of his present weakness to discover a secret . His eyes did not open but he said her name . " Yes , Forethought ? " She had never thought to call him thus . " My good angel , " he whispered ; and " Do not leave me , " he said . FORETHOUGHT FEARING lay sick to death of a congestionof the lungs . All the English corn was ruined , and the flax that year would not be worth the breaking . Ploughed lands were seamed with gullies . One storm had ruined Gervase 's first year of stewardship at Paradise . Of this and the Goodman 's death Forethought knew nothing . Goody Goad said that in such sickness the crisis would comep281upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventh . If not the seventh then the ninth . It came upon the seventh , in a great flood of fever , rusty spittle upon broken lips , a groaning with every breath . It was a fearsome sight to see the fair young man so suffocating in the .. - oils of his disease . There was nothing Jazan would not do to save his life , which now seemed part of her own . He talked wildly and much in Latin . Often he spoke of his " good angel . " Hagar was much impressed that God had sent an angel to sit at his bed 's head . She took it as a sign that soon he would escape his tortured body . Jazan knew of whom he thought and was determined that he should live . At last the sickness turned , and every day he grew stronger . The tide of life ran fuller and fuller in him , and he gave himselfover to his convalescence with a sensuous pleasure . Never had he eaten such food as was served at Paradise . Never had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never had skies been so blue as the skies of that July nor bed so soft and deep to sleep upon . Even the water from the well sparkled with new life . The cocks that crowed in each new day had a different music to them from any he had heard before . Wonderful to be alive ! Only one thing troubled him in his happy , dreamlike state . Once before he had been sick to death and that was when he was thirteen only . He had eaten some poisonous thing ( no one ever knew what ) and had been terribly wasted . Then , even as now , convalescence had come with its beautiful promises . But at that time the rapture of returning life had not deepened his sense of taste and smell nor made him more aware of the curve of a woman 's mouth and throat , the delicate movements of her body . All his rapture had gone into a closer conviction of the presence of God . Why was it now when with a sigh of animal content he lay himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turkey had been that noon ( stuffed with early apples and onions ) and how rich the gravy ! And tomorrow the Goodwife had promised a suckling pig with an apple in its mouth ! And could it be he was more conscious of Jazan Parre than of God ? It frightened him to see in what direction he was moving . Often he wondered if he had not left God and his father behind him , not to find Christ ( as he had hoped ) but the delights of the body  --  the body that he had always looked upon as a stumbling-block for mortal man . Some time , if God did not help him , he would lose control of his poor , sinful body and take this woman in his arms , kiss and embrace her . She had a freedom of movement that at one moment seemed boyishlyunaware and the next deliberately wanton . When he tried to talk seriously to her about the lusts of the body ( hoping she was indeed his " good angel " ) , she laughed at him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suppose , she said , man was not born evil as the Puritans said , but innocent . . . . Supposethere was no such thing as " original sin " ? So he played with this thought which , when it came in later days to a stronger man , turned a world upside down . Often he sat beside her under Yellow Clay 's great oak . The golden summer days , the ancient tree , the fair , wide-eyed woman all reminded him of the Garden of Eden , those lonely , lovely days before God created evil and the knowledge of it . What shame had Adam and Eve of their bodies ? None until they fell . Life seemed simple and beautiful to him as though he and she were a new Adam and Eve and the rich river land of Paradise a new Eden . But when late in August he returned to the parsonage he was frightened of what lay ahead of him . His body hungeredp283for the woman and he was ashamed . He had moments of revulsionwhen Jazan Parre did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but woman , the ancient temptress , the seductress . He talked of this matter to Mr. Redbank , but the old man 's mind would often wander . There is but one thing in this world , he said , and that is love . He remembered how his father would often say the word " love " should be kept only for the feeling of a man for God . Lust was the proper word for his feelings for a woman . " ' T is better , " said the old man , " to marry than to burn . " Forethought lifted his head proudly . Long ago he had decided that he would do neither . Such mean choice was not for men like himself . Was he now at last to be betrayed by his body ? He had always felt that the dreams he had had of Jazan Parre she also dreamed , and this had been a bond between them . Now when he met her , thinking of his recent dreams , he flushed and turned away , fearing that she , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he could not sleep , he would feel her hand upon his hair like the hand of a witch-woman , and rising suddenly he would spend the night in prayer . One morning when , haggard and unrested , he went to the kitchen , there sat the old pastor in his donkey cart . " My son , " he said , " do not fight against the body  --  for God made that as well as the soul , " and he repeated the ugly lines about marriage being preferable to burning . At last Forethought broke down and wept and said that when Fenton Parre came back from England he would ask of him the hand of his sister . He spoke as a defeated man . " And Jazan , " said the old man , " what will she say to this ? " Forethought in his egoism had never thought much of this matter . From his Boston days he had always believed any woman who might would accept him . He had no doubt now.  |p284Forethought  remembered this conversation as the last one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man did not die , but his mind went out . His saintliness departed . Now he did not seem like Saint John himself but an old spider wrapped in shawls as in a web . He could hardly bear to have his " son " out of his sight for a moment . Over and over Forethought promised never to leave him until the end . Greedily Mr. Redbankaccepted this promise . But the young man was shocked that anyone could act so selfishly and at the same time prate so glibly about the Christian life . He nursed the old man tenderly , but his words about love seemed as simple and tedious to him as they had for over a year to many of his congregation . ONE September day , as Forethought Fearing stepped out of the meeting-house where he had gone to escape for a few moments Mr. Redbank 's demands , he saw a tall , broad-shouldered man standing bare-headed by the Parre burial-lot . Although at some distance he knew by the pose that it was Fenton Parre . He stole back into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canaan , the meeting-house had lately been enlarged once again . The south end , which was new , was built without windowsand of the heaviest oak logs  --  " but ' t is more like a fort than a house of God , " he had complained to the Selected Men . They told him that this was as Captain Parre had advised . The time might come , even after all these years of peace with the Indians , when a fort was necessary . They intended to fortify the entire building with equal care . Little light , he saw , would come in except the light of God . He found that against the advice of the absent Captain Parre he could make nop285headway , and had decided to wait until his return . Now Fentonwas back . Now was the time to talk to him . It was not of this problem he thought , but only of Jazan . He had told Mr. Redbank he wished to wed her . In his own heart he was not sure . Should he speak now or should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jazan had told him she was sure he would never live at Paradise as long as Bathsheba was there . " Sir , in your absence I have come to regard your sister , nor do I believe that she is indifferent to me . May I have your permission to ask her to marry me ? " Surely this was not hard to say . But his nature was like a democracy where everyone has a vote . Now it was seething like the Parliament in Charles I 's reign , a babble and confusion of many voices  --  not one voice speaking out as it did in Fenton , and the rest falling into line . Often Forethought was forced through these stormy sessions with the parliament of his mind . It was hard for him to settle matters when all this voting was going on within him . He often would turn to the outside world  --  at best a sign from God , at worst the merest freaks of chance . Into Thy hands , Father . . . he prayed . Then he was conscious that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the open door was Young Parre himself . Sensing his devotions ended , he walked forward to meet him . " I saw you from where I stood by my father 's grave . I wanted to make sure the stone I ordered from Boston had been fitly carved and set up . " And he offered his hand . " It is a handsome stone . " " I have just seen Mr. Redbank  --  what there is left of him . Is it true , as he tells me , you wish to marry with my sister , Jazan ? "  |p286The  moment had come . Forethought blanched . " Yes , this is true , I think . " Fenton sat down and motioned with his hat for the clergymanto join him . " I must beg of you not to continue with this idea . I have not forgotten the rancour both you and your father threw into that unfortunate affair of Bathsheba and my brother , although I believe , as Mr. Redbank tells me , you have changed since then  --  for the moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Why do you say for the moment ? " " I have never noticed men change much , no matter how hard they try . Once a Parre , always a Parre . Once a Fearing , always a Fearing . " There was a new-found courtliness in Fenton'smanner . " I am not asking you to give up this matter only because Fearings and Parres have never been friends , nor because I know you and I can never be as brothers , but because I am sure that you and Jazan will be unhappy together . I have always had her welfare at heart . " " How can you say that ? You did not think of her , did you , when you sullied her innocence by using her as your intermediarybetween yourself and that false woman whom you eventually married ? " " It did her no harm . She was old enough to know what the world was like . In fact , she knew already . " " Did you have her welfare to heart when you went abroad and left her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave permission to half the young men in Canaan to court her . " " I did n't think she would marry Mercuricus or Seth  --  and two is no half  --  but I thought it would keep her amused . " Forethought drew back in stiff disapproval.  | " One of the things I intended to do as soon as I got back was to see to her marrying . I think I have found the very man for her . Jan Royalle . They have already met , and she seemed to have some liking for him . He 's now in Boston and wishes to go into farming . He very much fancies my sister . He is well born and well-to-do . I should like having him here at Paradise . " At the thought of a rival , all doubt left Forethought 's mind . " I will not withdraw my suit for Jazan , except at your expresscommand . You can not , merely because you want a farmingbrother-in-law , go against our feelings . I think we have loved each other for years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you command me to give up all thought of her ? " Fenton did not answer immediately . He had a little the look of a man who is counting ten . " It would be very insulting if , without good reason , I peremptorilyturned down a man of your breeding , wealth , and position . And I will admit that if the two of you are bound to rush upon destruction , I will suffer my consent . My approvalI can not give . " " Thank you  --  for this much encouragement . " Fenton paid no heed to the sarcasm of the tone . " ' T is not encouragement . I will do all I can to turn my sister 's mind as well as yours . And is it true that you have promised to stay on at the parsonage as long as Mr. Redbanklives ? I will not consent that my Jazan be added to that muddled and crowded household . You must be content to wait , either for another change in the old gaffer or his death . " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . By my father 's will , Jazan and whomever she marries and whatever she may bear will have the right to dwell forever at Paradise . My father saw that she alone amongst his children had great love for her old home . That is one reason I should like a farming brother-in-law . How should you like to live at Paradise ? " " I would live . . . I would live in Hell to be with her . " Fenton laughed . " That 's just what it may be . How should you like living there ? " " I have tried it for over a month already . I think it is beau-tiful . " " Ay  --  with Tobey begetting his colts in the barn-yard and the hens getting into the kitchen to lay their eggs . " With a nod he was on his feet and was gone . Curious , that parting shot about Tobey . Forethought almost hated the creature . In his month at Paradise he had learned that Tobey 's service fees went to Fenton 's two sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she kept close track of his amours , for she wished to buy a copy of Peter Fearing 's sermons with her share . He felt a deep antipathy for the sturdy stallion . Tobey stood for everything he disliked at Paradise . FENTON seemed determined to make his stay at Paradise as short as might be . He had certain business to transact , and when this was done properly he would be gone back to Boston . During his stay in England he had pushed through several business matters for his brother-in-law , Jonathan Fayrweather . On his return a partnership was offered him . For many years he had sold furs through the Fayrweathers . He was already allied to them by marriage . He intended , if onlyp289he could manage his affairs at Paradise , to live the rest of his life in Boston . He seemed to have changed much in his nine months abroad . When Jazan remembered the careless rowdy he had been the last night he had spent at home , she almost regretted the change . Then he had had no heed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enjoy himself , to forget the misfortune of his marriage in sack-posset , flip , and good company . She saw that he had prepared a list for himself , and when one thing was done he checked it off , as though he was all prosperous merchant and no longer a wild Indian trader . The first morning he gave entirely to Gervase Blue , going over the estate inch by inch , commenting upon the new work undertaken by his twenty-year-old steward , and understanding the tragedy of the great rain storm in July which had washed out fields of grain and ruined all the flax . Gervase told him how he had indeed taken a gamble by putting so much land to the delicate flax . One night had ruined it all . Fenton said , " But if the rains had n't come just as they did , you would have made me a fortune . I believe a man should take a chance now and then . Try it again next year . " He had supper at Founder 's and looked with some amusementat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admire them much in spite of their mother 's praise . Christopher was still absorbed in his Indian dialects . At times he seemed to have forgotten he was a branded man . Yes , he was well pleased to have his land farmed as though it were still a part of Paradise . He would have liked to have been a farmer to please Salome ( Fenton noticed that he patted her tired hand ) , but that he could not be , and she understood . He was at home when Miller Blue came to him and asked if he would permit his Abraham to wait upon Hagar . Fentonp290said Abraham might " wait , " but there was to be no talk of marriage for three years yet . He reduced Goody Goad to tears by the magnificence of the gravestone he ordered for the Goodman 's grave . He gave Phoebe a lecture . Since her complete and rather public rebuff by Gervase , Phoebe had got more out of hand than ever . She still , in her own way , loved the steward and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Had not Goody Goad again and again said Gervase would come to see it was the thing to do ? She left Gervase severely alone , although she would sometimes sigh heavily when she set down his meat before him . Now she was unconsciously trying to arouse his jealousy by attracting the admiration of the other menservants  --  bachelorsand young every one . " You will find yourself a mother before you are a wife , if you do n't watch out , Phoebe , " her master told her . She was heart-broken at this rather undeserved reprimand and for weeks did only half her usual amount of work . If Jazan had read Fenton 's list , she would have seen that now only two items remained . Jazan . Fearing . Bath . He hardly seemed himself at all , but he did seem a powerful and considerate head of the house . Perhaps Mr. Redbank 's words at his father 's coffin were bearing fruit . At first she was surprised that he was in so dawdling a mood as to suggest to her to go fishing upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she guessed . It was now her turn , and he wished to be sure of privacy . She was almost afraid of this business-like , reserved Fenton who had come back from England . She understood the half-naked blackguard in Indian drawers better.  |p291He  found the Indians ' birch-bark canoe hidden in the hollow of a dead chestnut tree and carried it to the gravelly beach of Long Pond . A dozen strong strokes and they were out in the blaze of the September sun . Jazan waited for Fentonto speak . He caught two bass , a number of yellow perch , and then a gigantic pickerel . " I have , " he said , " a favour to ask of you . Tomorrow I ride away , and after I am gone I want you to talk with Bathsheba . " " What , then , Fenton ? " " I want you to tell her that she is no longer my wife . " " You married her , did n't you ? And when you might have repudiated her , you took her back . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason that she was already married when she married me . It was this way . In London I found her stepfather 's shop . He was frightened when he learned who I was . He told me as little as might be , but I did get from him the name of the Dorset squire  --  who , you remember , would not marry her just before she came over ? So I went to Dorset . " " What did you find ? " " He did not marry her because two days before the weddingher true husband made himself known to him . " " Are you sure ? " " Yes . " He drew papers from his pocket . " Here is the sealed and attested copy from the Parish Registry at Oxford . When she was seventeen she married a scholar , one Roger Bliss . You see ? Her name and his . She , set down as Bathsheba Holmes , spinster of St. Paul 's Churchyard . He , a bachelor senior sophist of Magdalen . He was poor and dissolute . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But this Bliss had sunk so low as to be working about the Mitre as a porter.  | I went to the Mitre . Everyone there remembered him . He had died but shortly before I got there . And it was the same man . I always knew Bathsheba had something to hide from me . And she never meant to take that boat back to England . Do you remember the taking she was in when she knew I was going to London ? She feared I would learn . And so I have . " " But what will happen to Bathsheba ? " " I will repudiate her . " " Turn her out of doors ? You can not ! I do not like her . . . I never have  --  but she has been in a terrible predicament and has borne it well . Now , this will kill her . Wo n't her stepfathertake her back ? " " He will not . " " And that brand upon her forehead ! Where would she go ? " " She can stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She is now indeed a widow . I want you to tell her to look about for some man , not too fine , who will marry her . I 'll pay a decent dowry . " " Do you forget how much you once cared for her ? " " I do not forget . Now I want you , as soon as I am away , to slip the idea into her head that I know the truth about her . . . and that I am planning soon to marry another . " " Oh , Fenton , who ? " " She is our Governor Bellingham 's grand-niece . She was travelling with an elderly aunt and uncle upon the same Sea Queen I came back upon . They were too sea-sick to mind her much . " For a moment he laid aside his fishing tackle and told a little of his " Star . " All her life had been spent with elderly people . Her parents were old when she was born , and soon dead . Then she had gone to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , she waited upon them ! Fixed papp293for grandpa , helped grandma in and out of her pony chaise , and never guessed there was another life . Star learned all about the life of the old ; rheumatism and red flannels and soft foods ; nothing about the life of young men and women . So she seemed like a nun from a cloister . . . . " Not at all , Jazan , " he said at last , looking at his sister , " what you would expect me to pick out for myself . She is so very young , reserved , and a little severe in her manner . " " How old is she ? " " Fifteen only . " " Nobody of fifteen ought to marry a man like you . Have you spoken to Mr. Bellingham about this  --  child ? " " She spoke  --  as soon as she saw him on the dock . I tell you , she is very determined . " " And I suppose she loves you with her whole heart ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one more gasping fish upon the forked stick and picked up his paddle . After Bathsheba , after the lascivious ladies of Charles II 's court , with their bare bosoms and rosy thighs , Estella Bellingham had taken him unawares . He smiled as he thought of the odd , demure child , with mouse-coloured bangs reaching to slender arched brows , serious eyes looking out from beneath . He guessed that she herself did not know whether her thighs were white or rosy . " I must be getting old , Jazan , to be so attracted by youth , innocence , and the virgin heart . " He knew that he was the first man ever to impinge upon this little " Star " Bellingham 's soul , and this fact he thought would bind her to him , and him to her . Towards the end of the long voyage he had tried to tell her a little of himself . Partly he told because he was honest ; partly because he thought his false marriage to Bathsheba might make trouble for them ; and partly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even . Such adoration and trust hardly seemed human . He told her of Bathsheba . She fixed her pale eyes upon his face , made a few intelligent comments , agreed that it was now his duty to dower the poor woman , offered some of her own great fortune for the purpose  --  and that was all . He told her of Johnny Pigge , and how at last this unfortunateyoung harlot had escaped the cruelty of the white men and had married an Indian ( although few among the whites knew this ) . She shook her head and sighed , as though saying to herself , " Young people will be young people . " Fentonmight as well , he thought , have told her of the strange mating habits of the elephant as of his own . He laid down the paddle and baited his hook . " I intend to deal fairly with this little Star , " he said , " and will be a proper merchant partner of Fayrweather and Parre . We will buy the old Macey house upon High Street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . She put her fingers about the windows and said , But there 's a draught . ' Half was it like having an ancient dame upon your hands , her mind is so set on those things important to the old . And fifteen only ! But she knows her mind and exactly what she wishes to have done . She may announce these decisions in the smallest voice , but they are decisions . I 'll never ride roughshod over her ! Nor do I so wish , but only to please her . Jazan , my days of Indians and trading are done . ' T is a life for a boy  --  not for a grown man . I 'm twenty-eight . And those months I spent in our King 's court did something to me . Something truly of the Puritan I seemed in that close and fetid atmosphere . They made much of me . I was so new a thing to them  --  almost as though I were a Tawny myself  --  and yet they knew my grand/father was a Kentish knight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with fine gold armour and three ladies  --  all but naked  --  to attend me , and the King 's mistress draped about me for Venus . " " Were they very beautiful , these court ladies ? " " Fair enough , but mincing and mawkish . Bathsheba copies their manner well . Everything , these days , must be gallantly done ; from the way a lady puts on her hat to the way she dismisses a lover . . . . La , sir  --  be gone . ' T is day ! ' " he mimicked . " And you came up out of that and met Star  --  as you call her ? " " Ay . I came up and there was Star . " JAZAN could not find the proper words of congratulation . She let him fish on in silence , which at last he broke . " But ' t was not alone court ladies I saw , nor merchants for Mr. Fayrweather . I was mostly about with military men . Governor Bellingham wishes me chief of the Boston forts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell him that ' t is not our seaports we should fortify against the French and the Dutch , but every frontier village against the Indians . " " I can not believe that they will ever rise up against us . " " I can not believe that they will not . Plymouth Colony is once more having trouble with that King Philip of theirs . " " But that is Plymouth , and far away . . . . " " If Philip and his Wampanoags rise up , will the Narragansettsjoin with him ? The Mohawks , the Tarratines , what 's left of the Pequots ? Our own Nipmucs ? " " They hate each other even more than they hate us. "  | " Yes , this is still true . But will it be true forever ? We have taken their hunting lands to plough . We kill off their game , and yet forbid them English arms . Of course they have them . With one hand we forbid them strong drink , and with the other we give it them . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , I see nothing for them but to become the farm servants and labourers authority wishes , move on to the west  --  yet the west is already settled with their enemies  --  or to fight it out with us , while yet there 's time . If I were they , I 'd fight it out ! Never would I stand by and watch the white men setting up always more stone walls , more churches and towns , and breeding our huge families . " With some enthusiasm , he drew up a campaign for the Tawnies . " If they could but work together and begin on the outskirts , they could exterminate us all . But they will not , Jazan . They 'll begin in Plymouth Colony . If only they had one sharp military mind among them ! " " They should have you for their general . " " If they did , they might win . But they have not . So I should prefer to be given a roving commission to go about the towns and prepare for Indian warfare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a very fair garrison . I 'll see the Selected Men about the other half 's being fortified before I go back . " " That reminds me . Mr. Fearing takes it hard that you have persuaded the Selected Men so to fortify our meeting-house . It is , as he says , primarily a house of God , and . . . " " Thank God you reminded me ! I 'd all but forgot the greatestmeat of this meeting . " " I 've heard enough , " said Jazan , " to hold my stomach for days to come . "  | " I gather you have gone your own way in my absence . " " What do you mean ? " " As soon as you mentioned Mr. Fearing 's name , I remembered that he has asked your hand of me . He spoke as though the matter was all but settled between you . " Jazan 's face was amazed . " I can not believe you . There has been no talk of our marrying . " " Love , only ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true we have some regard for each other , but  --  I suppose it is the memory of something he once said to me  --  I did not think it was marriage he had in mind . " " Well , so it is . " " Surely you are inventing this ? " " Not I. Mr. Redbank told me how for a month and more Fearing has but been waiting my return . So , seeing the fellow , I taxed him with it . " Jazan 's face was ashamed . " I wish you had not taxed him , no matter what he may have said to Mr. Redbank . I do not understand . . . . " Never had she thought of Forethought Fearing as a husband . She could not . " Oh , why did you blurt the matter out ? " " I wish to clear the woods a little for my own candidate . " " Your candidate ? " " Young Royalle . " " That girl-faced boy ? Never ! " " He 's no girl , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inch long . He 's a stout fellow . But I 'll never drive you . If you want Forethought Fearing , or anyone else of good position and barely sufficient birth , I will consent . " " What did you say to Mr. Fearing ? " she asked curiously . " Nothing much . I could not , without grave discourtesy , tell a man of his position that he was not permitted to court my sister . After all , Father gave permission to the riff-raff of Canaan . " ( Yes , he had changed . Seth , the Younger , Mercuricus English  --  they had not been " riff-raff " to him before he went abroad . ) " So I gave permission . He wanted my approval . That I could not give . " " But why not , Fenton ? " " I 'll never be able to like him . You forget how the Fearings , father and son , whipped up popular feeling against Bathshebaand Kit . But that was not the main point , as I told him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fearing , always a Fearing . And they do not mix . " " He hardly is a Fearing ' any more . I think it is Mr. Redbank'sinfluence upon him . He is no longer the man you used to know . All that has been supplanted by something else . . . something he never can get the words for  --  but ' t is the very spirit of Christ . " " Yes , I too heard him talking about Christ , and looking like a fool , at the time of the branding . And he will always be changing . And always change back to what he was . " " Do you think he is weak ? " " Yes  --  I think he is weak . If I were a woman , I would rather be married to a strong brute than to a weak saint . She 'd have a hard life with either but more fun with the brute . " Jazan was sitting upright in the canoe . Her eyes blazed . " I think he is the strongest man I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal strength  --  like yours and Tobey 's . " " Ha , there 's a fish for you . " And he pulled in and threw away a miserable little kiver . " I think he is weak and unstable . And I warn you now , Jazan , if you marry him , you will regretit . I will not command you  --  except this far : I do think you must marry someone  --  and soon . Nineteen is over-old top299be unwed , and you 've proved captious and hard to suit . What do you think women are made for ? And much pains were taken in your making , Jazan . " As far as she could remember this was the first compliment she had ever heard from her brother . There was a soft " hollo " from the gravel spit from which they had floated the canoe . It was Gervase Blue calling to him . The sad vowels of the call echoed against the shallow hills . Jazan bowed her head , as though it were a blow . Fenton paddled for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What news ? " " A man from Boston , rid out to see you . " " Jan Royalle ? I expected him . " " So it is . " Fenton grinned at Jazan , bade her follow him , and left his servant to put away the canoe . GERVASE carried the canoe , and Jazan followed with the paddle . She found this slight weight almost more than she could bear . Her bones did not seem put together with sinews but with water . Gervase fitted the canoe neatly into the heart of the dead chestnut . " I 'll go back for the fish , " he said , " and overtake you . " She doubted he 'd overtake her . For months now he had shown a blind instinct to avoid her in all ways . She sat herself on a dead limb fallen from the tree . She could smell lake water and hear it lapping among the reeds . She smelt mushrooms and leaf-mould and the ferns her feet crushed . She put her face in her hands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet stop before her , but she did not look up . " Will you sit for a moment ? " Now she knew what she must do  --  be it bold or maidenly , it did not matter . He sat himself as far apart from her as he might and still share the tree limb with her . It was as though he feared to find himself thus alone with her by the deserted lake side . " What is it  --  Mistress ? " " You did not use to call me Mistress . ' " " But so you are . And ' t is well we both remember . " She thought of him as she had first known him : the ragged child servant at the mill , and the dignity he had always had in spite of Goody Blue ; of how , always in longing , his eyes were fastened upon Paradise . Then he had come to work for her father , and they had been for a short time only as childrentogether . They had hunted eggs in the barns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , picked wild grapes , and read together in the long evenings . There had been no thought of servant and mistress until that fatal time they had overheard Agnes talking with her father . Then both realizedthere was a barrier between them . With the coming of the barrier , love came . But there could be no honourable expression for such love as theirs , and so  --  silent and hopeless  --  ithad pressed down , concentrating into a poison which had harmed them both . For Jazan had lost the easy trustfulnessand open-heartedness of her childhood . She had , in the last three years , become silent and a little remote . Gervase worked over-hard and kept himself too much from his fellows . Yet thrice every day these two sat together at tableboard . Their eyes would meet and drop again , and they rarely spoke . Yet it was the servant  --  not the mistress  --  who kept this decent decorum . Jazan , although she knew no marriage couldp301there be for them , resented the silence and self-control of the young servant . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in words what his eyes said . He would not , and now that at last he sat thus alone with her , she saw that he was afraid . She raised her eyes and spoke bluntly , " If I were a poor serving-maid , would you marry me ? " " Yes . " He tried to smile , but grimaced . " If you were a landed man ? " Why do you ask ? " If you were rich , and I poor ? " He nodded . He was miserable . " But as things are , you will not ? " " You mean , I can not . " " If you put love before pride , you could . " " It has been done before , " he said bitterly . " Servants have seduced their master 's sisters and marriage has been preferred to a bastard . Do you think , Jazan , I am that sort of faithless servant ? " " No , " she said . " I suppose that is why I love you . Honour will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . " " Then you are not as I am . Oh , Gervase , I love you so . . . . " She put out a hand to him , but he turned away . " Well , at least I have asked you , and you have answered me . There is never hope we might come by marriage honour-ably ? " " I have thought and thought . . . . In time , in years to come , it might be . . . . Jazan , could you wait for me ten years , or fifteen , say ? By then I might have made something of myself . Folk might forget that I have no name of my own , only the name of my first master . I have thought that if , perhaps , the Indians do rise up , there will be a chance for me . In times of war they say good men rise fast to the top . Then we might speak of this again . " " Ten years , " she cried , laughing wildly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no  --  by then I shall be married to another . " " But I will not , Jazan . I will live a lone man all my life , because I can not have you . " " And because I can not have you , I will marry Forethought Fearing ! " " Dear , do not be so foolish ! You are nineteen only  --  wait a little . " " But I must get free of you . Oh , you have been a load upon my heart  --  and I upon yours ! We have sat too long under a spell . If you will not break it , then I will . And I will be a good wife to Mr. Fearing . Half I think I am ready to love him already . I knew it first when he lay sick abed and my hand touched his hair . For I need love and I know it , so ready am I to love . But first I had to rid myself of you . " " And this talk between us . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A little , yes . You are so cautious , Gervase . I said I loved you because honour will always mean more to you than love . This is n't true . Almost it makes me hate you , for I have humbled myself to you . I feel like a child who jumps from a hayrick , never doubting but his father will catch him . So I jumped , Gervase  --  and you did not catch me . " And " Leave me now , " she said . " I 'll question and beg you no more . Never again . I go my way as best I may . And you  --  go you yours . Go away now , Gervase  --  back to Paradise . . . . " And she was sobbing , her face once more in her hands , her body rocking back and forth . So he went and left her.  | JAZAN at first refused to tell Bathsheba , but finally she consented . She hoped to handle the matter more delicately than Fenton had time or inclination . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found Bathsheba alone in her own chamber . She had a basin of water beside her and a comb , and before her a little looking-glass . She was trying in a listless way to arrange her curls . She squared her light jaw and turned her head away , as Jazan dropped down beside her upon the bed . " Fenton found out ? " Jazan nodded . " When did he tell you ? " " Yesterday afternoon , while we were fishing . " " I knew , " said Bathsheba calmly , wetting her silver comb in the red earthenware basin . " I knew as soon as he came into the kitchen that first day . Did you notice he did not call me wife , ' but Bathsheba ' only ? " The poor woman looked almost ugly , and her face had lines over it as though someone had drawn a thread over a ball of wax . The purple A stood out in all its horror . " Your first husband  --  that is , your husband  --  is dead . He died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fenton see him ? " " No . He died before he got to Oxford . " " I 'm glad of that . I could n't have borne to think Fenton saw him  --  as he became . Jazan , you must take my word for it , he was the handsomest lad when he married me . ' T was on a May Day , and folk said we looked like the King and Queen of May . But my father ( he was alive then ) took me away . I ) o you think Fenton will want to marry me now I am a widow ? "  | " I 'm sure he wo n't . " " But he seduced me ! " she cried passionately . " For what do you call it when a man lives with a woman for I do n't know how many years under the name of marriage ? " Jazan started to say she supposed it was called bigamy on the woman 's part , but she had a new sympathy for the lady and said nothing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can find a proper man for yourself he will see to your dowering . " " Why wo n't he marry me himself ? You are keeping somethingfrom me . " In a little time it came out . Fenton wanted to marry another . Jazan was amazed at the change that came over Bathsheba , who had borne up at the beginning with much dignity . She flew into a frenzy of rage , not at the faithless Fenton , but at the fifteen-year-old child she had never seen . Her face turned livid with hate . Her hands clenched . " I 'll kill her , " she choked . Cunning came into her eyes . She grasped her sister-in-law 's knees . " Goody Goad  --  she 'll give me some medicine . I 'll put a blight upon them . There are hundreds of ways old women have for cursing the marriage bed . And I 'll curse it for them . " " Goody is no witch . It takes a witch to do such things , and we have none such in Canaan . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing . If the Devil ever does come , I 'll sign his book fast enough . . . . " Her mind wheeled about . " And Christopher and Salome . . . I hate them both . Founder 's House is my house . Mr. Parre gave it to Fenton and me  --  what are they doing there ? It is my house . And those twin babies of Salome 's . . . they ought to be my babies . . . . Oh , Jazan , I have n't any child of my own . . . I have n't any child . Why has Salome two ? And Fenton . . . I suppose this minx of his is with child , now , by him . Everybody but me . . . . " She fell into such a frenzy Jazan feared she was mad and ran to fetch the Goodwife . And so Bathsheba slept no longer in the great chamber under the silken canopy that Mr. Parre had bought in Venice . Jazan slept there , and Hagar had the little chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jessie and Phoebe , but Jazan begged of Goody and she was given Fenton'sand Christopher 's old room . The boys ' discarded boots and books , bear traps and fishing tackle , still were about . And nailed upon the wall was a moth-eaten beaver skin that Fentonhad trapped as a boy and always kept because of the curious streak of white on one flank . Upon the floor was a wolf skin . There were arrow-heads Totonic 's father , ChickenChuck , had made of stag-horn for his neighbour 's sons . A strange room for a fastidious lady . She looked about her blindly , and never attempted to change it to suit her own temper . Now she was expected to work every day and all day long in the kitchen , the dairy , the still , or the loom room . At first Jazan objected to this . Bathsheba had always been so idle and fine . But the Goodwife told her the poor woman 's only chance for a happy life was to mend her lazy ways and become a neat housewife . Otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fenton could not be planning to give a large dowry . Bathsheba herself seemed at last ready to learn what the Goodwife had to teach her , but she was pathetically clumsy , always cutting herself with a knife or losing down-stream the clothes she attempted to wash in the river . Now there was no talk of her sitting at the head of the table . She sat below the salt , with Phoebe and Jessie . She walked last into the pew on Sabbath . She still held her head high but most of the time she was silent . When she talked it was impossible to stop her  --  especially if Mr. Fearing was present . To him she always wished to confess her sins . Her slightly contemptuous smile might seem to a casual eye unchanged , but it had grown vacant . She took little care to draw her curls over her forehead and was often untidy . Any spare time she might get from her labours ( and the Goodwife was not cruel to her ) , she wanderedoff into the woods . Partly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Goody Goad taught her the common wild herbs  --  St. John's-wort , nightshade , dittany , and rue  --  and the London lady could often be seen with an old whittle over her head , plodding through marshes and kine walks hunting for the medicinal herbs . JAZAN was so restless she felt unable to sit quietly to her work but paced back and forth through the house and out of doors , knitting viciously at a pair of stockings . She miscountedher stitches and did not rectify them . She dropped others and did not pick them up . Then Forethought presented himself  --  neat and gentlemanly in his habitual black silk . His air of decorous urbanity slightly irritated the girl . She herself was dressed as a country-woman : barefooted and barelegged . Her short linsey-woolsey petticoat was mealy coloured . Her bodice , which laced before and behind , was scarlet ; and the shift which showed at the throat and upon the arms was not of the sheerness suitable to her station , but coarse , greyish linen made from the third or fourth carding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , " she said , and her knitting needles clicked . Ever since Fenton had given his half-hearted assent to Mr. Fearing 's suit the gentleman had presented himself daily to his lady . It was only three o'clock . He was not late come . Early come if anything , he thought , for Mistress Parre had not found time to lay aside her working clothes and dress herself finely . She threw the knitting impatiently upon a form in the hall . Jessie , the smiling Scottish servant , was standing before the wool-wheel . Not once had Jazan and Fearing been alone since Fenton had said this man might speak for himself . Meeting always indoors , there had been no privacy  --  especially as Hagar and Bathsheba were both so avid for their clergyman 's instruction . Nor was there now . Both had the same thought . The girl brushed back her roughened dark hair and spoke rapidly . She wished him to walk with her to a swamp far out on Great Commons . She would show him a wild cat 's den , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then she turned upon him and laughed ruefully . " But surely not , sir , as now you are dressed . " It ended with Forethought 's changing into old clothes of Fenton 's . Almost blushing , he presented this new version of himself to his young lady 's approval . He had on reddish leather breeches and leggings , a faded blue shirt open at the throat , and neither waistcoat , jerkin , or coat to cover it . The coarse , manly clothing suited well with his height and goodly form and gave the finely turned head a new beauty . Jazan had never before seen him dressed as other young men dressed , and he seemed closer than a fastidious young clergyman in neat , costly black ever could . " But surely , Jazan , " he said , " you will need stockings andp308shoes ? The way may be muddy . Should you not put on clogs ? " Jazan laughed at him . Feet , she said , were easier to clean than shoes , and they cost naught and never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the mincing marmalet dames of Boston ! As she spoke he glanced at her feet and was surprisedthat anything so slim could look so strong . Together they crossed the river and went uphill into the Great Commons . There were cattle paths to follow . They pushed through blueberry and blackberry tangles which tore Jazan 's bare legs . And the sun above them warmed the fragranceof sweet fern and bayberries . Golden-rod and asters and the scarlet of the sumach bushes coloured the pasture with autumnal tones . After more than a mile the kine paths ended . Jazan turned to the right and downwards and led the wonderingman into a vast , still cedar swamp . Here it was always dark and dank , but at this time of year passable to knowing feet . Jazan 's hair caught on twigs and tumbled about her scarlet shoulders . Her milly petticoat was torn . Still she led the way , on and on with nimble feet and glowing eyes . At last they came to a dry knoll . It was here , she said , ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At that time cats had lived in yonder den  --  but not now . She flung herself upon the ground . All about them was the gloomy swamp , lumped with dried marsh grass , choked with the white skeletons of fallen trees , slithering with snakes . Never had Fearing seen so evil a spot . He flung himself besideher . Without a word they were in each other 's arms . Jazan had never imagined that this moment would come nor dreamed how it was his mouth would feel against hers nor that his scholarly arm would be so strong about her . Once she hadp309idly thought that kissing him would be much like taking an oath upon the Bible , as folk did in England . She found he was only as other men , knowing by animal instinct ( surely not by practice ) how to win the woman that he wished . Then , after a little , he gently brushed back the streaming hair from her candid , childlike forehead and asked her was he acceptable to her as a husband . She was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a little . He was not disappointed that she did not rise immediately to his bait . Still , that evening in his bedchamber at the parsonage , it seemed strange that although she could not say she was ready to marry him , she had shown no hesitation in accepting embraces , the memory of which made him go cold all over . He did not like to think how they had dallied upon the ground like a couple of courting rustics . The torn petticoat , which a few hours before had seemed bewitching , now slightly offended him . And how had his mouth , arms , hands , all known their part without direction from the brain ? He had not known that it was thus the bodies of men and women melt together . lie had heard of such things . Lust , it was called in sermons  --  what was it in life ? There seemed no connection between the young maid who had met him two years ago upon Blackstone 's Point  --  or the child , five years ago , who used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this lissom nymph of beast haunt and wildwood . Nor was she the quiet young gentlewoman who had nursed his sickness and had sat many hours beside him under Yellow Clay 's oak  --  stitching , spinning , weaving . He decided he would wait a three-day before he went again to Paradise . He was there next day . And gently Jazan sat beside a window in the hall . Rain lashed the tiny leaded panes . Her lids lay quietly over eyes that the day before had flashedp310at him . Here seemed a sober enough good woman to share life with a minister . But every now and then a fit of wildness would come over her , and would he or not , he must share it with her . He began to lose weight . The old nervous twitching came again under his left eye . Yet back he went to her , always once more . So September gave way to October , and then November . The days shortened and darkened . In November Fenton Parre was to marry Estella Bellingham . And the folk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CHRISTOPHER stood at the door of Founder 's and looked across the river . He saw the train of six horses that would carry the wedding-guests . He could hear his sons squalling as his wife fitted them into panniers hung across the front of her saddle . Once he heard Jazan 's laugh . She would go , and Hagar as well . And Goody Goad and Gervase Blue . But Bathsheba  --  shewould not go . Nor would he show his brand again to Boston . For ten days she would be at Paradise and he alone at Founder 's , with only the river to separate them . He went into his house . It was the first time , since his marriage two years ago , Salome had been away for a night . Going into the empty house he got a sense of adventure . It was as if he had never quite seen it before . He put away the twins ' double cradle . He took down the diapers drying before the hearth . With a sigh of contentment , he sank down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The quiet of the house without the babies ' screams and laughter or his wife 's persistent shrill voice or the country giggles of the serving-maid ( who had been allowed to visit her mother forp311this week ) soothed him . So Fenton was marrying , was he ? And would live in Cousin Macey 's old house on High Street , which had been bought with part of the bride 's ample dower . There had been much talk of the changes the young girl had ordered . The shop had been made over into a carriage-house . For she must have a carriage . She was not the one to ride abroad on a pillion behind husband or servant . Again and again Christopher had heard the words , " Star must have soand-so , or this-and-that . There was no talk of what Fenton ( and now a major , commanding all the forts of Boston ) wished . It would seem as if Fenton had at last met his match in a miss barely turned sixteen . Salome had arranged that Phoebe was to come over from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had explained , again and again , exactly how it was Mr. Christopher liked his gruel . He liked rye but not injun . He preferred wild game to stall-fed meat . Spiced eels were his detestation . But when Phoebe arrived he told her he preferred to prepare his own food . He was to be left alone . He shut himself in his study and went on with his Vocabularyof the Algonquin Language . And he was well content . Towards nightfall , Billy Bright brought over a crock of milk . He drank this and ate some bread for his supper . The house , silent and empty of all but himself , relaxed him . He was nodding by eight , and at nine he was in bed . For a week he saw no one to speak to but the lad Billy Bright and old Clara-Wood-Tree from Swamp Town . He had found that she was the best of the Swamp Town Indians for his purpose . Like a great sow , she would squat on his study floor , smoke her pipe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say , " why do you Indians have two words for turtle ? Hanawa is the word I learned as a lad , and yet you say hadimides as well . " Then she would explain in her stupid way and in her own tongue that the first is just a turtle but the second word means " they who have upright necks . " To call a man a hanawa is an insult  --  but hadimides a compliment . " And why have you five words for corn ? " He saw , as she explainedthese common things , that the language , which at first had seemed a veritable savage tangle , had both delicacy and strength . It was Clara who would always terminate these visits . Suddenly she would get up from the far corner where she squatted , put out her paw for a copper coin , grunt , and leave him . And the next day she would come back . If he did not use her she would sit for hours without speaking  --  smokingand scratching . Totonic had not proved as useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too restless and too absent-minded . Christopher guessed he actually did not know the language of his fathers as well as did the low-born squaw . Then he always wanted a drink for his pains . Twice of late , Colonel Coffin had set him in the stocks for drunkenness . Gossip said that one of his wives was Johnny Pigge , but when the Constable and the Judge had come to question , Totonic had slyly hidden the Cornish girl and produced another young woman . So it was well known the sachem had two wives , but the Colonel had dismissed as only gossip the story that one of these was a renegade white woman . On the ninth day of his solitude , shortly after Clara had taken her coin and gone , Christopher began to wonder if bread and cheese were enough for his supper . The cheese seemed over-ripe to him . He held it close to his tilted girlish nose and carefully sniffed it . There was a sharp knock on the kitchen door . This surprised him , for the door was open . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bathsheba stood before him . Since Fenton had repudiated her ( and paid the heavy fine demanded by the General Court for her bigamy ) and she had become a servant in the house where once she had been mistress , Bathsheba had grown slack in her dress . Her jumps were often old and broken , her petticoats soiled , and her hair untended . But for this visit she had put on the gorgeous gown of dark rust silk which matched her hair and brought out the porcelain fairness of her skin . True , her hands looked a little red and rough , but her arms and bosom were of alabaster . He could not find the words to tell her that her presence was unwanted , but this was the truth . She had been something in his life  --  at least in the life of a man also called ChristopherParre  --  but that was long ago . Seeing her like this , beautiful and handsomely dressed , something of his old longingrose in him . He could not ask her in  --  not into Salome 's house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife was stronger than this resurgent emotion towards Bathsheba . She did not look at him but turned her head and gazed thoughtfully at the river . He could see that perfect little profile . " I thought I should like to see Jake and Varney . When Salome is here , she is so fond over them she wo n't even let me touch them . " " But did n't you know ? Salome took them to Fent . . . to Boston with her . " " No , I did not know . I thought they were here with you . " There had been so much talk about the wisdom of taking these nine-months-old babies to Boston Christopher could hardly believe that Bathsheba had heard nothing of it . He was nonplussed and fiddled nervously with the wooden latch of the door . But he had often seen Bathsheba in the last few months , unspeaking and unspoken to , wandering about the kitchen of Paradise . He wondered how much she listened to what was said . " I wish they were here , Bathsheba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me they are stout and seemly boys . I 'm not much of a judge on such matters . " " Oh ! " He waited restlessly for her departure . " Kit , " she said at last in a wheedling voice , " if I may not see the twins , may n't I walk through your house ? " He hesitated . " Yes  --  if you wish . " She passed rapidly through the kitchen and into the new part of Founder 's . She stood in a large panelled room and gazed about her . " The parlour , " she whispered . Salome and Christopher called this the hall . She picked up a silver candlestick . " The letter , " she said to herself . It was under this candlestick Christopher had left his letter for Salome Blue . " A warming-pan . " And she pointed . " Three chairs and two tables . One , two , three stools . A form . One , two , three , four flagons , and pewter enough  --  oh , say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little fire-dogs . The woodenware and crocks and iron stuff , I suppose , are in the kitchen ? A wool-wheel and a flax-wheel . Cards and such . Where 's the loom ? " Christopher , marvelling , opened a door . It was here that he had hidden away the double cradle . " Oh , a cradle ! " The woman went to it and started it rockingwith her foot . She entered the two bedchambers . One of these Christopher used for his study . With a mocking sigh she clasped her hands over Christopher 's papers and notes . " And the whole Indian language ! Yes , I 'll enumerate that too . ' T is part of the house . " Her little eyes slid hither and yon , peeking and prying . She seemed completely to have for/gotten the man who followed her in and out of the rooms , upstairsand down . Everything she counted off upon her fingers . She went to a chest , opened it , and slapped it shut again . " I 'll not stop now to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She pinched a mattress . " That 's live-goose feathers , and I know , for Goody Goad gave it to me . And that blue quilt  --  it is mine really . Salome made it and gave it to me . ' T is mine by rights , Kit . Ah , well . . . . " And she laughed quite naturally , seeming to come out of her maze . " Half the stuff in this house is mine by rights . But you are welcome to it . Indeed you are ! I need but little these days . " She had led the way back into the kitchen and now stood once more upon the threshold . " Well , sir , I 'll be gone . " But she made no move to go . In agony Christopher waited her going . She said in a low voice , " Fenton is married now ? " " Yes . " " And you are married and Salome is married and Jazan is to be , soon . Oh , why , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . ? " " Hush . You are young yet . And now that you are a widow . . . " " Am I young ? " She pulled back her mop of orange curls and made him stare at her face and the purple A upon her forehead . Christopher 's A had almost faded away . Without the frame of hair she did not look young at all . Christopher was shocked and uncomfortable . " Kit , " she said , " I am exactly ten years older than you . I am thirty-five years old . " She let the hair fall once more about her face . " If you had not married her , would you have married me  --  now that I am indeed a widow ? "  | He took a long time in answering her . The lines in his cheeks deepened . " Yes  --  I would . " " Branded and old , outcast and sinful  --  even such a one you would have married ? " " Yes , I would . " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize how wonderful ? Loyal and faithful and good . Oh , Christopher , I could kneel to a man like you . " If he had not caught her arm she would have knelt . " Let me go , " she cried shrilly , as though there had been something improper in his restraining hand upon her arm . " Sir , let me go ! " And she bounded away and was scurrying over the foot-bridge to Paradise . So the time he had dreaded and dreamed of had come . They had not spoken alone since they had been taken together at Providence . Often he had planned to himself what he would say when this time came . But there had been nothing to say . As he turned back into his solitary dwelling every corner seemed filled with Salome 's presence : her knitting upon the settle , the knife she fancied most for paring , her old blue cloak hanging upon a peg . And he wished she were back once more . THAT winter Christopher went from Indian encampment to encampment , working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trudged over to Founder 's and bore his wife unwanted company . Salome silently watched her as she paced the house , counting its gear upon her fingers , nodding to herself and smiling . She would hang over the twins ' cradle for hours and Salome knew by her murmured wordsp317that Bathsheba pretended that these were her sons  --  hers and Fenton 's  --  that Founder 's was her house and Salome her servant . It was after Fenton 's infrequent visits to Paradise that Bathshebaseemed the most fitful . Sometimes she would shut herselfinto the boys ' room and all day sit there humming and talking to herself . Sometimes the very sight of Fenton riding into the yard would send her off by herself for twenty-four hours . It was winter-time . What she did , where she slept , what she ate , no one knew , but many wondered . One cold winter night Jazan woke hearing a cry of " Fire , fire ! " The farm servants were running down from the loft , and she heard Gervase commanding one of them to get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the window in the hall that Founder 's was afire . The smell of the smoke , the crackling of the fire , and the flaunting banners of flame promised little could be done to save the house . Soon all Canaan  --  men , women , and children  --  were forming a bucket line from the doomed house to a hole chopped through the ice of the river . Ladders were set and shingles torn away . Jazan stayed in the kitchen at Paradise , keeping hot food and drink ready for all . Women had come to the fire with babies in their arms , and now sat about discussing in shrill voices how it might have started and how far it was like to go . There had been a pile of swingling tow in a shed , they said . It was there the fire had started . All the addition was burned away . The old house , which was of wattle and daub , cat and clay , would doubtless be saved . The family had barely escaped with their lives . Salome 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had woven , thinking it was Fenton whom she would marry , were not saved . The pewter she had hoarded her pennies to buy melted . Her spinning-wheel , loom , her wooden trenchers , churns , tubs  --  everything that was dearest to her  --  all was destroyed . And Christopher 's Vocabulary of the Algonquin Language  --  all that was left of that was whatever might be in his mind . Salome sat in the kitchen of Paradise , looking through soot at the people gathered about her . In vain did Mr. Fearing tell her that she was lucky to have preserved her life and to have her sons and her husband safe . She was brokenhearted , and tears washed clean rivulets upon her face . Jake and Varney seemed frightened into unusual goodness by the night 's adventure . They let Goody Goad put them to bed in a pallet in the kitchen . More and more of the neighbours came crowding in . Yes , the men said , the old part of Founder 's had been saved . No one had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick curiosity about her , and she took a candle and went up the stairs . She knocked on the door . " Bathsheba ? " There was no answer , but she heard bed cords creak within . She entered . The light of her candle showed the woman , fully dressed , sitting on the edge of her bed . She peered at her erstwhilesister  --  now her mistress . She was hunched up into but small space , and her expression was both sly and diffident . The bottom of her skirt was dark , as though with water , and her shoes were wet as well . This Jazan noticed . " You had already been to the fire ? " " No , I have been here all the time . " She corrected herself . " I did cross over and looked out the serving wenches ' rooms to see . " Jazan wanted to say , but your skirt and shoes are wet . She paused and said , " You are all dressed to go ? "  | " No . I often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I do walk about . " " But you should not walk about at night . " The woman gave her a pretty look . " I walk about . " Jazan set a trap for her . " Have you stayed inside of Paradise all tonight ? " " As God lives , I have not been off this upper floor since evening prayers . " But your shoes and your skirts are wet . . . . She thought the words but did not say them . A silence brooded between them , which Bathsheba was the first to break . She said with passion , " If their house burns it will serve them right . It is my house  --  mine ! They have no right to live there . " " Salome has always been kind to you , and Christopher suffered grievously for that he tried to help you . You could not wish their house to burn over their heads ? This night they have lost everything dear to them  --  except life itself . All Salome 's household stuff . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small voice , " I am sorry , " then tossed her head petulantly ; and something of her old wilful beauty looked out from her little eyes . " They should not live there . Salome is not my friend . I think she has always hated me . Ever since first she saw me with that precious Fenton Parre ! And those babies . . . it would have served them right if they had burned up  --  along with the livegoosemattress and the blue quilt ! And . . . " She put up her fingers to begin enumerating upon them all the household things at Founder 's . Jazan interrupted her . " Hush yourself , Bathsheba . Let Salome count her loss . ' T is no affair of yours . "  | " They should have been my children . Oh , Jazan ! " And she began to weep . " That 's no reason for burning up other people 's children . " She was sure this woman had fired the swingling tow in the shed . " Do n't look so at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why does n't anyone like me any more ? You do n't . And Fenton . . . Not even Kit . No one does except Mr. Fearing . Oh , he is an angel ! He is the only person who has been kind to me since your father died . I 'd do anything for him  --  but nothing for you . " Jazan thought a little bitterly how many times she had lessened this woman 's labours , had tried to make life endurable for her . Love her she could not . " Bathsheba , " she said , speaking a little coldly as a mistress might to a serving-woman , " I wish you would heed Goody 's advice . Conduct yourself in seemly wise , and somewhere we will find a husband for you . " " A husband for me ? Never ! I 've had three of the worthless things already . That is , if you count Kit one . " " I hardly should . But you must listen to reason . I am sorry that . . . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fenton , save your money ! I want no husband . I prefer to walk as I please . And I do n't always walk , either . " Her face , which had begun to look wild and haggard , softened with laughter . Her voice dropped , and she went on in her ordinary tones : " A week ago I was in Marlborough  --  and that 's God 's truth ! And there before the grist-mill I did see Mercuricus English . Now I will tell you one thing . He may have courted you for three years , in honour and under your father 's roof , but me has he been after , in dishonour , for a year and more . Oh , I 'd none of him ! I tell you men are not worth the havoc they brew . But seeing me thus ,  |p321alone  , he made up to me . Asked how I had gotten so far from Canaan . So I told him that I had come in my wolf shape . . . . ' T is fast and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have seen his face . He 'll pester me no more  --  for he believed what I said . " " Bathsheba , you must not even play with such dangerous words . Many besides Mercuricus will believe your  --  fables . " " Well , " she said logically , " I have to do something , do n't I ? Besides mind pots and gather herbs , scour and spin for Goody Goad ? And do n't you worry about my wits , nor think I would ever set a fire  --  for I know what was in your mind , Jazan Parre . You saw my petticoats had been dragged through snow . The truth is I did but go to the privy a moment or two before you came to me . ' T is no matter for a servant to mention to her mistress , so I did not tell . A poor serving-woman may go to the privy  --  may she not ?  --  without telling her mistress . " At last Jazan left her . At first she had no doubt but Bathshebahad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such suspicionwas nonsense . SALOME sat on the pallet in the kitchen , nursing the two boys who had now awakened . She did not look to have milk enough to satisfy a mouse . She told everyone that she nursed these two over-long to escape another pregnancy . Christopher had been angry with her ( she did not know why ) that she had had two children so soon after marriage  --  although it really was not very soon . The plump , ruddy creatures fastened to her thin breasts like leeches . There was nothing pretty about Salome 's maternity , but her face had an uplifted look . Finally she spoke to her sister-in-law . " Jazan , for some time Christopher and I have talked of offering ourselves as missionaries to the Indians . John Eliot has told Kit that it is a wicked thing to amass knowledge year after year and not use it . Now all his notes are burned . I think before this he would have gone , followed the command of our Lord , Go ye out . . . ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my security , my home , my babies , too . Tonight the Lord has shown me his way . He has taken away my house . . . . " She stopped , swallowed back her tears , and continued bravely , " You remember , Jazan , how I was laughed at , some years ago . . . for my great spinning ? I was always preparing for a wedding that God did n't seem to sanction  --  for it never came . All those sheets and blankets , towels and covers  --  everything was burned tonight . " Varney , being satisfied , was laid back on the pallet , but Jake sucked on . " I believe it is the Lord speaking to me  --  and Mr. Fearing thinks so as well . I believe the time will come when I can say , Oh , blessed fire that burned away my avarice , my sinful love of ease . ' " Surely Salome 's life had never been one of ease . " How can you leave your sons ? " " The Lord will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of them if Kit pays her well . And it will be better for them to have parents who labour patiently in the Lord 's vineyardrather than amass great wealth . . . and many sheets . From now on , Christopher and I stand shoulder to shoulder in this matter . He has wanted to go to Mr. Eliot for long . I held him back with my selfish desires . " AT last Goody Goad had the satisfaction of turning Bathsheba out of the boys ' room , which was now needed for the Chris/topher Parres . Like it or not , she was to sleep with Jessie and Phoebe . Bathsheba raised her eyebrows , did not complain ; and behind the Goodwife 's back she sought out Christopher . Humbly , she said she had one request only . Would her master permit her to remove herself across the river ? The old part of Founder 's still stood . It wrung the man 's heart to see anyone who had been so proud now so reduced . She was coarsely dressed in a hempen apron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange hair . Founder 's  --  what remained of it  --  was his . Quickly he granted the unfortunate woman 's request ; but she must look sharp , he said , that every morning she got over to work by sunrise . Ay , she 'd look sharp , she said , and laughed a stinging laugh . " And one thing more , Master , a few odd ends to furnish my home for me ? May n't I have this-and-that ? " " What is it you wish  --  under the name of this-and-that ' ? " " Why , just a little of the household gear in the boys ' room that I have come to love during these last six months . " This , too , he granted . Then he and Salome rode away to John Eliot in Natick . He did not see Bathsheba 's removal  --  which was odd enough . Goody Goad had resented her master 's promise to " the most worthless female I ever did see " of not only separate dwelling but the furniture out of the boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bedspread , goose-feather-bed , stools , and standing table the woman wanted . All those useful things she left behind . For the day of her removal Bathsheba put on her sumptuous rust-coloured silk and over it a green cloth cloak lined with beaver and furnished with a beaver hood , and she carried a small beaver muff . On her feet were purple shoes , which she protected from the slush of the melting February day by clogs . ' These clogs gave her a mincing , highty-tighty gait and added some four inches to her already sufficient height . Her eyebrows , which , untended , were mere dabs of orange fuzz , she had narrowedand darkened for the first time in many months . And she smiled and hummed to herself , looked about her slyly , and spoke to no one . But everyone watched her as she laboriouslycrossed back and forth over the foot-bridge , lovingly toting the moth-eaten beaver skin with the white mark , snarls of fishing tackle , old books , boots , bits , dog collars , the wolfskinfrom the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hooks behind the door . Jazan and Forethought Fearing stood side by side in the hall , peering out a casement window at her . Phoebe , brushing the hearth with a turkey wing , shook her head . She said Bathshebawished the possessions of the two young men  --  each of whom had loved her  --  so she might work some witchcraft upon them . " Oh , nonsense , you foolish wench , " Forethought reproved her . Although superstitious enough when it came to the page to which his Bible opened , he did not hold with the country mind which sees a witch in every lonely female . " She has sinned , " he said , " and indeed she has confessed her sin and repented . " This was too true for the comfort of many . Ever since Bathsheba had become a servant in the house where formerly she had been mistress , her mind seemed strongly drawn towards religion . Jazan knew what an embarrassmentshe was to Forethought , and she admired his patience with her . Over and over ( when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been forced to sit assuring the servant that her soul was not lost . At his suggestion , she confessed her sins before the entire congregation . But one confession did not satisfy her , and if ever there was an opportunity , she was standing up in meetingand confessing again . She had been the most miserable ofp325sinners . She had sinned with Major Parre and with Mr. Parre . The brand upon her forehead was nothing compared to the brand upon her heart . Sometimes a young maid would giggle during these confessions ; and Christopher , sitting among the men , would redden ; and Salome , upon the women 's side , would turn white . So Jazan and Forethought stood together by a casement window in the hall , and the man tried to explain again the faith he had in Bathsheba 's struggle for redemption . But even he was a little nonplussed when they heard a bumping down the stairway and in a few minutes Bathsheba , in clogs and muff , was seen dragging an enormous bear trap over the bridge to Founder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hut ( that was all it now was ) for charms and magic potions . Canaan had had no witch before and many had felt the need . Goody Goad purged for every ailment . Surely the heart and body often sickened beyond the power of purging . A child reported that once passing the hut he had heard a man and woman laughing and talking together . On peeking through the window he had seen " Dame Sheba " alone . She sat before a great pot bubbling upon her hearth fire and addressedherself to this pot . The lid rose up . Steam and a man 's voice came from within . Mercuricus English swore that in Marlborough she had changed from a woman to a she-wolf shape . No  --  he had not seen the change but he knew it had happened . She cured Phoebe Bemis of a wart with a toad 's skin . Once in passing Baileys ' Acres she had stopped to gossip with Judith Bailey , a heavy-minded woman kept unwed through the avarice of her father . Judith had laboured for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her guest told her that the hair of a black cat would bring the butter , and so it was . ON a sweet , sodden day of earliest spring , very late in the afternoon , Jazan stood by the river watching far overhead the arrow flight of wild geese . She heard their phantom crying . Totonic had told her how the gods of the spring , far to the south , released the wild geese from their bows . The geese came only by the hundred , the wild ducks by the thousand , but last of all the pigeons came by the millions . Mile upon mile of pigeons , breaking branches from the trees they roosted on , darkening the sky . For a short time there would be pigeons for breakfast , dinner , and supper , until everyone hated the sight of a pigeon . So the gods of spring , she thought , standing in a flowery southern world shot the wild birds north like arrows . The river was swollen with melting snow and the sky above with rain . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forethought Fearing , now for two months her espoused husband , came to her . Not even Jazan had been so fond as to tramp the delicately nurtured man through the winter ice and cold , so the past few months had been spent within doors and in decorum . She was ashamed to remember the harvest months of wanton dalliance . It had not made a bond between them , as it might have with some men , but a barrier . In the fall her conduct had seemed a little wicked to her . Now it seemed worse than wicked . It had been foolish and unkind . In the fall she had not cared . All she wished was to free herself of the memory of another man . But the winter evenings they had passed together ( and never once alone ) had changed her feel/ings for him . She pitied Forethought Fearing  --  his loneliness , his doubts , his weakness , his delicacy of mind and body . She regretted that she had offended that delicacy , and she was cautiousnow how she comported herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so unlike any other man . Her love was compounded of pity , fear , and wonder of his strangeness ; but it was love . She saw he had already been to Paradise and taken from its hook the old clothes of Fenton . Reddish leathern breeches and leggings , a blue fustian shirt . She had never seen his face so beautiful , as though washed in some springs fresher even than the clean waters of Canaan . He looked young , not merely in years as other men may look , but in centuries , as though he came from far away and long ago , from the hey-day of the world . She thought of the Greeks whom her father had loved . " Oh , Forethought , " she cried , for she saw in his eyes that something had happened . Then he told her that a change had come upon Mr. Redbank . Utterly had he forgotten the peevish months when he had only wept at the thought of his assistant 's marrying . " It was he who sent me to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows I am set up here at Paradise with you for wife . He can not understand why I have been so tardy . Never had I the heart to tell him ' t was he who held me back . " Now might they marry when they chose , and the months of waiting were over . Forethought made no movement towards the lady who might so soon be his bride . He started a lengthy dissertation on how the Puritans , in taking away all religious significance to marriage ( wishing to break utterly with popish artifice ) , had degraded it . " For among us marriage is little more than a business partnership . No wonder there has been much divorce in the Bay Colony ; and the Anglican and the Roman Church both fling that against us . For a man and woman do not pledge themselves before God but before a Justice of the Peace only . " Jazan knew that it had always irked him that clergymen were not allowed to perform the marriage ceremony . " My father was bred to the Anglican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only  --  that never might he attend one of our chilly merchantman weddings but he was homesick for the old ritual . He believed , and I as well , that marriage is a state of sanctity . For it is between a man , a woman , and God , not a man , a woman , and the state . " Jazan had never heard marriage referred to as " sanctified " or " holy . " You might as well talk about a holy mortgage ! The night and the rain were coming down upon them . " Oh , this rain , " he cried in exasperation , " I have much more to say , and yet we must seek a roof ; and I 'm in no mood for Paradise and all that bustling household and all those open ears ! " Close beside them was Fenton 's fur house and the door was carelessly ajar . " Surely it is a shower only . Let 's slip in here a moment and then it will be over . " They went inside . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of beaver skins made luxurious seats for them , and gave off a sweet , wild fragrance of fur and bark , for the Indians did not cure hides with urine and brains , as did the white men , but herbs and bark . They sat side by side , and the rain rattled on the roof close above their heads . " Jazan , " he said , pressing the hand he held , " do you know the old Prayer Book lines ? Of course , ' t is a heretic literature , but it contains much beauty and truth . " " Say them out to me . " " Dearly beloved , we are gathered together in the sight ofp329God . . . " and with no faltering or change of that impassioned voice he went through to the end . When it was the woman 's turn to speak he bade her repeat after him . He took upon himselfthe words of clergyman and groom . Not until the last line was said , " that ye may so live together in this life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everlasting , Amen , " did he turn his shadowy face to her . " Thus , " he said , " have we promised between ourselves . Let Colonel Coffin hear our vows to the civil state . You and I , Jazan , have repeated those awful words before God , and they shall be more binding upon us than anything a garrulous Justiceof the Peace may think up for us to say . " He kissed her on the cheek . " Sir , you mean we are married now ? " " Ay , before God , " he said , " our souls are indeed wed , but our bodies must wait upon Colonel Coffin . " His last words reassured her a little , but she wished to be out from under this heavy roof . She remembered once seeing Johnny Pigge and Fenton meet before the fur house and enter . Wordless they both had been but their eyes knowing . And she herself a maid with hair still loose upon her shoulders had known and been ashamed . She thought how little this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little , knowing girl of long ago . She was not her own self to him but the fulfilment of some dream . Her self he might not even like  --  provided he ever knew it . She turned and clung to him in passion and a fear of losing this man so lightly poised and changeable . " Forethought , you will never leave me ? " She meant never go back to the stern monastic faith that once had enveloped him  --  in which she could have no part . " Never , never , " he promised . His cheek pressed to hers , hisp330hands lightly fondling her body . She felt his breath steady upon her . He was calm and sure of himself , and she was sure of him . He caressed her gently , and she was moved as she never had been by those frenzied moments in the woods when tears would fill his eyes and his hands would shake and she knew he half despised her and she half despised him for his weakness . " Oh , no . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for she could not doubt what rashness he intended . " You yourself said Colonel Coffin . . . " And " You have broke a laurel busk in my bodice , " she said , trying to speak naturally . " Forethought , it is sticking into me . " In the dark his fingers found the lacing and untied the knot . " I 've heard tell , " he whispered with laughter in his voice , " that loving one of our well-stayed modern ladies is like loving a laurel tree . So let the laurel turn back to a Daphne , sweetheart . . . sweet nymph . " And again she thought of the golden Greeks . In the fall all the strength had been in her . Now their roles were reversed , and she delighted that it was so . She had learned in the winter that he would brook little contradiction , and as she had come to love him she had come to fear his disapproval . Then to her breast he whispered so impious a thing that even she was shocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and his voice broke.  |p331MARCH  26 , 167o . The date was cut upon slatestone and set up in the burial-ground . It wasMr . Redbank 's death-day . As long as JazanParre lived the sight of this stone ( and its date ) would mean but one thing to her  --  the smell of Fenton 's furs , darkness and rain upon a low roof , Forethought Fearing'slove . Yet for her too this was a death-day . The following Sabbath was the first time Forethought Fearingpreached to Canaan . Mostly he read from the written word before him . His text was " For the woman tempted me and I did eat . " It came like a thunder-clap after the loving , tedious words of the dead man . He blasted lewdness and dissolute living , spoke against gaudy and immodest attire . Hell itself crackled about the roof busses and the main trusses and the tiebeamand the king-post of the old meeting-house . Bathsheba sat with her face in her hands . Once she moaned . Rue Redbank ( now Rue Bailey ) clenched her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her dead grandfather . He had been planted less than a week . Now all his life had stood for was set at naught . Colonel Coffin nodded in approval . How good did taste this solid meat after the pap Mr. Redbank had been spooning out to them ! Preserved English , the smith , was whispering to his Mercuricus . It was never for such beliefs he had carried his pike at Marston Moors . Hagar 's eyes flashed with joy . So now she understood Mr. Fearing 's shilly-shallyings . As long as Mr. Redbank lived he had been too courteous to take a firm stand against his doc/trines . Now he was free ! Now , now he spoke as behoved his Fearing blood ! Jazan Parre had a taffeta hood about her head half coveringa face which had been white to start with and now grew whiter yet . The wide round eyes stared soberly at the figure in the pulpit . Cloak and hood were of the blackish purple of a flea 's back and dotted over with tiny embroidered flowers . Her dress was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the clergyman 's words . Were these the words of the man she was about to marry ? Forethought had not come to Paradise during the last five busy days . There had been Mr. Redbank 's death and burial . This , his first sermon to write out . . . but had he himself written it ? She had a flash of knowledge . It was a sermon of his father 's ( barrels of Fearing sermons  --  enough to last a lifetime ) . Yet some he had added for himself . Never had old Peter objected to fine clothing for fine people . This command for sober raiment she traced not to his father but to Hagar . Often had she heard the two argue this matter together . Hagar had won , had she ? Hagar and the stout old ghost of Peter Fearing . Now she saw there was another reason why he had not wished to see her : that old cry , " The woman tempted me and I did eat . . . . " The next day Forethought Fearing borrowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter the house , he saw no one but Gervase Blue . He said he was riding to Boston to make the final arrangements with Fenton Parre in regard to his marriage with Jazan . " And while there , " Hagar had added to Gervase 's story , " he will pack the six thousand volumes of the great Fearing library . Now that we have a passable cart path all the way outp333from Boston , the books can come by waggon . " Fenton had used his influence about Boston to have the pack-horse trail enlarged for wheels . And Hagar knew ( but Jazan did not ) that Mr. Fearing was going to take the West Chamber for his study . " T' other day he told me so , " she said . " When was t' other day ' ? " Jazan asked . " The day after Mr. Redbank 's burial . I met him as he came out of the meeting-house . And he said now there was no choice for it . The marriage should be gone through with . " But to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hagar enlarged upon the joy it would be to have both Mr. Fearing and the Fearing library dwelling here at Paradise . Her sister wondered if now she would ever wish to marry Abraham Blue and set up in a house of her own . Jazan , in spite of Forethought 's ominous silence , could not take the matter very seriously . She knew great laxity was permitted to betrothed pairs . Never once had her father reported to a higher court any young couple whose first child was born early . Familiarity after betrothal and before marriage was a common sin among the Puritans . A legally betrothed woman was neither maid nor wife . If she were unfaithful to her chosen man , she was punished as for adultery . Forethought could not be taking the matter so much to heart . She thought of the hours in the fur house . How loving and sure of himself he had been ! And how sure of him had she been ! What was the beautiful old Bible phrase ? And such a man " knew " the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had . But now  --  this silence ! At the end of another week , muddy ox carts creaked through the gates of Paradise . There , under tarpaulins , was the Fearing library . It had come but Forethought had not . The books were unpacked and piled high in the West Chamber , even as Hagar ordered . But Jazan sickened a little . She whistled to the dogs and walked for an hour and more over the deserted Sheep Walks towards Sudbury . At last , when he did come , he brought Tom Pigge and young Seth Bailey with him . Both these men were carpenters and joiners . He greeted his espoused wife with courtesy and began to explain  --  but to no one person in particular  --  that , with Major Parre 's consent , bookshelves should be built from floor to ceiling of the West Chamber . He had been to the saw-pit and ordered seasoned wood . It would come today . In the meantime , let the carpenters begin with the old table-board . So , without discussion , the matter was settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Goody Goad retired to the privacy of the privy to weep . Tom Pigge measured , squared , and planed . Then he spat upon his hands and soon his saw buzzed through the soft pine-wood . The table-board was ended , and all it stood for . Seth , the Younger , sighed once and shook his head . Soon he would be back at Baileys ' Acres , telling his bride : " We have sawn up the tableboardat Paradise for to make shelves for the Fearing library . . . . " From floor to ceiling would stretch the books , soothing to the eye with their brown leather and gold bindings . Although Forethought was busy with his plans , he showed none of the enthusiasm a man commonly shows for a new dwelling . It seemed to Jazan he was going through the matter  --  even to the arranging of his books  --  as though it were an ill matter but not to be avoided . Any time now , the couple might go on to the nuptials . Jazan felt she could not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word had always been difficult to arrange for at Paradise , but at last she saw her chance and took it.  |p335It  came upon a rainy day , and Mr. Redbank had been dead for two weeks . The house , lighted only by tiny diamond panes , was dark , damp , and broody . Against the panes the rain washed . It blew down the chimney , and the smell of soot and smoke was everywhere . It drummed upon the peaks and gables of the ageing house . Fearing was alone in that room he had chosen for himself , and he was fortifying it with books against the rest of Paradise , as a blockhouse is fortified against the Indians by a lining of brick , fortifying himself against Paradise , the world , and perhaps against herself . She came to him , and he sat upon a tiny step-ladder , his head against the summer beam . " Forethought , I want to talk with you . Now  --  if you are in the mood . " " Of course . Any time you wish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He came down from off his ladder . " Would it not suit you , " he asked , brushing the dust from his fingers and indicating the great canopied bed , " if we set up this formidable galleon in our own bedchamber ? For I intend that we sleep in the bedroom you once shared with your sisters . Close by the chimney and off the kitchen , ' t is the warmest room in the house . " " Will it go in ? " " Just and barely . I have measured . Of course , Hagar has slept there of late , but she is most agreeable to moving herself upstairs . " " If you wish , we might cut a door through the partition . Then you would not have to go from bedroom to kitchen and kitchen to hall and hall to entry to reach your study . " It was not of such matters she wished to speak . " No , no  --  never . " He spoke sharply . " I wish to keep these two ideas utterly apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know  --  as I always have  --  meditating by myself , alone . " He picked up an armful of pamphlets and made as though to ascend the ladder again . She must not let him escape her . " Forethought , why did you preach that sermon ? Am I right in one thing ? You did not write it yourself . You read one of your father 's ? " She regretted the words as she said them . His sensitive face receded from her , and he looked at her from out a mask . " You are right . " " And why did you so , Forethought ? " The mask muttered , " You should know . " She knew . " Forethought , I am sorry that things went as they did betwixt us . " " I am twice as sorry  --  nay , a hundred times more sorry than you . " " If you do wish , this marriage need go no further . You must know Fenton has not set his heart upon it . He will never sue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bindings of the books . For the first time , she did not like these finegentlemanfingers  --  too delicate they looked . " Forethought , " she pleaded , " do not take this sin to heart ! ' T is but a little sin . " " Exactly what I expected you to say . And now you 'd have me refuse marriage  --  and thus add little sin ' upon little sin ' ? And Fenton would doubtless be agreeable , as you say . You Parres are not too finicky with your little sins . ' Neither Fenton , Christopher , nor you . " She did not speak . " True , what may happen betwixt an espoused pair is small compared to fornication betwixt single man and maid . " She flushed and her eyes faltered at the grim way he rolled out the ugly Latin word.  | " Would you rather put off the marrying  --  a little ? " " I shall insist upon that until you can swear to me that no child of mine was begotten in our sin . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedlock is damned utterly  --  unless the parentsmake full church confession . " Only a few months before he had told her that he did not hold with infant damnation . This , he had said , was contrary to the spirit of Christ . She did not resent his words as much as she pitied his despair and confusion . " I can tell you now in a week 's time , " she said . It gave her a sense of intimacy with him , for she never before had spoken of such matters to any man and she felt her words indeed bound them together . Now did he not only know the nakednessof her body , but how in its rhythms it followed the waxingand waning of the moon . He did not seem to hear her words  --  which meant much to her . He was fingering a powderingold folio of theology . He did not feel the importance of this new intimacy . She turned to leave him , and he called to her . Softly , he called her name . It did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anyone else . Soft , low , and sweet , it sounded . " Jazan , " and she saw that the mask had dropped a little from his face , " why did you tempt me so ? " She did not argue with him , although to a logical mind it might seem that he was as much at fault as she . They spoke softly . Generously , Jazan admitted the guilt of that night was hers . Thus they were set in a pattern from which there was no escape . From that time forth , whatever went wrong was the woman 's fault . Forethought would always be right . For at that moment  --  when he said her name and the mask she feared slipped from his face  --  she had no wish for herself ; only to lift a little from his soul the burden of his guilt . Let it rest upon her . Was she not , as he said , after all , only a Parre ? Parres can carry guilt . And falter not under the load . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her that once his father had said that never until he had sinned would he fully understand man 's humble need of God . He had been too proud , he said , and God had punished him . She saw his face was waxen and his lips dry . She pitied his despair and yet had no sympathy with it . She noted that their sin was first her fault and next the punishment of God . Never was it his fault ! She grew cold and frightened as women always must when first they realize that it is not a strong man they are marrying but a weak child . A smile trembled on his crooked lips . " Jazan , do not desert me . Sometimes you seem all that I have left upon this earth and all in Heaven . " She laid a gentle arm about his bowed shoulders . She feared he might weep . He raised his head . " It was never inertia , " he said , " that made me read out my father 's sermon on lewd women and coarse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on I am his son . Oh , I have gone this way and gone that ! Those days are over . I have sinned and now I know ! " Yet she guessed that Forethought would push matters farther than ever his father would have done . This talk of " unworldliness "  --  surelyForethought never got that from his father . Two weeks later , they stood before Colonel Coffin and were married . FORETHOUGHT FEARING went to work reforming Canaan . The time was ripe for him . For two years Mr. Redbankhad preached most childishly upon God 's love . " Little children , love one another " had been his text for some thirtyp339or forty sermons . This was a good thought  --  but it had grown thin with repetition . The congregation had tended to sleep . Now they woke up . And the tithingmen might put away the cunning staffs they had for those who slept at Sabbath services . Everyone sat on the edge of the pew to hear Mr. Fearing . He went at his flock ( which had for years been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not threaten them , except only in that first sermon , but persuaded . It was not alone through the pulpit that he worked . Almost without their knowing it , discipline was tightened through Canaan and tightenedagain . He divided the township into small groups for weekday readings and prayers . By the end of summer seven such groups had been formed . Forethought would go from group to group , but he was too tactful to sit out an evening with any of them . They loved his simple going-about amongst them . His mind gained an ascendency over theirs . In the old days the tithingmen had been unpaid and their offices light . On Sabbaths they kept order at meeting and turned ( and turned again ) the great hour-glass before the pulpitas the minister preached . To each tithingman was assigned so and so many families ; and these he was to watch and report upon . Sabbath infringements , rude talk between married folk or lewd talk among the single , neglect of children or cruelty to domestic animals or servants , drunkenness , swearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch sharply . Very nominal had their work been in the days of Mr. Parre and Mr. Redbank , for neither of these gentlemen cared for a spy system . " Look into your own field and cultivate that , " Jude Parre used to say , " do not always be leaning over the fence seeing weeds in your neighbour 's crops . " Now Colonel Coffin and Mr. Fearing got together and made a powerful weapon out of the old system . It was the minister who was of so pretty a mind as to suggest that the tithingmen be paid for every error they reported . The number of offences increased tremendously , and Forethought was always reaching into his wallet to pull out another coin . Much misconduct that had been going on for many a year was now reported . It was aired abroad that Goody Orde , the taverner 's wife and town bakeress , commonly set her Monday 's batch of bread to rise upon the Sabbath , that Bathsheba ( officially the " Widow Bliss " ) dressed in silks and laces unfitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was addicted to gallantry and profitless fowling , that the Baileys paid their farm servants less than the wages determined by law , that Gervase Blue during spring lambing absented himself from meeting only to play midwife to ewes . So , as soon as the tithingmen began to get money for their sharp eyes , they saw much . Colonel Coffin was for haling all these folk to court , but Fearing was wiser . He sought these people out singly and talked with them  --  usually with great success . Bathsheba wept and wept , and forswore ( for the moment ) fine raiment . But he struck a rock when he came against Gervase Blue , really his own servant . For the first time in her life Jazan heard her husband 's voice strident with anger . These two men hated each other unreasonably and always . Hagar loved this new way of life . Humbly she vowed that , although by law gentlewomen were permitted silks , laces , buckles , lockets of gold , decked hair , and great sleeves , she would eschew them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own way and wore with careless ease the fine , gallant fashions of the period , with their low bodices , cut , curled , and flowing hair , knotted sleeves , and embroidered gloves.  |p341Hagar  took upon herself the title of " tithingmaid , " a thing never heard of before . She got no pay for her pains , but she did ferret out and report upon many a small matter . Once she had the audacity to tell Mr. Fearing that his wife set no good example . The nakedness of her bosom and arms was not to the best interests of Canaan . But Fearing perversely did not wish his wife to change the manner of her dress . He was gently born and liked it that his wife went bravely dressed in good fashion . Ile was irritated by Hagar 's criticism . " Well , Sister , " he said , " I admire that it pleases you to adopt a sober raiment , but I do not criticize Jazan that she forgets not the wealth and position of the Parres and the Fearings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a thing she never could abide . She tossed her head . " No harm ? Then you have not seen what I have seen . " " And what was that , Sister ? " " Why , yesterday , the men were so busy over the Indian corn they carried their dinner to the fields with them . And Jazan went to them at nooning with cold cider from the cellar , dressed in that cramoisy gown of hers  --  half on the shoulder is it and half off  --  and sat herself on the ground with the young men . I saw Shad Penny and his brother stare at her . " He was fretted but unmoved . She went on , and now her words made him smart . " And Gervase Blue . . . he stood above her and looked down upon her as she sat  --  the way men do look down when they wish to see  --  much . . . . " That night Forethought sternly told his wife two things . She was to get herself a modesty cloth or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thicker than a cobweb ; " and likewise you are never to go to the fields no more with thep342workfolk  --  neither to carry food nor drink , nor for any other reason . And last June , Jazan , one day I saw you weeding flax barefooted and with kilted petticoats . It fits not to your station in life . You are no country wench . " " But I am a country wench . Can you not see that ? " He smiled a patronizing smile . " I have seen it  --  in the past . I hope to see it no more . " It was but a little thing and yet it cut deeply . All her life she had been much out of doors . But she was anxious , and over-anxious , to please him . " Very well . It is as you say . " She knew that among the white men ( but not among the red ) a wife is but a servant to her husband , without property and without will of her own . Yet as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the doors and windows of Paradise had blown shut and she was trapped within . Thus , during the first six months of his marrying , Forethoughtaccomplished much among the Canaanites  --  but nothing at Swamp Town . He was determined that the Indians embraceChristianity and give over their heathen ways . At first he was patient with them , but in his heart he despised them , and they knew it . He spoke to them only through the interpretation of their sachem , Totonic . The two men would stand side by side upon the dancing ground before the long house . First Mr. Fearing spoke in English and then Totonic in Algonquin . To the clergyman 's chagrin , his serious words , rephrased by the little Indian , always aroused laughter . Never had he guessed in Boston that Tawnies were so prone to giggle . They giggled at the Holy Ghost and Christ upon the Cross . They giggled over the Ten Commandments . Also he tried to help them with their agriculture  --  as had Mr. Parre years before . Tried to teach them proper care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his own purse , a yoke of oxen and gavep343it them . They ate the oxen , inviting friends and relatives from as far as Quinsigamond and Nashua to come join them at the feast . They would not give up the wandering ways of their forbears . Half the time Swamp Town was almost deserted , althoughthe General Court had passed a law that all Indians sit down soberly upon the one place only . Swamp Town was on the Catacoonamaug and that led to the Merrimac , and what the Merrimac might lead to only a few men such as Fenton Parre might guess . When they wished , the Indians got in their canoes and floated off down the river as stealthily as autumn leaves riding upon brook water . In dealing with the white men he habitually consulted his sister-in-law , but for the red men he consulted his wife . At first he urged her as a Christian duty to go much to Swamp Town . But once he had seen her sitting on the mats of Moon Goes ' hut , smoking a dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and doggerel Indian-English . He liked her no better that she was comfortable to the heathen and they to her . He bade her go no more to Swamp Town . Soon he had been told that one of Totonic 's wives was not an Indian but Johnny Pigge . He was determined to get to the bottom of the matter . Seemingly there was no bottom to any matter connected with these slippery folk . First he questioned Tom Pigge , who now wore a scarlet D sewed to his jerkin . Tom told Forethought of his Johnny 's death in too much and too contradictory detail . He decided to ask his own wife , for he believed she would know and tell the truth . Jazan sat in the hall sewing . Billy Bright was on a jointstoolbeside her . She had taken it upon herself to teach the child his letters , and every evening he came to her thus , as formerly Gervase had come . Billy was copying the alphabetp344from a horn-book she had given him , and unobserved Mr. Fearingstood at the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drew a large A upon his slate . " X " he said and drew it . And an E. Then he cleverly sketched an axe and took it to his mistress . She laughed at him lovingly and flattered him . " If only you could write as well as you do draw ! " And she bade him draw a picture of an angel for her and mind he did not write " angle " as he had last night . Billy drew everywhere  --  with charcoal and chalk on the sides of barns , on the backs of gravestones . Jazan patted his flaxen hair , cut so squarely on forehead and downy nape . Jazan loved Billy Bright , as her soft hand and eyes showed . The child withdrew happily to his stool . Forethought cleared his throat . He saw love go out of the woman 's eyes . Fear came in . This he resented . He questioned her about Totonic 's two wives . " Can it be that this Weetamoe is truly Johnny Pigge ? If so , I shall take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is a white woman ' t is an abomina-tion . " Jazan bent her deceptively innocent face to her hemming , but her heart faltered . If she was to lie to her husband she wished to do it calmly  --  not by accident . She bit off a thread and raised her eyes . " No . Johnny has long been dead . Totonic found Weetamoe on the Passaconaway . ' T is no concern of ours , sir . " Her husband believed her without another question . He returned to his study . But why was Billy Bright so silent ? She glanced at him . He sat in misery , his fair head bowed in shame for her . She felt she had had no choice but to lie in this matter . She could not bring the white men 's wrath down upon Swamp Town . It was a small moment , yet it is such  --  and not the large ones  --  that undermine a marriage . She realized that she wasp345more ashamed that a child servant had overheard her falsehoodthan that she had lied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyalty to Totonic was stronger in her than her new loyalty to her husband . This knowledge frightened her . A little coldly she bade Billy get to his bed . Mr. Fearing selected a tithingman for Swamp Town . Samuel Bull . He was Nipmuc and had been to Mr. Eliot 's Indian school at Natick , and actually could cut clapboards and shingles and read from the Up-Biblum God . Sam was a trifling knave , fawning upon the white men . When he came to Paradise he ate in the hall with the gentry , for he was a Christian and Mr. Fearing wished to show respect for his baptism . Sam Bull came often . But after Jazan 's marriage Totonic came but once . He ate in the kitchen with the servants . True , Jazan left her sister and husband and sat in the kitchen herself . At first Totonic was sullen and morose , and the servants embarrassed by their mistress 's presence . The young woman did all she might to lighten the atmosphere , and a little like her father before her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow hands and told stories and laughed and urged food and especially drink upon everyone . So it ended a merry occasion . On parting she stood at the kitchen door beside Totonic , and he tried to shake hands with her . Not understanding the custom well , he held her hand for a long time as he made a flowery speech about her father , whom he had loved with all his heart . Mr. Fearing saw this hand-holding , which was surely innocent enough . That night , when they were alone for a moment beforeevening prayers , he berated her with a coarseness of word and mood that amazed her . Could such conduct as hers be called " wanton conduct " ? And he told her she must not spoil Billy Bright . He was nine years old now , and no baby . He was not to come to her any more ; neither with his books nor drawings nor his smashed fingers . Then she realized that she had loved Billy so much only half for his own sake and half for his position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He , too , that saddest of things , a child servant . It was half for Gervase 's sake she loved him . Eight years ago she had not been old enough to give Gervase the mothering a child needs . Now she was old enough , and she gave it to Billy Bright . Then he threw up against her the name of Mercuricus English . It had been told to him , he said , that she had behaved herself badly with the tough young smith , dallying and tarryingwith him , but without thought of honest marriage to follow . This was true . She was ashamed , as she stood now before her husband . But she thought of the kisses of a heedless man 's mouth with less shame than the kisses in the eyes of Gervase Blue . Never did they get to his lips . She went early  --  and melancholy  --  to the great bed which now filled the little chamber . And on the other side of the partition was Forethought 's study , and she heard the scratchingof his pen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing but only because she was very tired . It seemed to her she was tired all the time now-a-days , although her work was light and she went no more abroad into the fields . She had tried hard to give Totonic a merry evening . That had tired her . . . . No , it was not that . She was tired because she was lonely . One door after another seemed to be slamming shut behind her . There had been no angry words between herself and her husband . She hardly knew how it happened , but he had shut one door after another and separated her from the world she knew . Nor had he opened any new door to her . He had shut her away from himself as skilfully as he had shut her away from the outside world.  |p347Now  she heard Hagar 's whisper from beyond the partition , and the scratching pen had ceased . Hagar often came to him thus in his study . But Jazan never presumed to interrupt him . She knew well from whom it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her loneliness , she prayed to God to send her a child . She knew that Forethought much wished a son " to play Forethoughtto his Peter , " and also that he would not believe their sin of March 26 , 167o ( cut upon the gravestone of Mr. Redbank ) , was forgiven them without this sign . She prayed to God for a child to share her loneliness with her . And she thought of Mary  --  gentle Mary , Mother of the world . There are many things , she saw , that ' t is easy for a woman to explain to another woman . She understood the Roman love for Mary . Hard to explain how the heart aches for a child to God or His Son or to the Holy Ghost . THAT summer Fenton Parre came out twice or thrice to Canaan . He talked with his steward about the farm but never laid down the law to him . He talked with his " Brother Fearing " about the Indians and did lay down the law . Swamp Town must be let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And you understand , sir , I will not have Totonic badgered  --  no matterhow many wives he has . The friendship of Swamp Town is more important than saving the Tawnies ' souls . So think only of their friendship and not of their souls . And send away that Sam Bull . Never saw I a more worthless red man . Even Totonic'selder brothers are not so worthless as is Bull . " Forethoughtheard him silently , but he liked not his words . After Fenton was ridden away , Forethought spoke critically of himp348to his wife . Jazan felt that it was she , not her brother , who was attacked . But she was silent . Fenton had been married for a year , and his wife had borne him a son . Yet not once had he taken her with him to Paradise . He was loath to bring Star and Bathsheba together . This was partly for the wife 's sake and partly for the servant 's . Star did not appreciate this kindness . She felt no embarrassment at the thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband told her that once more he would be gone away to Canaan ( for he wished to take part in the corn-husking ) , she said nothing , kissed him dutifully , and bade him God-speed . As soon as he was gone she ordered her pony harnessed to the yellow chaise . She dressed herself neatly and warmly , and looked thoughtfully at Anselm sleeping in his cradle . She neither kissed him nor touched his still bald head ( she was not demonstrative by nature ) , but she instructed the wet nurse and her own servants as to his proper care . At Watertown , she knew , her husband would stop on business . It was there she overtook him . The pony was small and the serving-boy who drove was small and smallest of all looked Star  --  gazing up at him demurelyfrom under mouse-coloured bangs . So the whole disobedienceseemed as small to the man as the participants . He laughed at her serious , questioning face and agreed that she might this time go to Paradise with him . Sometime she must , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was always Fenton who gave in  --  never his wife . Now the yellow chaise rolled before him , and he followed behind , like a mounted servant . Star was so little and quiet it had never occurred to the man that she was a tyrant . In some ways she was docile enough . She had given up her English Prayer-Book with never a qualm and accepted the Puritan beliefs . Surelyp349she would rather sleep any night ( even her wedding night ) than be kept awake by his ardour . But she was obedient to him and passive , like a good child who is doing as its elders bid . Emotionally , there was no response in that delicate , flat little body , but in another way she had responded quickly  --  as the prompt arrival of Anselm proved . Then she had no milk for the baby , which was fragile and fastidious as herself . Gravely , she summoned the wet nurses of Boston to her . And she called in not only the two ancient females ( for whom she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the New World ) but her husband as well . She had bought a book on midwifery and with this in her lap before her solemnly examined the nurses ' heavy breasts . One breast she found too flat , another lacked as long a nipple as the book recommended . And which did Major Parre ( for she never called him " Fenton " ) fancy ? He had other standards . He picked not by the book . The young wife of a poor lobster trapper blushed under his scrutiny . She understood , but Star did not . Little enough did Star understand , and yet in some way she bound her husband to her . A weak woman could not have done so . And never  --  not even after a year of marriage  --  hadhe fathomed her . She was still as unattainable to him as had been the fifteen-year-old child upon the Sea Queen . In his own way he loved her , and she him , but there was no understanding between them . So the yellow chaise rolled through the gaudy autumn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen of Paradise . It was late in the afternoon . She was cleaning rabbits , a. task distasteful top350her . She sat upon a stool by the hearth , an earthen crock beside her . Into this crock she flung lights and guts . She noted how like dead babies the rabbits looked once their paws and ears were off . The smell of the offal sickened her . She got up and stepped outside the door for a breath of purer air . How red and golden was the autumn world ! She stood with bloody hands and gazed about her , and she saw a smart yellow chaise whirl up to the front door . Estella Parre ( for she knew who it was ) looked minutely elegant with her muff in her hands , her cream-coloured pony , her little groom beside her , and her handsome husband riding behind . Bathsheba rolled down the sleeves of her dress . She would not return to her work today . Silently she slunk away to her own hut . The sight of Fenton 's wife filled her with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had noticed that the lady had come without her baby . Perhaps it was dead  --  dead and cleaned , with ears and paws cut off ( its offal in a red crock ) , ready for the spit . And who was this woman anyway ? Not his wife ! She was his wife . This was his leman , his doxy . And she cursed the innocent creature who had never seen her face . Most of the night she wept and moaned . Then at last she slept ; but woke again and again in anguish of fear and foreboding  --  gaspingand choking and crying out . Horrible dreams . . . that she could not quite remember . She had been pursuedby wolves , by dead men raised up from the buryinggroundback of the meeting-house . She pressed her hands to her aching head and could remember the gaping mouths of the dead in their winding-sheets  --  the lolling red tongues of the wolves . Fenton . . . when she had first seen him she had thought he looked like a wolf . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of her corn-shuck bed . She hardly was surep351where she was , for the horrors from which she had just escaped seemed more real to her than the familiar interior of her hut : the herbs , the boys ' old shoes , the wolf rug , the bear trap , the books , the old fishing tackle , a skull . A pain , as if from Hell , zigzagged through her head . She put her hands to her forehead , rocking back and forth and moaning in her agony . Then she remembered quite clearly . There had been eight dead , in their winding-sheets  --  far gone in decay  --  whizzing at her shrilly through the night . But was it a dream ? How could anyone tell surely what is dream and what reality ? Her nostrils twitched at the air . Yes , there was still about the hut a small smell of putrefaction . But of course that was the mutton Goody had let her take home . . . how long ago was it ? Friday or Saturday ? Last week or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ? And all weeks . Her mind fumbled back through time and found no solid fact to rest upon , and forward into time to come and found nothing . She was convinced there was no time . She sat and marvelled that man had ever thought to mark the days with hours and the hours with minutes and the years with months and the months with weeks . Difficult as time itself might be to cope with , one thing she did know . Goody had bade her come in time to the kitchen , for there was a sight of work to be done on husking day . That was why Fenton had come , and . . . that woman . In the fresh air she felt better . Her feet , as they touched the planks of the foot-bridge , felt like real feet  --  and her own ; and some of her dread dropped from her . And yet she knew . This was a fatal day . With some of her old confidence she entered the kitchen , where she was the last of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun , although the huskers would not come until afternoon . Goody Goad set her to the simple task of par- ing apples , and seizing a knife and speaking to no one , she squatted on a stool in the corner . An ox had been slaughtered for the occasion , and part of its carcass had been spitted and set to roast on the hearth . She watched the turnspit dog busy about his work . Women everywhere  --  rushing about , laughing . Jazan  --  ugh , she hated Jazan ! She picked up another apple . Jessie  --  her rough Scottish accent cut through her over-sensitive ears like a blade of grass cutting the finger . She could hear the tone of this unpleasant voice , but she did not make out the words . She picked up another apple . Phoebe  --  that great dray mare ! What was there about this heavy day to laugh and sweat about ? And little Hagar . . . Hagar despised her for her sin , let her confess never so diligently . And neighbour women : Dick Blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her sisterin-law , the malignant spinster , Judith . There was not one there she would deign to address . But her eyes fingered through the crowd craftily for the small face of Star . Not finding it , she felt a relief that was half regret . She drank in the marvellous smells of the cooking : the fat of the ox dripping into the fire , the pies baking , the spices being ground in the mill for the cooking and drinking . How many women were there in the room ? It seemed impossible to count them . Stealthily , she looked about for Star . An Indian woman ( she was not sure of her name but thought she was Clara-something ) was standing beside her . She alone showed marked interest in the distraught woman . She believed that such were holy folk and the words she might say holy words . Clara-Wood-Tree and the other Indians had known for a long time . . . . Now the squaw was offering her a hunk of raw bacon that Jazan had given her and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . She often went for over a day without eating , but when she did eat she had a ravenous appetite . After this she felt better and wished to talk to someone , but there was no one whose eyes she might catch except only this Indian 's . " Squaw , " she said . Clara put down the wild ducks she had brought up to sell to the Goodwife and squatted respectfully before this God-blessed woman . The white witch-man told them that God lived in the meeting-house  --  with the ammunition , the pews , and the Bible . She knew better . God lived in this woman . " Urn ? " she questioned admiringly . Bathsheba began , in the pretty flurried way that had suited her youth so well , but today , with her swollen face and tangled hair , seemed a very parody of female charm . " Clara  --  that is your name , is n't it ? Last night . .. I could n't sleep . And I went for a walk . I think I went for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It does help one so much to walk when one can not sleep , does n't it ? But in the midst of my walking , I was back in my bed again . " The old wrinkled woman watched her face attentively , tryinghere and there to grasp a word . " I was still taking a walk , for I can remember the trees whizzing past me  --  never stopping  --  and the swishing sound they made . And they were full of wolves , and I began to run . But I must have been in my bed all the time , for I remember waking up , and the first one came to me . I was so frightened I put my head under the bed-clothes and screamed . " " Good , " Clara encouraged politely . Bathsheba 's voice broke with laughter . She went on merrily . " They were all dead , Clara .. . they had no eyes and their limbs looked distorted and broken . So I began again to run . . . . " " Good . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all dead , all eight of them . Dead  --  you know the word , Clara ? " Clara pointed to the portions of the ox sizzling over the coals . " Him dead . " " Yes , he 's dead too . We 'll all be dead some time . " And she began to laugh . " Why do you laugh , Bathsheba ? " came Jazan 's voice from a long way off . " Why , " she cried , and sprang to her feet , letting apples , knife , and parings all fall to the floor , " we 'll all be dead so soon ! I never thought of that so clearly before . This house . . . " and she struck the summer beam where onions , herbs , and hams were hanging , " this board will last longer than any of us  --  longer than any child Fenton Parre shall beget on I do n't care how many harlots . And he really is my husband , and do n't any of you fools ever forget . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cattle-barn where men were hauling up the corn preparatory to the husking . She saw Gervase Blue standing by an ox team . " Gervase , Gervase . . . " she cried , as though she had most important news . " Well ? " " Tell your oxen . Tell them . . . . " " What shall I tell them ? " " Tell them they will die , and be spitted upon ash and roast in a fire hot as Hell  --  and find their graves in the stomachs of men ! " After this she walked daintily back to the kitchen and , with a sigh , took up her work.  |p355Jazan  , noticing the strange mood Bathsheba had been in all morning , had gone to Fenton and begged him to keep his wife out of the kitchen . She did not say that she feared the big knife the woman had in her hand . This had he done by saddlingTobey , whom he kept at Paradise , and taking his wife on a pillion to Swamp Town to amuse her . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians had not amused her much . She had no delight in strange things , but only in familiar . So they rode back . By the barn-yard he lifted her down and left her , as he led the horse inside . So Star stood , a remote and strange figure , outside the barn and watched with some intensity a hen and chickens picking up spilled grain . Neighbours were arriving , and they greeted each other jovially and looked a little curiously at the young lady standing alone outside the barn door . She stared at them but did not address them ; and they , guessing who she was , felt embarrassed , for they were as yet workfolk only . In spite of the son she had so recently borne , she still looked immature and virginal , but her face had grown wistful  --  like the face of a child looking out from behind the darkness of a pane . She wished she had not followed Fenton  --  wished she had not come . No one seemed to want her . If she had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had shed so many of since her bridal night , although Fenton did not know . A woman with haggard face and streaming orange hair was standing before her , breathing hard and staring at her . As God lives . The mark above her eyes ! So this was she  --  this was Bathsheba . Her throat contracted and she tried to think of something pleasant to say , but no words came . " You are not his wife , " said the strange apparition clearly . " And those children "  --  she pointed at Jake and Varney rolling in the corn fodder  --  " those are not Salome 's children  --  but mine . He is mine , and they are mine , and some time he will come to me . And we will all live together at Founder 's House  --  like wolves in their den . . . ha , ha . . . . " Fenton came out of the barn . He was moving very quietly but a little stiffly  --  as a dog moves approaching a stranger dog , on guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look of caution and expectancy in his dark eyes . " Oh , Fenton Parre , " she called to him , " there 's no need for it ! I can see through your shirt . I can see the hair bristling up between your shoulders . Put down your hackles and wag your tail  --  you wolf ! " She turned , lurched a little , then walked steadily back to the kitchen  --  humming , her head held high . She and Goody Goad were the only ones of the household who did not go to the barn that afternoon but stayed in the kitchen to see to the last preparations of the feast . Goody chatted , but Bathsheba said no more than monosyllables . At last the huskers came in for their repast . Three tables had been set up in the hall for the gentry , but the common people ate in the kitchen , where Bathsheba sat listless in her corner . Mr. Fearing pronounced the blessing . Faugh ! Today Bathshebahated him for a whitened sepulchre ! Drinking and eatingbegan about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ munching of food and snatches of harvest song . Her head had been humming all day , but now this music seemed to increase . To drown it out , she too was humming . She could hardly hear the voices , songs , and the laughter through this infernal music which rose and fell in waves within her . But she looked at the roasts of meat , the pies , the jacks and flagons of drink , the great heaps of food , and thought proudly , " This is a great house I belong to . " Dick Blue had recently brought home with him a wife  --  a poor young widow whom he had married almost beside herp357husband 's grave , in the wilds of Maine . No one thought Dick had done well by himself . The young wife was always weeping for the first husband and had little thought for the new . As she seemed to think herself nobody , the village was ready to agree with her . Her husband had told her that because Christopherhad married his sister , she would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but she had been afraid to put herself forward , and after a silent tiff between them , he had left her in the kitchen and himself gone into the hall . But this self-effacing woman had pity for others , and her mother had told her whenever she herself was in distress to look about her for someone even more unfortunate . She looked about and saw Bathsheba , whose strange story she had heard . Like the rest of the village , she hardly knew how to address her . " Dame Sheba " the vulgar called her . The Court of Assistantshad pronounced her to be " the Widow Bliss . " This title never was used . Yet the sad goodwife knew this was correct . After some hesitation , she said timidly : " Do you not find the beef very succulent , Widow Bliss ? " Bathsheba looked up at her in amazement . " Bliss ? No one calls me Bliss . ' You mistake yourself , my girl . I am Mistress Parre . " " Oh ! I am sure I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well all day . You did call me Bliss , ' did n't you ? " " I only asked you if the beef was not succulent . . . . I meant no offence . " " Oh , but you did call me Bliss '  --  I can read it in your lying eyes . Everyone has conspired against me , " she sobbed . " Everyonehates me .... " She flung down her trencher and heedless of whose feet she stepped on pushed her way to the kitchen door . And there , by some mischance , stood Star . " You ! " she screamed in fury , and almost knocking her over in her haste , she rushed past her and started on a clumsy gallopthrough dark evening towards Quantog 's Woods . THE moon had risen and was shining brightly when she came back from Quantog 's Woods . She thought it later than it was . There were still sounds of merry-making from Paradise , and she heard the door open and the Ordes bidding good night . She was tired and wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foot-bridge and stood before her low door she was afraid . The vivid memory of the dead men and the wolves that had tormented her last night under this sagging old roof frightenedher . The moonlight fell thin but clear through the trees , and she heard foxes barking . She stood filled with foreboding . She dared not open that door and look within . Her heart raced and her breath whistled through her teeth . " Christ Jesus ! " she whispered hoarsely . " Christ Jesus . " What might not be waiting within to spring upon her . . . strangle her ? She put her hands over her face and wept , for she did not know where to turn . Suddenly she cried out in a heart-breaking voice to her mother , whom she had not seen for many years . It was only in earliest childhoodthat there had been love and understanding between them . The years of discord were forgotten . " Mother , mother ! " she cried in her extremity . She saw , at the little window , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could scarcely remember it . But even as she looked , itp359twisted with death . The eyes fell in . The next moment the face of the corpse was gone . Bathsheba , she said to herself , there is nothing to be afraid of . You must be a brave girl and walk straight in . Unconsciously , she mimicked the forgotten accents of her mother 's voice . But she lingered , perplexed . Looking about her , she saw in the moonlight a tall man standing midway upon the foot-bridge . His hat was pulled down over his face and his cloak muffled his jaws , as though he had a toothache . Fenton ! Could it be Fenton had come to her ? But the stranger was even taller and very thin . She felt a certain confidence , now she knew she was not alone with her spectres , and she called to the loiterer . " Kind stranger  --  if you be a stranger  --  ' t is so dark I can not see your face . The lock on my door has stuck so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help me with so much as a push ? " The man said nothing , but he came to her quickly and stood by her side . There was a queer animal smell about him . As he fumbled with the lock , she said how the wooden locks found hereabouts were apt to swell with wet weather . In London , iron locks were common . Even at this moment she wished the silent man to know that she was no ordinary country hen wife . She chatted to him because she hoped that he would tarry a moment  --  giveher a chance , before he was gone , to look about and see that all was well . The door under his hands flew open instantly . All was as she herself had left it that morning . She was so relieved she laughed light-heartedly . " Kind sir , whom have I to thank ? For I have not seen your face . " She stood within her door , and he stood without . Then he dropped the cloak from about his face . She saw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She sawp360brindled hair growing close about this muzzle but longer over the low forehead . She saw slit-like pupils contracting and expandingin the yellow eyes ; the red tongue curling towards her ; the flash of huge fangs ; the loose and slobbering leather lips . The body , even the hands , were those of a man  --  but the head was of a wolf . Scream after scream came to the huskers at Paradise ; a woman in utter agony , screaming as she ran . Men seized guns and axes ; and , having hunted much of the night and talked of wild cats and Indians , they came at last , at sunrise , upon Bathsheba . She was sitting stupidly under an elm-tree in a pasture . Her clothes were rent and her body scratched and bruised . At the sight of Fenton , who approached her with gentle words , a look of incredible horror came over her . She tried to run again , but Mercuricus English seized her . The face she turned on them was so apathetic , so mazed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being questioned as to what had befallen her , she told them that a wolf had come to her door  --  and it had looked like Fenton , only taller and thinner  --  andit had been dressed in men 's clothes . This wolf had bitten her thrice ; upon the calf , upon the wrist , and once " in the heart . " She told this story simply , as a commonplace occurrence . Immediately she began asking each of the men in turn if they had a wife and how many children , and then showed them the wounds . There was a round bite  --  not in the least like a wolf 's  --  upon her wrist and upon her calf . " And only to my husband , " she said with dignity , " may I show the wound upon my heart . " Fenton went to her . They all knew now that she was mad . He took her hand . " Dear heart , " he said , " I am not a wolf . " For she drew back in terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not , " she exclaimed , with something of her old brightness . " The wolf , as I said , was taller  --  even . " And she said she was now ready to walk with the men back to Paradise . But she could hardly stand , much less walk . The young smith and Jimmy Orde made a queen 's chair for her , and she sat thus enthroned , looking foolishly pleased with herself . " What a triumph , " she laughed , " to ride home in the arms of the two most likely bachelors in Canaan ! " She seemed to have forgotten that Jimmy had been married for four years . Once she whispered in his ear : " I did not wish to embarrass Fenton before his friends  --  but it was he . He was the wolf . " For a few days she was apathetic and slept much . In this interval Fenton and Star went back to Boston . Then her frenzy came on her again , and Mercuricus and his father forged chains for her . Everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own clothes . Forethought Fearing , as was his duty , went to the possessed woman and prayed with her . His wife was with him , and the pity he showed to poor Bathsheba touched her . First Forethoughtsent away the curious and idle who gathered all day about her hut , peeking in as they might at a captive bear . Then he spoke her name and put his hand gently upon her scarred forehead . " God give you peace , my sister , " he said : Instantly she stopped plucking at her clothes . " I do not know why , " he continued , " demons have entered into you , but I hope by prayer that we may cast them out . We must work together , you and I. " " I am , sir , chock-full of demons . " " Others have been before you , Bathsheba , and have escaped them . With God 's help , I hope this miracle can be worked in you. , , He did not shrink back because the poor woman was half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her soul , and to it he addressed himself . He told her simply of the demons our Lord had cast out  --  especially those who entered into the swine of Gadarene . Seeing that she listened with intelligence , he told her more . His father had cast the demon out of an old mariner  --  and he himself , once , from a young girl . Then she began to make incoherent noises which he believed were the voices of the devils in her ; and , laying aside his kindly manner , he spoke directly to them , cursing them in God 's name and bidding them back to Hell . After four days of this treatment , Bathsheba did recover and was unchained once more . So she worked a little more negligently at Paradise and spent more and more of her hours wandering about , picking herbs and gazing . Twice that winter her madness came over her , but each time she recovered again . People said that when mad she howled like a wolf and that she was able to take a wolf shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad deck of the canopiedbed . From floor to ceiling it stretched , from wall to wall . She had been married for two years and a little more . It was midsummer and the katydids were solemnly sawing their tiny fiddles . Crickets  --  this was the first night she had heard the crickets . Soon fall would come . She heard Goneawaybark in a questioning way . He , only , remained of Fenton'sonce famous wolf-dogs . From the kitchen was a tiny scratching , a pounce , a squeak.  |p363Hi|psey  , the cat , was at work guarding Paradise from within  --  even as Gone-away guarded from without . A dog scratched himself , his leg thumping like a loom batten upon the kitchen floor . The turnspit dog . He slept by night in the kitchen , where he laboured by day . Not only had he been taught to turn spits but also to mount a little treadmill and churn butter . Goody Goad had had many ( first and last ) of these shortlegged , rheumy-eyed little beasts , but they all seemed much alike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and industriouswere they . She thought back through the years , measuring time not by human events but by the procession of animals that had come to Paradise ( and mostly gone ) . Motherly old Breeze , whom her father had always ridden . And he had liked the cats and their proud and offish ways  --  especially a torn called Malty  --  and had not cared for dogs . Gertrude . Fenton had shot Gertrude only last time he had ridden out from Boston . Jazan had seen his dark eyes brooding upon the woeful , half-blind , forlorn old bitch . He had taken a horse pistol from its holster upon his saddle and a spade from the shed . He had called Gertrude to follow him . Her hind legs dragged , but she wagged her tail at the sound and smell of her master . So they took their last walk to the top of Parre Hill  --  lovely , bare Parre Hill , a place of sunset and sunrise and far views . In time he had come back alone , cleaned his pistol , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if anything , had there been in his heart ? Doubtless not even Star might guess . And Valiant had died in the arms of a bear . And Sheepshead , in a death-fall set for wolves . Now there was only Gone-away . He had become fat with age , gluttony , and laziness . He was always hanging about thep364kitchen , begging for scraps , drinking up the milk set out for cats , and was suspected of sucking hens ' eggs . He took his home-guarding seriously , but no wolf fighter was he now . Horses , too . Goodness and Mercy . Those had been the names of the Galloway twins . She had learned to ride upon these ponies . Gone now . But Tobey still reigned , king of Paradise . He was a good sire and grandsire . His descendants were sprinkled over the Bay Colony , and in Plymouth and Rhode Island as well . Some had been shipped ( through Fayrweather and Parre ) to Jamaica . For the Bay Colony were the best horse-breeders in the new world . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston eight years ago , taking with him Agnes and Jazan . He was soberer in his ways , and his hide less dark and glittering . She stirred restlessly . Why , a person might lie awake many a night remembering only the beasts one had known . Beyond the partition she could hear Hagar and Forethought deep in whispering council . Hagar came thus to him , in his study , twice or thrice a week . These night vigils which he shared with his " sister " meant much to Forethought , for ever since Mr. Redbank 's death he had clung to her , but they irritatedhis wife . Never did she feel that there was any impropriety , but she guessed the women-servants  --  who , like Hagar , slept on the second floor and knew when it was the lady crept downstairs to consult the clergyman  --  sniggered over the matter . She felt ashamed that her husband could so comport himself , even in all innocence , as to arouse giggles among servants . Goody Goad did not cherish Hagar as she had when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had heard the old woman speak sharply to her that she did not keep to her bed by night but must go trailing down top365bother the minister . Hagar did not bother the minister . So , on and on , they whispered . The stair creaked . For a moment Jazan thought she heard a step upon it , and her heart paused . She thought one more person was awake this night  --  so full of the buzzing of insects and of man . Gervase Blue . He slept in the attic with the other men-servants . She guessed that , like herself , he often did not sleep well . Again and again , in the last two years , she had heard him come down the stairs and go outdoors . He always said ( if questioned next morning ) that he had tended a sick ewe or orphan foal . He had made sure a bar was up or the flax covered against possible rain . True enough . But Jazan guessed that if he had slept as tired working-men should sleep , he would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Often , for weeks on end , she would have no more word with him than good night and good morning . The sibilant whispering went on . Now it seemed louder than cricket or katydid . She wished to rap upon the wall and beg them be silent or speak out loud . She could not . Ah , well , soon enough it would be day . Soon enough the cocks would crow in another day . And what , then , of that ? It was in vain that she told herself that Hagar shared no part in her husband 's life that she would wish for herself . Jazan did not like the clever way in which he had reformed sinful old Canaan . It was this side of him and his pious meditations , which Jazan had come to dislike , that he shared with his sister-in-law . But what had she for herself ? She supposed that he loved her , but it was night love only and it had proved but little  --  not the child they both wished . Now she knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 26 , 167o ( cut , for all the world to read , upon Mr. Redbank's gravestone ) . . . because of that night , God would punish him and her . And he humbled himself to his punishment . Never was there to be a son to play Forethought to his Peter . She was to be a barren woman  --  shut off and alone , with no one to share her solitude . Fenton had two sons by now . Or rather , Star had two sons . For by the looks of the mousy , frail little things , Star had contrived them by herself without aid from Fenton . Agnes Fayrweather had four children  --  beautiful children  --  although Waitstill , her eldest son , was over-stout . Christopher had Jake and Varney , growing up away from him , at the mill . Their parents toiled patiently among the Indians of Gay Head and other remote places . Every spring had Salome borne and buried one more child . In outlandish spots had she buried these three dead babies . There was a long pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , probably they were discussing this barrenness of Jazan 's . Forethought was telling his satellite that he had done his part ( perhaps a degrading part ) , but his wife had failed him . No Forethought to his Peter . Now , did his dear sister think that perhaps , even after all these years , full church confession might not poultice the guilt ? And God would deign to fructify his wife ? The next morning she was told what the matter was that Fearing and his sister had discussed in such hissing whispers all the night before . Jazan thought it was because of Forethoughtthat Hagar was so tardy to start out on married life . But now it was settled this way . In the house which Fenton had promised to build for the couple there was to be one small chamber , and this was to be Forethought 's own room . When he wished to " withdraw from the world " ( the world ,  |p367to  Hagar , had always been Paradise ) he might hide himself away in this small " prayer-chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jazan , where he is . It is to be kept utterly secret , so no one can get at him  --  as they can here . " " I should think he would want a place where he could get away from his congregation , " said Jazan . Hagar pursed her pretty mouth . " Not entirely his congregation . But , of course , in a big house like this , there are always folk coming and going . I do n't think you realize how sometimesall this talk of cattle and swine and crops and money breaks in on his mood . And Phoebe . . . do you know , I 've seen her carry mops and buckets into his study when he wished to work ? No one here has ever considered the sanctity of his privacy . " " There has never been any privacy at Paradise for anyone . " " Do n't I know that ! And the soul does need a cell . . . . Abraham had the idea . Was n't it thoughtful of him ? He would feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever he feels the need . You wo n't tell anyone ? " " Not a soul . " But she wished he would arrange to take all the waiting congregation with him . She foresaw the patient waiters in the kitchen . What was she to tell them ? " Mr. Fearinghas gone to his cell . " It had a monkish sound . She shrugged her shoulders . Probably she would lie to them . And this , at Forethought 's command ! Abraham , the least likely of all the Blue boys , had been the only one to accept his father 's trade of miller . Goody Blue now realized that Paul and Dick had been utterly spoiled for the humdrum but respectable calling of their father by Fenton Parre , who had so early taught them that there was more money to be made by trading for furs . Hector had run awayp368to sea . Billy , having been apprenticed to a pewterer in Boston , had turned out no better . He had gone on to London with a silversmith , before his years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Very seriously did Abraham accept the responsibility of the mill . He was sober and steady , with no pastime except religious meditations . It seemed he could no more have been jealous of Hagar 's devotion to Mr. Fearing than her devotion to God . It was Hagar 's wish that her new home should be so small she might care for it entirely by herself . She did not want any servant to dilute the holy atmosphere . She had seen enough of servants and their low ways about Paradise . She bargained with Fenton Parre about the wedding contract , and in the end a curious document was drawn up . Paradisewas to supply all the staples of life , even to a " sober horse to ride upon " : so many apples ; so much cider and flour , English , Indian , and rye ; hams ; poultry ; beans ; bacon ; so much flax and wool , woven into cloth . She had fixed her life for herself so prettily there would be almost none of the usual household duties for herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be nothing for her to care for . So it was , with what looked to Canaan as almost poverty , she settled down to the most luxuriously idle life of any woman in town . She would never have to feed chicks or card wool ; never pick up an apple or make cider ; never direct servants and set them an example of industry . Even the milk was to be delivered daily at her door . Wealth was judged by big barns and great fields , the number of servants , the weight of the harvest . All these outer shows the little couple sternly set their backs to . They would have the quiet in which to cultivate their souls  --  not their lands . Into this peace , when he wished , the resident master of Paradise might escape.  |p369No  one had expected little Hagar to live long enough to be a bride , but at twenty she looked healthier than she ever had before . Although she still talked about preparing her soul for her real life ( which would not begin until after death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her in this vale of tears in her own way . Colonel Coffin registered their vows . In the evening there was a simple feast at Paradise , but it was a lugubrious affair . Christopher and Salome had not been invited to come up from Gay Head , and Hagar had written Fentonvery sharply that his presence was not wished . Besides the Blues and the household at Paradise , there were but few guests ; and these , uncomfortable and abashed . Certainly Hagar 's wedding was not to be , as she feared , " an excuse for swilling . " Bathsheba had come wandering in and , in her absent-minded way , eaten enough for three days and wandered out again , and come back and gone on eating as though she had just arrived . She was growing rather stout . Dick Blue 's nervous wife had made her usual unfortunate remarks and , as usual , in large words . And Priscilla Blue , who had been Agnes 's great girlhoodfriend , for some reason chose to sit about and look insulted . They drank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exhortation . Then a few of the discouraged-looking guests took lanterns and walked over to the new house with the bride and groom and sat about the kitchen awkwardly . Hagar excused herself and went to the chamber . When she returned she was dressed in that shroud which she had stitched seven years before . Wrapped from head to foot in the snowy grave linen , only her excited face and transparent hands unmuffled , she said in a breathy little whisper : " This is to symbolize for you all how , in the midst of life ,  |p370we  are in death . I stand before you , a bride of but a few hours . Surely one might think this the happiest day of my life  --  yet even so , I am shrouded with my own mortality . Abraham stands beside me . " ( She had taken him by the hand . ) " He is sad , and in black . ' T is only by fasting and prayer , and by setting aside the things of the world , that we hope to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord  --  Amen . " Forethought Fearing , who was as surprised as anyone at this dramatic entry of death into the bridal chamber , had not a word to say ; and even Jazan did not know whether his silence meant an approval too deep for words , or whether  --  being conventional and gentlemanly in his manners  --  he had misliked this parading of Hagar 's pious feelings . Soon the guests went away , nor did they return to them that night . The old custom which permits friends to break in on a new-wedded pair was not followed . No one was so bold . So no one saw them as he in his drawers and she in her shroud knelt by the bed-head and prayed for their souls . UPON a Sabbath Day late in the following January , Jazan , hooded and muffed in fur and wrapped warmly in a red cloak , walked slowly towards the meeting-house . She knew she was late , but she could not hurry . She was trying to compute the number of times she had heard her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two sermons every Sabbath . Then Thursday lecture . How much is three times fiftytwo ? One hundred and fifty-six . Or close to that . It was almost three years since Mr. Redbank 's death . So , let us say  --  three times one hundred and fifty-six . Her mind refused the task . She walked slowly , like a tardy child to school.  |p371The  Goose Common sparkled under white snow . Snow upon the roofs , lodged in the crotches of trees , creaking under foot . The sun was warm and dazzling . It was not for the short walk from Paradise to the Common that she had dressed so warmly . It was against the long cold hours within the unheated meetinghouse . She did not wish to enter , sit down , and freeze  --  her body on the outside and her soul within . She saw a knot of idle folk gathered about the stocks , which stood between the whipping-post and the town pound . Curiously , she stopped . Was this more of Forethought 's doing ? There was a rattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting-house , calling all to worship . The idlers quickly obeyed . As they moved aside , she saw who was in the stocks . It was Johnny Pigge . Johnny 's stout legs were held before her in a wooden vice , and she sat broadly upon the snowy ground . Her dirty black hair had tumbled about her shoulders . Her face , never delicate  --  evenin childhood  --  had coarsened . A very squaw she looked . Clinging close to her was Mercy , the only child of Johnny 's to outlive infancy . For white folk the little girl put on an expression of stupidity as instinctively as young opossumspretend death . Her unwinking , beady eyes stared at Jazan . " And why-for , Johnny , " Jazan asked , in sad compassion , " are you sitting thus ? " She heard a tithingman kicking a yelping dog out of meeting . The dogs were always following their masters to service . Mr. Redbank had never minded if a dog or two joined his congregation . Mr. Fearing minded much . " ' T is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore last week to Totonic . " She pushed aside her waddings of fur and old blankets and showed a new-born and still purplish babep372against her naked breast . Quickly she covered the child again , for although the winter 's day was sunny it was chill . " Co ! I knawed they would get me sooner or later . And you , Jazan , get ' ee to that mittin ' - house youn'er  --  or ' ee 'll be fined for absenting ' eeself from mittin ' . " " Let them do as they please . " She heard the great doors slam shut , the creak of the bolts . She was shut out  --  shut out from her husband and from God  --  alone in the wintry sunshine with the renegade white woman . She heard the nickering of goats about the inn . She heard the frosty chirping of chickadees . Then the heavy marching of the opening psalm . Mercy still watched her with malignant , reptilian eyes . " It was a month ago , Jazan , that the Town Fathers found out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Zwamp Town , and they had frightened Pa so that he did confessed . And there was nosing I could do , and I confessed . Specially as your man spoke so very soft  --  and sly  --  now do I see . I thought they meant no grief . And Totonic , he thought so , too . But ' t was only for the birth of my babe they waited . Then they pounced ! Zeems I never was married to Totonic . Moon Goes  --  she 's his wife . The cheeldren I have borne to my husband are bastards . And ' t is like I 'll be sent away from Zwamp Town . " Her voice broke with rage . " ' T is naught of their concern . We 're no praying Indians . I have been a fitty wife to Totonic . What right have they to come atwixt man and wife ? I have never looked to another man since I married my Indian . Your father . . . he would have known how fitty was the life I led . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flung out her arms toward the tallest slate stone in the graveyardbeside the meeting-house , " never did I know while you lived how foreright a man you war . And after you have comep373chuckleheads and hollow-pots . And that  --  for your so-called godliness ! " And she thumbed her nose at the meeting-house . " Oh , hush yourself , Johnny , " begged Jazan . " I promise you things will not be so bad . Where is Totonic ? " " He borrowed a horse from Gervase Blue and has rid away to Boston to see Fenton Parre . " But this did not fill Jazan with the confidence she might once have felt . In her mind she saw Totonic , a guest in Star 's house ( for it was Star 's and not Fenton 's ) . Could the miserablesmall savage get any welcome there ? And what could Fenton do ? So respectable had he become ! From within the clumsy clothes the babe began to whimper . When the woman tried to quiet it with her breast , she had no milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the baby . The child Mercy said nothing but stared at Jazan . " When did you last eat , yourself , Johnny ? " " Not since yester morn . And I am chacking with hunger and my hands are clum with cold . " " I 'll fetch you something from the inn . " " ' Twill do no good , darlin ' . My little Hoapestill is doomed to death . " Jazan touched the child 's head and murmured how pretty it was . She asked about its name . " Hoapestill his name is , for I still had hoape when he was bornded . Ay ! he 's a purty aptycock . I thought I had got away from them janzamy hyprocrites . Faugh ! I hate them . " When she seemed quieter , Jazan went to Orde 's kitchen . There was no one about the big warm room . Everyone was in meeting . She found milk and heated it over the embers in a skillet . She got bread and cut what pleased her . She took a handful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In theP374larder she set down the coins she had carried to meeting with her for the alms-basin . When she came back Moon Goes , knowing all would be in the meeting-house , had come to see Johnny . The two women were not talking , but so heavy was the understanding between them Jazan felt herself an intruder . Moon Goes was beautifullydressed in the heathen manner . She did not , like other Indians , wear cast-off white man 's raiment . Her soft doeskins were worked with porcupine quills . There were seams and lines on her face and grey upon her temples , but all Jazan saw was the beauty and great dignity the woman had . She saw the soft rich eyes , the quiet way she moved her hands , the grace of her body . At last she got to her feet and turned to go . Johnny was perturbed by her going . " Jazan , her says her 's agoin ' back to her own people . Her is goin ' to leave Totonic for me . Her believes that Totonic will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You know the Colony will never wittingly permit a white woman to live with an Indian . You are lucky to get off with a mere stock-sitting . " " Nor , they told me that 's but the beginning on the matter . I 'm to be haled to Cambridge and to Court . But now , Jazan , I beg that ' ee foller Moon Goes and persuade her not to think to return to her uncle 's village . " " But she could not go in winter . It is thirty miles from here to where Sagamore John makes winter quarters . How far could she get before the sun goes down ? " Johnny agreed that Moon Goes must be speaking of some future day . Ale-wife after ale-wife and swallow after swallow of hot milk Johnny ate . They did not know the time but feared the morning serviceP375might soon be over . It would be better when meeting let out Jazan should not be found beside the stocks . WEARILY , Jazan walked the snowy path to Paradise . Here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the dogs came gladly to meet her : Gone-away , a mastiff , and two hounds kept for hunting . Within the house was the turnspit dog , stretched close to the hearth . Hipsey , the cat , was curled in a chair with her new kittens . A sick lamb began to baa from its basket . These creatures now owned the house . She stood in the middle of the kitchen and looked about her . Rarely , in all her life , had she been alone at Paradise . The sooty pots and fat red crocks seemed almost ready to speak to her . A suet pudding bubbled in a cloth . Above the kitchen hearth were seven nails and upon the nails hung seven pewter porringers . The smallest was the size of a walnut shell , the largest no bigger than a child 's fist . These were used for measuring , but every child that came to Paradise thought they were toys . Whenever Jake and Varney ( the little ruffians ) came over from the mill , the first thing they wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would squabble over who got the smallest one ! Hams and strings of onions , ropes of dried apples , hands of seed-corn , hung from the blackened rafters . The pie press , the cheese cupboards , and shelves of glossy pewter and glittering copper and brass . . . . So this was Paradise ! Opening off the kitchen was the loom room , where the " great loom of Paradise " was set up . Sometimes an itinerant weaver was hired to weave more difficult webs . None such had ever left without saying it was the finest loom in the Bay Colony.
