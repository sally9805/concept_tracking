Like a well-spread buffet lunch , there was food for every thought in last week 's business figures . The stockmarket slipped badly one day , steadied the next , ended about on the same level ( 140.24 on the Dow-Jones industrial averages ) it had maintained for two weeks . Some thought this was a lull before a reaction , others declared it a pause while business caught up . Meanwhile , steel production rose again , reaching 39.8% of capacity , an eleven-point rise since prices were cut June 24 . Lumber production and wholesale food prices were also up . Freight loadings were off more than seasonally , as was power production . Wheat prices broke to new lows for the year and bank clearings slipped $700,000,000 from the previous week , were 14.6% under a year ago . <P> Last week there was confusion about the future and present , but none about the past . With a few meaty exceptions , semiannual statements showed that the U. S. had been buffeted indeed by Depression II .

Should income in the next six months keep this pace , the 1938 total of $61,000,000,000 will be only $8,000,000,000 less than 1937-a smaller drop than anticipated .
