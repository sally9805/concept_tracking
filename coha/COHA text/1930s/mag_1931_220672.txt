Seven columns wide the mammoth headline WILL GERMANY GO BANKRUPT stared London in the face one day last week . It spread across the entire front page of the MacDonald Government 's party organ the Daily Herald . Paradoxically this super-scarehead was a friendly gesture . Silver-haired , silver-tongued Scot MacDonald was welcoming that day the first German Chancellor to set foot in England since the War : Dr. Heinrich Brning , a young clean shaven statesman of but 46 , a Catholic of stern fiber who won the Iron Cross fighting fr Kaiser und fr Vaterland . <P> Dr. Brning came to London last week for the express purpose of persuading World public opinion that Germany faces bankruptcy and revolution unless her Reparations burden is reduced . Mr. MacDonald seemed ready to help-the British attitude being that such reduction is entirely up to the U. S. Under the friendly headline WILL GERMANY GO BANKRUPT Scot MacDonald 's hospitable Herald said : <P> " The possibilities of American co-operation in a joint revision of Reparations and War debts must be sounded . . . . Dare the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Dare the American banks and Government face the wrath of hundreds of thousands of small American investors who were persuaded to take up German securities ? Would n't the United States , rather than face this , cooperate in an attempt to save the situation ? " <P> Germans en Route . Young Chancellor Brning took with him to London his slightly older Foreign Minister , Dr. Julius Curtius , 54 , a by no means brilliant successor to the late , great Dr. Gustav Stresemann . <P> Dr. Curtius thoroughly bungled the Austro-German attempt to form a customs union ( TIME , March 30 et seq . ) . Dr. Curtius has yet to win a major diplomatic victory . He is a family man , devoted to his small children . Whenever he returns to Berlin from an official mission the crust of his formal reception at the railway station is punctured by their loud whoops . Studious and a hard , clear thinker , Husband Curtius has much that a Foreign Minister should have-has no genius . <P> With Bachelor Brning , Husband Curtius entered a sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both went to sleep . Whenever the train halted on its way to Hamburg crowds gathered to cheer the German Delegation , but the blinds of Drs . Brning &; Curtius remained drawn . They gave no sign of life whatsoever en route . <P> Arrived at Hamburg , the German Delegation went aboard the Hamburg-American liner Hamburg . Drs . Brning &; Curtius at once went up on the bridge . Playfully an officer took Chancellor Brning by the arm , saying : " It is a rule of the Hamburg-American Line that all passengers must sleep in their berths from two to four in the afternoon . " From two to four Bachelor Brning slept in his berth . Husband Curtius said he would sleep in a deck chair , cheated , was caught reading Shakespeare 's Macbeth . <P> Arrived off the Isle of Wight , the Hamburg transhipped the German Delegation onto the British destroyer Winchester which brought them with all honor to Southampton-honor particularly precious to a war-defeated nation .                @ @ @ @ @
