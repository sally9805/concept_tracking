( See front cover ) <P> Profound emotions aroused by the assassination of the President of the Republic ( see p. 21 ) , sent French voters to the polls last week in a mood of extraordinary and unwonted calm . There were no riots , no street fights , no arrests of individual malcontents such as disturbed the initial balloting fortnight ago for the Chamber of Deputies . But Frenchmen continued to think for themselves and to vote according to their thoughts . They were not stampeded toward the political Right by scare stories that beloved old President Doumer had been done to death by a " regular Bolshevik . " The second ballot took the same course as the first , a steady swing not to either extreme but from the Right Centre to Left Centre . <P> For a nation of Centrists , a moderate land of thrifty folk , this shift was sufficiently dramati Everyone agreed that it blasted and destroyed the power of the Right Centre coalition in the Chamber of Deputies whose leader is Premier Andr Tardieu , called " L'Americain " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of France , the nation shifted its attention from Paris-on-the-Seine 250 miles due south to Lyon-on-the-Rhone . Lyon presented a terrific sight . <P> A sudden landslide from the rain-soaked , earthen cliffs that tower above the Rhone had sent a heaving mass of mud hurtling down Caliure Hill where it burst like a tidal wave upon two apartment houses , shattering and engulfing them , ripping open water mains which spouted and gas mains which promptly burst into flame . A little further down the very street on which the two apartment houses had stood is the comfortable bourgeois home of Edouard Herriot , for 25 years Mayor of Lyon , Leader of the Radical-Socialist Party , outstanding French statesman of the Left Centre , and therefore apparently destined to succeed Right-Centreman Tardieu as Premier of France . <P> <P> The hour of the slide was 8:30 a. m . The nation was just about to vote . Mayor Herriot , of whom it is said " he could sell the Lyonese as slaves and they would make no objection , " had just finished his coffee &; croissant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trousers flapping , to the landslide . Five minutes later Fire Chief Rossignol ( Nightingale ) arrived and Lyonese firemen attacked the ruins , working furiously to rescue entrapped persons before there should be another slide . Like a commanding general Mayor Herriot backed off , took a perspective view of the hillside , conferred with city engineers who agreed with him that a cement earth-retaining wall was about to collapse . Mayor Herriot ordered Fire Chief Nightingale to sound a firemen 's retreat . <P> Disobedient and daring , the firemen refused to quit , though they knew that in Lyon 's 1930 autumn landslide 19 firemen were killed . Roared Mayor Herriot : " Get back ! Back all of you ! " When this had no effect , the burly Mayor rushed in and climbed to the top of the ruins , placed himself in the post of maximum danger , bellowed : " Do you all want to be killed ? Messieurs , I insist that you get back . "                 @ @ @ @
