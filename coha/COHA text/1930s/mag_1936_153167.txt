An aviation milestone was the announcement last week that American Airlines planned to sell equipment trust certificates to finance 60% of the cost of its 20 new Douglas planes . It was the first time that anyone ever considered planes suitable collateral for bonds , though equipment trust certificates backed by locomotive or hopper cars are an old story with railroads . <P> Buyer of the certificates will be Jesse Holman Jones 's RFC . Nevertheless , Mr. Jones is not noted for shoestring commitments . Douglas Sleepers cost more than $100,000 each , and after all 20 are delivered to American Airlines , Mr. Jones 's investment will be $1,250,000 . This sum will be paid off in installments within four years . <P> As in a railroad equipment trust , ownership of the air equipment will be vested in a trustee until the last installment is paid . On railroad rolling stock this ownership is revealed by a plaque with a legend like this : " New York Central Lines Equipment Trust of 1924 . Guaranty Trust Co. of N. Y. , trustee , owner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of the car , on a locomotive below the cab . On American Airlines equipment a plaque to the same effect will probably be attached to the fuselage under the wing .
