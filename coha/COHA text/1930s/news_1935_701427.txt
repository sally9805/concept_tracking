txt Protection for Tenants . The Legislature of this State is doing more and more to save tenants from the pitfalls of finely printed leases which are seldom read by tenants before they are signed . Section 231 of the Real Property Law was recently amended by the addition of a new Subdivision 3 which protects tenants against provisions in a lease pledging their personal property as security for the payment of rent . The new subdivision reads as follows : " Any lease or agreement hereafter executed for the letting or occupancy of real property or any portion thereof , to be used by the lessee as a residence ) which contains therein a provision pledging personal property exempt by law from levy and sale by virtue of an execution , as security for the payment of rent due or to become due thereunder , is void as to such provision . " LOUIS A. STONE . New York , Sept. 3 , 1935.
