Though 5,000.000 French workers , benefiting from cultured , straggle-haired Socialist Premier Blum 's new social laws , are enjoying a 40-hour working week , there was plenty of discontent in France last week . Hotel , restaurant and cafe workers , still waiting to be included in the 40-hour setup , staged a noisy demonstration to protest against employers who refuse to grant shorter working hours during the impending tourist season . To appease them the French Government had already been obliged to abolish the Droit de Tab-lier ( " Right of the Apron " ) , the " privilege " of waiters , hat-checkers , washroom attendants , doorkeepers to pay their employers for allowing them to work for tips . In some swank Paris cafs this has cost waiters as much as 100 francs ( $4.43 ) a week . Bricklayers , plumbers , plasterers were keeping the Premier jittery by stringing out construction of buildings for the Paris Exposition , because they fear unemployment when the job is finished . By last week construction on the Exposition was so delayed that the French Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the date originally set , but would now open on May 17 . Premier Blum 's political enemies received this news skeptically , felt that July was nearer the mark . <P> Angry building unions threatened to call a strike unless Premier Blum , who has pruned his budget down to a minimum , revises his finances , sets aside at least six billion francs ( $265,800,000 ) for a public works program . <P> In Premier Blum 's own party discontent smoldered last week . The extreme Leftists were still kicking against his non-intervention in Spain , muttered angrily when Le Havre 's Mayor Lon Mayer , during a meeting of the National Council of the Socialist Party , thundered : " We want no red flags , no Internationale , no clenched fists . " <P> This week on the eve of the new parliamentary session the furrows in Premier Blum 's brow grew deeper . So apprehensive was the Paris Bourse that Bank of France stocks dropped 585 francs ( $26 ) , nearly one-tenth of their value . Meantime 30,000 small storekeepers assembled angrily in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Caf-loungers and boulevard philosophers were less absorbed in Premier Blum 's political problems than in a treatise which he wrote 25 years ago , called Le Mariage , but which only lately crashed into the limelight . By last week these amateur reflections on the subject nearest to every Frenchman 's heart had run to a 20th edition . The book advises young men " to sow plenty of wild oats . " " not to love their wives too much when finally they marry . " Other Blum tenets for successful marriage are : " Do n't marry for love . . . . " Men should have sexual adventures , " otherwise married life soon will strike them as insipid and monotonous " though " it is better to choose love affairs before marriage than after . " Women are not ready for marriage before 30 because until then they are in " a polygamous state . " <P> With everybody in Paris smirking and chattering about his amorous outpourings , Premier Blum blushed crimson one night last week , moaned hopelessly : " I wish people would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
