txt lamation Act of 1902 was passed , providing for the irrigation of desert areas in the West . By this Act proceeds from the sale of public lands were set aside for the construction of dams and sluiceways to hold water and divert it as needed to the thirsty sands . Furthermore it arranged that the rents paid by water users should go into a reclamation fund to continue the good work forever . Construction was started immediately under the terms of the law . Within seventeen years about 1,600,000 acres had been reclaimed and more than a million were actually irrigated . In the single year 1918 , the crops of the irrigated districts were valued at approximately $100,000,000 . In his first message , also , Roosevelt urged the transfer of all control over national forests to trained men in the Bureau of Forestry ? a recommendation carried out in 1907 when the Forestry Service was created . In every direction progress was made in the administration of the national domain . The science of forestry was improved and public interest in the subject awakened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened to settlers . Water-power sites on the public domain were leased for a term of years to private companies instead of being sold outright . The area of the national forests was enlarged from fortythree million acres to one hundred and ninety-four million acres by presidential proclamation ? more than forty-three million acres being added in one year , 1907 . Men who turned sheep and cattle 1 o graze on the public lands were compelled to pay a fair rental in return for this privilege . Fire prevention work on a large scale was undertaken in the forests , reducing the appalling annual destruction of timber . Millions of acres of mineral land , such as i 1w government had been almost giving away to mining companies , , were withdrawn from sale . Lawsuits were started in the court against those who had obtained public lands by fraud and vast tracts were recovered for the government . An agitation was begun , which bore fruit under the administrations of Taft and Wilson , in favor of reserving to the federal government the ownership of coal , water power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to develop them under leases for a fixed period of years . The Prosecution of the Trusts . As an executive , President Roosevelt was a distinct " personality . " Discriminating between " good " and " bad " trusts he prosecuted some of the latter with much energy . On his initiative , the Northern Securities Company , formed to obtain control of certain great Western railways , was dissolved by order of the Supreme Court . Proceedings were instituted against the American Tobacco Company and the Standard Oil Company as monopolies conducted in violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Law . The Sugar Trust was found guilty of cheating the New York customs house and some of the minor officers were sent to prison . Frauds in the Post Office Department were uncovered and the offenders brought to book . In fact hardly a week passed without news of " wrongdoers " and " malefactors " being haled into federal courts . The Great Coal Strike . The Rooseveltian theory that the President could do anything for public welfare not forbidden by the Constitution and the laws was put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anthracite coal miners , which started in the summer , ran on late into the autumn , paralyzing industries and threatening cities with the menace of a winter without heat . Governors and mayors were powerless and appealed for aid . Although John Mitchell , leader of the miners , repeatedly urged conciliation , the mine owners rejected the demands of the men and refused to arbitrate the points in dispute . At length Roosevelt made up his mind that the situation was intolerable . He arranged to have the federal troops , if necessary , take possession of the mines and operat e them until the strike could be settled . He then invited the contestants to the White House and by dint of hard labor induced them to accept , as a substitute or compromise , arbitration by a commission which he appointed . Thus , by stepping outside t h e e Constitution and acting as the first citizen of the land , Roosevelt averted a crisis of great magnitude . The Election of 1904 . Inevitably the views and measures which he advocated with such gusto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were rumors of a movement among t hi+ Republicans to defeat his nomination in 1904 and it was said I hat . the " financial and corporation interests " were in arms against him . A prominent Republican paper in New York City accused him of . having " stolen Bryan 's thunder " by attacking great riches , harrying the trusts , and favoring labor unions . But when the Republican convention assembled in Chicago , the opposition melted away and Roosevelt was nominated by acclamation . This action brought a curious reversal in the tactics of Democratic leaders . They now denounced the President as erratic , dangerous , and radical and assumed the moderate role themselves . Turning from the Populistic Bryan , they selected as their candidate , Judge Alton B. Parker , of New York , a man who had repudiated free silver , and they made a direct appeal for conservative support . But public opinion was not so conservative as they thought . Judge Parker 's vote fell more than a million below that cast for Bryan in 1900 ; and of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sweeping the Republican sections , Roosevelt invaded Democratic territory , carrying the state of Missouri . With this vindication at the polls , his leadership in the party was so widely recognized that he virtually selected his successor . THE ADMINISTRATION OF PRESIDENT TAFT The Campaign of 1908 . Long before the close of his elective term , Roosevelt let it be known that he favored for the next President , William Howard Taft , of Ohio , his Secretary of War . To attain this goal he used every shred of his enormous influence and in the end won the nomination for Mr. Taft . Though the Republican party adopted a platform that was conservative in tone , Taft gave it a progressive tinge by expressing his personal belief in the popular election of United States Senators , an income tax , and other liberal measures . Roosevelt announced his faith in the Republican candidate and appealed to the country to elect him . Since Roosevelt had awakened so much interest in old Populistic doctrines , Bryan thought that the signs were favorable for a third attempt to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taught his party that victory did not lie in a conservative policy . With little difficulty , therefore , the veteran leader from Nebraska once more rallied the Democrats around his standard , won the nomination , and wrote a platform attacking the tariff , trusts , and monopolies . But for a third time Bryan was " snowed under , " though he polled almost a million and half more votes than did Parker in 1904 . Taft was victorious . Tariff Revision and Party Dissensions . At the very outset of his term , President Taft had to face the tariff issue which had been raised in the campaign . Moved by the Democratic demand for a drastic reduction in the rates , he had expressed an opinion implying that he approved a " downward revision . " Of this opinion Democrats made much and Republicans from the Middle West rejoiced in it . As a matter of fact pressure for tariff reform was coming from all sides . More than ten years had elapsed since the enactment of the Dingley bill , new industries had grown up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day for revision ? at best a thankless task ? had arrived . Without shirking , Taft faced the responsibility by calling Congress in a special session . Until the midsummer of 1909 , Republican Senators and Representatives wrangled among themselves over tariff schedules , and when on August 5 the Payne-Aldrich tariff bill became a law , a critical breach had been made in their ranks . Powerful Senators from the Middle West had delivered threatening speeches against many of the high rates imposed by the bill and a t the finish had broken away from their party to vote against it . The Income Tax Amendment . This rift in party harmony was widened by another serious difference of opinion . During the debate on the tariff bill , a concerted effort was made to include in it a clause laying a tax on incomes ? in spite of the decision of 1 lie Supreme Court in 1895 declaring such a tax unconstitutional . Conservative men , shocked by this proposal to ignore the solemn decree of that great tribunal , would not listen to the idea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon shifting at all costs some of the burden of taxation from consumers to the possessors of large incomes . The upshot was a compromise . For the moment the income tax bill was dropped ; but Congress passed the sixteenth amendment to the Constitul ion authorizing it to levy taxes on incomes ? later . A sufficient number of states ratified the amendment and early in 1913 it was proclaimed . // President Taft 's Policies . After the enactment of the tariff bill , Taft continued to push forward his legislative program . He recommended and Congress created a chain of postal savings banks in connection with the post office ? a scheme which had long been opposed by private savings banks . With his encouragement two years afterward , Congress defied the lobby of the express companies and supplemented the savings banks with a system of parcels post . Aware that the business methods of the federal government were not up-to-date , the President obtained from Congress an appropriation for an economy and efficiency commission charged with the duty of inquiring into wasteful practices and recommending improvements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favor of a national budget program to take the place of the hit-and-miss methods of spending money which had hitherto prevailed at Washington . Long an advocate of the peaceful settlement of controversies among nations , Taft now tried to realize his ideals . He negotiated with England and France general treaties providing for the arbitration of disputes which were " justiciable " in character even though they might involve questions of " vital interest and national honor . " But they were coldly received in the Senate and so amended that he abandoned them altogether . With greater determination he made an agreement with Canada providing mutual concessions in tariff rates and he drove it through Congress in the face of strong opposition from his own party . Having risked and produced a serious breach in Republican ranks , Taft was chagrined to see the whole scheme come to naught when its sponsors in Canada were overthrown in the elections of 1911 . Prosecution of the Trusts . To make matters worse the party echism was extended by what appeared to be the successful prosscution of several strong corporations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important cases , the Supreme Court ordered the dissolution of the Standard Oil Company and the American Tobacco Company on the ground that they violated the law . But in taking this step Chief Justice White was at some pains to state that the law did not apply to any corporations which did not " unduly " restrain trade . At once his remark was construed to mean that the Court would not interfere with trusts as such , and it became the subject of a popular outcry against the President and the judges . // Growing Dissensions . All in all , Taft 's administration from the first day had been marked by party discord . High words had passed over the tariff bill and they still rankled in the minds of disgruntled members of Congress . Differences over economic issues were complicated by strife between youth and old age . In the House of Representatives there developed a group of young " insurgent " Republicans , who rebelled against the dominance of the Speaker , Joseph G. Cannon , and other members of the " 01 ( 1 Guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conservative inclinations . In 1910 the insurgents went so far as to join with the Democrats in a movement to break the Speaker 's sway by ousting him from the rules committee and depriving him of the power to appoint its members . Since the rules committee really directed business in the House of Representatives , this was in effect an attack on the Republican " machine , " weakening the party from within . In the autumn of that year the Democrats won a clear majority in the House of Representatives and opened a drive on President Taft by demanding an immediate downward revision of the tariff ? a blow aimed at the industrial wing of the liepublican party . Rise of the Progressive Republicans . Not satisfied with t heir victory over Speaker Cannon , certain insurgents , calling themselves " Progressive Republicans , " started a movement to prevent Taft 's renomination . As early as January 21 , 1911 , they fort tl. ( l a Progressive Republican League at the home of Senator La Fol. lette of Wisconsin and launched an attack on the Taft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La Folic ' I ( ' urn " the logical Republican candidate " for President , and appealed to the whole party for support . Roosevelt in the Field . From a fray of this character Roosevelt could not abstain . Soon after his return in 1910 from a hunting trip in Africa and a tour in Europe , he delivered a series of addresses // in which he formulated a progressive program of his own . In a speech in Kansas , he favored regulation of the trusts , a graduated income tax bearing heavily on great fortunes , tariff revision schedule by schedule , conservation of natural resources , labor legislation , the direct primary , and the right of the voters to recall unsatisfactory officials . In an address before the Ohio state constitutional convention in February , 1912 , he indorsed the initiative and referendum and announced a doctrine known as the " recall of judicial decisions . " This was a novel and radical note in American politics . An ex-President of the United States proposed that the people be given the right to reverse at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any act of a state legislature passed in the interests of social welfare . Impressed by these addresses , the Progressive Republicans turned from La Follette to Roosevelt and induced him to come out himself as a candidate against Taft for the Republican nomination . The Split in the Republican Party . The country then witnessed the spectacle of former friends ? one of whom really put the other into office ? engaged in rivalry to secure a majority of the delegates to the Republican convention to be held at Chicago . When the convention assembled , about one-fourth of the seats were disputed by two sets of claimants . After the usual hearings the national committee settled the contests in such a way as to give Taft a safe majority of delegates . Unable to change this ruling , Roosevelt and his followers " bolted " the Republican party . Most of his supporters withdrew from the convention and the few who remained behind refused to answer the roll call . Undisturbed by this formidable revolt , the regular Republicans renominated President Taft and put forth a platform condemning many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Progressive Party . Roosevelt now declared that the Republican convention did not represent the voters of the party ; that any candidate named by it would be " the beneficiary of a successful fraud " ; and that it would be deeply discreditable to any man to accept the convention 's approval in such circumstances . Since this opinion was widely held among his followers , a call was sent forth for a " Progressive " convention to be held in Chicago on August 5 . When this conference assembled it had the appearance of a civic mass meeting rather than that of a typical collection of politicians . Women delegates were prominent , while the regular " war horses " of politics were notably absent . Cheered as a conquering hero , Roosevelt made an impassioned speech setting forth his " confession of political faith . " He was nominated by acclamation and Governor 1-Uram Johnson of California was selected as his companion candidate for Vice President . With a great flourish of trumpets the convention adopted a platform indorsing such striking reforms as woman suffrage , direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular election of United States Senators , and the short ballot . It also favored a program of social legislation , including minimum wages for women and the prohibition of child labor . It approved the regulation , rather than the dissolution , of the trusts . Like the fiery apostles of a lofty cause , the Progressives entered upon the campaign for the election of their distinguished leader . Woodrow Wilson and the Election of 1912 . With the Republicans divided , victory loomed up as a possibility before the Democrats and a terrific contest over the nomination occurred at their convention in Baltimore . Champ Clark , Speaker of the House of Representatives , and Governor Woodrow Wilson , of New Jersey , were the favorites . After tossing to and fro for seven long , hot days , and taking forty-six ballots , the delegates , under the still potent sway of Bryan , finally gave the honor to the Governor . As a professor , a writer on historical and political subjects , and the president of Princeton University , Wilson laid become well known among educators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attracted the support of progressives in both parties and become a figure in national life . With grim determination he had " waged war on the bosses " and pushed through the legislature measures establishing direct primaries , regulating public utilities , and creating a system of workmen 's compensation . During the presidential campaign , Governor Wilson toured the country and aroused immense enthusiasm by a series of critical addresses , later published under the title of The New Freedom . Like Roosevelt he attacked " malefactors of // great wealth " and declared that " the government of the United States is at present the foster child of the special interests . " He proposed to free the country by breaking the dominance of " the big bankers , the big manufacturers , the big masters of commerce , the heads of railroad corporations and of steamship corporations . " In the election Governor Wilson easily secured a majority of the electoral votes , and his party , besides retaining possession of the House of Representatives , captured the Senate as well . But his popular vote was far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total exceeded it by 1,300,000 . In addition the Socialists , with Eugene V. Dells as their candidate again , polled about 900,000 votes ? more than double the number received four years before . Thus , as the result of factional fights , the Republicans , after holding the office of President for sixteen years , lost control over the federal government , and power passed to the Democrats under the direction of a man destined to be another outstanding personality of the modern age ?

Attacks on Abuses in American Life . The Progressive uprising just described was not a sudden and unexpected crisis . It came as the climax to a revolt against corruption in politics which produced the Liberal Republican outbreak in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , followed by continuous criticism of political and economic affairs . From 1870 until his death in 1892 , George William Curtis , president of the Civil Service Reform Association , kept up a running fire upon the evils of the spoils system . In a book called The American Commonwealth , published in 1888 , James Bryce , an English student of politics , gave the whole country a shock by his picture of the corrupt " rings " and " machines " which dominated the cities of the United States . Six years later Henry D. Lloyd , a Chicago journalist , in a volume entitled Wealth against Commonwealth , attacked in scathing language certain trusts which had destroyed cornpetitors and bribed public officials . In 1903 Ida Tarbell , a writer of history , gave to the public an account of the ruthless methods of he Standard Oil Company in crushing its rivals . About the same time another journalist , Lincoln Steffens , exposed the sordid character of politics in several municipalities in a series of articles Hearing the painful heading : The Shame of the Cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekly and monthly magazines , in essays , pamphlets , editorials , and news stories , in novels such as Churchill 's Coniston and Sinclair 's The Jungle . It became so violent and so wanton that the opening years of the t wentieth century were well named " the age of the muckrakers . " The Subjects of the Criticism . In this outburst of invective , nothing was spared . It was charged that each of the great political parties had fallen into the hands of professional politicians who cared nothing for the public welfare but devoted their time to managing conventions , making platforms , and nominating candidates , just to wring money out of the game . It was alleged that mayors and councils had actually sold street-railway and other franchises to private companies . It was asserted that many powerful labor unions owed their gains to leaders who blackmailed employers . Some critics specialized in descriptions of the poverty , slums , and misery of the cities . Others took up " frenzied finance " and accused financiers of selling worthless stocks and bonds to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millionaires the downfall of the republic ? democracy giving way to an aristocracy of wealth . The Attack on " Invisible Government . " The burden of all this criticism was that the control of public affairs had passed from the people to an " invisible government . " So eminent and conservative a statesman as the Hon. Elihu Root lent the weight of his name to such a view . Speaking of his native state , New York , he said in 1915 : " What is the government of this state ? - What has it been during the forty years of my acquaintance with it ? The government of the Constitution ? Oh , no ; not half the tine ? or half way . . . . From the days of Fenton and Conkling and Arthur and Cornell and Platt , from the days of David B. hill down to the present time , the government of the state has presented two different lines of activity : one , of the constitutional and statutory officers of the state and the other of the party leaders ; they call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't coin the phrase ? the system they call invisible government . ' For I do n't know how many years Mr. Conkling was t I n supreme ruler in this state . The governor did not count , 11 legislature did not count , comptrollers and secretaries of st a It . and what not did not count . It was what Mr. Conkling said , a n in a great outburst of public rage he was pulled down . Then Al r . Platt ruled the state ; for nigh upon twenty years he ruled it . It was not the governor ; it was not the legislature ; it was Mr. Platt , And the capital was not here in Albany ; it was at 49 Broadway ; Mr. Platt and his lieutenants . It makes no difference what name // you give , whether you call it Fenton or Conkling or Cornell or Arthur or Platt or by the names of men now living . The ruler of the state during the greater part of the forty years of my acquaintance with the state government has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . The party leader is elected by no one , accountable to no one , bound by no oath of office , removable by no one . " The Nation Aroused . But with this critical mood came also the spirit of reform . The charges were often exaggerated , if not positively false ; but there was on the whole enough truth in them to demand the remedying of many abuses . Roosevelt doubtless summed up the sentiment of the large majority of citizens when he declared in 1907 t hat all the wrongdoers should he punished , and added : " It makes not a particle of difference whether these crimes are committed by a capitalist or by a laborer , by a leading banker or manufacturer or railroad man or by a leading representative of a labor union . Swindling in stocks , corrupting legislatures , making fortunes by the inflation of securities , by wrecking railroads , by destroying competitors through rebates ? these forms of wrongdoing in the capitalist are far more infamous than any ordinary form of embezzlement or forgery . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " muckraking " and abolish the evils which had grown up . POLITICAL REFORMS The Public Service . On no issue , perhaps , were reformers more thoroughly united than that of reducing the evils of the , poils system . And after fifty years of agitation they won a great victory in the federal Civil Service Act of 1883 , establishing five vital principles in law : ( 1 ) government officials must be chosen , not on the recommendation of party workers , but on the basis of competitive examinations testing their qualifications ; ( 2 ) promotions are to be made for serving the government well rather than aiding a political party ; ( 3 ) government employees do not have to contribute to campaign funds ; ( 4 ) officers shall hold their positions during good behavior ; and ( 5 ) there shall be no dismissals merely for political reasons . The Civil Service Act itself In short it permitted the voter to express his own will in his own way . The first state to introduce it was Massachusetts . The year was 1888 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by nearly all the states in the Union . Then came experiments with a mechanical apparatus which kept the chief features of the Atistralian ballot and automatically counted the results . The good effect of the change in reducing the amount of cheating and bribery in elections was beyond all question . The Direct Primary . In connection with the general uprising against machine politics , came a war on the old method of nominating candidates by conventions . These time-honored party assemblies , which had originated in the days of Andrew Jackson , were now accused of being merely " gangs " of party workers living on the spoils system and taking orders from an inner circle or " ring " of bosses . The remedy offered in this case was again " more democracy , " namely , the abolition of the party convention and this adoption of the direct primary . Candidates were no longer to be chosen by secret conferences . Any member of a party was to be allowed to run for any office , to present his name to his party by securing signatures to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow partisans at a direct primary ? an election within the part y . In this movement Governor La Follette of Wisconsin was very active and his state was the first in the Union to adopt the direct primary for state-wide purposes . The idea spread , rapidly in the West , steadily if more slowly in the East . In nearly every sect ion the public grasped eagerly at this scheme for checking the power of " the bosses . " Governor Hughes pressed it upon the legislature of New York . State after state accepted it until by 1918 there were only four ? Rhode Island , Delaware , Connecticut , and New Mexico ? which had not bowed to the winds . Popular Election of Federal Senators . While the movement for direct primaries was still advancing , a demand for the popular election of Senators , like it in purpose and spirit , swept to complete success . The constitutional provision giving the state legislatures the right to elect Senators had worked out in practice in such a way as to vest the selection in secret party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caucuses there had been // many scandals , some direct proofs of brazen bribery and corruption , and dark hints also . The Senate was called by its critics " a millionaires ' club , " and it was looked upon as the " citadel of conservatism . " The prescription in this case was likewise " more democracy " ? direct election of Senators by popular vote . This reform was not a new idea . It had been proposed in Congress as early as 1826 . President Johnson , an ardent advocate , made it the subject of a special message in 1868 . Later it came up from time to time in congressional debates . At last , in 1893 , the year after the great Populist upheaval , the House of Representatives , by the requisite two-thirds vote , definitely provided for it in an amendment to the federal Constitution . Again and again the amendment passed the House ; but the Senate voted it down . Many of the ablest Senators spoke eloquently against it . Senator Hoar of Massachusetts , for example , declared that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great cities and masses of population " ; that it would " overthrow the whole scheme of the Senate and in the end the whole scheme of the national Constitution as designed and established by the framers of the Constitution and the people who adopted it . " Failing in the Senate , advocates of popular election made a rear assault through the states . They induced state legislatures to enact laws requiring the nomination of candidates for the Senate by the direct primary , and then they bound the legislatures to abide by the popular choice . Nevada took the lead in 1899. shortly afterward Oregon practically ordered its legislators to accept the nominee who received the highest popular vote ; and I he country witnessed the spectacle of a Republican legislature " electing " a Democrat to represent the state in the Senate at Washington . By 1910 three-fourths of the states had applied the direct primary in some form to the choice of Senators . Men - elected by that method began to pile up votes in the United States Senate , until in 1912 the two-thirds majority was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the popular election of Senators in all the states . It was so quickly ratified that it went into effect the following year . The Initiative and Referendum . While taking away from state legislatures their right to elect United States Senators , the reformers also attempted to restrain their lawmaking power because their acts were frequently contrary to the public interest . The proposal in this case was the introduction of a Swiss plan knee n as the initiative and referendum . The initiative permits any one to draw up a bill and , when he has got a certain number of voters to sign a petition favoring it , to compel its submission to the people at the polls . If the bill thus initiated receives a sufficient ma , jorit y , it becomes a law ? without going to the legislature at all . The referendum allows citizens who disapprove any act passed by the legislature to get up a petition against it and require a vote on it . in the same manner at the polls . These two practices constitute a form of " direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government to the people . " The Populists favored them in their platform of 1896 . Bryan , t wo years later , made them a part of his program , and in the same year South Dakota adopted them . In 1902 Oregon , after a strenuous campaign , added a direct legislation amendment to the state constitution . Within ten years all the Southwestern , Mountain , and Pacific states , except Texas and Wyoming , had followed t his example . To the east of the Mississippi , however , direct legislat met a chilly reception . By 1920 only five states in this section had accepted it : Maine , Massachusetts , Ohio , Michigan , and Mary . land , the last approving the referendum only . The Recall . Executive officers and judges , as well as legislat a rem , had come in for their share of criticism , and it was proposed tlmI they should in turn be subjected to a closer scrutiny by the puhlie , For this purpose a scheme known as the recall was advanced which permitted a certain percentage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signers , and compel any officer , at any time d11rin4 his term , to face at a new election the judgment of the people his conduct . This feature of direct government , tried out , ti in the city of Los Angeles , was extended to state-wide uses Oregon in 1908 . It failed , however , to capture popular imaginal i to the same degree as the initiative and referendum . At the end ten years ' agitation , only ten states , mainly in the West , h // adopted it for general purposes , and four of them did not apply it to the judges of the courts . It was nevertheless extensively advocated in cities and incorporated in hundreds of municipal laws and charters , giving voters larger control over mayors and other local officials . Direct government in all its forms was bitterly opposed by gentlemen of the old school of government . It was denounced by Senator Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts as " nothing less than a complete revolution in the fabric of our government and in the fundamental principles upon which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised to break down the representative principle and " undermine and overthrow the bulwarks of ordered liberty and individual freedom . " President Taft shared t his belief and spoke of direct government with similar scorn . Commission Government for Cities . The quest for better government led to more study of the management of cities as a eience . City government , Bryce had remarked , was the one . onspicuous failure in America . This sharp thrust , though resented I iv some Americans , was accepted as a proper warning by others , nd many remedies were offered by doctors of the body politic . ' Iiief among them was the idea of simplifying the city government o that the people could understand it and control it more effect irely . " Let us elect only a few men and make them clearly responsible for the city government ! " was the new cry in municipal reform . So , generally speaking , city councils were reduced in size ; one of the two houses , which several cities had adopted in imitation of the federal government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be held to account , he was given the power to appoint nll the chief officials . This made the mayor , in some cases , the only elective city executive and wholly responsible for the local d ministration . A further step in municipal reform was taken in Galveston , Texas , after a devastating storm had laid waste the city in 1901 , and raised difficult questions of reconstruction to be solved . Confronted by a real crisis the citizens decided that they needed x more businesslike management of city affairs in the future . Consequently they abolished the mayor and council scheme and 570 Progressive Democracy and li oreign Relations vested all power in five commissioners , one of whom was assigned to the office of " mayor president . " In 1908 , the commission ftirlq of government , as this plan was soon named , was adopted by Des Moines , Iowa . The attention of all municipal reforlriels wlul drawn to it and it was hailed as the guarantee of a better city administration in every respect . By 1920 , more than four hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newark , had accepted commission government . The City-Manager Plan . A few years ' experience with Olio form of government naturally revealed its defects . Like the old type of officials , the commissioners often did not have the technical ability required to direct such matters as fire and police protection , public health , public works , and public utilities . Someone then proposed to carry over into city government an idea from t he business world , where the stockholders of each corporation elect the directors , and the directors in turn choose a business manager to conduct the affairs of the company . It was suggested that , t 1w city commissioners , instead of attempting to supervise the details of the administration , should select a competent manager to take over this work . A scheme of this kind was put into effect in Sumter , South Carolina , in 1913 . Like the commission plan , the citymanager plan became popular . Within eight years more than one hundred and fifty towns and cities had turned to it for relief . Among the larger municipalities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Phoenix . Later Cleveland and Cincinnati joined the list . MEASURES OF ECONOMIC REFORM The Goal of American Reform . Honest elections , direct government , and expert civil service were not the sole answers made by reformers to the critics of American institutions . Nor were they the most important . In fact they were regarded not as ends in themselves , but as means to serve a larger purpose ? the promotion of " general welfare . " The concrete objects covered by that broad term were many and varied ; but they included prevention of unfair charges by railway and other corporations , protection of public health , the extension of education , improvement of living conditions in the cities , elimination of undeserved poverty , removal of gross inequalities in wealth , and more equality of opportunity . All these things involved the use of the powers of government . Although a few citizens clung to the earlier doctrine that the government should not interfere with private business at all , the , American people rejected that conservative theory as impatiently as they rejected the that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisted Roosevelt , " the laissez-faire theory of political economy and fearlessly champion a system of increased governmental control , paying no attention to the cries of worthy people who denounce this as socialistic . " This conviction was affirmed by Taft when he said : " Undoubtedly the government can wisely do much more . . . to relieve the oppressed , to create greater equality of opportunity , to make reasonable terms for labor in employment , and to furnish vocational education . " But he was quicker to add a word of caution that " there is a line beyond which the government can not go with any good practical results in seeking to make amen and society better . " The Regulation of Railways . The first attempts to use the government in a large way to control private enterprise in the public interest were made by the Northwestern states between 1871 ) and 1880 . Charges were circulated by the farmers , particularly those belonging to Granges , to the effect that the railways extorted the highest possible rates for freight and passengers , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fraudulent stocks and bonds were sold to the public . It was claimed th:t t railways were not on the same footing as other enterprises , but were " quasi-public " concerns , like roads and ferries , and thus matters for government control . In response to such arguments laws were enacted subjecting railroads to state supervision . In some cases state legislatures fixed the maximum rates to be charged by common carriers , and in other cases commissions were created with the power to establish such rates after an investigation . Conservatives in the East frowned upon this legislation , and said that it amounted to a " confiscation " of the railways in the interest of the farmers . And some of the companies tried to induce the Supreme Court of the United States to declare it unconstitutional . The outcome was a kind of compromise . The Court said that the states could regulate rates but must allow railway companies to earn a " fair " return on the capital invested . In a few years the Granger spirit reached Congress . An investigation revealed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and travelers . The result was the act of 1887 which created the interstate commerce commission , forbade discriminations in rates , and prohibited other profiteering practices on the part of railways . For various reasons , this measure was not strictly enforced , so that the evils at which it was aimed continued almost unabated . Hence a demand for more effective control grew louder and louder until Congress was forced to heed . In 1903 it enacted the Elkins law , which forbade railways to charge rates other than those published , and provided punishments for // officers and agents of companies who granted secret favors to shippers , and for shippers who accepted them . A still more drastic step was taken in 1906 by the passage of the Hepburn Act which authorized the interstate commerce commission to receive complaints and , after a public hearing , to determine whether just and reasonable rates had been charged by any company . In short , the right to fix freight and passenger rates was thus taken from the 4 owners of the railways engaged in interstate commerce and vested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of f he Senate . In effect property worth $20,000,000,000 or more was declared to be a matter of public concern and subject to government regulation . Municipal Utilities . Similar issues were presented by the street railways , electric light plants , and other public utilities . In the beginning the right to construct such undertakings was freely , and often corruptly , granted to private companies by city councils . Many such concessions or " franchises " were made perpetual , or perhaps for a term of 999 years . Generally also the rates charged : Ind services rendered to the people were left to the will of the companies themselves . Mergers or unions of companies were common ; nd stocks and bonds of doubtful value were " unloaded " on the public ; bankruptcies were frequent . Furthermore the relations Between the utility companies and the politicians were , to say the cast , not always in the public interest . Three lines of progress leading , it was said , to better service rid more reasonable rates were marked out by the reformers . One Group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to require government approval for the formation I ' new utility companies and all issues of stocks and bonds . In , ome cases state , and in other cases municipal , commissions were created to exercise this great power over " quasi-public corpora- . I ions . " Wisconsin , by legislation enacted in 1907 , placed all heat , light , water works , telephone , and street railway companies under t lie supervision of a single commission . Other states followed this example rapidly . By 1920 the principle of public control over municipal utilities was accepted in nearly every section of the nation . A second line of reform appeared in the " model franchise f0 ! utility corporations , illustrated by the Chicago street railwa settlement'of 1906 . The total capital of the company was fix ( at a definite sum , its earnings were agreed upon , and the city wy given the right to buy and operate the system if it desired to di ) so , In many states , as a part of the general program , it was provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t well t y. five years , subject to renewal on precise terms . A third group of reformers were satisfied with nothing short of public ownership . They insisted that regulation failed to brink about fair rates and that utility companies were still corrupting politics , press , and schools . They proposed to drive private eoiupanies entirely out of the field and vest the ownership and m:umgement of plants in the city , the state , or the federal government according to the nature of the utility . This plan was extensively applied to municipal electric-light and water-works plants , and to street railways in a few cities , including San Francisco and Seattle . In New York the subways are owned by the city but , leased for operation . Congress provided in 1920 that water-power sites on the federal domain and navigable rivers should not Iw ? sold but should remain in the hands of the government even if tha right to use them was sometimes leased to private companies . Tenement-House Control . Among the most pressing prohl mM of the cities was overcrowding in houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made under the authority of the strata in 1902 , revealed poverty , misery , slums , dirt , and disease , un . suspected by well-to-do citizens . A tenement-house law was then enacted , prescribing in great detail the size of rooms , airspace , light and sinitary arrangements for all new buildings at least . An immense improvement followed and the idea was quickly taken up in other states having large industrial centers . In 1920 New York put a bridle on greedy landlords by assuring to the public " reason . able rents " for flats and apartments of certain grades . Workmen 's Compensation . No small part of the poverty in cities was due to the injury of wage-earners while working at t heir trades . Every year the number of men and women killed cM wounded in industry mounted higher . Under customary law , tie // workman or his family had to bear all the burden , unless the employer had been guilty of some extraordinary negligence , and even in that case an expensive lawsuit was usually necessary to recover " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and machinery against necessary risks from fire and . form , they allowed their employees to assume the heavy losses due to accidents to their bodies . It was generally believed up to this time that labor should endure all the brunt of mishaps . It was said to be unfair to make the employer pay for injuries for which he was not personally responsible ; but the argument was overborne . About 1910 there set in a decided movement in the direction of lifting the burden of accidents from the unfortunate victims . Laws were enacted requiring employers to pay damages in fixed amount s according to the nature of the case , no matter how the accident occurred , as long as the injured person was not guilty of willful negligence . By 1914 more than one-half the states had such laws and , to avoid losses , owners of dangerous machinery now began t o surround them with better safeguards . The next advance along this line took the form of , industrial insurance providing for automatic grants by state commissions to persons injured in industries  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employers or the state or by both . By 1917 thirty-six states had legislation of this type . Minimum Wages and Mothers ' Pensions . Another prime source of poverty was of course the low wages paid for labor in many cases . Report after report furnished the facts to prove it . While some of the labor unions were able to maintain high wage-scales by organized efforts , women and children were more defenseless in the labor market ; often the so-called " women " were merely young girls . In 1912 Massachusetts took a significant step in the direction of declaring the minimum wages which ought to be paid to women and children . Oregon , the following year , went further by creating a commission with power to fix minimum wages in certain industries , based on the cost of living , and to enforce the rates . Within a short time one-third of the states had legislation of this character , but its development was blocked in 1925 by ; e decision of the Supreme Court of the United States declaring void an Arizona minimum-wage law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by enabling poor widows to bring up their children in their own homes , " mothers ' pensions " next . became a popular measure of reform . At the opening of 1913 two states , Colorado and Illinois , had laws authorizing the payment from public funds of definite sums to widows with small children . Within four years , thirty-five states had similar legislation . From this it was but a step to pensions for all old persons unable to support themselves . By 1929 five states , Montana , Nevada , Wisconsin , Kentucky , and Illinois , had provided such pensions and the movement in favor of the principle was gaining rapid headway . // Taxation and Great Fortunes . As a part of the campaign waged against poverty the demand for taxes upon great fortunes grew stronger , particularly for taxes upon large inheritances . Roosevelt was an ardent champion of this type of taxation and dwelt upon it at length in his message to Congress in 1907 . " Such a tax , " he said , " would help to preserve a measurable equality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manhood . . . . Our aim is to recognize what Lincoln pointed out : the fact that there are some respects in which men are obviously not equal ; but also to insist that there should be equality of self-respect and of mutual respect , an equality of rights before the law , and at least an approximate equality in the conditions under which each man obtains the chance to show the stuff that is in him when compared with his fellows . " The spirit of the new politics was , therefore , one of reform , not of revolution . It called for no utopian experiments , but for the steady and progressive enactment of measures aimed at admitted abuses and designed to accomplish tangible results in the name of t he general welfare . Questions 1 . Who were some of the critics of American political practices ? 2 . What particular criticisms were advanced ? 3 . How did F.1ihu Root define " invisible government " ? 4 .

Questions for Debate 1 . The direct primary has been beneficial . 2 . The initiative and referendum have been justified in their results . Women in Public Life . The story of American politics and the spirit of reform is not the history of men 's activities alone . On the contrary much of the new legislation just described was directly promoted by organizations made up exclusively of women . In other cases it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were zealous participants . No cause escaped women 's attention ; no year passed without expanding the range of their labors . They served on committees that studied the problems of the day ; they appeared before legislative assemblies and congressional bodies to advocate remedies for evils they discovered . By 1912 they were a force to be reckoned with in national politics , as actual voters in a few states and as a " moral " influence in others . Nevertheless this advanced position had been attained only by slow stages from an almost rightless condition in the colonial era . Under the English common law generally applied in America at that time , unless there was a pre-wedding settlement arranging otherwise , a married woman 's personal property ? jewels , money , furniture , and the like ? became her husband 's property and her landed estate also passed to his control . Even the wages a woman or girl earned , when she worked outside the home , belonged to her husband or father respectively . In keeping with the law , custom of course dictated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into public discussions on religion or anything else of consequence . So it is indeed a far cry from the banishment of Anne Hutchinson from Massachusetts in 1637 for daring to dispute with the church fathers and local magistrates to the national political conventions of 1920 in which women sat as delegates , made nominating speeches , and served on committees . In the contrast between these two events may be measured the 579 Revolution in the privileges and position of women since the hour when the first Englishmen settled the New World . The account of this progress is a narrative of individual leadership by " rebellious " women who , after the style of masculine agitators , " condemned , assailed , and attacked " the opposition which in their case tried to bind them to one kind of life forever . It is also a narrative of organized campaigns of education by disciples of such pioneers and of aid from men in sympathy with efforts to remove civil and political disabilities from all Americans . To a large extent this progress is due to irresistible economic forces which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave them property rights , and brought more economic independence . What agitation demanded , industry helped to achieve . // THE RISE OF THE WOMAN MOVEMENT Protests of Colonial Women . Few significant reforms spring up full-armed in a single night . Even this republic did not arise that way . Independence was a product of gradual nurture by fireside discussions and debates in public forums , by reactions to episodes and English legislation . In similar fashion independence for women was matured . That colonial women shared in the domestic sifting of political principles and programs we know both from their own letters and from the correspondence of men . As for the making of public opinion , the force of their patriotism is indicated in the collections we have of their revolutionary writings for the newspapers , including songs , dramas , satirical " skits " on English rule , and special articles . Naturally therefore when everyone was arguing about the true basis of government and poring over Thomas Paine 's Common Sense , some of the colonial women were led to apply the notion of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on self-government all around . Thus did Abigail Adams , when her husband , John Adams , was in the Continental Congress at Philadelphia debating the future of America , for she wrote to him objecting " to all arbitrary power whether of state or males " and urging a " voice or representation " for women in the new state . Hannah Lee Corbin , sister of " Lighthorse " Harry Lee , likewise protested to her influential brother against taxation of either men or women without representation . The Stir among European Women . Such " feminism " in America was quickened by events in Europe . English women were especially aggrieved because men were entering their industries and in protest they held a conference in London at which they coupled with their economic complaints demands for better education and the right to vote . In 1792 this budding revolt against custom was voiced by Mary Wollstonecraft in her Vindication of the Rights of Women ? a book that was destined to serve women as the books of Locke and Paine had served men . Meanwhile French women were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizenness " ranked with " citizen " as a symbol of reform . This phase of French radicalism , like all its other phases , had a wide curve of influence which took in both hemispheres . Leadership in the United States . In assuming the task of securing civil and political rights , American women had to study and write books useful to their cause . To be sure a library of sermons already existed to emphasize the domestic duties of women but there was very little material available on their economic condition , their role in the great civilizations of the past , or the public aspects of the family they were asked to guard and serve . So books were now prepared to meet this need . For example , Mrs. Elizabeth Ellet wrote a history of the American Revolution which brought out the part women had played in the war for independence . Lydia Maria Child and Margaret Fuller published works dealing with women of other times and places and bringing the record up-to-date . Margaret Fuller called her study The ( are nt Lawsuit : or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Wollstonecraft was also read and discussed in this country as in England . The Struggle for Education . With criticism was carried on a struggle for better educational facilities , since women had been from the beginning excluded from every college in America . In this field Emma Willard and Mary Lyon were conspicuous pioneers ; the former founded a girls ' seminary at Troy , New York , which ventured to make higher mathematics a part of the regular course of study ; the latter started in Massachusetts a school which later became Mount Holyoke College . Sarah J. Hale , a prominent editor , waged a long and powerful campaign for equal educational opportunities , that went far toward paving the way for the founding of Vassar College , when the sectional war was over . Oberlin College in Ohio , established in 1833 , astonished the nation by admitting girl students and then contributed Lucy Stone , Antoinette Brown , and other capable leaders to help engineer t he movement for the extension of women 's rights . An education association was formed in 1852 to promote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , east and west across the country agitating for a recognition of that educational right , This was preceded in 1848 by the founding of the American Female Medical Education Society . // The Desire to Effect Reforms . As soon as they knew more of their peculiar history and their part in previous civilizations , women grew more confident of their right to express themselves freely in public about the controversies of their own age . When the " Daughters of Temperance " were organized in 1846 , they were so bold as to ask that habitual drunkenness be made a ground for divorce and they denounced the churches for indifference to excessive drinking . The slavery issue also called women into public life . The Grimkc sisters of South Carolina emancipated their bondmen , and one of these sisters , socially exiled from Charleston for her " Appeal to the Christian Women of the South , " went North to work against the slave system . In 1837 the National Women 's Anti-Slavery Convention met in New York with seventyone women delegates in attendance representing eight states . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costume , went as American representatives to the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London ? much to the horror of the majority of male delegates , who promptly excluded them from the sessions on the ground that it was not proper for women to take part in such assemblies . But this action only stiffened the backs of the women . Nothing human did they consider alien to them . They worked against cruel criminal laws and indecent prisons . They organized poor relief and led in private philanthropy . Dorothea Dix directed the movement that induced the New York legislature to establish in 1845 a separate asylum for the criminal insane . In the same year Sarah G. Bagley organized the Lowell Female Reform Association for the purpose of reducing the long hours of labor for women , safeguarding " the constitutions of future generations . " Mrs. Eliza Woodson Farnham , matron in Sing Sing penitentiary , was known throughout the nation for her social work , especially prison reform . Wherever there were misery and suffering , women appeared with programs for relief . Freedom of Speech for Women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make public appeals and take part in open meetings . Though contrary to the general custom which forbade " ladies " to leave " the sheltered seclusion of the home , " women insisted on making their voices heard in the fermenting intellectual life of the age . Frances Wright , who came to the United States from Great Britain in 1820 , lectured all over the country for nr:rny years on labor , feminism , and politics . A Polish orator , Ernest inf . Rose , fleeing from oppression , spoke to crowded houses in all t h e large cities on " the science of government . " Besides wielding her pen skillfully , Margaret Fuller gave " parlor conversations " on art , science , religion , politics , literature , philosophy , and society , exhibiting a range of interests much like Emerson 's . While some of these " new women " were cordially received , others were persecuted and mobbed . Antoinette Brown , although slip had credentials as a delegate , was driven off the platform of a temperance convention in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain hospitable as the women grew more independent and assertive . James Russell Lowell , editor of the Atlantic Monthly , declined a poem from Julia Ward Howe on the theory that no woman could write a poem ; but he added on second thought that he might consider an article in prose . Nathaniel Hawthorne , another editor , even objected to something in prose because to him " all ink-stained women were equally detestable . " To the natural resentment against their intrusion into fields dominated by men was joined a dislike for women 's ideas and persistence . As temperance reformers , they were apt to be merciless toward those who would not accept their opinions . As opponents of slavery , they seemed neither to sleep nor to rest . One of their conventions , held at Philadelphia in 1833 , passed a resolution calling on all women to leave those churches that would not condemn every form of human bondage . This brought down upon them the enmity of many preachers who were accustomed to women 's sitting silent in the churches and who were scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Puritan clergy of Anne Hutchinson 's day . Women next decided that they would preach themselves ? out of the pulpit first and finally in it . Women in Industry . The period of this mental upheaval was also the age of the industrial revolution and the growth of mill towns in America . Women 's work was now in extraordinary measure transferred from homes to factories . And if the slavery // system raised social questions , so did the factory system . Among these were hours of labor , sanitary conditions , the competition of foreign immigrants with native labor , comparative wages of men and women , and the right of women to their earnings . Moreover these problems were complicated by the constant shifting of men into women 's hereditary occupations , such as the needle trades , and by women 's invasion of men 's industries ? boot and shoe making , for instance . To deal with the new conditions women in some of the trades formed unions of their own and strikes occasionally occurred . The mill girls of Lowell , Massachusetts , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , published a magazine , The Lowell Offering , which contained such excellent poems and articles that the French statesman , Thiers , is said to have carried a copy of it into the Chamber of Deputies to show what working women could achieve in a republic . Winning their way in the world outside the home and the old type of family care , women began to talk of their " economic independence . " Another European Revolution Awakens Echoes in America . Such was the quickening of women 's minds in 1848 when the world was startled once more by a revolution in France which spread to Germany , Poland , Austria , Hungary , and Italy . Again the people of the Western nations began to examine the principles of democracy and to argue human rights . In these European agitations and uprisings women were active as usual . From their prison in France two , who had been jailed for their disturbances over women 's rights , exchanged greetings with American women who were raising the same issue here . The Women 's Rights Convention of 1848 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European revolution moral and intellectual forces crystallized in the first Women 's Rights Convention in the history of America . It met at Seneca Falls , New York , in 1848 , on the call of Lucretia Mott , Jane Hunt , Martha Wright , Elizabeth Cady Stanton , and Mary Ann M'Clintock , three of whom were Quakers . Accustomed to equality with men in their religious meetings , the Quakers suggested that men be invited to attend the convention . Indeed a man presided , for the other advocates of rights for women still felt that " chairing " was too exalted a performance to try as yet . From this Seneca Falls convention was sent forth a Declaration of Rights modeled after the Declaration of Independence . The preamble began : " When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one portion of the family of man to assume among the people of the earth a position different from that which they have hitherto occupied . . . . " So also it closed : " Such has been the patient suffering of women under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to demand the equal station to which they are entitled . " Included in the text was a list of grievances , the exact number which had been handed to George I I in 1776 . Especially did these women scoff at the disabilities imposed upon them by the English common law imported into America ? the law which denied married women their property , their wages , and their own legal existence . All these grievances they recited to " a candid world . " Then they set down in detail their remedies : equal rights in the colleges , trades , and professions ; equal suffrage ; the right to share in all political offices , honors , and emoluments ; the right to complete equality in marriage , including equal guardianship of children ; and for married women the right to own property , to keep their wages , to make contracts , to transact business , and to testify in the courts of justice . In short , they declared women to be legal " persons " as men are persons and entitled to all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clarion call for justice in 1848 ? to an amused and contemptuous country , it must be admitted  - -  but to a country fated to heed and obey . The First Gains in Civil Liberty . The women 's rights convention did not make the suffrage its leading demand . It looked first to the winning of civil rights , and the New York Legislature of that very year , as a result of a twelve years ' agitation , passed the Married Woman 's Property Act giving them many of the " rights of man . " California and Wisconsin followed in 1851 ) ; Massachusetts in 1854 ; and Kansas in 1859 . Other states soon fell into line . Women 's earnings and inheritances were at last theirs , in some parts of America at least . In a little while laws // were passed granting women rights as equal guardians of their children and permitting them to divorce their husbands on grounds of cruelty and drunkenness . By degrees more steps were taken . The Women 's Medical College of Pennsylvania was founded in 1850 , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleges soon emulated the example of Oberlin in co-education : the University of Utah in 1850 ; Hillsdale College in Michigan in 1855 ; Baker University in Kansas in 1858 ; and the University of Iowa in 1860 . New trades and professions were opened to women and traditional prejudices against their activities and demands slowly gave way to concepts more befitting the modern era . THE NATIONAL S'T'RUGGLE FOR WOMAN SUFFRAGE The Beginnings of Organization . As women surmounted one obstacle after another in the path of civil equality , the agitation for equal suffrage came to the front . If any year is to be fixed as the date for emphasis , it may very well be 1850 , when the suffragists of Ohio urged the state constitutional convention to confer the vote upon them , when state suffrage conferences were held in Indiana , Pennsylvania , and Massachusetts , and when the leaders of these meetings began to cooperate . The same year the first national suffrage convention was held in Worcester , Massachusetts , on the call of eighty-nine prominent men and women representing ix states . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nited States and in Europe . English women ? for instance , I larriet Martineau ? sent words of appreciation for the work thus inaugurated . It inspired a leading article in the Westminster li'eview which caught the attention of the distinguished economist , John Stuart Mill , who married the author of the article . Soon lie became the champion of woman suffrage in the British Parliament and wrote an eloquent appeal , The Subjection of Women , which was read throughout Western civilization . Thus do world movements grow ? French , English , Polish , American , and I. ; nglish currents swinging to and fro . The national suffrage convention was followed by an extraordinary outburst of propaganda . Pamphlets rolled from the press . Petitions poured in upon legislative bodies . Addresses were delivered by favorite orators , such as Garrison , Phillips , and Curtis ; lectures were given by the great philosopher , Emerson ; and poems were contributed by Longfellow and Whittier . In 1853 a suCfr:ige paper was founded by Anna W. Spencer , the wife of a member of Congress from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to white manhood suffrage had been swept away and the woman movement was running a close second . Woman Suffrage Checked by the Civil War . Advocates of woman suffrage believed themselves on the high road to success when the Civil War came to claim the energies and labors of the whole people . Northern women realized that the prime necessity was to preserve the jnion so they held no suffrage conventions for five years . Instead , they transformed their associations into Loyalty Leagues , aiding Lincoln and trying to induce him to make the terrible ordeal result in the emancipation of slaves . To this end they rolled up monster petitions in favor of a war for Union and liberty . They banded together to buy only domestic goods when foreign imports threatened to destroy American markets . In hospitals , in military prisons , in agriculture , and in industry they bore their full share of responsibility . Even when the New York legislature took advantage of their unguarded moments to repeal the law giving the mother equal rights with the father in 1 he guardianship of children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As in all wars , their devotion was unstinted and their sacrifices equal to the necessities of the hour . The Federal Suffrage Amendment . Plans and activities when the war closed were partly shaped by events beyond women 's control . The emancipation of the slaves and the proposition to give 1 he ballot to freedmen made the question of suffrage a national issue for the first time . Friends of the colored man insisted that the civil liberties just conferred would not be safe unless he was also granted the right to vote for officers to enforce them . Suffragists very pertinently asked why the principle did not apply to women . But their query was ignored . The fourteenth amendment to the federal Constitution , adopted in 1868 , definitely put women aside by limiting the scope of its suffrage clause to male citizens . // This was the signal for the advocates of woman suffrage to carry their case to Washington . In March , 1869 their proposed amendment to the Constitution was introduced in Congress by George W. Julian of Indiana . It provided that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sex , following the language of the fifteenth amendment which forbade disfranchisement on account of race . Support for the amendment , coming from many directions , led the suffragists to believe that it would soon be adopted . For example , in their platform of 1872 , the Republicans praised the women for their loyal devotion to the Union , welcomed them to spheres of wider usefulness , and declared that the demand of any class of citizens for additional rights deserved " respectful consideration . " Experience quickly demonstrated , however , that praise was not the ballot . Indeed , the suffragists already had realized that a tedious contest lay before them . They had revived in 1866 their regular annual convention . Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony gave the name of The Revolution to a paper they founded as a suffrage organ . A national suffrage association was organized and annual pilgrimages were made to Congress to present a claim to the vote . Such activities bore some results . Many eminent Congressmen were converted to their cause and presented it ably to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by most newspapers and looked upon as freakish . The State Campaigns . Discouraged by the outcome of the national campaign , suffragists turned to the voters of the individual SUSAN B. ANTHONY 590 Progressive Democracy and Foreign Relations states and sought the ballot at their hands . Even gains by this process were painfully slow . Wyoming , it is true , while still a territory , granted suffrage to women in 1869 and retained it on becoming a state twenty years later , in spite of strong protests in Congress . In 1893 Colorado established complete political equality . In Utah , the third suffrage state , the cause suffered its ups and downs : women were enfranchised by the territorial legislature : they were deprived of the ballot by Congress in 1887 ; in 1896 on the admission of Utah to the Union they recovered their former rights . During the same year , 1896 , Idaho conferred equal suffrage upon the women . But this was the last victory for several years . The Suffrage Cause in Congress . In the midst of such meager gains among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action by a federal amendment . Between 1878 and 1896 a Senate committee reported the suffrage resolution by a favorable majority on five different occasions and once the subject reached the point of a general debate . However , there were nine unfavorable reports and at no time could anything like the requisite two-thirds vote be obtained for its passage . The Changing Status of Women . Meanwhile , strength to the suffrage movement was steadily coming through the activities of women in other directions . College after college ? Vassar , Bryn Mawr , Smith , Wellesley , to mention a few ? was founded to provide higher education . Other institutions , especially the state universities of the West , opened their doors to women , and they were received into the professions of law , medicine , and the ministry . By the rapid growth of public high schools , in which girls enjoyed the same rights as boys , education was extended still more broadly . The number of women teachers multiplied rapidly from coast to coast . Women were also entering nearly every branch of industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1870 we do not know ; but from that year forward we have the record of the census . Between 1870 and 1900 . the proportion of women in the professions rose from less than two per cent to more than ten per cent ; in trade and transportation from 24.8 per cent to 43.2 f // per cent ; and in manufacturing from 13 to 19 per cent . In 1910 , there were over 8,000,000 women gainfully employed as compared with 30,000,000 men and What Eight Million Women Want was quickly chosen as the title of a book written by Rheta Childe Dorr . When , during the World War , the United States government established the principle of equal pay for equal work and gave official recognition to the value of their services in industry , it was discovered how far women had actually traveled along the road forecast by the leaders of 1848 . Facts were catching lip with theories and ideals . The Club Movement among Women . Over all the country women 's societies and clubs were started to advance this or I hat reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In time organizations of various kinds were feder:tted into city , state , and national associations and drawn into debates on public questions . Under I he leadership of Frances Willard some made temperance reform : i vital issue . Others worked for laws pertaining to prisons , pure food , labor , public health , and municipal government , to list a few items . At their conferences , local , state , and national , civic problems were discussed , until finally , it seems , everything led to Ilie quest for the franchise . By solemn resolution in 1914 , the National Federation of Women 's Clubs , representing nearly two million club women , formally indorsed the suffrage demand . In Copyright by Harris and Ewing the same year the National Education Association , speaking for the public school teachers of the land , added its seal of approval . State and National Action . The suffrage movement now swung along faster in the states . Washington in 1910 , California in 191 I , Oregon , Kansas , and Arizona in 1912 , Nevada and Montana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1913 conferred upon them the right to vote for President of the United States . To hasten victory all along the line , a number of younger suffragists next attempted political tactics such as men were wont to employ . They urged the women who already had the ballot to declare to both political parties that they would vote only for candidates who favored the federal amendment . This plan brought pressure upon Congress from every direction : from the older suffragists who now concentrated on Washington with appeals for justice ; and from the " militants " who besought the women of the West to turn against candidates for President who would not approve the federal amendment . In 1916 , for the first time , a leading presidential candidate , Charles Evans Hughes , representing the Republicans , and a distinguished ex-President , Theodore Roosevelt , indorsed the amendment . National Enfranchisement . Events moved rapidly at last . The great state of New York adopted equal suffrage in 1917 . Oklahoma , South Dakota , and Michigan took the same stand the following year ; and several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to vote for President . Appeals and petitions deluged Congress and the President , and " suffragettes " held daily demonstrations in Washington . Finally on September 30 , .1918 , President Wilson who , but two years before , had opposed federal action and indorsed suffrage by state adoption only , personally urged Congress to pass the suffrage amendment to the Constitution The requisite two-thirds vote was secured in June , 1919 , and the amendment was transmitted to the states for review . When on August 28 , 1920 , Tennessee ratified , the majority of three-fourths required by the Constitution was completed . Thus woman suffrage became the law of the land . With this direct weapon of reform in their possession , women soon set to work to remove various inequalities in state laws such as those affecting their property . // General References Edith Abbott , Women in Industry .

At the opening of the twentieth century the nation had passed from the era of agriculture to that of great machine industry . The number of city dwellers employed for wages as contrasted with the farmers tilling their own soil was continually mounting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the East and immigrants from Europe , was but a memory . Labor had to choose other means for raising its standards of living . Realizing this full well , President Roosevelt said : " A few generations ago , the American workman could have saved money , gone West , and taken up a homestead . Now the free lands were gone . In earlier days , a man who began with a pick and shovel might come to own a mine . That outlet was now closed as regards the immense majority . . . . The majority of men who earned wages in the coal industry , if they wished to progress at all , were compelled to progress not by ceasing to be wage-earners but by improving the conditions under which all the wage-earners of the country lived and worked . " With the disappearance of free land , Roosevelt continued , had come " a crass inequality in the bargaining relation of the employer and the individual employee standing alone . The great coal-mining and coal-carrying companies which employed their tens of thousands could easily dispense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the other hand , however expert , could not dispense with the companies . he needed a job ; his wife and children would starve if he did not get one . . . .

" It was for this reason that President Taft advocated reforms in law " to put // employees of little power and means on a level with their employers in adjusting and agreeing upon their mutual obligations . " John D. Rockefeller , Jr. , one of the great captains of industry , recognized the same facts when he said : " In the early days of the development of industry , the employer and capital investor were frequently one . Daily contact was had between him and his employees , who were his friends and neighbors .... Because of the proportions which modern industry has attained , employers and employees are too often strangers to each other Personal relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Representation is a principle which is fundamentally just and vital to the successful conduct of industry . . . . It is not consistent for us as Americans to demand democracy in government and practice autocracy in industry . . . . With the developments what they are in industry to-day , there is sure to come a progressive evolution from aristocratic single control , whether by capital , labor , or the state , to a democratic , cooperative control by all three . " COOPERATION BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES Company Unions . This changed economic life was similarly acknowledged by several great business concerns . Throughout the country decided efforts were made to bridge the gulf which industry and the corporation had created between employees and employers . Among the plans adopted to accomplish this purpose was the " company union . " In a western lumber mill , for instance , all the employees were invited to join a company organization ; they held monthly meetings to discuss matters of common concern ; they elected a " shop committee " to confer with the representatives of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conferences of the men to talk over matters of mutual interest . It was the function of the shop committee to consider wages , hours , safety rules , sanitation , recreation , and other problems of this kind . Whenever an employee had a grievance , he took it up with the foreman and , if it was not settled to his satisfaction , he brought it before the shop committee . If the members of the shop committee decided in favor of the man with a grievance , they attempted to settle the matter with the company 's agents . All these things failing , the dispute was transferred to a common council including all the employees and the employers ' representatives . A deadlock , if it ensued from such a conference , was broken by calling in impartial arbitrators selected by both sides from among citizens outside the mill . Thus the employees were given a voice in decisions affecting their work and welfare ; and the rights and grievances of each were treated as matters of mutual interest rather than individual concern . Representatives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from all such negotiations between employers and the employees . As industrial workers became more efficient in organizing their own unions to enforce demands , corporations made still greater efforts to form unions on the company plan , with extraordinary success . Profit-Sharing . To give workers an interest in the corporations that employed them , other projects were tried . Occasionally lump sums were paid as " bonuses " to employees who remained in a company 's service for a definite period of years . In some places they were given a percentage of the annual profits . In other instances , employees were allowed to buy stock on easy terms and thus become part owners of the concerns for which they worked . This last plan was carried so far by a large soap manufacturing company that the employees , besides becoming stockholders , secured the right to elect representatives to serve on the board of directors which controlled the entire business . Labor Managers and Welfare Work . Still another effort of employers to meet the problems of the machine age appeared in the appointment of specialists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study the relations between masters and workers and discover practical methods for dealing with each grievance as it arose . By 1918 , hundreds of big companies had recognized this modern " profession " and universities were giving courses of instruction in " personnel management .

The discussion revealed the wide range of duties assigned to managers : questions of wages , hours , sanitation , // rest rooms , recreational facilities , and welfare work of every kind designed to make the conditions in mills and factories safer and more humane . Hundreds of employers had evidently abandoned the idea that their industrial obligations ended the moment hungry workers accepted whatever wage they were willing to pay . In short , they were seeking to develop a spirit of cooperation ? to increase production by promoting the efficiency and happiness of the producers . Besides this , they were coming to see that high wages , by expanding the buying power of the people , enlarged the home market for American goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the next experiment which Europeans came to study . THE RISE AND GROWTH OF ORGANIZED LABOR The American Federation of Labor . Meanwhile a powerful association of workers representing all the leading trades and crafts , organized into unions of their own , had been built up entirely by labor 's own initiative . This was the American Federation of Labor , a nation-wide union of unions , founded in 1886 on the basis of groundwork laid five years before . At the time of its establishment it had approximately 150,000 members . Its growth up to the end of the century was slow , for the total enrollment in 1900 was only 300,000 . Then it had a boom . The membership reached 1,650,000 in 1904 and more than 3,000,000 in 1919 . Also to be counted in the ranks of organized labor were several national unions , friendly to the Federation , though not affiliated with it . Such , for example , were the Railway Brotherhoods with more than half a million members . By the opening of 1920 the total strength of organized labor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if we include their families , that nearly one-fifth of the people of the United States were in some positive way dependent upon the operation of trade unions . Historical Background . This was the culmination of a long and significant labor history . In the age when the American republic was launched , certain skilled workmen ? printers , shoemakers , tailors , and carpenters ? had , as we have seen , formed local unions in the large cities . By the time the slavery issue drew the very existence of the Union into question , the number of local unions had increased by leaps and bounds in all the industrial towns . Moreover , in every large manufacturing city a central labor body , composed of delegates from the unions of the separate trades , had been formed to advance general interests . In the local union the printers or cordwainers , for instance , handled only their special trade problems . But in the central labor union , printers , cordwainers , iron molders , and other craftsmen considered common labor problems and learned , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step was the nation-wide federation of the unions in each skilled craft . To illustrate , the printers of New York , Philadelphia , Boston , and other towns , drew together and formed a national trade union of printers built upon the local unions of that craft . On the eve of the Civil War there were four or five powerful national unions of this character . The expansion of the railway facilitated travel and correspondence and national conventions became possible for workmen of small means . About 1834 an attempt was made to federate the unions of all crafts into a national organization ; but they were not yet ready for that advanced stage . The National Labor Union . The plan which failed in 1834 was tried again in the sixties , at the close of the Civil War . Industries and railways had expanded to meet Northern military requirements ; prices had risen rapidly ; the demand for labor had increased ; and wages had climbed steadily . Workers were forming unions in the cities for self-protection and eight or ten national unions had sprung into being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a continental consolidation of all organized labor to hold the war gains . In 1866 , therefore , the year after the surrender of General Lee at Appomattox , the " National Labor Union " was formed at Baltimore under the leadership of " an experienced organizer , W. IL Sylvis of the iron molders . The prime purpose of this union was not merely to secure labor 's standard demands respecting hours , wages , and conditions of work or to maintain the gains already won . It leaned rather toward political action based on radical theories . Above all , it sought to eliminate the conflict // between capital and labor by making workingmen themselves owners of shops through the formation of cooperative industries . For six years the National Labor Union continued to hold conferences and carry on its propaganda ; but most of the cooperative enterprises failed , political differences arose within the organization , and by 1872 it had come to an end . The Knights of Labor . While the National Labor Union was experimenting , a still more radical organization was formed , known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was founded in Philadelphia in 1869 , first as a secret society with rituals , signs , and passwords ; " so that no spy of the boss can find his way into the lodge room to betray his fellows , " as the Knights said . It sought to bring all laborers , skilled and unskilled , men and women , white and colored , into a mighty body of local and national unions without distinction of trade or craft . By 1885 , ten years after the national organization was established , it boasted a membership of over 700,000 . Although they also believed that workers should cooperate in owning and managing factories and stores , the Knights of Labor went further in a socialist direction by advocating government ownership of railways and other public utilities . By avowing such aims , the Knights awakened hostility among captains of industry and the people at large , especially when they added numerous and prolonged strikes to their record of propaganda . Weaknesses within , as well as foes without , pushed the Knights along the path to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on successfully ; their cooperative experiments failed as those of other labor groups had failed before them ; and the rank and file could not be kept in line . The majority of the members wanted immediate gains in wages or the reduction of hours . There was a limit to the time that hungry workers could remain unemployed merely for a principle and , when their hopes for better conditions faded , they drifted away from the Order . I is troubles were next aggravated by the appearance of the American Federation of Labor composed mainly of skilled workers who held the more strategic positions in industry . When the Knights of Labor failed to secure the support of the Federation in their efforts to organize the unskilled , employers closed in upon them . By 1890 they were a negligible factor and in a short time they passed into the limbo of dead experiments . The Policies of the American Federation . Unlike the Knights of Labor , the American Federation of Labor sought , first of all , to be very practical in its objects and methods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the business of organizing unions for the purpose of increasing wages , shortening hours , and improving working conditions for its members . It did not try to include everybody in one big union or indeed all the workers in separate unions . It brought together the more skilled groups of employees whose craft interests were clearly the same . To prepare for strikes and periods of unemployment , it raised large funds through heavy dues and created a benefit system to hold members loyally to the union . To permit action on a national scale , it gave the superior officers extensive powers over local unions . While declaring that employers and employees had much in common , the Federation strongly opposed company unions . Employers , it argued , had united in the National Manufacturers ' Association or in similar employers ' organizations ; every important industry was now national in scope , that is , it had plants all over the country ; therefore , in view of competition in prices and output , among countless shops from coast to coast , wages and hours could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards in other plants . Even if conditions were excellent iii one factory or mine where the company and its workers met on friendly terms , that did not solve the problem for all the employees in the same industry throughout the land , as the union undertook to do . For these reasons the Federation declared that company unions and local shop committees were unsatisfactory . It insisted that hours , wages , and other labor standards should be fixed by general trade agreement ? applicable to all the plants of a given industry , even if subject to local modifications . On the basis of its strong organization , the Federation sought to avoid strikes and persuade employers that the relation between capital and labor might become one of peaceful bargaining . In // taking this position it had the support of certain manufacturers , financiers , and professional men interested in public affairs , who founded the National Civic Federation in 1900 to promote better industrial relations . Though radical workers objected to this alliance , officers of the Federation frankly welcomed aid from the new ally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention of trying to overthrow it . Their ideal was to secure within this system definite terms and conditions for their members . THE WIDER RELATIONS OF LABOR The Political Appeal . To strict trade unionists the labor problem seemed to involve nothing more than businesslike negotiations , man to man , with employers . But in fact it could not be kept in that simple form . The Federation was only six years old when a new organization , the Socialist Labor party , appealing directly to the industrial workers , nominated a candidate for President and demanded thoroughgoing changes in the capitalist system itself . Trade unionists were now told that mere bargaining with employers was not enough to bring about good working conditions and they were urged to go into politics for the purpose of accomplishing reforms by government action . Modern Socialism . The theories of this political party were founded mainly on the teachings of a German scholar and agitator , Karl Marx . Unlike the " Utopians " of the early nineteenth century , Marx did not advocate the formation of " socialistic " labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the whole world to unite against capitalists , take possession of the machinery of government , and introduce collective or public ownership of railways , lands , mines , mills , and other instruments of production . Marxian socialists were therefore political , as well : is economic , in their aims . They sought to organize labor and to win elections . Like the other parties they put forward candidates and platforms . The Socialist Labor party , for instance , in 1892 , declared i it favor of government ownership of utilities , free school books , woman suffrage , heavy income taxes , and the referendum . A similar position was taken by the Socialist party , founded in 1900 , 602 Progressive Democracy and Foreign Relations with Eugene V. Debs as its candidate ; it too demanded public ownership of monopolies , mines , railways , and the chief means of production . Gradually the socialists became more revolutionary in tone . The Socialist party officially refused to support the United States in the war on Germany in 1917 . Some individual socialists , influenced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the American industrial system by violence . In their appeal for votes , the socialists of every type turned first to industrial workers . At the annual conventions of the American Federation of Labor they urged the delegates to indorse socialism . // But its president , Samuel Gompers , on each occasion , took the floor against them . He repudiated socialism and socialists , both on theoretical and practical grounds . He opposed too much public ownership , declaring that the government was as likely as any private employer to oppress labor . The approval of socialism , he believed , would split the Federation on the rock of politics , prejudice the public against it , and weaken it in its fight for higher wages and shorter hours . Throughout his long term as president , he was able to vanquish the socialists in the Federation , although he could not prevent it from favoring one of their planks in 1920 ? public ownership of railways . The Extreme Radicals . Defeated in their efforts to capture organized labor and to carry elections , some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One faction , the Industrial Workers of the World , founded in 1905 , declared themselves opposed to all capitalists , the wages system , and craft unions . They asserted that the " working class and the employing class have nothing in common " and that trade unions only pit one set of workers against another set . They repudiated government ownership of industries , sought to unite all working people into one big union , and made plans to seize the railways , mines , and mills of the country in the name of revolutionary labor . This doctrine called down upon the heads of its advocates the condemnation of the American Federation of Labor and the general public also . At its convention in 1919 , the Federation went on record as " opposed to Bolshevism , I. W. W.-ism , and the irresponsible leadership that encourages such a policy . " It announced its " firm adherence to American ideals . " The Federation and Political Issues . The hostility of the Federation to socialists of every kind did not mean , however , that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary , from time to time , at its annual conventions , it indorsed specific reforms , such as the initiative , referendum , and recall , the abolition of child labor , the exclusion of Oriental labor , old-age pensions , and government ownership in certain lines . To forward its projects it adopted the policy of " rewarding friends : end punishing enemies : " that is , it advised its members to vote for 604 Progressive Democracy and Foreign Relations or against the candidates of political parties according to their stand on the specific demands of organized labor . This policy the Federation pursued with especial zeal in dealing with the use of court injunctions in labor controversies . An injunction is a bill or writ issued by a judge ordering some person or corporation to do or not to do some specific thing . For example , a judge may order a trade union to refrain from interfering with non-union men or to continue at work handling goods made by non-union labor ; and he may fine or imprison those who disobey his injunction , the penalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal device came into prominence during nation-wide railway strikes in 1877 . It was used effectively against Eugene V. Debs , director of the Pullman strike of 1894 , and then applied with increasing frequency as a method for blocking labor tactics . With strikes broken and leaders imprisoned under injunction orders , organized labor demanded that the power of judges to issue such writs in industrial disputes be limited by law . Representatives of the unions asked both the Republicans and the Democrats to approve their proposal and received from the latter a very definite and cordial indorsement . In 1896 the Democratic platform denounced " government by injunction as a new and highly dangerous form of oppression . " While refusing to commit the Federation to the Democratic party as such , Gompers privately supported its candidate , William Jennings Bryan . In 1908 he came out openly for Bryan and boasted that eighty per cent of the votes of the Federation were cast for the Democratic candidate . Again in 1912 the same policy was pursued . And the reward was the enactment in 1914 of a federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trade , limiting the use of the injunction in labor disputes , and prescribing trial by jury in case of contempt of court . This measure was hailed by Gompers as the " Magna Charta of Labor " and a vindication of his policy . As a matter of fact , however , it did not prevent the continued use of injunctions against trade unions . Even so , Gompers refused to sanction an independent labor party or radical economic plans . When the American Federation of Labor supported Senator La Follette for PresiIndustrial // dent in 1924 , it did not join a third party ; it merely gave him its official encouragement for the time being . After that experiment it continued its former " non-partisan " position . Organized Labor and the Public . Besides its relations to employers , to radicals within its own ranks , and to various political questions , the Federation had to face obligations to a third factor in industry ? the general purchasing public . With the passing of time these became heavy and serious . While industries were small and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody but the employer and the employees immediately involved . When , however , industries and trade unions became organized on a national scale , a strike could paralyze a basic enterprise like coal mining or railways , and thus put in jeopardy the vital interests of all citizens . For the purpose of avoiding as far as possible such ruinous strikes , it was suggested by various reformers that employers and employees lay their disputes before commissions of arbitration for review and settlement . In a message of April 2 , 1886 , President Cleveland approved this idea and two years later Congress applied it in a law which made arrangements for the voluntary arbitration of labor controversies arising on interstate railways . The principle was later extended by Congress and fully incorporated in the Railway Labor Act of 1926 , providing for a board of mediation to hear disputes respecting wages , hours , and rules of employment . The initial success of this legislation led certain students of industrial questions to urge that unions and employers should be compelled , not merely permitted , to submit all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kansas actually passed such a " compulsory arbitration " law in 1920 , but it was strongly opposed by both labor and capital . In the course of time the Supreme Court of the United States declared the Kansas statute unconstitutional and it seemed generally agreed that the scheme was not practical . IMMIGRATION AND AMERICANIZATION Labor and the Problem of Immigration . From its very beginning , the Federation of Labor had to meet numerous questions created by an ever-swelling stream of immigrant workers flowing into the United States . When it tried to unionize all the employees in a given trade , the Federation usually had to deal wit h many foreign language groups . Carrying on meetings in five or six tongues was not easy ! Then after it had managed by hard labor to organize all the workers in a certain craft and raise their wages , it sometimes saw its efforts undone by a fresh influx of foreigners willing to accept lower rates . So labor leaders came to the conclusion that they could not form successful unions and uphold good standards of living as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act as strike breakers . Outside the labor movement , citizens at large also began to have some doubts about the wisdom of keeping the nation 's door , wide open for the " alien invasion . " These doubters saw whole sections of great cities occupied by people speaking foreign tongues , reading only foreign newspapers , and tied fast to the Old World by loyalty and custom . They witnessed an expanding army of total illiterates , men and women who could read and write no language at all ; while among those aliens who could read , few there were who knew anything of American history , traditions , and ideals . Official reports revealed that over twenty per cent of the men of the draft army during the World War could not read a newspaper or write a letter home . Perhaps most alarming of all was the discovery that thousands of alien men were in the United States only on a temporary sojourn , solely to make money and go back to Europe or Asia with their savings . These men , willing to work for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beings , had no stake in this country and did not care what became of it . They could not share in the progress of the labor movement or feel any interest in American citizenship . The Restriction of Immigration . Yet in all this there was no cause for surprise . Since the foundation of the republic the policy of the government had been to encourage immigration . For nearly one hundred years no restraining act was passed by Congress , while two important laws actually promoted it ; namely , the Homestead Act of 1862 and the contract immigration law of 1864 . Not until American workingmen came into collision with Chinese labor on the Pacific Coast did the federal government pass its first measure of limitation . With the discovery of gold and particularly after the opening of the railway construction era , a horde of laborers from China had descended upon California . Long used to starvation earnings and to poverty-stricken conditions of living , they threatened to cut American standards of wages to the lowest point of subsistence . In time the protest of American labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Democrats to heed it . Accordingly in 1882 Congress by a law prohibited the admission of Chinese laborers to the United States for a term of ten years ? a rule later changed into permanent exclusion . In a little while the demand arose for a bar against the Japanese , but in this case no exclusion law was passed . Instead , an understanding was reached with Japan , in 1907 , known as the " Gentlemen 's AgreeIndustrial // ment . " Under this arrangement Japan promised to stop issuing passports to laborers permitting them to sail for the United States and President Roosevelt made a pledge that the government would not adopt a Japanese exclusion act . Having embarked upon the policy of restriction in 1882 , Congress readily extended it . In that same year it forbade the admission of paupers , criminals , convicts , and the insane . Mainly owing to the pressure of the Knights of Labor , it forbade , in 1885 , any person , company , or association to import aliens under contract to work for any specific employer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made even more severe . In 1903 anarchists were excluded and the bureau of immigration was transferred from the Treasury Department to the Department of Commerce and Labor , in order to provide for a more rigid execution of the law . In 1907 the classes of persons denied admission were extended to embrace those suffering from physical and mental defects and otherwise unfit for citizenship . When the Department of Labor was established in 1913 the enforcement of the law was placed in the hands of the Secretary of Labor ? usually chosen by the President from among labor leaders or persons in sympathy with trade-union ideals . Not yet appeased , organized labor demanded further protection against the competition of immigrants . In 1917 it won another advance in its thirty-year battle by the passage of a bill , over President Wilson 's veto , excluding " all aliens over sixteen years of age , physically capable of reading , who can not read the English language or some other language or dialect , including Hebrew or Yiddish . " By this time a lively opposition to the restriction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain races already in the United States objected to every barrier that shut out their own kinsmen ; while some Americans of the old stock still held to the belief that the United States should continue to be an asylum for the oppressed of the earth . " And many employers , desiring an increase in the number of wage-earners , also protested against further restraints . But Congress leaned toward more rather than less restriction . Indeed in 1921 it adopted a principle which made a deep cut , in immigration . It absolutely limited the number of aliens to he admitted from most countries to a certain percentage of their citizens already in the United States in 1910 . In 1924 it made the rule more drastic , abolished the arrangement with Japan , known as the " Gentlemen 's Agreement , " and put the Japanese on the same basis as the Chinese ( page 679 ) . Americanization . Intimately connected with the problem of immigration was a call for the " Americanization " of the aliens already within our gates . The revelation of illiteracy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was intensified when it was found that many of the leaders among the extreme radicals were foreign in birth and citizenship . Innumerable programs for assimilating the alien to American life were drawn up , and in 1919 a national conference on the subject was held in Washington under the auspices of the Department of the Interior . All agreed that the foreigner should at least be taught to speak and write the English language and to understand the government of the United States ? even if he continued to use his native tongue and read the newspapers of his race . Partly as a result of this movement , there was an enormous increase in the money spent for popular education . America , as Roosevelt had said , was to find out " whether it was a nation or a boarding-house . " . // Questions 1 . What are the striking features of the new economic age ? 2 .
