In 1929 , the U. S. maternal mortality rate ( 69.5 per 100,000 live births ) was higher than that of any large European country except Scotland . Last week in the Journal of the American Medical Association , Dr. Scott C. Runnels , secretary of the Hospital Obstetric Society of Ohio , announced that , according to the latest statistics , the U. S. maternal mortality rate had dropped 22% in the period from 1930 to 1937 . Reason : more women go to hospitals for delivery now than ever before . However , added Dr. Runnels , the maternal death rate is still appallingly high in many sections of the U. S. One fourth of maternal deaths , he said , are caused by abortion and ectopic pregnancy ( development of a foetus outside the uterus ) .
