Oh , Lila , I love you . <P> Hello , London , are you there ? <P> Minnie . . . father . . . upper . . . rather . . . tata ! <P> Radio listeners in the U. S. heard gibberish of this sort one day last week , pronounced in a queer , blurred , atonal voice like that of a person who has been stone deaf since birth . As a matter of fact the words , which came from London , were not spoken by a human being at all but were uttered by an apparatus in the hands of Sir Richard Paget , 69-year-old barrister , linguist , musician , acoustician , who clings to the old British tradition that well-disposed people of the aristocracy should take an interest in the arts and sciences . <P> Sir Richard believes that human speech is primitive , that gestures could be much more expressive . His voice apparatus is largely a metal and fabric tube which has parts corresponding to the larynx , tongue , and palate . He gets recognizable syllables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air is furnished by a bellows which he operates with his foot . Although he designed it to show , by crude but effective imitation , the crudity of human speech , some U. S. listeners thought they could detect in its manual utterances a trace of British accent .
