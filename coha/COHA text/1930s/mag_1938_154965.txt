Administrator Nathan Straus of the U. S. Housing Authority , which has been granted $800,000,000 from Congress for slum clearance since its organization 13 months ago , last week slammed his books shut , announced that the Authority was " broke but happy . ' ' Although there were only 46 local housing authorities when USHA set up shop , there are now 221 ( in 31 States ) qualified to take advantage of USHA 's bargain terms-90% of the cost in longterm , low-interest loans-for slum clearance and low-rental housing programs . Not actually broke , USHA has signed $291,656,000 worth of contracts , earmarked $355,919,000 more , will keep the rest of its nest egg as a " safety margin " until fresh funds are forthcoming . Without directly asking for any , Administrator Straus broadly hinted : " This agency could easily earmark $500,000,000 more if it had it . "
