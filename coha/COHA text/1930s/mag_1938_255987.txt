Probably no group of writers or politicians has less respect for each other than the Katzenjammer Kids of the radical movement . Their polemical outbursts are juicy with accusations and counteraccusations . Almost invariably they get home safely , for good radicals , adhering to an unwritten code , usually scorn the capitalist courts . Past master at this sort of street-fighting is New York 's Daily Worker , central organ of the Communist Party , U. S. A. Its most galling volleys are reserved for its rival gang , Leon Trotsky and his followers . So bitter has this battle become that unwritten codes have been forgotten : the other gang finally called a cop . The Daily Worker is now being sued for a total of $745,000 in damages for libel . <P> Biggest suit was started last February by William S. Brown , as president of the General Drivers , Helpers and Inside Workers Union Local 544 in Minneapolis , and individually , also by Farrell Dobbs , a member of the union , and the fabulous Dunne brothers , Grant , Miles and Vincent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minneapolis in 1934 . The plaintiffs are demanding $470,000 for articles in the Daily Worker linking them with the criminal underworld . <P> Fortnight ago , Mrs. Edith Liggett , widow of Walter W. Liggett , Minneapolis editor who was shot and killed in December 1935 , won a $25,000 verdict after an undefended libel suit against the Daily Worker , which had accused the murdered editor , no Trotskyite , of using his paper for blackmail . Last week , the New York Supreme Court granted the Daily Worker permission to enter a belated defense . <P> Most ominous libel suit of all was one filed last week against the Daily Worker , its editor , Clarence A. Hathaway , and Earl Browder , general secretary of the Communist Party , by Max Eastman , author ( Enjoyment of Laughter ) and lecturer , whose skillful translations of Trotsky 's works have done much to keep Trotsky 's ideas current in the English-speaking world . Author Eastman charged that the Daily Worker had finally gone too far , sued for $250,000 in damages . Plaintiff Eastman : " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty . . . . Every man who believes in ... democratic civilization as against tyranny and barbarism ought to&gt; fight the American Communist Party with every honorable weapon in his grasp . . . . " Defendant Browder , appealing to the unwritten code , accused Plaintiff Eastman of carping at the Soviets ; " When we call public attention to this , he turns to the courts to try to silence us . We have never asked the courts to silence Eastman 's slander against us. . . . "
