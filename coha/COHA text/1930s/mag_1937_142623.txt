The use by college students of a new , powerful but poisonous brain stimulant called Benzedrine last week kept college directors of health in dithers of worry . Cases of over-dosage have been uncovered at the Universities of Minnesota , Wisconsin and Chicago . Elsewhere students who , while cramming for final examinations , collapse , faint , develop insomnia , or show a slowed pulse rate are under suspicion of using the substance . They call it " pepper-up , " " pep pills . " <P> Swallowed as a tablet or inhaled as a gas , Benzedrine at first shrinks mucous membranes , raises blood pressure , quickens the heart , sharpens the wits . These effects are powerful enough to snap a schizophrenic out of his murky mentality ( TIME , Sept. 14 ) . Small doses of the drug maintain his intelligence . Overdoses , such as uninformed college students seem to be using , bring on dangerous after effects . <P> This week University of Chicago 's director of health , Dr. Dudley B. Reed , was to publish a warning in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruth Boynton already warned , without much apparent good : " It 's burning the candle at both ends . It means burning up more energy than the body has time to replenish . While we know the pills keep one awake , so little is actually known of their cumulative effects that we think it unwise for students to take them without a physician 's advice . No more than two of these pills should be taken in any 24-hour period . The size of dose , however , depends a great deal on the individual . People with heart trouble and high blood pressure obviously should not take Benzedrine . " <P> At the University of Toronto , the dean of women , Marion Black Ferguson , tried another method to forestall the pep-pill fad among woman students . She sees that they maintain their wits and vigor by taking pills containing calcium and phosphorus , eating regularly , going to bed early .
