In trim khaki , eschewing gold braid and gaudy epaulets , the 1935 model Chinese field marshals , generals and satraps gathered in Nanking last week . Almost every Chinese of importance was there . Never before had China 's Methodist Dictator , Generalissimo Chiang Kaishek , drawn around himself quite so many of China 's military lite . Even the great has-been among Chinese war lords , strapping , whimsical and always surprising " Christian Marshal " Feng Yu-hsiang , trekked down from his retirement near the Tai Shan ( " Sacred Mountain " ) to announce good humoredly that he is " now a devout Buddhist . " <P> Electric in the air was a feeling that at this year 's Congress of the Government Party or Kuomintang , it might be possible to face the realities of China and Japan squarely , or at least as squarely as Oriental minds can face anything . The reality is that a policy of Asiatic cooperation , even with vast China flying for some years as the kite on Japan 's string , might get the Orient somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> To have their group photograph taken last week the militant galaxy took their places on the steps of Kuomintang Party Headquarters with Dictator Chiang , Dummy President Lin Sen and Premier Wang Ching-wei . Among Chinese politicians the Premier rated last week as the most ardent and ablest exponent of the kite &; string foreign policy for China and he was not only Premier but also Foreign Minister . <P> As the official photographer disappeared under his black cloth , Chinese cameramen began to snap . Suddenly out of a Chinese camera was whipped a pistol . Bang , bang , bang ! Three bullets winged Premier Wang in the arm , neck and abdomen . As he crumpled , the pantherlike Generalissimo and China 's whole quick-triggered lite were returning the assassin 's fire . <P> In the orgy of Chinese marksmanship a janitor and a onetime Minister of Justice fell , their winging being charged to the assassin . Everyone else 's bullets hit nobody as nimble Chinese statesmen ran like rabbits and the Chinese militarists formed a hollow square around crumpled Wang . <P> Unfortunately the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was said to be no relative of the Nanking Government 's late , sainted Dr. Sun Yatsen , leader of the revolution which upset the Imperial Manchu Throne in 1911 . Last week 's Sun was promptly branded a " Communist . " Millions of Chinese considered him a patriot , hoped pro-Japanese Premier Wang was dying , regretted that Sun had not shot also China 's pro-Japanese Kingpin , the Generalissimo . <P> In Shanghai , where well-to-do Chinese are cold to the white-hot flame of Chinese patriotism , hospital bulletins on the Premier were anxiously snatched as fast as they came in . Next day , at a rumor that Wang was dead , panic began to sweep Shanghai 's Exchange . Solid gold bars- " the only safe thing " - soared up as everything else fell . Then gold receded as the Premier 's condition was said to be " satisfactory . " Same day Shooter Sun died of wounds .
