txt The story of how the New York Clearing House , the United States Treasury Department and the Department of Justice stayed the prosecution of Joseph W. Harriman for nine months after false entries were found on the books of his bank was spread upon the record of a Senate investigating committee here yesterday . In the interim , four members tof the Judiciary Committee 's subcommittee sitting for the day in the old Federal Building were told , the " business as usual " slogan prevailed among the officers and directors of the Harriman National Bank and Trust Company until it was closed , not to reopen , when the bank holiday was proclaimed on March 5 . A. J. Columbo , who described himself as " cashier in name only , " admitted that he had signed his name to a letter declaring all was serene in the bank months after C. C. Francis , a Federal bank examiner , had called his attention to false entries amounting to more than $1,300,000 . Directors Held Harriman 's Stock . Francis S. Williamson , former executive vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right on soliciting new business and asserted that Henry E. Cooper , whom the Clearing House installed as president after deposing Mr. Harriman , urged the " directors themselves to take a more active part in obtaining new accounts . " Mr. Cooper , the present conservator of the bank , was called upon to deny that he had sought personally to push sales of the bank 's stock as recently as last March , when he had admitted he was fully cognizant of the institution 's condition . Henry S. Schendel , a retired leather goods merchant , had complained to the committee that on Mr. Cooper 's advice he had purchased seventy-five shares of the bank 's stock at $21 a share about March 1 . Mr. Cooper said he did not recommend the stock 's purchase , but acted as Mr. Schendel 's agent at his request . Mr. Schendel took the stand long enough to assert that every word in his complaint was true , thus leaving the matter an issue between the conservator and himself . Two former direqors of the bank , James L. Turner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitled them to positions on the board of directors of the bank really was owned by Mr. Harriman . Not one of the ten officers who testified did anything about conditions in the bank , but " left everything to Mr. Harriman . " Neely Clashes With Witness . Once the narrative of the disintegration of the Harriman National Bank , whose founder is to go on trial a week from tomorrow in Federal Court for misappropriation of funds , was interrupted by a near fist fight between Senator Matthew M. Neely of West Virginia and Nugent Dodds , Assistant Attorney General in the Hoover administration . Mr. Dodds , a slight man with a shock of white hair , had assumed full responsibility for advising United States Attorney George Z. Medalie not to prosecute Mr. Harriman until the bank had received an opportunity , under Mr. Cooper 's guidance and the protective wing of the Clearing House , to get itself into a more liquid position . Any other course , he asserted , might have precipitated a banking catastrophe of nation-wide scope and effect . Senator Neely was frankly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of law-enforcing officials , he declared , that had undermined public confidence in the banks . Mr. Dodds , who disclaimed any desire to inject partisan politics into the hearing , remarked that he hoped the new administration would find a way to deal effectively with the situation . " Why did n't the previous administration interest itself in that problem ? " demanded the nattily dressed Democratic Senator from West Virginia . " If you think , " retorted Mr. Dodds heatedly , " that there is any virtue in either political party so far as national banks are concerned , you have a lot to learn while you are in the Senate . " " Thievery " in Banks Assailed . " I hope , " snapped Senator Neely , leaning across the table and half rising from his seat , " that I have n't as much to learn as you have about how to deal with ' thieves who run wild in the country robbing banks . I do n't want to know how to bury reports of thievery so that conditions threatening the public welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole Harriman affair . " Mr. Dodds 's face went white . His hands shook and his voice trembled when he said : " The Senator knows that what he is saying is not the truth . " The West Virginian jumped to his feet and seized a water carafe on the table , about which he and his colleagues and the witness were seated , surrouxded by a cluster of newspaper men . Mr. Dodds , too , arose , his brief-case under his arm , and startea toward the Senator , whose hand was stayed by the genial and pacific Senator Henry F. Ashurst of Arizona , the Judiciary Committee chairman , who presided . Senator Ashurst called upon Mr. Dodds to apologize , but the former Assistant Attorney General said he would take a sentence for contempt before he would do so . " Sit down , then , " said Senator Ashz3rst , giving his West Virginia colleague a soothing pat on the shoulder . Senator Patrick McCarran of Nevada then undertook to calm Mr. Dodds with a series of questions . Before he left Mr. Dodds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Earlier in the day Mr. Dodds had ruffled the Senatorial dignity by referring to the interference to which administrative officers were subjected by " Senators , Representatives and others on Capitol Hill " in the exercise of their duties . The minute a bank came under fire , he said , the members of Congress from that district would deluge him with requests for delay . Federal bank examinations at best were superficial , he said , consisting chiefly of making inquiries of cashiers and other bank officers . Simple legislation , requiring examiners to notify the larger depositors of the amount of their accounts , would do away with from one-third to one-half of the present number of defalcations by bank officials and employes , he asserted . While he was on the subject of government supervision of national banks , Mr. Dodds told the Senators false entries on the books of banks were by no means as unusual as some persons might think . He expressed the opinion that there was scarcely a national bank in the country that had not had false entries in its books at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would be shocked to learn that more than 10 per cent of the peculations were by bank presidents . Most of them were committed by cashiers , clerks and other minor employes , he said . At the former Assistant Attorney General 's reference to interference from Capitol Hill , Senator Ashurst inquired if he meant that any member of the committee had indulged in such actions . Mr. Dodds , now an attorney in private practice in Washington , said he would have to consult his diary . At this point Senator Daniel 0 . Hastings , the Republican member from Delaware , declared : " My recollection is that last Fall , at the request of the president of a. bank in my State that action against a certain official should not , be prosecuted at the immediate present , I called up Mr. Dodds on the telephone and asked him to look up that particular case and , find out what the facts were ? and . whether the request could be granted . " He told me that the case was a bad one and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold it up . I reported back to  --  the bank president and that was all . " Senator Ashurst remarked that he saw " nothing improper " in what Senator Hastings had done . Mr. Dodds , questioned by Senator Hastings , said he had no personal interest in any one connected with the Harriman Bank case . He expressed the opinion that to have proceeded " savagely " to prosecute in the face of the bank crisis would have been to " do more harm than good . " Cooper Tells of Asking Delay . The hearing lasted from 10 A. M. until after 6 P. M. The proceedings were conducted iri a large court room with an imposing lack of formality . The four committee members sat at ogle - side of a long table , facing the witness , at whose elbow was the official stenographer . Newspaper representatives were allowed to smoke , but the spectators were not . At the end of the session , which concluded the committee 's activities in New York City , much that had been mere rumor , conjecture and allegation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time since the Harriman National Bank 's doors failed to open on March 14 . Mr. Cooper testified that the New York clearing house had ousted Mr. Harriman as president of the bank and put him in charge in July , 1932 , soon after examiners , first discovered the false entries in. the books . He accompanied Elton Bisbee , attorney for the clearing house , and Boykin Wright , Mr. Harriman 's son-In-law , to Washing delay in prosecution of his predecessor , he said , because he " had the pledge of the clearing house to see us through . " Mr. Dodds likewise had testified that he was guided somewhat in his decision to defer criminal action in the Harriman case until conditions improved because he had been given to understand , at his meeting with Messrs . Bisbee , Wright and Cooper , that the clearing house was " behind the new set-up of the bank . " Whether the clearing house was ready to lend financial as well as moral support , he said , he did not know . Medalie Instructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the statement of United States Attorney George Z. Medalie , the first witness , . that he had recommended delay in the prosecution after the matter first came to his attention on Dec ? 23 , 1932 , six months after the alleged defalcations were discovered . Mr. Dodds did not attempt to explain the six months ' delay in the Treasury Department 's reporting the case to him for action after bank examiners reported the alleged defalcations of more than $1 , - 000,000 to the Controller of the Currency in June or July of 1932 . If the Treasury was guided by the same motives that guided him ? treading softly on what he described as " rubber ice " ? Mr. Dodds expressed the opinion that the delay had been justified . The former Department of Justice officer described the banking situation of the last days of President Hoover 's administration as so acute that the slightest breath of suspicion against even so relatively unimportant a banking institution as the Harriman National Bank might have caused " financial chaos , " Everybody of importance in the Treasury and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needles , not knowing whether the crash would come in Chicago or New York , but certain that a false step would precipitate it . Bank 's Officers Knew Conditions . Great as the concern of the government officials may have been , none of it was reflected in the testimony of the bank officers who appeared before the committee . With the exception of John M. Jordan , an assistant cashier , all had known in a general way what was going on in the bank , but none had done anything to stop it , they indicated . Most of them ! earned from bank examiners that Mr. Harriman had been debiting the accounts of depositors to buy the bank 's stock in the open market at about $1,500 a share . They were only mildly concerned when Mr. Cooper ( Us -- closed to them last December the amount of the defalcations at a directors ' meeting . They received the news in silence and each went about his business as usual , keeping the secret to himself . There was John A. Noble , a director , who said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of illness . He said he had an investment of some $330,000 in the stock of the bank and reckoned his loss at more than $1,000,000 because he could have sold out and did not when the boom was at its peak . He had heard in September , 1932 , that there were irregularities in the books . " What could I do about it ? " he asked with a gesture of helplessness when Senator McCarran asked why he had not made a thorough investigation and reported to his fellow directors . " You knew that you were custodian of public money as an officer of the bank , did n't you ? " he was asked . " Yes , under Mr. Harriman 's direction , " he replied . He added that he could not " get the money back , " and that he was " too sick to worry about it . " Mr. Harriman was the " whole show , " - other witnesses testified . When he issued orders they were obeyed not only bye the employes but usually by the directors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harriman organized a pool in 1930 to buy up available shares of the bank 's stock at the market . Tell of Stock-Buying " Pool . " , - The founder of the closed bank told the directors he wanted to be sure the stock of distress sellers fell into responsible hands . He proposed that the directors form a syndicate to buy and sell the bank 's stock , and an agreement was drawn up by which all but a few of the directors pledged themselves to take up twenty shares of the stock , as they later were called upon to do at a cost to each of $30,000 . This syndicate was organized without any capital . The directors never gave a thought to the problem of how it was to acquire the stock but were content to let Mr. Harriman solve that problem . No one asked any questions about the ' syndicate until he was called upon to redeem his pledge . " Did you expect Mr. Harriman to obtain the money for the stock purchases by taking it from private accounts ? " one witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time , " was the answer . Seemingly none of those who signed their names to the syndicate agreement ever expected to have to hand over the money for the shares he had agreed to buy . Albert B. Kerr , attorney for several of the directors who were not present , defended their action by calling the agreement " an answer to a patriotic appeal . " Indicted Officer Is Heard . Mr. Harriman was not at the hearing . Albert S. Austin , the vice president who was indicted with him , appeared briefly as a witness . He was accompanied by I. D. Hall , a young lawyer from the office of Charles Tuttle , former United States Attorney . Mr. Hall 's constant interruptions of questions irked Senator McCarran . " If ytou do n't want him to answer , let him , say he refuses on the ground that to do so would incriminate him , " the Senator said . Mr. Hall then , edged his chair up behind Mr. Austin and prodded him in the back with a pencil when he thought his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have Mr. Austin tell who , other than himself and not under his direction , had made false entries in the books of the bank . When the witness , in accordance with his lawyer 's prod- I ding , declined to answer , Senator Ashurst hinted mildly at contempt proceedings before the Senate . Before he left the stand , however , Mr. Austin said that whatever was done was at Mri Harri-1 man 's direction , and it was understood the contempt action would not be pressed . William A. Burke , vice president and controller , testified he knew of Mr. Harriman 's alleged defalcations , but never reported them to the board of directors because , he said , Mr. Harriman knew all about them and he was chairman of the board . It , was Mr. Harriman 's practice , he said , to get a daily balance of all accounts amounting to more than $5,000 . Thus he was able to ten whose accounts it was safe to debit for the purchase of an unordered block of stock , he inditon. in December , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
