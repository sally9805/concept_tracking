CALVATION ARMY members made their usual appear- ance on city streets some days before Christmas , erecting their familiar tripods with underslung pots and tinkling their bells in the annual appeal for funds . But instead of the well-remembered slogan , " Keep the pot boiling " ( presumably to cook the chicken which Mr. Hoover put there ) , a new placard was displayed , reading , " It 's worse to be poor at Christmas . " This is an unfinished statement which leaves us guessing . Does the Salvation Army mean it is worse to be poor at Christmas than to be rich ? Or it is worse to be poor at Christmas than at New Year 's ? Or what ? We think the slogan ought to be amended in the interest of clarity if not charity . Our own suggestion for a change would be , " It is unnecessary to be poor at Christmas or any other time . " But then , of course , the Salvation Army would glean fewer nickels , dimes , and quarters in the places - where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . T HE BILL of the United States for war-debt payments fell due on December 15 . Of the some $300,000,000 ( including back payments still unmet ) due to Uncle Sam on that day , he received $8,898,123 , or a settlement of a little less than three cents on the dollar . Five of the elevencountries from which instalments were due paid nothing at all . Great Britain , which owes $117,670,765 , paid $7,500 , - 000 ? in American currency at the current rate of exchange ! France has again declared its intention to default payment . For the second time Finland alone paid its instalment in full , without a plea for reduction . ( More than one American citizen would doubtless like to know what the Finnish system of finance is . ) Surely these figures must show to all but the most hide-bound intransigents that it is and has for a long time been folly to attempt to collect these moneys . The time has passed when the United States could effectively bargain with the war debts , as it has passed when this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . About all that remains for us to console ourselves with is promises that the debts are not forgotten . We may be sure they are not forgotten . Uncle Shylock will long be remembered by his European neighbors and erstwhile colleagues . But it is doubtful if their memory of him will be altogether flattering . T ORIES may oppose Mr. Roosevelt 's monetary policy for purely selfish reasons . Such an accusation , however , can not be leveled against Secretary of Agriculture Wallace . True , Mr. Wallace does not directly say that he opposes the Administration 's program of gold buying and currency manipulation . In his annual report he is content merely to point out some of the fallacies of that program . He is apparently anxious to save the farmers from being duped by inflationary devices ostensibly designed to help them . " It is impossible , " Mr. Wallace asserts , " for the government in its monetary policy to single out any particular group of prices for special attention . By itself monetary action does nothing to change maladjusted situations for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorable change by temporarily hiding the need . . . . It is well to bear in mind the probability that the favorable influence of our monetary policy on the prices of cotton and wheat may not continue if foreign countries reduce the weight of gold behind their currencies as rapidly as we do . . . . Currency policies may stimulate our exports temporarily but should not lead us to believe that a world-wide demand exists for our surpluses , unless sufficient changes have been made in our tariffs to build up sufficiently increased foreign purchasing power . " T HE NAME of Rexford G. Tugwell is sending cold chills up the spine of the advertising profession and its vociferous dependent , the publishing business . To discover the coldness of the chills and their incidence it is only necessary to look at Printers ' Ink , a journal for advertisers , for December 14 . Under the present pure food and drug law , as everyone knows , the government must prove in court that a product is injurious to the consumer before it can proceed against the manufacturer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance the evidence has taken the form of the death certificates of several consumers  --  which has seemed a little extreme even to laissez fairists . The new law attempts to stop up these fatal loopholes . But the advertisers and the publishers of advertising see in the bill , first , Dictatorship , and second , Ruin . The seeds of dictatorship , it seems , lie in the provision by which the Secretary of Agriculture is directed to give publicity to proceedings and judgments against manufacturers and their products and to information he considers necessary in the public interest . Ruin lies in the innocent statement , among others , that " a right of action shall accrue to any person for injury or death caused by a violation of this act " ( lawsuits for damages are expensive both to reputations and to finances ) , and in the possibility which the advertisers profess to see in the bill of a government grading scheme through which consumers would know whether a product was A , B , or C without looking at the gaily colored and extremely profitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ INK discloses other interesting facts and points of view . Editorially , for instance , it informs us that " after a hectic two-day hearing . . . it became apparent that Senator Copeland , chairman , . . . is vigorously against the measure in its present form . " The consumer , it seems , was the object of special concern at the hearing . John Benson , president of the American Association of Advertising Agencies , " was particularly concerned " about the consumer , inasmuch as " upon his or her confidence in advertising depends any permanent extent of advertising effort . " It was the same kind of concern no doubt which led to the statement of Lee H. Bristol , of the Association of National Advertisers . " The advertiser , " he said , " has studied and knows the consumer , depends for his living on him or her . In some cases the advertiser by study and experience knows what . the consumer wants better than does the consumer himself , " The consumer , we are surei will-be gratified by- this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though it bears some similarity to the interest that the Walrus and the Carpenter displayed in the little oysters . But if the consumer is wise he will insist that the new pure food , drug , and cosmetic act be passed with no basic modifications . Meanwhile , one telling blow against the government should be recorded . A spokesman for the publishers at the hearing stated that even government advertising was sometimes misleading . He produced a flamboyant poster bearing the words " Join the Navy and See the World . " " I personally know of several young men , " he said in effect , " who joined the navy five years ago and have been in the Brooklyn Navy Yard ever since . " A MBASSADOR BULLITT accompanied the presentation of his credentials to the Russian government with some earnest words not only on the significance of his historic mission but also on the desire of the United States to work with the Soviets for the establishment of world peace . Their close collaboration in this task would , Mr. Bullitt declared , " draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in many other fields . He did not overstate the opportunity before the two peoples , notably in the Far East , where the whole question of war and peace presents itself at every turn . We believe that Mr. Bullitt will be fully equal to his great task . He brings with him not only a considerable knowledge of Russia , as he said , but genuine regard for the Russian people . More than that , our memory goes back to the report made by him and Lincoln Steffens to Woodrow Wilson and Lloyd George in the spring of 1919 when the first two had been dispatched to Moscow on a reconnoitering expedition to advise the treaty-making statesmen what course to follow in regard to Russia . Mr. Bullitt favored recognition at that time , and showed a complete grasp and understanding of the situation . But Mr. Wilson would not accept Mr. Bullitt 's report because it was not what he wished it to be , and Lloyd George had the effrontery to deny a little later in the House of Commons that he had ever talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British Premier 's guest at breakfast after his return ! It is no exaggeration to say that the history of the world since that date was gravely affected by the failure to take Mr. Bullitt 's advice and by the embarkation of the great Powers upon a policy of encircling Russia with bayonets . President Roosevelt 's appointment of Mr. Bullitt as our first Ambassador is only a bit of historic justice , a fitting recognition of his work in 1919 . THREE WARRANTS charging murder in the first de- gree have already been issued in St. Joseph , Missouri , for the lynching of Lloyd Warner , Negro , on November 28 . Following an admirable statement by Governor McKittrick denouncing mob violence wherever it occurred , Circuit Judge J. V. Gaddy , in charging a grand jury to bring indictments for every person suspected of having had a part in the lynching , did not mince words . " That lynching was not done by good , outraged citizens , " he said . " It was done by men whose moral standards , you will find , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That lynching was murder , nothing but cowardly , despicable murder . . . . The man who pulled off the jail door , or any man who helped in any way to break into the jail , is just as guilty of murder as the man who placed the rope around Warner 's neck . " Shall not the same thing be said of the Governor of a State who declares he will not send troops to interfere with persons who are about to take the law into their own hands by murdering a fellow-citizen ? Anthony Cataldi of San Jose , who boasted , in an article which appeared in a number of newspapers the day after the California lynching , that he had rounded up the mob and had led them to the jail , has been arrested on information supplied by the American Civil Liberties Union . Governor Rolph , when informed of the arrest , declared he had not changed " one iota " his intention of pardoning anyone convicted of participation in the San Jose lynching . The man is incorrigible . It remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens of California to reelect him to the office which he has defamed . WE DO NOT RECALL a reform government in New York City which has been as well manned as Mr. LaGuardia 's new administration bids fair to be . The appointments made by him up to the time of our going to press are generally excellent . He has lived up to his promise to exclude politics , and in a number of instances has picked the best men available . Thus , to have induced Robert Moses , the successful and able chairman of the Long Island State Park Commission , to become head of New York City 's parks was a brilliant stroke of policy . To have induced A. A. Berle , Jr. , to take the position of City Chamberlain until such time as that needless office is abolished was another shrewd move , while the selection of William Hodson , for years a leading social worker , for Commissioner of Public Welfare has been universally praised . In picking General John F. O'Ryan to be his Police Commissioner , Mr. LaGuardia chose a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generals who were trained in the militia . A fine disciplinarian but never a militarist or a martinet , General O'Ryan 's selection is feared by the worthless elements among the police . But the appointment which pleases us most is that of Paul Blanshard as Commissioner of Accounts , which means Grand Inquisitor , since that office carries the right to delve into the affairs of all the others . Here Mr. Blanshard will be in his element , and he should succeed in painting an even more vivid picture of what Tammany has been doing to New York than did Samuel Seabury . THE ACQUITTAL of Athos Terzani , on trial for murder in New York City , shows what can be done to prevent the railroading for political reasons of an innocent man when an energetic effort is made sufficiently early . Ter-zani was arrested , after a shooting at a fascist meeting , upon the complaint of Art Smith of the discredited Khaki Shirts of America . Terzani , an anti-fascist , had previously accused one of Smith 's followers of the shooting and had shown the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong defense committee was organized for Terzani , and competent counsel was obtained , headed by Arthur Garfield Hays . At the trial not only was the prosecution discredited but the defense named the man it believed to have been the slayer and presented evidence to support the charge . It took the jury only thirty-two minutes to find Terzani not guilty . While Terzani 's acquittal is a credit to his defense committee and counsel , it reflects little luster upon the District Attorney of Queens County , who stood pat upon the original police version of the shooting and refused to follow up clues supplied by the defense . The much-vaunted Anglo-Saxon system of criminal justice works fairly well in many cases , but where political or class prejudice enters , it may easily make a victim of a man without money or friends . " p EACE ON EARTH , " the first production of the Theater Union , has been variously received by the critics of the New York press . It has been praised and condemned and ignored . The Nation 's critic found it obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste , it has been received with unanimous enthusiasm by great numbers of the people for whom it was primarily intended . Workers , students , radicals , pacifists have flocked to the Civic Repertory Theater and filled to capacity the lower-priced seats . Benefits and theater parties have been arranged by a united front of such diverse organizations as the International Labor Defense , the Marine ' Workers ' Industrial Union , branches of the Socialist Party , the League for Industrial Democracy , the New Workers ' School , and several more . Almost as great variety marks the management of the Theater Union organization . It is this surprisingly wide appeal that lends importance to the enterprise . For the Theater Union is the first venture of just this kind to be launched in New York . It is a non-profit organization , originally financed by individual contributions . It pays small salaries . If it should make any profit , half will go into a producing fund and half be divided among the actors and other workers in the Union . The price scale is from thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dollar . It will produce plays designed to appeal to working-class and radical audiences . Indeed , this is a working-class theater of the only sort that we believe in  --  one which is attended by workers because they like it and because they can afford to go . The unfortunate corollary to the encouraging fact of working-class support is that the Theater Union needs also , if it is to survive , the support of the people who can buy the higher-priced seats . And so far , it has not succeeded in filling its front rows . T HE hazards of the holiday gift season must have been considerably augmented this year by the happy department-store thought of providing " gift advisers " ? efficient persons who know just what to buy for Uncle Ned or Cousin Sue . If there is anything which we would open on Christmas morning with more trepidation than an infernal machine , it would be a package from Aunt Hannah selected by a " gift adviser .
