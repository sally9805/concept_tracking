IN THE American we speak now they would have called us a bum bunch of guys . But this was 1887 . I do n't know what words those dusty tourists in the stagecoaches ( whom we haughtily ignored ) applied to us when we met them on the road ; but we heard their sightseeing screams , we saw them stare and crane their tame citified necks after us . Had we been bears or bandits ( I am sure some of them took us for the latter ) they could n't have broken into more excitement . The bears in 1887 mostly kept themselves out of sight ; they had a justifiable distrust of human nature , at least the black bears and silver-tips had ; they had not yet learned that shooting in the Park was forbidden . But bandits you might see ? possibly ; there have been hold-ups in the Park . And there is no doubt that the Park with its violent phenomena could throw some visitors into a very special state of mind ; they became ready to expect anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were merely five white men and one Indian , on six horses , with eight packs , in Isingle file , riding at a walk , perfectly harm ' less , and as new to the Park as were the tourists who leaped from the stagecoaches to snapshot us . Variously scattered among these United States , our cavalcade may still be enshrined in albums of photographic souvenirs . Of course we were not the sort of spectacle you are likely to see , unless the circus or rodeo comes to I town . At the carton , a well-to-do youth whose acquaintance I had made the year before at Jackson in the White Mountains , recognized me , came up , shook my hand with solicitude , and said that if a hundred dollars would help . . . And they put us all safe and far at a side table at the Mammoth Springs , so as not to alarm the tourists . I find in my diary that my spurs jingled so boisterously upon the wooden floors in that hotel that I removed them , blushing the while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than I recollected of that first camping trip ; so novel , so vivid , so charged with adventure and delight and lusty vigor and laughter , that to think of it makes me homesick for the past ? and the past comes to be the mental home of those who can look back a long way . Weeks before we had excited the tourists , or washed our underwear in a geyser , other experiences had marked that summer as a high spot among holidays . George and I had swum naked in the quiet edge of the whirlpool below Niagara Falls ; we had ridden on the cowcatcher all through the mountain scenery of the Canadian Pacific ( you could n't do that now , the cowcatcher is shrunk to a mere shadow of its former self , but it 's the best seat in the train for a view ) . We had seen Seattle as a ragged village of one lumpy street and frame houses , reached by steamers alone ; a short railroad with a long title ? Seattle Lake Shore and Eastern ? carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by humorists ( I must suppose ) Stuck Junction . The University , into which I wandered through a wooden gate swung shut by a chain weighted by a tin can filled with stones , matched its large name as imperfectly as the railroad . In an upper room I found a blackboard and a stuffed owl ; and in this company sat a lone young woman reading Les Miserables . She asked me what the word in queer letters on a front page meant ; and I could tell her , because Greek was required when I entered Harvard . Presently followed seven glorious days and nights in San Francisco , the High Jinks of the Bohemian Club among the great redwoods ? but I am meandering ; I must get back to the one red man and the five whites and the Park . The red man was Tighee , a full-blooded Shoshone , speaking English incompletely , and seldom speaking at all . He was our huntsman . Two of the whites were cook , packer and horse wrangler ; we were the other three ; and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommending me to all officers of the Army . Thirty-six hours in the stage from Rawlins on the railroad to Fort Washakie on the Shoshone Indian reservation brought us to our point for outfitting . Once outfitted , we started northwestward , and reached Wind River the second day . And here goes my diary : " This afternoon George saw about six wild geese waddling about in a stream . He was desirous to test his horse 's taste for shooting , so he fired from the saddle , thereby adding one to the number of geese . Nobody hurt . " I had forgotten this . It was the Sheridan Trail we followed up Wind River . Four years before us , General Sheridan , with President Arthur and a large escort , had taken this same route . It was nothing but a trail ; solitary , wild , the Divide to our left , buttes and sagebrush to our right , and the streaming river beside us . Up the river 90 miles or so , and over a low part of the Continental Divide a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ventre into Jackson 's Hole , after lingering and killing bear and elk on the Divide . ( It was curious to ride by , in 1893 , the site of that camp twomiles down the Pacific side from the summit of the Divide , that place which had been our headquarters for ten days , and find the stakes we had stretched our bear hides on in 1887 still in the ground , not one missing . ) Again my diary : " Sunday , Aug. 21 . Camp 10 . Head of Jackson 's Lake , 7 p. m . Got here last night after 32 or 33 more miles . . . . The Tetons across the lake magnificent . I hunted all day for elk with Tighee-9 till 4 ? in cross timber . Awful . Tracks everywhere . Only 2 elk ? which I missed like a fool . Our friend the horse thief joined us yesterday . He turned out a harmless shepherd with a nice dog , who cats your supper when we are not looking . " Of course I had forgotten about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why forget the dog ? And here let me pause to lay my ineffectual but heartfelt curse upon the commercial vandals who desecrated the outlet of Jackson 's Lake with an ugly dam to irrigate some desert land away off in Idaho . As that lake used to be , it narrowed in a long bend by degrees , until placidly and imperceptibly it became once more the Snake River sliding out of it below as the Snake River had flowed into it above . Serenity and solitude everywhere ; antelope in herds like cattle in the open spread of sagebrush between Snake and the Tetons ; these rising from the dusky blur of pines to steeps of grass , slants of rock , streaks of snow like linen drying away up , and at last the far peaks . At sunset they turned lilac , and all their angles swam together in a misty blue . Just below the outlet among scattered pines near the river , an old cabin , gaping to the weather , roof going , each year a little less of a shelter , made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wilderness more present . And there among the brush was a tattered legend in print : " This very fine old rum is widely known . " This relic of man crashed into the quiet spell of nature not nearly so harshly as does that disgusting dam . There is more beauty in Jackson 's Hole than even such a beastly thing could kill ; but it has destroyed the august serenity of the lake 's outlet for ever ; and it has defaced and degraded the shores of the lake where once the pines grew green and dark . They stand now white skeletons , drowned by the rising level of the water . The Sheridan trail left the lake and the river and crossed three miles of level , turned up into timber , ran through a valley of young symmetric spruce like a nursery ; cold air came up to us from a stream flowing invisible in the depths of a little canon ; and by and bywe descended to a flat of thick willows that brushed your knees as the trail sneaked through them till you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met discipline and law at the sergeant 's cabin . Our packs were proud with trophies , heads and pelts ; lucky that we needed no more of these to justify our wild and predatory aspect and prove our competence with the rifle ; for here we crossed the sacred line , the southern boundary ( as it was then ) of the Park ; and all shooting must cease ; we had entered the sanctuary . The sergeant sealed our rifles . We took our way into the haunted land , the domain possessed of devils , shunned by the Indians of old . II Strange how readily the American mind swallows whole the promises in a political platform , and believes so little in any other statements , unless it is those of quack medicines ! Vesuvius and Aetna had been heard of in the United States , long before John Colter of the Lewis and Clark expedition came back from his wild explorations and told the people of St. Louis about the hissing and rumbling and boiling phenomena he had beheld during his wanderings in the region of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liar , and as a liar he passed for a matter of fifty years . During these , James Bridger got the same reputation . There 's not a doubt that other white men saw the wonders of that weird country during those fifty years . Their traces have been found . But they were Hudson Bay fur trappers , and because of the fur they kept the secret . Not until gold-seekers rushed into Montana and parties of them ( in 1863 ) actually saw much more of the wonders than even Colter had , were his words substantiated ? or they might have been had gold not so utterly obsessed the minds of these prospectors that they hardly noticed the geysers . It was in 1870 , through the official reports of a special expedition , that the whole country knew and believed for the first time that the hissing and boiling , with many other strange things , were no myth ? realized this too soon for vandal exploiters , like the builders of the Jackson Lake dam , to grab and spoil ; for the Government took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the recreation of the people . As we rode into it from the sergeant 's cabin through jack pines and fallen timber , at a walk , " haunted " did not seem a farfetched expression . Mud spots of odd hue and consistency were passed ; one 's horse went down into them deep and suddenly ; once through the trees we saw a little pond steaming ; stealthy , unusual smells prowled among the pines ; after skirting Lewis Lake , the trail diverged from where the present road runs north across the Divide to the Thumb , and after going northwest along Shoshone Lake , went over the Divide at a rockier place , and so down the Fire Hole River through the trees toward the geysers ; and my diary says : " The Basin came in sight over the treetops below us ? merely a litter of steamjets . It might have been Lowell . " Yes ; the prospect suggested to my modern mind a manufacturing center in full swing . No wonder those shooting columns of steam scared the Indians of old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , walls and roof ; and to sleep there must have madeyou intimately acquainted with how your neighbors were passing the night . We did n't sleep there , we camped within the trees a short ride away ; but we rejoiced in the blackberry brandy we bought from the hotel clerk ; it was provided to check disturbances which drinking queer water from highly chemical brooks often raised in human interiors . And we also rejoiced in a bath the soldiers had constructed in a cabin by the river . The cool river flowed into the wooden trough one way , and through another spout , which you let loose with a wooden peg , astonishingly hot water poured from a little boiling hole in the formation above the cabin , and brought your bath to the temperature you desired . Both brandy and bath were a source of rejoicing ; and after emerging clean and new from the latter , the spectacle of a little gray bird , like a fat catbird , skimming along the river like a bullet and suddenly dropping below the surface where it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticking out in the air , filled me with such elation that I forgot the geysers and watched him . Where it was deeper he would plunge wholly out of sight , run along submerged , reach a shallow place , with his tail again sticking out . Then he would take it into his head to float on top and swim . I came to know him well . In 1896 I took his photograph high among the Teton range . I was washing at the creek before breakfast . He was sitting on a stone covered with snow in the middle of the creek , singing blithely : the water ouzel . But I do not think that anybody there rejoiced quite as utterly as a boy employed in the hotel . He must have been somewhere in his ' teens ; he was like the true love in " Twelfth Night " that could sing both high and low . In calm moments he would answer you in a deep bass . In excitement , into which he periodically fell , the bass cracked to a wild treble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day no bell was there , but the boy hoppeda good deal . We would be sitting tilted back , reading our mail , the tourists would have ceased talking and be lounging drowsily , the boy would be at the door , motionless as a set steel trap . Suddenly the trap would spring , the boy would catapult into the door , and in his piping treble scream out : " Beehive 's a-goin ' off ! " at which every tourist instantly started from his chair , and a leaping crowd gushed out of the hotel and sprinted down over the formation to catch the Beehive at it . Beehive finally quiescent , they returned slowly , sank into chairs and exhausted silence ; you could have heard a mosquito . But the steel trap was again set , sprang soon , and again the silence was pierced : " There goes Old Faithful ! " Up and out they flew once more , watched Old Faithful , and came back to their chairs and to silence more exhausted . Was the boy exhausted ? Never . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grotto ? whatever it might be , that pre-Ritz-Carlton bell hop routed those torpid tourists from their repose to set them trooping across the formation to gape at some geyser in action , and again seek their chairs , feebler each time . Has he in his mature years ever known more joy ? I doubt it . An Englishman , who sat with me ( it may have been that year or a later one ) on the hotel 's narrow porch , had evidently had his credulity so distorted by the freaks of nature he had seen that everything amazed him . Had I seen any gray geese ? Yes , I had . But large flocks ? Well , I did n't know . " There are large flocks of them , sir , Gray geese . Large flocks . God bless my soul ! I saw them yesterday . " And just about then , Old Faithful played . " How high do you take that column of water to be ? " I told him the number of feet I had been told : " Dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand that ridge over there is the Continental Divide ? " I believed it was . " Well , sir , are you aware that the Continental Divide is some six thousand-andodd feet high , and that geyser is rising into the sky clear above that ridge ? " My diary : " Friday , August 26 . Washing clothes at a small geyser . . . . We steep the garment in a quiet blue pool , deep , and shaped exactly like a great calla lily , filled to the brim and some ten feet across . Then we soap and then with a pole poke it down a spluttering crevice that foams all over it until it is ready to take out and dry . " Have you ever soaped a geyser ? Then you know it is true . If you have not you may think I am taking advantage of your credulity . Science explains the matter ; I need not . But to soap a geyser is very bad for it ; disturbs its rhythm , dislocates its circulation , makes it play when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geyser , I have heard . Before 1887 , and before the effect of soap on geysers was widely known , a Chinaman had set up a laundry above an unemployed and inconspicuous vent in the formation at the Upper Geyser Basin . Hot water boiled in the vent , steam rose from it day and night , and the Chinaman was happy in the thought of needing neither fire nor stove nor pots , since he had taken Mother Nature into partnership , and she would wash his linen with her own hands . A few seconds after the first bundle of soaped clothes was stirred into the vent out jumped the geyser , hissing and spitting , and away blew the roof . The Chinaman escaped . That is the story ; and early in my western adventures , when what they were telling me grew very remarkable , I always said , " Let me assure you that I make it a rule to believe everything I hear . " But when they told me of a hole into which you could toss your soiled handkerchief and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ironed , folded , and with a laundry mark , I drewthe line . That Chinaman in 1887 had an establishment behind the hotel , where I saw the huge unnatural cucumbers he had raised with the help of hot moisture from the bowels of the earth ; but his laundry was now beside , not above , Mother Nature 's boiling water . By the time I had camped several times through the Park the uncertain temper of these bubbling holes had been more generally rumored . Not far from the Mud Geyser one day , I was passing a little girl who was poking one of them about the size of a soup plate with a stick , when a loud voice , which I presume was her mother 's , shouted behind me : " Louisa , quit fooling with that thing or it 'll bustl " Why will people scrawl their silly names on the scenery ? Why thus disclose to thousands who will read this evidence that you are a thoughtless ass ? All very well if you wrote your name , your address , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it in some wholly accessible spot where your presence represents no daring , no endurance , nothing but the necessary cash to go there ? Around the base of Old Faithful ( for example ) are little scoops in the formation , little shallow white saucers into which the hot water has flowed and remained . Well , beneath the water on the bottom of these saucers the names of asses were to be seen , written in pencil . I doubt if this often happens nowadays ; it does n't pay . It was a deep satisfaction to talk of the vandals with Major Harris , or Captain Boutelle , or George Anderson , or Jack Pitcher , military commandants of the Park before it was turned over to the Department of the Interior . The opinions they variously expressed about those who defaced nature were to the point . And they devised punishment for the offenders before punishment was provided by law . The soldiers patrolled the places where vandalism was likely to occur . If they caught a tourist writing on the formation or breaking it off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and give up the specimen . If they found a name after its writer had gone on they rode after him and brought him back to rub it out . It has happened that a man , having completed the round of the Park , has been about to take the train when his name , discovered on the formation by a soldier and telephoned to the Mammoth Springs , has led to its being duly and fittingly effaced by himself , escorted back clean across the Park . Captain Edwards ( not a commandant , but on duty there in 1891 ) told me this : A soldier at the Upper Basin had reported a clergyman as having broken off a bagful of formation . Edwards found him seated in the stage , about to depart from the Fountain . " You have taken no specimens of course ? " " No . " " You give me your word as a preacher of the Gospel that you have nothing of the sort in that bag ? " " I do . " Edwards let him go . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humiliate a minister in front of the crowd . " Boutelle had a hard time to stop a commercial clique from installing an elevator at the Lower Falls . Politics was behind it , as usual . To put a lot of machinery by those Falls at the head of that canon , where the sublime merges with the exquisite , and which alone is worth crossing the continent to see , would have been an outrage more abominable than the dam at Jackson Lake . " But why should your refined taste , " objected a lover of the multitude to whom I told this , " interfere with the enjoyment of the plain people ? " " Have the plain people told you or anybody that the one thing they lie sleepless craving for is an elevator to go up and down by those falls the way they do in hotels ? " " They would like it if it was there . " " Of course they would . Is that a reason to vulgarize a supreme piece of wild natural beauty for all time ? How are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you lower to their level everything above it ? " But who could convince a female phi-lanthropist ? The would-be exploiter of the Park never dies . It may be a railroad , a light and power company ? anything . It is a ceaseless menace , invariably supported by plausible argument and political influence . Had the language of the original act setting the Park aside in 1872 for the benefit and enjoyment of the people been so phrased as to bar exploiters as it was phrased to protect the game and fish from capture or destruction " for the purposes of merchandise and profit , " safety from the despoiler would be better assured . Boutelle staved off the exploitation during his term as commandant . But George Anderson related many tales of poachers and attempted exploitation . None of them was quite so evil as the way the army canteen was abolished ; but as that concerns not the Park , but the enlisted man , and a clique of distillers , and the Federated Spinsters of Uplift , it does not belong here ; I doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday , August 29 . West , George Norman , and I are having a hell of a time trying to get down to the bottom of the canon with ropes .. . . I am at present sitting about nowhere , halfway .. George is above , undecidedwhether he 'll untie the rope from the last tree , or not . " As I read this over ? it was written fortynine years ago ? West 's remarks at various stages of our descent come back to me : ( 1 ) that he would give ten dollars not to have started , ( 2 ) that he would give fifty , ( 3 ) that he had n't enough cash in the world to give what he 'd like to . We got all the way down and back without hurt . It was somewhere between Inspiration Point and the Falls . Farther down there 's no trouble , there 's a trail to the water , where you can catch trout . III When we returned to the Park in 1896 many changes had occurred in it since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road now went from the Upper Basin to the Thumb , no longer ( as we had gone then ) from the Lower Basin up Nez Puce Creek and over the Divide by Mary 's Mountain along Trout Creek in the Hayden Valley to the Yellowstone River between the Mud Geyser and the Sulphur Mountain . There you met the road between the Callon and the Thumb ; and the hotel at the Cation could easily have been dropped whole into the great reception room of the present hotel there . Its site was not at all the same ? it was about at the junction of the road to Norris ; it had but one storey , and its shape reminded you of a bowling alley or a shooting gallery . We did n't go to the Lake in 1887 . I have often seen it since , and once camped and fished at the outlet for a number of days . Not much to record of that , except the occasional wormy trout ? you know them by their feeble fight , their unwholesome color , and their emaciation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar to the waters of the Yellowstone Lake , I never caught any elsewhere than in the Lake or the river below it ) and the reprehensible conduct of the sea gulls one day : that is unforgettable . I was catching many fish and cleaning them , and the cleanings attracted some dozen gulls . They hovered in the air , swooped on the guts I cut out of each trout , gobbled them and were ready for more . There was a young gull among them , and he was never quick enough for his parents , or his uncles , or his aunts . They always got there first , sometimes only a second ahead of him , snapped it from under his callow beak , and left him sadder and sadder . At length in pity I threw a large meal close to him ; he got it , made off along the shore by himself a little way , and had it partially swallowed , when an adult relative spied it , dashed down , dragged it out of his poorlittle throat , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a parlor car . He threw his head up to the sky , beat his wings , shut his eyes , opened his beak , and bawled and bawled . Long before 1896 the hotels were larger , and the education of the bears had begun . They were now aware that man did not shoot them and they had discovered that campers carried good things to eat . One night in 189/ our sleep was murdered by sudden loud rattling and clashing of our tin plates and other hardware . We rushed out of the tent into silence and darkness . In the morning our sugar sack lay wounded , but still with us . Macbeth while dragging at it had tumbled the hardware about him . He was not educated enough to stand that and had taken to the woods . Another bear took to a tree that week . As dusk was descending , campers found him in suspicious proximity to their provender and raised a shout . The shouting brought us and others not to the rescue , but to the highly entertaining spectacle of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bear sitting philosophically above their din . Night came on , the campers went to bed , and the hear went away . Many years have now gone since the bears discovered the treasures that are concealed in the garbage piles behind the hotels . I walked out once in the early evening at the Lake hotel and counted twenty-one bears feasting . I saw a bear march up to a tourist and accept candy from his hand , while his wife stood at a safe distance , protesting vainly , but I think rightly . I saw the twenty-one bears suddenly cease feasting and withdraw to a short distance . Out of the trees came a true grizzly , longsnouted and ugly ; and while he selected his dinner with ostentatious care and began to enjoy it , a cinnamon bear stole discreetly , as if on tip-toe , toward the meal he had left behind him . He got pretty near it , when the grizzly paused in eating and merely swung his head at him ? no more than that ; in a flash the cinnamon had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back presently ; and the scene was re-enacted three times before I had enough of it and left ; each time when the cinnamon had reached a certain point the grizzly swung his head , and this invariably sufficed . It is my notion that the cinnamon was a bit of a wag . As our outfit rode into the Mammoth Springs , Tighee at sight of the hotel made ( I think ) his first remark that day : " All same one big mountain . " What would he have said to the present hotel ? It dwarfs the old one , which is where the stage-drivers and various employees live ? or did on my last visit there in 1916 . What would he have said about the Old Faithful Inn , which has long replaced that primitive canvas affair where the blackberry brandy and the bell-hop once flourished , and the Englishman had been amazed at the gigantic height of Old Faithful in action , and the flocks of gray geese ? These birds have amazed me , but not in the same way . Dawn after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two of us left warm beds for the freezing air , and crawled like turtles towards a flat where the geese were feeding . We sneaked along , so close to the cold earth that the brush hid the geese from us . Every day the flock saw us first , flapped up far out of range , and departed . I am certain that they had a sentinel posted and enjoyed us as the cinnamon did the grizzly . " To call these birds geese , " I said to my companion , " is an outrage . " " Or rather , " he corrected me , " the term is misapplied to foolish persons . " What do you think of that ? Upon another occasion , while at breakfast , I contemplated a pot of preserves made in Dundee , and remarked : " Who could have expected orange marmalade to come from Scotland ? " And he explained : " They import the oranges , you know . " Eight weeks of that . It came near to aging me . Something worse ? no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks . I can not tell if Tighee would have treated us so had we taken him away from the beaten track . We never did , in the Park or out of it ; for though we had hunted and fished in a virtually untenanted wilderness , the Sheridan Trail ran through it , familiar ground to Tighee ; and in the Park we followed the conventional route and visited none except the regulation sights . But with Dick Washakie ( our hunter on this later excursion , another full-blooded Shoshone , who spoke a little more English , having once been at the Carlisle school ) we struck off the beaten trail . I was anxious to get mountain sheep after visiting the geysers and Canon ; so I turned our backs on the known and our faces to the unknown , using maps , and no longer consulting Dick Washakie about where we should go next . I wished if it were possible to get into the high country eastward , where three ranges of mountains may be said to collide and produce steep and complicated results , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning ? we were nowhere near the high country yet ? West came and told me Dick Washakie was leaving us . So I went to him . His horse was packed . Nothing availed . Not our predicament , not the wages he would lose , nothing . He gave so many reasons ? his father was old ? he must cut his hay ? I forget the rest ? that I knew he never gave the real one . A previous experience with another Indian , Paul La Rose , made me certain that West had guessed right : they distrusted country where they had never been . With Paul La Rose we had forded Snake below the outlet . He objected to fording it at all . At every step we took on the far side he objected more . I kept on . From the Sheridan trail on the east side of Snake . 1 had stared too many days across the spread of land at the Tetons : I intended to get dose to them . We should find no water , said Paul . Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must melt and feed some creek at the base of those big mountains . We 'd better turn back , said Paul . We 'll go on , Paul . Well , you 'll have dry camp to-night . Paul , we 'll go on . You take the lead then . Hedropped sulkily away from the head of our procession , I took his place , and in about an hour we heard the quiet sound of a waterfall and came to an opening in the narrow belt of pines to which I headed , and found the stream that flows between Leigh 's and Jenny 's Lake . At that campwe fishedand hunted for a week in solitude unbroken . That was 1888 . Since then the dude ranch has been established in that country , Snake is bridged . But Dick Washakie 's desertion changed our plans ; we needed a hunter . We renounced that high country where the mountain ranges collide and journeyed back into the known ; and so began my acquaintance with Yancey . Yancey was of that frontier type which is no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Sam type . He and his cabins had been there a long while . The legend ran that he was once a Confederate soldier , and had struck out from the land of the Lost Cause quite unreconstructed , and would never wear blue jeans because blue reminded him of the Union army . He was known as Uncle John by that whole country . One of his cabins was a rough wayside inn for miners traveling between Cinnabar and Cooke City at the northeastern edge of the Park . Yancey did not talk much to mere people ; and I should have been mere people to him , but that I knew Boies Penrose ( later Senator from Pennsylvania ) , who had camped more than once on Hell Roaring Creek nearby , and for whose good shooting , fishing , and horsemanship the old timer had warn ' respect . He unbent at the name of Penrose . What could he do for me ? I told him of our hunterless plight . James Woody was due to-morrow . He would guide us to a sheep country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? nothis wine , but his whisky cellar . Handsome barrels . I came to know it well . He had some sort of fermented stuff made from oranges , which he obtained from California . Mingled properly with whisky , the like of It I have never elsewhere tasted . Woody did n't want to go . He was waiting to join Theodore Roosevelt ; but on Yancey 's persuasion he would go with us , leave us where sheep were to be expected , and send Donohue in his stead . I had no money for wages here ; it was in a safe at Fort Washakie , where I had expected to pay Dick off . I wrote East and , just like a play , an old Cinnabar acquaintance of 1887 turned up and was glad to convey the letter to the mail . Joe Keeney was his name , and we became acquainted thus : My diary , Sept. 1 : " A lucky chance made us cared for at Cinnabar . When we were some 500 yards from it ( it is merely a railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheds ) a little child passed us full tilt . As there was a ranch behind us we did not stop her , but supposed she was going there . Then far ahead we saw a mart beckoning violently . When we came to him he said , ' Damn it , I signalled to head her off . ' ' Well , I did n't see you . Get on my horse and go after her . ' Which he did , catching her and bringing her back in his arms . It appeared he had sent her with a message to some men in a buggy whowere stopping at the ranch but started away before she could get to them . ' And she 'd have run till she ran them down in the mountains , ' her parent added . He turned out to be the landlord , Joe Keeney , who became our friend , gave us drinks , and turned his family out of their room and made us sleep in it . " Joe Keeney rode off from Yancey 's with my letter under his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woody guided us to the Hoodoos ( which are pillared erosions of sandstone , and look like a church organ that has met with a railroad accident ) ; Donohue arrived in his place and took us to Saddle Mountain ; I got a black tail , but never a sheep , nothing of interest save petrified fragments of wood and seashells lying over a region at present six or seven thousand feet above sea level ; we returned to Yancey 's where a letter was put in my hand . It was muddy . It was my own . Joe Keeney must have scratched his head on the way to Gardner ( to which the railroad had now been extended from Cinnabar ) . I was penniless . As I lay in camp in the meadows toward Baronet 's bridge next morning , Yancey came by . " What can I do for you ? " " Whisky and that orange shrub . And lend me a hundred dollars . " He did . Back home , I sent him a flask engraved " John Yancey , from the Dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Livingston the next autumn when I stopped off with the skins of white goat I had shot in the mountains of Washington territory . Those skins increased his respect for me ; we went to a show that evening , and through the night I was introduced , I think , to the whole town , male and female . In these days , the Park bear has almost completed his education . His children for generations have known the way to the garbage pile . And all have learned the hour when the train of stages passes along the road through the various woods . Along the road they wait , begging ; and the tourists place chocolate and other dainties in their paws and maws . They have gone on the dole . The one step remaining is for them to take charge of the hotels and expel the management . Yancey is gone , Beaver Dick is gone ; awake at night sometimes , the tide of streamline thought sets West , and I recall that porcupine tastes like roast pig it was a hornets ' nest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the dutch oven fell off first and he bounced down through the timber with the tin plates rolling every which way the roll of bedding stuck in a bush but you get tired of trout we caught little minnows thick as mosquitoes in a net in that camp above Jenny 's Lake for white bait I should n't want to see Brook 's Lake now any fool can go along the road in a car and find his way there just below was where we clubbed those young geese they could n't fly yet swimming Wind River was just a creek very good tender eating so was the sand hill crane Copley Amory shot but not like the young geese the white columbine at that camp larger than the garden sort and there was a white swan out on the lake gosh how good it used to be to swab up the melted lard off your tin plate with a lump of bread and swallow it was it wild carrots or parsnips that would poison gosh those miles of flowers in the big meadow below the scoop in the rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross the Divide .. , and so on , and so on .
