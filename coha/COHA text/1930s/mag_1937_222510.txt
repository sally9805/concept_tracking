Assembled in Pittsburgh 's Hotel William Penn for a four-day convention last week was the National Association of Purchasing Agents , a close-knit organization with more of the attributes of a professional than of a business body . As individuals , purchasing agents seldom make news . In the corporate hierarchy they are usually obscured by the dazzle of the sales department , the impressive spectacle of production , even by the methodical researchers . Only at Christmas does the purchasing agent come into his own . Then he is showered with gifts ( usually returned ) from the host of salesmen who want to keep or gain his favor . <P> Yet in convention assembled the purchasing agents were covered last week by crack by-line business writers from the country 's leading dailies . For U. S. purchasing agents buy as much as $20,000,000,000 worth of goods per year , much of it months in advance , and their opinions of prices , values and trends are never lightly taken . Hard-boiled realists , the terror of high-pressure salesmen , immune to all except factual advertising , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One error in purchasing judgment may mean to a corporation the difference between profit and loss. * <P> Not all the convention was given over to economic crystal-gazing . The purchasing agents heard Neil Carothers , Director of Lehigh University 's College of Business Administration , pronounce Recovery " irresistible . " ' ' We have a tough economic system , " said Dr. Carothers . " It had to be tough or we would not have survived the last seven years of Depression and the New Deal . " The New Deal was also kicked around by Editor J. H. Van Deventer of The Iron Age . Cracked he : " William Jennings Bryan held that it was impossible to make men out of monkeys through the operation of natural laws . Today , some of us are beginning to believe that the reverse process , at least is practicable , and that monkeys are now being made out of men through the operation of unnatural laws . " <P> In their off time the purchasing agents toured Pittsburgh 's steel district , roaring at a record 96% capacity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Q. Forrest Walker , economist to Manhattan 's R. H. Macy &; Co . For the next president of N. A. P. A. they picked George P. Brockway , bespectacled pur chasing agent for American Optical Co . But for most of the 1,382 purchasing agents who jampacked the William Penn for the biggest banquet in its history , the high point of the convention was the report of the business survey committee , headed by Frederick J. Heaslip of Fair banks Morse &; Co . A synthesis of best purchasing agent opinion , the report was simply a detailed business forecast to be used as a guide to buying policy in the next six months .
