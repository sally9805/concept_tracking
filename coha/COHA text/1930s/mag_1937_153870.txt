Though most people think they feel sympathy for human wretchedness , it is a remarkable fact that present-day proletarian paintings are in general formalized , strained and snide . Painters like the late George Luks and George Bellows could make an old applewoman look pathetic ; young painters nowadays are more likely to make her look depraved . Somewhere between pathos and depravity lies the truth which would arouse fear and pity . For various reasons-preoccupation with design , premature austerity , honorable anger or plain bad draughtsmanship-few modern artists touch that particular truth . <P> This week , at the Hudson D. Walker Gallery in Manhattan , critics inspected the work of a young man from Baltimore who seemed to be getting warm . Mervin Jules , 25 , does not yet wear the mantle of Daumier ( see col. 3 ) , but among his 20 tempera paintings and score of gouaches ( opaque water colors ) there were several which allowed spectators not only to see poverty but to see into it . Several others showed a spirit and skill at caricature which located Jules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other effective satirists of social horrors . <P> Said John Sloan four years ago : " Painting . . . has been getting sicker and sicker for over 100 years . The ultra moderns will cure it . " Signs of such a cure were evident in devices of composition which Mervin Jules has apparently borrowed from trick photography and the fantastic school , used for his own purposes . <P> Art followers could also take pleasure in Artist Jules 's restrained , luminous color . Best pictures : Little Tailor , showing , through the huge foreground frame of a sewing machine , a pallid gnome bent over his stitching ; Mine Baseball , in which the figures of the players are dark on a field yellow with late afternoon sunlight against a dark background of mine breakers and hills ; Jury , whose procession of fat and lean brainless bourgeois figures directly recalled Daumier 's treatments of the same subject ; The Liberals , which presents , out on a limb , the Scientist , the Man who Sees Both Sides , the Indecisive Man , the Scholar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man who Waits for the Right Time , while red-bannered masses see the forward and underneath ( see cut ) . <P> Mervin Jules was about 18 before he discovered he could draw . His family wanted him to be a cellist and for seven years he studied to be one . Then he got a scholarship to the Maryland Institute of Fine and Practical Arts , supported himself by waiting on customers in his uncle 's clothing store . In 1933 Manhattan 's Art Students ' League gave him a librarian 's job which paid for his tuition and he lived on $8.50 a week that winter , while working under Thomas Benton . <P> Back in Baltimore he worked part-time as a cutter in a men 's suit factory , helped organize the Artists ' Union . Blond , stocky , bespectacled Artist Jules came to Manhattan last July and clubbed with two artist friends to rent two big studio rooms in a gloomy building on lower Fifth Avenue . Jules does the cooking for all three . They own a rickety 1927 Chrysler , can not afford a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
