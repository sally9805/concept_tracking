Five years ago , before the cry of the jitterbug was heard in the land , a boyish , exuberant Frenchman was busy filling a medieval French castle with hot phonograph records by U.S. jazz players . The Frenchman , Hugues Panassi , had never seen a U.S. jazz orchestra in the flesh . But what he heard on records convinced him : 1 ) that jazz was a very important type of music , 2 ) that the difference between good and bad jazz was worth serious critical consideration , 3 ) that this difference depended not on how jazz was written but on how it was played . To drive his points home , Connoisseur Panassi wrote a book called Le Jazz Hot which , translated into English , promptly became the swing fan 's bible . <P> Last week Swing Fan Panassi arrived in Manhattan on his first visit to the U.S. After skimming the cream of Manhattan 's swing spots , Pundit Panassie concluded that the U.S. , Manhattan , and Manhattan 's Harlem were " marvelous , " but that " jeeterbogs " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concert of jazz music was a " seely idea , " that the rising generation of " cats " are mere kittens compared with the classic Louis Armstrong , " Bix " Beiderbecke and " Fots Wallair . " His present favorites : Count Basic at the Famous Door , Sidney Bechet and Zutie Singleton , whose jamming is a nightly feature at Nick 's Tavern , Manhattan .
