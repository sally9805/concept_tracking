The first Popular Front Government , organized as such , in the history of the Americas was inaugurated fortnight ago in a simple , one-minute ceremony when Chile 's President-elect Pedro Aguirre Cerda put on a tricolored sash , symbol of his office . No heart- &-soul; revolutionary like Mexico 's President Lazaro Cardenas , President Aguirre is a top-flight lawyer , a member of the Radical Party and a millionaire landowner . <P> Unlike most Chilean landowners , who have controlled Chile for decades , he is bent on improving the lot of the country 's underpaid , overworked rotos . To do this he lined up his Radicals with the Socialists , Radical Socialists and Communists , took the field against the landlordly Rightists . Infuriated with Rightist President Arturo Alessandri for suppressing their Putsch last September , 15,000 Nacistas ( Nazis ) on the eve of the election joined the Popular Front 's political hodgepodge , helped Lawyer Aguirre win by a slim 3,000 majority . <P> Despite this puree of parties and conflicting internal programs , the winning ticket last week got off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) pardoned all Nacistas arrested for their abortive Putsch ; 2 ) demanded and got the resignations of seven top-rank army leaders , among them the commander-in-chief as well as the head of the civil guards responsible for the bloody suppression of the Nacistas ; 3 ) received the routine resignations of 15 ambassadors ; 4 ) submitted to the Chamber of Deputies a decree permitting former President Alessandri to leave Chile for " a rest " in Europe , despite a Constitutional requirement that the old President remain in Chile until six months after termination of office ; 5 ) considered recognition of the Soviet Union ; 6 ) put into effect a nationwide reduction in bread prices ; 7 ) raised hours of employment of Federal workers to eight a day ; 8 ) ruled that Cabinet Ministers must spend three hours each day receiving the public in order " to keep in touch with the masses " ; 9 ) gave tacit approval to the appointment of a Communist as Mayor of Valparaiso , a Socialist as Mayor of Vina del Mar . <P> Despite the new Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one knew just how far the Popular Front would go with a revolutionary program of social reform . Popular Frontists , 80,000 strong , jammed Santiago 's new National Stadium to demonstrate for Loyalist Spain and greet Indaledo Prieto , former Loyalist defense minister who had made a special trip to be at the Aguirre Cerda inaugural . But reports of a Rightist Putsch to regain control lost in the close election continued to buzz through the country . <P> It was known that the defeated Rightist candidate , on his way to Europe , stopped off in Buenos Aires to confer with General Carlos Ibez , onetime Strongman of Chile , who was implicated in the Nacista uprising and is regarded by some Rightists as their white hope for another revolt . At week 's end , back to Chile flew General Ibanez , presumably with President Aguirre 's permission . He was welcomed by several thousand cheering Nacistas in their green shirts and military caps .
