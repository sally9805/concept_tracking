txt Promoters of the Grand National Treasure Hunt were barred from the use of the mails under a fraud order issued today by Acting Postmaster General W. W. Howes on the recommendation of Karl A. Crowley , solicitor for the Postoffice Department , based on evidence produced at hearings held here last week . Mr. Crowley held that violations of the postal fraud and lottery statutes had been sustained against the Grand National Treasure Hunt , Grand National Treasure Hunt , Inc. ; Grand National Treasure Hunt Contest , Association for Legalizing American Lotteries , Inc. ; George E. Fraser , distributor ; Ward &; Belford , Morse Gordon , and Steinberg &; Weinberg of New York . The activities upon which the charges were based were declared to have been conducted by the Association for Legalizing American Lotteries , headed by Major Thomas G. Lanphier , and the Grand National Treasure Hunt , of which Martin A. Hirsch is the president , the officers of both concerns having " worked in close association in the conduct of the scheme , " according to Mr. Crowley . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail in connection with the scheme by the others named in the citations . Upholds Charge on Tickets The first and second " contests " held under auspices of the Grand National Treasure Hunt were held to be " nothing more than guessing contests . " The third , or " current , " contest , closing April 11 , 1935 , employed tickets , the title and design of which , the ruling stated , left no doubt that the intention of the promoters , although denied by them , was to simulate the tickets issued by the Irish ' Free State Hospitals Sweepstakes , so that purchasers would believe it to be a similar scheme . " Aside from this motive , the necessit7 for Ithe employment of the ticket in this scheme is not apparent since the ticket is not a ' membership ' ticket in the Association for Legalizing American Lotteries , " Mr. Crowley stated . " It is only an ' application for membership . ' " Reviewing the findings of the inspectors who investigated the scheme , Mr , Crowley said that Mrs. Oliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first " contest , " told them that she examined " only about four of the answers to the cartoons and that was the extent of her judgment . " Abe Lyman , Jack Dempsey and Major Lanphier were the other judges , and the latter testified that he did most of the work of judging the contest , the other judges agreeing to the selections made by himself and Mrs. Harriman . In connection with the second contest , Mr. Crowley reported that " it is interesting to note that the winner of the first prize was Irene Varga , who told the inspector that she ' had a dream , or went into a trance , and while in the trance con- centrated and the names of the pictures came to her . ' " It is my opinion that Miss Varga , in having a dream or a trance and concentrating on the names of the pictures as they came into her subconscious mind , found about as sound a rule as could be adopted for the selection of the best and most appropriate titles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor the third ' contest ' did the promoters solicit or obtain any ruling from this office respecting the mailability of matter relating thereto under the lottery statute , " according to Mr. Crowley . However , on Jan. 14 , 1936 , they were advised by the postmaster at New York in connection with submission of circulars containing the conditions of the current contest that " as the rules are identical with those of the previous contest conducted by you , which were approved by the Solicitor for the Postoffice Department , matter relating thereto will be accepted for mailing . " " The respondents contend that this letter constitutes an approval by the Postoffice Department of the scheme now being conducted through the mails as herein described , " Mr. Crowley continued . " This letter does not constitute an approval as to the legality of conducting this scheme through the use of the mails of the United States . " The evidence before me shows , and I so find , that the evidence sustains in every particular and in every respect the charges filed in this case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is a gift enterprise and scheme for the distribution of money by chance and for obtaining money through the ' mails by means of false or fraudulent pretenses , representations and promises .
