HAD been at work a year gathering and I sifting materials for my " History of the Standard Oil Company " ? which was to appear in McClure 's Magazine ? before the series was announced . Very soon after that , Mr. McClure dashed into the office one day to tell me he had just been talking with Mark Twain who said his friend , Henry Rogers , at that time the most conspicuous man in the Standard Oil group , had asked him to find out what kind of a history of the concern McClure 's proposed to publish . " You will have to ask Miss Tarbell , " Mr. McClure told him . " Would Miss Tarbell see Mr. Rogers ? " Mark Twain asked . Mr. McClure was sure I would not ask anything better , which was quite true . And so an interview was arranged for one day early in January of 1902 at Mr. Rogers ' home , then at 26 East 57th Street . I was a bit scared at the idea . I had met many kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Industry . Was I putting my head into a lion 's mouth ? I did not think so . It had become more and more evident to me that any attempt to bite our heads off would be the stupidest thing the Standard Oil Company could do , their reputation being what it was . They were not that stupid , I told myself . However , it was one thing to tackle the Standard Oil Company in documents , as I had been doing ( studying the records of all the investigations and law cases in which the Company had been involved ) , quite anotherthing to meet it face to face . And then would Mr. Rogers " come across " ? Could I talk with him ? So far my attempts to talk with members of the organization had been failures . I had been met with that formulated chatter which is used by those who have accepted a creed , a situation , a system , to baffle the investigator trying to find out what it all means . My nervousness and my skepticism fell away when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was frank and hearty . Plainly he wanted me to be at ease . In that way he knew that he could soon tell whether it was worth his while to spend further time on me or not . Henry Rogers was a man of about sixty at this time , a striking person , by all odds the handsomest and most distinguished figure in Wall Street . He was tall , muscular , lithe as an Indian . There was a trace of the early oil adventurer in his bearing in spite of his air of authority , his excellent grooming , his manner of the quick-witted naturally adaptable man who has seen much of people . His big head with its high forehead was set off by a heavy shock of beautiful gray hair ; his nose was aquiline , sensitive . The mouth , which I fancy must have been flexible , capable both of firm decision and gay laughter , was concealed by a white drooping mustache . His eyes were large and dark , narrowed a little by caution , capable of blazing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyebrows giving distinction and force to his face . I remember thinking as I tried to get my bearings , Now I understand why Mark Twain likes him so much . They are alike even in appearance . They have the bond of early similar experiences ? Mark Twain in Nevada , Henry Rogers in the early oil regions . " " When and where did your interest in oil begin ? " Mr. Rogers asked as he seated me ? a full light on my face , I noticed . " On the flats and hills of Rouseville , " I told him . " Of course , " he cried , " of course . Tarbell 's Tank Shops . I knew your father . I could put . my finger on the spot where those shops stood . " We were off . We forgot our serious business and talked of our early days on the Creek . Mr. Rogers told me how the news of the oil excitement had drawn him from his boyhood home in New England , how he had found his way into Rouseville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his first thousand dollars into a home on the hillside adjoining ours . " It was a little white house , " he said , " with a high-peaked roof . " " Oh , I remember it , " I cried , " the prettiest house in the world I thought it . " It was my first approach to the Gothic arch . We reconstructed the geography of our neighborhood , lingering over the charm of the narrow ravine which separated our hillsides , a path on each side . " Up that path , " Mr. Rogers told me , " I used to carry our washing every Monday morning and go for it every Saturday night . Probably I 've seen you hunting flowers on your side of the ravine . How beautiful it was ; I was never happier . " Could two strangers , each a little wary of the other , have had a more auspicious beginning for a serious talk ? ? for what followed was serious with moments of strain . " What are you basing your story on ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the South Improvement Company . " He broke in to say , " Well , that of course was an outrageous business . Thatis where the Rockefellers made their big mistake . " I knew of course that Mr. Rogers had fought that early raid tooth and nail , but I knew also that later he had joined " the conspirators , " as the Oil Regions called them , in carrying out point by point the initial program . But I did not throw it up to him . " Why did you not come to us at the start ? " Mr. Rogers asked . " It was unnecessary , you have written your history ; besides it would have been quite useless , " I told him . " We 've changed our policy , " he said . " We are giving out information . " As a matter of fact Mr. Rogers may be regarded I think as the first Public Relations Counsel of the Standard Oil Company ? the forerunner of Ivy Lee , as I , so far as 1 knew , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the close to two hours I spent that afternoon with Henry Rogers we went over the history of the oil business . We talked of rebates and pipes lines , independent struggles and failures , the absorption of everything that touched their ambition . He put their side to me , the mightiness of their achievement , the perfection of their service . Also he talked of their trials , their persecution , as he called it , by their rivals , the attack on the Standard Oil Company by Henry Dcmarest Lloyd in Wealth Against Common-wealth . " I never understood how Harper could have published that book . Why I knew Harry Harper socially . " " There has always been something , " he said a little ruthfully . " Look at things now ? Russia and Texas . There seems to be no end of the oil they have there . How can we control it ? It looks as if something had the Standard Oil Company by the neck , something bigger than we are . " The more we talked the more at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . It was almost like talking to Mr. McClure and Mr. Phillips . Finally we made a compact . I was to take up with him each case in their history as I came to it . He was to give me documents , figures , explanations , and justifications ? anything and everything which would enlarge my understanding and judgment . I realized how big a contribution he would make if he continued to be as frank as he was in this preliminary talk . I made it quite clear to him , however , that while I should welcome anything in the way of information and explanation that he could give , it must be my judgment , not his , which prevailed . " Of course , Mr. Rogers , " I told him , " I realize that my judgments may not stand in the long run , but I shall have to stand or fall by them . " " Well , " he said as I rose to go , " I suppose we 'll have to stand it . Would you be willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be a little more convenient . " " Certainly , " I replied . He looked a bit surprised . " Will you talk with Mr. Rockefeller ? " " Certainly , " I said . " Well , " he said a little doubtfully , " I 'll try to arrange it . " II For two years our bargain was faithfully kept , I going usually to his office at 26 Broadway . That in itself at the start , for one as unfamiliar as I was with the scene and customs of big business , was an adventure . My entrance and exit to Mr. Rogers ' office were carried on with a secrecy which never failed to amuse me . The alert , handsome , businesslike little chaps who received me at the entrance to the Rogers ' suite piloted me unerringly by a route where nobody saw me and I saw nobody , into the same small room opening on to a court , and it never seemed the same route . I was not slow in discovering that across the court in the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be turned my way whenever I looked across . It may have meant nothing at all . I only record the fact . The only person besides Mr. Rogers I ever met in those offices was his private secretary , Miss Harrison , a woman spoken of with awe at that date as having a ten thousand dollar salary , one of those women who know their employer 's business from A to Z and whom they can trust absolutely . She radiated efficiency ? business competency . Along with her competency went that gleam of hardness which efficient business women rarely escape . Miss Harrison never appeared except on rare occasions when an extra document was needed . She was as impersonal as the chairs in the room . We discussed in these interviews with entire frankness the laws which they had flouted . I could not shock Mr. Rogers with records , not even when I confronted him one day with the testimony he had given on a certain point which he admitted was not according to the facts . He curtly dismissed the subject . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As for rebates , " somebody would have taken them if we had not . " " But with your strength , Mr. Rogers , " I argued , " you could have forced fair play on the railroads and on your competitors . " " Ali , " he said , " but there was always somebody without scruples in competition , however small that somebody might be . He might grow . " There it was , the obsession of the Standard Oil Company that danger lurked in small as well as great things , that nothing however trivial must live outside of its control . These talks made me understand as I could not from the documents themselves the personal point of view of independents like Mr. Rogers who had been gathered into the organization in the first decade of monopoly making . For instance there was Mr. Rogers ' reason for desiring the trust agreement which created the Standard Oil Trust in 1882 : " By 1880 , " said Mr. Rogers , " I had stock in nearly all of the seventy or so companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these companies was not known to the public . In case of my death there would have been practically no buyer except Mr. Flagler , Mr. Rockefeller , and a few others on the inside . My heirs would not have reaped the benefit of my holdings . The formation of the trust changed this . The public at once realized the value of the trust certificate . That is , my estate was guarded in case of my death . " He often emphasized the part economies had played in building up not only the concern but their individual fortunes ? economies and putting their money back into the business . " We lived in rented houses and saved money to buy stock in the company , " he told me once . Only one who remembers as I do the important place that owning your own home took in the personal economy of the self-respecting individual of that day can feel the force of this explanation . I was curious about how he had been able to adjust his well-known passion for speculation with Mr. Rockefeller 's wellknown antagonism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever object ? " I asked . " Oh , " he said a Little ruthfully , " I was never a favorite . I suppose I was born a gambler . In the early days of the Charles Pratt Company , the Company of which I was a member , I always carried on the speculations for the concern . Mr. Pratt said , ' Henry , I have n't got the nerve to speculate . I kicked all the clothes off last night worrying about the market . ' ' Give me the money , ' I told him , ' and I will furnish the nerve . ' We simply raked in the money , " making a gesture with both hands . " And of course it came out of the producer . " " That is what my father always said , " I told him . " One of the severest lectures he ever gave me came from one of those booms in the market which sent everybody in the Oil Regions crazy , for which I suppose you were responsible . I remember a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers in Titusville were on the street or in the Oil Exchange ? everybody speculating . I was in High School , the fever caught Me , and I asked father for one hundred dollars to try my luck in the market . He was as angry with me as I ever saw him . ' No daughter of mine , ' he said , etc. , etc . " " Wise man , " Mr. Rogers commented . " But it was not because he was so cautious , " I said . " It was because he thought it was morally wrong . He would no more have speculated in the stock market than he would have played poker for money . " " I always play poker when the market is closed , " said Mr. Rogers . " I ca n't help it . Saturday afternoons I almost always make up a poker party and every now and then John Gates and I rig up something . He 'll come around and say , ' Henry , is n't it about time we started something ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informal , natural . We even argued with entire friendliness the debatable question , " What is the worst thing the Standard Oil Company ever did ? " Only now and then did one of us flare and then the other generally changed the subject . " He 's a liar and a hypocrite and you know it , " I exploded one day when we were talking of a man who had led in what to me was a particularly odious operation . " I think it is going to rain , " said Mr. Rogers , looking out of the window with ostentatious detachment . Mr. Rogers not only produced documents and arguments ; he produced people with whom I wanted to talk . The most important was Henry Flagler , who had been in on the South Improvement Company , that early deal with the railroads which had started the Standard Oil Company off on the road to monopoly . There had always been a controversy as to who had suggested that scheme . Mr. Flagler was in it . What did he know ? Mr. Rogers arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an acceptable figure even to Wall Street in those days . There were scandals in his private life which , true or not , his fellow-financiers did not like . Bad for business . I found him a very different type from Henry Rogers . He , for instance , did not conceal his distrust of John Rockefeller . " He would do me out of a dollar to-day , " he cried off his guard and with an excited smash of his fist on the table and then , catching himself and with a remarkable change of tone ? " that is , if he could do it honestly , Miss Tarbell , if he could do it honestly . " Mr. Flagler knew what I had come for but instead of answering my direct questions he began to tell me with some show of emotion of his own early life , how he had left home because his father was a poor clergyman ? four hundred dollars a year , a large family of children . He had not succeeded until he went into the commission business with Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were prospered , " he said piously . In the long story he told me , the phrase , " We were prospered , " came in again and again . That was not what I was after . Their prosperity was obvious enough . Finally I returned with some irritation to the object of my visit . " I see you do not know or are unwilling to say , Mr. Flagler , who originated the South Improvement Company , but this is certain : Mr. Rockefeller had the credit of it in the Oil Regions . You know , yourself , how bitter the feeling was there . " " But , ah , Miss Tarbcll , " he said , " how often the reputation of a man in his lifetime differs from his real character . Take the greatest character in our history , how different was our Lord and Saviour regarded when he was alive from what we now know him to have been . " After that , further questioning was of course hopeless and I sat listening to the story of how the Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was happier to leave a room , but I was no happier than Mr. Flagler was to have me go . Mr. Rogers produced Mr. Flagler and others of lesser importance . But although I referred to his semi-promise inour first interview to produce Mr. Rockefeller I found after a few months there was no hope of this . If I hinted at it he parried . III Nearly a year went by after my first interview with Mr. Rogers before the articles began to appear . I rather expected him to cut me off when he realized that I was trying to prove that the Standard Oil Company was only an enlarged South Improvement Company . But to my surprise my arguments did not seem to disturb him . They had won , had they not ? He sometimes complained that I had been unnecessarily blunt or a bit vindictive , but he continued to receive me in friendly fashion and to give me perhaps not all the help he might but always something to make me think twice , frequently to modify a view . But if he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he continue the interviews ? Gradually I became convinced it was because of his interest in my presentation of a particular episode in their history . It was a case in which Mr. Rogers and John Archibald , along with all of the members of the Board of a subsidiary company , the Vacuum Oil Company of Rochester , New York , had been indicted for conspiring to destroy an independent refinery in Buffalo , New York . In my opening interview with Mr. Rogers he had told me with some show of feeling that he wanted me to get a correct and impartial version of this Buffalo case , as he always called it . There had been a break in his voice when with hesitation he said , " That case is a sore point with Mr. Archibald and me . I want you to go into it thoroughly . I have the reports of the testimony before the Grand Jury. ; it took me months to secure them . Of course in a sense I have no right to them . But I told my children that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vindicate him . He must stand or fan in their estimation by that testimony . " At our second interview he produced the testimony before the Grand Jury , repeating again that of course he had no business with it but that he had to have it . He would not allow me to take it away , and at his request I read the sixty or more pages in his presence . It seemed quite clear to me , as I told Mr. Rogers on finishing the reading , that his connection with the affair had been so indirect that I could see no reason for his indictment , although it seemed equally clear to me that there was ample reason for the indictment of certain members of the Vacuum Board . The Judge was of that opinion , for he dismissed the indictment against Mr. Rogers and two of his fellow-directors while sustaining that against the responsible operating heads of the concern . I soon discovered that what Mr. Rogers wanted me to make out was that the three men who had founded the independent enterprise , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done so for the sole purpose of forcing the Standard to buy them out at a high price ; that is , that it was a case of planned blackmail . But the testimony certainly showed little evidence of that while it did show clearly enough that the managers of the Vacuum Oil Company from the hour they had learned of the undertaking had made deliberate and open attempts to prevent the Buffalo Refinery from doing business . The more thoroughly I went into the matter ? and I worked hard over it ? the more convinced I was that while there had been bad faith and various questionable practices on the part of members of the independent firm , they had started out to build up a business of their own . Also it was clear they had had hardly a shadow of success under the grilling opposition of the Standard concern . This included various suits for infringement of patents all of which the Standard had lost , In course of the years of litigation four juries , two Grand Juries , and two Petit Juries gave verdicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so shot to pieces by the continuous bombardment that it had to be put into the hands of a receiver . The Standard offered to settle for eighty-five thousand dollars and the Judge ordered the acceptance . This made them the owners of the bone of contention . I had a feeling that my final conclusion in the matter would probably end my relations with Mr. Rogers . I did not want to spring that conclusion on him ; that is , I wanted him to know ahead of publication where I had come out . Although I had never allowed him to read an article before its appearance , that being part of the original compact , I broke my rule in this case . Promptly I received a letter asking me to call at 26 Broadway . He received me in his usual cordial way and told me he had gone over my article carefully , compared it with certain papers in his possession , and had written me a letter in which he stated his criticisms . Handing me the letter he said , " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that out loud , so that we can talk it over here . " I began to read , but broke off with the first sentence . Mr. Rogers had written that he appreciated my request that he should make the story correspond with his knowledge and opinion of the case . " Mr. Rogers , " I said , " if you will look at my letter you will see that I did not suggest that you make the article correspond with your opinion of this case . I am convinced that I can not do that . I asked you to examine the article and see if I had made any errors in statement or had omitted any essential testimony on either side . " He smiled . " Never mind , go ahead , " he said . The letter was admirable , almost every point well taken . There was nothing which it was not proper for me to consider at least , and with certain of his points I said at once that I was willing to comply . I inwardly breathed a sigh of satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither of us having yielded our convictions . But I had not counted on the resources of Henry Rogers in a matter in which he was deeply concerned , particularly one which touched his personal pride and aroused his fighting spirit . For as I was about to go he sprang on me an entirely new interpretation of the case . Not only was the suit of the independent refinery in which he had been indicted a continuation of the original blackmailing scheme , but the lawyers in the case had themselves been in the conspiracy . He laid before me a number of documents which he claimed proved it . The chief of these was the itemized report of the receiver . This report , he said , showed that the lawyers had taken the case knowing that if the Buffalo concern did not win there would be no fees , that when the matter had finally been settled they had made what the receiver considered exorbitant claims for their services . There were five of them and finally they were allowed some thirty thousand dollars . " You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these facts , " why they were so eager to convict us . They were making a raid on the Standard and the Bench was with them . " That the Bench was with them he based on the fact that two of the lawyers originally in the case had later been elevated to the Bench . They had not of course heard the case but they had put their information and conclusions at the disposal of their successors . I was startled by this sudden and sinister accusation and sat for some time with my head bent over the documents , forgetting his presence , trying to get at their meaning . Was there any other explanation than that which Mr. Rogers had given me with such conviction ? Looking up , suddenly for the first time in my experience with Mr. Rogers , I caught him looking at me with narrowed and cunning eyes . I took alarm on the instant . " We are not the only ones , you see , Miss Tarbell . " " If this means what it seems to mean you are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rogers ; I shall have to consult a lawyer about the practice common in such cases . " " That will be all right , " he said . He was more exultant than I had ever found him . " I knew that paper would come in well some day . To get it I consented to our people 's buying the Buffalo refinery ? we did not want it , but I wanted to get the receiver 's reports and know just what had been done with the money we had paid them . " On the whole I had never seen him better pleased with himself than he was at that moment . His satisfaction was su great that for the first time in our acquaintance he gave me a little lecture fora caustic remark I had made . " That is not a Christian remark , " he said . I contended that it was a perfect expression of my notion of a Christian . " You ought to go to Church more frequently , " he said . " Why do n't you come and hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good terms after a discussion of our religious views and churchgoing practices and he gave me a cordial invitation to come back which I agreed to do as soon as I had studied the new angle in the Buffalo case . Aided by a disinterested and fairminded lawyer I gave a thorough study to the documents , but I could not convince myself that Mr. Rogers ' contention was sound . It is not an unusual thing for lawyers to take cases they believe in , knowing that their compensation depends on their winning . Many clients with just cases would be deprived of counsel if they had to insure a fixed compensation ; for not infrequently , as in the Buffalo case , all that a client has is involved in a suit . The practice is so common among reputable lawyers that it certainly can not be regarded as a proof of a conspiracy unless there is a reason to suppose that they have taken a case of whose merits they themselves are suspicious . There was no evidence that the counsel of the independent concern was not convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their claims were large , but lawyers are not proverbial for the modesty of their charges and besides , exorbitant charges can hardly be construed as a proof of conspiracy . When I had finally written out my conclusion I sent a copy of it to Mr. Rogers , saying I should be glad to talk it over with him if he wished . He did wish ? wrote me that he had new material to present . But before the date set for the meeting an article in our series was published which broke off our friendly relations . Iv In studying the testimony of independents over a period of some thirty years I had found repeated complaints that their oil shipments were interfered with , their cars sidetracked en route , while pressure was brought on buyers to cancel orders . There were frequent charges that height clerks were reporting independent shipments . I did not take the matter seriously at first . The general suspicion by independents of Standard dealings had to be taken into consideration , I told myself . Then too I was willing to admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is doing is considered legitimate business practice . I knew that in the office of McClure 's Magazine we were very keen to know what other publishers were doing . And there is also the overzealous and unscrupulous employee who in the name of competition recognizes no rules for his game . But the charges continued to multiply . I met them in testimony and I met them in interviews . There was no escaping espionage , men told me . " They know where we send every barrel of oil . Half the time our oil never reaches its destination . " I could scarcely believe it . And then unexpectedly there came to my desk a mass of incontrovertible proofs that what I had been hearing was true and more . As a matter of fact this system of following up independent oil shipments was letter perfect , so perfect that it was made a matter of office bookkeeping . " It looks sometimes , " Mr. Rogers had said to me , " as if something had the Standard Oil Company by the neck , something bigger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a boy 's conscience . A lad of sixteen or seventeen in the office of a Standard plant had as one of his regular monthly duties the burning of large quantities of records . He had carried out his orders for many months without attention to the content . Then suddenly his eyes fell one night on the name of a man who had been his friend since childhood , had even been his Sunday School teacher , an independent oil refiner in the city , a Standard competitor . The boy began to take notice ; he discovered that the name appeared repeatedly on different forms and in the letters which he was destroying . It made him uneasy and he began to piece the . records together . It was not long before he saw to his distress that the concern for which he was working was getting from the railroad offices of the town full information about every shipment that his friend was making . Moreover , that the office was writing to its representative in the territory to which the independent oil was going , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the correspondence showed how both were done . What was a youth to do under such circumstances ? He did n't do anything at first but finally when he could not sleep for thinking about it he gathered up a full set of documents and secretly took them to his friend . Now this particular oil refiner had been reading the McClure 's articles . He had become convinced that I was trying to deal fairly with the matter . He had also convinced himself in some way that I was to be trusted . So one night he brought me the full set of incriminating documents . There was no doubt about their genuineness . The most interesting thing to me was the way they fitted in with the testimony scattered through the investigations and law suits . Here were bookkeeping records explaining every accusation that had been made . But how could I use them ? Together we worked out a plan by which the various forms and blanks could be reproduced with fictitious names and persons and places substituted for the originals . It was after this material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with Mr. Rogers . " The original South Improvement Company formula , Mr. Rogers , provided for reports of independent shipments from the railroads . I have come on repeated charges that the practice continues . What about it ? Do you follow independent shipments ? Do you stop them ? Do you have the help of railroad shipping clerks in the operation ? " " Of course we do everything we legally and fairly can to find out what our competitors are doing , just as you do in McClure 's Magazine , " Mr. Rogers answered . " But as for any such system of tracking and stopping , as you suggest , that is nonsense . How could we do it even if we would ? " " Well , " I said , " give me everything you have on this point . " He said he had nothing more than what he had already told me . As I have said , the article came out just before I was to see Mr. Rogers on what I hoped would be the Iast of the Buffalo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him when I saw his face white with rage was when I met the appointment he had made . Our interview was short . " Where did you get that stuff ? " he said angrily , pointing to the magazine on the table . And all I could say was in substance , " Mr. Rogers , you ca n't for a moment think that I would tell you where I got it . You will recall my efforts to get from you anything more than a general denial that these practices of espionage so long complained of were true , could be explained by legitimate competition . You know this bookkeeping record is true . " There were a few curt exchanges about other points in the material but nothing as I now recall on the Buffalo case . The article ended my visits to 26 Broadway . V Nearly four years passed before I again saw Henry Rogers and in that period exciting and tragic events had come his way . There was the copper war . He and his friends had attempted to build up a monopoly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in petroleum , the Amalgamated Copper Company . A youngster , F. Augustus Heinze , had come into Montana and by bold and ruthless operation put together a copper company of his own . The two organizations were soon at each other 's throats . It was a business war without a vestige of decency , one in which every devious device of the law and of politics was resorted to by both sides . But Mr. Rogers had other troubles . He and his friends had been engaged in organizing the gas interests of the East . They had engineered stock raids which had been as disastrous to Wall Street as to gambling Main Street . Such operations in the past had never cost him more than a passing angry comment by the public press . Now , however , came something damaging to his reputation and his pride . It was a series of lurid articles by a bold and very-much-on-the-inside broker and speculator ? Thomas Lawson of Boston . For nearly two years Lawson published monthly in Everybody 's Magazine , under the admirable title " Frenzied Finance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group and what they had cost their dupes . That story cut Mr. Rogers ' pride to the quick . He is said to have threatened the American News Company with destruction if it circulated the magazine . Taken all together , the excitement and anger was too much for even his iron frame and indomitable spirit , and in the summer of 1907 he suffered a stroke which put him out of the fight for many weeks . When he came back it was at once to collide with the Government suit against the Standard Oil Company , and soon after that with the Panic of 1907 , a panic for which his old enemy in copper , A. Augustus Heinze , was largely responsible . Early in November when the panic was still raiding the banks and the millionaires of the country I stood one day at a corner on Fifth Avenue waiting for the traffic to clear . Suddenly I saw an arm waving to me from a slowly passing open automobile and there was H. H. Rogers smiling at me in the friendliest way . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Why not try to see him ? If he 'll talk about what is going on what a story he could tell . " But would he see me ? I was a little dubious about trying . Still the greeting and the smile seemed to mean that at /east he harbored no ill will . Supposing , I said , he is sufficiently subdued to go over with me his exciting life . What a document of big business in the ' 80 's and ' 90 's he could produce if he would put down his recollections with the frankness with which he had sometimes talked to me . It seemed worth trying for and I asked for an appointment . I had not made a mistake . Mr. Rogers was harboring no ill will . I was promptly invited to come to his house . He greeted me heartily . I found him physically changed , stouter , less sinewy , but quite as frank as ever . He told me of his stroke ; he spoke bitterly of what he called the Roosevelt panic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Standard Oil Company . He gave me my cue when he began to talk about the early days of the Oil Regions . " There is a whole chapter , " he said , " that has not been written , that from ' 59 to ' 72 . " We were getting on swimmingly when our interview was cut short by a card handed him ? Joseph Seep , the head of the Standard Oil Purchasing Agency . It amused him greatly that Mr. Seep should have come in while I was there . " Now you 'll have to go , " he said , and he put me out by a circuitous route . As at 26 Broadway , callers were not to see each other . As we came into a dark hall he turned on the light . " you see we have to economize now , " he said laughingly . Our good-by was cordial . " We 'll talk about this again , " he said . " Call up Miss Harrison in a week or ten days and we 'll make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The coming months were too difficult for Mr. Rogers . His vast business affairs continued complicated ; the legend of his invincibility in the market was weakened . Moreover , such was the bitterness of the Standard Oil Company over the Government suit that I doubt if he or his associates would have considered it wise for him to talk to me . They probably thought he had talked already too much to too little purpose . They ? and he probably ? never understood how much he had done to make me realize the legitimate greatness of the Standard Oil Company , how much he had done to make me understand better the vastness and complications of its problems and the amazing grasp with which it dealt with them . Mr. Rogers ' complaint against me was that I had never been able to submerge my contempt for their illegitimate practices in my admiration for their genius in organization , the boldness of their imagination , and execution . But my contempt had increased rather than diminished as I worked . I never had an animus against their size and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was willing that they should combine and grow as big and rich as they could , but only by legitimate means . But they had never played fair and that ruined their greatness for me . I am convinced that their brilliant example has contributed not only to a weakening of the country 's moral standards but to its economic unsoundness . The experience of the past decade particularly seems to me to amply justify my conviction . I was never to see Mr. Rogers again , for in May of 1909 he suddenly died ? two years before the Supreme Court dissolved the Standard Oil Company .
