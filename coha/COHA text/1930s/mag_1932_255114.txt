Dies irae , dies illa , <P> Solvet saeclumm in favilla . . . . <P> A gloomy , wrathful day , gloomy as the days of the 13th Century friar who cried Dies Irae ! Capitalism totters . Socialism ? Communism ? No , man is corrupt , his society is decadent , even his systems of worship are sterile . . . . There is still God . But are there not many Gods ? - the Jehovah of the Fundamentalists , the incense-wrapped God of the Anglo-Catholics , the polite God of the Episcopalians , the companionable God of such new faiths as Dr. Frank Buchman 's Groups ? There are also many prophets , cultists , purveyors of fancy panaceas to the dejected . They are in the market place . But in the study is one who also is beginning to be heard again : the theologian . <P> In the U. S. theology is currently not so dead as it was a decade ago , and in gloomy , depressed Europe it is actually alive . Who are its leaders ? Most thoughtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lutheran . But all are aware of Karl Barth , 45 , Swiss founder of a potent Christian philosophy . <P> Before the War , Karl Barth preached in the German Reformed Church . Like his professor-father he is an eminent theologian . His theology , now called Barthianism , is pessimistic , dogmatic . It offers the dun-colored thesis that Man is immoral , selfish , bound to be an " unprofitable servant " to the end . Man achieves nothing , will be saved only by grace and belief in the " absolute otherness of God . " Barthianism rejects Modernism in so far as Modernism throws out too much of the Bible , too much of God . Fundamentalism also is rejected insofar as it is hampered by the Bible . <P> In the blackness of spiritual despair Theologian Barth-now married and professor of theology at the University of Bonn-has attracted an immense following . Like a wan light amid disillusion and doubt , Barthianism nourishes in German and Swiss universities . Religious socialists join in , go on working for social betterment although it will not change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin , stooped , slightly weak-eyed but rather jolly , does not evangelize . He will not come to the U. S. because the U. S. is too worldly . Nevertheless his U. S. admirers-who are many-wish he would come because they believe he would take the disillusioned , disappointed colleges by storm . <P> To Basle last month , from all over Europe , went delegates to a conference of Young Theologians . News of them reached the U. S. last week . They discussed their attempts to rescue the Modern Man . Chief feature of the conference was a one-act play presented by the British delegates , in which the Modern Man is approached by a Fundamentalist with an enormous Bible , a pompous Anglo-Catholic , a cordial member of the Buchman Groups , a Modernist who cuts most of his Bible into little bits . None succeeds in rousing Modern Man from his sleep . At last comes a Barthian . He is successful .
