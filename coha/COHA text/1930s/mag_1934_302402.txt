Up to a fifth-floor office in Washington 's old Post Office Department Building all one day last week trooped hopeful airline operators with sealed bids for the nation 's airmail . After a two-month cycle of fury and futility they thought they were about to get back what a nervous Government had snatched from them . When the deadline for receiving bids came and went , an underling scooped up 45 thick envelopes , tied them into a bundle , stuffed them into a vault . <P> Next day , just before noon , the precious package was carried downstairs to the large , unlovely office of the Superintendent of Airmail . There , tense and expectant , some 200 airline executives , newshawks and Government officials jammed around a long table . At the head sat baldish Postmaster General Farley slightly ill-at-ease , surrounded by a pack of assistants . Spectators mounted chairs and desks to see and hear better . <P> Promptly at noon a postal official slit open the first bid and read it aloud . Others followed , to the scratch of an accountant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old-line companies blossomed out with a minor change in name-part of the Farley program for corporate reorganization . Eastern Air Transport became Eastern Air Lines . Transcontinental &; Western Air put three new periods into its abbreviated title . American Airways switched to American Air Lines . Only Western Air Express made a major change by becoming General Air Lines . Because its previous contracts were held under the names of its operating subsidiaries , only United Air Lines bid under its old corporate title . <P> But altogether new was the character of bids offered by these oldtime operators for mail contracts . The crowd broke into a long whistle of surprise when bids of 17 and 19 per airplane mile were read off for routes on which " General " Farley had specified a maximum of 45 . The companies , it seemed , were ready to cut their throats and bleed to financial death rather than die of slow starvation without any airmail contracts . <P> Loudest whistles of all came from the crowd when the bids of American Air Lines ' inscrutable Errett Lobban Cord were read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Errett Cord had been expected to underbid the field , capture a virtual monopoly of U. S. airmail . Instead , he bid so close to the maximum on eight routes , that he was heavily underbid on all but the Newark-Boston run . He stood to lose even his old southern transcontinental route , having overbid his nearest competitor for half the run by 10 . Obviously fear of Cord competition had caused other lines to hack down their rates to a level where they could not possibly make their operating expenses . <P> Likeliest explanations of Cord 's high bids : 1 ) loud cries of " Wolf " had put him on his best behavior ; 2 ) possibility that no contracts would be awarded under Mr. Farley 's temporary ( three-month ) plan because of the imminence of legislation providing for one-year contracts ( with an entirely new set of bids ) as suggested by President Roosevelt and reported favorably by the House Post Office Committee last week . <P> Of all the major companies , United Air Lines* came out of the bidding most favorably . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ route . Likewise uncontested were the bids for its old Pacific Coast routes .
