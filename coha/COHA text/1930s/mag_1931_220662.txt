Arkansas ' Governor Parnell went to French Lick , Ind . last week to attend the Governors ' Conference . That left Lieutenant Governor Lawrence Wilson in charge of the State with all the powers and privileges of a chief executive . One of his first official acts was to pardon his brother Fred , convicted last March of grand larceny and awaiting formal sentence of four years in jail . <P> Lawrence and Fred are the sons of Mrs. Leon Wilson , 63 , who lives on a large farm near Stephens , Ark . Brother Fred 's conviction filled his mother with shame and anguish . Last week Brother Lawrence declared that he had " no apologies to offer " for Brother Fred 's pardon , that he had issued it largely because of his " grief-stricken mother . " Two days later he went to a raspberry festival at Wynne where he told merrymakers : " You people of Cross County are all my friends and do n't hesitate to call on me for help . Remember , I can still grant pardons. "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
