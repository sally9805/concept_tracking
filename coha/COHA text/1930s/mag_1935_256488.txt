Five years ago a blond young Briton ambled down London 's Charing Cross Road , turned into Denmark Street ( equivalent of Manhattan 's Tin-Pan Alley ) , sought out a publisher who might be sympathetic . The young man had a tune to sell . He played it on the piano ; the publisher asked its name . Ray Noble thought quickly . " Why , call it ' Goodnight , Sweetheart , ' " he said . Thereupon Ray Noble 's own name was made . <P> Never was a song more cruelly abused . Yet many realized that it was a rare , good tune in its smooth , nostalgic style . And it served to turn attention to quiet Ray Noble , no ordinary , illiterate , catchpenny songwriter but the well-mannered son of a well-to-do London neurologist and a nephew of T. Tertius Noble , the venerated organist of St. Thomas ' Episcopal Church in Manhattan . Organist Noble has never been known to hum " Goodnight , Sweetheart . " Nor has he ever met his nephew , famed now for having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But only three blocks away from St. Thomas ' last week , Ray Noble began a job which any young musician might envy . He undertook a long-time engagement in the window-walled Rainbow Room , Rockefeller Center 's smart night club . Significantly , an Englishman was bringing dance music to the country which supplies Europe with most of its jazz . <P> The Rainbow Room wanted Ray Noble for its opening last autumn ( TIME , Oct. 8 ) . His phonograph record vogue was tremendous . He had written more sure tunes : " Love is the Sweetest Thing , " " Love Locked Out , " " The Very Thought of You . " But when he arrived in September he found the Musicians ' Union wary of " foreigners . " Not until February was he allowed to assemble an orchestra . Two weeks later he was broadcasting for Coty Perfume . <P> If the Rainbow Room customers expected to see a showman last week they were roundly disappointed when quiet Ray Noble conducted his men . His easy gestures were all from the wrist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piano , pattered a bit . He had gathered first-rate U. S. players and , unlike many a conductor , he freely admits his debt to them . Trombonist Glen Miller is one of the best " hot men " in the U. S. And so is Bud Freeman , Noble 's tenor saxophone . Only two of the musicians came from London with Noble : Bill Harty , his manager and drummer , and Crooner Al Bowlly , a swarthy South African who began his career in a Johannesburg caf . <P> In three months all the players have acquired the glossy Noble technique . At rehearsals the Briton works patiently and courteously . With a few " hot " exceptions , he has made the arrangements himself . And they are all smoothly polished , all rich in counterpoint , most of them sweet , none sissy . Many of his introductions are almost symphonic . Yet Noble never forgets that he plays for dancing and his rhythm never flags . Even " Goodnight , Sweetheart " is a sturdy swinging tune when Ray Noble plays it .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
