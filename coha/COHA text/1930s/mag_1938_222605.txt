Report . There are currently about 12,870,000 U. S. unemployed . On relief are more than 17,314,000 . By April 1 approximately 14% of the nation 's population were beneficiaries of public aid of one kind or another . These facts , included last week in a preliminary report by the Senate 's Special Committee to Investigate Unemployment &; Relief , headed by South Carolina 's pro-Rooseveltian Senator James Francis Byrnes , would have been enough to make that document arresting . It contained considerably more . Eight weeks ago Financier Bernard Mannes Baruch told the Byrnes Committee that the chief cause of the country 's current economic ills was the Administration 's policies-urged modification of the levies on 1 ) undistributed profits and 2 ) capital gains . Most sensational item in the report last week was a flat statement to the effect that the best way to diminish unemployment was to repeal the first and modify the second . <P> Conference . Byrnes Committee report was issued at precisely the moment when this recommendation was sure to have maximum effect . House &; Senate committees-the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to have persuaded to vote for the Reorganization Bill last month-had been deadlocked over the tax bill for a week . Cause of the deadlock : Pat Harrison 's Senate Committee was adamant about eliminating the undistributed profits tax entirely , modifying capital gains levies almost out of sight ; Bob Doughton 's House Committee was equally adamant about saving the Administration 's face by preserving the first at least in principle , keeping a fair share of the second . Effect of the Byrnes Committee report was to lend weight to arguments on the Senate side . Two days after its release , the two tax committees met for the seventh time , settled down to thresh the matter out behind closed doors . The doors remained closed for six hours except when they opened briefly to let out the dozen or so non-legislative tax experts who normally attend all such committee conclaves , let out two hungry Senators for a hasty bite , let out the House conferees for a brief separate meeting , then readmitted them . When the whole committee finally emerged , the conferees announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of drafting , debate and conferences , Congress finally had a tax bill destined soon to become the law of the land .
