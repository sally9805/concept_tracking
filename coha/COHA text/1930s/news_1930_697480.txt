txt WAR CLOUDS OVER EUROPE . They Exist , of Course , but There Are Bright Spots in Between . To the Editor of TM New York Times : I am afraid , though I ' am not too old to learn , I shall never acquire the " greater maturity of judgment " needed to understand Colonel POWell 's somber views of the European situation . Czechoslovakia , as the Colonel says , is a young country , born at the time of open diplomacy , and therefore I hope to be pardoned for my lack " in experience , tact and discretion " in my disrespectful reference to his dark visions of forthcoming European wars . The whole purport of my mischievous letter was that the European devil is not so black as he is sometimes painted . As a European , I was both amused and pained to see ' our old Europe , the , cradle of civilization , pictured as a hotbed of wars , hatred and intolerance , and that is why I ventured to differ . with the Colonel 's views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making for wars , but , on the other hand , there are also forces  --  and very strong forces ? making for peace . Is'it necessary to recapitulate the many sincere efforts the European statesmen , . with the help of many prominent Americans , have made to assure the peace of Europe and , indeed , of the whole world ? What of the League of Natione ? What of Locarno ? What of the Briand-Kellogg pact ? What of the Briand proposal for a Federated Europe ? Is it not better and wiser to emphasize the forces making for peace than to be ever looking for some new danger spots and new gathering *storms ? ALES BR OZ , Secretary of the Czechoslovak Legation . Washington , D. C. , Nov. 26 , 1930 . KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEF . Authorities Hear of Wrong Conditions but Seldom Act . To the Editor of The New York Times : In THE Tans this morning I noticed an editorial entitled " Exposure and Punishment , " which contains the statement : " No one supposes that these miserable wretches wearing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers . It is ' incredible that the Assistant District Attorney who confessed to having taken petty bribes for years had given his chief any reason to suspect his loyalty and integrity . " Of course , no one would be foolish enough to believe that superior officers in the Police Department and the District Attorney knew of the corruption , and permitted it to continue , but ' every one familiar with conditions ih the Women 's Court knew that they were " rotten , " and I think it will ' develop that ' these conditions were specifically called to the attention of the authorities , without results . The introduction of the use of the so-called green slip in this class of cases and the abolition by Commissioner of the Special Service Squad indicate that conditions were not as they should be . Despite this , the Special Service Squad was split up and the men constituting-it were assigned to various inspection districts , and some of these men are the very men who are now involved . The Lexow and Mazet committees and the Page committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , revealed corruption and inpropriety , but resulted in no permanent cure . SAMUEL , MARCUS . New York , Nov. 29 , 1930.
