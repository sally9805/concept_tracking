Oldtimers insist that there are still carriages on the streets of Norwalk , Ohio , built by Andrew Fisher . Andrew begat Lawrence , also a wheelwright , and Lawrence begat seven sons . They were named William Andrew , Frederic John , Alfred Joseph , Charles Thomas , Edward Francis , Lawrence Peter , Howard . William Andrew was the lazy one . He would cock his hat over his eye , pretend not to see his father beckoning him into the blacksmith shop . But ultimately he and all the rest except Howard industriously followed their father 's and grandfather 's trade . After the turn of the century the six Brothers Fisher started Fisher Body Corp . William Andrew became president . General Motors took them in and today they are the most numerous , most affluent guild-family in the world . Partly to advertise Fisher Bodies , and partly because they relish good craftsmanship , last week they had a party . <P> To the Fisher party , held in the auditorium of the GM building in Detroit , went 104 boys from 48 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either junior ( 12 to 16 ) or senior ( 16 to 19 ) members of the Fisher Body Craftsman 's Guild . Each had constructed a model of the Napoleonic coach which is the Fisher Body trademark . Some 1,350 other U.S. boys had built models too , but these 104 were the best . In the pocket of his Sunday suit , each boy had some part of $50 which General Motors had given him for spending money during his visit to Detroit . While Graham McNamee gushed a description of the setting over a national hookup on the General Motors Family Party radio hour , each boy wondered if he was going to be one of the four to receive a $5,000 four-year scholarship at college . <P> Formed last August , the Guild had sent its members specifications for the coach . Technicians had examined hundreds of models , alike to the lay observer as two peas in a pod . The judges included President Thomas Stockham Baker of Carnegie Institute of Technology ; Board Chairman Robert Andrews Millikan of California Institute of Technology ; Board Chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dexter Simpson Kimball of Cornell 's College of Engineering and eight other engineering deans and professors . Also there was Daniel Carter Beard , national Boy Scout commissioner , who served as honorary president of the Guild , of which William Andrew Fisher is president . <P> President Fisher , who wanted to see what the nation 's boys could do with plane , chisel , glue and mould , had sounded the Guild 's keynote last year : " It is our endeavor to foster . . . that spirit of fine workmanship which permeated the craft guilds of bygone centuries . . . . There was a pride in workmanship which kept alive a competitive spirit among Guild workers , and there was a healthy rivalry between Guilds in the same industry . . . . Regardless of the advancement in machinery , there is today and will continue to be a need for real artisans and craftsmen . "
