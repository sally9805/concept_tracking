FLOWERS OF EVIL-Charles Baudelaire ; translated by George Dillon and Edna St. Vincent Millay-Harper ( $2.75 ) . <P> Translations are tricky and most poets , at least , would say that poetry is untranslatable . Charles Baudelaire ( 1821-67 ) , whom the late Lytton Strachey called " the Swift of poetry , " and who is still the most widely read poet in France , was a well-to-do bourgeois who despised his class , lived most of his life with a mulatto mistress , took opium and scandalized even Paris with his Fleurs du Mal , which combined polish , putrescence and pornography to an inspired degree . Since his death he has been manhandled by many a translator . Last week the latest attempt to transplant his hot-house Flowers of Evil was put on exhibition in the U. S. This time it was the work of two pairs of hands : Pulitzer Prize Poets Edna St. Vincent Millay and George Dillon . Both French and U. S. critics sent flowery congratulations , seemed to feel that at last Baudelaire had been well &; truly turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collaboration . George Dillon , who started the job by himself , sent her several samples of his version ; her enthusiasm was so quickly fired that she wanted to lend a hand . Four months later the job was done . Of the 72 poems ( about half of Baudelaire 's published poetry ) , 36 were translated by Poet Millay , 35 by Dillon . One they did together . They omitted only one ( Femmes Damnes ) of the six poems that seemed scabrous to the Paris police of 1857 . Though she admits that some of their versions are not so much translations as adaptations , Poet Millay says that in every instance they have used the original metre and form , invites comparison by printing Baudelaire 's version on the opposite page . In some cases she thinks they have been able to give the literal equivalent . Some might think it queer that so ladylike a poet as Edna St. Vincent Millay should spend four months with such a tortured satanist as Charles Baudelaire . With a stamp of her foot she defies the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good translation of a poet of whom one disapproves . " <P> Dillon sample : <P> <P> Like angels with bright savage eyes <P> I will come treading phantom-wise <P> Hither where thou art wont to sleep , <P> Amid the shadows hollow and deep . <P> And I will give thee , my dark one , <P> Kisses as icy as the moon , <P> Caresses as of snakes that crawl <P> In circles round a cistern 's wall . <P> When morning shows its livid face <P> There will be no-one in my place , <P> And a strange cold will settle here . <P> Others , not knowing what thou art , <P> May think to reign upon thy heart <P> With tenderness : I trust to fear . <P> Millay sample : <P> It seems to me sometimes my blood is <P> bubbling out <P> As fountains do , in rhythmic sobs ; I <P> feel it spout <P> And lapse ; I hear it plainly ; it makes , <P> a murmuring sound ; <P> But from what wound it wells , so far I <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lists , round tumbled armoured bones , <P> It soaks the city , islanding the paving-stones ; <P> Everything thirsty leans to lap it , with stretched head ; <P> Trees suck it up ; it stains their trunks and branches red . <P> I turn to wine for respite . I drink , and <P> I drink deep ; <P> ( Just for one day , one day , neither to <P> see nor hear ! )
