NOAH WEBSTER : SCHOOLMASTER TO AMERICA-Harry R. Warfel-Macmillan ( $3.50 ) . Though Webster and dictionary are synonymous in the U. S. , Noah Webster 's posthumous fame is cloudy . He is often confused with Daniel Webster ( no kin ) , and his multitudinous activities have faded from popular memory . Last week , in a full-length biography of Noah Webster , the first in 50 years , Author Warfel dusted the cobwebs off this early Yankee , showed him as a genuine and valuable antique . <P> A prime example of his period and place , Noah Webster ( 1758-1843 ) was a school-teacher who by zeal and persistence became a Citizen Fixit to the whole U. S. Because he insisted on bursting out of his own bailiwick to mend his neighbors ' manners , he was not popular ; but before he died the U. S. was proud of him . Even more than his Dictionary his famed blue-backed Speller ( which sold nearly 100 million copies before it went out of use ) knit U. S. dialects together into one more-or-less standard tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adolescent nation . <P> Connecticut-born and bred , Noah Webster was the son of a sturdy farmer , a veteran of the French &; Indian Wars , who mortgaged his farm in order to send his promising son to college at Yale . The Revolution did not interrupt Noah 's education : what soldiering he did was a holiday task . One summer he marched with his father and two brothers to Ticonderoga to help repel Burgoyne 's invasion , was too late to see any fighting . After his graduation his father gave him an eight-dollar Continental bill ( worth about two in silver ) and sent him out to make his own way . He taught school , studied law , sashayed into Hartford society-where his Yankee angularity drew down pert feminine comments : " His reflections are as prosy as those of our horse . . . . In conversation he is even duller than in writing , if that is possible . " <P> But Noah Webster , jun. , esq . ( as he signed himself , to the ribald delight of his lighter-minded contemporaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the era of vacillating reconstruction after the Revolution he saw his didactic chance , made it his patriotic duty . He launched his first Speller as a Yankee privateer against the King 's English : " I have too much pride to stand indebted to Great Britain for books to learn our children the letters of the alphabet . " A good salesman , he toured the U. S. lecturing in his book 's behalf , trying-to rouse the State legislatures to protect this home growth by copyright . The book caught on , in spite of a frontispiece of Webster resembling a porcupine , which a hostile reviewer said would frighten even a patriotic child .
