txt NO MIXTURE ADVISED . Dr. Fisk Believes Man Will Find Constructive Escapes . To the Editor of The New York Times : In THE NEW Yortic TIMES of Aug. 22 you reported Dr. Eugene Lyman Fisk , vice president of the Life Extension Institute , as saying that intense living has made deep inroads on the lives of middle-aged men , but that he " would be the last to suggest slowing down , " and quoting him further as follows : " Man has three outlets : intoxication , love and work . The chief American outlet is work . Through love , man may gain leisure . It is a good check on both intoxication and work . It 's not a bad idea to mix the three about even . " Because of My long personal association with Dr. Fisk I queried him by wireless to the French liner Lafayette , on which he set sail on the day previous to your Interview with him , asking whether he had been correctly quoted . Dr. Fisk has replied to me by wireless : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on three escapes from reality , but said it is better to love intensely than lead a sterile , narrow life . I did not say mix the three , but said work is the best outlet . Do what you can to correct . I said man employs three escapes , but I had abiding faith that he would find . constructive rather than destructive escapes . " As is well known , Dr. Fisk in all his writings , including the book " Alcohol , " for which I wrote the introduction , has consistently advocated total abstention from alcohol as a health measure . After this unqualified statement it might be unnecessary to add that Dr. Fisk has for many years been a convinced prohibitionist , were it not for the currency that has already been given to a statement all too readily seized upon by the exponents of the wet cause . I hope that those who see this correction of his quoted views , which I have made at Dr. Fisk 's request , ' will aid in spreading it among those who continue to misquote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aug. 28 , 1930 . The Power Behind the Dollar . To the Editor of The Neto York Times : Mr. Gerard 's list of rulers of America is admirably designed to increase our belief in the power of the dollar , and to make us forget the power that lies ' behind this alleged national symbol . What a list of educators , statesmen , chemists , physicists , biologists , engineers and physicians one could present from whose labor has grown the very power that Mr. Gerard attributes to the dollar-maker ! It was not , to mention but one example , men of the class cited by Mr. Gerard who built the Panama Canal . This great national asset we owe to the foresight and courage of a President , the skill and personality of an engineer and the newly acquired experience of a , doctor and his entomological associates : for , in the last analysis , the success of this stupendous undertaking rests not on the power of the dollar , but on our knowledge of the habits of a mosquito !
