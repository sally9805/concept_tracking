Written seven years ago by the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Craig 's Wife and The Show-Off , Reflected Glory at least has the distinction of being Tallulah Bankhead 's most creditable vehicle since her repatriation five years ago . <P> On her way to the top , Muriel Flood ( Miss Bankhead ) is alternately berated and praised by her hard-boiled and single-minded manager ( Clay Clement ) , is tirelessly pursued by a stodgy suitor from her home town . The sympathy with which she receives his proposals of marriage is discouraged by the manager , by the acrid philosophizing of a fellow trouper ( Ann Andrews ) and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although she achieves success in Manhattan , she seems perfectly willing to give up her career to marry this charmer until he is exposed as an actress-chasing cad with a concealed wife &; child . When the home-town suitor reappears , Muriel Flood greets him with great enthusiasm , but by this time he has a wife of his own , too .

After some months , tired of parades , catchwords , " discipline " and adolescent savagery , he dons civilian clothes , tries to leave , is slapped in the face by the commandant of cadets , discovers that he is a prisoner . While he is serving 30 days in the guardhouse , one of his roommates , whose notions of duty prevent him from reporting a cold to the infirmary , dies of pneumonia . In Thornton 's hearing the conscientious medical officer tells the commandant that the school ought to be prosecuted . The commandant hints that if Thornton ignores this incident , he will be made a sergeant next year .                    @
