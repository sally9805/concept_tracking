txt Demonstrating its faith in the strength of the market for its securities , the Treasury offered today to holders of about $1,250,000,000 of 414 per cent Fourth Liberty bonds , last of the wartime issues outstanding , the opportunity to exchange them either for a new Treasury bond paying 2% per cent interest , maturing in twelve years and callable in ten , or for Treasury notes of three and a half years ' maturity , paying 114 per cent interest . The department also asked for cash subscriptions for about $500,000,000 of the notes . The bonds involved in the exchange transaction carry the lowest interest which has been quoted on a direct Treasury obligation of this type . The 2 per cent consols and Panama Canal bonds sold in pre-war days were of a special class in that they enjoyed the circulation privilege . On the other hand , the new Treasury notes now offel ? ed pay one-eighth of 1 per cent more in interest and their maturity date is eleven months shorter than the 1% per cent Treasury notes of four years and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 and which in the exceptionally easy money market were subscribed about six times . Issue Awaited With Interest . The offering which the Treasury would make in exchange for the called Fourth Liberty bonds which must be redeemed by Oct. 15 has been awaited with intense interest because outstanding issues of the Treasury 's 274 per cent bonds are selling a shade under par value in the open market and an issue of $100,000,000 of four-year 11fz per cent bonds of the Federal Farm Mortgage Corporation guaranteed as to principal and interest by the government , for which competitive bids were opened last Wednesday , were undersubscribed by about $15 , - 000,000 . Apparently Treasury officials are confident that both features of the exchange offering now made will receive a favorable reception and that one effect will be to strengthen and stabilize the bond market . The new bonds , while returning exceptionally low interest for that type of government security , are of relatively short-term maturity compared with the 27k per cent bonds , which were offered to mature in twenty-five years and were callable in twenty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In case of exchanges , the holders of the Liberty bonds will get a bonus , in that interest on either the notes or the new bonds they take will begin on Sept. 16 and interest will be paid by the government in full on the Libertys tendered in exchange until Oct. 15 . So confident is the Treasury that the new lower interest rate , shorter terms bonds fit favorably into the picture , in a combined offering with what is believed to be a specially attractive short-term note , that it has reserved the right to increase the issue price at which the bonds will be given in exchange on and after Sept. 10 . A similar provision was made on April 22 last when the Treasury offered 21/2 per cent bonds , maturing in twentyfive years and callable in twenty , and 1% per cent notes of five years ' maturity in exchange for called First Liberty bonds . In that case , the issue price of the bonds was raised 50 cents for each $100 on May 8 . In announcing its exchange offering today for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange opportunity would be given the holders before the date of redemption , Oct. 15 , and that all not turned in for exchange by that time would be paid off in cash . The public debt on Aug. 29 , the last available figure , was $29,038 , - 483,651 and will be increased by the extent to which subscriptions for the cash offering of about $500 , - 000,000 of the new notes are accepted . As a rule , allotments are kept down to not more than 10 per cent in excess of the amount for which bids are asked . Debt to Be Increased . Treasury note issues which must be paid off or refunded by June , 1940 , now amount to $10,549,675,000 , of which two issues aggregating about $1,820,000,000 will mature in June and December of 1939 . This heavy intermediate-term debt will be increased by the amount sold for cash and also those accepted as exchanges by holders of the Fourth Liberty Bonds . These operations probably will increase the note issues outstanding by around $1,000,000,000 and these new notes will mature in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicates that Treasury officials are not worried by the recent unsettlement in the open market for government bonds , which has been attributed in some financial quarters to the persistency of the Treasury in recent weeks in selling $100,000,000 lots of the 21/2 per cent bonds on the competitive bidding basis for cash , at frequent intervals . There is a heavy demand by banks for short-term Treasury paper such as the 11/2 per cent notes now offered in exchange for the Libertys as well as for cash , and heavy cash subscriptions for the new notes are expected . Banks are reported to have been buying called Fourth Liberty bonds recently in anticipation of an exchange offering that they would view with favor and probably hold at least one-third of the billion and a quarter which are outstanding . Therefore , heavy offering of the bonds in exchange for the new notes also appears probable . As a desirable investment the new shorter-term bonds , it is figured , will fill a need and prove acceptable . That the early response to the offering will be watched with the greetest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to demonstrate whether the complete conf Id ence of the Treasury in the market for government bonds at the prevailing exceptionally low interest rates is based upon sound reasoning . The only 2% per cent issue in the open market at this time is a Home Owners Loan Corporation bond of 1939-49 . These are not direct Treasury bonds , but are guaranteed as to principal and interest by the government . On Saturday they closed on the New York Stock Exchange at 9918-32 for a yield of 2.78 per cent . The Treasury twenty-five and twenty-year bonds of 1955-60 on the same date closed at 99 26-32 for a yield of 2.87 per cent . The request for $500,000,000 in cash subscriptions is in line with the Treasury 's policy of maintaining a working balance in the general fund , exclusive of gold profit , of about $1,000,000,000 in carrying forward the work-relief program and meeting other current demands , On Aug. 20 the working balance was $1,201,301,660 and , exclusive of gold profit which is being used only to retire national bank notes as they are turned in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new notes for cash will raise this working balance to about $1,300 , - 000,000 . With a quarterly instalment of income taxes in excess of $200,000,000 to be received this month , it is probable that no further major borrowing operation will be necessary for some time . With the refunding of the last block of Fourth Liberty Bonds now outstanding the administration will have accomplished the retirement of the last of the Liberty Bond series . When President Roosevelt assumed office there remained in the hands of institutions and individuals approximately $8,201,000,000 of these securities , representing $6,268,000,000 of the Fourth issue , carrying 41/4 per cent interest , and $1,933,000,000 of the first issue , all but about half a billion paying 31/2 per cent . Roughly , it is estimated that when the present exchange transaction is completed , the lower interest bearing bonds and notes , which have been issued as exchanges or to obtain cash with which to pay off holders of Libertys who turned them in for cash redemption , will represent a saving of between $120 , - 000,000 and $125,000,000 annually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outstanding debt . Conversion Begun in 1933 . The gigantic conversion operations were begun in October , 1933 , when Secretary Woodin issued the first call for the redemption in the following April of a block of the Fourth Libertys . The bonds then offered as exchanges paid 41% per cent interest for the first year and 3% per cent thereafter . As the money market eased lower interest bearing bonds were offered , in some instances along with notes , in subsequent exchange offerings . About $2,304,000,000 of the Libertys have been exchanged for 21/2 per cent bonds , maturing in 1960 and callable in 1955 , this representing the lowest interest bearing refunding bonds used until the presengage in major operations to obtain more cash . The last major cash offering was that for $500 , - 000,000 , made in July , and this money was required chiefly'because of the drain on the Treasury to meet retirement of about $600,000 , - 000 in consols . ' ent offering of 2% per cent bonds , which , however , are of a much shorter maturity than the 21/2s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canal bonds called for redemption respectively on July 1 and Aug. 1 , for which the Treasury used chiefly money out of the general fund , is now virtually completed , and that drain on the resources of the Treasury ended . It is probable , of course , that around $200,000,000 of the Fourth Liberty bonds called for redemption on Oct. 15 will not be exchanged and in that event cash will be required for their retirement as they are turned in . Even with processing taxes falling below collections of last year , the revenue receipts are about $85 , - 000,000 above those of the same period of the fiscal year 1935 and until emergency outlays take a decided spurt the department will op ' parently not find it necessary to
