 | late . Not that a word would be said , the Minnestrats never held her to a rigid schedule , but her own conscience served her as time clock . She had always been well-treated , such a thing as leaving the firm had never entered her head . It was all the more surprising , then , to discover that the idea implanted by Esther Royal appeared to be growing with magical speed . It scut up shoots , unfolded leaves and burst into bloom with an energy that dizzied Gillian , clinging to a strap in the crowded car . Insane , of course , to let a suggestion take such root in her mind . The whole thing was absurd , she had no intention of leaving the Minnestrats . One did n't without a reason walk out of an office where one had worked for fifteen years , and there was no reason at all for her to leave . Well , no reason that she could give . If she accepted the new position it would be to escape from Cousin Leidy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old and tiresome , they depended on her . They depended on her to a greater extent than Mr. Minnestrat did . If it was n't for her , their terrible old house would have fallen in upon them long ago . But why should I prop up the house and them ? Gillian rebelled . They 're only second cousins , not my legal dependents . Seneth and Brosia practically ignore them . Of course I 've always remembered how fond Papa was of Cousin Waldo , but Papa was n't expected to loan him money every pay day . Gillian hopefully bashed in the crown of her atrocious hat which at once began to slide toward her neck . It hung on the back of her head when she reached the office , forming an unbecoming frame for her anxious , conscientious  | face . Mr. Orval had gone to lunch , but Mr. Philip , the junior partner , called to her from his private office . He had , he grumbled , been waiting for her to take an important letter for an hour . Irritation sharpened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fingers and feet . A short , dark man , bald at fifty-four , he cultivated nervous habits , but his tension concealed an inner calm . It usually pleased him to dictate with his watch held in his hand . " We hope to be able to arrange a conference with your husband 's attorneys ... " Gillian 's pencil flashed above , below , the ruled lines of her notebook . Twenty minutes late and he carries on like a spoiled baby . If he had his way , I 'd go without my lunch . Mr. Philip knew I was shopping for his wife . Never mind , they 'll both have a shock when I tell them I 'm resigning . " ... Since time is of the essence ... " I 'll call up Esther Royal tonight . No , morning is better . She 'll be gone before I can get away from here tonight . The whole trouble is , I 've spoiled Mr. Philip . He is n't willing for me to take time off to eat . I hope two weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to get some new clothes . She pushed absently at her hair , feeling the weight sliding to one side . Some new clothes and a bathroom to herself would do her more good than any of the silly tonics her sisters were fond of prescribing for her . Gillian reached this cheerful decision as she typed the letter and waited till late afternoon for Mr. Philip to return and sign it . Both Seneth and Brosia held the theory that a businesswoman needed to be diverted from her work . That their own type of shop talk bored Gillian as much as her chatter of the office wearied them  | occurred only to Hugh Kent , Brosia 's philosophical young husband . The background of a hotel , as Gillian imagined it , presented a minimum of domestic responsibility and the maximum of luxury in the form of plumbing , heat and light . Not only was Cousin Waldo 's house crumbling to ruin , but the Minnestrat and Minnestrat offices were located in an old building and lacked many modern conveniences . Only of course everyone knows the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of younger men who think they ca n't practice unless they rent an onyx and marble suite , Gillian reminded herself . Sometimes it 's a choice between putting everything on your hack and having a cash reserve . Still , it will be a relief to work in a building that does n't date from the Civil War . She was typing the third tentative copy of her resignation when Mr. Philip 's buzzer sounded . He pushed the signed correspondence toward her , but said , " Wait a minute , " when she would have left the room . He held his watch in his hand , kept his eyes fixed on the dial . " What do you know about cancer ? " he asked abruptly , after a moment that silence stretched as taut as an elastic band . " Cancer ? " " Well , tumors then . Any kind of growths . " Instantly alarm gathered , a dark cloud , in Gillian 's hazel eyes . " I do n't  --  that is ? do you mean cancer ? " " Sometimes I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philip Minnestrat said . He glanced up at the last word , his gaze clung to hers , seeking reassurance . In answer to her questions , he admitted that he had consulted a specialist , two of them in fact . But their diagnosis  | had been too glib , they had merely confirmed an idea he cherished , that doctors banded together to conceal the truth . " I have the feeling that I 'm a hopeless case , and they 're not going to let me know it . Jolly me along , dope me up toward the end , and ease me out before I ever learn what 's the matter with me . " The few medical books he had been able to consult , confirmed his observation of his symptoms . " An operation probably could n't save me . The brain tissues are delicate , a slip of the knife means paralysis , if not death . " Gillian listened , tried to shift his line of thought . Years of association with him had not reconciled her to his hypochondria ; he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But since she had been trained as a woman to professional cheerfulness , she considered it part of her job to help him , as often as necessary , to recover from his blue fits . She had learned to let him talk himself out of his dark fears , but she knew less about managing herself . Without attraction for him , she had gradually allowed herself to feel necessary to him and the satisfaction she derived from the administration of allopathic doses of sympathy and encouragement fed her unconscious maternal urge . He needs me , I could n't take a job in another office now . If anything should happen to him in one of his moods , I 'd never forgive myself . Perhaps his health is failing , seems to me I 've heard that men of his type burn themselves out . After all , it 's something to work for a man with a brilliant mind , and he 's known throughout the city as the brains of the firm . The fact that he had absented himself from the Mayor 's committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that afternoon at four , imposed on Gillian the necessity  | for inventing his excuse when the Mayor 's secretary telephoned . Philip Minnestrat accepted service on half a dozen civic and philanthropic boards , but failed lamentably in his attendance . In this instance his presence was required to make a quorum , but he had slipped through the door that connected his private office with the corridor and Gillian had not seen him go . She assured herself wrathfully that in all the fifteen years she had worked for him he had yet to keep her informed of his departures and his future moves . Sometimes I do n't see what he wants a secretary for . She hung up the receiver , pushed the tower of her hair into place . Bob Homan , the office boy , grinned . " A man 's got to save his energy , has n't lie ? When he gets rested , he 'll be hack . You 're lucky if you 're out of here by seven tonight . " Orval Minnestrat , a little precise , courteous always , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver gray of his hair , his gray suit and tired gray eyes , blended into a distinguished ensemble . Because Miss Fields had the information he sought instantly available in the file of her useful mind , Mr. Orval beamed . " I do n't know what this office would he without you . " He swung his glasses by their black cord , smiled kindly at a point on the wall just above her shoulder . Mr. Orval , twice married , still allowed women to make him feel shy . There 's some pleasure in working for a firm when they 're gentlemen and appreciate what you do for them . Gillian began indefinite preparations to close her desk . The risk of going to a new employer is that you ca n't tell anything about their traditions . Years ago hotel people were n't considered very steady , most of them were a little like stage  | people , I 've heard . No one needs ever hesitate to say she works for Minnestrat and Minnestrat , just look at the law students who are crazy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towel and the yellow celluloid case in which she kept her soap . Bob Homan left for the post office ; Mr. Orval said " Good night , " and marched erectly away to the enjoyment of his two-mile walk home . When a drizzle began to spatter the roofs visible from the office windows , which faced a threesided court , Gillian thought regretfully of his new topcoat . The lights hurt her eyes and reminded her that she ought to be tested for glasses . Dusk gathering saddened her , against her will she thought of the grave in St. Stephen 's Cemetery and of Frank Cleveland whose soul might be in Heaven , but whose body had not yet mingled with the earth . Exactly at five minutes past five Mr. Philip stepped out of the elevator , smiling , refreshed . He met Gillian in the hall , as she returned from the washroom . For the next hour and a half he dictated , interrupting himself to tell her stories about his wife and children and his new setter pup of whose pedigree he was proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped over to his club and read all the French magazines , but he did n't drink in the afternoon ? had healed his cares . When he glanced at his watch , to find he had fifteen minutes in which to drive himself home , he mentioned genially that the letters could be typed any time during the next day . No hurry at all . Her cousins would have finished dinner , and the plate of food placed in the oven for her did not seem worth haste . The air was cold , the pavements damp , but the rain held off . Gillian determined to walk home by way of the General  | Morris , the hotel she suspected , from Esther Royal 's guarded hints , to be the hotel . The very outlines of the building suggested comfort , Gillian thought . Light in unlimited , golden quantity , evenly heated rooms , cheerful , clean furnishings , could be glimpsed through the long doors of the lobby and behind the handsome moire draperies that outlined the sparkling windows . I declare I could about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to push her hair tinder her hat . If I had more gumption , I 'd walk in and ask them to show me a room with a bath . Pretend I planned to live here . This coat hikes up in the back , though , and people who sit on the sofas in hotels always stare at you so hard . The vision of the bathroom with adequate plumbing , and a Niagara of hot water gushing forth whenever she chose to turn a faucet , refused to fade . Past the hotel , through the quiet side streets , where none of the still houses showed more than one or two illuminated windows and the city 's dim arc lights made traps of the cracked pavements , Gillian picked her way , committed to a dream . All my life I 've wanted a bathroom to myself . It 's bad enough mornings to have to wait for Cousin Waldo to shave and then discover there is n't any hot water , but things are ten times worse at night . For years I 've shivered in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep Granny Jameson out . She hid the key as soon as they moved there , and Cousin Waldo never had another one made . I ca n't put on a bolt , because she might fasten herself in . Well , I 'm through . Why not ? I can take the new job , live in comfort , and perhaps Mr. Minnestrat will train himself to do his letters before five . He goes home to a hot dinner , for his wife holds  | it till he gets there . I have to eat Cousin Leidy 's dried-up cooking . She insists on using that horrible old cracked plate , too ! Because she wo n't risk a good plate in the oven heat . I can stand a few hotel meals , for a change . The trouble with me I 'm in a rut , she told herself firmly , groping her way through the dark , narrow hall to the kitchen where a crack of light gleamed under the door . She fumbled for the knob , heard Cousin Waldo cough . Do they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the next moment her petulance shamed her . They were so glad to see her , she represented their contact with the big , successful world . When Cousin Leidy was n't chopping frying potatoes in the skillet , she was chopping hash for breakfast . She sat with the wooden bowl between her knees and minced meat , potatoes , and onions , with a chopping knife that had not been sharpened for twenty years . At her elbow Cousin Waldo read his paper , scowling fiercely , for he could scarcely see the type . " It 's so cold and damp , we did n't go into the dining room tonight . The pot roast kind of warmed up the kitchen and it feels real comfortable , " Cousin Leidy said . She added that Gillian 's dinner was in the oven , her place had been left set at the table end . The old mother dozed in a rocker planted at a safe distance from a portable oilstove . The blaze of heat through the perforated top cast a shadow like a gigantic cutwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both doors and the three windows of the room closed , the smell of the wick , which needed trimming , mixed with the odor of lukewarm fat and the vitiated air , oppressed Gillian for the space  | of a breath . Then , her lungs adjusted , she was thankful to be warm and dry . But what dreary , ineffectual lives ! What is the matter with me tonight ? she questioned , picking distastefully at the gray , congealed mass of her food . Cousin Leidy 's cooking is as flat as her drab existence . No pepper , no salt , no flavor to anything she serves . All the seeds strained from the vegetables , all the blood washed out of the meat . ' Whatever she 's clone to her life , there 's no seasoning in it , either , Gillian thought , astonished to have discovered this . " ' There 's always something , they 're not content with taxing a man so he do n't own his own skin , they got to keep thinking up new ways to wring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created a mild commotion when he moved , for his knee struck the table leg and set the dishes to rattling . One lease of his eyeglasses had been mended with a bit of paper , and one of the silver bows was held in place with a strip of grimy tape so that he used elaborate care when he removed his spectacles lest they fail him completely . " Now I see the Government 's cooked up a scheme to make us buy mailboxes . Every house 's got to have a mailbox . The letter carriers ca n't be bothered to ring the bell any more . Too busy working for their pensions , I guess . " The bitter acrid smell of scorching woolen smoked in the air . " Ma ! Ma ! You 're too near the stove . Move back . Move back , I tell you . " Cousin Leidy flapped her apron to attract her mother 's attention . " You 're burning your skirt , Ma . " The old woman grumpily hitched her chair to one side . " Where 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost my shoes . " Gillian folded her coat over her arm , hung the felt mushroom  | on the great mound of her hair as the easiest way to carry the hat , and stood up . Yes , she had finished . No , thank you , she did n't want any dessert ? applesauce , as pale and watery as Cousin Leidy 's lemon-colored eyes . I ought to wash my dishes , Gillian reflected , they expect me to wait on myself . But she murmured something about changing her damp shoes and stumbled up the twisting , uncarpeted back stairs . In her own room , the faucets merely hissed at the discolored washbasin when she opened them . While the water ran in the kitchen sink it was impossible to get a drop on the second floor . It had happened a hundred times before , but tonight she had reached the end of submission . " I hate this house ! " She slammed her hat viciously against the wall above her bed . " I hate everyone in this house ! " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The devil ! Damn ! " There , she felt better . Hugh Kent , Brosia 's doctor husband , had once assured her , Gillian remembered , that he carefully taught some of his patients to swear . What a fool I 've been to muddle along here , when Seneth and Brosia and Hugh have been at me for years to make a change . I 'm not a complete fool , though . Not yet . This new job will be the lifesaver . I can explain to Cousin Leidy that I must live at the General Morris , that the room with bath and meals is part of my salary , so she 'll not feel hurt . Think of it , for the first time in my life I 'll have my time and money for myself . All the hot baths I want . A chance to give my skin and hair the extra care they need . Seneth and Brosia wo n't know me when I have some new clothes . I 'll invite them to dine with me . In the Marine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue , Brosia said . I 'm not really old at forty . No woman is . The water began to flow , a steady trickle from both taps .  | You ca n't tell hot from cold , Gillian thought , nothing 's one or the other in this crazy place . Neither sugar nor salt , neither in perfect condition nor a total loss . The gas jets in every room leak , but not sufficiently to asphyxiate you . Just enough to always smell vile and leave a brassy taste in your mouth . Cousin Leidy guiding her querulous old mother to bed woke Gillian an hour later . Granny Jameson was complaining that she had cramps in her legs , that she was cold . Cousin Leidy retorted that old persons ruined their health by sitting huddled over stoves . It made them so tender that a breath of unheated air chilled their blood . The heavy , shuffling steps of the two women dragged past Gillian 's closed door . Gillian unrolled herself from her blanket , lighted the gas . The brief nap had refreshed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did when the morning alarm went off . Through the thin partition she could hear the murmur of voices in the next room , the thud of a bed pushed against the wall . Old Mrs. Jameson feared sleep unless she could press her shrunken body against a firm support . I hate the movies , Gillian found herself thinking unexpectedly , but Cousin Leidy ought to have a bit of pleasure . What I want to do is to stay in and read the paper , with my feet up on a chair . Only there 's Cousin Leidy who does n't get out at all during the day and I 'm sure Granny is enough to drive a saint mad . Suddenly Gillian 's mind began to drive with a precision and speed that conferred a sense of power and calm . I 'm going away from here , but Cousin Leidy will never escape . I 'll take her to the movies , I 'll do nice little things for her , because I 'm sorry for her . Not sorry for myself .  | I shall never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe , to be waking up at my age , but I really believe I 've learned to order my life . A new start , a new job , a new home , and no more waste of my energy and time . Unconscious of her action , Gillian turned to the mirror above her dresser , stared unseeingly at her flushed face , shadowed by the drift of her thick hair . Intent , heedless of her image , she straightened the collar of her dress , rumpled in her sleep . I 'm moving forward , I 'm being carried along . A disinclination to stand still , which she did not stop to examine , urged her to fling up the window beside the bureau , and she raised the frame with a crash . The limp curtains billowed into the room like sails and the faint patter of quiet rain tapped in even , gentle beats on the surrounding roofs . " Where 's my shoes ? " In the next room old Mrs. Jameson awoke from a doze . Cold , damp , the fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till it sputtered in heavy gasps . Gillian watched it with that unseeing , steady gaze that carried her beyond the blue and yellow flame . Cousin Leidy , unable to attend the movies unless she first changed her dress and brushed her hair and lifted her good hat from its box on the closet shelf , scuttled from bedroom to bathroom in jubilant haste . Gillian , sitting down to wait on the lowest step of the linoleum-covered front stairs  --  heavens , heavens , how she loathed the smell of oilcloth and the silly , tarnished stars that tacked it in place ? let the ringing of the telephone startle her . She had had it installed , but they had so few friends . . . Could anything have happened to Seneth ? Or to Brosia ?  | " Miss Fields , I 'm terribly sorry to bother you . " Philip Minnestrat 's voice , diplomatic , suave . There was a letter he 'd overlooked , she would find his memorandum in the upper right-hand drawer of his desk . If she typed it and mailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mailbox on the corner , was there not ? " It 's vital to have this in the mails tonight . Inconceivably careless in me to have let it go . I 'd come down myself , but my wife is having some people in ? " Gillian said , " I have an ? an engagement for the evening . " He assured her that nothing , except the deepest need , could have induced him to trespass on her free time . Before calling her he had hesitated , but he had remembered that she had never failed him yet . " I said to my wife , Miss Fields is the only one who can save the day . ' You have the keys ? you 'll help me out , I know you will . Why , if it was n't for you ? " Who is it ? " Cousin Leidy , halfway down the stairs , directed her whisper at her husband standing in the dining room doorway . Gillian murmured , pawing ineffectively at the folds of Cousin Waldo 's raincoat which swung into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute , Mr. Minnestrat ? I 'll have to explain . " He said something , but the words fell back into the receiver as she put it down . Briefly she outlined the situation to her cousins in a low tone . " Well ? do just as you think best , of course . " Cousin Leidy rubbed her hand up and down the banister rail . Her head , and on it her best hat , drooped . He 'd take her himself , Cousin Waldo comforted his wife , pulling down his vest , if it was n't that someone must stay with Mother Jameson.  | They act about ten years old , Gillian thought , but Philip Minnestrat is just as silly , in his way . He 's sending me out in the rain to type a letter that could wait . I know it could wait . He 's done this before . Why should n't he forget , if he knows he can count on me to clean up after him ? Never the offer of taxi fare either , nor the hint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This settles it . Esther Royal 's saved my reason and my life . " We see so little of you . " Cousin Leidy spoke primly , like someone in a book . To her horror , Gillian heard herself say , " Oh , hell ! " They all want something out of me , they do n't give a ? a damn about me , really . It 's what I can do for them , day in and day out . Cousin Waldo looks like a fool , jerking his vest . It has a grease spot on one pocket , I can see it from here . I 'm not going to the office on a night like this and hunt out those notes . Mr. Philip 's never put anything where he said he did , yet . He 's a parasite , that 's what he is , a parasite ! But he 's sucked all the blood out of me he ever will . She picked up the receiver . " I 'm sorry to have kept you waiting , Mr. Minnestrat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your kindness in a burry , you may be sure of that . I hope you included my humble apologies in your explanation , Miss Fields . Yes , indeed , I 've told my wife forty times that there would n't be any law firm , if it was n't for you and your quick , clear mind . You wo n't let me down on this , will you ? Not after all the years we 've worked together , eh ? " After a moment 's silence , Gillian said mechanically : " No , I suppose not . In the upper right-hand drawer of your personal desk ? Are you sure ? "  | OUTSIDE the Y.W.C.A. building the newsboys screeched . " Extra ! Extra ! Read about the big battle ! Germany reports . . , killed and wounded ! " They folded the first page in to defeat the efforts of the women hurrying past them to read the tall , black headlines . Let the cheap dames buy a nape . " As long as we do n't get into it . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rickety elevator in the tiled foyer worried . " Would n't you think after two years of fighting , that something would be settled one way or another ! " Their resentful comments covered uneasiness and fear . " I do n't read the papers any more . . . " " The letters from my sister in Canada are so gloomy . . . " The call of the newsboys stretched thin and fine as the cage wobbled up the shaft . " They just get out extras to sell more papers . " Mart , the faded middle-aged operator , glanced kindly at his passengers , consciously superior as the only male . He flung back the gate at the cafeteria entrance on the fifth floor . The table Gillian Fields had reserved , in her capacity of president of the Businesswomen 's Club , had been set in a corner of the long , brown-paneled room . The cafeteria used no cloths , even for dinner , but a small glass vase holding four carnations had been placed in the center of the varnished top . Eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already arrived . Millie Ramer steered a guest to Gillian . " Miss Bates , who is spending the night with me . She 's really filling in for Anna Stevens ? Anna telephoned me she has the grippe . " Millie had already provided her friend with a tray . In the confusion attendant upon the march to the steam tables and back , the fastidious grouping of the food dishes at each individual place ? every woman made a point of spreading out paper napkins to serve as table mats ? Gillian retained no clear impression of Miss Bates . When , from her seat at the head of the table , she did glance at the guest , she perceived her to be much the youngest woman present . Miss Bates 's round cheeks were thickly daubed with rouge ; lipstick outlined the curves of an artistic cupid 's bow . Rouge was being used more and more , Gillian admitted to herself ( in fact she suspected that her own sister Brosia heightened her naturally good color , though Brosia kept the details secret ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think ? " Helen Holmes , on Gillian 's left , had tears in her eyes , having swallowed a spoonful of scalding hot soup . " Her hair 's cut ! You can see it when she turns her head . Bobbed . It makes her look like a boy . " Undignified for a woman , a businesswoman , disapproved Martha Potter , on Gillian 's right . Silly , too , to take up with every passing fad . " Miss Ramer told me she also smokes . " Although they had been business friends for a decade , the club members frowned upon the use of first names as in poor taste . Englishwomen smoked , Helen Holmes murmured , trying not to stare at the amazing Miss Bates , who sat too far away  | to hear . " After all , this is 1916 , not 1880 , " Miss Holmes observed with a not quite convincing tolerance . Martha Potter buttered a slice of brown bread , folded it . " I hope I 'm not uncharitable , but I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's so unfeminine . " " Her husband ? Did you say her husband ? Why , she is n't married ! " Voices protested , discreetly muted . Certainly Miss Bates was a married woman , Martha Potter asserted , she had been married five or six years . It was considered " new " to retain the maiden name . Lots of women did that now . In New York . They left off their wedding rings , too . " Miss Ramer told me she did n't believe at first that respectable women would do such things , but now she 's used to it . You know she spends a great deal of her time in New York and anyway she 's very broad-minded . I always say frankly that I do n't think married women should work . " Gillian found her eyes returning to the animated features of Miss Bates throughout the progress of the sedate meal . The visitor looked very young to have been married six years . Perhaps the short hair contributed to the childish outline of her round face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collar fitted closely about her throat , a sailor hat pushed back on her head . She probably did n't have much hair in the first place , so she cut it , Gillian mused , conscious of her own heavy mass . I wonder whether this Miss Bates has a good position ? most employers have no confidence in a woman employee who paints . What to do with their evening , dessert finished , perplexed the members of the Businesswomen 's Club . A few of the  | more vigorous ? among them Miss Bates and her hostess ? decided in favor of the gymnasium and a swim in the pool . Others vaguely mentioned the Public Library , which would be open till half-past nine o'clock . Helen Holmes had tickets for a travel lecture . They stood for a moment in the lobby , looking at each other rather helplessly . " I feel that I ought to run up to see my sister , Mrs. Cleveland . She 's just buried her husband . " Gillian , with a destination , could decently break away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they walk . Martha , a huge woman who dressed untidily , was a lawyer and a good one . She stopped on the top step to pin up her skirt hem , and far away the call of a newsboy crying another extra echoed in the quiet , dim street . " I hate them ? extras , I mean . " Martha rocked sideways down the steps . " Do n't you lie awake nights , worrying about the war ? " She had three young brothers , old enough for service , Martha revealed . Her aunt remembered the Civil War as a little girl . " It would n't be so bad , if they did n't have extras out so often . You ca n't forget there 's a war . " Beside her Gillian must take two hurried steps to keep up with Martha 's stride . Their footfalls echoed in the silence that seemed to blanket the shadowy street , their quiet voices rang so strangely clear that they hesitated to speak . Closed doors , drawn shades in the houses they passed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper had predicted frost , Gillian murmured , holding the lapels of her coat together to form a scarf . We have no men to send to war , she thought . Again , endlessly , she repeated , Seneth 's boys are years too young , Hugh Kent has a clubfoot . But Philip Minnestrat has sons , and Mr. Orval has at least one . " My  | sister Brosia knows a woman who lives in Canada . She wrote her that a next-door neighbor has lost her husband and five sons in the war already . Think of it , five sons ! " Martha Potter whispered gloomily that the finest young men were the first to be lost . In the Civil War mere lads had enlisted as drummer boys . " My aunt had a twelve-yearold beau who went . She gave him a rose , but she never saw him again . " Farther away , faint and intermittent like the expiring rattle of thunder , the newsies ' cries rolled back on the cold stream of the wind . " I 'll be glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halted in the radiance of a drugstore 's glow . She took the car here , she explained . " I think you ca n't help feeling depressed , when your feet are cold . If I take home a paper I wo n't let the boys see it  --  they think the war is exciting , but my mother ca n't sleep . " Seneth lived in a cheerful-looking red brick house with an English basement , a high , brownstone stoop , and spotless white shutters and sills . Mrs. Cleveland was in the upstairs sitting room , Angie the maid , who did all the work in the fourteen rooms , informed Gillian , answering her ring . To reach the long flight of stairs , curved like a question mark , Gillian must pass the parlor where the funeral had been held . She fancied the heavy , cloying scent of flowers still lingered in the folds of the moss-green portieres , fought an inclination to whisper when she stooped for Seneth 's kiss . At her solid , handsome knee-hole desk , placed to face the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white bands at her neck and wrists , appeared younger than  | her thirty-eight years . Her torso was deceptively slim , for when she rose to snap on the side-lights she revealed extremely wide hips which effectively destroyed her silhouette . Seneth took great pride in her figure ; she frequently called attention to the breadth of her pelvis . A woman should be wide , she asserted , to be able to bear children properly . Her fine dark eyes smiling at her sister , she said : " Everyone 's in bed , Gil . I 'm glad to have them back on their schedule , they 're returning to their regular habits now . " By everyone , she meant her brood . The room , square with a high ceiling , had crimson wallpaper embossed in a design of roses as large as cabbages in a darker red . The effect was not unpleasing as a background for the walnut and mahogany pieces that combined harmoniously Colonial and Chinese chippendale lines . A worn rug , patterned indistinctly , covered most of the floor . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net . Narrow side curtains of crimson repp outlined the window frames . Seneth 's desk allowed her to sit with her back to a hot-air register let into the wall . She loved to be warm , Seneth often declared , and tonight Gillian was thankful for the blast of heat . " Cousin Leidy wo n't let Cousin Waldo start the furnace yet . " Gillian folded her coat over the arm of a plain little sofa the color of a limedrop and about as hard . " Their house is like a barn . " It would be the same , furnace fire or no furnace fire , Seneth 's musical voice pronounced . She leaned forward in her straight desk chair to frown at Gillian who stood before the mantel mirror tucking stray ends of hair into the main knot . Why Gillian insisted on camping out permanently with  | the Youngs was beyond her comprehension , Seneth protested . Her fingers twisted a gold chain that gleamed against the dull black of her dress . This was her favorite ornament , she wore it almost constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth , which she had carefully saved . " There 's no reason now why you should n't come and live with me . " Seneth fluttered the papers on her desk . Her complexion , always bad , showed red blotches over forehead and chin . " Heaven knows this house is large enough . We ? I keep it warm , too . " She does n't want me . Gillian sank into the enormous old chair at one end of the desk , rested her elbows on the shiny arm where the kids had climbed and kneeled . She does n't want me , but she feels she ought to ask me to come . I could , I suppose , now that I 've told Esther Royal to forget the hotel job . Seneth would probably give me the third floor front room , the one with the alcove . If I gave Angie a little something extra , she would n't mind my early breakfast ? and how Angie can cook ! From the register heat breathed in an even flow . The mantel clock ticked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly as if experimentally tried by the wind . Seneth tried to estimate how many cards and letters she had still to acknowledge , reminded herself that this was not the matter in hand . I have enough to do , with four children to bring up and a house to manage , but Gillian is my sister . I ought to do something for her . Leidy Young could n't make a rabbit comfortable and a rabbit at least has a fur coat . I know Gil suffers every winter in that ghastly house . She 'll upset the children , Angie will have to plan a separate schedule for her hours ? I do n't know , it  | may not be wise . Aloud she said : " This house is so large . There 's plenty of room . " " I know . " Gillian shifted a wire hairpin which gouged her scalp . If only she could provide for her helpless cousins , perhaps find them a boarder , then leave them with her conscience crystal-clear . No boarder , she admitted , would remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or inability to escape . If they did n't have me , they 'd have no one , and they do need the money I pay . Seneth is all right , Frank has provided for her , and besides she 's a born manager . Cousin Leidy is a born muddler , but that 's her misfortune . " You see , I never can forget how fond Papa was of Cousin Waldo , Seneth . I have the feeling that Papa would wish me to do what I can for them . Living with them is about all I can do . They know I have to live somewhere , and I suppose they think it is no more than fair for me to board there and help them along . " Seneth retorted that a boarder was n't expected to pay the butcher and baker and candlestick-maker . But she was eager to discuss her own plans ; Gillian 's objections relieved her . Better , she assured herself , to keep the home solely for the children . They needed no one except their mother for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is anything I can do ? " Gillian , looking at her widowed sister , detected no signs of helplessness , weariness , or even grief . Seneth 's a born manager , I do n't believe Frank ever gave an order . If one of them had to go , it 's lucky for the children it was n't Seneth ? Frank would have been lost without her . Everything was done , Seneth asserted competently , glancing at the papers sorted into orderly piles on her desk . The  | photographs of her children , four pictures framed as one in a border of oxidized silver , fenced one corner of the blotter pad . If she could have an uninterrupted morning tomorrow , Seneth murmured , she could finish the letters and cards . " Frank 's lawyer took up most of this afternoon . It seems there is a good deal of detail to be handled , even though Frank and I made our wills years ago . Mr. Bell kept asking me about my plans . I think twenty people have asked me what I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loosely on her finger as she sorted envelopes and notes . " Do you know what you 're going to do ? " Gillian spoke with some effort , for she had realized for what she had been waiting  --  waiting ever since she had entered the house . Waiting for Frank to walk into the room , or to call to Seneth , or to rattle his paper in his den across the hall . I did n't see him for weeks at a time , and yet now it seems so queer not to smell his tobacco smoke . I should think Seneth would go wild . I 'd move out of this house . Frank 's widow , her eyes on the four young faces gazing so supremely confident into space , said , " There 's only one thing for me to do , is n't there ? I have to be father and mother to my children now . I shall devote my entire life ? what remains of it ? to them . Four children to be educated and trained furnish a task for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , but Seneth continued placidly to sort her cards . Yes , of course , Gillian agreed , a mother with four children faced great responsibilities . Seneth never wanted to be anything except a mother . I remember that funny teacher who roomed next door to us when we lived with Auntie ?  | that man was wild about Seneth 's voice and offered to give her singing lessons . Seneth laughed at him . She was in love with Frank then , and she said no girl had time for music after she was married . No one could argue with Seneth ? she made her plans , then went ahead . The sound of Angie shoveling coal into the furnace echoed hollowly in the register as if from the pit of a mine . Anyway , thought Gillian , I always had a lot more hair than Seneth . Hers was straggly and thin , and it 's falling out worse than ever now . Seneth 's voice reached her with suddenly increased clarity as if an unseen door had opened between them . " ... So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never disappoint me . It will be the five of us against the world . " Brosia and Hugh Kent , whose evening did n't begin until after the doctor 's office hours , came over at ten o'clock . Gillian had been ready to leave , but she lingered to help Seneth make coffee and set out crackers and cheese . Angie had just gone up to bed , taking her alarm clock set for six-thirty , or she would have been delighted to wait on the doctor and his wife . " The waiting room was crowded tonight , " Brosia volunteered . Like most young physicians ' wives she made all the professional allusions for both . It usually annoyed Gillian to be seated at the same table with Brosia , for even the simplest meal . Youngest and by far the best-looking of the three sisters , Brosia insisted on wearing the garments of humility with such sweeping effect that they often interfered with the exercise of her more natural charms . It distressed Gillian to be forced into the  | most comfortable chair , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night , but Brosia insisted she take a heaping measure of cream . It sometimes seemed to her that Brosia need not express such incessant anxiety for the welfare of others in order to be utterly forgetful of herself , but this had always been the method Brosia followed in her efforts to please . Gillian knew she scattered little notes of apology almost daily among her friends , begging their forgiveness for some fancied neglect or slight , imploring them to allow her to make amends . " Did I take the last peanut wafer ? Oh , I 'm so sorry , Seneth . You should have stopped me ? that 's your favorite tidbit I know . " Wide-eyed , distressed , Brosia bowed her head as if in shame . Opposite her the doctor , her husband , contentedly built up an imposing sandwich of ham and American cheese . Hugh was rather selfish , Brosia 's sisters said , a little too ready to let his pretty wife wait on him . He had eaten two sandwiches before Brosia tasted her coffee , but then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table did not leave her much chance to cat . " Coffee will keep you awake , Hugh , you ought to get to sleep early , in case you have a night call , " she said gently , her tone pitched distinct and low . One of Hugh Kent 's black eyebrows sedately followed the natural curve of the eye socket , the other grew erratically in the shape of a sharply inverted V. The perpetual cocked angle imparted a quizzical expression to his thin , dark face , even when he was serious of mind . He said now , " Let 's take the coffee and let the night calls go . " The smiling glance of his light gray eyes , deepset above his high cheekbones , touched Brosia , Seneth , Gillian , in turn .  | At quarter of eleven Brosia insisted they must go . They had to take Gillian home .. . " You do not . I do n't need anyone to go home with me . " The silk strands of Brosia 's bronze hair spun fine tendrils that clung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glowed , a radiant , slim figure in her long , tight-fitting suit , gentle , patient , firm . " It is n't out of our way . Hugh needs the fresh air , after being cooped up in that office all day . Do n't you , dear ? " She pulled at the finely tucked frill of her blouse to bring it out between the edges of her coat . Her hands , large , noticeably thick , the fingers stubby and red , moved with hesitating clumsiness . Hugh Kent studied the revolting picture of dead rabbits that Seneth kept on the dining room wall because to her mother it had represented Art . " Maybe Gillian would rather take herself home . Quicker . " He stayed seated as long as possible , because he hated to bring his built-up shoe into sight . Her sister could n't go home alone at this hour and the sooner they all started the better , Brosia announced in her gentle reproving tone . There might come a time when they could n't see Gillian home , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may buy a practice in the suburbs . Everyone says that 's the field for a young doctor . " Brosia did not add that the practice , if bought , would be purchased with her money . Her sisters knew that Hugh had n't a cent to his name . Brosia had put him through medical school . She adored him . Whatever he might do , he would owe it all to her . When they were in the trolley , Brosia mentioned that she  | had a blinding headache . She would be all right as soon as she could take a hot bath and lie down . She made Gillian take the only vacant double seat with Hugh , while she sat with a greasy fat woman who smelled gustily of garlic . Brosia worried after they left the car . " I thought perhaps you were in a direct draft , Gil . You do n't think you 've taken cold , do you ? It was stupid of me not to think of the draft . " All through the winter that followed her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustained her so adequately as to amaze her friends . She faced life for her children , she explained with a serenity that deceived herself . " I need a spiritual force outside myself for help , " she said to her rector after the church services she now attended , with her four fatherless youngsters , far more regularly than when her husband had lived . It ruffled her that Hugh Kent , in his capacity of family physician , offered her no word of praise . She liked men , Seneth thought , without realizing that she meant men safely married to other women . Her rector , Doctor Rodd , and Mr. Bell , her attorney , understood her conception of duty , they assured her that in years to come she would receive her reward . Only Hugh questioned her motives , disapproved of her ordered days , derided her sacrifice . Seneth resented his brusqueness , but endured his criticism for Brosia 's sake . " God Almighty , Seneth , you 're heading for disaster , like a toboggan going downhill . " Hugh would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , tearing paper into thin strips . " Just what do you expect me to do ? " " Go out more . Keep your friends . " " I 'm in mourning for my husband . Besides , I have four  | children and the house . And do n't forget , only one servant . " " Three of your children go to school . Kit should be in kindergarten . In a few years they wo n't need you . Then what will you do ? " " I shall find a new life in their lives . A man like you ca n't be expected to understand . " Seneth 's beautiful voice would vibrate , her hand seek the gold chain which dangled little teeth on her breast . When in April the United States entered the war , Brosia complained to Hugh that Seneth refused to join the surgical dressings class which met in the basement of Christ Episcopal Church . " She says she 's too busy . I guess if Gillian , who works in an office all day , can come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is perfectly competent to stay with the children . " Brosia frowned , then smiled as she saw her reflection in the oval glass hung above the mantel in Hugh 's reception room . She had stopped in on her way to the Tuesday night class , and she wore her Red Cross veil . The drapery set off her fair pointed face , and she had rolled back her bronze hair to form a narrow , burnished ruche . " Goodness knows it is n't easy for me to find the time , either , but I go , " Brosia said . " Possibly that expresses the attitude of the men who are going over . " Hugh tilted back wearily in his swivel chair . His eyebrow quirked , but his mouth was hard . His wife sighed . She hated to leave him alone , she murmured , the doorbell would be sure to ring every minute if he had to answer it himself , but how could she stay away from the class ? They had promised to complete a definite number of dressings every month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind . " When you think of the need ?  | all those men wounded on the battlefields , and not enough bandages  --  well , Mrs. Rodd said we 'd be slackers if we did n't do a little more than our share . " Brosia smoothed her white . uniform , which fitted her because she had insisted that the shop alter it . Some of the women did n't care how they looked , but no matter at what Brosia worked she must be satisfied with her clothes . She had paid a good deal for her nurse 's frock , but then the war might last a good time and she would get the good of it . Or it could always be worn as a house dress . " You 'll forgive me if I have to neglect you now and then , I high ? Not deliberately , of course , only when I have to give a little time , do my tiny part to help win the war ? " She rested one hand , thick , inflexible , on his shoulder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long it 's natural now . Hugh rose at the buzzing ring of the doorbell . He limped into his adjoining office , closed the door . Brosia , the Red Cross veil swirled gracefully about her throat , floated over the rug with her cultivated , gliding step to admit the patient at the side door . The murmur of her voice asking her courteous , stock questions annoyed her husband , who was , he reproved himself , an ungrateful brute . Suppose she does n't give a damn how old Mason 's cold is , any more than she gives a damn whether the surgical dressings she rolls ever reach a wounded man or not  --  what of it ? Hugh , washing his hands in the tiny lavatory behind a screen , splashed as vigorously as the cramped space allowed . Suppose she is n't really interested in anything under God 's sun except some picture of herself that she 's conceived as absolute and ideal . She 's got to pretend to be interested , has n't she ? Because her ideal woman must be washed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self satisfies the horrible fear that takes the place of a soul in most women . All women , I guess . Hugh dried his hands on the towel . You do n't mean that , do you ? Yes , I do . Brosia has n't a soul . Nor Seneth , nor poor old Gillian , God help her . Instead of a soul each has a fear . He opened the door communicating with the reception room . " Good evening , Mr. Mason . No , you 're not too early , you 're exactly on time . Come in . " Seneth 's obstinate refusal to see her patriotic duty still rankled when the next morning Brosia brought in the breakfast toast . She kept house meticulously , with such attention to detail that she remained the wonder and despair of brides , although she had been married eight years . If in her desire to have her charming table appointments appreciated , her delicious food savored , she prolonged the mealtime a little tediously , no one could justly find fault . She did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the run as so many doctors did , she would say , urging a third cup of her delicious coffee , insisting on making a fresh supply of toast . This morning as usual she poured a thimbleful of heavy cream into her coffee , pushed the pitcher toward Hugh . " No thanks . " " Hugh ! And I ordered it especially for you . " " Use it yourself . You took scarcely a teaspoonful . " Hugh stirred his coffee , drank it black . " But , dear , you love heavy cream . Pour it on your cereal , do . Why must you make me so unhappy ? " " Must you go without cream in order to be happy ? I 'm sick of being fed tidbits like a prize pig . Every morning  | you 're ready to cry if I do n't wallow in heavy cream while you take blue milk . " " I prefer milk . " " Under the circumstances , so do I. Better notify the dairy and we 'll save money . " Brosia 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She detested vulgar scenes , her breakfast table ought to set the keynote for the entire day . In order not to allow the silence to become significant , she must think quickly of some neutral topic , trust Hugh to follow her lead . " Seneth acts as if there was n't a war . She wo n't even knit . She keeps saying she has to sew for the children . Why , everyone we know does something , Hugh . Look at you , with your first aid classes and the dozens of volunteers you examine without pay . " If he did his duty , he 'd warn each man he examined to stay out of the crazy mess , Hugh declared , adding sadly that most of them would confuse moral courage with his bum foot . " Only the misfits are brave enough to stay at home . " He 's determined to be difficult , Brosia thought , he never used to be so odd . Sometimes I think medical school destroyed all his faith . A lovely feeling of patience renewed flowed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been hurt she could usually summon this soft , healing glow that relieved her unhappiness . " But whether we believe in war or not , we have to take care of our army , Hugh . Women who have no men to give , should give their money and time . Gillian thinks so , too . " Hugh had swung around from the table to rest his elbows on his knees . Head supported in his hands , he stared at his maimed foot . " Brosia , do you envy women who have a son to  --  what is the phrase ? ? to give to their country ? "  | Her exquisite , still face did not quicken , but she said raptly , " I 'd be proud to give a son to the cause of Liberty , I think . " Well , she 's heard them say that , these women who have sons , Hugh mused . " What are you thinking about , Hugh ? " " The appalling waste of sacrifice , if you must know . And of the appalling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a waste , Brosia said . If selfishness had ruined the world , sacrifice alone could save it . " You know I do n't like you to be hard and bitter , Hugh . " His gray eyes studied the platters and mugs arranged on the plate rail . The shelf always reminded him of a track , its circuit broken by the moldings that framed the two windows . Why not carry the plate rail over the tops of the windows and down on the other side , to save that choppedoff effect , Hugh mused . He folded his napkin and his eyebrow shot up as he smiled at his wife . " How would you like me to save Seneth ? I 've got a plan and , by George , it might work . " What Seneth needed , Hugh explained , was a new interest . " Shall we say a new husband ? " When Brosia protested that neither she nor Seneth approved of second marriages ? " There can be only one real love in a woman 's life , " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of , Hugh appeared pleased . " It 's the children I 'm thinking of . " He fumbled for his cigarettes , struck a match . " Get Seneth 's attention centered on a man and the kids will have a chance to breathe . " Cousin Leidy , who knitted socks as fervently and inexpertly as she did everything else , took the heels of her tenth pair to Christ Church parish house to have them  | " set " by the champion knitter of the Altar Guild . She brought home a box of wool for Cousin Waldo to wind as his contribution toward winning the war , and an exciting bit of news she could scarcely wait to tell Gillian . In July the narrow slice of side porch was a degree cooler than the house in the early evening , though its moldy floor boards and depressing view of the blank , whitewashed wall of the next house did not sustain Cousin Leidy 's references to it as an " outdoor living room . " After dinner the two women took their knitting here and Cousin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocking chairs almost filled the tiny space . The smell of the ( lamp bricks that paved the alley to the street , and made a cross in the center of the tiny square yard where the sun seldom shone , mingled with that of the lime Cousin Waldo sprinkled hopefully year after year to sweeten the sour earth . Inside the house old Mrs. Jameson scuffled from room to room , sometimes talking to herself . " Mrs. Hayes told me she would n't be surprised if your sister Seneth was to get married again . " Cousin Leidy had had to wait for Gillian , detained later than usual at the office tonight . " You heard anything about it ? " Only what Brosia had told her , Gillian admitted , twitching the heap of ugly khaki-colored wool into position on her lap . Brosia and Hugh had had a man guest for dinner some weeks ago , when Seneth had also been a guest . He had driven her home in his car . " He 's been to her house for dinner several times , Brosia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Seneth ought to snap him up , Cousin Leidy declared , inspecting her complicated arrangement of steel needles ,  | then consulting the printed directions on which she blindly relied . When the war had killed off all the men , Seneth might be sorry to find she 'd let a good provider slip through her fingers . " Besides , a woman her age , with all those children , wo n't meet so many willing to marry her . What 's his name ? " " David . " No , she had n't heard his last name . Gillian sighed . Her back ached . The office was short-handed , four men had enlisted , she was doing work for the outside office every day , in addition to looking after Mr. Orval and Mr. Philip . But she had had a raise . They expected her to train the new girl clerks , too , the ones coming in to replace the men . " They say there 'll be a fuel shortage next winter . " Cousin Waldo rattled his paper , cleared his throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war . " Behind Gillian 's chair-back , lips pressed close to the window screen , old Mrs. Jameson whined . " Where 's my shoes ? I ca n't find my shoes . " The struggle to knit frayed Cousin Leidy 's nerves . Small and prim and gray , when she went to pieces it was as if a mouse had exploded . Gillian and Cousin Waldo thought nothing of Cousin Leidy 's angry scream . " Your shoes are on your feet ! " Then , as her mother moved away , she calmed . " I guess maybe Seneth hangs back for fear he wo n't be good to the children . " " Maybe . " Gillian thought , you can tell Hugh and Brosia do n't agree about Seneth . Hugh acts as if he 'd marry her off to anyone who comes along , but he 'll find he has a strong character to deal with . Seneth 's dedicated her life to her children , it 's almost as if she had taken a vow . She and  | Brosia are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an ideal . Hugh 's mistaken when he thinks it a pose . They 're both good . Brosia is too fussy , sometimes , Seneth riles me when she assumes that a woman who has n't a child must be a fool ; but if either was a hypocrite , I 'd be the first to know . They 're good , they would never do anything wrong , they believe in God . " When you get old , you want a husband or a child beside you , " Cousin Waldo said . He heard only fragments of the conversation , for he was growing deaf . A toad hopped from the shadow of the fence line boldly to the center of the walk , where he went into a trance . Gillian stared at his motionless outline , rigid as a lump of coal . Knit two , burl two . The arm of Cousin Waldo 's rocker touched her on the right , the arm of Cousin Leidy 's chair sculled hers on the left . In the house Granny Jameson wandered aimlessly , occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purl two . That toad must have died . He has n't even quivered since he landed there . I 'm giving the best years of my life to the office . Well , that 's something . Mr. Philip says I 'm his right hand , and I 'm sure it 's necessary in these times to look after the details for an overworked , brilliant lawyer . Cousin Leidy and Cousin Waldo depend on me , too . Seneth has the children , Brosia lives only for Hugh  --  women have to feel that they 're needed . I ca n't make Hugh see that . If this David needs Seneth more than her children do , she may marry him , but from what Brosia says he 's very successful and used to looking out for himself . Knit two , purl two . Gillian said aloud , " Good gracious , he hopped ! The toad , I mean . So he was n't dead . "  | Seneth , who scorned war work , received the reports of the gossip that accompanied it placidly and without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commented ; Frank had not been dead a year . The chatter of these idle tongues must not reach her children , otherwise she cared little about what people said of her . " My children trust me utterly , they ca n't conceive of me failing them , " she explained to Brosia in the hope that Brosia would explain to Hugh . " I 've been reading a lot of psychology since Frank 's death and I 've learned it 's quite possible to destroy a child 's faith in his mother , if the mother marries a second time . " Hugh persistently embarrassed her . Heckled her , she indignantly reflected , as if she were an officeholder and threatened the security of his interests . She said something like this to him one midsummer evening when she had sent for him to see Kit . The small boy had run a temperature and Seneth had immediately canceled a dinner invitation extended to David Knight . " How can I be interested in small talk when my baby is ill ? " she flung at Angie when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The three other children , Rhodes , Mary and Lettice , had been sent down to the dining room to eat their dinner , with Angie to wait on them . Kit lay in Seneth 's wide bed , in her cool , high-walled bedroom on the second floor . Seneth latched the door gently as she followed Hugh to the square landing , eager to be reassured . She had hesitated to ask Hugh to drive into the city , ? he and Brosia had moved to the suburbs , ? but she never dared take a chance with Kit . " He 's the kind of child who wo n't say how he  | feels . I have to watch him and guess . Will he be all right in the morning , do you think ? " The gold chain with its tiny ivory points swung out from the yoke of her black-andwhite print frock as she leaned forward to look down the stairwell . Angie had a habit of leaving the first floor hall dark on a summer night . She insisted it cooled the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lemonade again , the doctor asserted , but his stomach would settle after a night 's sleep . " David having dinner with the kids ? No reason why you should n't go down . Kit 's asleep already . " She had telephoned Mr. Knight not to come , Seneth explained , noticing that Hugh had lost weight as he always did in the heat . There was a chest in the hall , where she stored summer blankets in case of a weather change , and she urged him to rest there a moment , seating herself beside him . " Stay and dine , Hugh ? The children will be so pleased . " " Thanks , but I 'm ( Inc at a meeting and I 'll have to rush back to dress . I 'm likely to be a Home Guard any time now . David said any more about enlisting ? Or was that just a feeler ? " Seneth said in her lovely voice , " I think it 's absurd for a man of forty-five to talk about serving in the army . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not that I presume to advise him . " Her dark eyes glanced at the door of her bedroom . She wanted to go in to Kit . " Why do n't you marry Knight ? " " Why should I ? I 've had marriage ? "  | In spite of himself Hugh said , " If that 's what you call it , " and was immediately a little ashamed . The narrow shoulders beside him straightened . She and Frank had been very happy together , they had had four children . . . Seneth hesitated . " Exactly . Well , there 's more to marriage than children . " Frigid , of course . And Frank not knowing how to handle her . She wanted kids , not him . I 'll bet her idea was that every other time she sacrificed her body to his brute lust . The only reason she might marry again , if she did marry again , would be in order to have more children , Seneth declared , smiling as if some secret dream pleased her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was meant to be a fruitful woman , I 'm built wide . " Before the doctor could reply , the telephone rang . Angie climbed the stairs with the message ? Mr. Knight would like to drop in later in the evening , to inquire about Kit . Seneth acquiesced , but did not go down to the phone . She feared the ringing of the bell had wakened the sick child , and she wanted to take his temperature before the doctor left . The war winter was significant to Seneth only because it was the second since her husband 's death . The coal bins in her large cellar had been amply stored , so that the big house was evenly heated , though many of the neighbors had to depend on the warmth from oilstoves . Angie grumbled often over the food restrictions , but still managed to prepare uniformly delicious meals . The service flags , and later the gold-star flags which roused Hugh Kent to savage profanity , embellished the windows up and down the street ,  | but Seneth 's displayed only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Bell invested in Liberty Bonds for her . She gave her older children money to take to school for vague and patriotic purposes , and Kit saved tinfoil with such whole-souled devotion that he found himself unable to relinquish his accumulation when his Sunday School class collected the balls . David Knight continued to come for dinner , to take Seneth to Saturday afternoon concerts , to send her flowers , to ask her to marry him . He failed to persuade her to dine with him or to attend the theater , but her excuse that she was in mourning did not deceive him . She would not play bridge of an evening at Brosia 's house , though . she sometimes asked Brosia and Hugh to make up one table in her own living room . Seneth played an atrocious game , she interrupted herself to ask Hugh 's advice about the children , or to send them to bed , or to go up and see if they were in bed . Watching her , Knight decided the maternal urge could never be regulated to meet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their offspring or too much . He enjoyed the children for their own sakes and found it not difficult to be friends with them . A lack of selfconsciousness and patronage on his part smoothed his way as did a simple and natural tenderness he never concealed . His wife had not wanted children , he had believed until after her death , when her physician ? a woman and a relative by marriage ? had revealed that she was sterile and had known it for some years . A fair and Christmas party at the church , scheduled for an early December afternoon , offered him an opportunity for a talk with Seneth alone . Brosia had a Red Cross booth ,  | she could keep an eye on the four young Clevelands , whom Knight had promised to drive to the parish house in his car . Let the children have a hilarious afternoon , an early supper with their Sunday School friends , and then he and Seneth would call for them before their bedtime and bring them home . This plan permitted him to have Seneth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her calm acceptance . Not that the youngsters were n't superb , he thought , noting their exquisitely clear skins , the sturdy bodies , the lovely , eager absorption in living which glowed in their serious eyes . Rhodes , twelve , and Mary , two years younger , had Seneth 's coloring , but Lettice and Christopher were fair . Like their father , Knight remembered someone had told him . All the way to the bazaar the children argued violently as to whether the Sunday School would have a Christmas tree and presents this year . The rector had urged that the customary celebration be lapsed , the money be given to war work . Kit , whose small world harbored only intense convictions and no doubts , insisted that only piggies would vote for a tree when the soldiers ' little children did n't have enough to eat . But Rhodes asserted that he had served notice on his teacher that his future attendance as a member of her class depended on the announcement of a large tree with candy for everyone . " I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till December and then spring the idea . " Rhodes 's dark level eyebrows , so like his mother 's , met in a straight line when he frowned . " Dr. Rodd should have told us in August that there would n't be any tree . Then the kids who did n't approve could have stayed away from Sunday School . This way they get you for a whole year and then let you down . "  | When Knight returned to the house , after depositing the youngsters at the door of the parish hall , he found Seneth in the upstairs living room , sewing covering her lap . A new dress for Mary , she explained , smiling indulgently as his awkward hands plucked at the flowered silk . " I make every stitch of clothing for my two girls by hand , " Seneth said . The light was had , he warned her , winter days were short . He stood beside her , staring down at the silk . " Cold weather depresses inc . I like the long , sunny days when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I hate summer evenings . " Seneth pinned a breadth capably to her knee . " As soon as the days begin to grow short , then I 'm happy . I never feel secure except on winter nights , when I can pull down the shades , turn on the lights , and feel that those I love are sheltered , safe , and warm . I love to close the world out . In summer the children fight against coming in , even to me . " He murmured , " Even to you , " and suddenly leaned over to kiss her gently , repeatedly , on her cheek . She needed him , he told her , also gently , to have when the children did n't come in at all . Seneth took a stitch , but the silk thread knotted , broke . " I can not , David . " She tried to rethread the needle , feeling his kisses , a tender , steady rain undermining her resolute will . They must decide , Knight announced , for he was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acres he farmed required his attention . But if Seneth could n't see her way clear to marrying him , he intended to relinquish his holdings to accept the commission the Army offered  | him . " Not because life will be without value , but because men without responsibilities are needed now . " Her roughened forefinger caught against the surface of the silk and Seneth winced , for the flesh had been pricked raw . Tucking made her nervous , it had to be so mathematically exact . She watched David 's short , compact figure cross the room , noting that his abundant brown hair had been cut too short , that the barber had skirted the cowlick . He lifted one of the clumsy , overstuffed chairs and brought it over , planting it in front of her so that their knees touched when he sat down . Seneth nodded " Yes " to his cigarettes and he began to smoke in rapid , savage puffs . He smoked too much , just as he drank too much coffee , but if she remonstrated he would only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Not that she would be allowed to , she thought , for she had already once or twice encountered a granite-hard expression in his light blue eyes , and his jaw sometimes set . He 'd boss me and I 'm afraid I 'd love it . When Frank died I said I 'd never go through the torment of adjusting myself to a man the second time , but it might not be hard to , with David . He can be gentle and hard and kind . And , as he says , the children will grow up , perhaps leave me .. . The blue eyes of the man opposite met her startled upward glance . He continued to smoke silently . Oh , my children ! Seneth unpinned her sewing , folded it , a sudden emotion shaking her heart so that her whole body trembled . David might order me around and welcome , but if he interfered with the children . . . Not that he would mean to be severe , but Rhodes has a temper and no one understands Lettice as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " You do n't have to choose between your children and me , Seneth . Do n't let an imaginary conflict torture you , dear . " But I do have to choose . He 'd claim my time and attention for himself . Kit would n't be free to come to my room , I could n't take him into my bed . David would say I spoil Kit . Hugh says so now . Hugh is always telling me the children need a man 's discipline . Those horrible newspaper stories you read of brutal stepfathers and mothers helpless to rescue their children  --  am I to let that happen to mine ? " Seneth Seneth ! " His arms about her , he pulled her to her feet , heedless of the spools that rained upon the floor from her overturned workbasket . " You 've thought enough ? now feel ! " His mouth on hers , her body clasped to his by the pressure of strong arms locked behind her back .. . For the first time in her life Seneth experienced rapture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had been a girl . The knowledge that she had never known herself , body or soul , confused her , but stronger than confusion was a glory as if she had been caught up into the center of the sun . She clung blindly to David and heard a thunder in his chest which could only be the beating of his heart . When she struggled , his arms instantly loosened ; not releasing her , but as if his gentleness would not let him hold her against her will . We could be so happy , so happy , she told herself , while something far back in the depths of her mind clamored to be examined . She had thought her life settled , romance over , and now it seemed to her that it had just begun . It must be wrong , because it is new and strange and I am not young . What did I feel for Frank ?  | " You do love me . " The man 's quiet , assured voice denied the tremor of his body , a current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . Seneth turned from the smiling glow in his excited eyes , rested her cheek against the fuzzy cheviot surface of his coat sleeve . The mantel clock struck the half-hour , a single lingering note that always seemed to her to epitomize regret . Her gaze followed a seam in the carpet and there , tangled in the slim Queen Anne legs of her sewing chair , lay heaped the gay flowered silk that she had dropped ? how long ago ? The vague warning hovering in her consciousness instantly translated itself into words as vividly as if a banner had been unfurled for her to read : My happiness does not come first ! The shocked realization that she had forgotten her children rolled like a ball of lead across her stomach so that she fancied her muscles crushed to a sickening pulp . The nausea was followed by an icy chill . I forgot the children ! For the first time since they were born ! She loathed herself with a scorching fury that boiled up ugly epithets from the black pools that she now discovered lurked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Bitch ! She would have denied she knew the words . Panic-stricken , she broke away from David Knight 's arms , horrified at him , ready to believe him a sorcerer who had held her under an evil spell . Her unreasoning terror like a roaring wind filled her ears , drowning out the appeals of her lover , driving her , a distracted creature , to her desk with perhaps some faint idea that it offered a barricade . I forgot the children ! If happiness does that to me , I must put it aside . They are my responsibility , they are entitled to all my love . Life is  | for them , not for me . Seneth 's hand fumbled with her papers , she neither saw nor heard distinctly , but when Knight came close to her she cried out . Her beautiful voice , hard and strained , said , with a deadly intentness as cruel and as mechanical as machine-gun fire : " Do n't touch me ! I will have nothing to do with you . I never want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her heart began to ache . She had slept badly , but a merciful numbness , partly exhaustion , had helped to stiller the shell of self-control . Now , as she knelt at the end of the pew she and her children occupied with Brosia , Seneth felt desolation , gray , inexorable , close over her . The service flag at one side of the altar reminded her that David would soon be overseas . She dreaded to hear the organ , tried frantically to pray . But I did right , I know I did right . God , you know I did right , I did the only thing I could do . She stifled a gasp as the magnificent chords throbbed through the church and through her heart . The choir be-gan : " God save our splendid men , Send them safe home again ? " The sharp weight of pent-up tears stabbed at her burning eyes , tore at her dry throat . Seneth wept , hiding her face in her hands . As she cried , the conviction swept over her that her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor . For one long moment she did not care .  | THE END of the war meant that Brosia and Gillian no longer saw each other twice a week at the surgical dressings meetings , that Seneth no longer needed to apologize for having no time to knit . Gillian had mildly enjoyed the war , though she failed to perceive how much the general excitement had brightened her days . She had been in charge of detail at her office , she had packed gift bags after office hours for strange , pathetic men she would never have to see , she had listened to stories of spies and alarms whispered by noncombatants to enliven their routine . After the Armistice , Cousin Leidy complained that the newspapers printed nothing but trash and Gillian agreed with her that they had been wise not to buy a new , large flag . Brosia , who had persuaded her husband to specialize in nose , ear and throat , thus relieving himself of the long hours demanded by a general practice , tried , without success , to persuade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gillian to move , to shorten her skirts , to bob her hair . " You always are neat , dear . But if you bob your hair you 'll look ten years younger . All the women are doing it . " Her long , heavy hair had been Gillian 's one distinction from childhood . Her family and friends , pressed to describe her , always mentioned her hair . Its color was drab , a pale cinnamon , and Gillian indignantly vetoed any suggestion  | of a brightening rinse . She had never been able to wave it satisfactorily at home , but she distrusted the methods of the beauty shops . The great mass of it , unbound , fell below her knees ; braided , the rope was half as thick as her arm . When she shampooed it at home it required an entire day ? Sunday  --  to get it dry . There was nothing to do with it except to bundle it into a huge knot on top of her head , where it continually slipped and must be constantly reanchored . Milliners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , frequently recommended that Gillian have it " thinned out . " But her hair , she felt , distinguished her . Shorn of it , even of a single strand , something of the precious individuality without which she could not face life might be lost to her . Brosia had had her own bronze mop bobbed against her husband 's expressed wishes , and secretly hoped that he might make an issue of her willfulness . To her exasperation and mortification , I high failed to notice the change for three or four days . Then he said it looked pretty , but that he preferred long hair . To be smart and to look young demanded little of Brosia at thirty-six beyond some attention to her diet and a natural talent for convention and style . Her pretty face and figure permitted her to wear every color and fashion , her legs , she thankfully admitted , did not make a travesty of the rising skirts . The thickness of her hands never slimmed , but manicures and massages whitened and softened them . She had a passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever possible she bought handmade garments ? underclothing , blouses , collars and cuffs . But she would wear these lovely things too long , secretly planning  | to save on French laundry bills . Sometimes the tiny tucks and pleats and fairy buttonholes collected so much grime that the rubbing necessary to get them clean wore through the delicate threads . It was a fad of Brosia 's to have different stationery for the four seasons of the year . In the spring she used a pale green paper , stamped with her die in silver ; in summer a delicate blue , monogrammed in gold ; for fall , tan and red , and in winter gray , embossed in violet . She liked to spend hours at the stationer 's selecting the colors , inspecting their designs for new dies . Her fondness for detail extended to her bridge parties ; her linens , prizes , tallies , and refreshments all matched harmoniously , the product of hours of her time . Hugh , passing the doorway of the living room when she entertained her club , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear her slow , cultivated tone as she made a bid . She never grew excited , her face never flushed , she always managed to keep her voice low . At such times Hugh thought , she reminds me of artificial flowers , perfect in form and a damn good imitation of the real thing . Hugh Kent , his wife 's friends said , had been lifted out of the gutter by her . In his case the gutter had been a small town where he had clerked in the grocery store patronized largely by- summer residents . Brosia , an orphan with a cash inheritance and driven by ambition , had recognized in the young , rather silent man behind the counter material adaptable to her plans . The favorite of the aunt , ? her mother 's sister who had brought up the three Fields girls , ? Brosia had been left most of Aunt Jane 's money and all her collection of half-truths . It was because she had been taught that her delicate mother 's unhappy married life had been due to  | an unsuitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a professional man . A long line of lawyers , doctors and college presidents ran Aunt Jane 's family fable , had built up a tradition which Brosia 's mother  --  by marrying a businessman  --  had broken , to her bitter regret . When Brosia discovered that Hugh Kent had taken a premedical course , that lack of funds had cut short his plan to be a doctor , she decided to marry him . She had financed his medical studies and internship , had paid most of the cash invested in the practice bought from a physician ready to retire . With her aversion to ugly or sordid scenes , Brosia managed the manipulation of her purse strings with considerable skill . She was never blatant or crude . If she expected gratitude , she certainly avoided the use of that word . The success of her husband apparently engrossed her , she cultivated mutual friends for his sake , arranged beefsteak dinners at which he entertained the members of his medical society , stag . She could not be sure what Hugh thought of her activities , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her suspicions that , left to himself , no man would ever get ahead . This realization enabled her to be courteously persistent and firm about their frequent week-end visits to Mrs. Tracy ? their only , as Brosia reminded Hugh , really wealthy friend . Mrs. Tracy , a childless widow past sixty , possessed sufficient income to provide her with servants who ran her home as efficiently as a hotel . She had always had money , and Brosia , shrewdly studying her , recognized a subtle difference in her attitude toward its use that the younger woman envied and strove to attain . If she could once master the problem of when to be easily indifferent and when to  | be righteously indignant , Brosia assumed confidently that the future would be in her grasp . Hugh labeled Mrs. Tracy tiresome and a bore . " She 's a tightwad , too . Why , do you know , she had me drive her down the line so she could phone from the drugstore at local rates ? Just because the toll charges would have been more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mrs. Tracy did lovely things for them , Brosia insisted . The widow had a great many friends who consulted her for advice . " The kind of people who make good patients . What I mean is , they ask her to recommend a specialist and she always sends them to you . You ca n't minimize the value of that sort of thing , can you , dear ? The only possible return for us to make is to go to her when she asks us . In spite of her money she is very lonely . And I think a little afraid of being liked only because she is rich . She trusts us . " If Hugh barked , as he sometimes did , " I wo n't be asked for medical advice at her dinner table , " that only served to accent the contrast between his irascibility and the unfailing gentleness of his patient wife . " But I feel we ought to do something for Gillian . " Brosia , the third summer after the war , planned a motor trip . Hugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She glanced absently at him , stretched on the reed lounge in the sun parlor which she had had done in chintz this spring . The patches of white hair above either temple intensified the gray of Hugh 's eyes and his heavy black eyebrows . That familiar zigzag outlined itself sharply as he found something to interest him in his paper . Brosia murmured  | hopefully , " Do n't you feel we ought to do something for Gillian , dear ? " " Why ? " He 's reading those ghastly farm advertisements , Brosia thought . She glanced around the attractive room , draperies , ivy , cushions , and rugs , exactly right . I have a flair for color , I may take up interior decoration some day . She remembered how difficult it had been to measure , cut , and sew the glass curtains , and that she had had to hang them herself . Hugh takes so little interest in the house , yet he 's always complaining that he does n't get enough exercise . Even with Etta to help me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I keep my figure . The glass set in the wall panel gave Brosia an attractive view of a young-looking , well-groomed woman , slim in a green tailored morning frock . A little too standardized , perhaps , like the cleverly planned room , but graceful certainly and serene . " Here 's a bargain . " Hugh began to read aloud . So many acres under cultivation , so many acres woodland , a description of house and barns , the number of cattle , the amount of cordwood cut . Brosia said smoothly , " We ca n't live on a farm . Hugh , do n't you think we ought to do something for Gillian ? " He had already asked why , Hugh mumbled , twisting wildly in an effort to get at his pocketknife . " Well , she does n't get much out of life . I thought we could take her with us as far as Seneth 's and stop there overnight . Then we 'd drive her to Oceanside , where Gillian always spends her vacations . It will be a change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Brosia , staring at her feet in the glass , turned one foot to obliterate an awkward line .  | " I think we ought to do something for Gillian , do n't you ? " Hugh grunted , opened his knife with his teeth . " Is that why you want to take Gil ? Because you feel you ought to ? " He began to cut out his advertisement . She wanted to get her sister away from those limp Youngs , Brosia averred , leaning forward to disentangle an ivy spray which had started to climb the wrong trellis wire . Firmly , kindly , Brosia twined the tendrils around the support she had planned to have it follow . Heavens , these vines were obstinate ! " You said yourself that Gillian is very nervous lately . I think Granny Jameson is driving her to the verge of a nervous breakdown . " His guess was that it was the stock market , not Granny , that caused Gillian to lose weight , Hugh argued . The majority of his women patients had the stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neurological ward . " Get Gil away from her broker 's office and you 'll be doing her a service . But she wo n't leave . " Nor would she . When Brosia telephoned her , Gillian explained that she had already promised Cousin Leidy to stay at home with Granny Jameson while Leidy and Cousin Waldo went away to some quiet place to rest . Cousin Waldo was in a bad way , he had gone all to pieces , the doctor had told them he had a terrible case of nerves . " I wanted him to see Hugh , but ? well , you know Cousin Waldo does n't feel that Hugh is very sympathetic . And when you 're sick you have to have confidence in your doctor , or you might as well not take his medicine . " " But Gil , you need a vacation yourself , do n't you ? I thought it would be lovely for you and Seneth and me to be together again , as when we were girls . And you have n't  | seen the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew , but she wanted to be able to report back to her husband that she had pleaded . She and Hugh decided that Gillian must be financing Cousin Waldo 's nervous breakdown , and Hugh threatened to visit the house and beat some sense into Gillian 's fool head . He was about fed up on this goddamn theme of sacrifice , Hugh stormed , hanging a spoon down on the metal drainboard of the sink . He and Brosia were in the kitchen , foraging the Sunday night snack . " Hell , I suppose I have a duty to her , in a way . She 'd he a bright woman , if the kinks in her brain could he straightened out . Suppose I bust a baseball bat over her skull , will her hair nullify the shock ? " It did not surprise Seneth to learn that Gillian had refused to break away . Seneth with her children came out to the car to welcome her sister and brother-in-law , and Seneth announced that she no longer invited Gillian to visit her every summer , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " After all , we can only do what we believe to be right . If we make mistakes , we have to pay for them . No one else will . " Good God , thought Hugh  --  which , he realized , was precisely what he always thought when he considered Seneth . The gray had multiplied in her hair this summer ; her skin , as usual , blotched in the heat . But her voice still charmed ; she laughed tenderly , as if to her the mistaken adult remained a child . The house , which she had purchased a year after her husband 's death , satisfied some longing in Hugh . He stood looking up at it after Seneth and Brosia had gone inside  | and while the children quarreled amiably over the privilege of carrying the suitcases from the car . The two-story brick farmhouse faced the drive which had been cut through when the State road sheared away the meadow at its gable end , leaving a bluff . From the drive one saw a row of windows like plaid patches in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ivory , too . When Hugh drove to the barn , which served as garage , the curve brought him around to the back of the house , where the land fell away from a stone-paved terrace to form a gorgeous wide green bowl , all green pasture and twisted apple trees . None of the thirty acres had been farmed for years , but Seneth kept the grass trimmed , the trees pruned so that from the terrace the effect was something of a cultivated pattern like , Hugh had once said , the design for a china plate . The barns and outbuildings , empty , clean , were tinder-dry . The place could be made to pay , Hugh liked to inform Brosia , with a little study and care . Would she like to be the wife of a country doctor who farmed on the side ? To which Brosia usually responded that the nearest town already had two doctors starving to death . As soon as he had put up the car , Hugh set off with the clamorous children to get the milk . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either side of Hugh . The youngsters customarily left Brosia to their mother and regarded Hugh as their own guest . Fourteen-year-old Mary looked as he thought Brosia might have looked at that age . Only her eyes were too dark . " Why do n't you keep a cow ? " Hugh perversely asked this question each time he visited them . Seneth , he knew , would n't allow an animal on the place , nor would she  | plant as much as a bean . She insisted she made friends of her neighbors by buying milk and vegetables and eggs . If they had livestock , they 'd be compelled to hire a man to stay on the place ( luring the winter and look after things , Rhodes pointed out . " Mother does n't like animals , but she would n't stand for having them neglected . " The tension in the tall , thin boy 's clever face eased a little when he smiled . Lettice wanted pussy cats , Mary had been offered a collie pup . A perfectly adorable dog , she declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other side of Hugh , muttered . She had a habit of speaking without moving her lips , an accomplishment of which she was extremely proud . The drawback was that no one could tell what she was trying to say . She was thin , like Rhodes , but fair , with a sharp nose and greenish blue eyes . Hugh asked her what she had said . " I know . " Kit , swinging the milk pail , hit himself a smart crack on his tanned , hare shins . " She says Mother wo n't let us have pets , because we might get foolish about them . Mother does n't want us to like animals . She says it 's more important to have friends . " Rhodes , whose voice never hurried , remarked temperately , " Mother lies . " For a moment he refused to meet Hugh 's glance , then capitulated . " Well , I mean she kids herself . " " You shut up ! " Kit , who had run ahead to lower the pasture bars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and anger . " Do n't you dare say things about my mother ! " But it was eight-year-old Kit who had cried half the night  | when forced to return a litter of rabbits a neighbor had given him , Lettice whispered to Hugh . He overheard Lettice and Mary arguing about truthfulness on the home walk , while he and Rhodes carried the filled pail . All mothers lied to their children , Lettice insisted , nearly everyone lied . " It saves a lot of time and fuss . You tell fibs yourself , Mary . " " Well , do n't you ? " Mary stopped to pull a head of red sweet clover which she chewed like gum . She never lied , Lettice asserted proudly . No matter what the row , she came out with the truth . " No one with real guts lies . I do n't . Rhodes does n't . We both have guts . " The guest room at the front of the house faced the west . As Hugh and Brosia freshened up for dinner , the curving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath the sunset orange and red of an omelet-puffed sky . The clouds frothed and foamed , scarlet streaks shot through the mass , as if flames leaped up from hidden coals . Hugh would never be ready for dinner , if he did n't come away from that window , Brosia warned . She sat at the dimity-draped vanity table . " The country looks so lonely when the sun goes down . It depresses me , but Seneth loves it . She 's happy , you know , when she can shut the blinds or pull down shades . " She and Seneth had had such a nice talk , Brosia revealed , bringing the soft waves of her hair into line about her face . " Hugh dear , are you listening ? I think Seneth is the happiest woman I know . Well , the happiest next to me . You did n't think I meant I was unhappy , did you , dear ? I could n't bear to have you feel that I do n't appreciate all I have . I 'd be an ungrateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life is . It 's only that I forgot myself when I thought of Seneth . I compared her to other women I know , not to myself . " Placating God again , and it might be pathetic if He listened to her , Hugh thought . If I say anything it will be brutal , so I 'll keep still . " You 're hungry . " Brosia forgave him . What she had intended to tell him , she murmured , was that Seneth might spend the winter on the farm . The only problem was the question of schools . " Seneth says she and the children have grown so close this summer that she dreads to go back to the city where they 'll have so many interests outside their home . She says the children fill her life completely and she asks no greater happiness than to be always necessary to them . " Hugh turned to the window . The fire in the sky was out . A mist like steam was rising from the outlines of the black hills . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever occurs to your sister that her children are unhappy ? " " After all Seneth 's done for them ? Oh , of course , they may be restless , but that 's because they 're young . Or perhaps they like to feel blue . It 's dramatic at a certain age . " She could remember as a girl enjoying the feeling that she was unappreciated , Brosia testified . The gong rang . Someone , Kit probably , ran shouting past the bedroom door . " Dinner 's ready . " Brosia stood up . Her frock had long , tight sleeves which did nothing for her large , thick hands . " Who told you the children are not happy , Hugh ? Surely they have n't complained to you ? " He could see for himself , Hugh evaded . Anyone could  | see . No kids wanted a mother to sacrifice herself to them . " What 's her price , they 'll begin to ask as soon as they 're old enough . If they 're not willing to meet it , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitcase , set it tidily out of the way . He says these shocking things to tease me . He does believe in sacrifice and in love ? he must . Why , sacrifice is the foundation of marriage and motherhood . I never talk about what I 've done for Hugh , but deep down in his heart he knows . Ever since we married I 've put him first . It 's the same with Seneth and her children . Perhaps a man is naturally more selfish and he 's ashamed to admit it . My poor boy hardly ever will admit he 's wrong . Now I 'm always ready to confess a fault and apologize . I think Hugh would be happier if he was n't so continually on the defensive . He needs psychology ? perhaps I can persuade him to attend some of those wonderful lectures that Frenchwoman is giving this winter at the Club . She knew the subject should be dropped , but words crowded on her tongue . As Hugh followed her into the hall , she touched his sleeve . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage in which sacrifice had no part . " " Well , I believe it 's indecent and immoral for a woman to make a burnt offering of herself in any human relationship . " Hugh stopped at the head of the stairs . He flung back his head as if a weight oppressed his lungs . " What 's more , these burnt offerings are usually the ones most severely burned in the end , and then do they turn venomous ! Maybe we 'd better pay some attention to Angie 's biscuits . " After dinner , which , Angie had informed Seneth , it seemed really worth while to cook since a man to appreciate  | it was present , Hugh suggested the terrace instead of threehanded bridge . He liked to lie on the grass and the four children imitated his example , but Seneth and Brosia settled themselves in wicker chairs . The purple darkness formed a screen on three sides , sturdy outlines of the house blocked in a fourth . Overhead the sky , sparsely decorated with stars , looked as flat and symmetrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the flash of fireflies lighted up the short length of the grass stems . The fragrance of old shrubs and flowering hushes , growing in shaggy masses , deepened and faded in perfumed gusts . On the terrace the seven people became shadows , perceptible only when they moved , to he identified only when they spoke . " I know exactly what I 'm going to be . " Mary 's undertone , intended for Hugh , was unfortunately timed . Her mother and aunt 's rapid chatter , becalmed , left both listening . Mary , exasperated , stared angrily at the stars . " I 'm going to be an actress . " It made her feel tall to stretch her long legs as she lay flat on her back , her hands locked to form a pillow for her head . Lettice had a high , thin voice to match her thin body which could n't relax , even when at rest . She had to untwist her arms and legs before she could sit up . " I 'd rather make money . Actresses are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they go into the movies . I 'll have a job like Aunt Gil , but I 'll get married , too . " " The restless age . " Seneth moved her chair a little , to avoid a beam of light from the hall lamp . It shone through the screen door , laying a silver finger on her breast and on her favorite amulet of tiny baby teeth . Kit delivered himself of the opinion that no one would  | ever marry Lettice , and Rhodes , lounging next to Hugh , rolled over to face the turf . " Miss Hoben is willing to coach me . She thinks perhaps she can fix it so I can work my way through a dramatic school . Do reception work , or something . " Mary sighed . " Gee , think of being on the stage ! " Seneth 's wedding ring glistened as she leaned forward . The light behind her softened the lines of her face and figure to the gracious indistinctness of a portrait in oil . Her white scarf was as misty as moonlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Miss Hoben 's , Mary . She is not a good friend for you . For one thing , she 's years older . " " So are you . " " Do n't be rude , dear . Miss Hoben 's influence has already left its mark . " Lettice kicked excitedly , her heel landing on Hugh 's built-up shoe . " Oh , excuse me , Uncle Doctor . But , Mother , I think Mary has a right to study dramatics . If you wo n't help her , why ca n't Miss Hoben ? " " You have n't finished school yet , Mary . " The pale gray blur that was Brosia , moved . " I think your mother feels you 're too young to think of the stage yet a while . " Rhodes said , " Mother feels we 're all too young to think . " Not the sweetest story ever told , but told damn often , Hugh mused , uneasily conscious of the tension in the four young bodies motionless on the grass . There 'll be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it , but what ? Then he discovered that his pipe was out and Lettice sprawled across his legs , and fora moment he preferred a collie dog to any kid on earth . " What you do n't seem to realize , Mother , is that we have  | to make something of our lives . " Lettice awkwardly gained her feet . " I simply wo n't stay here next winter and go to a country school . I 've got to study shorthand , so I can fit myself for an office job . " Their guests could n't possibly be interested in the discussion already too prolonged , Seneth asserted firmly . Lettice and Kit should be in bed , Mary and Rhodes might play one hand of bridge with Aunt Brosia and Uncle Doctor , if they liked . " I promised Kit to go up with him tonight , but I wo n't stay . Be sure your hands are clean , children , before you touch the cards . " Young Rhodes is sixteen , Hugh remembered . You 'd think even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lurched toward Seneth . " I 'll always stay with you , Mother . Forever and ever . " He clasped her about the knees , rubbing his face into her skirts . " Why do n't you go to sleep , Hugh ? " Brosia raised herself on one elbow in bed , leaned over him . Moonlight suffused the guest room with a silver brilliance like pewter , melted . " How do you know I have n't been asleep ? " " I 've been awake myself , listening for your breathing to change . You 're thinking about something and I want you to stop it , dear . I tell you , I can hear those wheels spinning in your head , working some problem out . You must stop it , Hugh Renfrew Kent  --  do you hear ? Any man ought to be tired enough to sleep , after the driving you did today . " She kissed him , lay down again beside him . If one flesh , why not one mind , is there any reason why a husband should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | inspection ? Hugh turned his head so that he faced the window , but the moon rode too high to be seen . I 'm worried about the kids , they 're up against it . A stepfather might have saved them , but Seneth gave Knight the air . Wonder if she ever thinks of him ? Hell , that blanket on my foot weighs a ton . Who wants a blanket in August ? " Hugh ? " He groaned . " Hugh , " Brosia said , " I 've something to ask of you . Do n't encourage the children to be rebellious . I do n't know that you do , but if they try to force you to take sides , you must uphold Seneth . She said at first that the summer had been perfect , but you can see how she hates to admit anything else . She whispered to me , as we came up to bed tonight , that some things almost break her heart . I told her it 's just a phase ? all children get silly notions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she says , she thinks she 'd have a nervous breakdown . " " Kit will have something worse than a nervous breakdown some day . " That was a sample of what she meant , Brosia declared , speaking slowly as if to emphasize her self-control . They were really outsiders , she and Hugh , the responsibility for her children was vested in Seneth . " She has to do as she thinks best . But a word from you to the children will do a world of good , Hugh . They adore you . Seneth says they 're sound at heart , but they 've reached the stage where they 're more willing to take anyone 's advice than hers . " " Seneth wo n't take my advice . " He 's sleepy , thought Brosia , he has n't heard what I 've been saying . But Hugh woke her , after she had dozed , by  | kicking the blanket folded at the foot of the bed , to the floor . In the morning Angie tapped on the door to ask Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missus . " She 's sick in bed . Never closed her eyes all night . Will you have graham or corn muffins for breakfast ? " Brosia replied that she never ate hot breads , but that the doctor would he delighted to have corn muffins with maple sugar . Then she hurriedly finished her dressing , a little piqued by Hugh 's failure to respond sympathetically when she diagnosed Seneth 's illness as nerves . " That and the heat . Seneth just keeps going until she 's flat on her back . You 'll have to prescribe for her , Hugh . " He promised to see his sister-in-law after breakfast if she summoned him , and went downstairs ahead of Brosia . The air in the lower rooms was fresh and cool , yet touched with a faint over-glaze as if the sun had already begun to scorch the edges of the midsummer day . Doors and windows open revealed a brilliant green world spread outside the screens . " Is Mother sick ? " Lettice , who was on the porch , swung upon him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , her inquisitive nose , the expression of her small , greenish-blue eyes , combined to produce an effect of a sharp , pointed stick . Angie had told her , Lettice stated , that she was not to bother her mother , that she and the other children were to keep out of the big bedroom . What it probably was , Lettice explained confidently , was a bilious attack . " Mother will eat chocolate cake , and chocolate kills her . " But at the breakfast table , where Brosia occupied Seneth 's chair and poured the coffee , Kit announced that he had  | been in to see his mother . " She cried on me . I guess she cried all night . That 's because Mary and Lettice make her feel so bad . " " She always cries . " Mary , seated next to Hugh at the round table , spoke defensively . " That 's nothing . I cry easy , too . " Brosia murmured . No one was to worry , she had promised their mother not to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give poor Mother something to cure her dreadful headache . Of course the children would try to be as still as mice , when they were in the house . No slamming of doors , no loud talking , no running up and down the stairs . Brosia placed her knife and fork noiselessly on her plate , moved her coffee cup with studied precision , as if even such small sounds might penetrate to the sick woman 's room . If there was anything she could do for the children , Brosia added , she would be only too glad to attempt it . " I can mend runs for you , Mary ? bring me your stockings today . And any other odd jobs of sewing you 'd like to have out of the way . I 'll have to sit with your mother part of the day and we must keep the room dark ; but there may be light enough for me to finish the bureau scarf I 'm making for you , Rhodes . I want you to have it before I go . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she expected them to conform to her unhurried , courteous rule . She ate very slowly , she insisted on a certain formality of service , even if it spread out into delay . Angie must bring in small portions to insure hot food , Kit must exchange his mussed napkin for a fresh one . Brosia 's conversation , deliberate , cheerful , painstakingly adapted to the individual she addressed , was tinged with the same artificiality  | that flawed her obvious efforts to merge her personality with that of the group . She had a definite picture in mind , titled vaguely perhaps , " Family at Breakfast . " The scene , as achieved by her , lacked warmth ; the proportions were correct , but the arrangement remained stiff , the colors cold . The meal finally over , Hugh discovered that Seneth had refused a tray . A cup of clear hot tea was all that she would have brought to her . He found her propped up in bed in her darkened room , her hands hot and dry . Her head throbbed , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioned the tower of pillows at her back . " I 'm so ashamed to be ill , the little time you and Brosia are here . " She looked haggard , even in the dim light , her hastily pinned-up hair dropped limp and straight . Hugh , sitting beside the low , wide bed , his fingers on her jumping pulse , decided that God must pity the women he had made . He gives them a strong animal instinct to protect their young , so their babies will live , but apparently He never equips them with an automatic shutoff . Other animals break clean with their offspring , only humans go mad at the suggestion of a separation . The woman whose heartbeats he counted was a little mad . It 's only the beginning of her struggle , the worst is all before her . Hugh studied the closed eyes , the firmly modeled lips . A good face , but good women had created most of the hells on earth . In between the bowed shutters and the window screen a bumblebee hummed angrily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the children , Hugh mused ; must they beat themselves to death in the struggle to get free ? The wings of the bee tore against the wire screen . A faint , grassscented  | breeze stirred the thin muslin curtains at two of the four windows and a shaft of sunlight , barred evenly , pierced through the window nearest the bed . Hugh put Seneth 's hand gently aside . She opened her eyes . " You steady me , Hugh . I must have something to stop the rocking in me . " The mother of four children , she whispered , could n't afford to be laid up . " I 'll be all right , if you 'll give me a dose to make me sleep . " He stood looking down at her . " Are the children all right , Hugh ? Rhodes must not leave the place today . The reapers are working on the next farm and he does n't know how to keep away from machinery . " Hugh counted four white diamonds on the blue wall paper . Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sixteen , my dear . " Well , one of her friends had a sixteen-year-old son who had lost his leg in a motorcycle accident , Seneth frowned . Boys that age thought they knew everything about a machine , you could n't warn them of danger . " It 's my duty to protect my children , is n't it ? " " To teach them to protect themselves , yes . " She put up her hands to her temples , her face flushed . " I can not endure this pain , " she said . He had bromide in his bag , administered the dose . Seneth would have no one sit with her , she grew drowsy more quickly alone . She knows what she 's doing , Hugh fumed as he rinsed the glass at the bathroom tap . The reason our laws are failures is that we ca n't punish the psychological crimes . Seneth does n't beat her children 's bodies , she only breaks their spirits . She does n't chain them in the cellar , she  | merely chains their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let that bumblebee out . Seneth believes she can keep her children safe by pulling off their wings . She  --  Hugh turned as he heard a step in the hall . " Hello , Rhodes . " " How 's Mother ? " His patient needed sleep , Hugh said . " We 'll keep the house quiet today and by tomorrow she 'll be herself again . " Rhodes muttered something that sounded like " Stalling , " but he followed the doctor clown the stairs and out on the terrace where Brosia sat , mending overflowing her lap . She had found a tablecloth to darn , she announced competently ; the two girls and Kit had started down the lane to fetch the mail . " I 'm afraid I have the most comfortable chair , I do n't want you to think I 'm selfish , but I ca n't sew unless my chair is the right height . " Brosia stuck her needle in the linen , gathered the mass up in her arms . " I 've taken the only spot of shade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this sun . Let me make room for you , I do n't need the entire terrace . " Her motions were as deliberate as her voice , her calmness reminded her husband of a white summer cloud . The clouds glided smoothly but surely on . He intended to locate the widest apple tree and lie under it , Hugh declared ; the country would be saved by men who lie flat on their backs under apple trees on an August day . I 'll smoke and Rhodes can get it off his chest , he thought . But when he found his tree , halfway down the curving bowl , and had filled his pipe , he remained in a sitting posture , back braced against the gnarled trunk . " Uncle Doctor ? " Rhodes took out his knife to cut himself a wedge of tree gum .  | " Sir ? " " I told Mary and Lettice to leave home . It 's their only chance . " Hugh said , " Do n't be a young fool . " After all , he reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kids without jobs or money had no wings . " Girls as young as your sisters ca n't start out on their own , Rhodes . They have no training ; they do n't even know what they 're fitted to be . " " They 'll never be trained . " Rhodes chipped off a second bit of gum . " Your mother ? " " I suppose you 're ready to fill me full of a lot of hop . I know exactly how ill my mother is and that is n't ill at all . Are you going to sit there and tell me she has heart trouble and no one must cross her ? " Hugh promised heavily . " I 'll tell you nothing ? except the truth . " But at the end of an hour of argument and explanation , the crosscurrents of confusion and dismay , pity and alarm , indignation and dissension , had pulled him into a thick and muddy stream . The bitterness and injustice of Seneth 's oldest son appalled , he lacked ability to recognize fair restraints , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , even making allowance for his passion and his bias , his revelations sickened his listener , mainly with the premonition of agony to come . The green bowl , patterned in apple trees sifted through with sunlight , filled , it seemed to Hugh , with the echoes of that young , desperate boy-voice . The smell of fruit and of dried grass blended in a fragrance that later must recall the picture of the house chimney barely visible at the top of the curving rim . Blue  | sky , a universe drowsy with peace  --  and private worlds blazing as merrily as hell . " It 's like this , " Rhodes said . " I do n't love my mother . " He does n't know it , but he 's told the truth . Hugh glanced at the lad 's sharp , clear profile . Makes it easier for him , of course , but Cod help Seneth if he ever puts it into words for her . Hugh warned aloud , " You must n't let your mother know . Try not to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no woman on earth deserves to hear that from her son . I do n't care what her failure has been , she does n't merit that . " Miss Hoben 's touring car rolled into the driveway fashionably close to five o'clock that afternoon . Mary introduced the blonde , exquisitely gowned , middle-aged actress rather awkwardly . She had called , Miss Hoben explained , to meet Mary 's mother . " To ask her consent to my coaching this child a little . Mary is growing fond of the stage . " She accepted the information that Seneth was too ill to receive visitors as imperturbably as she endured the concentrated admiration of the four young Clevelands , who appeared to credit her with the possession of a magic charm . The first quarter-hour of her call had to be expended in the service of iced drinks and small cakes . Seneth refused to smuggle liquor into the house , but Angie kept a variety of syrups and fruit juices chilled . Brosia presided at the tea wagon . " You 're sure you like chocolate milkshake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for chocolate at all . It 's no trouble to have Angie mix something else . I 'd be heartbroken if you had a preference and did n't mention it . Or how about hot tea ? Tea with lemon , and I 'll  | ask Angie to heat some scones . No ? Well , then do let the boys move your chair over here by the window . There 's a breeze . Oh , thank you , I 'm very comfortable in this corner ? you 've been driving and must be warm . " Later when the young folk , at the doctor 's suggestion , had reluctantly set off after the milk , ? the only chore on the place , he grumbled , and Seneth ought to be ashamed to look a countryman in the face , ? the actress spoke frankly of what she hoped to be allowed to do for Mary . " She 's simply a stage-struck young girl at present . That phase is transitory , of course , but it presents assets that should be capitalized . Let me work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading and speaking , train her to cross a room gracefully  --  that sort of thing . She is lovely and young , yes ; but gauche . Why , she sits in a chair as if she had a hook for a backbone  --  something , perhaps , on which to hang a birdcage . And when she enters a room I try not to think of Molly , my year-old heifer . " She doubted , Miss Hoben added , that Mary had a gift for acting ; but let that wait . The development of poise , confidence , charm  --  every woman had need of these . " Mary admires me , my walk , my clothes . It is , I think , what do you call it ? a crush ? That will pass , and I feel her mother may approve of what will remain . You will ask her to call on me , will you not ? " She smiled at Hugh , asked him to see her to her car . She stopped beside the imported machine to pull on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , but her face looked tired in spite of her well-cared-for skin . An American , he guessed , but probably thought it dramatic to strive for foreign idioms in her speech . " I ran away from home to go on the stage . " Miss Hoben  | slid in behind the wheel . " It was a mistake . I was no more ready to run away than Mary is now . " She started the engine , waved to him as she rolled past him . He had not looked in on Seneth since morning , for Angie had reported her to be asleep at noon . To his surprise , when the doctor tapped at her door he found his sister-in-law sitting up in bed . The blinds had been opened and the room was light . Seneth , a bandage tied across her forehead , sewed on some soft pink material . " It 's Mary 's dress . She wants it for the Harvest Home Supper , and I promised to finish it in time . " She always kept her promises , Seneth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her word . " When I 'm gone they 'll be able to remember , I hope , that even though they disappointed Mother , she never disappointed them . " Hugh , taking a glass from the night table beside the bed , noted the coiled gold chain of baby teeth . Good God , it 's her rosary . Maybe she says her prayers on it . He remembered something and strolled over to the window , where an exhausted bee crawled feebly on the screen . Nothing to prevent his escape now . He 's as free as air . Only his freedom comes a little too late , for his wings are broken and his strength is gone . Seneth insisted on dressing and coming down to her meals a few days later , though she still moved listlessly and appeared shockingly ill . Hugh , reluctant to leave the household , but unable to linger in the face of Brosia 's apparent eagerness to continue their trip , tormented himself endlessly by his endeavors to fix the boundaries of his responsibility . He suspected that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prompted by Seneth , who resented what she undoubtedly termed his interference . They 're her children , fretted Hugh , but if I see her ruining them , have I no right to rescue them in the name of humanity from the ravages of maternal love ? Unfortunately nothing gives me that right until I can actually prove that it 's time to pick up the pieces . " We wo n't talk about anything painful . " Seneth , left alone with her children , set them a prompt example . She praised Mary 's arrangement of flowers in the living-room vases , commended Lettice for the daily dusting she performed without reminder . Kit , Seneth declared affectionately , waited on her hand and foot . Now that she was better , no one must worry over her , let them make the most of every lovely summer day . " Well , why do we sit and take it ? " Lettice , watching Rhodes wash the car , kicked sullenly at his heap of rags on the grass . She had a long , clever face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mule 's face , Rhodes decided . When she glanced out of the sides of her eyes , she reminded him of a mule putting its ears back , ready to bite . Rhodes scowled at his own reflection mirrored in the hood of the car . " Uncle Doctor says you 've got to be old enough to get and hold a job , before you can talk turkey . I think we could do something pretty soon , if we all stood together . The trouble is , Mary 's soft . We ca n't depend on her . " " I could run away . " " Yes , and you 'd be hauled back . At thirteen you ca n't run all over the country and expect strangers to feed you . No , if you gain any kind of a victory it 's got to be a moral  | one . I thought maybe I 'd talk to Mother about Mary and you . Lettice examined a scratch on her arm . Bruises , dirt and holes , she murmured , just naturally collected on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really think of her . Nobody ever tells their mother what they think of her . It 's being fresh . But mothers can say anything they like . " So could he , insisted Rhodes , polishing the windshield . He had an uneasy feeling , however , that Mary lacked courage to stand by him in a painful scene . She and Kit , Uncle Doctor says , ca n't bear to hurt anyone and that 's going to make life harder for them . Lettice has no feelings at all . He thinks she 's just catty and clever and hard . But honest , he said . " If I have it out with Mother , you and Mary have got to back me up , " Rhodes warned , and Lettice , looking out of the side of her eyes , her head thrown back , nodded . He would suggest a drive to his mother , Rhodes planned , but when he sought her , after changing his clothes , she begged off . She had to work on a dress for Lettice , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you tired , dear ? " Her beautiful voice caressed him . " Not tired ? Then I wish you 'd go up to the attic and see what Kit is doing . He spends hours in that hot place . " Rhodes said , " Mother , I 've got to talk to you . " Suddenly he felt large and clumsy like an iron lamp post , standing beside the cretonne-covered divan on which his mother sat . The oblong , low-ceilinged room certainly lacked air . Pink and blue flowers in the wallpaper design wavered , as if shifting in a haze of heat . But the real flowers , salvia and gladioli , in the old copper kettle in the fireplace before the divan , did not stir . Rhodes glanced desperately at the three  | windows , curtained in dotted Swiss . The tops of the frames met the ceiling , the sills were scarcely wider than a ruler 's width . He had painted them ivory early in the summer and his mother had been annoyed when he spattered one of her gay rag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the man who had come to fit the new covers for the stuffy , oldfashioned furniture , had praised his skill and had advised him to use enamel for the final coat . " Mother , I 've got to talk to you , " said Rhodes . She pushed aside the lemon-yellow fabric that streamed over her lap and rippled to the floor . " Sit down , darling . I want you to feel that you can always talk to me . " " It 's about the girls . " Rhodes to his own astonishment blurted a savage indictment . " They 're perfect babies , the pair of them . " " They 'll grow up , dear . " " That 's the trouble . They wo n't grow up to have any sense . Mary ca n't buy a dress unless you 're along and Lettice is all kinds of an idiot . Dollars and dimes are all one to her . They ca n't either one use their own heads , Mother . " Seneth basted a seam . " I suppose Hugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Thirteen and fourteen is n't a great age , Son . Nor is sixteen . Young people are eager to discard their parents ' experience and advice , but we ca n't let them wreck their lives . I 've always tried to be liberal . And I 've had to be father and mother both to you . Remember that . " She put up a hand to her amulet . Rhodes spread his legs wide apart , brought his feet together with a ruffle of the small throw rug in their grip . Got to drive through . Got to . But I wish my father had left  | us money of our own . His impressions of his father had dimmed so quickly that at times he wondered if he had ever seen him before he lay dead . Funny the things a guy remembers , no sense to them . Whenever I think of the funeral , I sec Aunt Gil jamming her hat on , always jamming her hat on . She never did have a hat that stayed on her hair . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little training with Miss Hoben ? " " I must use my best judgment , Rhodes . Miss Hoben is n't a suitable friend for a young , imaginative girl like our Mary . " " Will you let Lettice take a commercial course ? " Seneth 's ( lark eyes surveyed him coolly , her voice firmed . " I do not like your tone , my son . " We ca n't do a thing . She has it all her own way . Slap your kids , if they answer back . Inexperienced in defeat , a great bitterness took possession of him , setting like a lead weight on his lungs so that he gasped to breathe . As he struggled a hot fire scorched his throat and a band of flame snapped like a whiplash across his eyes . He began to shout , tramping on the rug as if he ground an enemy underfoot . " We 'll clear out , that 's what we 'll do . Take the car and go off on our own . You ca n't stop us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll hide . Suppose we do starve , it 's better to starve than to live with you . Besides , we wo n't starve . I can take care of the girls . You 'll have Kit ? he 's your ideal , a kid afraid of his shadow . " Turning , Rhodes glimpsed Angie , a short , dumpy figure topped by a face that seemed to have only one feature , a wide-open mouth . He continued to shout , because that was the only way to keep his body from bursting into a million fragments like the tree stumps he had seen the farmers  | dynamite into dusty chips . " Even if you are my mother , I think you 're the most selfish woman who ever lived ! " He dashed past her , into the hall , up the stairs to his own room . After he had banged the door and locked it , he remembered that she had said nothing , she had not even turned her head . Angie woke him from a feverish sleep by rattling the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want any dinner . Let me alone . " " You come see your mother . She 's sick . " Angie jerked the knob . The boy rolled off the bed , unlocked the door . " I ca n't help it if she 's sick . Why ? what ? " Behind Angie , the faces of Mary , Lettice and Kit peered , frightened , quiet . " It 's Mother . " Mary shivered . " She 's out of her mind . " Impatient , distrustful , Rhodes followed them down to the living room . The evening sun mellowed the light , but his mother still sat where he had left her . The sewing lay on her lap , but her hands hung idly at her sides . Her dark eyes turned to Rhodes , apparently accepted him . When she spoke her voice terrified her children , it sounded so strangely flat . " Who is making the arrangements for your father 's funeral ? " Seneth said . In the hall Lettice , jerking convulsively from fright , clutched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , is n't she ? To pay us back ? " Rhodes shook his head . " No , she 's not pretending . I 'll get the doctor for her ? quicker to bring him out than to phone . " What is it , he asked himself , watching the speedometer climbing to sixty . Oh , what is it ? Seneth 's attack lasted for two days . The kindly , calm old country doctor referred to it as a lapse . " Your mother has  | had a shock . A telegram , perhaps , or bad news of some kind ? " No bad news , Rhodes answered positively , convinced that he spoke the truth . He listened attentively to the doctor 's instructions ? Mrs. Cleveland must be kept quiet , must be compelled to rest in bed . " Do n't go to her with a hundred questions , either ; let her sleep if she can . A woman with children seldom gets a minute to herself unless she 's too ill to raise her head . " The doctor smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 'll have to wait until she is all right again , " Rhodes argued with Lettice , who had declared there was no reason why they should change their plans . Even Uncle Doctor would expect them to play fair . " If Mother gets worse , I mean to send for him . Well , suppose she is putting on an act ? I ca n't be sure she is and until I am sure , we do the decent thing . " On the second day Seneth 's mind cleared , a symptom that delighted the old doctor . He kept her in bed another day , but the third morning she dressed and came to breakfast , radiantly happy to be " well . " If she noticed any constraint in her children 's manner , she ignored it . They had been forbidden by the doctor to make any reference to her " lapse , " as he persistently designated it , and , still uncertain as to its cause , they worried lest some chance word of theirs bring on a second attack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praised them . " It 's a dull vacation for you , with Mother in bed so much . But she 'll make it up to you . How would you like to go to the beach for two weeks ? " She laughed at their surprise , pushed her coffee cup aside to rest one elbow on the breakfast cloth .  | Her smiling dark eyes , her lovely voice , embraced them . They had forgotten the familiar warmth of her affection , but now they perceived they had missed her love . The little coral-colored cottage they had admired at the tip end of Point Ellen , the day they had picnicked there , would be delightful , Seneth planned . They would need linen and silver , but otherwise the cottage was completely furnished ; she had inquired when they were there . " The rental was so high I decided we could n't afford it , but now it seems important that we all have a breath of sea air . Two weeks will put you in fine trim for school , wo n't it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes and food and the mysterious taxes cost money , demurred . " But can we pay that high rent , Mother ? You said the taxes on the city house and this farm were eating you up . " " The Point Ellen cottage will eat up the new damask chairs I 'd planned to buy for the town house , and perhaps my winter coat as well . " Seneth smiled into the young faces , added clearly , " You wo n't mind a shabby house and a shabby mother , will you , if it means that we all find health and happiness at the shore ? " Kit ran to her , flung his arms around her in a transport of excitement that flushed his berry-brown face . He would learn to dive , he shrieked , hugging her in spasmodic jerks . Mary choked on a bit of toast , eager to discuss the question of new bathing suits . Across the table Rhodes 's eyes met those of Lettice , somber like his own . The plan for running away , the ultimatum he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity for fighting his sisters ' battles , seemed foggy issues now . Inertia , like a sponge on a slate , blurred his mind . Why did n't  | he rise up and oppose this cottage business ? What had happened to his anger , his desire to fight ? What was the matter with him , what had he lost ? He saw , so vividly that it startled him , the creaming green waves of water rippling placidly over a long sandbar , black piling above which gulls wheeled , a shining , sharply-curved stretch of glaring white sand . " Gee , think of a swim every morning before breakfast ! " Rhodes said .  | COUSIN LEIDY and Cousin Waldo sat on the lowest step of the front hall stairs , listening to Gillian , who had consented to telephone Hugh Kent . Through the banister spindles Gillian from her chair at the phone could see the pair , who looked ridiculously like costume dolls . They bobbed their gray heads and waved their hands with the effect of puppets , too . For goodness ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't wobble , or a table with all four legs the same length , I 'd be too surprised to know how to use them , Gillian thought . The chocolate-brown paper added to the darkness of the hall , the gaslight hissed in uneven spurts as if strange , misshapen fingers uncurled and clenched inside the green-and-white globe . Gillian said into the mouthpiece : " Oh ? Hugh . I wo n't keep you but a minute . Could you find time tomorrow to call up the roofing firm ? They charged outrageously for putting on a patch near the chimney , and last night when it rained it soaked the entire wall on that side of the house . . . . Yes , I know , but they 'll listen to a man . " " Tell him the men made more holes , walking on the roof when they patched it . It looked like a scheme to me then . " Cousin Waldo folded his arms , his face stern . At his end of the wire Hugh expostulated , rather wearily , for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why he  | should argue with the roofers , when his sympathies were all with the repairmen . " The house is falling apart and you 've spent enough on it to buy yourself a farm . Why do n't you ask me to phone the real estate agent ? What about that offer he made ? " " Tell him I think Ma 's worse tonight . " Cousin Leidy twisted to glance up the stairway , but no sound came from Granny Jameson 's room . Gillian spoke quickly . " Cousin Leidy thinks Granny is worse , Hugh . Yes , Leidy 's here . Do you want to talk to her ? " She yielded her place at the phone to the older woman , hurried up to her own room . Hugh knew all about that real estate man 's offer . Of course he did . She had explained the details herself . Land values had increased in the neighborhood during the last half-dozen years and a firm of speculators had bought up many properties for apartment house sites . They had suggested a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waldo 's house , but he and his wife had been dismayed at the thought of selling their home . All the associations of their married life centered there , they could never adjust themselves to any other house . " Besides , Ma could n't feel at home in a strange place , " Cousin Leidy had argued . " We have to consider Ma . She 's too old to be uprooted . " If a pair of old fossils elected to die by slow gas asphyxiation in a house where everything from the plumbing to the roof leaked , that was their business , Hugh maintained . Why Gillian should prefer to dwell in the crumbling ruins was her business , too , but it did n't make sense . Perhaps if she refused to pay the house bills , if she demanded decent living accommodations in return for board money , she might  | frighten her cousins into accepting the agent 's excellent cash terms . This suggestion failed , possibly because Gillian had no talent for acting the role of a woman with a purpose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let the cousins shift for themselves ; but stubbornness , commonly substituted for courage in the female character , enabled Gillian to defeat him . In the seven years since the war her salary had doubled , but between her stock investments and the outlay on the house , her bank balance dwindled . But the stocks , she comforted herself , would make her independent in time . Tonight she read the stock reports , frowning , in spite of her glasses , over the lines of fine type , until late . In the next room old Mrs. Jameson died , very peacefully and quite alone . They discovered her in the morning and were shocked , of course , but not grieved . It seemed to Gillian the saddest death she had ever known , because Granny Jameson had outlived love . The burden of her care for years had weighed on Cousin Leidy , crushing out pity and affection , warping all ties . Cousin Leidy could say composedly with dry eyes , " Death is a blessed relief for Ma . We ca n't wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her experience , and she confided to Gillian later that she often dreamed her mother was alive and that she dreaded the dreams . Gillian , turning the hem of a new black dress for Cousin Leidy , revived her memories of her own mother 's death , recalled the funeral of Frank Cleveland , the various services she had attended for relatives of office friends . The heartache and despair she had shrunk from witnessing now seemed to her like flowers for the dead . To be mourned , to leave an  | empty place ? surely no one should be denied the privilege of being briefly missed . The expense of the funeral , which devolved upon her , acquainted her with the appalling charges for even simple arrangements . A lot must be bought , and a marker for the grave . " Most folks leave it to other folks to buy ' em a grave , " the undertaker assured Gillian , who had supposed her cousins owned a family plot . " You 'd think all people expected to be drowned at sea . " Afterward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though old Mrs. Jameson had never been a presence there . Gillian need no longer offer to stay in while Cousin Leidy and Cousin Waldo went to the movies . She had her Saturday afternoons , her Sundays , to herself . Hugh Kent discovered that she often worked through till six or seven o'clock Saturday night and that she sometimes spent her Sunday afternoons in the office , planning Monday 's work . " Now see here ! " I high , older , thinner , so restless that Brosia declared he walked his flesh off in the house , backed Gillian into a corner of the living room after one of Brosia 's slow , well-served dinners and took her to task . " It 's time for a showdown , Gilly . Do n't you ever do anything you want to do ? " " I like my work . It 's what I want to do . " " But do n't you ever want to do anything else ? " Gillian considered . " You mean to help others ? " " Dammit , do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would have liked to shake his sister-in-law , compromised by kicking a petit-point hassock . God did n't lie in wait to smite the man or woman who dared to be happy , Hugh explained . As a matter of fact , he added , it was his  | theory that God condemned much of the effort to help others as a rather sickening example of the filthy reasoning of the human mind . " How many women do you know who try to persuade God to make a bargain with them ? They 'll steep themselves in self-sacrifice , they 'll never permit themselves to be foolish and happy and gay , they always wear hair shirts , and for what ? To save the souls of the unfortunate ? I doubt it . Their real thought is for their own gummy little souls . God is to look after them in exchange for their self-denial . It must keep all the angels working over time to balance the books . " He should not speak recklessly about the Deity , Brosia reproved . " Not every one feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He turned away from Gillian , lighted a cigarette . His sister-in-law pushed the knot of her hair into place , working busily at the long bone hairpins as she walked toward the fireplace . When she reached the fur rug she halted , stared moodily into the bed of shimmering coals . Brosia , seated in a high-backed chair at one side of the grate , murmured that perhaps the room was too warm . She liked it hot , she always felt the cold so , but if Gillian thought there should be more air .. . " What 's this Leidy tells us about reading on Sunday ? " Hugh leaned over the back of the davenport . Gillian was the only woman he knew , he reflected , who selected a dress for best every season and wore it faithfully on every special occasion . Her choice of brown satin this winter was particularly unfortunate ? the material was too stiff and harsh for her figure and skin . She 'd been reading aloud to sick neighbors , the Sunday afternoons she did n't work at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to do , it gave pleasure , and she had thought that perhaps Granny Jameson would have liked her to do it . " Our only real happiness is found in helping others . After all , Hugh , do n't you believe in extending a little kindness as we pass through this world ? " " I 'm inclined to believe that kindness overdone in this world may hurry us into the next . " The angle of his eyebrow rose pointed , sharp . " That goes for giver and receiver in equal parts . " He hesitated , then said without looking at her , " So you 're really happy , Gilly ? " The silence gathered volume , began to rush like a river , a flood between them . Startled , the doctor turned . The dowdy , pathetic figure stood motionless on the hearthrug . Only the hands twisted , as if in pain . In Gillian 's set , still face such bleak despair was revealed that Hugh was alarmed . Good God , she 's seen her life for what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her foot . Her favorite dull-blue crepe gown to some extent softened her vivid make-up . " Mrs. Tracy does a great deal of good , but she has money and leisure , " Brosia said . " When Gillian makes a killing in the market , she 'll be able to give up her position ; then she 'll have time to take care of herself and do social service work , too . " Gillian shifted her gaze to the fire . She fancied little , elfish faces winked at her from the coals . Give up her position ? Leave Minnestrat and Minnestrat ? When she should have " cleaned up " in the market as all the women who haunted brokers ' offices hoped to do . Why , what should I do without my work ? Gillian felt as if she had suddenly walked into a blank wall and the impact had stunned her . Suppose she resigned ? She had never planned to retire . I 'm  | only forty-nine , I do n't feel that old . I could n't stay at home all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seneth and Brosia have their homes . The office is my place . Coals shifted in the grate so that a little ribbon of fire unrolled across the surface . Hugh 's office phone rang . He limped across the rugs and disappeared . Gillian put up her hands to her hair , for the mass had slipped backward and pins dug into her scalp . Oh , I could n't give up my work . It 's all I have . " Suppose I wanted to buy some stock . " Brosia drew back from the fire , afraid , she murmured , of scorching her stockings . " What would I have to do first ? " It ministered to Gillian 's bruised self-respect to be asked to advise Brosia in her purchase of stock . The broker 's office , filled with women who asked questions in a steady stream and listened to none of the answers , fascinated the doctor 's wife , enmeshed in her dreams of wealth . She liked to stare at the board where the quotations were chalked up , though the figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that buzzed on every side of her convinced her that other women were making money , that speculation had only to be handled intelligently to be profitable and safe . The prospect of a Christmas bonus excited the staff of Minnestrat and Minnestrat as soon as the flurry of Thanksgiving had passed . It must be marvelous to work in an office where they handed you a lump sum of money at Christmas , the wistful Brosia sighed . Seneth observed that she could use a bonus herself ; the needs of the children anticipated her income each month . At the office most of the clerks asserted that the firm distributed  | a bonus solely for the purpose of reducing its income tax . An clement of uncertainty as to whether three , five , or ten per cent . would be paid fomented irritation , for the majority of employees planned to spend the money in advance . A faction argued that since five per cent . had been paid the year before , it would be reasonable to expect ten per cent . this year . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't dare make it less than ten . They 're coining jack . It 's no more than they ought to do ? fork over a big , fat bonus . Look at what the Wall Street firms do for their employees ! " On the other hand , a few fearful conservatives argued , plenty of firms were distributing bonuses of only three per cent . It was decided to hope for five , but to expect ten . " What will you do with the money if you get ten per cent. ? " Brosia interrupted her shuffling of the cards to ask . She and Hugh , Gillian and Seneth were playing bridge after dinner , in the Kents ' blue-and-rose living room . The desultory game amused Hugh , who cared nothing for cards . He perceived that his two sisters-in-law wished to go home , but remained because they believed they were helping Brosia to perfect her bidding . Brosia , Hugh fathomed , regarded her sisters as poor players , detrimental to her own skill , but she was determined to afford them an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of herself , as usual , Hugh mused , and four of us wasting two damn good hours . " Yes , how are you going to get rid of all your money , Gilly ? " he said . " Well ? " Gillian watched the diamonds sparkling in Brosia 's rings . " I have n't thought it out ? " Gillian lifted her gaze to the framed picture of a woman on the table  | behind Brosia . The wealthy Mrs. Tracy had a round , convex face , like a soup plate , on which her extremely heavy eyebrows seemed to float like crusts of bread . She had presented her photograph adequately set in ebony and gold . " I suppose Mrs. Tracy will give you something lovely again this year ? " Gillian saw that Brosia had begun to deal . She tried never to think about that , Brosia affirmed , her large thick hands showing red against the cards in spite of her skin massage . Mrs. Tracy was a wonderful friend , her gifts were incidentals , quite beside the perfect understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would n't do for each other ? Oh , Hugh , I 'm so sorry . I know you want to get on with the game . But I like to be sociable , not take cards too seriously when Seneth and Gillian are with us . " " After all , we play for the pleasure of it , do n't we ? " Seneth , sorting her cards , paused to pull the score pad toward her . She must reread the value of the different tricks every hand she played . They played for perhaps an hour ; then Gillian insisted she needed her sleep to prepare her for the next day . Seneth , who was clever at making over Brosia 's expensive clothes for Lettice , went upstairs with her sister to inspect a satin blouse . Gillian carried her hat out to the console mirror in the hall and stood before it , pushing her hair up under the brim . " It 's harder every year to find a decent hat , " she complained to Hugh , who , hands in pockets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Buy a good one with your bonus . " She poked at the felt crown . " I 'd thought some of sending  | checks . To Cousin Leidy and the girls . And perhaps Seneth 's children , too . " Hugh clamped down his teeth on the pipestem . " Hell and damnation , woman , how long are you going to wait before you get anything out of life ? Blow your money in ! Gamble it away ! Go to a hotel and stay for a week ! Eat cake ! But spend every cent on yourself . That 's sound psychological advice from your doctor , my dear . " " I might get a fur coat . " Gillian pulled out a hairpin as long as a dinner fork , inserted it skillfully on the other side of her head . The doctor made a flying leap at her , laughed as she ducked back . " Buy that coat ! Pay a lot for it . I 'll lend you the balance if you fall short . " He waved the pipe as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need is to go off the deep end and rouse terrible fierce envy in the breasts of every woman friend you 've got , " he counseled . Brosia and Seneth returned , Brosia uneasy because she had had to search for the blouse . " I 'm so sorry to hold you up , Gillian . I hope you have n't been too warm with your coat on . Do n't you want to slip it off for a few moments before you go out into the cold ? Well , all right , but I 'd hate to have you get grippe again . Wait , dear , there 's a button loose . Shall I just catch it for you ? Then let me pull it off , so you wo n't drop it . Once a button 's gone , you might as well make up your mind to buy a new set . " She kissed Gillian , kissed Seneth , as she always did when she met them or parted from them . " Lovely to have you , Seneth . Sure the coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn to take it black , dear , it has a better flavor and is n't nearly so harmful . If you lie awake you must take a little bromide  --  that 's  | all right , is n't it , Hugh ? Oh , wait , Gillian , he 'll be glad to give you both a lift home . It 's no trouble for him . He 's going out , anyway ? " Hugh said , " I 'm selling Gillian a fur coat . " As much to her surprise as his , Gillian bought the coat . She wrapped her stolid figure in the black caracul , beneath which her skirts looked embarrassingly short to her , and created a pleasant sensation at the family dinner party New Year 's Day . It was Seneth 's turn to entertain , and her children greeted Gillian 's magnificent appearance with the mixture of admiration and awe they might have accorded a trick bear . Mary and Lettice must each try on the silky garment , appraise the ripple , and curl of the fur . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mary 's beautiful , excited face glowed in the depths of the shirred collar . Her husband would undoubtedly buy her any kind of coat she desired , Hugh promised her , and Lettice declared shrilly that she meant to buy sealskin with the first money she earned . " Maybe some day you 'll get a bonus , same as your Aunt Gillian . " Cousin Leidy , folded primly into the red wing chair , looked very faded and small . Gillian , submitting to having wisps of hair pinned up by Seneth , murmured that if either of the girls were invited to any little evening parties , they might borrow her coat to wear as a wrap . " I do n't expect to use it much the first winter . " She feels better now , Hugh thought , probably she reasons that the recording angel has it down in black and white that she does n't intend to be selfish about her new coat . Funny system of bookkeeping women credit to Heaven . He  | noticed that Christopher hovered close to Seneth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt or grieved . Rhodes and Lettice disappeared ; Mary , trying to answer Cousin Waldo 's tiresome questions about the window ferns , surreptitiously consulted her Christmas wrist watch . The three sisters occupied the big davenport , with Cousin Leidy facing them . Hugh , on a prowl , glanced at the photographs of the children on Seneth 's desk , wondered what had happened to the tiny picture of Frank Cleveland that had once occupied the place of honor . Well , she 's been a widow going on ten years , maybe she has it on her dresser , or tucked away in a keepsake box . No , I think I 've seen it in her room . Wonder if she ever thinks of David Knight . I still think he could have saved her to a happy life . She seems to be managing the children better than she did , though . A few years ago she had me worried for fair . " Seneth , we have neither a bonus nor a new fur coat . Mine 's almost three years old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slump emphasized in both her sisters ' comfortable , wide hips . One of them had a husband , the other had children , Gillian interposed . Only at Christmas time and New Year 's ? through the holidays  --  she minded not belonging , she told herself . The rest of the year she considered her life to be fairly pleasant and not without compensations . Sencth 's arm about Christopher tightened . The lad , thirteen now , but appearing younger , patted her cheek . " You 're just as well off without children , perhaps . " As usual , Seneth 's voice was rich and sweet . Mary , she added , was anxious to have dinner early , so that she might run off to a party . " And Rhodes has ruined the day for me , but I  | wo n't tell you about it now . We 'll try to enjoy our dinner . " An awkward , silent moment , then Cousin Leidy , pathetically eager to be a cheerful guest , said , " Why do n't you buy stocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy with a dozen scents of trouble , perceived she had returned to the earlier discussion as safe ground . He laughed . " Brosia has a husband and even if she has no bonus , she has some stocks . Only , you see , Cousin Leidy , it 's like this : in winter watered stocks freeze and frozen assets wo n't buy fur coats . " Angie , grayer , stouter , her dignified holiday manner matching her dignified best uniform and apron , stood in the doorway . " Dinner is served , Mrs. Cleveland . " With two men and the boys almost grown up , you might say , Angie thought , getting up a dinner with plenty of good rich gravy is worth while . " It 's like this , Auntie . " Rhodes hammered on a black walnut , grunted as the shell splintered . " I want a job . " He and Gillian had Angie 's now immaculate kitchen to themselves . Hugh and Brosia , after dinner , had offered to drop Mary at her party , and Seneth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's heavy new car held seven comfortably , there would be room for everyone , he had urged . Do them all good to get a breath of fresh air between the mince pie and supper as Seneth planned it . Gillian , who hated motoring , had begged off , Rhodes and Lettice had declared vaguely they had a dozen things to do . Cousin Waldo and Cousin Leidy , so eager to see a feature film that they were willing to stand in line for half an hour , left as soon as they could decently say good-by.  | When she had helped Angie with the dishes and had seen her happily on her way to her married sister 's flat , Gillian remembered the bag of black walnuts on the pantry floor . It would be nice to make a batch of fudge for Seneth , who still had a girl 's fondness for sweets . Rhodes and Lettice , at the radio in the living room , had tried to dissuade Gillian . " Mother cats too much candy  --  it 's bad for her skin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was clear . " Makes her fat , too . She 's got enormous hips . " Rhodes , dialing , scowled at the static . But he followed Gillian to the kitchen and offered to crack the nuts . She smiled at him as she measured the milk in a cup . No one in college , she remonstrated , required a job . By the time Rhodes was graduated , he 'd have his pick of offices . Everyone said the openings for young college men were so numerous the graduates had only to pick and choose . " I must finance myself . " Rhodes , dark , tense , looked older than twenty . He brought the hammer down upon a walnut , let the sections drop into his hand . " Look here , Auntie , you might as well know the truth . Mother and I just do n't hit it off . If she puts me through two more years of college , she 'll expect to direct my entire life . And , hell , I have to manage my own life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him find a job , he explained , perhaps not in her office , but with some business firm . No , he had n't told his mother . " You ca n't talk things over with Mother  --  she takes things too hard . " Gillian 's shadow on the kitchen wall leaped about , a distorted , toppling pagoda . The strong light beating on the tower of her hair revealed it thickly streaked with gray . She absently watched Rhodes help himself to a crinkled nut-.  | meat . " Your mother 's whole life is centered on you , dear , " Gillian said . " Well I 'll be damned if ? I 'm sorry , Auntie . That 's the whole trouble , and I tell you I wo n't have her life center on me ! " Rhodes let the hammer drop to the floor , he my life , is n't it ? If I get a job and pay my own way , I can run my own life , ca n't I ? " He gripped the table edge , staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be his task to transmute into understanding . But she 's old , she believes in always giving up . Uncle Doctor says a sacrificing woman feeds her victims with her own blood . I do n't want to drink my mother 's blood , do I ? The radio blared , softened , then gritted with static , guttural and hoarse . Paper rustled and rattled as Gillian opened the brown sugar bag . Funny , brown sugar always looked like damp sand , he 'd noticed that the last time they were at the shore , Rhodes thought . Before he 'd entered college and when Mother had rented the Point Ellen cottage , the year Mary had been determined to study acting with Miss Hoben . Mother had her way , Mary 's never seen Miss Hoben since . Lettice studied French instead of shorthand . Mother knows best . " I 'm not thinking just of myself , Auntie , " Rhodes lied . " I 'm costing the mater too much money . She has three other children , you know . If you help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . " Gillian measured the sugar into the milk , stirred the mixture gently with a silver spoon . " If you speak to your mother and she is willing , I 'll do what I can . But I think you should stay where you are till you have your diploma . "  | He intended to study nights , her nephew assured her . Hundreds of fellows worked days , attended classes at night . They were still arguing when the others returned . Seneth , assisted by Brosia and Gillian , began supper preparations immediately in spite of protests that no one could touch a mouthful of food . " The best part of any holiday dinner is the cold turkey at night , " Seneth told them . Rhodes escaped to his own room where he worked furiously at columns of figures until Hugh Kent tapped at the door . " I 'm not hungry . Do n't want to eat . " Rhodes chewed his pencil , frowned at the doctor in the doorway . " Meaning ? " " Well , I think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So do I , but not till after supper . " Hugh limped to the couch , sat on the edge , away from the shelves on the wall . " I keep my distance from a hanging bookcase , since mine at college came down on my neck , " he said . In answer to Rhodes 's questions , he admitted that Seneth had told him during the drive that her oldest son wished to leave college and go to work . " Until she can see your point of view , this thing is going to be pretty hard on her , lad . You must be patient , and for God 's sake do n't be unnecessarily rough . " " She wo n't play fair . She 'll faint , or be ill . Perhaps she 'll have another spell like that time up in the country . Why do n't I just clear out and let it go at that ? " Hugh said in a low tone , running his words together so rapidly that his listener could sort them into sentences only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from a woman now , you 're whipped . What your mother does she ca n't help ,  | perhaps ; she 's set in the ghastly mold of maternal sacrifice . Your mold is n't set , but you have no time to lose . Afraid of your mother , afraid of your wife . Unable to oppose your mother , dominated by your wife ? that 's the penalty , unless you choose to fight . " The familiar background of his comfortable room , decorated in tans and browns , split for a moment before Rhodes 's frowning gaze . From his place at his study table he fancied he traced a dark road between his bed on one side of the room and the couch pushed against the other wall . Long and murky and endless , this road , and one must guess whether it lay level or traversed mountains , whether it proved a broad highway or a narrow path . For a brief half-second the image persisted , then the wall shut down , the light washed in . The bellow of Kit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supper . The morning before he was to return to college , after the holiday recess , Rhodes laid a pink slip on Seneth 's desk . She glanced up from the letter she was writing . " It 's your January allowance , darling . " " I wo n't need it . " She pushed the check toward him , her eyes smiling . " You 'll need it later , then . You are not a miser . " " I 'm dropping out of college after midyears . That 's final , Mother . " He thought , she loves distributing and organizing and controlling . She ought to be in some business less personal and dangerous than this of being a mother . Or maybe it 's my fault ; I should have realized before this that the set-up 's wrong . No fellow , twenty years old , has any business taking money from a woman , even if she is his mother .  | My father might have done something about that . I suppose he was afraid of her . Seneth rested her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always done everything I could for you , dear ? " Damn Uncle Doctor , he might have known we would n't get anywhere . The beautiful voice resumed . " Let 's talk it over calmly . You tell me you do n't wish to be a lawyer , but you 're too young to know your own mind . Oh , yes , you are . When you are a bit older , your father 's splendid reputation will mean something to you . The family tradition will be precious in your sight . Your father was the seventh lawyer in the direct line . As his oldest son , surely you 'll be proud to follow his profession some day . " It does n't mean a thing , maybe I 'm a bad actor , but it sounds phony to me . " You know I do everything I can for my children , freely and gladly . " Seneth glanced at the still , dark figure beside her desk . " Perhaps I 've made a mistake in letting you take too much for granted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education is something of a drain on my resources , dear . I give up so gladly for you , but there is considerable sacrifice involved that you of course do not see . " Rhodes stretched out his hand , replaced the glass cover on the inkwell , fitting it in place as if the slightest sound must disqualify him for some imaginary reward . " Most sacrifice is a waste , Mother . " " That 's one of Hugh 's silly remarks  --  you 've been talking with him . " Anger quickened Seneth 's tone . " Because Hugh has forgotten , utterly and completely , the debt he  | owes his wife , must you imitate him and be heartless , too ? Do n't you believe in gratitude ? " " Do you believe Uncle Doctor owes Aunt Brosia anything , Mother ? " Seneth braced her shoulders against the ladder back of her desk chair . Her green-and-white cotton housedress , shirred at the waistline , accented the width of her hips . The skin of her throat and face flushed red and damp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used . " My darling , there are only a few fundamentals , and they never change , " she said ? and no one could doubt her sincerity . " You 're old enough to know , surely , what I 've tried to teach you , to teach all my children : to recognize right from wrong , never to put self first , and to pay the debts of love with gratitude . These values remain fixed . " Sickeningly sweet , pervasive , the odor of paper narcissus , heavy in the warm air , penetrated to the consciousness of Rhodes . A spike of flowers had bloomed among the bulbs planted in an amethyst glass bowl . Insistent and smothering like his mother 's arguments , like them rooted in sand . But pretty , too , in a stiff way , and I remember as a kid I thought it all a miracle , because they started to grow in the dark . " What does Uncle Doctor owe Aunt Brosia , Mother ? " " His education . She put him through medical school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and practice during the War . His success . She made Hugh give up the grind of general practice and specialize . All her time and money and effort for years has been spent on him . " " Does she love him ? " Seneth 's lips parted , but the smile faded as she met the  | glance of her son 's cold , hard eyes . " Yes , she loves him . Dearly . " " Has she a right to control his life ? " " She happens to have more executive ability than he has . Hugh was without ambition until he met your aunt . Now he 's a successful , useful man . " " Not a happy man ? " Seneth fingered her gold chain . She wore it concealed under the collar of her frock now , for the children disliked the ornament and Lettice had once complained bitterly that the baby teeth gnashed at her in derision . Poor Rhodes , the mother reflected , he 's in a turmoil , because he does n't know what he wants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ca n't see their future as a clear , straight path . It 's a critical period , always , for they can so easily wreck their beautiful young lives . If I can only help my boy ! " If your mother , darling , is willing to give up whatever is necessary in order to put you through college and law school , your part is to be guided by her judgment , is n't it ? " " I ca n't see it . " " You 'll thank me some day . " He retreated stealthily , though his body still leaned against the desk . A coldness that was hard and stiffening and reassuring firmed his heart , fortified the tissues of his mind . When he spoke , it seemed to him that he addressed his mother from a long distance . " This is n't a movie , Mother . " Prescience startled her so that her heart thudded under the flesh between her breasts . Her dark eyes opened wide , imploring him to spare her . " How can you be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because she saw that she  | had not roused him . Terrified , she murmured pitiful appeals and the weapons that had hitherto never failed her fell harmless in the wide , clear space between her and this strange , remote son . " It 's for you . I have n't had a thought for myself since the day you were born . " " God knows how much better it would have been for us , if you had . " " But I brought you into the world . I 'm responsible for you . Since your father died I 've dedicated my life to you . " " In return you demand our lives . " " You do n't understand . I 'm building for your future . All that I dream for you ? well , let that wait . I gave up a second marriage for your sakes ? " Rhodes snapped off a narcissus head , flung it to the rug . " You 've shut everyone out of your life , Mother . You 've deliberately made sure that , except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one we 'll pull free , as I am pulling free . It is n't exactly a disease , like leprosy , to have one 's children leave home ? " " Leave home ! " " ? but the way mothers talk , you 'd think it was their hands and feet that dropped off . " " My darling , wait until you have a child ! " This , thought Rhodes , in sudden despair , will go on forever . But he tore up the check when Seneth pressed it into his hands and dropped the pieces into the narcissus bowl . He was leaving college , he reiterated , after midyears . For good .  | As IF IT WAS N'T enough to have broken his mother 's heart by leaving college . " Gillian , removing the pins from her heavy , streaked , gray hair , stared contentedly at herself in the glass . Mrs. Lane saw to it that the mirrors in her beauty parlor were hung in the best light to flatter her patrons in their quest for youth . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shampoo solution vigorously , sighed . " When they 're little , they get in the way of your feet , when they 're big they tramp on your heart . " Mrs. Lane had no time to expend on her own grooming . Her bleached , ropy hair hung in dejected strings , her eyebrows were crudely penciled , perspiration streaked the several layers of her hastily renewed make-up . Hair dye discolored her finger nails , her uncorseted figure billowed and bulged under her salmon pink uniform . " Is he the oldest , the one you tell me has a girl ? " A bell rang , she ducked under the booth curtain to see who had entered with the opening of the outer door . The small enclosure was oppressively stuffy , but Gillian , who had formed the habit of having a shampoo every other week , accepted the compound odor of steam , oil , dyes , baked hair , and soap without complaint . Mrs. Lane spoke vaguely of a time when she should have a suite of rooms , a dozen driers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Meanwhile she and the majority of her customers preferred the informal atmosphere of the one shabbily equipped room , partitioned off with faded chintz curtains strung on sagging cords . Gillian avoided the smart , immaculate downtown shops where she fancied the pencilslim girls regarded her contours with something like horror and where suave barbers automatically brandished shining shears at the sight of her unfashionable wad of hair . " Why do n't you have it bobbed ? " the young woman clerks in the office persistently suggested . Her nieces , Mary and Lettice , too , teased her to have it cut . Short hair would make her look years younger , they said . But Cousin Leidy declared that for her part it made her sick to see any woman deliberately sacrifice a beautiful head of hair . It used to be , Cousin Leidy mourned , that a head of heavy hair was something to be proud of . Now women who had never had any hair were determined to make it stylish to go scalped . They 'd be bald eventually , some doctor had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair so often , and if women had no better sense than to follow their example , let them take the consequences . Gillian still refused to have her hair waved , tinted or thinned . It had never been a pretty color , its texture was dry and stiff . For years she had been unable to dress it attractively , or to find a hat she could wear in comfort , but in her eyes its length and thickness remained assets . She could never forget that , as a child in grammar school , teachers had exclaimed about her hair . Neither one of her sisters had ever had braids to compare with hers . Later young women with scanty locks had envied her the great  | coil that required thirty-seven hairpins to hold in place . Even now , when hairpins had almost vanished from the notion counters , Gillian continued to regard her hair as her best point . No real woman , she assured herself , could ever prefer a shingle bob to the distinction of having hair long enough to sit on . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the side curtains back , revealing the main section of the shop . A drier , a manicuring table and one permanent waving machine were the principal furnishings . A small glass case in which were false hair pieces and cosmetics to be sold on commission stood in one corner , and on the threadbare cushions of a wicker chair a white cat curled asleep . " You were telling me about your sister 's children . " Mrs. Lane began to dig at Gillian 's scalp with a fine-tooth comb . " You got a touch of dandruff , " she said . " Well , it is n't as if she had n't done everything in the world for them . " Gillian , under the veil of her flowing hair , stared placidly at the shadowy distorted image of her face in the glass . " She 's done everything in the world for them . She helped Mary , the oldest girl , open a dress shop right in the house , to keep her contented at home . Since Rhodes ? the boy I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been employed days and studying nights . My sister does n't take any board from him ? that is , he pays her , but she 's saving it for him . Only now he 's had to take up with this Catholic girl and his mother 's about sick over it . " Mrs. Lane 's comb scratched busily . " I always say marriage is difficult enough without trying to mix two religions . " " Oh , we do n't think they 'll marry . Brosia ? Mrs. Kent ,  | my youngest sister ? says the only thing to do is to ignore the engagement . " " Well , if you 're sure the girl wo n't persuade him . Some girls , you know , have n't a bit of pride , they 'll hound a man to marry them . " That worried Seneth , too , Gillian admitted , losing her dim image as a heavy waterfall of hair whipped across her eyes and nose . It was a wonder Seneth did n't lose her mind , Gillian mused . Rhodes , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must fall in love with a girl who could certainly have no sympathy with his mother 's background and ideals . Then take Mary  --  Mary who had wanted to be an actress , yet who shrank from strangers to the extent that she had never yet sold a dress from her shop to anyone except a relative or a friend . Mary cried a great deal , and alternately sobbed that she would n't disappoint her darling mother and raged that a girl had a right to live her own life . Then there was Lettice .. . " If you 'll just come over to the washstand ... " Gillian rose a hit stiffly , waited for Mrs. Lane to move the chair . Seated again , Gillian tilted her head , slumped on her spine so that the aluminum drain fitted into her neck . A cascade of warm water , tingling like the grip of rubber fingers , slid across her scalp . There was Lettice , who talked of nothing except her determination to be self-supporting . She despised the dress shop racket , Lettice ranted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to live away from home . To hear her , Gillian reflected , you 'd think she hated her home . Well , Seneth has Kit . I 'm sure he 's a comfort at present , but there 's no telling how soon the others will infect him . Seneth  | feels that Hugh is to blame for a large part of the children 's rebellion against her authority , and she may be right . I 'd never bring up the question though , because Brosia is finding him difficult enough to live with as it is . Gillian wiped her eye with a corner of the Turkish towel . " Married or single , we all have our troubles , I guess . " " You said it . " Mrs. Lane turned on the rinsing spray . " I 'll wager both your sisters often envy you , Miss Fields . With a nice job and a good salary , you do n't have to lie awake nights , wondering where your children are or whether your husband 's true to you . If I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I looked at a man . " You ca n't have everything , Gillian told herself when Philip Minnestrat raised her salary that May and Cousin Leidy had to have all her teeth out . There was no thrill in paying dental bills for poor Cousin Leidy , who had a malformed jaw and whose new plates distorted her mouth hideously . Since she could eat no solids , she prepared only soups and other liquids ? so that her always insipid meals now became a succession of gruels , pale and without taste . Cousin Waldo , perhaps through sympathetic association , developed trouble with his eyes . His visits to the oculist conferred on him a brief importance , he was pathetically grateful for the interest of the drugstore clerk . Even his collection of medicine bottles and eyedroppers represented individual possessions to a little old man whose special articles were few . He closed his eyes to rest them when he sat on the side porch after supper , and Cousin Leidy removed her teeth to relieve her aching jaws . Gillian read aloud to them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her cousins liked to be read to . Hugh Kent , whenever he found the three enduring their miscast roles , openly grinned . He was at work he sometimes murmured , on mathematical calculations that would , when published , establish the ratio of energy wasted in mistaken forms of sacrifice . The telephone interrupted Gillian in the third paragraph of a long editorial one cloudy , warm evening . Seneth had called , her sister 's rich voice explained , to ask if Lettice happened to be there . " Here ? Why , no . I have n't seen Lettice for more than a week , Seneth . " In the little dark hall one had to keep an eye on the kitchen door . If it opened unexpectedly , it must swing against whoever should be seated at the phone . Seneth mumbled , evidently putting her lips close to the mouthpiece . " I ca n't hear a word you say . " Gillian braced her foot against the door . If either of her cousins decided to go to bed , they 'd march @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear you , Seneth . Is anything the matter with Lettice ? " ... She 's taken her clothes . That is , the brown suitcase is missing . Angie says she saw it under the bed in Lettice 's room yesterday . " Gillian forgot the door , anxiety swift as a rising wind tore distractedly at her mind . That Seneth could , without being definite , suggest so many terrifying possibilities , irritated Gillian to the point of frenzy . " The child 's somewhere in the house , of course . You have n't looked . Or she may have gone to Brosia 's . There is n't a bit of sense in getting all upset , just because ? You ca n't expect to have your children under your feet every minute ? When did you see her last ? "  | " At lunch time . And I 've already phoned Brosia . They 're out , but the maid answered . Lettice is n't there . " Cousin Waldo opened the door , which banged against Gillian 's knee . " Excuse me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He backed cautiously , left the door ajar . The crack which enabled him to listen widened and narrowed as his unsteady hand jerked the knob . The obvious , suggested by Gillian , offered no solution . Yes , Seneth admitted , she had questioned Rhodes . He knew nothing of any plans Lettice might have made to leave home , she had not confided in him . He was out searching for his sister now . Yes , Seneth agreed again , they had called up the few girls Lettice knew intimately , they were all at home , all surprised to hear that Lettice had not been on hand for dinner . No , she could have very little money , probably only a few cents . " You know I do n't approve of letting children handle money until they 're old enough to realize value . And Lettice has been so stormy lately , so rude to me , that I kept back her allowance last month . Oh , Gillian , do you suppose anything will happen to her ? She 's such a baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could possibly happen to Lettice , everyone said . In the three weeks following her disappearance , weeks in which Seneth , white and dry-eyed , could find relief only in motion and that motion pacing the house , the safety of a seventeen-year-old girl alone in a large city was never questioned ? not in the hearing of her mother , who pathetically tried to reconcile her references to her " baby girl " with the assurances thrust upon her that female creatures of seventeen were virtually women and able to fend for themselves . " Why , my mother was seventeen when I was born . She  | married at sixteen . " Red-haired , homely Jim Kennard , whose services had been offered by Philip Minnestrat , urged that girls at seventeen were remarkable for their good sense . " Lots of them get married and make swell little wives at that age . " Jim was not a detective ? Seneth had a horror of detectives and of the police  --  but he performed confidential missions for many of the Minnestrat clients . Like Jerry Cruncher in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were no rust stains on Jim 's knotted fingers . While Brosia stayed with Seneth and Gillian relieved her after office hours , I high and Rhodes and Jim Kennard carried the search forward . They were slow and clumsy , perhaps , but Hugh agreed with Seneth that the police must be the last resort . " She 'll come back voluntarily , let us hope , if we can keep her out of the public prints . But once she 's found , no one must force her to give reasons for leaving home . Lettice has chosen her method for avoiding scenes ? I wish we could get your mother to see that , " the doctor said to Rhodes . His mother never understood anything she did n't wish to see , Rhodes declared coldly . He wore shell-rimmed glasses now , had put on weight . His very real sympathy for his mother 's grief was constantly tried by her refusal to recognize any mistakes on her part or to admit that a just grievance against parental authority and control could be cherished by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his fiancee , in the family councils , and this , Hugh perceived , hurt and antagonized Rhodes , who even in a crisis retained his interest in his individual rights . Seneth had chosen to ignore his engagement to Catherine  | Miller , she had never paid the girl and her parents the conventional call etiquette prescribed . This slight , presumably intentional , had been magnified by Catherine , nervously alert for " insults " from her prospective mother-in-law . Catherine declared she was sorry about Lettice , she hoped nothing had happened to her , but Rhodes need n't spend every evening with his mother till they found Lettice , need he ? The Millers had a telephone , Rhodes could keep in touch with his uncle and Jim Kennard from there . Rhodes would not confess to Hugh that the efforts of Catherine to uncover the relationship between Lettice and her mother annoyed him . If Catherine could draw from him the admission that Seneth had driven her own daughter from home , the position of a daughter-in-law , in the event of future disagreements , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood nor cherished compelled Rhodes to protect his mother from the criticism of an alien clan . He had no love for Seneth , he told himself , his duty to her did not demand that he be sentimentally blind ; but he 'd be damned if he 'd be bulldozed into saying that Mrs. Miller , Catherine 's mother , fulfilled his ideals . Mrs. Miller made plenty of mistakes of her own . The cautiously worded newspaper personal , the stealthy tracing of clues , the patient , secret interviews , all failed . In the end a chance word dropped in a neighborhood grocery store sent Jim Kennard on what he believed to be a wild goose chase ? he himself , as he explained , taking the part of the goose . But the door on which he knocked was opened by a wiry girl with green-blue eyes who first refused to answer his questions and then answered them in detail by bursting into tears .  | Lettice , as " mother 's helper , " had been interrupted in her task of washing spinach for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-two months old . The devotion of the babies , who cried because Lettice cried , impressed Kennard , as did the bewildered dismay of stout Mrs. Koonz , summoned from her vegetable store on the first floor of the three-family house . " But Anna is such a good girl . Not handy yet , but so willing . It is hard " ? Mrs. Koonz glanced distractedly from Lettice , silent , sullen , to Kennard , who nodded ? " to find a girl who is patient with children . Already Anna stays longer than any of my other girls . " No one asked for references or demanded a young woman 's history , Mrs. Koonz assured her visitor , indulgent toward his evident lack of experience . " Not when you got two babies and a store . I know a nice girl , I take her when she asks for work . Sure , I had an advertisement in . Seventeen ? I earned my living at fourteen . But I made up a bed for her in the little room back of the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep out . It do n't look so good . " Since Lettice refused to accompany Kennard , he had to leave her to finish the spinach . Mrs. Koonz promised him to be responsible for the girl until her mother , or some member of the family , should come for her . To the despair of Hugh Kent and the amazement of the jubilant Jim , Seneth collapsed under the weight of what she termed the " disgrace . " To think , she moaned , that her daughter must be found as a kitchen maid in a shoddy , commonplace household ! Rhodes quarreled hotly with her point of view , but Hugh , saddened and hopeless , perceived that her pride fed on her children , that their success or failure , as she interpreted  | it , reflected on her . She drains nourishment from them for the roots of her emotional life . She fed their bodies , now she demands that they keep alive her soul . In her middle age she 's a parasitic growth . Lettice announced hardily that she intended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school in the fall . However , the combined influence and authority of Hugh , coupled with Mrs. Koonz 's reluctance to employ a young woman whose mother shuddered at domestic service as menial , induced the runaway to return home within a few days . She was irritable and sullen , and Seneth confided to Hugh that a woman 's happiest days were when her children were small . " Then you know where they are , you give them what you can , and it 's enough , " Seneth said wistfully . Rhodes , she added , had no thought for his mother , he was completely wrapped up in his girl . Mary blamed her , Seneth , because her career as an actress and the dress shop , too , had failed . " And Lettice keeps threatening me . She 'll run off again , she says , unless I send her to secretarial school . " Hugh sighed . " Why do n't you ? " " Because there 's no need for her to earn her living . Her father would never have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home with me until she marries ? But no , she must be one of these shrill-voiced , arrogant , hard-faced office workers who fight for bus seats and stand up at counters to eat their lunches . Kit 's the only one of my children who has never given me a moment 's anxiety , the darling . " If women could only learn to worry over the right things !  | Hugh squared his shoulders as he left his sister-in-law . Seneth ought to be forced to see that the antagonism and rebellion of her older children had in it the healthy seeds of independent desire . They were willing to put up a fight to establish themselves as individuals . The kid for her to worry herself sick about is Christopher , the doctor fretted . Kit , the courteous , the gentle , the devoted slave . He waits upon his mother and sisters so assiduously that he has no time for boys of his own age . At fourteen he 's a model student and son , according to the reports , but at twenty-one what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brosia and to Gillian that her house was divided . Sometimes , she declared , she could find it in her heart to be thankful that Frank had not lived to see the unity of his family destroyed . " I do n't know whether I can bear to go up to the farm this summer , or not . I always remember what the minister of that little village church said of us years ago when the children were small ; he said lie had never seen such a united family . " But late in June , when Kit 's school had closed , Seneth did make arrangements to spend the summer at the farm . She and Mary and Kit , with Angie , took possession of the country house . Rhodes was left in the city , with Lettice to act as his housekeeper . They were to drive up in Rhodes 's small car for the week-ends . " At least having to look after his sister and bring her up to me every Saturday will remind him that he still owes his family something , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seneth announced . An influx of summer visitors , increasing year by year , had doubled the population of the section , changed forever its normal , rural aspect . Many of the " summer people " had  | bought up small farms or built artistic cabins on subdivided plots . Their presence stimulated the ambition of Mary , whose restlessness puzzled her mother . Mary was gentle , she did not anger easily , but she possessed a fund of obstinacy that was like a core of iron in the center of her apparently pliable will . She must make some money of her own , the girl reiterated , but when Seneth pressed her ? " Does n't Mother buy you everything you need ? What do you want money for ? " ? the lovely face stiffened like a mask . " She 's determined to open a tea room and nothing I can say will stop her , " Seneth wrote to Brosia . " I should be thankful , I suppose , that she is willing to experiment in her home . She may be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the services of Angie for three days a week . " She had also advanced the capital needed for new dishes and linens , Seneth revealed . " Why does n't the girl get married and have babies , instead of dress shops and tea rooms ? " Hugh Kent inquired of his wife . " She 's wasting her energies and Seneth 's money on a lot of tommyrot . " Brosia explained vaguely that Mary was the quiet type . " She 's never had but one beau . " " Well ? " He lived next door to the Clevelands , Brosia murmured , he was all right in his way , but it was an utterly ordinary , commonplace way . " Besides , his family has no money . You do n't want Mary to marry the only man she 's ever really met , do you ? " Biologically , Hugh instructed , that would be the correct thing for Mary to do . " She 's pretty , not a world-beater for brains , but with normal instincts ? and she does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she wants out of it are good . A husband , a home and babies will set her up for keeps . Any ordinary , healthy young man will meet her ideals , and this next-door chap is Johnny on the spot . She falls in love , they marry , neither of them ever sets the universe aflame . But they do have a set of ordinary , wholesome kids , and the world goes on . " Hugh 's left eyebrow formed its accent mark . He sat at his office desk facing his wife , who had brought Seneth 's letter in to read to him . " What 's wrong with the picture ? " " There 's more to marriage than simply marrying the first man who presents himself and then having three or four children . " Brosia , who had had her hair tinted , moved her chair out of the direct sunlight . Hugh lifted the lid from his cloisonne tobacco jar , began to fill his pipe . " There 's no distorted sacrificial motive in Mary 's story as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ martyr herself for those she loves . So you figure that marks her for failure as a wife . " The child was n't even thinking of marriage , Brosia protested , not looking at him but smiling gently at a point to the side of his right temple , a trick she had perfected through the years . She must round up patrons for the tea room , Brosia planned . Mrs. Tracy would love to motor up with half a dozen friends , others would be glad to know of a new place serving food . " We ought to take Gillian up with us next Sunday , Hugh . She works too hard in that old office . " Mrs. Tracy and Gillian had dutifully purchased frocks they did n't need in Mary 's dress shop , they could be depended upon as loyally to ride eighty miles to buy waffles and creamed chicken on toast .  | Mary , as the summer progressed , welcomed her guests , fed them indifferently and perceived that her expenses exceeded her receipts . Lettice , thin , bossy , offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nervous voice , each time she arrived with Rhodes . It irritated Seneth that the three , Mary , Rhodes and Lettice , argued incessantly and that Rhodes persistently held up Catherine Miller as an example for his sisters to follow . The three Miller girls were all self-supporting : Catherine had a " nice " job with a large insurance company , Lila was a nurse , Mabel a stenographer on the personnel staff of a department store . " But they have no brothers . " Seneth refused to be impressed by this efficiency record . " Men do n't support the women in their family any more , Mother . That is , except wives , and lots of times wives have to work , too . " Lettice thought hopefully of the pothooks with which she struggled in the long , hot summer afternoons . She had borrowed the money from Rhodes to pay her tuition in a shorthand and typing class , but at times she doubted her ability to finish the course before her mother returned to the city . Others girls , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mastered the intricacies of the baffling loops far more quickly than she did . One Saturday afternoon early in August , Hugh , Brosia and Gillian , in the Kents ' car , drove into the farmhouse drive , relieved to find it empty except for Rhodes 's light coupe . The absence of parked cars indicated that the tea room trade had fallen off , and the doctor thought it safe to trust that Angie 's undivided attention might be concentrated upon dinner for the family group . Seneth , her face blotched  | from the heat , her neck and arms spottily covered with hastily applied talcum , said that she had hoped Lettice might be with them . " I do n't know what Rhodes could be thinking of , to allow his sister to stay in the city without him . " Seneth nodded to Kit , who advanced with a tray . " I may have to go to town , if I can get anyone to drive me in . Someone will have to find out where Lettice is . " Christopher served the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arm of his mother 's Adirondack chair . The terrace , where they were all seated , boasted a set of red-and-white chairs now , and a table with an awningstriped umbrella under which no one ever sat . But the green basin in which the orchard was rooted still reminded Hugh of the pattern of a china plate . It was silly to worry about Lettice , Rhodes stated , with the clipped distinctness that always betrayed his effort to keep- his temper under control . He lit a cigarette , carefully placed the match in a glass ash tray . " I 've explained to you , Mother , that she 's staying with the Pattersons . They 've lived on the street as long as we have . Lettice has known Grace Patterson since we went to grammar school . " " But what reason did she give for not coming with you ? " " Lettice hates motoring . It makes her back ache . Ca n't she have a rest over one week-end ? " Something was wrong , Seneth insisted , the heavy weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She scarcely touched her food at dinner and left the table before dessert to telephone the Pattersons ' . Delay in getting the connection increased her alarm . When Central reluctantly reported that  | the Patterson phone was temporarily disconnected , Seneth announced that she would n't be able to sleep at all . " They have n't paid their bill , that 's what temporarily disconnected ' always means . They 're not away for the summer ; they always stay at home . The least you can do , Rhodes , is to inform yourself about the people with whom you permit your young sister to spend the night . " Rhodes escaped by offering to drive Mary and Christopher into the village to the one motion-picture house . Seneth and Gillian , with the Kents , played bridge till midnight . The telephone rang twice . Each time Seneth cried out that Lettice had sent a telegram , that the message , read over the wire , would reveal bad news . In the morning Hugh found himself the first one up . The wind had shifted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , like a smothering blanket heavy and wet . He had lain naked , face down , without moving until the gray light of early dawn brushed his skin with faintly cool spears . He had left Brosia sleeping exhaustedly in the next bed , had dressed in the bathroom . The cold shower had been tepid , the lower floor of the house seemed to him to have sealed the warmth and staleness of used lights and expended breath in the airless rooms . He busied himself with opening the windows , set the front door wide . As brief as youth , as fragile as its dreams , the lovely freshness of a new day preceded the rising of the burning August sun . Dew soaked the grass to lush greenness , in the center of the lawn a young rabbit , motionless , alert , posed . Clear , damply cool , a reviving air seemed to rise from the earth , since no breeze stirred the leaves on any tree . Hugh raised his arms above his head , expanded his  | chest , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frantic lope . As the graceful creature streaked from sight , Hugh heard the wheels of a car spatter the gravel in the drive . " What the devil ? " Wet green stems clung to his tennis shoes as he limped across the grass . A small roadster stopped at the foot of the side porch steps . Obviously a secondhand car , the brilliant yellow paint could not gloss over the gouges in the body nor distract attention from the bent fenders and the absence of knobs on the doors . The young man and girl who occupied the scat were intent on tucking a tan-colored blanket in place . They evidently intended it to serve as a slip cover to hide the stained and torn upholstery . The girl , jumping lightly to the ground , glanced at Hugh . " Uncle Doctor ! " Lettice dashed behind the car , reached for his extended hands . Behind him the screen door slammed , then Seneth stood beside him . Two or three steps down Lettice , hatless , dressed in a sleeveless flowered print , tilted her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveyed the awkward , hunched figure of her companion , a boy with a dark , tanned face , dazzling white teeth , and an uncertain grin . Good God , he does n't look a day over sixteen , Hugh thought , and he 's afraid . Now we 'll have a scene , no , this is the scene . Some of us in this group will remember forever how the day begins softly to wither in the mounting sun 's heat , will always hear the whistle of that distant train , or see the shabby althea bush . He said to himself , What will each of us remember ? And it seemed to him that their four figures stood out against a retreating background , like  | people in the old stereopticon slides his grandmother had shown him as a boy . " I 'm married , Mother , " Lettice said . Seneth moistened her lips with her tongue . The membranes of her mouth and throat had dried so that her vocal cords produced only guttural sounds . She struggled to form words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her heart . " Whitey ! " Lettice half-turned , beckoned to the youth , who reluctantly started toward her . He acted rather like a schoolboy summoned to judgment for some infraction of rules . Resentment , fear , defiance tugged at the muscles of his face , his nervous hands tried to pat his curly hair flat . His young , desperate eyes looked past Seneth to the doctor , whose expression was grave . " This is Purdy White , Mother . He married me yesterday afternoon . " Lettice added hurriedly : " This is my mother . And my uncle , Doctor Kent . " Again Seneth struggled to speak . Her lovely voice failed even to croak . She put her hand to her throat , her staring gaze swinging from Lettice to the boy . In the agony that crumbled her soul , the despair that numbed her mind , the habits of her orderly , conventional life strove to function still . The need for words tore at her locked lips , forced a communication through . She whispered : " Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boy a year younger , whose only assets seemed to be a friendly manner and a charming smile . He had left high school in his sophomore year , clerked in a cash grocery store where Lettice had met  | him . His widowed mother actually supported him . But she refused to support his wife . " Mom has an eight-room house and everything handy , so we would n't crowd her . " The young husband shook his curly head . " Women have funny ideas . Mom says her home is open only to me . So of course we could n't stay . " He smoked incessantly , knocked over all small ornaments , and reminded Hugh Kent of an engaging spaniel pup . She could understand Whitey 's mother 's feeling , Seneth declared in frantic conference with Brosia and Gillian . This marriage must inevitably ruin Lettice for life ; the young couple were unsuited to each other in every way . " I think it 's my duty to urge him to return to his mother and leave Letty with me. l lc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he does n't fit into our family circle . " She failed to perceive , in her harassed attempts to bar out this interloper , that she hated not him , but the forces symbolized in him . " We 'll get along , " Whitey said , pleasantly vague . His thin , energetic wife , who insisted that life must adjust itself to her , planned to get jobs for them both . Bossy and maternal , Lettice confidently announced her program : She and Whitey were to work and live in the city house . " For the rest of the summer , at least . I can keep house for Rhodes , too , and we 'll all come up here for week-ends . " The five women slipped from one endless powwow into another , apparently geared to talk on high , as Rhodes complained , hour after hour . He and the doctor escaped in the middle of the afternoon by driving into town for cigarettes . They left Christopher tagging his new brother-in-law , who had set to work on the engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , Rhodes predicted with  | customary bitterness , but he intended to advise her not to allow the bridal couple to make their headquarters in the city house . " This Whitey has been babied by his mother within an inch of his life . He 's married a wife who 's prepared to do the same thing . Why in God 's name did Lettice pick out an infant ? Do you know ? " " Yes , I know . " Hugh , driving , did not avert his gaze from the road . Well , so did he , Rhodes admitted , Lettice had mixed up her maternal impulses with the biological urge , as so many women do . " Unless a man beats sense into them . The first time Catherine turns maternal on me , she gets turned end up . I 've warned her . " It was with the welfare of his sister in mind that he meant to discourage her plan to set up housekeeping under a roof owned by her mother , Rhodes explained . The young husband could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility , but nothing would stir him to action if everything was done to smooth his path . " Lettice will have to drag him up to a job , like a horse to water , and make him like it , " Rhodes said . " She 's able to pull him and herself , too , but she needs an early start . If Mother furnished them a house rent-free , food , and country vacations , what incentive has this high school kid to go to work ? " " Lettice has one main idea , to get away from her mother . " Hugh sighed . " She 's married impulsively , blindly , I 'm afraid , as a gesture of severance . I 'll offer to take her husband down to the city tonight , since his own car is ready for the junk pile ; but unless I 'm mistaken Mrs. Purdy White will raise hell . " On the contrary , the amazing news that Lettice had agreed to a six months ' separation greeted the doctor and  | Rhodes when they returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would live with his mother and save the salary he was to earn . Letty intended to finish her commercial course in the fall , perhaps seek an office position . " Till September she 'll stay with me and be learning to cook and keep house . " Seneth touched her charm chain which the ruffle in the square-cut neck of her dress failed to hide . " I 've promised to help her get her linens together and we 'll do what we can about furniture for a little home . " Fatigue , the strain of long-continued excitement , had wiped all sparkle from the girl 's face when Lettice cornered Hugh in the upstairs hall . She looked very tall , homely and thin . Her mother had n't fooled her for one moment , Lettice announced , speaking with a fierce rapidity in which anger and bitterness fought against tears . " She thinks that if she can keep us apart for six months we 'll be all washed up . In her mind is the hope of an annulment ? she 'll hash that over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with the separation plan for just one reason  --  to get my housekeeping things . And Whitey will toady to his mother and she 'll hand him money . We need all the money we can get . " " My dear ? " " Oh , Uncle Doctor , what hurts me is that you 're like all the rest . You did n't stick up for me , you did n't tell mother that my life is my life . Is n't there any man who can oppose mothers , or are they all too damn weak ? " The things he could n't say to her prickled on his tongue . My darling , you are so young and you have married your child . I wanted something so much better for you . The only thing he could venture to say , and be safely misunderstood , he said . " I have been weak . "  | She did n't even hear him . " Uncle Doctor , I love him so much . I know his faults ? he 's silly , sometimes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think he 'll ever care much about making money . But he 's happy and gay ? and we all take life so hard in this house . Mother 's brand of loving wrecks her , Rhodes is so serious and solemn I always think he 's running a temperature when he laughs . " She turned her head to hide the tears which filled her eyes and thickened her voice . " Whitey is happy ? I want to live with a happy person . I can earn money for us both if I have to  --  I 'll go with him and we can live in a furnished room . Is n't it ever important just to be happy in this world ? " But Purdy White drove away in the Kent sedan , when Hugh and Brosia and Gillian started for the city soon after seven o'clock that night . The abandoned roadster , towed to one side of the barn-garage , presented a dreary sight , the more pathetic because it so obviously suggested the failure of hope ; the glaring yellow paint appeared to accent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drive with Mary , began to cry . " I hate the long summer twilights up here . " It was too early for lights in the house behind her , but shadows had begun to weave a veil for the mountain tops . " I wonder if Whitey is looking at the new moon ? I told him to always make a wish , " Lettice said . " You can have half of all I take in from the tea room . " Mary put her arms around Lettice , kissed her . Seneth opened the door of the guest room the next morning to find the young husband and wife sleeping peacefully in each other 's arms . Lettie had stridently demanded the room  | usually occupied by the Kents , and Seneth had offered to sleep in the next bed ; whereupon Lettice , losing her temper , had denounced the lack of privacy in the American home . " What in the world ? " Seneth now flushed painfully and mottled patches flecked her skin . But her first startled glance had caught the rapture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never seen her happy , have I ? Whitey had come back , Lettice giggled , her arm pressing her husband 's touseled head against her breast . He had never intended to stay away , his acquiescence had been a ruse . " He caught the eleven-thirty train and got here about two this morning , did n't you , Whitey ? Walked from the station and that 's more than a mile . I let him in . " " Well ? " The boy jerked his head up . He smiled at his mother-in-law shyly , spontaneously , the blue of his pajamas setting off the ruddy tan of his skin . " It 's like this . We wanted to be together . " Later in the morning Lettice declared that she simply would not run the risk of having Whitey live with his mother while he hunted for work . " She 'll turn him against me . She hates the sight of me . " Unless they could have the town house , Lettice announced , they 'd rent a furnished room . Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give them references , find them something to do . Seneth , darning Christopher 's stockings , ? she often used needlework as a sedative , ? said quietly : " You 'd better stay here . Both of you . For the remainder of the summer , I mean . " The hammering tumult of her doubts and fears dulled for a moment then . The conflict shifted to the back of her brain where the murmuring , though not stilled , distracted her less . If she goes away from me , she will build  | up a whole new life in which I have no part . Other people will mean more to her than I do . My increasing need of her will be brushed aside . I 've given my life to my children , they must care for me , not leave me to the empty years . The darning needle pricked her finger , Seneth sucked the tiny wound . Kit will never leave me , I have one child who understands . Toward the end of August she wrote Gillian that she hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were having a glorious summer , Purdy White had friends up every week-end . Even if the marriage broke up in the fall , and she confidently predicted that would be the outcome , at least the children would have happy memories to compensate . " I shall feel repaid for all that I have done , or may do , for my children if in their middle age they can look back to happiness , " Seneth insisted , in her fine looped and pointed script . Gillian gave the letter to Brosia to read , who in turn showed it to Hugh . Rhodes had telephoned the doctor the night before to report that Angie had threatened to give notice . He had not been up to the farm for the last two week-ends , Rhodes grumbled , it was too much like a hotel to suit his tastes . " The newlyweds stay abed till ten every morning , and the house is overrun with their boy and girl friends . Mother has never asked Catherine up there for even a day , but she works like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make their own beds . I laid Lettice out for a lazy slut , but of course I know she 's only feathering her nest . " His mother , Rhodes added , expected the marriage to go on the rocks , but Lettice had nothing like that in mind . " I do n't see how Lettice can endure that reedy , immature  | boy as a husband . " Brosia had followed Hugh from his office to the garage . " Do you think they 'll separate , dear ? " The doctor dropped his key ring . Stooping to pick it from the gravel , he said without glancing up : " No , they 'll stick . As the prophet Isaiah tells us , a shoddy husband maketh a shining wife . " " That is n't in the Bible . " Brosia could not be sure ? " Is it ? " Not in the King James Version , Hugh admitted , unlocking the car . " But in a wife 's Bible , yes . Each woman writes her own . "  | IN THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bridegroom with her . Lettice , tanned a cafe-aulait shade and with a new and becoming assurance in her manner , called on Gillian at the office to discuss the question of a job . " Not that I expect to work here , Auntie . The agency has offered me the choice of three places and one 's with a lawyer . I thought I 'd ask your advice . " They stood at a window in Philip Minnestrat 's room , for he was spending the day in Court . Gillian 's thickened figure silhouetted against the light , revealed the spread of hips she had contentedly accepted as the penalty of middle age . An effort to wear her hair low on her neck resulted in an ungainly bun that rested almost on her shoulders . Her clothes Lettice appraised as good but undistinguished , and she wore , the girl reported to her mother , perfectly ghastly shoes . The office , gloomy , a little shabby , impressed young Mrs. Purdy White only because of the shelves of books that towered to the ceiling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exact center of the faded Persian rug , reflected the window light from its plate-glass top . " I 'd like to be secretary to a lawyer , " Lettice said . " It 's wonderful , if your employer happens to be a brilliant man . " Gillian thought gratefully , I 'm glad I 'm not at the beginning . I 'm used to the Minnestrats , they know my ways .  | Safety , security , she reflected , lay in routine , the office was sanctuary now . When I take off my hat mornings , and start work , every trouble recedes . I can forget Cousin Leidy and the house . That 's the way it should be . My work is my life . She let her mind flow out to the rows of files , the baskets of correspondence , the busy staff in the outer office , swept it back to contemplate the seclusion of this inner room , all a part of her existence , all belonging to her familiar ordered system . It 's my life , she thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind ! " Lettice pulled forward one of the red leather chairs , seated herself . She bent down to rub her instep where her satin pump cut the flesh . Her mother , she murmured , did n't wish her to work at all . Just stay at home . Whitey was bitterly opposed to her taking a job in an office where there were no other girls . " Afraid I 'll have an affair with the boss , I suppose . How do you get along with the other women in the office , Auntie ? " Gillian testified that Miss Pratt and Miss Beams , the stenographers , and Miss Dermott , the file clerk , were all very nice . " There 's a harmonious spirit in the office , we 're all friends . " In reality she and the three younger women had so little in common that they ran no risk of conflict . Gillian could not discuss men and clothes with them , she thought their financial condition  --  they were always in debt ? deplorable . She believed them to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the court testimony ran heavy and they were asked to stay overtime , they grumbled incessantly , despite the extra pay . Secretly their indifference toward their work reassured Gillian . A date for the movies  | thrilled them more than the briefs they transcribed for cases headlined in the newspapers , a dance filled their mind to the exclusion of a famous judicial decision . This attitude left the office , the firm , the welfare of all concerned , safely in the possession of Gillian , to whom the imaginary keys were as precious as the actual keys she carried in her purse . The girls might call her dowdy , ? perhaps she looked like a meal bag and she could n't seem to fix her hair any more , ? but she had something better than mere outward show . Her position was recognized , if not in words then in a subtle deference even more flattering to a sensitive mind . Miss Pratt sought her aid in covering up mistakes , Miss Beams , who sometimes collapsed the morning after a heavy date , sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who must be asked for permission to go home . They were always saying , these girls , what they would do if they had her salary . She had never said much to them about her cousins and their house , because no one seemed to understand about Cousin Leidy and Cousin Waldo . " They 're not your father and mother , are they ? " Muriel Beams had asked when Gillian , momentarily staggered by a bill for furnace repairs , had once confided in her . Muriel and her friends loaned their parents money , usually reluctantly , but apparently they recognized no other claims . Lettice had leased a small apartment , she revealed to Gillian when they went out together to lunch . The gloomy tunnel of the coffee shop was lighted by candles , and clouds of cigarette smoke hung over it like a fog . The atmosphere delighted Lettice , whose nerves were always stimulated by noise . She loved eating downtown , the girl declared , she  | and Whitey planned to have most of their meals out . " He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient of his about him . Whitey 's so important now , and so pleased ! " Whitey 's young wife beamed at the mound of relish which accompanied her fried oysters . " I just adore coleslaw and there 's the most wonderful delicatessen just a block from us . " " Would you like to join the Businesswoman 's Club , dear ? " Gillian , loathing cigarette smoke , tried not to cough as Lettice exhaled a vigorous puff . The Businesswoman 's Club , Gillian explained , welcomed new members , especially young members . They never come , once they 're elected , she thought sadly , but perhaps Lettice will know how to make the meetings more attractive . We 're all so  --  so heavy , we just eat and look at one another and then go home . I 've tried getting up programs , but after I 've secured a speaker so few of the members come out I 'm ashamed to ask the woman to talk . " I 'm president , you know , dear , and the members are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people you 'll enjoy meeting , I 'm sure . " She 's like Mother , she calls her friends girls , Lettice thought , drinking water from the dark blue goblet to hide her smile . Aloud she said , " I do n't expect to have much time for clubs , Auntie . Remember , I have to keep house as well as go to business . And both jobs will be new to me . " Seneth grieved for the " loss " of her daughter throughout the fall . She remarked pathetically and frequently that life seemed to grow more difficult the older one grew . " I expected my children to be a comfort to me when they reached a companionable age , " she told Brosia , " but I declare there are times when they appear to be perfect strangers . " Once , after a particularly bitter quarrel with her oldest son , Seneth  | cried that she envied the woman who had never borne a child ; but this blasphemy horrified her as soon as uttered and she slept with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas the three sisters received an invitation to attend the birthday party of old Mrs. Reed . Sarah Reed had been an old lady when Gillian , Seneth and Brosia had been the three Fields girls and ward of the aunt who lived next door to the Reeds . Miss Matty , Mrs. Reed 's daughter , had been Aunt Jane 's closest friend and for this reason they must go to the party , Seneth decreed . " I would n't hurt Miss Matty for the world . She 's given her life to taking care of her mother and she 's probably made big preparations for this affair . Good gracious , how old do you suppose Mrs. Reed is now ? " They computed , using the calendar of family dates ? " She was sixty-nine the year Aunt Jane had the front room papered , remember ? " ? and when they discovered that old Mrs. Reed would be ninety-seven the next Sunday , they realized that Miss Matty must be an old woman , too . " She 's at least seventy-one herself , " Brosia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Aunt Jane her mother was twenty-six when she was born . " The Reeds , mother and daughter , lived in the old house to which Mrs. Reed had come as a bride . Their original neighbors had died or moved away , garages and rooming houses or cheap furnished apartments had replaced the earlier solid , plain , one-family homes . But for twenty-five years Miss Matty had been explaining , " Of course Mother , at her age , ca n't be expected to move , " and she usually added that Mother required a porch and a yard and these  | luxuries were to be found now only in the expensive suburban towns . Mrs. Reed received her birthday guests in the parlor , which was almost exactly as it had been when she and her husband had furnished the house . Net had replaced the lace curtains , for repeated washing and starching had finally worn the Nottingham to shreds . The walnut suite and the numerous china and glass knickknacks were now so old that , though they were neither valuable nor useful , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old house . A green carpet , sprinkled with faded pink roses , covered every inch of the floor . A marble-topped table was placed exactly in the center of the room under a tarnished brass chandelier . The white china lamp on the table was wired for electricity , in spite of Mrs. Reed 's dislike of electric light . She asserted it ruined the eyes . Yet what could one do , she asked , when the city placed so many obstacles in the way of purchasing gas tubing ? " There is nothing so satisfactory as a good droplight , " the old lady lectured with spirit . " The reason so many children wear glasses today is because they do n't have a soft light , like a gas droplight , to read by . " She had not found it necessary to wear glasses till past fifty-five , added Mrs. Reed . At ninety-seven she enjoyed remarkable health . Seated on the small , hard , walnut sofa , placed between the two front windows like a tapestry-covered throne , she played the role of hostess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrunken figure , her shriveled yellow face , might have been animated by some hidden fire . Her tiny , beady eyes sparkled , the little claw hands gesticulated as she spoke in a voice that crackled , brittle and high . She remembered  | everyone , she gibed maliciously , reveling with childlike mischievousness in her security from reproof . Baskets of flowers , huge bouquets , engulfed her to her knees . It rather shocked Hugh Kent , who had driven his wife and her sisters to the reception , when he first glimpsed the tiny body jerking from side to side above the flowers ; as if a corpse had sat up in its coffin , he thought . Then the old lady had grasped his hand and pulled him down beside her . " I like men . " She smiled at him , the network of her wrinkles puckering like ridges on wet sand . " I never meet men any more . When my husband was alive , he had men friends come to the house . Now the place is overrun with women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . " It would have been different , if my son had lived . " The doctor saw her bald scalp shining under the thin strands of her yellow white hair . The skin of her palm resting upon his wrist felt pulseless , dry . Daughters were best , he assured her , wondering where Miss Matty was . Sons went off to live their own lives , it was the girls who took care of the mothers , when mothers grew old . " Well , maybe . " Mrs. Reed pressed against his arm . The trouble with Matty , she informed him , was that she never married . That made her set in her ways . " I was married at seventeen . Just could n't keep the boys away , seemed like . Matty never had a beau , as I remember . " The old lady grasped a cane which lay on the couch beside her . She pounded it smartly on the floor . As if the rapping had evoked a spirit , Miss Matty darted in from the kitchen . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as old as her mother 's did , but her figure ,  | flabby and misshapen , suggested poor health . She jerked as she walked , her wrists and hands were knotted from arthritis , her back was as rounded as that of a barrel chair . Her moist , colorless lips , her half-closed eyes , the gray hair pulled tightly back from a bony forehead , contributed to the general effect of vagueness overlaid by her habitually bewildered mien . " What is it , Mother ? Do you want anything ? " She had a dull , submissive voice that suggested patience , but no interest . " Open a window , for heaven 's sake . " Her mother 's brittle tones in contrast leaped as if an electric switch had been turned . " Get some air in here . I 'm stifled . People will faint . Never mind if a little dirt does blow in , we need ventilation . " She was half-choked with coal gas , the old lady confided to Hugh as he rose to help the daughter , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tending the hot-air furnace for thirty years and had n't learned to manage the drafts yet . A constant stream of callers flowed past the couch , then , their felicitations extended , drifted into the adjoining dining room where they eddied in circles that spread into the hall . Miss Matty and two colored maids served ice cream , coffee , and cake . Hugh overheard a middle-aged matron voicing her admiration for the nonagenarian to Seneth , who did not appear to dissent . " . . . Old age is really beautiful , when you have your faculties and enough money to take care of you . And of course a devoted daughter , because you ca n't buy the kind of service Miss Matty gives her mother . Why , she 's up two or three times every night , to make sure Mrs. Reed is covered and is n't awake or in distress . If the mother ca n't sleep some nights , Miss Matty reads to her  | for hours . She washes and dresses her , just as she would a baby . Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as her mother does . I 'm sure I do n't know what Mrs. Reed would do , if Miss Matty should be taken first . " " Miss Matty 's devoted her entire life to her mother , has n't she ? " Brosia , in the car with her husband , waiting for Gillian and Seneth to make their adieux , folded her large graygloved hands quietly in her lap . Not a tendril of her hair had loosened from place , her make-up needed no repairs . As she sat gracefully upright she reminded the doctor of a grayand-blue candlestick , artistically correct , slim , permanently in good taste . No one lived forever , Hugh suggested , his eyes fixed steadily on the barbershop pole near the curb . If in the course of human events old Mrs. Reed should die , as old ladies did die , had anyone given a thought as to what Miss Matty was to do with herself ? " Say the mother lives to be one hundred , Miss Matty will be seventy-four . Do you suppose a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own at seventy-four ? " " She 'll be content . Her life has been unselfishly spent and she 'll have no regrets . " Brosia , gentle , firm , drew up the collar of her gray squirrel coat . " Why wo n't she have regrets ? " Miss Matty 's life of service and sacrifice precluded regrets , Brosia declared . " I do n't believe she 's ever been sorry she did n't marry . If she had had a husband or children , her mother could n't have remained her first thought . When her mother passes on , Miss Matty will have nothing to reproach herself for . She told me that no hand except  | her own has touched her mother , in the way of caring for her , for more than forty years . " " My God , her mother never asked her to waste her life like that . " Hugh 's eyebrow shot up savagely , he twisted at the window hook , lowering the glass in haste as if he choked for lack of air . His wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistaken viewpoint . " I do n't think a woman can choose the way she loves , dear . You never asked me to love you as I do , but I could n't love you and not give up things for you . Ca n't you understand Miss Matty 's happiness in her sacrifice ? " No , he could n't understand , he hoped to God he never would understand . Hugh leaned backward to open the rear door as Gillian and Seneth began to descend the rickety steps of the house . " What you women refuse to admit is your terrible , hidden motive  --  you 're bribing God to insure you against loss . Or trying to . " " Hugh ! " " You do n't give a damn whether your sacrifice appeals to the unfortunate upon whom you force your offering , through whom you hope to flag the attention of the Most High . Old Mrs. Reed would have rejoiced in a normal daughter who married and had children and established a home of her own . Even if a married daughter would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who knows but the old lady might have enjoyed a little neglect ? At least she could complain about it , and that 's something . " Gillian stooped to enter the car , knocked her head against the doorframe as she usually did . " Miss Matty is certainly a wonderful daughter , is n't she ? "  | " I only hope my children will be half as devoted to me , " Seneth , behind her , said . Old Mrs. Reed advanced sturdily to meet the spring but in March Orval Minnestrat died so suddenly that Gillian continued to assert piteously for weeks after the funeral that it could n't be true . Mr. Philip seemed to turn old as she watched him , as if he had hitherto used some preparation that prevented withering and now had no incentive to varnish his outer frame . He listened courteously to his nephew , Lane , Orval 's son who moved into his father 's office and was made a member of the firm . The younger man , intending to be grave and saturnine for a reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aroused by the changes he urged , soon betrayed him into cheerful briskness . But he continued to wear a black tie . He brought with him , from his own practice , his secretary ? an efficient , trained young woman whose competent management of his correspondence and clients impressed the office staff . Gillian , slightly confused , assumed that she admired Miss Snedecker , but the girls in the outer office acidly described the newcomer as a pain in the neck . They endeavored to cultivate a close formation with Gillian at the apex . Loyalty to Philip Minnestrat , whom they now designated as " old Mr. Philip , " motivated them , they declared , and they assured Gillian that if the nephew had his way the uncle would be retired . Belle Snedecker , Gillian told Cousin Leidy and Cousin Waldo , inclined toward radical ideas . Her husband 's name was George Hall . He earned an excellent income , but Belle  | intended to be a lawyer some day . She disliked housework , refused to devote herself to running a house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cousin Leidy subscribed to the conviction that every married woman , sooner or later , must have a child . Gillian fervently hoped that Miss Snedecker might " get in the family way , " as Cousin Leidy usually expressed it . ( Occasionally she referred to pregnancy as " in an interesting condition . " ) Of course , Gillian admitted , it would undoubtedly cost the young woman her well-paid position , but that was the price competent secretaries paid for the lovely experience of bearing a child . When Muriel Beams threatened to resign if she had to take orders from Miss Snedecker , Gillian advised patience . " Maybe she wo n't be here long . She 'll have a family to keep her at home . " Muriel Bcams 's reply was a derisive hoot . When Miss Snedecker had a baby , Muriel said , the heavens would fall on Gillian . " That 's how you 'll know . Let me tell you , Miss Fields , she and her husband spend every cent they both make , and they intend to keep it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a car and entertain all the time . Well , over the week-ends , anyway . Nights she goes to law school . When she passes her bar examination , they 'll be sitting pretty . " Gillian secretly believed that the alert efficiency of the new secretary distracted Mr. Philip . He hated to be pushed , his favorite philosophy was that " Tomorrow is Another Day . " Belle Snedecker liked to sort his correspondence , she persuaded him to allow her to write his letters and presented them , unerringly composed and spaced , for his trembling signature . His nephew , who wished to be kind , invented  | elaborate consultations , appealed constantly to the older man for advice . As the nephew 's right-hand assistant , Miss Snedecker took notes at these conferences , arranged the calendar schedule of each partner . Gillian , uncertain what to do , bewildered by this uncertainty , busied herself with routine typing , received clients who had no appointment , sharpened her pencils half a dozen times a day , and took the pencil sharpener apart when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outer office  --  because young Mr. Lane Minnestrat thought it a good idea to reserve his uncle 's office for quite private conferences ? Gillian reminded herself that her salary had not been reduced and that a little less responsibility might benefit her health . She would not begin to break for years , she reflected , but a stitch in time saved nine . It occurred to her to comment discreetly to Muriel Beams on the change in Mr. Wrench , the bookkeeper . " He is n't what he used to be . Any extra work , the slightest swerve in his routine , and he 's so nervous his hands begin to shake . I hope I never get like that . " But Muriel forebore to report the remarks of Mr. Wrench , who had mumbled to her the previous day that Miss Fields was beginning to show her age . " The old girl is n't what she used to be . I notice that she 's flighty . Gets things balled up . Well , we all have to face the fact that we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Lane Minnestrat 's office , included a handsome typewriter desk for Miss Snedecker . A new typewriter was delivered the next afternoon . Miss Snedecker mentioned that she was checking up on the most modern filing systems , the office must bring its records up to date .  | " My niece , Mary Cleveland , would like to study filing . " Gillian thought , it 's May , and she 's been here less than two months . She must think she 's office manager . Well , maybe she is office manager , only I do n't think Mr. Philip intends her to be . Belle Snedecker had bright , dark eyes , magnified by the glasses she wore for close work . The sculptured waves of her hair showed the attractive outline of her shapely head . Whenever she saw Miss Snedecker 's hair , Gillian began to fumble with the pins in her own hair , worked to twist loose strands into the sagging knot . Only of course I have a great deal more hair than she has , and it 's more trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it ever was and she has to have treatments because she ruins her hair with too many permanents . " Why does n't your niece go to a filing school ? " Miss Snedecker asked . Mary 's mother , Gillian explained , did n't want the girl to go into an office . " She wants to keep her a home girl . I think Mary feels she owes her mother a great deal , ? my sister has practically sacrificed her life to her children , ? so she has never tried to fit herself for office work . " " Good gracious , how archaic ! " Miss Snedecker expertly ruled two lines in red ink . Oh , Mary did n't stay at home and do nothing , Gillian hurriedly amplified . She had conducted a dress shop , had managed a tea room . " Just now she is giving lessons in diction and charm . The pupils come to her and she does n't have to leave the house . I expect she 'll build up a nice little income of her own in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ink . She said , " You 're employed in an office . "  | Well , if her mother had lived , Gillian countered vaguely , it might have been different . Now she would be the last one to advise a young girl to seek a business career , you put everything you had into a job , gave the best years of your life to it , and what was your reward ? " Just when you are ready to begin to take things a little easier , you have to worry about your future . I never thought I 'd have to worry about my future . " She swallowed as if the words left a bitter residue on her tongue . " Are you dependent on what you earn ? " Belle Snedecker 's efficiency tempted her to clip her syllables so that she slashed off words like twigs from a hedge . She had some stocks , Gillian admitted , but not many , and she never expected to be able to live on the dividends . Besides , her whole heart and soul centered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minnestrats for twenty-seven years . " " It 's when you get set in a mold that you ought to begin to worry . " Miss Snedecker removed her glasses , rubbed her eyes with a perfectly manicured slim white finger . " Have you ever thought about improving yourself ? " The older woman stared . Miss Snedecker deftly thrust the white-gold bows into the wavy locks above her ears , adjusted the glasses on her well-formed nose . " The more you can do , the better chance you have , I think . " She added that , in Gillian 's place , she would study bookkeeping . " Old Simeon Wrench wo n't last forever . They would n't go outside for a new bookkeeper if you were prepared to take over his work . " She began to print letters at the top of a sheet of foolscap . Bookkeeping ? Why , she had never thought of bookkeeping , Gillian faltered . She had never had any use for it . And when would she find time to study it ?  | " There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five nights a week . " Or you could begin in your vacation . When do you plan to take your vacation ? I 'm making out the schedule . " Why , I 've always made out the vacation schedule , Gillian thought . Why , I 'm supposed to make out the schedule ? that is , I was always supposed to . She 's pushed me right out of my own office and now she 's taking everything into her hands that she can grab . Probably she 's suggesting to Mr. Philip that Mr. Wrench is an old man . What I do n't understand is how she has so much influence . It 's what Cousin Leidy would call galling to see a woman like that ride roughshod over the office force . No wonder Muriel Beams is leaving . If I was ten years younger , I 'd leave , too . Gillian agitatedly pushed in three pins she felt protruding from her hair . She tugged at the side seams of her dark brown frock with both hands . " I said I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . " " Then I 'll put you down for the last two weeks in June . " Miss Snedecker drew a neat star under the proper dates . The last two weeks in June meant nothing to her , she always took the first two weeks in August , Gillian raved to Muriel Beams in the washroom . It was cold in June at the shore , no one went down as early as that . And if you took your vacation before the hot weather , you reached September feeling as though you 'd never had a breathing spell . " You 're the one who lets the damn fool give you orders . " Muriel stuck out her lower lip . " I only hope I exit Saturday without shooting her . " The office was bigger than Miss Snedecker , Gillian stated , but a pathetic doubt ruffled the edges of her voice . The office  | had been running a long time before Miss Snedecker came into it , presumably the office would continue to function after Miss Snedecker had gone . " She has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always have new ideas . She advised me to study bookkeeping . " Muriel , a stout girl with a round face , a snub nose and eyes that were usually pink-rimmed , snorted . " Advice ? That goddamn idiot think she 's qualified to give advice on any subject under the sun . She had the nerve to tell me that I should n't be anxious , I 'll be married sooner or later . I tell all my friends not to worry about being old maids , ' she says to me . I tell them to do as I did , not to be easily satisfied , but to shop around . ' Can you beat that for conceit ? " Muriel 's scarlet face appeared to bulge . " She shopped around ! Like hell she did . She grabbed the first man who dared show his head over the wall . Have you seen her husband ? I have . He looks like a gangster who 's learned to shave once a week . " Well , really , such language , Gillian sighed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was half . jellied from soaking in the gummy china tray . Such language ; but at least Muriel was frank . Somehow , one did n't trust Miss Snedecker , she was a little too smooth . Gillian ran the window shade up to the top , examined the mass of her hair in the direct rays of the afternoon light . She did n't know what to do with it , it was dreadfully gray and it looked rough in spite of her nightly one hundred strokes . But I wo n't have it waved , because heat ruins the texture of the hair . Maybe I 'll go back to wearing nets , women used to look so neat when they wore hair nets . Bookkeeping , she said . Maybe I could get some textbooks from the  | library . I could keep them a month on my card and go over them while I 'm at the shore . I used to have a good head for figures , there ca n't be anything so complicated about keeping a set of books . Cousin Leidy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gillian 's vacation plans to a head , that a woman who was cooped up in a house , day upon day , month after month , the year round , needed a change . " The doctor tells me he does n't see how I stand it . You do n't realize , Gillian , because you go out every day . You see different people , hear them talk . Me , I 'm shut in for weeks at a time . Specially since I do n't walk so good any more . Waldo do n't mind it so much , as long as he has his pipe and his paper he 's happy , but when I get my work done I ca n't smoke a pipe . The doctor says I need to eat somebody else 's cooking for a spell . " " Tell her to swallow a few tomato seeds instead of digging them out , and that will add a little variety to her cooking , " counseled Hugh Kent . Cousin Leidy had not consulted him on her need for change , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " The main reason I do n't take her with me , Hugh , is that I want to go to a hotel on the bay side . It 's very quiet and Cousin Leidy would n't be happy there . She likes plenty of life . " If he heard of her taking Cousin Leidy for any other purpose than to throw her off the dock , he 'd come down to the beach and feed Gillian to the sharks , the doctor glowered , pounding his fist on the desk . " For God 's sake , woman , will you go away and have a vacation like any  | other normal human being ? The heavenly spies wo n't report you to the Lord , if you take two weeks out for yourself . Give the word and I 'll mix Cousin Leidy something to make her sleep for a fortnight ; guarantee her to wake up only when you open the door on your return . What do you say ? No ? Well , then , have a good time , and say to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every way I am thinking only of myself . ' " Gillian 's first three days at the " Salty Spray " failed to relax her tension . She found it difficult to sleep , when she did she dreamed about the office . Although she assured herself she did n't believe in dreams , an uneasiness harassed her until she shut herself into the drugstore telephone booth and called the office , an extravagance which cost her seventy cents . She asked for Muriel Beams 's successor , Miss Thompson , but Miss Snedecker answered . No , there was no mix-up , no trouble of any kind , Miss Snedecker assured Miss Fields . Everything was running smoothly , they all envied Miss Fields her opportunity to enjoy the beautiful weather . Mr. Lane and Mr. Philip were both fine , thank you , so good of you to call up , but you must n't have us on your mind . The textbooks Gillian conscientiously carried to the beach in her capacious bag bewildered and alarmed her . Bookkeeping might be an exact and simple science , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge one picked up by oneself . She had been so glad to find the books thin and flat and light in weight , that she had taken eight out on her card . For three afternoons she sat on the sand , in the warm sand , her back against a bleached spar , and read . From where she sat she could see the " Salty Spray , " a  | gray-shingled barnlike structure that actually appeared to lean in whichever direction the wind blew . It was the last hotel at the end of the boardwalk and because of the absence of surrounding buildings suggested desolation , though its interior was cheerful enough . The beach on which Gillian sat was lonely , too , without bathing ropes or life guards . The sparkle and glitter of the resort flowed in the opposite direction , toward the concessions and the town . The south end , even at the height of the season , was sparsely inhabited ; in June it was a sandy waste . At five o'clock the heartening odor of frying fish , deliciously mingled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pull herself out of her hollow and turn her face to the west . A trudge over the sand dunes brought her to the narrow strip of boardwalk from which narrower strips , like silver-gray ribbons , connected the hotel with the beach . Coarse , wiry grass struggled to grow in the thin topsoil spread over the lawn before the Salty Spray , hydrangea bushes huddled in thick , damp clumps at the base of the steps . The long line of rocking chairs on the porch were empty save for a single occupant , an old man who sat passively , hands placed limply , palms down on the broad , flat arms of his chair . " How are you , Mr. Hartley ? " Gillian , her arms filled with books , her hair in amazing disorder , mounted the steps slowly as if the seven of them represented a steep climb . Mr. Hartley rumbled in his interior , shook loose a sentence . " Just tolerable . " " Such a lovely afternoon ! " Gillian passed the top step , sagged against a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she thought , even to the funny little slits for  | eyes and his hairy brown face . I think his family might do something to entertain him . " Have n't you been for a walk , Mr. Hartley ? " He could n't walk alone , the old man returned , and no one had time to take him . " Spent my life doing for others and now no one 's got any time to give me . " People just did n't think , Gillian murmured , reluctant to criticize Mr. Hartley 's married daughter and his niece , who seemed to be attentive enough , though they certainly did n't exactly hover about the old man . Week-ends his son and son-in-law came down , Mrs. Abbott , the landlady , had explained to Gillian , but they played golf from morning till night . The rocking chair creaked as Mr. Hartley swayed gently back and forth . " Got to be old , before you learn the real character of folks . Long as I was producing , I was all right . Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place for you in this world . " Gillian hoisted her bag of books , rested it on her hip . " You 'll feel better after supper , Mr. Hartley . Maybe you 're a little rundown . All this lovely fresh air and such good things to eat , ought to build you up . " She saw him in the dining room that evening , hunched over his plate , his napkin tucked under his chin . One by one the other guests at his table finished their meal and left , but his womenfolk waited patiently for him . He happened to be the only one at breakfast the next morning when Gillian went in for her coffee and toast . Her impulse was to avoid his table  --  he never had a cheerful word to say , she told herself ? but he beckoned to her . " Got your books with you , I see . You 're like me , you ca n't  | waste good daylight lying a-bed . The way folks loll on their pillows when there 's so much waiting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his mind . I been up for an hour . Thought I 'd starve , hanging around , waiting for the dining room doors to open . " Dishes surrounded him in fleets . He had spilled coffee on the napkin spread across his vest and as he helped himself to a fried egg the yolk broke and ran over the spoon on to the tablecloth . Gillian rejoiced that her own table was at the far end of the room . She marched toward it , reflecting that it was a little unreasonable in Mr. Hartley to criticize those who , while on vacation , slept late . He goes up to bed at half-past seven every night , she remembered , it 's no wonder he ca n't sleep in the morning . He 'd probably like his breakfast served at six o'clock . The freckle-faced , worried-looking waitress raced down the room and Gillian smiled . " Good morning , Clara . It 's another nice day . " Clara responded gloomily that nice weather during the week did n't count . " We 're all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crowd comes to the shore these times is over Saturday and Sunday . " She wrote down Gillian 's modest order , tore the slip from the pink pad . " Guess you 're on a diet . Not like Mr. Hartley . He 's stuffing himself with all the things his daughter wo n't let him have and they 'll probably be sending for the doctor for him before night . " No , he did n't have a weak stomach , Clara explained , but he ought to be a bit careful at his age . He did n't exercise , yet he ate like a horse . You could n't expect a man eighty-one years old to eat a dish of sliced bananas , a bowl of oatmeal with cream , three cups of coffee , two fried eggs , bacon ,  | and a plate of griddle cakes , and not pay for it , could you ? " He gets fighting mad if his daughter tries to cut down his intake , but when he 's sick she 's the one who has to nurse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating prunes , Clara reported ) until Gillian had finished her meal . She had hoped he would take himself off and leave her to the solitary enjoyment of the barnlike room that was saved from drabness only by the deeply recessed windows which faced the sea . Limp net curtains swayed in the breeze , sunshine poured in across the tables , washed the peacock-blue plastered walls . Gillian thought , I 'm glad it 's sunny , I hate to be cooped up in a resort hotel . I 'm having a nice vacation ? that is , I 'm having a good rest . I might call up the office today and ask about the mail . If there should be a personal letter for me , Miss Snedecker would n't bother to forward it . She goes to lunch at one ? I 'll walk up town to the drugstore and put in a call about quarter-past one . " You going to the beach ? " Mr. Hartley 's little eyes rolled like beans in their narrow slits , as she passed his table . Clara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back door , but Gillian had refused this offer as faintly undignified . Now she wished she had accepted , for she must turn and answer politely . " I have to study . I 'm taking up bookkeeping , you know . " She patted the bulging sides of her striped bag . If she did n't mind , he 'd walk a piece with her , Mr. Hartley suggested . Do him good to get down to the sand and bake his old bones . " I 'm all right , spry as I ever was , except now and then my legs give out . Elsie do n't like me to go round alone , on account she 's afraid I may have a fall . " He pulled  | himself out of his chair , his folded newspaper tumbling from his pocket to the floor . Gillian picked up the scattered pages , waited patiently in the hall outside the dining room while the old man fumbled for his hat and cane which he had left in the wire rack . He met the suggestion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satirical observation that she never missed him ; but he carefully informed Mrs. Abbott , behind the desk , that lie was going for a walk . When he was finally ready to start , Gillian discovered that he tottered to such a harrowing degree that she could steady him only by putting her arm through his . He leaned on her so heavily that every muscle in her body ached from tension before they reached the beach , and when she saw him drop to the sand she had a moment of acute doubt as to her ability ever to haul him again to his feet . But when she tucked her rug around his shoulders ? for the June breeze had in it the coldness of the silent , cold depths of the ocean ? he smiled with such childlike appreciation of physical comfort that she decided she must be glad lie had come . She hoped that he would sleep or read his paper ; but she did not really expect him to show such consideration , she told herself , as the old voice babbled hour after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Hartley advised , the more you knew the less your employers valued you . " I give my firm the best years of my life , and what happens ? They toss me out like an old shoe , soon as they 've got the good out of me . There 's no place for an old feller in business , even if his brain 's as good as ever ' t was . " The attitude of his family , Mr. Hartley complained , reflected that of his firm . " Ai n't got no use for the old man ,  | no respect for him . Never ask my advice , never want to take me anywhere with them . I see my son and son-in-law making ducks and drakes out of their business , but would they listen to me if I told them how to stop the leaks ? No ? Pop 's out of date , Pop 's a has-been . " He continued to lament until the chewing-gum-factory whistle over in the town shrieked noon . Then , with Gillian 's assistance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She pulled his hat down over his eyes to protect them from the glaring sun , turned up the collar of his coat against the steady , driving wind . The return walk exhausted Gillian , for Mr. Hartley declared his knees hurt and he made terrible work of getting over the sand dunes . She had her books to carry and the heavy rug . Her hair sagged miserably , her shoes felt stuffed with sand . She resented the bovine stare of the few boarders who sat placidly in their rocking chairs and watched her pilot the old man up the porch steps and into the foyer . After that , to her bewilderment , everyone ? including Mr. Hartley and his family ? blandly assumed that she found the old man excellent company . His daughter and niece declared they felt him to be in good hands when with Gillian , and they felt free to relax , which meant making the rounds of the amusements at the other end of town . His fellow boarders slid easily past his table , or his chair on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone take a little interest in the aged . " We 're all coming to it sooner or later , hope someone will be willing to listen to me in my dotage , " they said , gathering up their golfsticks or their bathing togs or their magazines , and fleeing from the scene before Mr. Hartley 's trembling hand should be laid upon  | their arms or his querulous voice interrogate them as to their plans for the day . Mrs. Abbott , the landlady , met Gillian in the upstairs hall one noon , just as she had returned from the beach . Grave , serene , capable , Mrs. Abbott ? always in freshly ironed orchid or yellow linen dresses of uniform simplicity ? radiated strength and calm . " What do you get yourself all tired out for ? " the landlady demanded , looking not at Gillian but at her tumbled hair . No one had ever seen Mrs. Abbott 's iron-gray hair not perfectly marcelled and beautifully neat . Gillian turned the key in her door , staggered over the threshold to the bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor . " I 'm dead ! Mr. Hartley means all right , but lie wo n't amuse himself for a minute . He has to talk and he wants somebody to answer him . It never occurs to him that I might like to read or to take a walk along the beach . I ca n't even write a letter when he is sitting there , because lie wo n't keep still long enough for me to think what I want to say . " " You came down here for a rest  --  no reason why you should wear yourself out toting him around . " Mrs. Abbott 's broad figure in the doorway amply filled it . She might be foolish , but she felt sorry for the old man , Gillian insisted , he was so much alone and his family were n't any too kind to him . " He feels hurt , the way his firm treated him , too . I can understand that . Anyone who 's been to business knows that employers can be frightfully unjust . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Fields , you do n't want to believe every word Mr. Hartley tells you . Take him with a grain of salt . They been coming  | here for years and I know ' em real well . I suppose he 's been telling you how mean his firm was to him , tossed him right out after he gave them the best years of his life ? Yes , I thought so . I guess he kind of forgot to tell you they tossed him out with a pension . He gets seventy-five dollars a month as long as he lives . And his daughter gives him his home and never touches a cent of his money . She 's paying for his vacation down here . " Mr. Hartley , Mrs. Abbott continued , had been " hard " on his children , so it was not to be expected that they would crave his society . " He opposed this daughter 's marriage , said dreadful things about her husband ; but I notice he was glad enough to go and live with them . He raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study architecture . The old man planned for him to go to work as soon as he finished high school . No , Miss Fields , Timothy Hartley has n't been used mean ? we get out of life what we put into it . Every time . I believe that as much as though I 'd seen it printed in the Bible . " Suppose we do get out of life what we put into it , thought Gillian , sitting up in bed late that night and reaching for her dressing gown . She thrust her feet into her moccasin slippers , groped her way through the dim grayness to the window . Awake for hours , the dull roar of the sea irritated rather than soothed her . She sat down by the window and the cool , damp air flowed softly over her . The breakers pounded on the beach in a rhythm she could almost have timed ; between each crash of the waters she heard the rapid , fragile ticking of her traveling clock . What have I put into life ? she thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take an awful cold , but some people  | say you do n't catch cold in the salt air . What have I put into life ? Have I done anything for others ? Perhaps for Cousin Leidy and Cousin Waldo . Only I 've not always been as patient as I should be . The way Cousin Waldo rattles his newspapers drives me right out of my mind . Mercy , that was a big one , I guess it shook the old pier . Here I am having a nice vacation and so many people ca n't get away from their work , even for a day . Of course I 'm a little lonely , I wo n't deny that . There 's a light , it must be a ship out at sea . I 'd like to be on a ship , only of course I 'd like to be able to step ashore when I liked . The window sill is wet , I must n't leave my shoes too close . Yesterday morning they felt real damp when I put them on . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The moon must be behind a cloud . What we put into it ? well , it would n't hurt anyone to think a little about that , would it ? Suppose Minnestrat and Minnestrat discharged me . That 's a silly idea , I 've been there so long and never had any thoughts of leaving them , but suppose they did discharge me . I 'd like to have pleasant thoughts . Not be like Mr. Hartley . He thought only of himself , Mrs. Abbott says . A door somewhere down the corridor closed , someone in the next room moved a chair . Gillian pictured the guests neatly arranged in their beds ; all very straight and pointed figures , decorously covered to their chins with blankets and sheets . Old Mr. Hartley , cocoon-wrapped , in his bed , his daughter and niece sleeping side by side in one bed in the room next to his . Husbands and wives , something like stalks of asparagus in Gillian 's fancy , placed peacefully on Mrs. Abbott 's good mattresses , lulled by the ceaseless dull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank of clouds , through which sliced a silver edge of the moon like the rim of a huge silver dollar , there must be God . Gillian still found it easiest to think of God as an old man with a white beard who took a fervent and piercing interest in his ledgers . Someone , probably trained angels , had the record of every human soul neatly copied into thick volumes which they opened for God 's inspection at a word from Him . Gillian visioned the double entries ? on this side what you gave up , the sacrifices you made ; on that side the list of benefits you asked from God . The moon rolled out from under the cloud and changed from a silver dollar into a pale gilt melon from which a sliver had been cut . The vast , dark expanse of ocean seemed to spread out over the face of the earth and a narrow path of shimmering , beaten metal had been laid down beyond the line of breakers that hammered on the shore . If God ever walked on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that smooth , undulating dark floor which touched Heaven at the rim of the world and follow that gleaming path , an old man with a long white beard , dressed in white robes . If we get out of life what we put into it ? thought Gillian , bending down to feel her ankles which were chilled . I 'll do anything you want me to do , God , if you 'll only save my job for me . I have to work at the office . Mr. Wrench wo n't care so much , he has a house and a garden and a grandchild , but I have n't anything of my own . But children are no guarantee of companionship , because look at Mr. Hartley . And Seneth ? her children are breaking her heart , they actually are , they do n't seem willing to do anything she asks them to do . I wish I could paint . I 'd love to do a painting of  | moonlight on the sea . Who was that woman artist Brosia gave a reception for ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot into life , but she does n't get so much out , only of course she has Hugh . He never enjoys going to Mrs. Tracy 's with her , though , and music and painting and the ? the arts do n't seem to interest him at all . He wo n't go to church with her , either . I 'm going to church this Sunday morning , even if it is vacation . My goodness , that woman in the next room has a terrible snore . Or maybe it 's her husband . There , she woke him up . I heard him swear . Gillian yawned , smoothed the long braids of her hair , which she fancied felt wet . She stood up as if her knee hinges had accumulated rust . I wo n't get up early and sneak down to the beach before Mr. Hartley gets to the dining room . I 'll wait for biro . Poor old man , he 's lonely , this is the only chance I 'll have to be kind to him . I shall pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show let me ? let me ? Heavens , I 'm nearly dead for sleep . She groped her way to the bed , stepped out of her slippers and dressing gown . There 's my bookkeeping . She lay flat in bed , pulled the sheet over her , punched the pillow into a thick mound . I must n't think too much of getting ahead , after all there 's something in the world beside material success . I must keep my job , but I guess showing a little consideration for Mr. Hartley wo n't affect my chance of success . Staring at the ceiling shadows , Gillian saw herself as she must look to God : a patiently sweet woman , helping a worn old man down to the beach , amusing him through hours of drenching sunlight , helping him back to the safe haven of his chair on the hotel porch . But was this enough to ? well , not exactly to placate God , but to convince Him that more  | than anything else in the world she wanted to keep her job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sacrifice must be something that should catch His eye the instant her recording angel opened to her page . Gillian fell asleep musing on what else she might do to please God . In the morning while she was brushing her hair , which in the sea air persistently uncoiled from the knots into which she fashioned it , no matter how many dozens of hairpins she used , Gillian knew . The thought came to her so suddenly that she faltered open-mouthed , staring at herself in the glass . Cousin Leidy ! Cousin Leidy , who wanted a change , who doted on making the rounds of the shore concessions day after day , night after night . Almost a week of vacation remained to Gillian , she must wire Cousin Leidy to share her room . What did it matter if she , Gillian , loathed the auction sales and the shrieking tinny programs of the afternoon band concerts ? Suppose she did fall asleep in her rickety gilt chair , watching the young people dancing on the pier ? Cousin Leidy adored all these things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sly fortunetellers whose silly jokes were only a little less dreadful than their glib talk of money and wills and a journey with a happy ending . God went away somewhere in the morning , the air was brilliant with sunshine , the tide was out and breakers no longer pounded on the beach . But Gillian knew exactly what she intended to do . She composed the telegram to Cousin Leidy while she cleaned her white shoes . She would n't give another thought to her personal anxieties , she 'd simply do what she could to make Cousin Leidy happy . Yes and of course Mr. Hartley , too . She must n't neglect him , perhaps  | they could take him to the beach mornings , though Cousin Leidy always swore bugs bit her when she sat in the sand . Gillian put on her shoes , tied the laces in a hard , neat bow . I 'd ask Cousin Waldo for over the week-end , if I thought I could afford it . He and Mr. Hartley might take to each other . She glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to breakfast . A trim pile of serviceably bound dark red volumes rested on a golden-oak table against the wall . I might as well put those library books back in my trunk , thought Gillian ; they 'll be safe there .  | ARE YOU sure there is n't a draft on your back , Gillian ? This room 's hard to ventilate and I 'm afraid you 'd rather take cold than ask for the screen . Shall I move the screen over there , behind you ? Well , all right , if you say so . No , I want you to sit in my place , because the light is more subdued . I know the oculist warned you to avoid a strong glare . You 're sure you can eat spinach souffle ? If you loathe it , I 'll get you something else . I try to have two vegetables for every meal and it 's a little difficult to plan a variety , but I remember you never cared much for spinach . Is my chair too high for you ? I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am . Well , now , tell me all about yourself ? Hugh grumbled terribly about your vacation , said you spent it as usual , bribing God . " Brosia glanced at Gillian across a luncheon table set with exquisite care . Linen , glass , silver , flowers and candles ? Brosia hovered over these details daily , her color scheme engrossed her whether she had one sister as guest or the entire membership of her bridge club . Gillian , who had lost weight , said conventionally , " I had a lovely vacation . How is Hugh ? " " I would n't criticize him for worlds , but one reason I urge him to go with me to Mrs. Tracy 's so much is that he does n't have an opportunity to injure himself when we are there . " Brosia tasted her fruit cup .  | Gillian hesitated . " Injure himself ? You mean Hugh is apt to make his leg worse or something ? " She did n't refer to physical injury , Brosia murmured , folding back the embroidered case that held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Hugh is n't always himself lately . I do n't think it can be called a habit yet , but the ? the tendency seems to grow on him . " She means his drinking , Gillian thought , her eyes fixed on her spoon . Of course Frank used to drink more than was good for him , when he went to dinners , but that was before Prohibition and Sencth never made much fuss . She used to sleep in the guest room . Rhodes told me that a patient sometimes brings I lugh beer and that if Brosia smells it on his breath she thinks he 's intoxicated . Rhodes has n't much patience with any of us . " I thought : perhaps Hugh would be here for lunch , because it 's Saturday . " Gillian stepped on the buzzer , hastily removed her foot . Drat that bell , I did n't want to sit in Brosia 's chair in the first place . The maid pushed open the door , Brosia said , " No , Konta , " and to Gillian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's in the country . Staying till Sunday night . " " The same place ? " Brosia nodded . This was really a final visit for the season , she explained . Hugh probably would n't go up again till the next spring . " He realizes I 'm a little nervous after my accident and he would n't have gone today , except that he promised to look at some throat case . The environment is all wrong , I think he admits that . It 's so fatally easy to forget all the amenities , the people are almost primitive . " Konta removed the plates , served the salad which looked  | like a pond lily on a rose-colored glass lake . Mrs. Kent 's the only lady I ever worked for who 's got to have four courses for lunch , the maid reflected sullenly , but there 's only two in the family and they pay good . Besides , I like to work for a doctor , there 's lots of free samples . The telephone rang , Konta announced that Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm so sorry , do you mind ? I 'll have to talk to her , she 's the chairman for our underprivileged boys ' dance committee . I would n't let anyone else interrupt us , but Mrs. Stenning holds office in the National Federation and she 's in the city only once a week . You 'll forgive me , wo n't you ? I 'll be just as brief as I can . " Brosia hastened noiselessly up the stairs to the extension where she had left her list of ticket-holders ' names . After all , she 's my own sister , it seems rather silly to ask my pardon for answering a phone call . Gillian , left alone , realized that the cream-and-blue dining room was as formal and as correct as Brosia , who had such a horror of committing a faux pas . The house had been done over that summer , the dining room walls were deep ivory , new full-length draperies of dull blue outlined the four windows . A new blue rug set off the Sheraton set which Brosia had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be making money , even if he does drink , Gillian thought . They have a new car , too . Cousin Leidy says Seneth told her Hugh is paying back the money to Brosia that she spent on his medical education . Seneth thinks she ought to save it , but Brosia wants things for her house . Things ! Brosia 's whole life was crammed with things . Gillian wondered , as she had wondered a thousand times  | before , how any woman could be so absorbed in details as Brosia had been for years . She still made rites of the seasonal changes , ordered her correspondence papers in four shades , took down and replaced her curtains four times a year . Her linen closet displayed piles of sheets , pillow cases , towels , each pile banded and labeled as to size , room assigned , and date of purchase . She delighted in accumulating dinner cloths , napkins , luncheon sets , breakfast sets . The perfection of her housekeeping , the exquisite order , the carefully planned meals , her constant and lavish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coveted , too , her gift of always appearing to be charmingly dressed , well-groomed , and never in haste . But she was no " Craig 's Wife , " these women asserted loyally , triumphantly . Brosia Kent put her husband 's interests above her own . " That man gets better care than any man outside a real , first-class hotel ever gets , " Cousin Leidy , in one of the long periods of waiting for the afternoon auction to open at the shore , had confided to Gillian . " Why , Brosia told me once that , from the day they was married , he 's had a complete clean outfit , socks , underwear , shirt , handkerchief , ready winter and summer for him when he wakes up . Funny thing , though , he wo n't let Brosia buy him as much as a single shirt . He 's kind of hipped on the subject of a man buying his own clothes ? anything she does buy him , he sends right back . " It was Cousin Leidy 's opinion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Gillian 's vacation , had given Hugh a much-needed jolt . " He ships her up to Seneth 's while he goes to stay with some country doctor , and the two of them probably are up to no good . I must say that 's a nice  | reward for a wife who 's done everything for him . Then what 's he to do ? He stays , pays no attention to Brosia , pays no attention to his practice . When she fell down the stairs it was because she tripped on a blanket she was taking down to wash and mend and send up to him . In case he did n't have enough bedding in his crazy shack . " Cousin Leidy had added that she was sure Hugh slept with a mess of dogs on top of him . " Seems like he 'd rather cure dogs than people . After all Brosia 's done for him , too . " At the top of the stairs Brosia 's voice began , an indistinct murmur resolving into words as she descended , crossed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to talk over , I had to read my list to her and check with her on her list of names . Why did n't you go ahead without me ? You must be starved . And your tea is cold . Yes it is , do n't try to drink it . Press the buzzer for Konta . But first I 'll move the screen so that if there should be a draft from that window it wo n't strike your back . " " Brosia , " said Seneth , who was knitting a baby 's jacket in pink wool , " have you ever thought of adopting a child ? " Her sister , sunk in the depths of an overstuffed chair , shook her head . " Mercy , no . " " You 're not likely to have any of your own , now . " " No . " The early November snow which banked the sills of the windows in Seneth 's living room deadened the noises in the street , heightened the cheerful effect of the grate fire . Seneth 's children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mother to put in an oil burner or one of the new gas heaters . Seneth insisted that she preferred hot-air heat ,  | besides they had never had as few colds in their lives as during that winter when everyone had had to conserve fuel . A cool house was better for the health . Not that the children ever stayed at home these days , to know whether the old furnace was adequate or not . With Lettice in her own flat and Rhodes married and living with Catherine 's parents , you might say I have only two children left , Seneth mourned . She looped the wool about her wrist , began a new row . Brosia asked , " Is that for the church fair ? " For Lettice , Seneth explained . " She 's invited to a shower , a stork shower they call it , for that Davis girl who married that Marshall boy last year . Lettice ca n't knit a stitch and I promised to help her out . A baby can use any number of jackets , so if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh . " Brosia stared at the collection of framed photographs which filled half the side wall above Seneth 's head . Pictures of Scnctli 's children from babyhood to the present day  --  for years Seneth had given pictures of her children as Christmas presents to the family connections , Brosia recollected . She said aloud , " I wonder how Hugh would feel about adopting a child . " He 'd oppose it at first , men usually did , Seneth assured her . But , the idea presented to him , he 'd mull it over , gradually yield . " I think you both need something to work for , you have a lovely home , but , after all , your lives are empty if you live just for yourselves . " Seneth at fifty retained her beautiful voice , her delightful enunciation , unhurried , clear . " Mrs. Tracy is on the Board of Managers of the Saint Agnes Creche . " Brosia saw that her hands , clasped about  | her knees , were red . She held them up , flexing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them white . It will be hard , adjusting our ways to a child , but I suppose we ought to do it , she thought . Most of the training and responsibility will fall upon me , it would if we had children of our own . With my feeling for color and form , I could design a perfectly marvelous child 's room . I do n't think Seneth has ever paid sufficient attention to providing the right color in her children 's background . " I suppose you 'll be a grandmother , one of these days , " Brosia observed . She had no hope , though there was nothing she would welcome more , Seneth disclosed , her fine steel needles moving with almost the precision of a machine . No , she did n't dare hope for grandchildren , not with Rhodes and Catherine so wrapped up in their material advancement , though you 'd think with her religion Catherine would have a baby right away . " I 'm positive her mother expects her to have a baby as soon as they 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ; Rhodes wants his own home first and before they buy a house they plan a trip abroad . It is n't right , people should n't marry if they 're not ready to accept their responsibilities . I do n't think Rhodes intended to marry for years to come , but Catherine and her family pushed him into it . A girl who really loved him would have been willing to wait . " She could n't bear to visit Rhodes , Seneth added , he was so completely submerged in his wife 's circle . " Catherine has been babied to death and the whole household revolves around her . Her mother does everything for her and Rhodes gets along as best he can . He wo n't complain , but I can see he is unhappy . They tell me it is only till spring and then they 'll have enough saved  | for either the trip or a down payment on a house . Catherine keeps her business position till then . " Lettice , Seneth went on , frankly intended never to have children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discuss the subject in my house . To hear her , you 'd think I was a monster instead of a mother and she tells Whitey his mother was n't fit to bring up a cat . " Seneth 's needles wove a steady pattern , but her gaze swung to the photographs of Mary and Christopher in a leather folding frame on her desk . " There 's Mary , she may marry of course , but Kit talks of taking a vow of celibacy . At his age . Still , it 's a comfort in a way to know that in this money-mad world the spiritual values appeal to at least one young man . Kit wo n't be sixteen till February , but he seems far older because he has such mature interests . " She had n't been able to persuade Hugh to attend church for months , Brosia confessed , slipping her arms into the squirrel-lined coat which she had draped over the back of her chair . " It 's embarrassing when we go to Mrs. Tracy 's , because she insists everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday . I tell Hugh that even if he does n't believe in a creed , the outward observance wo n't compromise him . Besides , the best kind of people go to church , it 's a community bulwark . " Seneth put her work into a chintz bag , rose from her chair . Her dark green silk dress had ridden up on her wide hips , she pulled it smooth . In the mirror over the mantel she noticed straggling ends dangling from the thin knot of her hair . She would be compelled to wear a switch or a transformation , if her hair did n't stop falling out . Well , I 've put myself into my children , Brosia has never created a child .  | But I think her skin is beginning to go dry , in spite of the facials she has every week . " You 'll have to be very tactful with Hugh , perhaps you 'd better not say I suggested the plan to adopt a baby , " Seneth said . It irritated Brosia to discover that the consent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child . She had an independent income , she assured the matron at the creche , the care of the child would be her concern , it was her house . In time she expected her husband to adjust himself to the presence of a baby , but it was useless to count on his immediate co-operation . He refused to look at children offered for adoption , though it could hardly be because he disliked children . " Before he specialized in nose and throat , he was very successful with youngsters . One of his professors told me he should have been a pediatrician . " No , there was no friction between her husband and herself , it was only that she felt their marriage would have a richer meaning if they turned their thoughts to a third person . " My marriage is perfectly happy , but of course I work to keep it that way . I feel that a woman can make a success of almost any marriage , the secret of all successful living is sacrifice . If we take a little child into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selfish and set in a groove . " Brosia smiled , kneeling in her expensive black silk velvet frock on the nursery floor . The sunshine poured over her through the glass partition , a dozen children surrounded her in a ring . She knew she looked young and lovely to them , that they admired her clothes , her smooth skin , her expertly waved hair under her close-fitting hat . As a friend of Mrs. Tracy 's she had attended  | the creche meetings , had patronized the cake sales and bazaars held to raise money for the home . Elderly , charitableminded women supported the organization , their smart gay young daughters and granddaughters , banded into an auxiliary , planned the card parties and dances and teas that helped swell the funds . Brosia knew , from studying these young girls , how to approach the children , exactly the right things to say to hold their interest . The babies expected visitors to fuss over them , they were accustomed to seeing beautifully gowned women sit down on the floor to play their games . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no one missed them . Good , square , militant Mrs. Cook , the matron , remained as a rock which did not move . She supplied food , clothes , and spankings seven days a week . Even on rainy days , when no visitors came , she was always there . They 're really very sweet , thought Brosia , discovering that she could forget the bread and milk smell . The vitality of the small , warm bodies amazed her ? their cheeks were as red as poppies , just from bouncing about . Their small , clutching hands , their shining eyes , the perspiration curls that covered their damp foreheads , impressed her because she perceived these to be the outward signs of their terrific preoccupation with life . They take everything so hard , the darlings , she reflected ; they work themselves into a lather , trying to fit a ball into a box . That fat child will certainly bite his tongue off before he ever gets all those pegs into the right holes . It is n't just to interest Hugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her mind , it seemed to her , always split in two , one section permitting her to follow her sincere evaluations , the other affording her background for the superficialities ? beautiful , perhaps , correct , but unimportant ?  | from which she could never wholly separate herself . She realized when she put her arms around the sturdy , dark-eyed Paul , absorbed in the effort to tear the cover from his soft red ball , that something real within her responded to the pressure of that pliant , soft body against her breast ; but equally clear to her was the picture she made , a slender , gentle-mannered woman in a pool of sunshine , ringed around by tossing , swaying children , their faces turned to receive her smile . " I 'll speak to my husband again , " Brosia said . On the question of adoption Hugh Kent was adamant , stubborn as a mule , he admitted , and , Brosia hinted , not much more communicative . " No kids . " He had formed the habit of staying in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brosia had gone there to find him . " No kids . No pups . That 's final . " His wife , whose Christmas gift of a pedigreed puppy had been refused , was patient . " Why ? " " Too much trouble . Babies have to be waited upon . Dogs mess up the house . Both spot pink rugs . " " Hugh dear , I 've told you that I want you to have a dog , that I do n't care what he does to the house as long as he makes you happy . As for a baby ; well , any woman expects to have to wait on a baby . I 'll not mind that . " Hugh kept his gaze on the medical journal spread open on his desk . " I 'm thinking of the child , not of you . " Well , then a child needed a home , did n't it ? Brosia countered . All authorities agreed that an institution could n't compete with the advantages of the individual home . " If you 're thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " We 're a thousand miles apart now , let the welfare question  | go . " The doctor picked up a scalpel , began to cut an article from the printed page . " It 's a dirty trick to play on you , Brosia , this requiring the husband 's consent to the adoption of a child . Up till now I have n't been a drag on you , have I ? Do you suppose a divorced woman would be allowed to adopt a child ? " Brosia , in one of the crimson leather chairs she had purchased when she had the office done over ( though all her friends said she had really done most of the work and the interior decorator from Bryce had urged her to go into business for herself ) , ignored this remark as in bad taste . " But , dear , I do n't understand . Do n't you ever feel that it would be good for us , for both of us , to be jolted out of our happy , serene , but perhaps too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , compel us to sacrifice our comfortable leisure . Sometimes I think we do n't have it hard enough . " He jerked his glance up from his magazine at that , his left eyebrow knotted into the familiar quizzical design . He said nothing and in a moment his gaze dropped to the pages , which he did not turn . " Seneth 's a happy woman , though she 's never had much time for herself , her whole life has been sacrificed to her children ? " The doctor said without lifting his eyes , " For God 's sake , Brosia , be a little more accurate . Seneth is not a happy woman , and her life has been a series of weak , wasteful and useless sacrifices that may have scarred her children for the duration of their lives . " " Do n't you believe in sacrifice at all , dear ? " We always come round to this , Brosia thought , but his cynical self is n't his real nature . I 'm sure every man in his heart admires   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
