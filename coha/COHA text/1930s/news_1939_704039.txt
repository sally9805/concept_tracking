txt King George and Queen Elizabeth arrived today at 11:15 a. m . E. D. T. aboard the destroyer Warrington . A mighty welcoming salute arose from the largest city in the Western World . Just before 9 a. m . ( E. S. T. ) the City fire boat Firefighter , its brass nozzles agleam , pulled out from Battery Park to meet the destroyer Warrington . Aloft lazed several blimps and half a dozen airplanes . In the bay , a dozen pleasure craft put out to meet the Warrington . The Staten Island Ferryboats were crowded with those who hoped to see the royal vessel as it pulled into the pier . The windows of surrounding tall office buildings were filled with the heads of eager men and women . Meanwhile , down at the Battery , Mayor La Guardia. got a hand as he arrived , swinging an unaccustomed high silk hat . The combined Fire and Police Department bands played " The Governor 's March " as Gov . Herbert H. Lehman arrived .

The Queen was on the starboard side of the bridge , waving her handkerchief . The King was standing beside her , addressing remarks , from time to time , to a naval officer at his other side .

Canhain Staff Corr , cnorld , P t of The Christian Science lifonitor WITH ROYAL PARTY IN NEW YORK , June ** from their official round of visits in Washington , King George and Queen Elizabeth today saw some sights in their last official day in the United States .

And so at this point in the ? isit , a bit of its significance may be summarized . The royal tour in the United States has evoked , all along the way , only the warmest of welcomes and the friendliest of greetings . Crowds have been tremendous and smiling . Here in Manhattan it was not a triumphal welcome of the mad ' twenties style , and much of the route was planned along highways where crowds can not gather , but all the same it was a strikingly hearty reception . Results of Trip Thus the first result of the trip may be set down as the friendly , interested , good-neighborly tecepbon of the American people represented by those along the way and by those millions mote who follow the tour through newspapers and radio . A pleasant chord of hospitable greeting has been struck . Second , perhaps , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personally . All along the way , people have spoken of their unfailingly amiable manner under often most trying circumstances . These are somewhat intangible consequences . They are , however , the surface signs . of more fundamental currents : currents which reveal the parallel thinking in many respects of the British and American peoples signalized and recalled by this visit . The royal couple 's second day in Washington was another episode of mixed formality and informality . On the solemn side , King George paid tribute to two great American heroes : to George Washington at his shady , small , mellow old tomb at Mount Vernon ; to the Unknown Soldier in his magnificent mausoleum on Arlington ridge . Scene at Mount Vernon The scene at Mount Vernon was fraught with deep significance for the historically-minded observer . Landing down at the Potomac 's bank , King George and Queen Elizabeth slowly strolled up the hill , under leafy walks , until they came to the crumbly brick tomb . A small group was already gathered , mostly members of the official party . President and Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside the tomb . King George took a beautiful wreath of white flowers from an aide , and with extreme gravity stepped inside the tomb . He laid the wreath on the right-hand sarcophagus , that of Washington , and stood a moment in silent , serious meditation . Then he stepped outside , rejoined the Queen and the Roosevelts , and all four stood for another quiet pause . In that little moment , flashes of Anglo-American history may well have run through their minds , as they did through those of many bystanders . Good Will Expressed At last a British monarch had come to lay his wreath on the tomb of the man who led the Revolution . That it is 1939 , however , was not of great significance . Already in 1860 , the Prince of Wales who became Edward VII had planted an English yew tree beside the Washington tomb , and in 1924 the other Prince of Wales who became Edward VIII replaced it with another English yew , still growing flourishingly . But these two Princes were not sovereigns as they came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but on this day the very sovereign gave it appropriate expression . It was not to an old opponent , but to a valued ally that the King next paid tribute , when he laid his wreath on the tomb of the Unknown Soldier . This scene , lacking the quiet simplicity of the leafy dell where lie the Washington remains , was formal and rather military . A 21-gun salute boomed out at the foot of the hill , a band played . The wreath was handed up by a kilted Sergeant of the Royal Highlanders of Canada . Nonetheless , memory of Britain and America 's strenuous co-operation in that great war upon which such hopes were plumed stood out in this ceremony , and in that at the Canadian Cross . Finally , in the evening came the last of a round of dinners which were inevitable , but certainly not sprightly . The King and Queen , as hosts at the British Embassy , returned President and Mrs. Roosevelt 's dinner of the night before , with a strictly official gathering of 36 persons .

This touching function soon concluded , they dashed to Capitol Hill , and in exactly 21 minutes shook hands charmingly with all the members of Congress who presented themselves , over 400 of them . Congress , it was easy to see , was delighted to act as hosts to royalty ; the legislative branch of the American Government did the honors with dispatch and courtesy . The King and Queen stood on a small carpet , before them filed first the members of the Senate , introduced individually by Sena , for Key Pittman , President ProTern ; and then came the House 1 members , introduced by Representative Sol Bloom . The House , as usual , skylarked a bit as they , waited . It was a grand affair , al- ; though a pretty solid bit of hand , shaking for the King and Queen . but they performed their task with complete virtuosity . Dash to Potomac Next the party dashed to the yacht Potomac. and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate grounds was one of the most informal of the whole trip . Few persons were within , the King and Queen , a few officials , and the press had the place to themselves for a good walk in the sunshine , and a look around the charming old house . The Queen expressed her delight at the simple , mellow old pieces of furniture , at the gardens , and at the outlook over the wide Potomac estuary , and the King enjoyed stretching his legs even if the sun was too hot for real comfort . Field Day for Press Anci the press : Well , it was a ' . photographer 's field day . The British cameramen had rarely seen anything like it , they said afterward . At first they looked somewhat aghast at the uninhibited antics of their American colleagues ? none of %%hem , of course , addressed the royal couple or did anything really disrespectful .

Surprise Party One of the surprises of the royal visit was the inclusion of the King in Mrs. Roosevelt 's party for the Queen and the Washington newspaper women who regularly cover her conferences .

That Quiz Party The next informal note of tile day was the White House tea , ' which turned into a party under the trees , and at which well-informed but not necessarily h.gh- ranking officials and personages were present . William Green , head of the American Federation of Labor , was one of the guests and told the King of present business and unemployment statistics . Fechner , head of the CCC , filled in details . The King , t. ? 1 wanted to 1 ? -. now about this labor-camp system . Miss Frances Perkins , Seeretai y of Labor . Miss Katherine Lenroot .

The President was taking the King around and showing hint whei e he works ! And on that note of friendliness , the White House part of the visit virtually ended . It is typical of the atmosphere that has prevailed , and that was to be resumed in different surroundings at Hyde Park House .
