Out of 57 WPAsters wielding picks &; shovels on a ditch-digging project in New York City 's Bronx , 38 walked off the job one day last week and refused to labor more . Their reason : working with either pick or shovel was hard enough , but to ask any man to use these tools interchangeably ( i.e. , without a chance to rest while another worker plied the other tool ) was " inhuman . " Result : one man discharged , one suspended , interchangeable picking &; shoveling resumed .
