txt  | where a beam of light is going he studies its wave properties ; to find how energetic it is , he measures its photons . In 1913 a Danish physicist , Dr. Nils Bohr , developed a new theory of the structure of the atom which explained much about how atoms and molecules emit radiation . Physicists knew that the simplest atom was that of hydrogen , consisting of a proton and an electron ; Bohr found that by making certain assumptions he could predict , not roughly , but to closer than one-tenth of one per cent , the lengths of the waves of light which a hydrogen atom would emit when an electron bumped into it . Not only did his calculations predict light of wavelengths which had already been observed , but some new waves in parts of the spectrum which had not yet been studied were predicted , and when looked for , these were immediately found . The essentials of the Bohr picture , which in qualitative form apply to any atom , are that a photon of light is emitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displaced to another orbit from the orbit in which it normally wheels around the atomic nucleus . In returning to its original orbit the electron must give up energy , and this energy is radiated as a photon of light . The wavelength of the light emitted , and hence its color , will depend entirely on how much energy is involved in the transition from one orbit to another . Thus to predict what colors of light various atoms will emit , one need only determine the energy content of the various electron orbits in the atom . This spectroscopists have been doing for some years , so that for the most important atoms the energy levels are well known . By firing electrons from a hot filament into a vapor , light can be produced very efficiently ; for when an electron bumps into an atom it will disarrange the electrons of which this is  | composed and give it the required extra energy to produce a photon . ' When atoms are packed close together , as in a solid or liquid , the electron orbits get jumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause the atoms to emit light is to shake them all with heat ; but this involves loss of control of the colors emitted . When atoms are in the vapor form , then , shooting at them with electrons will cause light to be emitted with very little wasted energy . The most efficient lamps of the future should be vapor lamps , and for special purposes such lamps are now coming into wide use . The physicist is not groping in the dark in his search for better light sources . lie already knows how to produce fairly cold light , and he is beginning to do so in a big way with his new sodium and mercury lamps . The papers on light production written by modern illuminating engineers and applied physicists emphasize the importance of atomic research in light production . These papers are filled with diagrams showing the energies of various parts of different atoms as deduced by spectroscopists and theoretical physicists , and are running over with the scientific jargon of photons and the quantum theory , words which had not been invented when Edison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence wholly to the atom-probers of recent years . THE GAME OF DEVELOPING A NEW MODERN LIGHT source uSually starts with the selection of some usable type of atom which can be obtained in the gas or vapor form , and which , when bombarded with electrons , will emit light of a desirable  | color . The yellow light of sodium , the blue light of mercury , and the orange-red light of neon have thus far been found most useful . There are not as many atoms from which to choose as one would like . If only a new chemical element were available , one whose atoms physicists themselves could design ! New molecules made from our present stock of atoms may be found handy in this connection , and here we can take the firefly as a useful guide , for he has discovered some good ones . The neon light of the advertising sign is easy to see , as it contrasts well with other lights , but it is rather inefficient to see by . The blue light of mercury has been used for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high actinic value is important . Recently the mercury atom has been put through a new course of training designed to help it emit white light instead of blue ; and with tungsten and sodium , mercury appears about to share the honor of being one of the few atoms of the ninety-six varieties available which will be used to emit much of the artificial light of the future . In 1932 the General Electric Company in America and the Philips Lamp Company in Holland simultaneously perfected sodium lamps for highway lighting . The sodium vapor lamp has attained the highest efficiency ever reached in a lamp of long life . Almost no invisible light is radiated by these lamps , and they often emit 6o lumens per watt , or three times as much as a good incandescent lamp . In sodium lamps well protected from heat loss , efficiencies as high as 300 lumens per watt have been reached . If sodium atoms emitted green light the lamp efficiency would be even greater . The sodium lamp would have been developed much earlier but for a chemical difficulty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they attack and blacken it rapidly ; and it was necessary to hunt for some special kind of glass which would be indifferent to sodium . Several laboratories succeeded in mixing new types of glass which stood up well under the attack of the hot atoms , but these were all expensive . A transparent glaze was finally developed which could be spread in a thin layer on the inside of a cheaper glass , which would then be protected from the sodium . Sodium lamps have been , run as long as 8000 hours without being turned off , but it is found that turning them on and off once a day cuts the life approximately in half . They are called sodium lamps , but actually the gases which fill the tube are a mixture of neon and sodium , the function of the neon being to carry the current when the sodium is cold . The neon atoms outnumber the sodium atoms io , 000 to one ; but since the sodium atoms respond more enthusiastically to the impact of electrons , as soon as they are released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To avoid wasting much energy in keeping the sodium vaporized , street-lighting lamps of this sort are jacketed in a vacuum flask like a transparent thermos bottle . Even with this expensive set-up they turn out to be cheaper to operate under some conditions than incandescent lamps , and as a result many miles of highway are taking on a warm yellow tinge at night . The yellow color makes vision more acute , and it seems likely that the increased brightness made possible by the sodium lamp may become an important factor in reducing the annual waste of a hundred million dollars and thousands of lives through accidents which are said to be caused by faulty lighting . Sodium lamps for indoor lighting have been manufactured , and are highly efficient , but whether we shall ever be willing  | to accept their yellow light for domestic lighting is questionable . Certainly , if we do , new cosmetics must be developed for evening use . The mercury atom holds great promise of being the principal light emitter of the future . At low temperatures the mercury atoms in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current through a column of the vapor is increased , the light becomes whiter . Since a column of vapor can not melt , the vapor lamp has one distinct advantage over a filament lamp , but it suffers instead from the risk that the transparent container which holds its vapor may be melted or blackened . Since quartz melts less readily than glass , clear quartz tubes are used for the most efficient lamps . The Philips Lamp Works in Holland has developed small lamps in which mercury atoms held in a short quartz tube , with a hollow inside no larger than a pin , are made to carry such large electric currents that the pressure in the tube goes up to several tons per square inch . Under such conditions the tubes emit a brilliant white light , by far the most intense and efficient white light ever produced artificially . Lamps having twenty-five times the intrinsic brightness of an incandescent lamp filament have been run for one hundred hours before their quartz envelopes became too opaque to be useful , and lamps run at lower power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamps are tiny things , and if some way can be found to keep their quartz jackets from spoiling so rapidly while burning , a new era in electric lighting should appear . The life of the container remains the chief problem . This seems to be a physical rather than a chemical problem , for the alteration in the quartz appears to be a crystalline change caused by high temperature rather than a chemical reaction . Such lamps are now being used in motion picture studios , on  | airport landing fields , and in many other places where light sources of high intensity are required . A very important development in lighting involves catching much of the previously wasted invisible radiation from lamps and transforming this into visible light . Some lamps emit large amounts of ultra-violet light which does not penetrate their glass envelopes , and which could not be seen if it did . By coating the inside of the lamp bulb with a suitably chosen fluorescent powder , this powder can be made to emit light of almost any desired color under the impact of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available , and are being used increasingly for home and store lighting . Incandescent lamps treated with such fluorescent materials have comparatively low efficiency and brightness ; but when a low-pressure mercury-vapor discharge tube is so coated , as many as 70 lumens per watt may be obtained , the fluorescence increasing the efficiency eighteenf old . There are still many other tricks to be tried to improve lamps . If a mercury lamp tube can not stand large currents , possibly it can stand quick pulses of current every hundredth of a second , giving the tube time to cool off a bit between flashes , but not giving the eye time to notice that the light flashes on and off intermittently . Several lamps of this type are under development , and it seems probable that in some way nature will be further outsmarted in producing the lamps of the future . In the meantime the lamp grows brighter year by year , and its demands for energy grow less . The dark corners of the world ? whether the lung of a baby who has breathed down a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty fathoms under water ? are becoming easier to light . Behind this light , push-  | ing back the shadows , we see the physicist in his laboratory , filled with the artistic satisfaction of having discovered how to persuade atoms to emit ten lumens where only one had gleamed before .  | THE RANSOMED ELECTRON Ask what thou wilt , 0 my Master , for I am the slave of him who possesseth the Iamp . Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp ELECTRICITY has been harnessed by mankind for more than a hundred years , and we take for granted that it should push our streetcars , light our homes , and perform countless other useful and energetic tasks . But it is electricity flowing through wires which does these things , and such electricity , bound as it is to the atoms of matter and confined to flow through wires , is relatively as limited in its abilities as a laborer who can lift a heavy sledge-hammer , but who must be told frequently where to strike . When physicists learned that electricity can be set free from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it is composed can be distilled into a vacuum , there to disport themselves in unaccustomed freedom ? new ways of controlling electricity were found which produced undreamed-of results . To the original class of electrical servants ? motors , dynamos , heaters ? a new type of electrical foreman was added by the invention of the vacuum tube . As colonizers have learned the advantage of directing native workers through native bosses , so engineers soon found great advantage in directing electrical equipment through electronic vacuum tubes . Previously an electric motor required specific directions for each  | desired operation , and could be guided in its operation only through coarse switches and controllers . With these a motor could be ordered to stop or go faster , and it would respond , but since vacuum tubes have become available to act as strawbosses , only general directions need be given . Just say the electrical equivalent of " Arrange to have these street lamps turned on whenever it gets dark , and be sure to turn them off whenever they are not needed , " or , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start these motors and make them open the needle valves that will start water flowing through Hoover Dam , " and it will be done . That the electrons , which must boss the job , are among the smallest particles in the universe , while the eyes in the so-called needle valves , being eight feet across , are quite large enough for the Biblical camel to pass through , need not bother us . We can select vacuum tubes capable of releasing a sufficient number of electrons to control motors of any size . The swarm of electrons freed in even a small vacuum tube is so dense that if every electron were a locust they could darken the skies above an area covering half the Middle West . Yet this electron swarm can be controlled to make the tube a docile and amenable servant . To tell it what to do usually requires far less energy than is needed to raise an eyebrow , and the tube can respond in a split millionth of a second . One of the great advantages of electronic amplifier tubes is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work well in tandem . They can be so connected that when one very sensitive tube receives a delicate electrical signal it can pass this along as a similar but stronger signal to a more powerful tube , which can in turn be made to actuate a still larger tube , and with only a few such amplifications the original signal can be magnified a million or a billion times in power .  | Then clap your hands or whistle and the first tube will actuate the second , the second the third , and so down the line until the final tube of the series will govern as many kilowatts of power as may be needed to level a mountain or span the Pacific with speech . Modern life is being revolutionized by so many agencies that it seems prosaic to add another to the list ; but as the steam engine introduced an industrial revolution , so the electronic vacuum tube seems to be inaugurating an equally farreaching change in our habits of living . That so simple an operation as pumping the air out of a small glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set free an electrical genie capable of such feats as automatically turning on a fountain when we bend over to drink , or spontaneously bringing an elevator level with the floor , is impressive enough . But such useful tricks seem trifles when we consider the changes which are being wrought in the manner of living of millions of people by the subtle magic of this tiny lamp whose product is not light but electrons . Without such tubes we would have no X-rays , no radio broadcasting , no long-distance telephone , no talking motion pictures , no high-fidelity recorded music . To AID IN UNDERSTANDING THE NEW METHODS of controlling energy which the vacuum tube makes available , let us consider briefly the various forms of energy and their relation to the levels of matter , as shown diagrammatically in the figures on pages i r o and I I i . In imagination we shall penetrate the levels of matter , progressing from extreme diversity in the external world to relative simplicity in the world of atoms . As  | the physicist has broadened his understanding of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ease of comprehending the relationships between its individual parts has continually increased . The topmost level in the diagram represents our external world of everyday happenings . Though the object depicted is figure  | an ice cube , it might equally well have been a table or a tree or a star or any other of the thousands of material forms with which we are familiar . On this external level of matter we deal primarily with mechanical energy , and ordinarily move matter about with mechanical forces . Actually , however , these mechanical forces are merely residual forces left over figure  | from a highly complex balancing of the more fundamental forces of electricity and magnetism . Let us imagine that we possess a microscope which will magnify objects 1,000,000 times . Looking through this we find that the ice cube is composed of tiny crystals , which to our newly implemented vision appear as row on row of separate particles . ' We are now in the world of substance rather than of form , and find that objects differ greatly in the regularity of arrangement and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves which traverse matter appear now as rapid mechanical waves which move these particles . Increasing the magnification of our imaginary microscope , we find ourselves looking at the individual particles , and seem now to be in the world of the molecule . Molecules are the fundamental particles of which the different kinds of substance are composed ; and each molecule is continually bouncing about . This bouncing energy we recognize as heat , though to the molecule heat is only extra mechanical energy . Penetrating into the molecule , we find it composed of atoms . Some kinds of molecules consist of a single atom , some of two or more identical atoms , others of many kinds of atoms . But all of the different known molecules ? some half a million varieties ? are composed of only ninety-odd varieties of atoms , the chemical elements . On this atomic plane we are in the realm of chemical energy , for as the atoms combine together into molecules , they store energy in various amounts , much as mechanical energy can be stored in a coiled spring by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an atom , we find it composed of a central core or nucleus which is a cluster of protons and neutrons , surrounded by a swarm of electrons . All of the ninety kinds of atoms which form the elements are built of protons , neutrons , and electrons in  | various combinations . The atomic level of matter is the level on which electrical , magnetic , and gravitational forces are exerted . All the multiplicities of the material world which our senses know are thus resolved into three fundamental physical elements ? the protons , which are heavy particles having positive electrical charges ; the electrons , which are light particles of negative charge ; and the neutrons , heavy uncharged particles . ( Such particles as the positron , the meson , and the neutrino need not worry us here , since they are not required for this simple picture of matter and their exact status in the structure of matter , is not yet clear . ) All the outer forms of energy ? mechanical , sound , heat , light , and chemical energy ? are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and gravitational energy . As a material finger is but a co-operative aggregation of protons , neutrons , and electrons , which wheel in their allotted courses as the stars wheel in the heavens , so when one presses on a table with a finger , the mechanical force which one feels is but an integration of electrical , magnetic , and gravitational forces . But if one wishes to move a piano , one does not trouble to compute all of the fundamental forces exerted on the constituent particles of the piano and one 's hands . Instead of considering these , or the molecules of cellulose and steel which they form , or the cells of wood and crystals of steel which these form , or the boards and wires composed in turn of these cells and crystals , one considers only their mechanical integration , which is a piano , and the . integrated forces , which are mechanical . Sometimes , however , it is advantageous to operate tern . porarily on one of the sub-levels of matter . For example , the feeble ground vibrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave a visible record on a seismograph  | chart ; and a simple arrangement of levers will produce such mechanical amplification directly . But such vibrations are relatively slow compared to those in some of the other forms of energy which our senses can detect , such as heat or sound or light waves . Even when direct methods of amplifying such waves are available they are usually slow-acting , cumbersome , and insensitive by comparison with the amplification of electric current waves which the electrons in a vacuum tube can accomplish . Happenings in the world of electrons are speeded up relative to human experience ? atomic worlds explode , electronic meteors flash across space , in millionths of a second rather than in seconds . So it becomes of great advantage to be able to translate happenings on the human plane of living into changes on this subatomic plane . There waves can be stored , transported , or otherwise controlled , the results being later transformed back into our outer world of sight and sound . Where subtlety of control is needed , or rapidity of action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world is usually very convenient to work in . And it is now becoming possible , by utilizing suitable transforming devices , to move from one form of energy to almost any other at will . Conversion devices are available which will change almost any form of wave motion into the electrical form , and back into the original . The microphone , or " electric ear , " converts sound vibrations into electric currents which it molds to conform to the wave form of the sound . The photo-electric cell , or " electric eye , " turns fluctuations of light intensity into similarly varying currents . Once in the electrical form , electronic vacuum tubes can be put in charge of the amplification or control of any sort of wave motion . As a result of this ability , the electronic vacuum tube has become the most widely applied of all the numerous devices of modern physics . It has  | enabled engineers to carry out many operations on the electrical plane which formerly they could produce only on the mechanical plane , thus putting into their hands tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VACUUM TUBE was nothing more than an incandescent lamp with an extra wire sealed through its bulb . The curiosity of Thomas A. Edison was aroused one day in 1883 by a blue glow which he observed in one of the electric lamps on which he was working . When he sealed an extra wire into the bulb of this lamp , Edison found that he could pull an electric current through the vacuum of the lamp by charging the wire with positive electricity , but could not push it through in the opposite direction . A few years later Professor J. A. Fleming turned Edison 's discovery to advantage by using such a tube as an electrical turnstile which allowed current to flow in one direction but not in the other . Fleming 's device was found useful in the new radio-telegraph on which Guglielmo Marconi was working . But it was not until 1906 , when the vacuum tube was given its " grid , " that it really came into its own . Dr. Lee de Forest was looking for some delicate electrical way to control an electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how actively it should flow . When de Forest put into one of Fleming 's electric valves a grid of wires which could be charged electrically , he found that he could govern the current flowing through the valve by means of a much smaller current sent into this grid . The grid was found to behave much like the throttle of a steam locomotive , with which ,  | using only the muscles of one arm , the engineer can control the energy of a thousand horses pushing its way from the steam boiler . Soon the commercial possibilities of the vacuum tube began to be apparent , and it became the object of intensive investigation in several industrial research laboratories . Scientists of the Bell Telephone System under the direction of Dr. H. D. Arnold , for example , decided that such amplifier tubes might be useful in the long-distance telephone lines , and proceeded to improve them , with success which we have already seen . Some of the early vacuum tubes were very sensitive to signals , while others which had been made in the same way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research laboratory found that this behavior was caused by variation in the amount of gas and moisture left in the tube when the air in it was pumped out . The vacuum pumps of 1915 were not so well-behaved and efficient as those of later years , and much of the magic of the modern tube comes from careful control of its vacuum . Tubes which are to be used with high voltage electricity require an especially " hard " vacuum ? one in which less than one molecule remains out of every hundred million molecules of air which the tube originally contained . Tubes which are to carry large currents , on the other hand , have their vacuums purposely " softened " by the introduction of a small amount of argon gas or mercury vapor . The widest use for electron tubes has always been in radio receiving sets . From three to thirty small glass-enclosed vacuums in which electrons are freed are needed for a single set , some to detect the incoming signals , others to amplify these up to the level of hearing , still others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1920 tubes for a radio receiver cost seven dollars apiece , and fewer than 100,000 were in use . Twenty-five years later the average tube sold for less than a dollar , and a hundred million tubes were needed annually to keep the radios of the world in operation . In 1920 only a few varieties of vacuum tubes were made , and the general-purpose tube of that day can hardly be compared to the specialist tubes which later became available . But , like doctors who deal with the eye , ear , nose , and throat , some of these modern tubes are skilled in three or four diverse fields . The high-sounding names which they sometimes bear are merely Greek ways of telling what they can do . Thus " duplex diode high mu triode " is a fancy name for a tube which retails at about a dollar , yet will effectively perform the functions of four tubes of the 1920 variety costing seven dollars apiece . By deflecting some portion of the current which has passed through so that it will return to influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up electrical oscillations in wires which send out radio waves that travel for great distances and are now used to carry sound and speech through space . The more power a tube can radiate , the farther will these waves travel ; so the electrons in radio transmitting tubes must carry large currents instead of the minute currents carried when signals are picked up in a receiver . This requirement has led to the development of huge tubes which will free millions of times as many electrons as are needed in a sensitive detector tube . It is no mere flourish of words to call gigantic the entity which resides in one of these great vacuum tubes , for through a mere dozen of them may pass all the power with which ten electric locomotives pull as many fast freight trains . One large tube , developed for transatlantic telephony , handles two hun-  | dred and fifty kilowatts of power continuously ? more than enough to supply the ordinary electrical needs of fifty homes . Not the smallest problem in building such great tubes is that of fastening their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will leak in at the joints . To get the large currents which must be controlled into the glass-enclosed vacuum without cracking the glass is the next problem . The metal cylinder used to gather the electrons which are freed in the tube would quickly become white hot and melt under their bombardment if a hundred gallons of water a minute were not used to cool it . Although an electron is one of the smallest objects which has yet been discovered , when a large crowd of electrons moves rapidly in one direction it can cut through steel like an oxyacetylene flame . Originally the bulbs of small vacuum tubes were made of glass by the technique developed for the incandescent lamp , but glass was not , of course , really necessary , since no light need get out . To encase the vacuum in metal would give a tube of increased sturdiness , make practicable a smaller bulb , and provide a desirable shield from electrical disturbances . Glass must be used to insulate the wires which carry electrons into and out of the bulb , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sealed to metal very easily , but a difficulty appears when the glass and metal change temperature , for if either material expands as much as one part in thirty thousand more than the other , strains are developed which will crack the joint . Furthermore , the two materials must expand together no matter how irregularly either chooses to behave . After much research both the Westinghouse and the General Electric laboratories developed alloys of iron , cobalt , and nickel which closely dupli-  | cated the expansion of a suitable glass . Metal radio tubes then became practicable . The fabrication of the new metal bulbs was made possible by the use of vacuum tubes themselves ; in particular , of the sturdy young thyratrons , three-electrode gas-filled tubes capable of passing thousands of amperes when tickled electrically . The metal parts of the tube shells are welded together by sending currents of 50,000 amperes or more through the metal for a small fraction of a second . If a trifle too much current is used for such welding , the metal will be burned ; if too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together : and in either case the tube will leak . Only an electronic valve could exert the delicate control needed to make such welding possible , and throughout industry thyratron welding is rapidly entering new fields . Three hundred thousand watts of power passing through one thyratron tube can be controlled with less than half a watt of power on its grid . Such an amplification of more than half a million times is equivalent to enabling a man to pick up a locomotive with the ease with which he would ordinarily lift a baseball . WHAT ARE THESE ELECTRONS which have been freed from matter and effectively apprenticed for the use of man ? On the day in 1897 when Sir J. J. Thomson , famous British physicist , found that electricity consists of countless charged particles , all alike , he could have had little idea of the many services which his new " corpuscles " would be performing for humanity a few years later . One or two simple vacuum tubes had been invented , but no one quite knew what made them oper-  | ate or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacuum in the tubes was filled with electrical particles which weighed far less than even the lightest atom , and these particles all seemed to be alike no matter from what kinds of atoms he drew them . Thomson discovered the electron when he succeeded in devising a method of weighing particles of pure electricity . Since chemists take great pride in balances which are sensitive enough to weigh a pencil mark , one may well ask how Thomson was able to weigh something so light , so imponderable and elusive , as a single electron ; something which , according to his measurements , weighed so little that a billion billion billion of them ( 10 with 26 zeros after it , or more conveniently , to save space , 102 ? ) were needed to register an ounce . If the ratio of weights is considered in each case , an electron is , in fact , as much lighter than a feather as a feather is lighter than the earth . What Thomson did was to shoot a narrow beam of electrons across a large evacuated glass bulb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which glowed brilliantly at the spot where the electrons struck . Then he measured how far this glowing spot moved sideways when he pushed and pulled on the electron beam with electric and magnetic forces . Thomson found , strangely enough , that if all of the electrons were hurled across the vacuum with the same speed they would all strike the screen at the same point , no matter how he deflected them . This showed that they were all alike electrically . We might use a similar method to sort out a packing case full of billiard balls mixed with basketballs . We could take the case to a playground where a long slide was available , and arrange to dump all the balls together down the slide . At the  | bottom of the slide we could , by means of a large electric fan , blow a strong blast of air across the path of the balls . Now let the balls roll down . When the basketballs reach the air-blast they will be blown more to one side than the billiard balls , because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of balls of assorted sizes and weights were rolled down such a slide , one could calculate just where , across a flat playground , one could expect to find rolling a ball of any given ratio of size to weight . The experiment with the electrons is even easier to perform than that with the balls , because it can be carried out in a small evacuated bulb and the forces involved can be controlled more closely . However , we should not lose sight of the fact that if the electrons were enlarged to billiard-ball size , Thomson 's vacuum bulb would stretch across the solar system . The vacuum tube used by Thomson in these electronweighing experiments has been developed into the modern cathode-ray oscillograph , with which electrical voltages and currents can be measured which are varying so rapidly that no material pointer could possibly follow them . The moving finger of the electron beam is made to write so rapidly on its scintillating fluorescent screen that the eye can follow only the trail of light it leaves behind . Some modern radio receivers contain tiny tubes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show visually when the set is correctly tuned . Thomson 's tube has also been evolved further into the " Kinescopes " and " Iconoscopes " which make television practicable , as will be discussed in a later chapter . Though Thomson 's experiment showed the existence of electrons , and that they are all alike , it did not tell quite the whole story on the weight of the electron . To determine this  | weight precisely required that the charge of the electron be measured ? its electrical charge , which is merely a measure of how forcibly two electrons will repel each other when held a certain distance apart . To determine this charge , in 1910 Professor R. A. Millikan performed a celebrated experiment in which he trapped individual electrons on tiny drops of oil , which drops he could observe through a powerful microscope as they floated in the air . By measuring the electrical force required to make a given droplet rise instead of fall , Millikan was able to measure the electrical pull on the combined drop and electron , and hence the charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may stumble on something startling , something which may profoundly affect human progress . In 1927 Drs . C. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer of the Bell Telephone Laboratories discovered that electrons have waves which steer them about in space . Theoretical physicists had found a few years previously that if electrons should possess such waves , a number of mystifying bits of atomic behavior could be explained . But Davisson and Germer were not looking for electron waves when they found them . They were merely trying to see what would happen when electrons were bounced against a piece of nickel in a vacuum . A surprisingly large number of the great experimental discoveries have thus been made by scientists who , while following the direction in which their curiosity led them , have unexpectedly beheld a great truth lying in their path . The discovery of electron waves had immediate practical results . Light waves had been used in the microscope for years ; why not a new kind of microscope which would operate with electron waves ? That we can not see electron waves did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | could be made visible by some sort of energy transformation . The scheme worked ; by shooting electrons against surfaces which can not readily be studied with ordinary microscopes , many new secrets of matter are being revealed . Even paints and printing inks , stainless steel and glass , are being studied with electrons bouncing around in vacuum tubes ? with electron microscopes . ONE LONE ELECTRON is rather an insignificant creature , but when a big electron crowd is assembled it can exert forces which will drive ships across the ocean or flash thunderbolts across the sky . Hence the academic-sounding job of pulling electrons from atoms , as corn is shelled from the cob , has great commercial importance . Electrons pervade all matter and can be obtained only from the atoms of matter . Though every atom must be paid an energy ransom for any electron that it releases , some types of atoms drive a harder bargain than others . How can electrons be freed most cheaply ? has come to be a question of great economic importance . In the research laboratories of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western Electric , and Westinghouse , where most of the development of the modern vacuum tube has been carried out , improvements in the efficiency with which electrons can be released from matter are still being made . Such research has already shown how to free twenty times as many electrons for a cent as was possible thirty years ago . The simplest way to set electrons free is to heat in a vacuum a filament of tungsten or some other tough metal until some of its electrons boil out like smoke particles  | streaming from a log of green wood in a fire . Such electrons are called thermions , since they are ions ? electrically charged particles of atomic or subatomic dimensions ? produced by heat . The hot filament of an incandescent lamp , for example , emits thermions in countless millions until the space around it is so filled with them that no more can emerge . In a vacuum tube these freed electrons are pulled across the vacuum and sent flowing to work through external wires , and the supply is constantly replenished from the hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current of two amperes could be made to release three hundred billion billion electrons every second , which comes to two hundred billion billion electrons for a cent . This makes electrons sound pretty cheap , but since the work of the world begins to need a great many of them the twenty-fold increase in efficiency which has come from improving the filament results in a saving of over $12,000,000 a year on power bills to run radio sets alone . In one year we thus save more than enough to pay for the entire cost of the research which made the saving possible for all time . It has been found that the atoms of which our material world is made are composed of tiny hard cores about which circle groups of electrons , a definite number of electrons in each kind of atom . Normally the core or nucleus of an atom is surrounded by exactly the right number of electrons to neutralize its charge , but if forced to do so by electrical pressure the atom will temporarily give up one or more of these electrons , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atoms release electrons more willingly than others , and one of the jobs of the physicist in recent years has been to measure the forces with which various atoms hold on to their  | electrons . The results of his findings were immediately applied to the improvement of the vacuum-tube filament . A sulphur atom , for example , was found to be a rugged individualist which holds tenaciously to all sixteen of its electrons , while a caesium atom was found to be most cooperative in willingly sparing one of its fifty-five electrons . Obviously sulphur should not be used in vacuum-tube filaments , but caesium seemed worth investigating . Caesium metal melts on a warm day , however , so it could hardly be used for making red-hot filaments . But when a layer of caesium salts one molecule thick was spread on an ordinary tungsten wire , this was found to emit clouds of electrons while the filament was still relatively cool . Thorium was found to behave in much the same manner : when one per cent of thorium oxide was added to tungsten of which filaments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxide molecules kept oozing out to keep the filament coated , and at a bare red heat 100,000 times as many electrons swarmed out in a second as had come from pure tungsten . This made possible the production of new tubes which required less power for their operation and which lasted longer before they burned out . More important than either of these advantages was the fact that it now became possible to take electrons , not directly from the filament , but from a thin metal tube coated with electron-emitting salts , inside which the filament could be placed for heating purposes . Vacuum tubes , instead of requiring expensive current from inconvenient batteries , could then be heated with cheap alternating current from the lighting mains . This improvement made possible the operation of a radio set from a wall power outlet without introduction of an objectionable humming noise ; radio receivers at once came within economic reach of additional millions of families .  | They must have wanted them , for within a few years there were 37,000,000 radio receivers in 24,000,000 of the 32,000 , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio receiver is turned on , the sounds from it increase in loudness as the tube filaments slowly heat the electron-emitters and electrons stream out in increasing numbers . Nowadays the filament in the tube glows but dully , yet from each square inch of its hot surface flow more than ten billion electrons in each second , electrons set free scientifically and cheaply . 4 6 SOME VACUUM TUBES respond to light signals rather than to electrical signals , and these have been popularly dubbed " electric eyes . " Scientifically they are known as photo-electric cells and technically as phototubes . Without these inanimate watchers , talking motion pictures would hardly be possible , for such tubes are needed to help convert the light-variations on the sound-film into speech and music ; the movie industry now uses ioo , 000 phototubes a year . Such a tube can be made sensitive enough to detect light which is invisible to a human eye , and to respond electrically to a change in illumination far slighter than any real eye could hope to detect . Since it will also respond a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being , it can often be applied effectively to jobs in industry where men would be slow or careless . Many a workman operating a great press still has two arms because a phototube which was attending to business held the power off when his arm got in the way . The photo-electric vacuum tube has been in existence for many more years than has the thermo-electric vacuum tube .  | In the phototube the electrons are freed from their parent atoms by the light itself . The fact that light can free electricity from matter was discovered in 1887 by the same Dr. Heinrich Hertz who discovered the ether waves which made radio possible , and in the course of the same experiments . How the electrons are freed by the light was explained by Professor Albert Einstein of relativity fame , and the explanation he gave , for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize , forms one of Einstein 's greatest contributions to physics . The first phototubes were comparatively insensitive and erratic in their behavior , but when such tubes were found useful in developing new million-dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made the tubes ten times more sensitive , as well as stable and dependable in operation . Theoretically , phototubes can be made at least a hundred times as sensitive as they now are , so physicists are challenged to find how better to free electrons from atoms by means of light waves . The phototube makes a very effective partner for the thyratron , that unobserving but powerful member of the electron-tube family . This tube has one principal reaction ? to allow a tremendous burst of current to flow whenever it feels a tiny twinge of voltage . Such a twinge the phototube will supply when light falls on it , and the two tubes are often found together , resembling in relative size and strength a circus elephant being led by a diminutive equestrienne . Set a phototube to watching beans or cigars or oranges or cakes of soap as they pass by it on a belt conveyor , and it will rest unconcerned so long as the normal amount and color of light are reflected from these objects . But let a browner bean appear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwrapped cake of soap , and quicker than a wink it gives an  | electrical nudge to its great dull thyratron partner . The thyratron is blind but it responds with alacrity to the one signal which can stimulate it ; it feels the tweak of voltage from the phototube , brightens up , and immediately spurts a burst of current through an electromagnet , which quickly jerks a lever and kicks the offending article to one side in a thousandth of the time required to tell about it . I 7 THE VACUUM TUBES OF TOMORROW will be as much more accomplished than those of today as the present automobile excels that of 1910 . An entirely new principle of electronic amplification which is now approaching perfection promises much . The vacuum tube called an electron-multiplier , which utilizes this principle , combines in one small glass bulb the functions of a phototube and a dozen amplifier tubes . A tiny swarm of electrons , which is set free when a faint light beam strikes a sensitive surface inside one end of the tube , is pulled across the vacuum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another surface coated with material whose atoms will release electrons readily . Each electron is bounced so forcibly against the atoms of this surface that on the average it knocks out five more electrons . These secondary electrons are then in turn hurled against another sensitive surface , from which each produces its further quota of freed electrons . The same procedure can be repeated as many as a dozen times in a single tube , with the result that each electron initially set free by the light at one end of the tube may cause a hundred million electrons to be freed at the other end . Such a tube opens great possibilities in television , for with its aid  | the " electric eye " can be made far more sensitive than formerly , and glaring lamps are no longer necessary to illuminate scenes which are to be broadcast . Still greater advantage will result if the electron-multiplier principle can be applied to amplifier tubes in which electrons are released from a hot filament . This is impossible at present because the sensitive coating on the plates which furnish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Probably a material can be found which will give up its electrons readily , yet will be less affected by heat . The cash earnings of the electrons which have been ransomed from matter have already run into billions of dollars ; and in addition , putting electrons to work has put men to work . That four great new industries ? the telephone , the radio , the phonograph , and the motion picture industries ? rest directly on the vacuum tube and could not exist on so vast a scale without it , is usually ignored when new devices are blamed for technological unemployment . When science set the electron free it took a great step forward toward freeing mankind from its yoke of want , hunger , and disease . The ransomed electron has already contributed in a thousand ways , and if the further opportunities it offers are properly utilized , will contribute in countless further ways to the comfort , safety , and security of human beings .  | SOUND BORROWS WINGS I'Il put a girdle round about the earth In forty minutes .

But the tone was too casual . " Why do you want to know ? " " Oh , I 've just been carrying on a conversation with a fellow in Somaliland , and I wondered where he lived . " The world is now roughly divided into two classes of people ? those who would accept the above ( which actually occurred , by the way ) as an obvious exaggeration , and those who would consider it a challenge . In the latter category are persons who happen to be possessors of short-wave radio receivers and are given to occasional listening on other wavebands than those reserved for broadcasting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how he , that very morning , heard an aviator over Hong Kong asking for land-  | ing directions , or a trans-Pacific plane requesting bearings . Before our appreciation of the achievements of radio has been dulled completely by familiarity , it is worth recalling the discoveries which have made it possible for an American boy to carry on an incidental two-way conversation with a British lad half the world away , through the effortless direction of a beam of energy carrying less power than is required to operate an automobile headlight . During the coronation ceremonies of King George VI , an early morning walk of a few miles through the streets of any city in eastern America would have sufficed to convince a skeptic that a wide audience listens to radio broadcasts of events of great interest . Block after block , from one group of homes and then from another , came the droning voice of the Archbishop of Canterbury . Truly no archbishop before , whether he spoke with the tongues of men or of angels , had such opportunities of sound production . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was caught up and repeated in a responsive chorus by more than forty million inanimate voices throughout the world . And the stroller , catching the Archbishop 's words filtering through windows three thousand miles from Westminster Abbey , nevertheless heard them sooner than did persons at the far end of the building in which the words ' originated ; for the sounds of his voice traveled through the air only about rr oo feet in a second , while during that time radio waves could carry them around the world seven times . Radio-telephony , in its most modern use of broadcasting entertainment , is one of a few scientific advances which have been accepted by the world even more rapidly than they could be developed satisfactorily to meet the demand . In 1921 radio burgeoned overnight into a new industry which  | within fifteen years came to rank in stature with the motion picture and automobile industries , and soon joined the telephone as the second industry dealing with sound waves to earn a gross income of more than a billion dollars a year . In the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 37,000,000 radio receiving sets in operation , and 8,000,000 new sets were being sold annually . Throughout the world 25,000 registered stations were broadcasting news , entertainment , education , propaganda . That broadcasts of exceptional interest sometimes attract 50,000,000 listeners is well established , and , entirely apart from the wishful claims of advertisers , there is good evidence that leading comedians play to Sunday audiences of many millions . Like any new toy in the hands of a precocious youngster with a large income , radio is being abused ; and time is required to get its operation into equilibrium with the needs of society . Even twenty years after the inception of broadcasting , many radio receivers in homes were being kept in operation from morning to night , whether anyone was listening to them or not , and carefully obtained statistics showed that each of the 37,000,000 existing receivers in the United States was kept running more than four hours a day on the average . Quantity rather than quality was and still is the watchword , but the social need for the radio is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must not be allowed to overshadow the importance of radio in the fields of commerce , navigation , and aviation . In an age and country which contain one radio receiver to each four members of the population , a special effort may be required to get into a suitable frame of mind properly to appreciate the magnitude of the accomplishments which were needed to make radio-telephony possible . Such an effort  | might well involve imagining a bull-voiced orator of a previous century , who , seized with an overwhelming desire to send his voice into a neighboring county from his own front porch , learned by some divine revelation that he could perform this feat if he would apply himself to the problem . Should he take the obvious course of climbing a near-by hill each morning to carry out a series of exercises in voice projection designed to strengthen his lungs and increase his broadcasting power ? As a matter of fact , sound waves have been sent completely around the world under their own power , but to do this requires the efforts of a mountain rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Krakatoa in 1883 produced sound pulses which circled the earth at least three times , and this loudest sound in history lasted for several days , though after it had traveled 3000 miles its waves became so smooth that a barometer rather than a human ear was required to detect them . But sound waves in the air are at the mercy of every breeze , and any ordinary sound will be reflected and scattered by every tree and hillside , and so weakened by its own spreading as soon to be submerged in general atmospheric noise . Since direct attempts at its solution must inevitably fail , the problem of transporting sound over long distances without wires had to be solved , like so many other human problems , by subtle indirection . If waves can not be sent through one medium , transform them and send them through another medium , says the physicist . Thus , by using his standard trick of energy-conversion , he learned to transport speech and music almost any distance ; and now conversation has been carried 3000 miles with waves containing energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sound waves are first changed into equivalent electrical waves , as in the tele-  | phone ; these are then fastened to electromagnetic waves which will travel at high speed through space ; then at the destination the sound is separated from the carrier waves and reclaimed in its original form . In this way a laugh or a song can be whisked through space like a fairy princess on a magic carpet , to arrive radiant and , barring static , with not a harmonic displaced . As LONG AGO AS 188o Alexander Graham Bell and other physicists developed a method of carrying sound without wires which operated on the principle of our modern radio , the sound waves being in fact transported on a beam of light . They called their device the photophone . But light travels only in straight lines , and since we live on a curving earth such ultra-short wave methods of radio had severe limitations and could be used over only short distances . Even if we could hope to send a beam of light around the globe by using mirrors , fogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves were required to carry the signals ; waves which would not be intimidated by interfering masses of matter , but would sail majestically through or around them . In 1864 James Clark Maxwell , one of the greatest theoretical physicists who ever lived , was working in England on a theory of the electric and magnetic forces with which electrified particles attract and repel one another . Maxwell discovered mathematically that waves of an electromagnetic nature can exist in empty space , and that light and radiant heat are just such waves . Light and heat waves were known to be extremely short from one crest to the next , but Maxwell decided that longer waves of a similar nature might also exists  | Actually every lightning flash in the heavens had been radiating such waves in abundance since the beginning of time , but no one was aware of this , and so far as mankind was concerned Maxwell 's long waves remained only predictions for more than twenty years . In 1887 Professor Heinrich Hertz , a young German physicist , was in his laboratory making miniature flashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spark coil . He chanced to notice that occasionally another spark would jump across a narrow gap between two ends of a loop of wire which was not connected to his apparatus . He quickly investigated the cause of this extra spark , and soon found that rays sent through space from the first spark were producing the second . He rightly concluded that these were the electromagnetic waves which Maxwell had predicted , and Hertzian waves were thus given to the world . Essentially the same as light waves , they differ in being longer and in vibrating more slowly . A ray of light will endeavor to shake any electron it may strike from side to side more than ioo trillion times in a second , while these more leisurely waves will shake it only a few million times . Their greater length enables the Hertzian waves to pass through such minor bits of matter as trees and wooden buildings , and waves still longer than these can cross mountains and seas like giants in seven-league boots . The world of physics was set into great excitement by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated and extended in a dozen laboratories . At the University of Bologna , Professor A. Righi demonstrated the waves before his classes in physics , and in one of these classes was an eighteen-year-old student named Guglielmo Marconi . Marconi 's imagination was fired . Why should n't such waves be harnessed to carry signals across space ? Why  | should n't he be the one to try this ? He applied himself with renewed diligence to learning all that was then known about the theory of electric waves , and by the time he was twentyone , in 1895 , he was ready to start experimenting . Marconi set sparks to jumping between two metal balls connected to electrical condensers and loops of wire , as Hertz had done , but soon found that the radiated waves could be detected at greater distances if he held farther apart the two metal plates which formed one of the condensers . He raised one plate higher and higher , and lowered the other until finally it rested on the ground , which seemed to make matters better . Soon he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between two masts , and for the lower plate the ground itself . Whenever he was able to double the height of the masts which held up his network of wires , he found that the distance at which the waves could be detected increased four times ; so eventually he had raised these aerial wires Soo feet above the earth . Thus did Marconi discover the principle of the antenna or radio aerial , and learned that to launch waves properly into the ether he must have the antenna grip this ether as broadly as possible . Electrical oscillations were produced by the spark , and these , surging up and down the wire of the antenna , set a section of ether to quivering , from which electromagnetic ripples spread out through space . Marconi soon found that he required a more sensitive detector of the waves than Hertz had used , and for this purpose he adopted the coherer , a device well known at the time in physical laboratories , which permitted a current to flow through a telephone receiver whenever incoming waves set up a surging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected . In the telephone the dots and dashes of the  | telegraph code could be heard , produced by interrupting with a telegraph key the spark which set up oscillations in the transmitting antenna . There was no need to furnish any sound for the waves to carry , since the spark produced both sound waves and electric oscillations at the same time . Within a year Marconi was able to send signals across space for two miles ; by the end of 1897 he had pushed them 18 miles , and in 1899 , with a very high antenna , signals were sent 85 miles across the English Channel . It appeared probable that to send the signals farther would require impracticable amounts of power , and that the curvature of the earth would require use of impossibly tall masts , but both of these difficulties turned out to be non-existent . Marconi 's genius lay to a remarkable degree in refusing to be deterred by difficulties that had not yet been proved . Soon , instead of further increasing the power of the waves sent out by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in detecting the signals after their attenuating trip through space . He had to work without amplifiers of any kind , and was handicapped a million-fold in available sensitivity compared to those who use our modern methods . But Sir Oliver Lodge had previously discovered how to tune electrical circuits to resonate with each other , much as a pair of connected pendulums adjusted to a common rate will affect each other much more than if not so adjusted ; and Marconi made use of Lodge 's method to improve his circuits . When a receiver was tuned to resonance with a given transmitter , not only would it respond more readily to the signals from this , and hence make them louder , but when several transmitters were operating simultaneously a receiver would respond only to that transmitter which sent waves vibrating at exactly the proper frequency to build up current surges in its circuit .  | In 1901 , on his first attempt , Marconi spanned the Atlantic Ocean with three faint audible dots , repeated over and over , and the world soon awoke to the possibilities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth , instead of being lost in space by following a straight path ! Marconi was twenty-seven . Eight years later he was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics . Marconi 's experiments showed that electromagnetic waves could be used to carry sounds over great distances , but the sounds he used were of necessity the harshly sibilant tones of an electric spark . For radio-telephony some method of producing electrical oscillations of smooth and even character , without built-in sounds , was needed . Methods of producing quiet electrical oscillations were soon developed independently by several physicists , and in 1906 Reginald Fessenden applied such undamped oscillations to an antenna , arranged a microphone to incorporate any desired sound into the structure of the waves radiated , and sent his voice and a record or two out over the ether , to the startled enthusiasm of a few ships ' radio operators who happened to be listening , even in those early days . Still the radio-telephone lacked the final element to make it practical for broadcasting purposes ? the three-electrode vacuum tube . Not until 1912 did de Forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in that same year he found that the tubes could also be used to produce smooth oscillations , and thus could produce the waves as well as detect and amplify them . Since that day the electron tube has become the most important device in radio and is now used for no less than six entirely separate functions in transmitters and receivers . Before 1918 the principal uses of radio were for communica-  | tion between ships and across the Atlantic Ocean , and for trans-etheric chatter among more than five thousand licensed amateur operators in the United States who were interested in radio as a hobby . When World War I ended , thousands of young men who had been trained in radio were returned to civil life , and hundreds of new amateur licenses were issued each week . Then in 1920 a musical program which was informally but regularly transmitted from a Pittsburgh radio station attracted increasing numbers of listeners , and soon radio broadcasting swept the land and the world . By 1927 there were 733 broadcasting stations in the United States alone . IN A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into space are produced in front of a microphone , or electric ear , which thereupon creates an electrical replica of their wave form . This replica , carried by a constantly varying current of electrons , is amplified with vacuum tubes and is then sent to another tube , called a modulator , which , like a tailor cutting cloth to a pattern , molds electrical oscillations of high frequency to the form of the sound replica . Though the process by which an electrical replica of a sound vibration can be attached to other vibrations is somewhat difficult to visualize , the result is shown in the curves on page 140 , which are traces of the two kinds of vibrations , apart and together . To distinguish between them the vibrations of low frequency , which result from the sound , are called audio oscillations ; those of high frequency , which are to produce the radio waves , are called radio oscillations . The radio oscillations are produced by a large vacuum tube  | which has been put into a state of chronic electrical jitters . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and coils in connection with the tube . When the oscillations have been molded by the sound replica figure they are sent into the antenna , which then launches corresponding electromagnetic waves into space . The radio waves used for ordinary broadcasting are so long that a skyscraper will interfere with their passage no more than a matchstick impedes the passage of ripples on water . As the waves proceed through space their amplitude grows continually less , but their length between successive crests , and the rate at which they vibrate , remain exactly constant . All radio waves travel with the speed of light ( 186,000 miles a second ) , and the number of times a wave will vibrate  | in a second can be determined by dividing its wavelength into this velocity . A typical wave used in broadcasting is onefifth of a mile long ; and such a wave oscillates about a million times in a second . An important station may radiate a hundred kilowatts of power in the form of ether waves . By the time this energy has spread over the earth so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than one-billionth of it comes within the grasp of any single antenna . The term broadcasting is very descriptive , for in no other process does man spread energy so widely over space . When the waves strike any metallic object they seize on the electrons in this which are free to move , and set them to surging back and forth as the various parts of the wave pass across them . A receiving antenna is such an object , so disposed that the waves will produce the maximum surge of electrons in it ; these surging currents are then amplified in the receiving set until the signals they carry can be detected . The electronic surges which the incoming waves produce can be greatly increased if the wave impulses are timed to occur exactly with the interval required for the electrons to be swished from one end of the antenna to the other ; and this interval can be adjusted by tuning or adjusting the electrical vibration rate of the antenna or an electrical circuit associated with it . As a violin string has a natural frequency of vibration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural frequency at which it will oscillate when struck electrically . To change this vibration frequency , radio receivers are provided with a control by which the electrical capacity of a condenser in the circuit can be adjusted , an operation analogous to turning the peg on a violin to change the tension on a string .  | The actual amount of energy picked up by a receiving antenna is incredibly minute , but vacuum-tube amplifiers are able to coddle any faint incoming wave and bring it up to the level of human perceptivity , so long as it is stronger than the background of electrical noises which disturbances in the atmosphere constantly provide . Man himself produces much artificial static with his numerous modern appliances , for anything electrical which is turned on and off rapidly is a fruitful source of oscillations which are sent back into the power lines , and these can then radiate waves in profusion . An electrical machine in Cambridge , Massachusetts , was in fact at one time found to be the origin of noises which were greatly interfering with radio reception in Philadelphia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be a thousand times less than that with which a breeze shakes a leaf , so it is not surprising that such weak signals are easily overwhelmed . But a signal strong enough to remain above the level of background noise can be amplified a billion times in intensity , if necessary , until it is enabled to produce audible sound from a loud-speaker . In the early days of radio , when receivers were relatively coarse and insensitive and little amplification was possible , receiving antennas were of necessity high and far-reaching , to insure a wide embrace to any incoming ether waves . As receivers have improved in sensitivity , the antenna has become less important . A big aerial may do more harm than good when near streetcar lines or other sources of electrical interference , since it may pick up as much extra static as increased signal , and much more interference from close at hand than would be intercepted by a small aerial . The currents produced by the incoming waves in the tuned receiver are first amplified with vacuum tubes and then sent  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to strip the load of audio vibrations from the carrier vibrations and cast the latter aside . Next the audio vibrations are further amplified , are subjected to various refurbishing processes ( which are discussed in a later section ) , and are then fed to the loud-speaker which is to transform them back to sound . An important development of broadcasting after 1930 was the rapid growth of chain networks , groups of transmitting stations fed with sound from one or more central studios by special telephone lines . One large network had a telephone bill for leased wires of over $3,000,000 during one recent year . The telephone equipment ? microphones and amplifiers and transmission lines ? must be specially designed for tone quality and volume range , since it is required to pass vibrations of from 30 to 5000 cycles per second at least , instead of the limited range handled by the ordinary telephone . Chain broadcasting will doubtless be greatly extended in future , since high-quality programs can thus be more widely disseminated and the speech and music , being exposed to static and interference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE ELECTRICAL OSCILLATIONS most conveniently produced with types of apparatus which are readily available are those vibrating from 15,000 to 1,500,000 times a second ? 15 to 1500 kilocycles . ( One million cycles is one thousand kilocycles or one megacycle . ) Such oscillations radiate waves which vary in length from zo , 000 meters to zoo meters , the more rapid oscillations producing the shorter waves . Early experiments showed that long waves would carry signals farther with a  | given amount of power than would short , so the longest practicable waves , stretching more than twelve miles from crest to crest , were assigned to transatlantic stations . Since no commercial station wanted to use the easily daunted 200 meter waves , they were assigned to the amateur radio enthusiasts . The amateurs were not particularly pleased at being given the tag-end of the electromagnetic spectrum , but this assignment was to result in a remarkable discovery . Some amateur operators , making tests with waves even shorter than the assigned zoo meters , began to hear one another clearly over astonishing distances . Before long they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by using amounts of energy which would serve to send long-wave signals only a few miles . The short waves were found to be less dependable than long waves , and signals sent with them often became temporarily inaudible , but their occasional penetration of vast distances suggested important possibilities . The reasons for the fading and the great range of the short waves soon became obvious . A radio antenna , it was found , emits two sets of waves : a sky-wave which travels off into space , and a ground-wave which keeps one end attached to earth like a trailing finger , and so is led around the bulging contours of the globe . When waves longer than zoo meters were produced the ground wave was being used , for the skywave traveled straight out into space and much of it was lost . But , strangest and luckiest bit of providential co-operation , nature was found to have arranged a set of radio mirrors high up in the air , from fifty to two hundred miles above the ground , extending all the way around the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ' co meters , though to longer waves they are transparent . The existence above the earth of electrically charged layers  | of gas in which are great numbers of ions , produced when electrons are knocked out of the molecules which compose the atmosphere , was suggested independently by Arthur E. Kennelly and Oliver Heaviside . It became evident that these Kennelly-Heaviside layers , extending as hollow globes around the earth , were the mirrors which reflected the radio waves . Some of these layers of ions are now known to be produced by ultra-violet light from the sun , which explains why they change markedly between day and night , while in others the ionization is produced by electrons shot from the solar disk . Thus the close connection between sunspots and radio is explained , for , when the sun shows great numbers of spots on its face , the number of particles which it shoots out is increased , and the ionized reflecting layers in the earth 's atmosphere are greatly strengthened . Particularly effective radio-mirrors are found 65 , 130 , and 190 miles above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these layers becomes too low for good reflecting , and they allow the signals which strike them to escape into space . Music coming clearly at one moment from across the world may then fade completely away , to reappear a few seconds later , as the hole which has developed in the heavenly reflector is closed up . The reflecting layers change their positions and densities between day and night and with the seasons , so each short-wave radio broadcasting station is usually assigned several wavelengths , that it may be equipped to use waves to fit the reflecting layers which happen to be available . Fading of signals is one of the greatest limitations of shortwave radio , and how much can be done to eliminate it in home receiving sets is questionable . But much can and is being done by large commercial laboratories , which receive short-wave overseas broadcasts and then re-broadcast them  | over chain networks . Several systems for reducing fading have been devised ; one will serve for illustration . Three separate , widely spaced antennas are used to pick up the same signals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three are then sent to a common receiver , which puts them together into one signal whose intensity is governed by that from the antenna which happens to be providing the loudest signal at the moment . Usually , fading occurs in only one or two of the antennas at a time , one at least always giving a strong output . The signal strength is thus kept almost uniform , and fading is reduced to less than one-tenth its ordinary value . Though effective , such installations are too expensive to be used except where speech and music from them are to be distributed to thousands of listeners . Static , the major curse of radio communication , comes mostly from thunderstorms . A good strong flash of lightning may discharge 250,000 amperes from cloud to earth , and can thus set half the antennas in the world vibrating , no matter how they may be tuned . There is , however , less static in the short-wave part of the radio spectrum than at longer wavelengths . The best way of overcoming static is to send out far more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has obvious limitations . Arranging the sending antenna to focus its waves in the desired direction , as a searchlight focuses its beam , is helpful , and this can be done very effectively with short waves . Also the receiving antenna can be focused so that it will preferentially pick up waves from a given direction , and thus interference from unwanted signals not originating along the line connecting transmitter and receiver , whether from human or celestial broadcasters , is reduced . Perhaps even more important than the traveling ability of  | the short radio waves , which range from loo to lo meters in length ( 3 to 30 megacycles in frequency ) is the fact that when they are used , more broadcasting stations can launch signals into a given area without mutual interference . To reproduce sounds with even moderate fidelity requires that vibrations of from 6o to 5000 cycles be carried , and this vibration load sticks out from the carrier wave like a barn door carried on a bicycle . If a station which is broadcasting on 300,000 cycles transmits sound waves containing 5000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station broadcasting on 305,000 cycles or 295,000 cycles , and a gap of at least io kilocycles must be left between frequency assignments of broadcasting stations which might interfere . The necessity for this is shown by the " monkey-chatter " which comes from sensitive receivers when two stations interfere . In the standard broadcasting range of 55o to 1500 kilocycles , there is room for only 96 channels each io kilocycles wide ; more are needed . The higher the carrier frequency the narrower , relatively , is a band width of ro kilocycles , so hope of increasing the number of available channels lies in the shortwave bands . MANY RADIO MANUFACTURERS are frankly disillusioned about improving the quality of sound reproduced from their radio receivers . Sets of high tone quality are being made , but most radio buyers , it is said , either can not afford or do not want faithful reproduction of fine music , preferring merely sounds which can be used as a background to living . Since the high tones of speech and music interfere with conversation , and since in many households @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , loud-speakers which produce mainly a low " boom , boom " in the background are preferred to those which faithfully reproduce the original music . In the trade jargon , the public has " tin ears . " Such limitations arise , of course , from the rawness of a new and rapidly growing art form , and will tend to disappear in time . The proportion of high-fidelity radio receivers sold is increasing annually , and the quality of broadcast programs improves as public taste educates itself . On the economic side science has taken a hand , for a far better radio receiver can now be bought for twenty dollars than four hundred dollars would buy in 1920 , and a few dollars extra will make it serve as an excellent phonograph . Three hundred dollars will now buy 90 per cent of all that anyone could ask for in a radio , but the lacking io per cent is very expensive , and not all of it is yet , in fact , entirely attainable . Some of the reduction in receiver cost has resulted from mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States were in 1921 only $9,000,000 , by the beginning of World War II they had grown to more than $500,000,000 . But much more of the improvement has arisen from more effective electric circuits , from better vacuum tubes and new ways of using them , and from the research on sound and electrical waves which produced such great improvements in the telephone and the phonograph . A radio receiver , in addition to being a musical instrument , is also unfortunately a piece of furniture and a complex scientific gadget . As a musical instrument it finds its response limited at high frequencies by station-crowding in the wavelength bands , which at present sets a legal upper limit of 5000 cycles , while furniture fashion cuts off the low frequencies by preventing the use of a suitable loud-speaker . Yet  | much has been done to reduce the effect of these limitations . and receivers have been simplified mechanically by making them more complex electrically , so that now a small box of coils and condensers and vacuum tubes is made to control its own sensitivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and even to tune itself automatically . One limitation of ordinary receivers is that by popular demand they attempt to fulfill every radio possibility , and hence do nothing really well . Ninety per cent of all radio listening is to stations not more than ioo miles away , and the requirements for a set suited to these conditions are very different from those of one which is to respond with sensitivity and selectivity to many distant stations . Two stations broadcasting on close-lying frequencies can be separated only by using a receiver of high selectivity , one which can be sharply tuned to respond to only a narrow frequency band . But this operation of itself mars tone quality , for if music is to be reproduced with even average quality the set must be tuned to a band at least 10,000 cycles wide . Therefore high quality receivers are provided with controls which can be adjusted to make them either highly selective , or faithfully responsive to the entire tonal range . Automatic control of sound volume gives an example of how a stream of electrons can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner . Every radio receiver is provided with a knob for adjusting the flow of current to the loud-speaker , which knob controls the output of sound as a faucet controls the output of water from a pipe . But such control is not enough , for a near-by powerful station will produce a torrent of sound , while faint signals from a weak station , or one far away , need greater amplification , and tuning a set would thus require constant adjustment of volume .  | Automatic volume control makes the sound from all stations almost equally loud by constantly varying the sensitivity of the set to give a uniform response to electromagnetic waves of any intensity . Unfortunately the receiver can not distinguish between wanted and unwanted signals , so it may amplify atmospheric cracklings and bangings unduly when it can find no signals to amplify , as when shifting stations . The volume of sound produced is controlled automatically by detouring some of the electrons which come from one of the amplifier tubes , and sending them back to control the sensitivity of an earlier tube . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of electrons , these partially anesthetize the set and cut down its sensitivity . Conversely , if the output current is unusually weak , less current is sent back and the early tubes are allowed to exert themselves to produce maximum sensitivity . The action is similar to that of a steam engine governor , in which the speed of revolution of a pair of balls is made to adjust the throttle to give a constant engine speed , no matter how much power comes from steam in the boiler . The human eye behaves similarly , its control nerves being so adjusted that when the light grows dim , its pupil opens wider . Automatic volume control has made the tuning of a radio receiver less definite , for whereas previously a set was known to be correctly tuned when the sound output was at maximum , now the output level is merely that determined by the hand volume control . The difference between a carefully tuned and a poorly tuned set can then only be judged by the quality of the sound received , and quality , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily judged than volume . Tuning by eye has therefore been introduced to supplement tuning by ear , with small cathode ray tubes ?  | called " magic eyes " ? being arranged to blink ( i.e. , to narrow a beam of electrons striking a fluorescent screen ) when tuning is exact . A further development is push-button tuning . Just as a steel ball , if dropped into an egg cup , will roll into the exact center of the cup , so a receiving circuit can be arranged to pull itself into exact synchronism with an incoming oscillation . Someone must of course decide which of a whole row of egg cups the ball is to be dropped into , so an electric motor is arranged to bring the set roughly into tune with any desired station when the proper button is pressed , and the set then pulls itself into exact synchronization . To reduce noise from static while changing stations , the amplifier response is automatically deadened until the set is correctly tuned . Sound can be compressed for shipment just as hay is baled ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expansion of volume . A symphony orchestra may produce sounds which cover a range in volume of 1oo,000,000 to 1 . Such volumes can not all be carried undistorted through telephone systems and amplifiers , or impressed on phonograph records , so the volume range is compressed . A sound which is really twice as loud as another may be transmitted as though it were only 1.2 times as loud , to take typical figures , and a sound of intensity 4 , then , is given intensity 1.44 ; 8 becomes 1.73 , and so on . In the receiving set much of the original volume can be restored , the circuit being arranged so that when it receives signals for a sound of intensity 1.73 it automatically produces 8 . The amount of compression and subsequent expansion can be adjusted at will , entirely without moving parts except the facile electrons . The volume range of the usual receiver is only about 1 to 1000 , limited for soft tones by the hum coming from the  | 6o-cycle alternating current which energizes the set , and in loudness by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the amplifier . This i000-fold range in intensity is hardly sufficient , and in sets of high quality has been increased to 10,000 . THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF RADIO can be expected to improve considerably in the future . Improved amplifier tubes should decrease the internal complexity of high-quality receiving sets , and just as 3 vacuum tubes now perform feats which were difficult for i.o a decade ago , so our present 3o-tube highfidelity sets will probably be replaced by 6-tube sets in the future . Television has already markedly influenced the development of improved radio tubes , and can be expected to affect radio greatly . Vacuum tubes of the types ordinarily purchased in stores can not be expected to operate more than 2,000 hours , whereas the larger tubes used in transmitters , on which the demand is much greater , in some cases last as long as 20,000 hours in action . The difference is largely one of cost , and receiver tubes which will last for five years of constant use are obtainable if one will pay for them . Indeed , tubes can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility of making the tubes an integral built-in part of the receiver has been seriously considered . The objection to using inferior tubes arises not so much from the likelihood of their failing completely , since they can be replaced cheaply , as from a gradual decrease in their ability to evaporate electrons , so that the quality of  | sound from a set in which they are used depreciates so slowly that its change is not noticed . Static remains the chief bugaboo of radio , but it must be attacked by indirection , since it is composed of the same stuff as the desired signals themselves , and once mixed with them can not be removed . The most promising methods of attack are chain broadcasting , directional sending and receiving , use of ultra-short waves , and " frequency modulation " or FM which appears particularly hopeful . Professor Edwin H. Armstrong of Columbia University developed this new system of radio transmission . The sounds to be carried by the radio waves are attached to these waves , not in such a way as to vary their amplitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such a way as to vary their frequency of oscillation . This corresponds to singing a tone ( the carrier wave ) and then making it go up and down in pitch rather than making it louder and softer . The resulting freedom from static is paid for by a sacrifice in bands available for broadcasting ; for many times the amplitude modulation ( AM ) band width is needed , so fewer broadcasting channels are available . For this reason stations which are now broadcasting with FM use very short waves . An alternative to chain broadcasting , which will become increasingly useful as sound recording methods improve , is to record a program and send out several hundred records to as many stations , to be broadcast as desired . This insures that only a perfected version of the program will be used , which is desirable so long as human performers remain fallible . Many weekly broadcast features are now distributed by record instead of over wires , and the number of " electrically transcribed " programs can be expected to increase greatly .  | Though broadcasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most familiar , other applications are of equal or greater importance . Radio-telephony is especially important in aviation for automatic methods of communication , of direction-finding , and of blind-landing control . Police shortwave radio is having important results in the control of crime . Weather prediction is being facilitated by data obtained with balloons sent aloft to transmit by radio what they find in the upper reaches of the atmosphere . Radio-telegraphy is still used for long-distance communication more than is radio-telephony , for the dots and dashes find their way through static more easily than do words , and a narrower channel of frequencies suffices for their transmission . Pictures are being sent by radio as well as by wire ; and television , which requires a chapter of its own , will also be found utilizing these electromagnetic waves to which our eyes are blind , but for detection of which the physicist has provided an artificial sense .  | EYES THAT SEE THROUGH ATOMS That men may scan the record of each flame .. . E. C. STEDMAN THERE exist a few scientific instruments which , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new factories , and are never sold over the counter , are nevertheless of tremendous importance to science and industry , for without them many of the techniques which man has found most useful would not be available . One of the most powerful of these instruments is the spectroscope ; indeed , Henry Norris Russell has called the spectroscope the Master Key of Science . It appears to be true that with this talented instrument scientists have succeeded in unlocking more secrets of nature than with any other single device . Though comparatively simple in its structure and operation , the spectroscope gives answers to an incredibly wide variety of questions merely by dissecting a beam of light and separating this into its component colors . Is life possible on Mars ? Ask the spectroscope . Is a certain painter 's illness caused by lead poisoning ? The spectroscope can tell . How much does the core of a helium atom weigh , and how much that distant star ? Does this greenhouse contain the correct amount of carbon dioxide to support plant life ? Of what is the tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an iron atom ? Is this the sweater of the  | burglar who crawled through that broken window ? How hot is the sun ? Thousands of such questions are being asked from time to time , and are being answered correctly with the aid of the spectroscope . Any atom or molecule will emit light if it be struck a hard atomic blow , and all light originates from atoms which have thus been stimulated by heat or electricity . Since any material object ? a star , a drop of blood , a speck of putty ? is composed of atoms , any material object can be induced to emit light by heating it until it becomes an incandescent vapor . The light which is thus emitted carries inevitably in itself many secrets concerning the atoms from which it originated . It is the function of the spectroscope to analyze this light , and thus lay bare these secrets for the eye of science to read . For fifty years physicists have been using spectroscopes to dissect atoms and to study their internal structures . By working out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses , instead of letters and words , numbers representing various characteristics of the light which the atoms emit , the physicist is able to learn the positions of electrons in all varieties of atoms , to learn how the electrons jump about when atoms are emitting or absorbing light , and otherwise to get a very clear picture of the internal behavior of atoms . As this picture has grown clearer ? and it is actually very clear , for despite accusations that the modern picture of the atom is now hazier than ever before , it is the atom which is hazier , not the picture ? the physicist has been able to learn how to handle atoms more efficiently , and can tell scientists in other fields how better to handle them . The chemist finds that a tiny pinch of salt needs more than a bathtub full of water in which to hide from the ferreting  | eye of the spectroscope , and he uses this instrument regularly to detect and measure minute traces of impurities in the materials with which he works . So bright is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal can emit , that a piece of brass the size of a pinhead will serve for a complete determination of the presence or absence of seventy of the chemical elements , and none will be overlooked which is present in an amount as great as one-millionth part of the whole . Indeed , at least ten of the chemical elements were originally discovered with the spectroscope . Atoms which are to be studied with a spectroscope need not be anywhere near it , for the light which they emit can travel a billion miles across space and still deliver up its secrets when captured and analyzed . The astronomer is thus enabled to analyze the materials of distant stars , and has learned that even the farthest visible nebula is composed of the same atoms that we know on earth ? dust similar to dust across the vast stretches of the cosmos . More than three-fourths of the discoveries of modern astronomy have been made with the spectroscope , and no large telescope is considered complete without one as an attachment to sort out the light it gathers . Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it stars and nebulae can be weighed , their temperatures taken , their speeds through space measured , and the courses charted of their lives and deaths . To the biologist and physician also the spectroscope is invaluable , for with it such complicated molecules as those of vitamines and hormones can be studied , and metallic poisons can be detected in the blood long before they accumulate in amounts sufficient to be harmful . If the human body is analyzed down to its constituent elements , almost every kind of atom is found , but many are present in extremely small  | amounts . ' Which are essential to life and which are merely incidental ? For example , little copper is found ; too much copper is poisonous ; yet some copper must be present if life is to continue . How much copper is too much , the spectroscope is helping the physician to determine . The same question must be answered for numerous other kinds of atoms . Drugs also can be studied with the spectroscope . In cases where cocaine poisoning is suspected , a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be diluted and the cocaine content can immediately be determined from its light absorption . To draw enough fluid for chemical analysis might harm the patient . Engineers too find the spectroscope useful . With it they can look inside the cylinder of an engine while this is in operation , and study the burning and explosion of gases and the propagation of pressure in the cylinder . To do this a plug of metal is cut from the top of the engine and a thick window of clear fused quartz is inserted in its place . Through this window comes enough light to enable the user of a spectroscope to establish the temperature of the flame at any instant , and to give analyses of the composition and rate of burning of the fuel . Even in crime detection the spectroscope is useful ; it has had its day in court in a number of lawsuits . In one case , gasoline which exploded in a sewer was traced to one of a dozen filling stations in the neighborhood , from which it might have leaked , by using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sewer absorbed light identically with the brand sold by the station . The " G-men " in their government laboratories use the spectroscope regularly , as do workers in the various state criminological laboratories , though not , however , with particular attention to what one  | paper over-enthusiastically referred to as the " ultra-violent " region of the spectrum . The spectroscope is thus at once a powerful tool for analyzing matter , a super-telescope , and a super-microscope ; a superspeedometer , thermometer , tape-measure , and clock . In each role it exceeds in range and power the more common forms of these devices . This it can do because it attacks fundamentals ; it studies the world and the heavens in terms of the very atoms of which they are made , and these atoms in terms of the energy which is their very life . THE FOUNDATIONS OF SPECTROSCOPY were laid by a twentyfour-year-old boy . One day in 1666 a young student , later to win fame as Sir Isaac Newton , threw the first purposefully produced indoor " rainbow " on the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beam of light which was shining through a round hole in his landlady 's windowshade , and saw that the prism split the white light up into a bright spectrum of colors . By so doing he came breathtakingly close to inventing a spectroscope . If the sunlight had entered through a crack in the shade instead of through a hole , and if Newton had turned his prism so that its base was parallel to this crack , and had inserted a pair of lenses into the beam , he might have noticed dark streaks or lines running across some of the colors on the wall . More than a century elapsed , however , before Joseph von Fraunhofer designed a spectroscope which would separate light into its ultimate purity of color , and observed these dark lines in the spectrum . Despite its tremendous analytical powers , a spectroscope  | is really a simple instrument , and it has no moving parts to wear out . Light to be analyzed is sent into it through a narrow slit , and then passed through a prism or similar device which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lengths . Waves of each particular length are sent in a particular direction , where they can be observed with a small telescope . The lenses in this telescope serve to heap similar waves neatly together in one pile , where they appear as a line of colored light , an image of the spectroscope slit in light of utmost purity . If a neon sign or a mercury lamp be observed through a spectroscope , various sharp spectrum lines can be seen ? red and green and blue and other colors ? with dark spaces between . If light from an incandescent lamp be so analyzed , a complete spectrum is seen , for hot filaments emit light waves of all lengths in the visible range ; and the numerous lines , packed infinitely closely , merge together to form a continuous band of color . The great power of the spectroscope arises from the fact that under sufficient provocation all atoms and molecules emit light , and each of the kinds of atoms which make up our earth ? iron and hydrogen and sodium and more than fourscore others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since light waves are identical with ultra-short radio waves , under proper stimulation every atom becomes in fact a tiny short-wave radio transmitting station . ' When a radio set is tuned to a certain wavelength , a peak of sound intensity is heard if some station is broadcasting on that wavelength ; a spectrum line is a peak of light seen at a certain wavelength because an atom is broadcasting on that wavelength . The millions of atoms in a flame or electric arc broadcast on hundreds of frequencies at the same time , but the  | spectroscope can be tuned to all these wavelengths simultaneously , sorting them out so that all can be observed together without mutual interference . Though the waves which the atoms emit bring no purposeful message , they tell much ; and by literally reading between the lines ( to seven figures , in fact ) , the physicist has been able to deduce many particulars about the atomic world from the broadcasts which originate there . Most important is the identification of sending atoms merely by noting the wavelengths on which broadcasting is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is hearing station WZZZ when he turns the radio dial to 422 meters and hears any sort of noise , merely because WZZZ is the only station which broadcasts on that wavelength which his set will pick up , so a spectroscopist knows that he is looking at light from sodium atoms when he sees the familiar yellow light of the sodium flame , because sodium atoms broadcast on the yellow wavelength 0.5893 micro-meters . ( This is usually written by the spectroscopist 5893 Angstroms ; ten billion Angstroms is almost exactly one meter . ) The spectroscopist can be even surer of his station identification than the radio listener can , for each atom broadcasts not on one wavelength only , but on a whole group of wavelengths . Iron atoms , for example , when made sufficiently hot are found to produce more than 20,000 spectrum lines . All told , more than a million separate spectrum lines have been distinguished ; and most of these have been identified as caused by light which has come from one or another of the various kinds of atoms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two carefully measured lines will serve to identify the atom which emitted them , it thus be-  | comes almost impossible for an atom to mask its identity if its light can be sent through a spectroscope . The patterning of lines in a spectrum is a language which the spectroscopist has gradually learned to read clearly . As the series of irregular black marks on this page conveys certain ideas to a reader , so the unevenly spaced lines in a spectrum convey to the scientist flashes of information ? here is iron , here arsenic , here are lines of copper and lead . Some of the lines are brighter than others , so the light can even be made to tell how many atoms of each kind are broadcasting ? here is a great deal of iron , here a little arsenic , here too much copper in this lead . Since the spectroscope arranges the spectrum lines in order of wavelength , it is not necessary that they be seen in color , and they can therefore be photographed and later identified from their positions on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly used , both because the records thus produced can be studied at leisure , and because many spectrum lines are found in the ultraviolet and infra-red regions where they can not be seen but can be photographed with ease . When a camera is thus used in combination with a spectroscope , the resulting instrument is called a spectrograph . Most small spectrographs contain a prism to split the light which passes through them into its constituent wavelengths , but large instruments use a more powerful device , a scientific light-sieve called the diffraction grating . This is usually a highly polished mirror on which as many as 200,000 sharp parallel scratches have been accurately ruled with the point of a diamond . These narrow scratches , when evenly spaced twenty or thirty thousand to the inch and accurately placed to within a thousandth of the thickness of a hair , sort the  | light waves into spectrum lines without the use of auxiliary lenses . Prisms must be made of transparent material ; glass serves for visible light , but quartz is needed for ultra-violet , and rocksalt or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruled on a mirror has the advantage that , within reason , it can be used with waves of any length . A large diffraction-grating spectrograph requires a vast , vibration-free room to house it , and can throw light into a spectrum stretching a hundred feet around a huge circle . Such instruments are giants compared to the most common spectroscopes , small brass tubes on tripods familiar in elementary science laboratories . The positions of spectrum lines can be determined to within 1/25,000 of an inch , and when such precision is attained the length of the light waves is determined to one part in three million . Since the light waves are themselves only about 1/50,000 of an inch long , their lengths can thus be found to within a few trillionths of an inch ? a billionth of the thickness of a hair . WHEN A SPECTROGRAPH iS used to determine which kinds of atoms are present in a given sample of material , the sample is vaporized and a discharge of electric current is sent through it . The simplest method of accomplishing this is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graphite , and insert into this arc the speck of metal or clot of blood which is to be analyzed , so that it is burned to nothingness . This burning tears the molecules of the material apart , separates them into their constituent atoms , and pounds each atom so  | hard with a deluge of electrons and other atoms that it emits the light which reveals its identity . Suppose that a manufacturer of watches finds that a competitor is using a new hairspring of remarkable quality . This spring must be duplicated or improved on at any cost , but what can it contain that confers on its steel the new temper and elasticity which are so desirable ? If a chemist is to analyze the spring by ordinary means he must buy several dozen watches , extract their tiny springs , and then guess which substances are most likely to be involved , so as to select the proper chemical reactions to carry out . He must dissolve and mix and scrape and weigh his materials with the greatest of care , for one single atom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the watch-spring material may be responsible for conferring the high quality , and these are easily lost in a tiny sample . How much more directly can the problem be attacked with a spectrograph ! Now the chemist need merely strike an electric arc between two pieces of graphite , insert a small section of the spring into the flame , and let the flash of light which results enter his instrument and be recorded . ' When the plate is developed it shows hundreds of spectrum lines , and from these can be selected those which are known to arise from each kind of atom . It is but the work of a few moments to identify lines of iron , copper , chromium , nickel ? all common in springs of one sort or another . But here are some lines which belong to beryllium ? there must be beryllium in the spring ! That no metallurgist or chemist would have guessed that beryllium would improve a hairspring is of no consequence , for the beryllium is there , it is the only new element present , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be burned in the blistering 7000 ?  | F of an electric arc , and if a material can be burned its metallic constituents can be determined with the spectrograph , whether it be a sample of blood from a patient suffering from lead poisoning , a drop of condensed milk thought to contain more than one part of copper in three million parts of milk , or paint from an automobile suspected of having collided with a lamp post . Since it is not necessary to know in advance what kinds of atoms are being looked for , almost every kind of atom can be tested for in one operation . No metal has ever been made so pure that the spectroscope could not find impurities in it . Even the superfine extra-pure i000-proof gold which is the basis of the currencies of many countries is found to contain much atomic dirt under this revealing eye which sees through atoms ; and if the average is like the samples which have thus far been measured at the National Bureau of Standards , dross of various kinds totaling more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world . An entire freight train filled with pig-iron can be tested in a few hours by a spectroscopist dragging electric wires behind him as he proceeds from car to car , carrying a small spectroscope in his hand . Opening a car door he clips a wire to a sample pig , strikes an electric arc between this and a bar of pure iron he carries , and observes the light in the spectroscope . If certain impurity lines are fainter than a standard which his instrument shows , that pig contains sufficiently little impure metal , and he passes to another . By properly selecting samples at random the whole trainload of iron can be tested without bothering to unload it . Amounts of metal so small as to be difficult to detect chemically are often of great biological importance . Why do the livers of scallops concentrate cadmium ? Why do the irises  | of the eyes of cattle more than three years old yield an ash which contains more than fifty per cent barium , a fact true of no other animal ? According to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 per cent of copper , while the colored petals of flowers usually have a lower mineral content than do white specimens of the same species . A little copper is good for the digestion , but too much is not . In areas where many cranberries are grown , sprays have for years been used to kill pests , and the Government at one time feared that the soil might have become so saturated with copper from these sprays that the cranberries might be absorbing more copper than would be good for their consumers . So cranberries , cranberry jelly , cranberry juice , dirt from cranberry bogs , and cranberry stems and leaves were all separately consumed in electric arcs and forced to reveal their copper content to the discerning spectrograph . Fortunately the instrument announced that all was well . Very small amounts of lead or arsenic can do great damage to the human body , and lead poisoning is one of the greatest hazards of industry . Lead fumes are found in some mines , and in storage battery and paint factories . Unless some care is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead in their bodies may slowly rise past the danger point , and once this point is passed the resulting diseases are very difficult to cure . It is therefore important to keep a constant check on the lead content of the blood of such workers . By placing a few drops of blood from a worker in a tiny carbon cup and striking an electric arc to this cup , the blood can be vaporized almost instantly , and any lead atoms present will emit their characteristic light , which can be identified with a spectrograph . This light being recorded on the photo graphic plate , a series of samples of blood containing no lead ,  | but with varying known amounts of lead added to each sample , is burned and has its spectra recorded . The spectroscopist matches the intensities of the lead lines in the worker 's blood with those in some one of the samples whose lead content is known , and thus can measure amounts as little as one atom of lead to a million molecules of blood . If a person be allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a definite , though harmless , increase in the lead content of his blood can often be observed with the spectrograph . Nor is this sensitivity confined only to lead , for any of the other sensitive chemical elements can be determined almost as readily . That two or three parts of aluminum or lead can be detected in ten million parts of lobster or condensed milk may seem unimportant , since such concentrations are below the toxic limits considered dangerous to health . Yet obviously tests on the rapidity with which the internal coating of a can dissolves in foods stored within it can be made easily and quickly when such sensitive methods of detection are available . Chocolate and chewing-gum manufacturers use spectroscopic analysis to insure that the lead content of their products is below the limit set by pure food laws . Has the arsenic and lead been properly removed from sprayed foods before canning ? Is beer kept in cans dissolving anything more from the container than it would if kept in bottles ? The spectroscope gives an easy , sure , and quick means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discover the source of tiny black specks in their spotless white product , producers of bakery equipment who wonder if their new coating compound for pans will contaminate the dough , spark-plug manufacturers who wish to study the effect of  | minute amounts of alkali metals in improving sparking , all finding the spectroscope helpful . Of recent application is the internal branding of manufactured products with hidden spectroscopic marks of identification . If you happen to be the manufacturer of a patented kind of chewing gum , and find that a firm in Mexico is constantly infringing your patents , but you can not prove this in court because the Mexican gum is identical with yours and is put in similar wrappers , the spectroscope can help you . Just get a spectroscopist to determine all the kinds of atoms present in the gum , and then dump into your mixing vats a small quantity of some material containing two or three kinds of atoms not normally found in gum . Only a few grains of material will serve to brand a ton of gum , and this amount , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither the gum nor the chewer thereof . Then in future you can prove that a certain sample of gum which is said to be yours , but contains no tell-tale , is really the Mexican variety ? at least until spectroscopes become more common in Mexico ! WHEN THE SPECTROSCOPIST burns a substance in an electric arc to force it to emit light , the molecules of which it is composed are torn asunder . These molecules consist , of course , merely of groups of atoms clinging together in definite patterns . When vitamins or hormones or other such complex materials are studied , it is the molecules themselves which are of interest , rather than their constituent atoms . Though such materials would be destroyed if burned , fortunately they can be studied with the spectroscope by an entirely different  | method from the one used for detecting atoms ? a method which leaves them entirely undamaged . If a material is at all transparent , light can be sent through it , and waves of certain lengths will be absorbed by its molecules . The spectrograph can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyzing not the light which it receives but that which is missing because absorbed before it enters the spectrograph . Vitamin A , for example , has been found to absorb strongly any light waves which are slightly shorter than violet waves . Therefore , instead of feeding cod-liver oil to rats for weeks to discover how much vitamin A a given sample contains , the standard procedure now is merely to send a beam of ultra-violet light through the oil and measure with a spectrograph the amount of light of wavelength 328o Angstroms which is absorbed by a layer of oil of measured thickness . Care must be taken to dissolve from the cod-liver oil any nonvitamin material which might absorb light waves of the same length ; but such offending impurities can easily be eliminated from the oil by mixing it with chemicals which change them to soap . Analyzing a translucent substance by studying the light it absorbs is particularly convenient because the material is not destroyed , and the method is quick , clean , simple , and accurate . The two questions which any such analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " How much is there of each ? " Light-absorption measurements answer the second question definitely . It is estimated that a layer of material only five atoms thick can in many cases be detected by the light it absorbs . By combining a microscope with a spectroscope a speck of vanadium only ioo atoms long by ioo atoms broad by five atoms thick has been observed . Ability to detect such a clump of matter , containing only 5o,000  | atoms , weighing a billionth of a billionth as much as a dime , stamps this method as one of the most sensitive available . All life ultimately depends on absorption of light , for it is the absorption of sunlight by the green leaves of plants which keeps the plant and animal worlds alive . Biologists have long used the spectroscope in their efforts to learn how the chlorophyll of green leaves manages to capture sunlight , and with its aid store in the leaf carbon from the air as cellulose , starch , and sugar . Many a leaf , green or brown or yellow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had its inner structure plumbed with light in an effort to unravel the secrets of chlorophyll and carotin and other complex molecules on which life depends . IN THE ULTRA-SHORT WAVE REGION OF THE SPECTRUM lies a broad band of waves entirely untouched except by the pioneering surveys of spectroscopists studying the spectrum for its own sake . Such useful applications of these waves as there may be ? and there will probably be many ? must wait until further experiments have been performed , experiments designed to perfect ways of handling these delicate rays . No one has yet succeeded in finding a solid material which is transparent to light waves shorter than one-fourth as long as those we call violet , and longer than X-rays , and which could be used for windows to allow light to enter and leave experimental apparatus . Thus far hydrogen and helium are the only materials which the ultra-short light waves have been found able to penetrate . If , however , we pass in thought to the region of still shorter wavelengths ? to electromagnetic waves less than one-thou-  | sandth as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again on familiar ground , for we have now reached the domain of the X-rays . X-rays require special kinds of spectroscopes for their study , but these have now been developed to a high state of perfection and are in everyday use to explore the hidden depths of matter . Sir William Crookes might have discovered X-rays if he had been less efficient and more curious . One day , as Crookes was sending an electric current through a glass tube from which he had pumped most of the air , he noticed that a box of photographic plates left near the tube became fogged when the current was flowing , even though the box was not open . He found that the mysterious fogging could be cured by removing the wrapped plates from the room whenever the electric current was flowing . He was so interested in the tube itself that when he found how to cure the incidental fogging of the plates he concerned himself no further with its cause . A few years later ( 1895 ) Professor ' Wilhelm Konrad Roentgen was doing similar experiments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , found that unopened boxes of plates were fogged when the tube was in operation . Fortunately Roentgen was not satisfied merely to protect his plates ; he set out to find just why they became fogged . It did not take him long to learn that the fogging was produced when a mysterious green glow appeared in the tube , a glow which Crookes also had noticed . Roentgen soon found that a new type of ray , which he named the X-ray , was coming from the walls of the tube , and that it could pass through any box and paper in which the plates might be wrapped , and also through any books or even his hand inserted between the tube and the plates . Thus simply were these new rays discovered , rays soon to prove so great a boon  | to humanity as a tool of both pure and applied science , and though destined to take dozens of lives , destined also to save millions . The green glow which Crookes and Roentgen saw was light being emitted by the glass walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time these electrons , or cathode rays , were stimulating the atoms of the glass to emit other waves of extremely short length , and these were the X-rays . Physicists have since found that X-rays are produced when electrons strike any atoms at high speed , and vice versa , that when X-rays strike atoms , electrons are hurled out . An X-ray tube is a lamp designed to emit electromagnetic waves of extremely short length . Such tubes , seen in all hospitals and in many dentists ' offices , consist of an evacuated bulb containing as perfect a vacuum as can conveniently be produced , and fitted with metal electrodes to which high voltage can be applied . Electrons released from a hot filament are pulled through the vacuum by the high voltage until they reach speeds of thousands of miles per second ; at these dizzy velocities they are slammed against atoms of tungsten or some such heavy material , and as each electron strikes it splashes out a spurt of X-rays . The higher the voltage applied to an X-ray tube the faster are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shorter-waved and more penetrating are the X-rays produced . By using giant tubes which will stand millions of volts , X-rays can be produced which will go through several feet of concrete with ease . The technique of handling X-rays is still very crude ; we have no lenses to bend them , no mirrors to reflect them properly , no microscopes to see with them . In spite of these  | lacks , two powerful methods of using X-rays have been discovered . The first is to take shadow pictures with them , such as have revolutionized medicine and surgery . The second is to send the X-rays through a special type of spectroscope which contains , instead of a diffraction grating , crystals of the material to be studied . Shadow pictures show very little detail , but they show enough to locate an open safety pin in a child 's throat , or a bullet hiding in a splintered bone . As they have become cheaper to produce and control , shadowgraph pictures are finding increased use in industry . Every box of candy sent out from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by consumers who might bite on or swallow metallic foreign bodies . X-rays can be used to show whether eggs are good or bad ; golf-balls are regularly X-rayed for symmetry of their centers , and airplane parts for worm holes and hidden knots . Metal castings can be inspected for internal flaws by the shadow-picture method , and high-pressure boilers and pipes are often X-rayed to insure that they contain no weak spots which might later cause explosions . REVEALING AS IS THE GLIMPSE through flesh or metal which an X-ray shadow picture gives , it is crude compared to that obtained by means of an X-ray spectrograph . Then the glimpse is into the very atoms of matter themselves ? even farther into the hearts of these atoms than is possible with an ordinary spectrograph . In 1912 Dr. Max von Laue had the brilliant idea that a crystal , such as rocksalt or diamond , might separate X-rays  | into beams of similar wavelength much as an ordinary diffraction grating separates light into its colors . The diffraction grating consists of thousands of parallel lines traced on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of millions of parallel lines of atoms , very close together , and perhaps these closely spaced lines are just what is needed to sort out the short-waved X-rays . Experiments carried out at von Laue 's suggestion showed that his idea was a good one . When a narrow beam of X-rays was sent through a crystal , dark spots appeared on a photographic film held behind the crystal , and the positions of these spots were found to depend on the different wavelengths in the X-ray beam , and on the arrangements of the atoms in the crystal . Sir William Bragg and Professor W. L. Bragg soon were able to arrange the crystal in a spectrograph so that clear , sharp , spectrum lines , entirely similar to those produced when visible or ultra-violet light is sent through an ordinary spectrograph , were obtained with X-rays . If X-rays are sent through a piece of metal , the small crystals of which the metal is composed can be studied with the X-ray spectrograph . This use of X-rays has particular application in the heat treatment of steel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep certain metal parts for six hours in a furnace at high temperature in order to bring them to the desirable strength and hardness . The arrangement of crystals in the metal was studied , and the realignment of the atoms and crystals during heat treatment was watched with an X-ray spectroscope . As a result it became possible to work out theoretically a special short course of treatment lasting only half an hour . On trial this proved to give better results than the longer treatment , and at onefifth the cost .  | Pieces of metal which undergo great stress , such as airplane propellers , show changes in their internal structure some time before they are ready to break . Propellers are almost always X-rayed by the shadow method to discover internal flaws , but they should also be studied from time to time with the X-ray spectroscope to insure that their atoms show no signs of wanting to let go of each other . Most up-to-date textile plants and metallurgical laboratories possess X-ray equipment . How well a piece of cloth will wear depends on the quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how strong and flexible these fibers will be depends greatly on the character of the molecules of which they are composed . The X-ray spectroscope can be used to look right down through the fiber structure into the arrangements of atoms in these molecules ; and sometimes it shows that improved arrangements of atoms would make better molecules , hence sturdier fibers , hence stronger cloth . In cotton , wool , and asbestos fibers the molecules are found to consist of long strings of atoms lying side by side ; here are substances respectively of vegetable , animal , and mineral origin which are similar in molecular and in outer form . Mica is composed of molecules which form broad flat crystalline plates arranged in layers which are held together so loosely that they can be split apart without difficulty . In diamond , on the other hand , carbon atoms hold strongly to each other in three dimensions to form crystals which can not be torn or split , and hence produce the hardest substance known . But change the arrangement of these atoms ever so little and groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes , and instead of the hard abrasive diamond , we have graphite , one of the most slippery solids known when wet .  | If a piece of rubber is held between an X-ray tube and an X-ray spectrograph , the spectrum shows that so long as the rubber remains unstretched the molecules in it are arranged helter-skelter with no semblance of order . But when the rubber is stretched long chains of molecules appear , which contract and expand like coiled springs . The unusual ability of rubber to stretch and then return to its original shape can be traced directly to the molecules of which it is composed . An important problem of an industrial age is lubrication . About this the X-ray spectroscope gives useful information , for it shows that greases and oils contain long molecules which slide over one another in layers , like eels which attach themselves to metal surfaces by their heads and then let their long bodies slither freely over one another . The spectroscope is one of the instruments which is helping scientists to overcome the limitations resulting from the specialization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in different fields find the understanding of each other 's problems increasingly difficult , but mutual interest in a powerful tool does much to furnish common ground . Now astronomers , botanists , biologists , chemists , geologists , metallurgists , physicists , and workers in almost every other natural science and in many industries find their need of spectrographic methods helping them to a better understanding of mutual problems . Even more important , the spectrograph furnishes the only available means of solving many of these problems .  | THE DOCTOR AND THE PHYSICIST Wisdom crieth without . . . Length of days is in her right hand . Proverbs THE wonders which medical workers have already brought about in the diagnosis and treatment of disease suggest that a time may come when the physician will be able to analyze most illnesses as soon as they start , and cure them before damage results . How soon this " golden age of healing " arrives will depend greatly on how close is the collaboration between research workers in medicine and those who work in the sciences on which medicine depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curative drugs , and on the physicist for diagnostic instruments and healing rays . In the one field new materials and in the other new devices are being produced in increasing numbers , helping to make imminent new miracles of medicine . The X-ray and the microscope have extended the vision of the medical observer until he can see through ten inches of living flesh or into a single tissue cell , yet similar but much more powerful tools still await development . Modern electrical devices enable him to listen to faint murmurings of the life processes , or to measure feeble currents arising from heart and brain and nerve ; yet electrical body measurements are but little understood . Now newly discovered atomic rays are being brought to help him destroy malignant invaders of the  | human system , and there is every reason to believe that even more important curative rays await discovery . Much of the aid which physics gives to medicine is of a deliberate sort : Here is a job to be done , says medicine ; This is how to do it , says physics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between medical life-saving and some of the apparently impractical fundamental researches of the modern physicist . X-rays and radium , which have saved thousands of lives in the few years they have been available , are two early examples . Today , discoveries are being made which promise to be even more fruitful in their turn . The X-ray , as we have seen , was stumbled on by Roentgen , a physicist , who had no inkling that the outcome of his experiments would prove so fruitful in relieving human suffering . Yet it would be incorrect to say that X-rays became available to mankind as the result of an accident . As well say that the sportsman landing a giant tarpon off the coast of Florida made his catch by accident because he could not predict in advance exactly what sort of fish he would hook . Most great experimental discoveries are made in a similar way . The accident , if such it must be called , is a planned accident , which could never occur if the scientist did not place himself in position for the lightning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each year in the United States , but there is hope that eventually this number can be greatly reduced . During a recent year 76 per cent of the cancer patients in the principal hospitals in England were treated by radiation from X-ray tubes and from radium . The ray treatment would be far more effective than it is if only unhealthy cells were affected , but since to reach internal cancers the rays must first traverse normal tissue , where they produce  | electron bullets which fly in all directions , an undesirable number of healthy cells may be killed . Rays are wanted which will be more penetrating . Even if radium could always be used effectively there is not enough radium in the world to fill the present need . Only about two pounds ? roughly $18,000,000 worth ? is now available , and even this much radium , if gathered together and applied to one patient , would hardly be sufficient to treat some of the deep-seated malignancies which are found . Much comfort can therefore be derived from the knowledge that new super-giant X-ray tubes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce rays that will out-radiate radium . For bombarding malignant growths X-ray tubes are needed which will stand much higher voltages than those used for X-ray picture taking . Cancers on the surface of the body can be treated with X-rays produced'at ioo , 000 to zoo , 000 volts , but a malignancy which lies deeper may require rays from tubes which operate on much higher voltages . The principal rays from radium are equivalent to those from an X-ray tube running on only two million volts . Since the immediate plans of the atom-smashers call for tubes which will stand hundreds of millions of volts , medical investigators naturally have a weather-eye cocked to watch their success . Several large hospitals in the United States now possess X-ray tubes to which a million volts or so can be applied safely . Some of these great tubes are twice the height of a man , and each of them will furnish rays in quantity equivalent to those given out by more than two pounds of radium ? $18,000,000 worth . Mere interest payments on the investment in so much radium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment . Yet the power to operate the most  | efficient of these giant X-ray outfits for an hour costs less than thirty cents . A three-million-volt X-ray tube of the type which has been built for atom-smashing can readily be applied to medical purposes . Since such a tube produces not only more rays but more useful rays than those of any obtainable amount of radium , deeper-lying tumors can be reached with its aid , and treatment times greatly shortened . Such an X-ray outfit costs less than many a sportsman 's toy . " Millions of volts " sounds rather alarming to a patient ; but danger from electric shock has been completely eliminated in these giant tubes . All dangerous and scientific-looking gadgets can be kept bottled up in a room into which no one need go while the apparatus is running . The X-rays can be sent through the bottom of the tube into a room below , where the patient reclines comfortably amid attractive surroundings during the short periods required for treatment . Some doctors believe that high-speed electrons may turn out to be even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The faster an electron moves the less does it affect tissue through which it passes , just as a fast bullet breaks a cleaner hole through a pane of glass than does a slow one . High-speed electrons might then be expected to affect less the healthy tissue cells in the first part of their paths , and to do most of their desired destructive work on the diseased cells at the end of their flight , like shells with fuses set to explode in the enemy 's trenches . However , much higher voltages than have been available previously will be required to generate electrons with sufficient speed to replace X-rays for cancer treatment . Electron rays from a three-million-volt tube are useful , but ten-million-volt electron rays would  | probably be better . The atom-splitting physicists are now able to provide these . RADIUM IS THE BEST-KNOWN RADIOACTIVE ELEMENT , but the radium atom is only one of forty kinds of atoms found in nature which are unstable and which will eventually , at some unpredictable time , explode . When an atom explodes it ejects an electron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atom ) out of its nucleus at high speed , and also emits some penetrating gamma rays . These rays are identical with X-rays , and are of great value to the physician for destroying malignant cells . As far as he is concerned , a vial of radium is merely a very convenient and portable , but extremely expensive , twomillion-volt X-ray outfit . Before 1896 atoms were supposed to be the ultimate indivisible building stones of matter , and no one dreamed that they could be pulled to pieces , much less that some of them would occasionally blow up of their own accord . In that year the French physicist , Henri Becquerel , was experimenting with the radiant glow that appears on certain minerals when they are struck with light . Because it happened to be foggy in Paris for several days , and no sunlight was available for his experiments , Becquerel left some photographic plates in a drawer with a bit of the mineral , which was presumably not glowing . When he developed the plates he found them fogged . It appeared that illumination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the mineral had been glowing spontaneously . The glow was ultimately found to result from a combination of two minerals ? one which be-  | came luminous when struck by rays , and another which was constantly emitting rays of its own accord . These rays , it developed , were produced by the disintegration of certain atoms in the mineral ; thus radioactivity was discovered . As all the world knows , Pierre and Marie Curie later were able to concentrate the substance whose atoms were disintegrating in a portion of the material which Becquerel had been using ; and this turned out to be a new element , radium . Radium has had wide use in the treatment of malignancies , but unfortunately , as a result of the many cures associated with it , the word radium has come to have magical significance , and tonic remedies containing radium have had wide sale as nostrums , some of which are extremely dangerous . The rays from radium are useful , but to use these safely the radium which produces them must be placed where it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If radium is eaten , drunk in radioactive water , or breathed into the lungs with air , it tends to be deposited in the bones and begins a slow poisoning process which will be fatal if enough radium is present . Though radium is extremely expensive , ten cents ' worth is enough to kill a man if it gets into his bones . Eating five dollars ' worth or breathing fifty cents ' worth of radium salts will accomplish this . As little as one ten-millionth of an ounce of radium deposited in the bones has been found to cause death within ten years . Fortunately many of the so-called radioactive waters which are sold as medicine contain a negligible amount of radium and are harmless , though their value may be open to question . However , there are some which do contain radium in relatively large quantities , and these are slow but deadly poison . A few unfortunates who have drunk " radium waters " have found themselves apparently improving in health for a  | time , presumably as the result of a stimulating irritation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the radium has become fixed in the body , a poisoning process of a particularly horrible kind may set in , for the radium atoms lodge in the bones and from this vantage place can bombard the cells of the body to death . Radium is chemically like the calcium from which bones are made , and the unsuspecting blood stream willingly deposits radium atoms wherever calcium atoms are needed for building purposes . Soon the deception becomes apparent , however , for previously healthy bones , attacked from within , begin to fester and decay . Even after an atom of radium has exploded , the damage it can do is not complete , for it changes into an atom of radon which can again explode , and over and over the same atom , like a six-ball Roman candle , can shoot out its violently destructive rays . It is of no use to wait for all the radium atoms which have been taken into the body to explode , for only half of them will have done so by the end of 1690 years . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this can be done more readily if it be attempted soon after they have been absorbed . In a number of cases of radium poisoning , it has been found possible literally to rinse some of the dangerous atoms out of the patient 's bones . First he is given a medical treatment which causes his bones to lose calcium , and , as the calcium departs , some of the radium is forced out with it , in keeping with its masquerade as calcium . The patient is kept in bed , and before his bones are appreciably softened the treatment is reversed and the body is encouraged to take up fresh clean calcium to rebuild them . When they are again sound the first procedure can be repeated . This rinsing process can be carried out again and again until the patient improves ,  | The closest co-operation between physician and physicist is necessary for such treatment . The physicist is needed to make delicate measurements with sensitive detectors which tell , at every instant , just how much radium still remains in the various parts of the patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath , and how much through his other eliminative processes . Such control of the treatment is made possible only by the sensitive instruments which have recently been developed for research on cosmic rays , on atomsplitting , and on radioactivity . Measurements made with them cause no discomfort to the patient , as their extreme sensitivity makes possible measurements on the radium content of his body by means of a detector placed as much as a yard away . To achieve such sensitivity all the resources of modern vacuum-tube amplifiers must be invoked , and to them must be added other tricks which have been developed to pick up the tiny burst of energy which is freed when a single atom explodes . A pebble from a slingshot can explode a percussion cap , which in turn can explode enough dynamite to blow up a mountain . Likewise , the energy of the exploding atom can be turned cunningly into channels which will produce an electrical result which is cataclysmic in comparison with the cause which touched it off . So sensitive have these instruments been made that they record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the concrete of which not more than one atom in a thousand billion is radioactive . Small wonder that they will detect the presence of less than one cent 's worth of radium in the human body . While such instruments were developed primarily forstudying atomic processes , their medical application is obvious . One can easily imagine the joy of a patient suffering  | from incipient radium poisoning when the instruments show that as a result of a course of special treatments he is eliminating radium eight times as fast as previously , and that the amount of radium left in his body is gradually being lowered to a safe level . THE CREATION OF NEW KINDS OF ATOMS iS commonly supposed to have been quite thoroughly completed some years ago , whether in 4004 B.C. or long before pre-Cambrian days . As this is written , however , atoms of varieties never before found are being artificially produced in physical laboratories throughout the world at a rate almost too fast to follow . Youths with cheeks still downy , who but a few years ago were struggling through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new building blocks of the universe . These discoveries are producing profound effects on chemistry and medicine . The physicist has ' succeeded in permanently changing one kind of material into another kind ? true transmutation of the elements ? by bombarding ordinary matter with atomic bullets . But the new atoms which result from a transmutation were , until the advent of the atomic bomb , of little interest except from an academic standpoint . Far more important are the new varieties of temporary atoms which have been found to be produced as an intermediate step . These atoms are mortal , man-made , not in nature 's plan . Such temporary atoms duplicate the atoms of chemistry , but show surprising properties of instability . They may last but an hour , a day , or a month , and are like ghosts allowed to walk the earth but briefly , after which they must depart .  | They are much more real than ghosts while they last , however , for no chemist can distinguish them from their normal counterparts . Only deep within their hearts do they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the tiny atomic cataclysm which results can be picked up by sensitive detectors which record the minute explosion as surely as an earthquake recorder will mark the explosion of a ton of dynamite . Since these tricky atoms are chemically indistinguishable from normal atoms of the same material , they can be used as atomic spies to follow the movements of swarms of normal atoms with which they can be mixed . The airplane machine gunner finds advantage in having every tenth bullet a tracer which leaves a track of smoke behind it and so marks the path of all the bullets ; in the same way the chemist and the biologist , to say nothing of workers in other sciences , are finding tracer atoms effective . Mixing undetected with their fellow atoms , these behave normally until the hour of its inevitable explosion arrives for each . Then , like an Oriental spy sworn to self-immolation , each reveals its presence as it is destroyed and so betrays the location of its atomic comrades . The explosion which marks the demise of such a temporary atom results , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveling as fast as four hundred million miles an hour ? fast enough to encircle the earth three times while one snaps a finger . Such an electron is for all practical purposes identical with one produced in a million-volt vacuum tube . Gamma rays , equivalent to the X-rays from a high-voltage tube , are also emitted by the exploding atom . These two sorts of rays we have already seen to be of great medical importance . Now some patients who need treatment with X-rays or electrons  | need no longer rest under a gigantic tube , for some ordinary table salt or other suitably chosen harmless material can be exposed for a few minutes to rays from such a tube , can thus be made artificially radioactive , and can then be applied to the proper spot on the patient . Exact dosage is made easy , for only as many radioactive atoms are produced in the salt as are needed , and if the material is left on the patient too long no harm results , most of the atoms having already exploded . Another feature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that suggested by the concentration of iodine by the thyroid gland . Some physicians who have worked on the problem believe that when iodine is fed to a patient , practically all of it is concentrated in the thyroid gland within twenty-five minutes . Radioactive iodine atoms can be made by bombarding iodine with protons , the hearts of ordinary hydrogen atoms . If such activated iodine mixed with ordinary iodine is fed to a patient , the physician is able to follow the course of all the iodine atoms through his system by counting the atomic explosions which will be registered on various detectors placed in suitable positions around him . Now suppose that a , patient has a malignant disease of the thyroid gland which needs radioactive treatment . The radioiodine atoms emit rays which are quite as effective as those of radium , and the bombarding atoms should be carried in the blood directly to the spot where they are needed . Exactly the proper amount of radio-iodine , costing only a few cents to produce in one of the new atom-splitting machines , could then be given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploded and has done its minute bit of cell blasting , the proper treatment would have been completed . As each radio-iodine atom disintegrates it changes to xenon , an  | absolutely inert gas which is harmlessly carried off in the blood stream . Biologists have always been interested in determining how phosphorus is utilized by various parts of the living body . Chemical methods of attacking this problem have a drawback in that it is necessary to destroy the tissue to analyze its contents , a procedure which may be impossible except in the case of certain parts which the patient can readily spare , such as fingernails or hair . Radio-phosphorus now enables biologists to investigate this problem without destroying tissue . Atoms of radio-phosphorous last two weeks on the average before they blow up . Inconceivably small quantities can be fed to a patient ? in a radioactive lemon phosphate ! Is phosphorus a brain food ? Hold the detecting instrument near the patient 's head and count the clicks . Do teeth grow , and do they use phosphorus atoms ? Do n't bother to pull a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how many atomic explosions occur . With electrons and protons , deuterons , and even heavier atomic particles available to be hurled against each of the more than four hundred sub-varieties of atoms which the physicist has found included among the ninety elements of the chemist , dozens of new kinds of useful temporary atoms doubtless remain to be discovered . Already nearly two hundred new varieties of temporary atoms have been produced by physicists in the course of atomic transmutations , and it seems probable that every known element can be produced in one or two temporary radioactive forms . Some have already been created in four or five forms . As higher speeds for atomic bullets are achieved , increasing numbers of new super-chemical reactions should be found . That one kind of atom can be changed into another by  | striking its nucleus with an atomic bullet was discovered in 1918 by Sir Ernest Rutherford . That new atoms so formed are often unstable , and hence radioactive , was first observed in 1933 by Irene and Frederic Curie-Joliot , daughter and sonin-law of the Curies who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other atoms . This method is still used to some extent , but greater yields of the radioactive atoms can be obtained by using one of the new atom-smashing machines which have been developed to make atomic particles move with high speeds . Two such devices have been particularly successful , one the cyclotron developed by Dr. Ernest O. Lawrence and his collaborators at the University of California , and the other the electrostatic generator which produces high voltages which can be applied to great vacuum tubes , developed by Dr. Robert J. Van de Graaff and his coworkers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . Several dozen of each of these devices for producing artificial radioactivity are now in operation or in process of construction in America and Europe . The electrostatic generator , already mentioned in connection with the transmission of power , uses the static machine principle , modified and dressed up in modern form to produce voltages hundreds of times greater than those produced by ordinary static machines . The forte of the static machine , used so long in doctors ' offices to titillate the skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been to produce a great deal of voltage without much current , and this is just what is needed to operate giant vacuum tubes . In the cyclotron , atomic bullets of any one of three or four varieties are swung in circular orbits of constantly increasing diameter , just as David in his encounter with Goliath whirled a stone around his head by means of a leather sling .  | A huge magnet is used to keep the particles circling in the proper orbits within an evacuated chamber , and carefully timed electrical impulses keep them swinging around ever faster and faster until they finally emerge at high speeds . Important new atom-smashing devices which have grown from the cyclotron are the betatron , developed by Professor D. W. Kerst of the University of Illinois , and the synchrotron , to which a number of physicists have contributed and which is still in the process of development . The betatron and synchrotron are especially designed to accelerate electrons to high speeds . With a huge synchro-cyclotron at the University of California , particles have been speeded up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and have then been found to produce mesons artificially . The uranium pile , discussed in detail in Chapter XVII , is a powerful source of nuclear rays and of artificially radioactive elements which act as portable sources of useful nuclear radiations . Especially are such piles valuable sources of neutrons , which can be produced in such numbers that with them gold can be transformed into mercury and almost any atom into several others , in quantities which can be weighed , packaged , and sold in commerce . LIGHT , IN ADDITION TO BEING USEFUL FOR SEEING , has its own curative effects . Some physicians consider sunlight the greatest of all healing agencies , but sunlight is not always available . Lamps have now been developed which can be made to radiate not only waves of every one of the visible and in-  | visible colors which the sun sends us , but others as well which were never known before . Many of these new light rays are found to have definite germ-killing or curative properties , while others have not yet been tested for possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physicist has developed to study the structure of matter , and the relationships of matter and energy , have proved very useful in separating light into its component parts for medical use . When a beam of white light produces a curative or stimulating effect , there is always the possibility that only the blue or the red light contained in the white beam was responsible for the effect . When the basic colors have been separated and tried individually , sometimes one color has been found partially to offset effects produced by another ? a greater effect being produced by a part of the light than by all of it . The same long-waved ranginess which enables infra-red rays to penetrate haze for great distances serves the physician well , for it enables these rays to get through layers of skin and fat and thus reveal anomalies of underlying tissues . The sinuses and other body parts , which can often be usefully studied by sending ordinary light through them and looking for shadows , can be penetrated , even better with the longer invisible waves . Heating lamps are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skin into the underlying tissue where they soothe cramped muscles and tired nerves . Their application increases the flow of blood , and is said to be beneficial in neuralgic and arthritic conditions . The effects of light of various colors on mold spores have been strikingly shown by covering a flat plate of glass with gelatin soaked with some jelly-like material which becomes moldy easily . The plate was planted uniformly with the  | spores , and was then exposed to the light of the spectrum ; long infra-red rays fell on one end of the plate , then came the rainbow array of visible colors , and finally the spectrum of invisible ultra-violet rays falling on the other end . After a short exposure to this complete spectrum , the plate was put in a warm place where any spores which were left alive might multiply and prosper . A few days later the spores were found to have photographed their own death records , for in regions exposed to light of colors which would kill the spores the plate was clear , while in other regions the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted growth , and , with some waves , even stimulated it . The curative value of sunlight for various serious skin diseases has long been known . Remarkable cures have also been made by focusing on the skin by means of quartz lenses the light from powerful electric lamps . Ultra-violet light kills germs , but in the early experiments the skin was sometimes badly burned while the germs were being killed . Fortunately the rays that did the burning and those that killed the germs were not the same , and it was found possible to filter out the former by sending the light a short distance through water . When the tiny organisms which produce many diseases are watched under a microscope while they are illuminated with ultra-violet light , they can be seen to curl up and die . Shortwave ultra-violet rays are especially deadly to most germs , and ultra-violet lamps which emit germ-killing invisible rays are being increasingly installed in surgical operating rooms . If a beam of this invisible light be allowed to shine in one end of a solid rod of fused quartz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rod for many inches , practically without diminution . Such transparent rods are now quite commonly used  | to pipe healing and disinfecting radiations into various passages of the body . Much of the milk that is sold today is " ultra-violet rayed . " In large creameries the milk is made to flow from a tank in a thin sheet , and bright batteries of mercury arcs shine germkilling ultra-violet light all through it . In some large bakeries , loaves of bread and even cakes , of which almost one in seven were formerly lost through spoilage , are now exposed to ultraviolet light from special lamps for a few seconds , with the result that less than one in fifty becomes moldy . The effects of sterilizing meat in this way are also being studied . Production of vitamin D is closely linked to light , and it is no longer necessary to rely on the ability of the codfish to store in his liver the energy of sunlight which has been gathered up by the salt-water algae on which have fed the small fish which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlled conditions , the vitamin can be concentrated far more effectively than by any codfish . The medical use of light has met with such a popular response that many fads have developed , some of which have been carried to an extreme . Indiscriminate exposure of large areas of the body to intense light may do much more harm than good . What is needed is more really scientific study of the effects of light of different colors , both visible and invisible , on human physiology and psychology . For the development of the light-emitting , the light-analyzing , and the light-measuring devices still needed for this purpose , medicine looks to the physicist .  | THE WHIRLING FORCE which causes a youngster to cling so tightly to the neck of his wooden horse on a merry-go-round , and the ticket-taker of the carrousel to lean inward at such a precarious angle as he makes his rounds , comes effectively to the assistance of medicine in the separation of viruses too delicate to handle otherwise . Mud will settle from murky water merely on standing , but the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substance like honey . Centrifugal forces which pull more strongly than gravity can be used to speed the separation of the mud from the honey merely by whirling the mixture in a circle . If a mixture be whirled two thousand times in a second , a force several hundred thousand times its own weight will gently but compellingly urge each particle toward the outside of its container . Such a pull will quickly separate blood cells from the serum in which they float . A grain of wheat whirled in a tiny circle at so giddy a rate behaves as though it weighed more than fifty pounds . Small rotating tops have recently been developed which will spin a tiny vial of biological serum at speeds up to a milIion revolutions a minute . To attain such speeds , friction must be reduced to a minimum , and the top , as it spins , touches nothing solid but is balanced in a whirling jet of air . The limitation which prevents attainment of still higher speeds is the difficulty of getting materials which will stand the great forces involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terrific pull in its own substance . Yet even at the highest practicable speeds , a flashing light has been ar-  | ranged to make the whirling tube seem to stand still , and an observer , looking through a microscope , has calmly watched a cell being pulled apart while it whirled under his nose at more than three hundred miles an hour . Mechanics , as exemplified in the centrifuge , is the oldest branch of physics ; but what of electricity , one of the newest ? The body probably has more electric currents flowing through it than a telephone switchboard , but most of these currents are weak and difficult to measure , and the body is poorly equipped with electrical terminals . Variations in health and in the tone of various organs are undoubtedly reflected in changes of these currents , but as yet electrical methods of diagnosis have been but slightly developed . How tired a person feels and his general state of health seem to be tied up in some mysterious fashion with differences between the resistance of his body to the passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just why this relationship exists , and how it can be used , are as yet not apparent . In the treatment of disease the position of electricity is more secure . The electric knife has caused great progress in surgery . High-frequency alternating current is sprayed into the tissue from the edge of the knife , and as the tissue is cut the edges of the wound are electrically disinfected and seared , a process which reduces bleeding and promotes healing . In brain operations the radio knife has been found especially useful , for with it electric current can be sent through tumors to shrivel and destroy them , and the dried tissue can be removed through small openings in the skull . In cancer operations this knife may give greater safety , for cancerous cells which might be set free for distribution through the body in the blood stream can be killed by the heat and current , and the ends of the blood vessels which might carry them  | off are seared shut . The radio knife is operated by means of alternating current of very high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which made radio-telegraphy possible . Only in recent years have doctors come to realize that a fever may be not the result of an illness but an attempt of the body to cure the illness . Many kinds of germs die at temperatures slightly above normal body temperatures . Doctors have even inoculated patients with malaria germs to produce intermittent fevers ? the malaria was less disagreeable and easier to cure than the original disease . When it is found that a vacuum tube can produce just as good a fever as a malaria germ , with no malaria to be cured afterward , there is cause for rejoicing . The heat generated by high-frequency currents first became noticeable when radio men who were working near highpower oscillating tubes developed temporary fevers . After all , if the insides of vacuum tubes could be heated white hot by such means , why could the insides of a patient not be warmed to a lesser degree ? Listing the contributions of physics to the new medicine could be continued almost indefinitely . Tiny super-candid cameras which , with their own lights attached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snap a number of views of the inside of his stomach before they are fished up again ; electrical speedometers invented specifically to measure cosmic rays but which immediately are found useful to count the rapid heartbeats of a rat ; electrical stethoscopes and brainwave measurers which give such an accurate indication of the state of vitality of a patient deep under the influence of drugs that mental cases hitherto considered incurable can be safely treated ? hundreds of such examples can be brought forward  | to emphasize the great importance to mankind of close cooperation between the physician and the physicist . Medicine is growing in effectiveness as it progresses from the status of an art to that of a science . Progress in a science depends to a great degree on the tools which can be forged to aid it in uncovering truth . For many years the principal tools of the physician were his own five senses , but human eyes have bounded vision as human hands have limited strength . ' With eyes and ears that see and hear where before were only darkness and silence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his strength is as the strength of ten . These more-than-human eyes and ears , this beneficent sharpening of the senses , it is the province of physics and the purpose of physicists to continue to supply .  | GLASS SHARPENS VISION It adds a precious seeing to the eye . Love 's Labour 's Lost THOUGH glass has now been educated to be one of the most talented substances we know , its most valuable property still remains its transparency to visible light , and its most obvious use is to be looked through . For though the unaided human eye is a very sensitive device , by judiciously supplementing it with a few pieces of glass the penetration of its gaze and its range of vision can be increased several thousandfold ; and even the best pair of eyes needs glasses whenever its owner wants to see something very small or very far away . Whether these glasses are to be called spectacles , or telescopes , or microscopes , depends on what is to be seen , but each of these devices is made possible by the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through it . Light streams across empty space or through the air at a speed of about i 86,000 miles a second , but whenever a beam of light enters a slab of glass it is forced to slow its pace to a mere l zo , 000 miles a second , or even less . Why should this speed limitation make things easier to see ? Why should a near-sighted man , to whom everything more than three feet from his head is hopelessly blurred , suddenly be able to distinguish clearly objects a hundred miles away just because he looks through a curved slab of frozen syrup ? Why should  | putting a piece of glass in the way enable an astronomer to see fifty million stars where before were only five thousand , or a biologist to find wriggling animalcules in what before appeared to be a clear drop of water ? Because light is slowed down in passing through glass , its rays are bent whenever it passes at an angle from air into glass , and again when it re-emerges into the air . Usually the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two sides of the glass happen to be set at an angle , as in a prism or lens , the light ray travels off in a new direction . The eye suspects no such deviation from the straight path , and reports unfalteringly to its possessor that any object he may see is in the direction from which light rays from it appear to have come . A magnifying lens is thus a deceitful piece of transparent material whose surfaces have purposefully been curved in such manner that rays of light from distant objects are bent so as to appear to have come from closer and larger objects . So useful is this ability to mislead the eye that the world now uses lenses by the hundreds of millions , and the invention of a new shape of lens can revolutionize a whole industry . The ability to magnify objects is not the only useful function of a lens , nor indeed its most important function . The eye can utilize only that light which enters its pupil , a hole but a fraction of an inch in diameter ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gather in a great quantity of light , with which it can produce a bright image . A lens is thus a highly qualified light-funnel , able to keep the rays which traverse it from getting mixed . If a lens is of high quality the image it produces will be clear as well as bright , for the picture seen by the eye is formed by piling up a vast number of  | tiny light-waves , and the more waves in the pile , the more sharply defined will be the picture . If an ordinary lens be held in a darkened room and light from a bright distant landscape be sent through it , a tiny image of the landscape can be seen on a piece of white paper held at the proper distance behind the lens . The distance between paper and lens ? called the focal distance ? depends on how sharply curved are the sides of the lens , and on how markedly the passage of light is slowed by the glass of which it is made . To image objects near at hand the paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects are being imaged . If our eyes , which contain natural lenses , had instead been fitted by nature with lenses of glass , we would indeed need to be a popeyed race , for as we approached a friend to shake hands our eyes would perforce protrude ever further from our heads as we strove to keep him in focus . Fortunately the human eye contains a remarkable lens which is flexible so that its sides can be shaped to sharper or flatter curvature to alter its focal length . Unfortunately , many of us have eye lenses of faulty shape or adjustment . Surveys have shown that at the age of thirty the vision of more than one-third of all civilized people would be greatly improved by the use of spectacles . At age 41 half the population , at 52 three-quarters , and over sixty almost all people have eyes whose lenses need extra help . Many more people need glasses than wear them , and the gradual breaking down of prejudice against their use , particularly on the part of women , probably accounts for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the race . In cases where there is objection to the wearing of spectacles , lenses of glass or plastic which fit directly over the eye-  | ball and are so thin as to be unfelt and unseen can be used . These are even less liable to breakage than ordinary spectacle lenses , since they have the support of the eyeball , but they must be fitted and used very carefully . They cost much more than ordinary spectacles , but are coming into increased favor for athletic and cosmetic purposes . The lenses are kept clean and free from fog by the eyelid , and no disturbing reflections are sent back from their surfaces . They can not be worn for long periods without discomfort , however . Important as the contributions of science may have been in sharpening up the vision of many of us who would otherwise have a very hazy view of the world , an even more important use of the lens has been in making realms visible which no human eye , no matter how perfect , could hope to see unaided . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disks of glass which require special freight cars for their handling ? these are the eye-glasses that are opening new worlds to human view . ONLY A PIECE OF VERY PURE AND UNIFORM GLASS can be used to fashion a lens of high quality . Optical glass must be specially cast so as to be colorless and free from bubbles , streaks , and flaws . A minute quantity of iron or of almost any other metal can ruin an entire batch of such glass . One company made several expensive melts of lens glass which turned out valueless because they all showed the familiar green tint of the cheap glass used for bottles and windowpanes . A disgruntled workman had secretly dropped a small steel ball into each melt . Even the use of steel shovels to handle the sand which is to go into lens glass has been outlawed , for so many  | iron atoms were scraped from their surfaces that the resulting glass lost much of its transparency . After a chunk of clear uniform glass of approximately the proper size for a desired lens has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by rubbing them against curved metal plates sprinkled with wet carborundum powder or some other hard abrasive . No way of molding glass while hot into perfect lenses has yet been discovered , but if ever one is , lenses will become much cheaper . At present the glass surfaces are worn down slowly to the desired shape , and then gradually smoothed with smaller and ever smaller particles of grinding material . The last tiny scratches are worn away with fine particles of powder such as rouge , which , so it happens , in addition to being found useful by ladies to simulate hemoglobin , will give glass a high polish when imbedded in pitch and rubbed against it . In large optical factories hundreds of lenses are ground and polished at the same time . Several dozen lens blanks may be cemented with pitch to each of a dozen holders , and in a single machine long rows of these holders can be seen rocking back and forth together like dancers swaying to a tune , as the glass whirls under the polishing tools and its surfaces approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single piece of glass can not produce an image of desirable sharpness unless it be used with light of a single color , and in addition is so small that its focal length is much greater than its diameter . The ratio of focal length to lens diameter or aperture is called the aperture ratio , and numbers representing this ratio are usually found marked on the lenses of cameras , written as f/3.5 or f/i6 or some such symbol . In the first case the figures indicate that the lens is being used at a diameter which is 1/3.5 of its focal length ;  | in the second case at i/i6 of its focal length . A diaphragm covering the lens can usually be closed until the aperture is any desired fraction of the focal length . The larger the denominator in the aperture ratio , the more sharply can the lens focus light , usually , but the less light passes through it . Most commercial lenses have sides curved to fit portions of spheres , because this is the easiest curvature to give to a lens by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most desirable shape , however , and such lenses have faults called aberrations , which prevent them from producing sharply focused images unless used in a particular way . If a lens brings rays of light together improperly , points which should appear as shiny dots may be pulled out in the image into streaks like the tails of tiny comets , or into other equally undesirable forms . Or straight lines in the object may appear curved in the image , this effect giving rise to distorted pictures if the lens is used in a camera . Or the lens may form an image which would be sharp everywhere only if photographed on the surface of a sphere , so that a photograph album would of necessity look like a pile of trimmed derby hats . However , by putting together a number of individual lenses of different shapes and sizes , each a piece of a different variety of glass so curved that it will offset the limitations of the other pieces while providing some good qualities of its own , physicists have developed hundreds of varieties of multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in a particular way . Lenses which contain many pieces of glass are wasteful of light , for at each surface some light is lost from the beam by reflection , and this may be scattered or reflected to parts of the image which should be dark , thus giving less brilliant pictures if used in a camera . Far better than using many  | pieces of glass , when possible , is the use of new kinds of glass which give the desired result with fewer component lenses . As more varieties of glass become available to the lens designer , he finds ever simpler the invention of lenses of high quality for new uses . In the early days of glass-making , when the art was ruled chiefly by cookbook methods , England was the center of glass manufacture . During the middle of the last century , however , German manufacturers called on science to help them , and soon took the lead . The physicist Ernst Abbe showed , by theoretical calculations , that the microscope could not possibly be made to give sharper or larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses then available . He suggested that chemists be set to investigating the effect on its optical properties of adding other chemicals to glass ; perhaps a few borax or lead atoms , while not coloring the glass , would have beneficial effect on the amount by which it slowed the passage of light . So was laid the groundwork of the great Jena optical glass industry , which for years was preeminent in the world and only in the 1930 's began to be rivaled by similar American developments . Rule-of-thumb and secret cookbook recipes have had little chance of survival when placed in competition with scientific investigation . The science of lens design is still in its infancy , and great opportunities still are to be found in this field . When a new type of lens is needed the paths through it which will be taken by the rays of light must be laboriously computed ? a job which could be done much better by a machine , if someone could design the machine . Another machine badly needed is one which would turn out in quantity lenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the production of thin transparent films on glass which reduce the reflection of light , which is what ordinarily makes a clean glass surface visible . So-called invisible glass is produced by condensing on to the glass surface in vacuum a very thin layer of a suitable chemical salt , which " eases " the light wave into the glass surface so that less of it is reflected . This is of great importance in lenses which contain many components , and are likely to produce objectionable " flares " by reflecting light into parts of a scene where it does not belong . THE TELESCOPE OF THE ASTRONOMER , being designed primarily to gather light from stars and planets a great distance away , consists usually of a large lens whose function is to collect as much light as is needed to produce an image which is bright and sharp , and a set of smaller lenses with which this image can be magnified . The bigger the first lens the better the telescope , provided the shape of the lens be held within a millionth of an inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the image . Strangely enough , the bigger a telescope the smaller a star appears in it . This is because most stars are so far away that they would appear as mere points of light in a perfect telescope , and the larger the lens the more neatly can the light waves be piled together to form this tiny point of light . One of the largest lenses yet made is about 40 inches in diameter . With this lens , which is in a telescope at the Yerkes Observatory in Wisconsin , the moon when 200,000 miles away can be brought to within a hundred miles for seeing purposes . Many telescopes exist which are more powerful and hence  | can bring the moon even closer , but these use mirrors instead of lenses to gather the light waves and guide the rays . Clear glass , free from internal streaks and strains , is very difficult to produce in pieces as large as four feet across . Therefore the size of telescope lenses is severely limited , especially since two large pieces of different kinds of glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed together so that one improves the image formed by the other . Since each lens must be ground and polished separately , four glass surfaces must be shaped , each to within a millionth of an inch . Far simpler than to attempt construction of such large lenses is the use of a concave mirror to gather the light , for with this the rays can be thrown into an image merely by reflecting them in the proper directions , and no clear , transparent material is necessary . Glass still remains the most useful substance , but its purpose now is merely to furnish a hard inflexible support for the thin metallic coating which forms the mirror itself . Glass is used for telescope mirrors because it is hard and brittle and can be given a high polish after it is ground to the proper curvature , and because it expands less when heated than do metals or other materials . Greater and greater have become the diameters of the large telescope mirrors , through 40 inches , 6o , then the great achievement of the ioo-inch Mt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered by the Rockefeller Foundation and the California Institute of Technology for erection in Southern California . This great mirror gives mankind a i7-foot monocle with which to scan the depths of space . With it the light of a candle 40,000 miles away should be clearly visible ? how far a little candle throws its beams depends on how you look at it !  | The peak of achievement in glass manufacture which made this telescope possible came in 1934 , when as a result of careful planning the Corning Glass Works successfully cast a disk of glass more than two feet thick and seventeen feet in diameter . If the disk had been cast solid it would have weighed more than forty tons , but by designing a ribbed structure with a smooth upper surface , the weight was reduced to twenty tons and a thinner construction could be used . As it was , the disk was so large that it had to be sent across the continent by an indirect route to avoid tunnels and low-hanging bridges . It was stood up on edge in a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its lower edge and the railroad ties beneath . The same qualities in a special glass which made glass frying pans possible made this giant mirror practicable . Astronomers knew that if so large a mirror was to be usable it must be constructed of some flinty substance which would hold its shape to closer than a millionth of an inch under the temperature changes to which it would be subject . They knew that fused quartz would be ideal , but it had been tried and found too expensive for use in a big telescope . The glass manufacturers must try to work out a formula for a new glass which , if not quite so good as quartz for the purpose , would at least be good enough . They set to work , and before very long succeeded in developing a kind of super-Pyrex glass which when heated expanded even less than the old variety . This glass was used for the casting of the giant mirror . That the same material which is best for looking a trillion miles into space happens also to be best for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the telescope mirror nor the frying pan need be transparent , but they must share a disinclination to change size and shape suddenly when heated  | or cooled , the first because it would warp , the second because it would shatter . The astronomers got their mirror when the cooks got their frying pans . It seems inevitable that once the zoo-inch telescope has been in use for a few years astronomers will be wanting one still larger , but to increase the sizes of telescopes further will not be immediately practicable , for air waves in the atmosphere above the mirror cause the star images to dance about so that magnification of more than z000 diameters is useless . While it will probably never be possible to keep the stars from dancing as the atmosphere boils and shimmers , it may be possible to make them stand still long enough to have their pictures taken by making the telescope camera automatically jump around to follow the jumping of the star images . It has been suggested that a photo-electric cell could be used to anchor the camera to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image jumps slightly to one side the photo-cell will decide which way the photographic plate should be moved to keep up with it , as well as how far and how fast . All these things must be done within hundredths of a second , and the problem will be a difficult one to solve technically , but should be not at all impossible to men of imagination and resourcefulness. ' 4 THE TELESCOPE GIVES US A GREAT EYE for the distant , and the camera gives us an eye that remembers . Physics has given us a third eye , the microscope , for peering into the world of things minute . In 1870 there were only fifty microscopes in this country ; by 1948 there were more than fifty thousand .  | Better glass , cleverly formed into scientifically shaped pellets , helped make this growth in use possible . The real purpose of a microscope is to make us successfully short-sighted . To see tiny and yet tinier objects , we need lenses not larger , but more sharply curved so that they can be placed ever closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point where the lens is so small that greater magnification does no further good . The difficulty now lies in the light waves themselves , for too few of them are received into the lens to produce a sharp image . Enlargement by four thousand diameters is as much as is practicable with visible light , for greater magnification gives merely a larger blurred image , with the blurring magnified quite as much as the image . All science from medicine to metallurgy would be benefited greatly by new microscopes which would give clear enlargements of more than four thousand diameters ; ten thousand diameters would be very desirable , or , while we are wishing , scientists may as well ask for a hundred thousand . Provision of such microscopes , if we are ever to get them , must lie with fundamental physics , for the difficulty is not with the present-day instruments so much as with light waves themselves . A wave of yellow light , though only one fiftythousandth of an inch long , is yet too coarse to reveal much about a particle of matter smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too coarse to be used in lieu of a needle for playing a phonograph record . To feel the shape of an object satisfactorily with our eyes through the medium of light waves , these waves must be comparable in size with , or smaller than , the detail which is to be seen with their aid . A partial remedy is to sharpen up the seeing by using shorter light waves . These waves lie in the invisible ultra-  | violet region of the spectrum , to which ordinary glass is not transparent . So the call goes to the glass manufacturer to develop a glass which will be transparent to shorter waves . More mixing , melting , and testing go on , and a few months or years later the scientists emerge from their laboratory with a new glass which will transmit ultra-violet light . From this material new lenses can be constructed for microscopes of new form , and by such means the limiting magnification has already been almost doubled , and enlargements of eight thousand times are made entirely practicable . To make still greater magnification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be placed in a vacuum or in a container of hydrogen or helium , for air is opaque as the blackest ink to those ultra-violet rays which are less than about a hundred-thousandth of an inch in length . Nor can ordinary photographic plates be used to record the invisible images produced by such a microscope , for they are insensitive to these very short waves . Fortunately special plates which will serve have already been developed by spectroscopists . A new type of microscope has recently been developed by Edwin H. Land , whom we shall meet later as the discoverer of Polaroid . Land makes use of photography to take pictures with an ultra-violet microscope in three colors , which are then combined to make a color photograph . The colors are not actually those of the material being photographed , but rather are analogous to those ' they would have if our eyes could see ultra-violet light . In this way a wholly new type of observation is made available , which is especially valuable to the biologist . Often the abnormal tissues in which he is interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultra-violet colors which the new microscope transforms into visible colors.  | Other possibilities are opened if other kinds of waves than light are used for making observations . X-rays are sufficiently short to reveal the structures of the very atoms themselves , but they do this indirectly and show little about such relatively large creatures as bacteria and microbes . Electron waves can be used to produce greatly magnified images , and by using these in combination with light waves , images magnified thirty or forty thousandfold have been produced . Perhaps the biologist of the future will be feeding osmium or barium meals to his paramecia so that the internal arrangements of unicellular organisms can be made evident by dancing electron waves . Each increase in available magnification means much , and already a photograph of a clump of matter less than a dozen atoms across has become possible . The biologist realizes that the ultimate living creature must be cornered somewhere . It can not be smaller than a fairly complex molecule , which must in turn be made up of a number of atoms whose diameters we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beam of light through a lens , it matters little whether he considers the beam to consist of a train of waves or a stream of photons . But there are certain phenomena which , while not contradicting the idea of photons , absolutely require the conception of waves traveling through space for their understanding . Such phenomena are those involving polarized light . A beam of light emitted horizontally from a candle flame contains electro-magnetic waves which can be thought of as vibrating up and down , from left to right , and in every conceivable direction at right angles to the direction in which the beam is traveling . Such light is said to be unpolarized ; but if  | it be sent through a piece of transparent tourmaline crystal only part of the light will emerge , and this light is said to be polarized , for all its waves will be found to be vibrating in one plane . This can be demonstrated by sending the beam which has emerged from the crystal through a similar crystal . Only if the second crystal be turned so as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the light pass through ; if either crystal be rotated relative to the other the amount of light passing through will be decreased or increased , and when either is turned at right angles to the position of maximum transparency no light will pass . The polarization of the light is caused by rows of atoms in the first crystal suppressing all waves except those which vibrate in a preferred direction ; and how much of the light can get through the second crystal depends on how well the rows of atoms in the two crystals are lined up . Thus inventors are provided with a means of changing a pair of crystals from clear to opaque merely by rotating one of them . Polarized light has been a useful research tool for more than a century , but only recently has it found widespread application in industry . Strains in glass can be made clearly visible by sending polarized light through the glass . When a piece of glass is viewed in the strain-revealing apparatus , beautiful colored bands appear in it , green and pink and blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one side wherever the glass is compressed , and to the other side wherever it is expanded . By measuring the shift of the bands the exact number of pounds tension or compression in any part of the glass can be determined . Touch the side of a piece of glass with a hot iron while it is being viewed in such a strainanalyzer , and the expansion of the glass around the warmed spot can be seen clearly as the colored bands twist and writhe.  | Since the breaking strength of any kind of glass can be accurately measured , the shift of the bands tells at once how dangerously close the glass is to being shattered by internal strains . Cellulosic materials also produce colored bands when strained and viewed in polarized light . From such materials engineers can fashion celluloid models of axles or bridges or dirigible balloon frames , and by means of polarized light observe where the greatest strains are concentrated . Then they can devise improved models which distribute these strains more evenly , thus reducing possibility of failure under crucial conditions . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and the surgings of the forces in them can be watched and photographed . Typical strain bands are shown in the accompanying photographs , which , while less imposing than they would be in natural color , are revealing nevertheless . Light and sugar may not appear to have much in common , yet samples of every shipment of sugar that has passed through at least one Customs House have been tested for purity and concentration with polarized light . ' When sugar is dissolved in water the transparent syrup thus formed will progressively rotate the direction of vibration of any polarized light waves sent through it , and the more concentrated the syrup the greater is this rotation . The amount of rotation can thus be used to measure the concentration and constitution of the sugar . Some varieties of sugar give the light beam a right-handed twist , while others twist it oppositely ; strangely enough , though two samples of sugar may differ in this one respect only , certain bacteria can be found which will eat only the right-twisting sugar , and others only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name because it twists light in the right-handed direction . Perhaps the most striking effects which polarized light makes possible are those involving color . Mica , cellophane , and many other transparent substances separate light which is sent through them into two beams which are polarized at right angles to each other . When a sheet of such material is placed between two polarizing crystals and white light is sent through them , colors of great purity may be produced by the suppression of certain waves in the white light . ' Which particular hue will be seen in a given spot depends on the thickness of the material through which the light is made to pass , and on how the polarizing crystals are turned relative to one another . By rotating one or both crystals a beautiful pink can be changed to a deep azure , brilliant greens to vivid magentas , and dozens of varying hues made visible which resemble the iridescent colors of a butterfly 's wing rather than the pigments of a painter 's palette . Colored pictures in pure light can be produced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nitrate or acetate , illuminating with polarized light , and viewing or projecting the light through a polarizing crystal . The chief drawback to such experiments in the past has been that even small tourmaline crystals are expensive , and tourmaline is not particularly good for producing polarized light because it weakens and discolors the light which goes through it . A better method of polarizing a beam of light was devised by the physicist William Nicol in 1828 . He cut crystals of clear calcite at an oblique angle and cemented them together in such a way that the undesired portion of a beam of light was shot off to one side and absorbed in black paint , while the remaining light passed through , polarized and un-  | diminished . Until recently Nicol prisms have been the most satisfactory available means of obtaining polarized light , but they are heavy , fragile , and very expensive except in sizes under an inch in diameter , and are impossible to obtain in sizes as large as are needed . It has long been recognized that if some simpler method of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were available , use of polarized light would grow by leaps and bounds , and many pressing industrial problems could be solved . Such a method has now been perfected in the development of materials which can be produced in large sheets , and which polarize all light passing through them . The story of the development of these materials is an interesting example of how barriers set by nature can be cleverly sidestepped , with results of great advantage to science and industry . IN 1930 A TIMID HARVARD SOPHOMORE named Edwin H. Land discussed , before a group of physics students and teachers , the possibility of producing a polarizing material in sheets . He had an idea as to how the problem might be solved , and had succeeded in partially solving it , but was taking college training in physics so that he might determine how best to solve it completely . His idea was to polarize light , not with a single large crystal , but with myriads of tiny crystals piled side by side in sheets of transparent cellulosic material , with all their atoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same way . Today the material on which Land was working has been improved to the point where it can be manufactured commercially in large sheets , which are produced in vast quantities  | under the trade name " Polaroid . " What a wonder-working " celluloid " this is , with its light-polarizing properties ! Look at a light through two superposed sheets , and by turning one sheet the light can be made to change in intensity from maximum brightness to complete darkness . As long ago as 1852 Dr. William B. Herapath had found that small crystals of sulphate of iodo-quinine would polarize light like tourmaline crystals , but would even more strongly absorb half of an ordinary beam of light and transmit the remainder as polarized light . Herapath saw that this property should be valuable , but was successful in making only small crystals . Since his day large crystals have been grown successfully , but now Land 's method , and one or two others , have turned out to make them unnecessary , for thin polarizing screens are more convenient and effective . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crystals in cellulose acetate in such a way that their rows of atoms were all lined up so as to affect the light uniformly . Fortunately the crystals are shaped like long thin needles , and he could be sure that the atoms would be correctly aligned if the needles were all laid parallel . After trying various electrical and mechanical methods of turning the crystals all in the same direction , Land finally hit on a scheme whereby this could be carried out automatically in a machine , much as needles can be swung into line by throwing them on a piece of rubber and stretching it . Enough crystals are piled together in a viscous cellulose acetate matrix to ensure that no light can pass through without traversing a number of crystals ; when the matrix hardens the resulting sheet is found to polarize light almost completely . The crystals used in the polarizing screens are so tiny that each is thinner than the light waves are long , and more than 50,000 crystals would have to be piled together to give a  | thickness of one inch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1100 times without making individual crystals visible or showing unevenness in its polarizing properties . At present the principal use of polarizing screens is to eliminate glare , and this they accomplish excellently . The glossy paper of a book , the pavement of a concrete road in the hot sunshine , the top of a varnished desk or table , all act to some degree as mirrors , and light which is reflected from their surfaces produces glare . Light which is scattered irregularly from uneven surfaces is to a considerable degree unpolarized , even though it may have been polarized before reflection . Light , regularly reflected , as from a mirror , is strongly polarized by the mere act of being reflected , however . Just as a loose group of sticks oriented in all directions , if thrown against a smooth floor , will bounce with most of the sticks turned parallel to the floor , so a beam of light bounces with most of its waves turned to vibrate parallel to the mirror . A polarizing screen , with its power to stop or transmit polarized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off most of the regularly reflected light , which causes glare , but will affect only slightly the scattered diffuse light which is needed for vision . Desk lamps are now being made which are covered with polarizing screens , so oriented that only light waves are passed which are vibrating in such a direction that they will not bounce well from table tops ; and glare is greatly reduced by the use of such lamps . In up-to-date museums paintings are illuminated with polarized light to reduce glare from their varnished surfaces . When this glare is removed the effect is so marked that it must be seen to be appreciated . Sun-glasses can be fitted with double disks of polarizing material , with the inner disk arranged to be rotated . Twisting this inner disk will change from maximum brightness to almost total darkness the amount of light which gets through  | the two screens . If the wearer tires of gazing on the hot sands of the beach and wishes to converse with a friend , he need only rotate the rims of his glasses until increased transparency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material has been to eliminate headlight glare from automobile driving , but special problems of heating and of light efficiency have interfered . If all auto headlamps were covered with polarizing screens , and a small polarizing disk were affixed to the windshield in front of each driver at night , direct light from an approaching headlight could be almost eliminated , while light scattered from the side of the road , needed for seeing , would be reduced much less in intensity . To compensate for this loss in brightness , automobile headlamps must be stepped up in power , however , for even with perfect polarizing screens , much of the light emitted is thrown away in the act of polarization ; and then , after scattering from the roadside , much is again thrown away in observing . Headlights about three times as bright as those used at present would be required , and the needed power for operating headlight lamps would put a severe strain on the electrical system of any car . This , together with the fact that the screens absorb half the light in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become very hot , has thus far prevented this desirable application . Light is already one of the most powerful tools available to the scientist for investigating nature , yet many further uses of light await discovery . Vision is that one of the human senses which gives greatest penetration into the outer vastnesses of space and into the inner world of things minute . Scientists must learn still better how to bend , polarize , reflect , and otherwise coddle light rays into position , that they may be made even more revealing .  | EYES FOR THE MEMORY Oh call back yesterday , bid time return . King Richard II IN the Middle Ages there lived an imaginative inventor who , leaning over a quiet pool on a clear summer day , saw himself and the surrounding landscape mirrored in the water . " Ah , " thought he , " if I could only freeze this water solid , and thus by some magic hold this tranquil scene permanently recorded within it ! Then later , in busier hours , I might gaze into its frozen depths and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . " Freezing the glimpse of a moment in water will not , alas , make it permanent , but now we take for granted that a much less cumbersome process will do so ; we load a camera with film , point it at the desired scene , and trip a lever . So familiar is this procedure that we are likely to forget that it governs an extremely complex train of events which is successful only because it is held under rigid scientific control . Using a brush of light rays even more tenuous than the " comet 's hair " of Kipling 's poem , the camera lens paints its picture by informing each of a myriad of tiny crystals of silver salt in the film whether it is to deposit or to withhold the infinitesimal store of silver it contains . At least forty billion photographic exposures are made each year , yet photography is only now emerging from the status  | of a cookbook art and becoming a science . In fact , only recently have scientists discovered even approximately what occurs in a photographic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three principal fields of photography , which differ greatly in their needs and methods . The amateur photographer is usually interested in preserving glimpses of the past by means of photographic prints on white paper which he mounts in albums . To meet this demand , acres per day of the whitest paper obtainable are being coated with sensitive photographic emulsion and spread in half-mile lengths to dry in dark , dust-free , air-conditioned tunnels . Commercial photography concerns itself chiefly with the wide dissemination of the images of real or imaginary events of the present , and photographs made for this purpose are usually transferred to printing blocks by the half-tone or some other process , so that a hundred or a million copies can be printed on paper with ink , to illustrate books and magazines and fill the growing needs of advertising . The youngest and most robustious commercial field of photography is motion picture entertainment , primarily concerned with recording events which do not happen at all . So that many persons can observe these events simultaneously , the pictures are copied photographically on transparent film for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred million persons attend the " movies " each week , and to fill their demands for entertainment hundreds of feature pictures must be in constant production . Since a notion picture requires about a mile and a half of film , and from ioo to 500 copies of each picture are distributed , each uses an average of 50o miles of coated cellulose nitrate . In some motion picture plants a million feet of film is processed during every normal working day .  | Quite as important as these three great flourishing fields of photography is scientific photography ; scientists have eagerly made use of this eye which does not merely remember , but can endlessly multiply its own records , and with which the passage of time can be slowed down or speeded up . The physician and the biologist rely less and less on visual observation , and use cameras increasingly with their microscopes , their X-ray machines , and their spectroscopes . By expanding the scale of time with the low-speed motion picture camera they can watch the growth and division of cells in the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid lives , and thus make observations of a sort which give an insight into living matter impossible to obtain by any other means . Furthermore , the camera can see with light to which the human eye is insensitive , and many happenings otherwise invisible are caught by the ever-watchful lens . The hand is not quicker than the eye of the camera , for this can now catch and record events occurring in as little as a millionth of a second ; and " quicker than a wink " means little in scientific photography when five hundred separate photographs can easily be made in less time than a human eye can be closed and opened once . By fitting his giant telescope with a camera the astronomer can locate countless celestial objects which are invisible to the human eye , for the photographic plate is unhurried and can gather faint light for hours on end . By using the camera to speed up time , he can watch giant storms whirling across the face of the sun , raining down torrents of lead and iron and copper vapors from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in science , photography is found very useful . How many a tired surveyor , his wading boots cast aside , has pored gratefully over maps made by assembling  | photographs taken from the warm cabin of an airplane ! How much easier it is to lay a ruler between two mountain peaks on such a photograph , than to drag a heavy chain through the forests and across the swamps which may actually separate them ! The scientific and technical applications of photography , like its artistic applications , are indeed endless . ' Where no human eye can hope to go ? into the depths . of the ocean far below the plumbings of any bathysphere , down the gullet of a living patient , carried up into the super-stratosphere by giant bubbles of gas-filled cellophane or rubber , or in swishing rockets ? there the camera can go , recording what it sees for men later to read . WHAT A DIFFERENCE IN SPEED there is between the photography of a few decades ago and that of today ! Then , a person sitting for his portrait , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up a bit , was forced to hold one position for twenty minutes with his eyes closed . Now , a modern " candid camera " can catch the image of a swooping airplane in a thousandth of a second . Modern cameras are so much faster partly because they have lenses which gather in more light , but even more because modern photographic films are several thousand times more sensitive than old-fashioned plates . A picture which can now be snapped in one-fiftieth of a second would have required an exposure of ten minutes in 186o , while in 182o it could not have been taken in less than a day , using identical cameras in all three cases . The young lady who pastes a leaf on one bare shoulder and finds its form outlined in tan after a week at the beach is  | making use of an elementary type of photography . If she could sit still for days in a dark tent , with a lens mounted in the wall throwing a bright image of the beach on a patch of her skin , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright spots in the landscape would darken her skin wherever it struck . This darkening is caused by a photochemical or light-induced reaction , in which a dark pigment called melanin is produced by the action of the light . Hundreds of such photochemical reactions are known , in which light darkens ( or in some cases whitens ) a pigment to a degree which depends on the brightness of the light . Any such reaction can be used for photography , but films utilizing most of them would be so insensitive as to be useful only for making blue-prints or for similar purposes where plenty of illumination is available . Just a century ago , after more than twenty years of experimenting , Nicephore Niepce and Louis J. M. Daguerre discovered one of the processes which made modern photography possible , while at about the same time Fox Talbot discovered another . These discoveries involved methods of chemically amplifying a photographic image , and did for photography what the vacuum-tube amplifier did for the radio , telephone , and phonograph . No longer was each feeble ray of light required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the image by producing a dark deposit of silver where it struck the plate . Now the light need merely sketch out the desired image ; then this " latent image " could later be turned into a real image by chemical " development . " In this process chemical forces are used to perform the actual work of pulling and hauling electrons about and depositing silver atoms , which is necessary to produce a black and white image . Chemical amplification can be readily illustrated . Suppose  | that a lazy farmer has a field to plow . Since this farmer prefers shooting to plowing , he decides that he will sit in a chair and with his rifle shoot the field full of holes until its soil is sufficiently plowed up . This slow process is analogous to exposing an old-fashioned photographic plate of the type used before 1839 to the rain of photons in a beam of light . But now let the farmer become scientific ; let him bury small vials of nitroglycerin at three-foot intervals all over his unplowed field , and then sit in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a better marksman than farmer , each bullet will set off a small explosion which will loosen the soil in an area a thousand times greater than that plowed by the unaided bullet , and the surface of the field will be pulverized in short order . The farmer has used a process of chemical amplification ; his bullets controlled the plowing of the field , but the nitroglycerin furnished the energy which did most of the work . The analogy between plowing a field and exposing a photographic film would be better if the farmer could first shoot up his field , and then , by covering it with a sprinkling of nitroglycerin , produce an explosion wherever a bullet had struck ! Both examples illustrate chemical ' amplification , however . A modern photographic film consists of a strip of cellulose nitrate or acetate on which is coated a dried emulsion of silver salts in gelatin . This emulsion forms a horny layer containing myriads of tiny crystals , several billion in each square inch of film . These crystalline grains range in size from a few giants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tissue paper is thick , down to others too tiny to see with the most powerful microscope . In a darkened room the effect of light and development on these transparent grains can be watched through a micro-  | scope . Here and there tiny black specks can be seen appearing in the grains , and as development proceeds these grow larger and thicker . Each minute crystal in which a black speck appears ultimately changes completely into an opaque lump of silver , looking under the microscope like a miniature piece of coal . Silver , when spread in a smooth layer , is bright and shiny , but in a fine powder it is very black indeed . When seen under high magnification a photographic print appears like a vast snow-covered field on which designs have been marked with flattened piles of coal . The early developing processes did not give the entire story of increased sensitivity , however , for the sensitivity of a modern film depends markedly on how it is produced and on the kind of gelatin that is used in its preparation . Much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that used for coating films is of a special kind made from pieces of calfskin too small to be useful in the leather industry . For a long time the difference between gelatin which would confer marked sensitivity on an emulsion and that which would not remained obscure , but careful investigation traced the source of the " good " gelatin to calves whose mothers had grazed in fields where mustard grew . " If cows did not like mustard there would be no motion picture industry , " says Dr. C. E. K. Mees , director of the research laboratories of the Eastman Kodak Company . " Gelatin from rabbits is no good for photography , because rabbits do n't eat mustard ! " Now , however , science ( in the persons of Dr. S. E. Sheppard and his colleagues on the staff of the Eastman laboratories ) has solved the problem of producing faster emulsions , for these chemists have succeeded in dissolving from sensitive gelatin a material which makes even rabbit gelatin sensitive , and have also learned how this sensitizing material can  | be produced artificially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently the sulphur atoms which it contains are necessary to furnish a focal point for the beginning of development . Only a drop of this magic distillate is needed to increase a hundred-fold the sensitivity of a whole ton of emulsion ? enough to coat acres of film . Only recently has a clear idea been attained regarding what occurs when light strikes a photographic film and the film is developed . The role of the mustard oil , and in fact the entire photographic process , has finally been explained with the aid of the quantum theory of modern physics . In the original process of photography , each photon of light which struck a photographic plate could set free but one atom of black silver from the molecule of transparent silver salt in which it was imprisoned . In the modern process a few thousand photons , striking a crystal of the salt , affect it so that when placed in the developer every silver atom in it is set free , and the entire grain is changed from white to black by this freeing of billions of atoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emulsion , the more sensitive will it be , but if the grains are too large they may become visible when the picture is enlarged . Different manufacturers have evolved different ways of increasing film sensitivity without increasing grain size , most of which involve heating and chemical treatment of the emulsion . As the physics and chemistry of the photographic process become better understood , secrets of " cookery " are becoming less and less important .  | THE TINY VEST-POCKET CAMERAS OF TODAY , which weigh only a few ounces yet can take several dozen pictures on one loading , are far different from those of the period before 188o , when any photographer who wished to carry his camera with him had to transport an outfit weighing more than sixty pounds . And as cameras became lighter they became better and cheaper ; in 1915 the cost of an average camera was $35 , but by 1935 one could purchase a camera for $15 which could respond to dimmer light in shorter time . From the standpoint of simplicity the world 's first camera was better than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no focusing was needed . Light was allowed to enter a dark box through a tiny pinhole instead of through a lens , and a sharp image could be obtained on a film placed anywhere behind the pinhole ? the farther back , the larger the picture . Very little light comes in through such a pinhole , however , and to keep exposure times from being endless a lens is used to bring in more . Unfortunately , the larger the lens the more does it differentiate in focus between close objects and those far away . To take large pictures , lenses must be made as large as convenient , to collect as much light as possible ; but they are provided with iris diaphragms which can be " stopped down " to make the lens opening smaller when greater " depth of focus " is desired . A small lens of short focus has an important advantage over a large lens in that , besides being cheaper , it requires less adjustment of focus . The large lens must be moved farther from the film if objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to a very small lens the outside world is relatively farther away , and since every object more than three feet away appears to be a great distance off , it images all with uniform sharpness . A camera provided with a lens of less than half an inch focal length need never be focused after the first time , so its lens can be permanently adjusted at the factory . Small motion picture cameras have lenses of fixed focus , thus giving the operator one less adjustment to remember . A small lens can be made as fast-working as a large lens if its aperture ratio is the same , but the pictures it produces will be correspondingly smaller . However , a small negative can be enlarged to give a positive of the desired size , and modern cameras are usually arranged to take much smaller pictures than those of the past , the only limit being the size of the grains in the emulsion , which must be small enough so that they will not be visible in the enlargement . As research shows how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures will be obtainable on a given area of film , cameras will become still smaller and lighter , and cheaper lenses of smaller diameter and focal length will serve . The candid camera owes much of its popularity to its ability to take a large number of pictures on a film only an inch wide and three or four feet long . Future cameras may show this trend accentuated ; they may be built to contain several tiny rolls of film , any one of which can be selected at will , so that color film , extra-rapid film , or film for use by artificial illumination can be interchanged like the colored leads in some modern pencils . If the graininess of the emulsions can be made still finer without loss of sensitivity , a strip of film half an inch wide and a foot long may be used for a hundred or more snapshots . Not the least problem of taking photographs is to keep  | from under- or over-exposing the picture . Though our eyes report only a small difference in light intensity between a sunny day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times as much light may be available in the first case as in the second . The brightest highlights in any scene which is to be photographed are seldom more than fifty times as bright as the deepest shadows . Modern film is prepared to darken in proportion to the intensity of light falling on it over a range of about i000 to i , though this range varies with the brand of emulsion . Thus considerable latitude is left the photographer in deciding how much exposure to give in order to avoid making shadows too dark or highlights too light . Three adjustments are available to control the amount of light striking the film from any scene . These are the speed of the emulsion , the time of exposure , and the lens aperture . Film speeds vary over a range of 10,000 to i , though the films ordinarily sold to amateur photographers vary in speed over a range of only about 10 to 1 . The time of exposure can be adjusted , with a good camera , to any value between 1/ ' 000 of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographed can be kept at rest . A lens whose iris diaphragm is set at 0.9 gathers about ' zoo times as much light as one set at f/64 . These three methods together make available a range of about ten trillion to one in the amount of light striking the film . Yet photographers have little difficulty in adjusting exposures properly . A little bit of practice makes one surprisingly good at judging light intensities , but the surest way of getting correct exposures is to use an exposure meter , a photo-electric cell calibrated to measure the light available in terms of the needs of a particular type of film . Recently developed is a camera with an exposure meter built into it , so arranged that the iris  | diaphragm is automatically opened or closed by a photocell to adjust to the correct value the light falling on the film from any scene . Thus the camera approaches the simplicity of the human eye , with its pupil which in dull surroundings dilates until its area is approximately ten times as great as when looking at a bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1949 , makes possible the production of a completed photographic print within a minute or so after the picture is snapped , and requires no external processing of negative or positive . The emulsions are provided sandwiched together on white paper , and a capsule of chemically treated salve is provided inside the film pack for the automatic development and fixing of each photograph . The mere act of pulling the film from the camera causes it to be developed and printed by a dry process which is very rapid , and which provides a finished print within one minute . 4 4 ORDINARY PHOTOGRAPHIC FILM is decidedly color blind . Not only does it fail to reproduce color , but it ignores any light whose waves are longer than those in the blue part of the spectrum , and fails entirely to respond to green , yellow , and red light . Such film will , however , record light waves too short to be seen , and hence can be used to take pictures with invisible ultra-violet light . This possibility of taking pictures with short-wave light has made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a camera designed especially for ultra-violet photography , a whole new gamut of colors can be added to the ordi-  | nary spectrum . These colors are , of course , invisible , and the film records them all in terms of black and white , but by means of the spectrograph they can be separated and made to serve various purposes . Since these short waves can not penetrate glass , special lenses made of quartz , fluorite , or lithium fluoride must be used to focus them . Microscopes provided with such lenses , and using ultra-violet light , give the clearest pictures yet obtained of exceedingly small objects . Bacteria which are transparent to the eye must be stained to be seen properly in an ordinary microscope , but when ultraviolet light is used , the new invisible colors come into play , and the various parts of the creature stand out in vivid relief . Ultra-violet photography is now widely used for detecting alterations in bank checks , in wills , and in other forged documents . Forgers who believed , from the evidence of their eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing cleanly from a piece of paper on which was a signature which they desired to use , have received a shock when confronted with the evidence of the camera . In such a photograph the original writing can usually be seen shining through that which the forger has applied to the supposedly blank surface . Bank notes are sometimes marked with invisible ink for future identification ? ink which is invisible to human eyes , but which shines brightly when illuminated with ultra-violet light . Fingerprints which can not be made visible by ordinary methods can sometimes be detected by ultra-violet photography . To the eye a piece of paper may appear uniformly white , yet when a photograph is taken with short-wave light , smudges of various sorts appear . Perspiration , grease , white of egg , and many white powders are strongly colored in the ultra-  | violet part of the spectrum , and hence appear darker than the surrounding paper , or in some cases brighter . Other useful scientific tricks are possible when photog-figure raphy is carried out with infra-red rays , whose waves are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But to these waves , alas , ordinary film is blind ? or was , until researchers , working to eliminate the blindness of film to green , yellow , and red light , found it possible to make film sensitive to a whole new gamut of colors beyond the visible spectrum , and nearly equal in extent to this .  | Infra-red waves possess photons of relatively little energy and hence little ability to affect the photographic emulsion , but it was found that if a film was stained with any one of a number of dyes , the dye would absorb such light and use its energy to turn the emulsion black . The dye erythrosine sensitizes films to green and yellow light ; emulsions treated with it are called ortho-chromatic . A mixture of cyanine dyes , when applied to the emulsion , makes it sensitive to red light as well , and film so sensitized is called panchromatic , because it responds to all colors . Panchromatic film is coming into increased use for all photographic purposes , as its red sensitivity is of great advantage for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red , and it gives pictures which look more natural than does ordinary film . Step by step the discovery and synthesis of new dyes has proceeded in the research laboratories , until now dyes have been discovered which sensitize the film to waves as long as 12,000 Angstroms , twice as long as the shortest red waves . Even relatively cool objects emit these infra-red or radiant heat waves ; and by employing an ordinary camera loaded with specially sensitized film , pictures can even be taken in the dark , using a hot flatiron as a light source . Landscapes can be photographed in infra-red light with specially sensitized film , by using an ordinary camera fitted with a filter over its lens to remove all visible light . Shadows appear extremely black in infra-red photographs , as does the sky , while leaves , which reflect long waves well , are extremely white . If we could see infra-red light we would doubtless say that hills and meadows appear not green , but some new infrared color , for the greenness results merely from the fact that leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remainder of the visible spectrum .  | The most important use of infra-red photography is to penetrate haze . A beam of ordinary light can traverse haze only a short distance ; a beam of infra-red light can pierce the haze many times as far before the energies of its longer waves are dissipated . Obviously the way to see far on a hazy day is to use as long waves as possible , and infra-red photography makes possible the use of waves twice as long as those with which we see . From an airplane Major A. W. Stevens has taken many remarkable photographs of distant objects by using infra-red light ; in one , Mt . Shasta looms up over the horizon from a distance of 330 miles , though absolutely invisible to the eye through a blanket of haze . Another remarkable infra-red photograph taken by Stevens clearly shows the curvature of the horizon 320 miles away . Printing or writing on paper which has been charred in a fire so as to appear uniformly black all over is sometimes startlingly visible in photographs taken with infra-red light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and white , appear equally black in visible light , but in the new colors of the infra-red spectrum they appear different because they absorb infra-red light of various wavelengths differently . The penetrating infra-red rays will even go through certain kinds of black ink , and may show up underlying printing or writing that has been blotted out . Often old paintings can be judged best in terms of infra-red light , whose rays may penetrate surface layers of paint . A picture of a portion of the human body taken with infra-red light shows a complicated system of blood vessels and nerves lying under the relatively transparent skin . Since long waves are so useful , would not longer waves be found even more useful ? The answer is Yes , but certain natural limitations step in and prevent photography from being  | extended to waves of much greater length . Every particle of matter , even in a piece of paper or in the wall of a room , is giving out heat rays of wavelength only slightly greater than those now photographable . If films are made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be kept and used always in a refrigerated enclosure . Otherwise even the paper around them would spoil them , for it would give out rays which in the sensitive state of the films would fog them like ordinary films wrapped in a sheet of luminous paper . GEORGE EASTMAN BEGAN MAKING DRY PLATES in Rochester , New York , in 1880 . Somewhat later he realized the desirability of producing plates that could be rolled up to keep out light , thus making possible the loading of cameras in daylight ; and he first tried coating paper instead of glass with sensitive emulsion . The graininess of the paper made this un . satisfactory , so Eastman developed a " stripping film , " in which the emulsion could be hardened and peeled from the paper before a print was made from it . Later he substituted cellulose nitrate for the paper , and with this new film loaded in a " Kodak , " Eastman 's trade name for the simplified camera he developed , picture-taking became practicable for millions of enthusiastic amateur photographers . Motion pictures also were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts have credited the Rev. Hannibal Goodwin with first successfully using a flexible cellulose nitrate film , Eastman was certainly one of those to whom the idea occurred independently , and he it was who , with this and many other photographic inventions , gradually built up
