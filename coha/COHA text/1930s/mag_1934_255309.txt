RESURRECTION - William Gerhardi - Harcourt , Brace ( $2.50 ) . <P> Few authors deliberately pick a title some other man has already made famous ; but few have the effrontery of William Gerhardi . And Gerhardi 's effrontery does not stop at lifting Tolstoy 's title . <P> His first , best-known novel , Futility , was a take-off ( some phrased it : a comic appreciation ) of his idol , Anton Chekhov . Resurrection pays its suspiciously grave respects to another of his heroes , Marcel Proust . Unwary readers might well be taken in by Author Gerhardi 's occasionally indubitable solemnity , might almost believe that the psychic experience he writes of is meant to be taken at its face value . <P> Says he , in a prefatory note : " The experience of which Resurrection treats is , incredible as it may seem , a true experience . " Alert readers will note that Author Gerhardi does not specify what parts of his narrative are to be taken without salt , will realize that he is seldom averse to spoofing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference . Written in the undisguised first person ( though the other characters have pseudonyms ) , it tells how a brief experience of roaming in his astral body set him buttonholing his acquaintances at a London ball , telling them all about it . <P> While holding forth to one Bonzo , a critic , he had the happy idea for his book . " And I said to myself : If I were allowed to write one more novel only , what would I say , what would I put into it ? I would resurrect my life , make it live , before my existence comes to an end on this strange and wayward star , resurrect my life while I am dying . " Expanding on this theme as the ball proceeds around him , he relates to Bonzo what Resurrection is to be . <P> By the time dawn ends the ball , the book is practically finished : Gerhardi has resurrected his life , while London society , while the recollections of his travels , loves , adventures dance about him . Readers who find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to place him satisfactorily , will do well to take him as he comes , wrinkle no foreheads over the question of his " sincerity . " Though his unrelieved company in the guise of human soul may be at times a little wearing , as a wide-eyed observer his comments are never dull . Confessing his inability to make the most of sightseeing , apropos of a visit to India , he exclaims : " How did a closer acquaintance with elephants really profit me ? What did I get out of it ? Only that which I noted involuntarily : the elephants had a womanly walk which reminded me of Arnold Bennett . "
