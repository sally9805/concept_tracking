Up to snuff are Great Britain 's methods of putting her cause in its best light to the rest of the world . While the Germans stumble around with the horse- &-buggy; propaganda technique of simple name-calling ( Britain 's diplomacy is " perfidious " ; Churchill a " warmonger " ) , the British have developed a streamlined method which generally appears merely to put the clear eye of psychology on their foes . The British have so far branded Mr. Hitler nothing much worse than an interesting nut , the Germans as the victims of mass delusion . Last week the German and British methods met head on , to the former 's disadvantage . <P> According to a recent German official broadcast , " British atrocities " during the Boer War some 40 years ago included mixing powdered glass in the food of Boer children penned in British prison camps . Last week His Majesty 's Government cited " this shameless propaganda , which is wholly without foundation " as its reason for suddenly rebutting with much hotter and much fresher atrocity charges . Off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Concerning the Treatment of German Nationals in Germany , 1938-1939 . It was filled with details of torture and sadism in contemporary Nazi prison camps . <P> " The Papers " were mostly excerpts from pre-War II depositions made to British consuls in Munich , Frankfort , elsewhere in Germany , by both Aryans and Jews who had survived terms in Nazi camps , mostly famed Dachau near Munich and Buchenwald near Weimar . The White Paper quotes " Herr X , a well-to-do Jewish businessman , " released after six weeks in Buchenwald , as saying that " Jews were told that the Fhrer himself had given orders that Jews might receive up to sixty strokes " of the lash . <P> The usual punishment in Nazi prison camps , according to the White Paper , for even slight offenses , such as failure to salute promptly , is " twenty-five strokes on the seat , carried out by two guards standing at each side with riding whips . The prisoner is lashed to a board . If he cries out , the strokes are increased to thirty-five . Guards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as to bring down the arm with increased momentum . " <P> Another reported Buchenwald flogging system : " Fixed on the ground were two footplates to which a man 's feet were strapped . He was then bent over a pole and his head was secured between two horizontal bars . The men received up to fifty strokes . . . . Some went mad . They were then chained up and a sack was tied around their heads to stifle their shouts . " <P> " Merry-Go-Round . " The more inventive Nazi guards at Buchenwald , according to the White Paper , have a game they play with prisoners and trees : " If only a slight offense has been committed , the prisoners would be bound to a tree in such a way that they stood facing it and as if embracing it with their hands pinioned together . The straps that bound them would be pulled so tight that they could barely move . Guards would now ' play merry-go-round ' with them .
