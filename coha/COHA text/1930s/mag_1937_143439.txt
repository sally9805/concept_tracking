There were extraordinary doings on the third floor of Washington 's Willard Hotel one day last week . A score of photographers squatted in the corridor with lenses trained on the elevator . Newsreel men fidgeted with their cameras . Reporters milled around in the glare of light reflectors . Suddenly the door opened , an elevator boy gave them a prearranged nod , and President William Green of the American Federation of Labor stepped forth accompanied by George McGregor Harrison , head of A. F. of L. 's three-man committee currently trying to reunite the divided House of Labor . Waving his hands in inarticulate dismay , Mr. Green dashed for Suite No. 301-304 , followed by Mr. Harrison shouting : " No comment , no comment . " <P> Disgruntled by Mr. Green 's reluctance to pose for them , the photographers and cameramen settled down for another wait . Suddenly they spied Chairman John L. Lewis of the Committee for Industrial Organization striding , not from the elevator , but down the corridor , accompanied by Philip Murray , head of the C. I. O. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lewis &; Murray waited for the newsreel men to shift their light and focus , obligingly posed for a hundred stills . Then they , too , vanished into Suite No. 301-304 . <P> Arranged by astute Phil Murray when the formal peace negotiations had come to a standstill after six weeks of intermittent effort ( TIME , Nov. 8 ) , this was the first time Bill Green and John Lewis had met face to face since an unpublicized meeting in a Washington hotel seven months ago . They mumbled greetings to each other but did not shake hands . Later when a reporter asked Mr. Green if it had been " Bill " and " John " again , Mr. Green , whose manner with the Press is not one of his strong points , flushed , gulped and trailed off with a weak " Well . . . . " <P> The lion and the lamb of U. S. labor had hardly started to talk before they were interrupted by Tennessee 's Senator George Berry , whose unexpected arrival was apparently prompted in no small measure by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got no farther than the anteroom , however , for the facial reaction of the conferring labor-men was enough to convince their aides that the Senator , though still the head of the A. F. of L. 's pressmen 's union , was not welcome in the inner sanctum , and he was soon sent on his way . <P> With a marked lack of enthusiasm the crowd in the corridor took the Senator 's statement and picture , and then settled down to some fun with the Willard 's diminutive bellhop , Joe Johnson , posing him in innumerable belligerent attitudes defending the door against all comers . After exhausting the possibilities of Joe Johnson , who informed them that he had once been photographed perched on Primo Camera 's arm , the reporters and newsmen gleefully learned that the Willard was serving them free lunch and liquor . They ate in shifts , later took turns in a poker game , for any opening of the locked door might mean the biggest labor story since the strike in " Little Steel . " Some papers kept private lines open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running story on their wires .
