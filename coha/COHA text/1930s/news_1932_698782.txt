txt When a demure young divorcee on the witness stand confessed she had Paid $5,000 for the privilege of tossing bouquets at a middle aged married motorman because she was afraid of his wife , a jury in the Circuit court at Wheaton yesterday giggled more than a bit . The jurors also leaned across each other for surreptitious peeks at the apex of this triangle ? Albert Gregory , who sat cuddled against his spouse 's shoulder in the front row . The spectators snickered audibly . For even his best friend would not accuse Albert of rivaling Adonis . He boasts neither the Barrymore profile nor the Weissmuller physique . He is iron gray of hair and weatherbeaten of countenance , with a long nose and prominent brown eyes . Yet the slim blond in the trim black silk suit and vagabond black hat undeniably thought well of him when it all happened , six years ago . Sues to Recover Cash . Mrs. Jessie Erickson of Elmhurst , whose former husband tooted a French horn in the Chicago Symphony orchestra , brought the hitherto mysterious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grace , his wife . Mrs. Gregory was once a deputy sheriff in Wheaton , an ardent prohibition crusader and is said to be studying law at Northwestern university . Opening the suit before Judge Claude W. Shepherd , Attorney Glenn T. Johnson of Aurora for the plaintiff , told the jury that evidence would show that Mrs. Erickson and Gregory became acquainted in 1923 , when she was making weekly trips to Chicago on his Aurora and Elgin line run . Mrs. Erickson raised flowers , and Gregory was an ardent horticulturist . She tossed him a posey one morning . That started It . Their friendship flowered along botanical lines . They progressed from chatter of gardens to exchanges of lily buds and hyacinth bulbs , to slips of rose bushes and thence to slices of pie and slabs of cake , Gregory having by this time discovered Mrs. Erickson 's culinary skill . But the Dresden doll beauty who brought the suit denied indignantly that it had ever reached the point where she conferred a whole roast duck on him one Thanksgiving , as the defense contends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in April of 1926 , Attorney Johnson declared and Mrs. Erickson testified , the latter was roused at 6 o'clock by Mrs. Gregory storming her front door with accusations that her husband had spent the previous night there . Mrs. Gregory , Mrs. Erickson asserted on the stand , made a peremptory demand : " You 've got a $14,000 house here , " the witness quoted , " and I 'm asking You to get me $5,000 ? less than half of ft , right away . You 've wronged me and broken up my home , and You 've got to settle . " This scene was followed by many telephone calls and demands for the money , Mrs. Erickson informed the jury . Eventually , early in May , Mrs. Gregory phoned and ordered her to come to the Gregory home at w neaton at once to settle the matter . " Can Shoot Straight . " " She said , " stated the younger women , " ' I was n't born on a ranch in Canada for nothing , and I can shoot pretty straight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see why I should n't go , so I did . Albert met me at the door . She got down a lot of law books and read me the law , but I did n't know what it was all about . " Finally she shoved a promissory note across for $6,000. and I signed it . I did n't see what else I could do , because she said she 'd make me a lot of notoriety and a lawsuit if I did n't . Then she told me she 'd give me sixty days to pay . " l'ays Over the Money . Within the time limit the $5,000 was paid by check , Mrs. Erickson having mortgaged her home to raise the money . The Gregorys will probably take the stand today , ' Mrs. Gregory to assert that her rival paid the $5,000 for having alienated the affections of . Albert , and that the amount was justly due her , as a ' wronged wife . It is the contention of the defense , represented by Attorney Charles W. Hadley , that Mrs. Erickson frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woods and transgressed the conventions . This was denied yesterday from the stand by Mrs. Erickson . Asked what his testimony would be when called , Gregory grinned . " Wait and see , " he tossed back coquettishly.
