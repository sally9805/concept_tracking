 | MIDSUMMFR and high noon ! I stood by the parapet of a castle in Spain and looked out over a treeless red plain . Red , too , were the mountains back of the castle , their jagged peaks sharply outlined against a cloudless azure sky . They were the Sierra Guadarrama , which separate Old and New Castile . Beyond them to the north lay Segovia and other noble old Castilian cities famed in the history of Spain . On the sun-baked plain to the south stretched New Castile , with Madrid only an hour away by motor . Both Castiles lie on Spain 's central plateau . On the east , this plateau slips down to the coastal lands of the alluring Spanish Riviera bordering the Mediterranean Sea ; on the west , it merges with the highlands of Portugal . Madrid , on its wind-swept heights , is approximately in the geographical center of Spain . In the ruddy glow of plain and mountains I read Castilian history written in warrior blood . Madrid was not , as the guidebooks tell us , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plateau was wrested from the Moslem invader . The very castle by whose parapet I stood was once a stronghold on the frontier of Christendom . From out its great gate and over its wide moat rode armored knights pledged to battle to the death with a turbaned , white-robed host righting under the banner of Islam . Where Madrid now stands stood the Moslem fort ) ) f Majrit , built to defend the populous Islamic city now known as Toledo . If we dig deep beneath Spain 's splendid capital , we shall find it built on a rock as solid as the granite Guadarramas , the rock of Castilian strength and courage proved by those hardy Iberian crusaders nearly nine centuries ago . THE ROYAL PALACE OCCUPIES THE SITE OF MOSLEM FORT Traveling south from the Guadarramas , we reach the low-lying district beside the stony-bedded little Manzanares River and obtain an impressive view of Madrid 's western face . Beyond the narrow canalized stream , set high on a bluff , the Royal Palace towers white above green woods . Just here the Moslem fort once stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bluff lies the historic portion of the city ? the narrow streets , old-fashioned dwellings , and arcaded plazas left to remind us that this magnificent continental capital of tree-lined boulevards , palatial buildings , and widespread parks has evolved from a restricted , wall-girt Spanish town . The last of my many visits to Madrid was in summer , when the fashionables , like migrating birds , had flown north to the delightful Basque coast and the rugged mountains of Asturias ; northwest to green Galicia . The lure of French casinos , whose roulette wheels are not silenced as in Spain , had led many across the frontier . But the mass of the Madrilenos , and there are nearly a million of them , were at home , living , for 18 hours out of the 24 , happily , noisily , out-of-doors . In the leafy glory of parks and paseos , in sidewalk cafes , they lounged , chatted , ate , drank , and even slept . Those who still cling to the idea that Spain is a conservative land of barred windows and stony-hearted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragrant gardens of El Retiro , not a chaperon in sight ! MADRID 'S GREAT AVENUE ONE OF THE FINEST BOULEVARDS IN THE WORLD Madrid 's outstanding feature is the great avenue , Gran Avenida de la Libertad , one of the finest boulevards in all Europe , better known by its three divisions Paseo del Prado , Paseo de Recoletos , and Paseo de la Castellana ? separated only by plazas adorned with fountains and statues . The most imposing of the governmental palaces , museums , and hotels face this noble boulevard , which runs north to south along the eastern edge of the city . On its fringe lies an exclusive residential section and the large park known in the old days as Buen Retiro . Were the foreign visitor to linger in the capital no longer than 24 hours , he could still see much of its throbbing life on this one great avenue . The Avenida 's wide , tree-lined walks for pedestrians , lying between the inner automobile and carriage highway and the outer traffic roads , are vividly alive by day and literally thronged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on each side of the broad walks . Summer Madrid makes itself comfortable . All along the walks are refreshment booths . Beer is popular , but has not replaced the many typical soft drinks , in favor for centuries . As you sit sipping your cold , creamy , almond-flavored horchata , up comes the boy known as the barquillero . He carries a barrel-like metal receptacle containing the sweet , rolled wafers called barquillos . You hand out a coin , spin the wheel on top of the barrel , and watch for the figure which indicates the number of wafers you will win . No ban has yet been placed on this mild form of gambling . To attract the waiter 's attention , you follow the ancient Mediterranean fashion and clap your hands . With a glass of beer the mozo will bring you , as a side dish , a plate of potato chips , known as " English potatoes " ; or a plate of boiled shrimps , so popular , even on the hottest day , with Spaniards of inland towns . Army officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in midsummer , pretty , graceful , dark-haired women , sturdy , barelegged children ? these and countless other types pass . hottery sellers with strident voices , wizened peanut venders , coquettish flower sellers , cry their wares . " All the world , " as the Spaniards express it , is out-of-doors.  | The men are clean-shaven , for the most part , and smoke cigarettes . Cigars are only for the well-to-do and pipes are seldom seen . The women , as the census proves , outnumber the men . Even with fashionables away , the majority of those who crowd the promenades are modishly dressed . The young women have bobbed hair . " How , " I asked one of these slim , boyish-headed senoritas , " do you now manage the high comb and mantilla ? " She smiled and showed me . The short hair is wound into a little knot on top of the head , with a few added curls to make a firm foundation for the comb . But this , she explains , is only for special occasions , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For church she drapes a filmy black lace mantilla over her shorn locks . Upper- and middle-class women wear hats . The woman of the masses scorns a " bonnet , " yet her skin is free from freckles . COOL , MOUNTAIN WATER SPRAYS MADRID STREETS SEVERAL , TIMES A DAY Fans , not parasols , are the vogue . The paseos are all aflutter . It is to be regretted that continental and oriental decorations on fans are now the style , for there is nothing prettier than the old-fashioned Valencian fan decorated with typical Spanish scenes and figures . These fans can still be found , if you will search , along with painted tiles and china with Zuloaga designs from Segovia , decorated porcelain from the ancient factory at Talavera de la Reina , Damascene ware from Toledo , linen drawn-work from the Toledan village of Lagartera , and handmade lace from the south of Spain . The little dolls wearing regional peasant costumes are made in Madrid . The capital 's summer temperature is high , but it is a dry heat , not moist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner , to the shady side of the street , and there is a breath of cool air from the mountains . Madrid is elevated more than 2,000 feet above sea level . There is an abundant water supply front the Guadarramas , and in summer the streets are hosed thoroughly from four to six times a day . Systematic tree-planting and park development have made a refreshing city in the midst of a scorched  | plain , long ago stripped of its trees . The Castilian farmers of old believed the birds to be their mortal enemies and left no haven for the winged host . Shops close every afternoon from i or 2 o'clock until 4 or 5 . The dinner hour is late from our standpoint , from 8:3o-to 10:30 . Madrilenos know how to enjoy the magic hours of early evening . Open-air band concerts continue until 2 o'clock in the morning . If you stay up to put summer Madrid to bed , you will meet the huge , creaking , two-wheeled , hooded carts lumbering into town with country produce in round , straw-covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill of watermelons will soon be in evidence . Carts which come from beyond the mountains put up overnight in the old part of town , at inns for all the world like the fondouks of Morocco , save that jaded mules , drowsing in the courtyard , here take the place of camels . YOUNGEST YET MIGHTIEST OE IBERIAN CITIES On the surface , Madrid is modern , continental , as beautiful in spots as Paris ; but there are still odd , hidden corners delightfully medieval . In this lies the great city 's 232 THE NATIONAL , GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE  | charm . Youngest , yet mightiest , of Iberian cities , the Spanish capital reminds me more of Buenos Aires than of any of its Latin sisters . Like the far-southern metropolis , it is not congested and is surrounded by a practically treeless agricultural region . Facing Madrid 's Gran Avenida is the gigantic building known as the Palace of Communications ( referred to as " Our Lady of Letters " ) , which houses the postal and telegraph offices . This is one of the finest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the labeled locating maps on the outer wall just above the slots where you mail your letters . There are eight of these maps . showing different sections of Spain , with an additional letterbox labeled " Army in Africa . " Outside the main Post Office , stamps are on sale at tobacco shops in all parts of the city . In each of these shops is a letterbox . You can also mail your letter in a box on the red and yellow tram car , if you will run after it , and be assured of quick service to the main office . Near the Post Office are the National Library , the Archeological Museum , and the Museum of Modern Painting - all three of great interest to the student and art lover . Even more famous is the National Museum of Painting and Sculpture , better known as the Prado Museum , where are hung those glorious sixteenth , seventeenth , and eighteenth century masterpieces collected by the art-loving Spanish kings ( see page 239 ) . Here are the great mystic paintings of Domenico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " who came to live in Spain in the sixteenth century ; here the priceless canvases of Ribera , Zurbaran , Velazquez , Murillo , and Goya , foremost of the native painters who created for the glory of Spain ; and countless other treasures , the works of distinguished Spanish painters , and of Italian , Flemish , Dutch , German , and French masters whose names are known the world over . Rulers , nobles , and soldiers , who made history in the days when Spain led the  | world , look down on us from the Prado walls . In the opinion of many , this is the finest art gallery in existence . The Botanical Garden next door provides a breathing place for the poorer classes , a playground for those big-eyed , creamy-skinned children , whose beauty , vivacity , and good manners impress every traveler who visits Spain . Here even the poorest child is taught to practice the courtesies of life . THE SPANIARD INHERITS HIS LOVE Or NICKNAMES At the railroad station beyond the Botanical Garden the Gran Avenida ends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose popular name is " Mediodia . " " Perhaps we Spaniards inherit our love of nicknames from the Moors , " a clever Madrilei a once said to me . " Do you know what we call the station of that little railway down by the Manzanares River , the one that brings produce and a stray farmer or two into town ? It 's the Station of the Fleas ! " There are also railroad stations for northern Spain and France and for western Spain and Portugal , all lines converging on this geographical center like the spokes of a wheel . At present Spain 's longitudinal railway service is far better than that from east to west . In traveling from Vigo , on the Atlantic seaboard in the northwest , to Barcelona , on the Mediterranean in the northeast , I have found it more convenient to cover a greater mileage via Madrid rather than brave the poor west-to-east connections . Air lines are developing rapidly . An interesting short air trip can be made in a little more than three hours from the airdrome at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madrid , to a military station 12 miles from Lisbon . Madrid 's Eastern Park ( El Retiro ) has magnificent trees and lakes and the famous " Rosaleda , " or rose garden , with its three thousand and more varieties . If you keep on the driveways , you will meet . in the late afternoon , every manner of vehicle , from  | a smart limousine to a provincial muledrawn carriage ; but stray afoot on to the shady paths and you will find even more of interest . OPEN LIBRARY SHELVES IN PARKS HONOR AUTHORS The Spanish method of honoring dead writers and dramatists might well be emuulated the world over . Around the base of the lifelike statue of the man himself are grouped figures in marble of the men and women which his genius created . In an out-of-the-way shady nook you will find a tiled case , lined with books . sheltered above from sun and rain , but open and unguarded . It is the " Library of the Open Air , " open from 10 to 1 and 4:30 to 8 o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a neighboring bench ( see p. 249 ) " And are these books never stolen or mutilated ? " I asked a Spanish friend . He looked at me wonderingly , too polite to express himself candidly about any country where those who read do not revere and cherish books . He pointed to the inscription above the shelves : " These books are free to all and to the custody of all are confided . " Our Retiro mecca is the circle where stands the statue of a valiant old general . Here every afternoon in the year , at a certain hour , comes a scholarly , gray-haired man with the pointed beard typical of the " old intellectuals . " He is " the friend of the birds . " All about him , in a cloud . hover the wild ones of the woods , resting on his hat , his shoulders , even on his aquiline nose . No one crowds about to frighten them . Spain is , above all , a country where the wishes of others are respected , the land of personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foreigner it is a revelation to see a nobleman of Spain chatting amiably with his waiter or his coachman . Each class respects the other . A CALL OFD SOLICITUDE UPON A SICK ERIE NI ) One day I was walking with a Spanish acquaintance . She asked me to wait while she entered an apartment house to inquire about a sick friend . She came out so soon that I thought she had decided not to make the call . " I did n't go up to the apartment , " she said . " I just signed my name in the book kept by the doorman and received the latest  | word of the patient . In cases of grave illness we never telephone or call on the family . It is so much easier for those who watch and nurse if we simply inquire . The doorman is kept informed and the book registers our interest . " Along the walls bordering the Retiro Park is the long line of booths of secondhand booksellers , where many a treasure may be unearthed . From here it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets in the old part of town where you will find the alluring antique shops . Near the main entrance to the Park stands the monumental Alcala Gate . From its site , in the days of the old walled Madrid , a straight white highway led to the village of Alcala de Henares , where the immortal Cervantes was born . Madrid is closely associated with the life of Cervantes . In a village not far from here he was married ; here he wrote the last half of " Don Quixote , " and here , in 1616 , he died . The statues surmounting the magnificent Alcala Gate are less effective than those on some of the modern business buildings . It is the fashion to set imposing bronze groups on top of buildings . One group of golden horses so placed stands out among Madrid 's countless  | unique features and noble vistas , reminding us of the sculpture-crowned buildings of Rome in her glory . GRAN VIA CUT TI-TROUGH THOUSANDS OF BUILDINGS In the construction of the splendid Gran Via , with its big hotels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand dwellings , in a labyrinth of ancient streets in the heart of the city , were demolished . Above all other buildings in this new quarter towers the National Telephone Company 's steel skyscraper ( see illustration , page 248 ) . Moving pictures , screened in the open , attract crowds on summer nights , and by this method the telephone company is teaching the masses how to use the automatic telephone . And , speaking of the " movies , " Mary Pickford , Douglas Fairbanks , and Charlie Chaplin are Madrid favorites . I have forgotten what they call the lady , but Fairbanks is " Dooglaz " and Chaplin is " Carlito . " The Press Association 's thirteen-story building is another of Madrid 's structures which towers above the average four-stony buildings ( see page 231 ) . Following the main thoroughfare eat to west from the Alcala Gate , we cross the Gran Avenida , and continue along the wide , acacia-lined Calle de Alma to the Puerta del Sol ( Gate of the Sun ) , in the center of the city . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the one-time encircling town wall . Famous of old as a rendezvous , it is still the hub ? terminal station of many of the 50-odd municipal trolley lines . In the center of the Puerta del Sol is one of the stations of the underground railway , familiarly known as the " Metro . " By the surface entrance of each subway station hangs a map showing you where you are going or from where you came . Madrid 's subway carries passengers the length of the city , with shorter latitudinal lines . Riding north to Cuatro Camino ( Four Roads ) , at the end of the line , we  | find amazing building activity , big apartment houses springing up for the use of the growing middle class . TRAPPIC RULE CHANGED BY MAGIC OVERNIGHT As a means of communication between towns throughout Spain , the motor omnibus has taken the place of the old-time diligence . Such buses traverse the capital , connecting it not only with near-by villages , but with far-distant cities . In recent years there has been notable improvement in national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south . High-wheeled carts drawn by mules or by mules and horses harnessed tandem , donkey carts and pannier-laden donkeys , their heads decorated with red woolen tassels , add a picturesque touch to the streets . The cumbersome oxcart of Old Madrid has been banished . The turning of traffic from left to right was accomplished a few years ago by the late dictator , General Primo de Rivera , as by magic . Every driver of an automobile , motor truck , carriage , or cart , every owner of a string of mules or asses was given a sign which read : " Turn to the right . " When the clock struck 12 , that midnight hour in the month of May , this sign was hung on every vehicle and every beast . That was all there was to it . Madrid traffic now turns to the right . While the Puerta del Sol has lost its former prestige as the city 's chief lounging place , its shops and numerous cafes are still popular . " When the edict came that all our cafes must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those ancient restaurants facing the Puerta del Sol shook their heads at such newfangled notions , " a friend told me . " When the plaza clock connected with the Astronomical Observatory struck 2 , they all got up , carried their chairs and glasses of beer , or coffee and cognac , out onto the sidewalk , and sat there contentedly until dawn . "  | In Spain , 2 o'clock in the morning is what we supposed it to be , but 2 in the afternoon is 14 o'clock . We feel we are celebrating when we sit up until 23 o'clock , which is , after all , only ii . Children stay up late on summer nights . At midnight I have seen small boys playing " toros , " with horns tied to their heads and wooden blades for swords , and little girls rolling hoops and jumping rope . It was in the Puerta del Sol that I often met the seller of trained birds which fly here and there at bidding , and the seller of " singing " crickets , confined in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Leaving this animated plaza and continuing our way across the city , we follow the Calle Mayor to the Royal Palace , on the western bluff . But let us digress en route , turning off to the south . Here we shall find dark , narrow streets flanked by tenements and shops patronized by the poorer classes . It is not easy to locate a Madrid street , even though you may carry a map , as it is apt to have had its name changed . In a recently published street guide , I noted streets with new names , while four I hai previously known had disappeared altogether in the modernization of the city . WHERE BUL , L , PIGHTS , TOURNAMENTS , AND RACES WERE ONCE HELD Our detour leads us into the historic . arcaded Plaza Mayor ( called also Plaza de la Constitucion ) , surrounded by dignified five-story buildings through which arches have been cut to permit the passage of trolley cars . In this plaza , in olden days , tournament ; . bullfights , and horse-races were held . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philip III stark surrounded by flower beds in the center the square , autos-de- f e were once held . while royalty and nobility looked down from the windows of the surrounding buildings . As night falls , this is a romantic place . Let us eliminate the " unfashionables " sipping their mild aperitifs in the sidewalk i  | cafes and substitute for paved streets , tram lines , and electric lights cobblestones and oxcar , pine flares and tallow candles , and we have the city 's market place of centuries ago . We must restore to the men swirling capes and broad-brimmed hats ; to the women full skirts and mantillas which cover the face so completely that only one eve peeps out , as in Moroccan cities of to-day . In this old part of town is the central market , which sells to smaller markets . Country carts from all parts of Madrid Province are lined up in the square . " From where does your fruit come ? " I asked a ruddy-faced woman , with neatly dressed hair and the typical small Spanish feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bananas are from the Canary Islands and the green figs from Murcia . Those oranges are from Valencia , and so very sweet . The cherries come from Portugal . . . . Peaches ? I 'll ask Pedro . . . . He says they are Aragonese , and that the plums grow near Toledo . My brother Juanito brought the watermelons from our own village , not very far from here . " The woman 's name , I learned , was Chepita . She was very proud of a sleek black cat which perched on top of the watermelons . " The black ones bring good luck , Senora , as everyone knows . " At I : 30 in the afternoon ( 13 : 30 o'clock , Spanish style ) horses , mules , and asses , in the market square , have noses deep in feedbags , while their masters take a siesta , a necessity in a land where people stay up so late . Madrid grows yearly in industrial importance , abounding in factories of many sorts , whose employees are less contented than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uneducated class thrives away from the sun . In the southern part of the city stands the Toledo Gate , and from it a road leads out across a desolate land , where villages nestle at the foot of castle-crowned hills . 24G THE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE  | It is along this road , beyond the Toledo Bridge , which spans the Manzanares River ( see illustration , page 241 ) , that the gypsies , coming up from the south in the summer , camp . THE GYPSIES GIVE COLOR AND MUSIC To SPAIN It was in the fifteenth century that the gypsies first appeared in Spain , coming in at the northeast from France . To me , Spanish gitanos are much handsomer than their fellows of other lands , with their unique songs and dances much more alluring . That tall , clean-shaven , olive-skinned young man , with heavily lashed , cold gray eyes , is a gypsy horse-seller . They say he lames other people 's horses down in Andalusia in order to buy them " for a song , " cure them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the shears and clips fantastic patterns on the coats of mules . That young woman who followed us in the market , begging for centavos , the barefooted one in ragged , multicolored cottons , with a red carnation in her jet-black hair , is his woman . I know because I met them late one afternoon , when I persuaded my Castilian coachman , a trusted old friend . to drive me out the Toledo Gate and across the river to the wall by San Lorenzo Cemetery where the gypsies camp . Here we found the horse-seller sitting on the ground with his back to the wall , thrumming a guitar . Beside him sat the vivid , bold-eyed young woman , humming as she dexterously wove a willow basket . Two grimy youngsters played near by . We are told that the words " duty " and " possession " do not exist in the Romanv tongue , but joy of life was written on the faces of this gypsy crew . " Let us return to the city , Senora , " pleaded the old coachman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your purse and your watch . " The gypsies only stared at us coldly , but the old Castilian kept on grumbling , so I consented to return to town . As we recrossed the bridge over the river . I saw at some distance the new inatadcm ( slaughterhouse ) , of which Madrid is so proud , said to be the best-equipped in Europe . i  | Within the city , not far from the Toledo Gate , is the famous Rastro , the secondhand market , straggling down the hill and overflowing the sidewalks . Here we rub elbows with poverty . The Rastro is best visited in the morning , preferably on a Sunday . Everything imaginable is on sale , from a jew's-harp to a piano , from a chromo to an antique painting of real value . In the Rastro Square is a statue of a son of this quarter who volunteered in the war with Cuba , on a mission of certain death . He stands with a lighted torch in his hand . Back again on the Calle Mayor , we continue our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bluff . Here is Madrid 's largest and most imposing church , San Francisco el Grande , and , nearer the Royal Palace , the new Cathedral of Our Lady of the Almudena , in the course of construction . A MUSEUM Or THE FINEST ARMOR EVER WORN BY MAN The Royal Palace , filled with treasures of art , is a huge , granite-based structure , built in the form of a quadrangle inclosing a court , with open spaces on three sides . On the fourth , or cliff side , there is a sheer drop onto a park terracing down to the river . From the main building two wings extend southward , inclosing the Plaza de Armas , where , until a few months ago , tourists flocked at 11 in the morning to see the changing of the Palace guard . One of these southern wings houses the Royal Armory , which ranks with the Prado Gallery as Madrid 's foremost treasure . It is the finest collection of its kind . Here is the armor of Spain 's greatest rulers , the most superb ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many a historic battle field ( see page 229 ) . Navas de Tolosa , Lepanto , and St. Quentin live again . We see the jousting and battling armor of the great Charles V , including the very , suit of mail in which Titian painted him . The sword of Isabella of Castile is here and the blade of her foremost warrior , Gonzalo de Cordoba , whom the Spaniards call " el Gran Capitan . " Here is the Toledan blade of Hernan Cor-  | tes , with his helmet and shield ; the Valencian sword of Francisco Pizarro , and the arms of lesser conquistadores who , sailing under the banner of Castile , won a New World for Spain . To the north of the Palace is the large building containing the stables , coachhouse , and garage of deposed royalty . " Few horses left ; just a fleet of autos , " an American business man told me . But he was wrong . In the stables I saw carriage and saddle horses whose like I had never seen save on the stock farms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the coach-house a most interesting museum of old- time vehicles and harness . The view from the Palace heights is superb . Below l i e the two royal parks , connected by a b r i d g e which spans the Manzanares Rive r . Beyond a railroad station just downhill from the royal stables , w e can see the tree tops of the city 's great Western Park , proof that the Madrilenos are giving hack to this arid plain the trees which once they so ruthlessly felled . F a r beyonclk the green of the parks and the red and ocher of the plain tower the rugged peaks of the Guadarramas . Paralleling the Manzanares River , stretches the Paseo de la Florida , which continues a s a partially paved , tree - bordered highway to the north . They call it " the road to La Coruna , " but it leads , a 1 s o , to Santander , San Sebastian , and all those other attractive w a t e r i n g places along the verdant Biscayan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a speech delivered several years ago in London , " is girdled by charitable institutions . " It is indeed . One such institution on the Paseo de la Florida is an out-of-door school for the children of the working class . It sends motor buses for the youngsters at 8 o'clock in the morning , returning them to their homes at 8 in the evening . A man of wealth has recently provided a day nursery for washerwomen 's children . BOMBILLA , WHERE THE POOR MAKE MERRY Bordering this river road lies the district known locally as the " Bombilla , "  | where are situated those cafes and dance halls patronized by merrymakers of t h e poorer classes . Here the player piano is crowding out the good old hand organ , and the waltz and fox trot have taken the place of the merry seguidilla of La Mancha and the lively jota of Aragon ( see p. 254 ) . But you can still see the Spanish dances . Cross the river on a Sunday afternoon . Here men and women dance with joyous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the castanets , the " Oles ! " ( Bravos ! ) and those resounding slaps without which the true Spanish dance is incomplete . July and August are the seasons f o r the verbenas , or night fairs , in honor of patron saints , in full swing f r o in dusk to dawn , down by the Manzanares River , near the Western Park , and in those narrow streets in the heart of the Old City . The women of the masses get out their cherished tortoise-shell combs and embroidered shawls . Streamers of colored paper and garlands of paper flowers are festooned across the streets , and under these rainbow canopies are spread the long trestle tables on which are displayed for sale all manner of goods . These fairs carry us back beyond Roman rule , to the pagan feasts of the pleasureloving Greeks , early settlers on Spain 's sunny shores . Many who can not afford to summer at the seaside occupy villas in the foothills during the torrid months , commuting into town . The bracing air of the hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the nights in this clear , dry atmosphere are brilliantly starlit . The limited number of the fashionable set lingering in town find relaxation on summer nights in high-priced restaurants , where American jazz orchestras are the vogue . THE CAPITAL CITY 'S INTERESTING ENVIRONS Several places of interest lie within easy motoring distance of Madrid . Some eight  | miles from town is El Pardo , where Charles V had a hunting lodge . Nearer the Guadarramas is the renowned palace of San Lorenzo del Escorial ( see page 251 ) . This is a gigantic , melancholy mass of granite , whose priceless paintings and tapestries fail to warm our hearts after those dreary rooms where Philip II lived and died . It was this same dread Philip who built the mammoth monastery with its royal mausoleum for his mighty father , who was at the same time King Charles I of Spain and Roman Emperor Charles V. Here lie father and son , under whom Spain reached its zenith , and all the kings of Spain of the Hapsburg dynasty since their day , and all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a palace , pantheon , church , college , and library combined . The gorgeously decorated Palace of Aranjuez , with its woods and gardens , is some distance south , by the Tagus River . Here the beautiful tapestries which were justly the pride of the Crown of Spain were recently collected . All the above-named palaces are within Madrid Province , as is the old university town of Alcala de Henares ( see page 235 ) Three Castilian cities , among the most interesting in the Republic , each gloriously rich in history , can be glimpsed in a day 's journey from Madrid . Segovia , with its Roman aqueduct and its romantically situated Alcazar , from where auburn-haired , blue-eyed Isabella went forth to be crowned Queen of Castile , lies north of the Guadarramas , in Old Castile . The Royal Palace of San Ildefonso , or La Granja , famous for its fountains , is near Segovia . The road from the capital , through a splendid pine forest , passes the Alpine Club where the Madrilenos meet for winter sports . Avila , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles northwest of Madrid , while storied Toledo , high set on its hill above the Tagus , is a lesser distance to the south . I made an interesting motor trip within two hours of Madrid to the fields where black bulls for the bull ring are reared , and later to an inclosure where I saw the bulls lured into granite-walled corrals and forced into long , narrow boxes on wheels . Barred and bolted , the box containing the raging animal was ingloriously conveyed by four tame cows to the nearest railroad  | station . From here the infuriated bull was carried to the city of his doom ( see page 244 ) . ASSES ' , SHEEP 'S , AND GOATS ' MILK IN DEMAND One clay I drove through a hill village from which goats ' and sheep 's milk is shipped daily to the capital . The former is more plentiful than cows ' milk in the milk shops . Asses ' milk is also sold . At milking time , in the early morning , jennies are driven through the streets of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come the women with little tin cups to be filled with fresh milk for the babies . A never-to-be-forgotten ride was to those golden fields , quite near Madrid , one late afternoon , when the sun , like a great red lantern , hung low in the western sky . On the highway stood more than a dozen oxcarts , which had brought the sheaves of the reapers to the threshing-floor . Such a floor is called era , from the Latin area , and the method of threshing has changed very little in two thousand years . There were several of these hard earth , OGRAPHIC MAGAZINE VOL . LX , N floors in the field . On each of these a mule or an ass or a pair of oxen walked round and round , dragging a sort of sled armed beneath with flints . Atop each sled stood a boy or girl shouting and brandishing a whip ( see lower illustration , page 242 ) . The sun sent luminous rays through the golden haze of flying chaff , and along these brilliant aerial avenues flitted hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxcarts , where I could see , in the distance , the outskirts of Madrid . It will not be many years before that great city will spread for miles over the plain , becoming less Spanish , more continental , in its growth . But these country people , who toil in the fields so near the capital , will be slow to change . Generation on generation they have clung to old customs ; have retained a certain rugged outline of feature , a certain untamed pride . Zuloaga has painted them , the hard , clear-cut profile , the noble bearing , against an austere background of denuded hills . Like the granite of the Guadarramas , this virile Castilian type will endure .
