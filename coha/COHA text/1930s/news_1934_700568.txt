txt Controlled inflation through the remonetization of silver is proposed in a bill unanimously reported to the Senate today by the Agriculture Committee . The measure combines essentials of the Dies bill , passed by the House to encourage the sale of farm products through a 25 per cent discount on silver and the amendment for nationalization of silver sponsored by Senator Thomas of Oklahoma . Senator , Republican leader , joined with other committee members in making the report unanimous . Senator Pittman , who was chairman of the monetary committee at the London Economic Conference and helped frame the silver amendment , said that it " provides for controlled inflation based on intrinsic metal value . " The measure itself declares that a broader base is necessary for the monetary system . Appealing as it does not only to those who favor inflation but to the so-called free-silver advocates and the farm States , the proposal commands , its advocates say , ' enough votes to force it through Congress . Treasury officials are reported against it and that fact is accepted to mean that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver amendment contemplates nationalization of silver and has as its objective the restoration of 1926 price levels favored by the President as the goal of his program . 50,000,000 Ounces a Month . Its essential features provide : 1 . For nationalization of all domestic silver at a price to be fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury on the day preceding the issue of a proclamation that the law is in effect . 2 . Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to enter the world market after Jan. 1 , 1935 , and begin the purchase of bullion with silver certificates . His purchases are limited to not less than 50 , - 000,000 ounces per month . 3 . The domestic silver purchased shall be made the basis of silver certificates . The purchase of silver Is to cease : 1 . When commodity prices reach the 1926 price levels , or 2 . When silver has reached $1.29 an ounce , placing it on a parity with gold . Purchase would be resumed if the general price falls later to 97 per cent of the 1926 level or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measured in gold . In his report to the .5. enate for the committee , Senator Thomas , explaining some features of the proposed legislation , said : " This bill designates and authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury and the Export-Import Bank of Washington to proceed directly and through market agencies and such other agencies as may be provided to seek a foreign market for the surplus agricultural products of the United States and her possessions , and to accept in payment for such surplus agricultural products either bullion silver or silver coin at such value per ounce as may be agreed upon , and at a premium of not less than 10 per centum nor more than 25 per centum above the world market price of silver at the time of the consummation of such sale . Certificate Issue Provided . " The bank is directed to deposit the silver bullion or coin received in exchange for said products with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary shall immediately cause to be issued against such silver ' bullion or coin silver certificates based upon a value of $1.29 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver at such rate of $1.29 per fine ounce . " It is also provided that out of the certificates issued at the rate of $1.29 per fine ounce , the bank shall pay for such silver received at the price for which it was accepted plus the premium as may be fixed from time to time by the bank , but that the value as fixed and the premium together shall not at any time exceed the sum of $1.29 per fine ounce of silver . " Under the provisions of the bill , until the world price of silver reaches approximately $1 per ounce , there will be a profit as seigniorage to the Treasury of a sum representing the amount of the difference between the world price of silver plus the premium fixed and the sum of $1.29 per ounce . " Under the provisions of the bill , all purchases are to be made and paid for with silver certificates issued against the silver bullion or coins received at the rate of $1.29 per fine ounce ; hence , it is impossible for the Treasury to lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sale of American agricultural surpluses abroad . " For Supply of " New Money . " Senator Thomas emphasized that the bill is designed to accomplish the following purposes : " 1 . Enable the United States to dispose of all agricultural surpluses and to encourage farm prices and prices generally . " 2 . Increase the price of silver and thereby open up the markets of silver-using countries to American exportable products and goods . " 3 . Put into the hands of the producers an adequate quantity of new money which can not be withdrawn from circulation by arbitrary action of some board or bank . " 1 . Retain the markets of the world for American agricultural surplus products and increase employment by making profitable the production of exportable crops in the United States and possessions . " It is impossible to forecast the amount of silver that may be received in exchange for such agricultural surpluses , Senator Thomas said , and also it is impossible to estimate the amount of silver which may be secured under the nationalization provisions of the act . " Likewise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forecast the amount of silver which it may be found necessary to purchase in order to reinstate  --  either the 1926 price level or the parity value of silver of $1.29 per fine ounce . " But whatever silver is received through either or all of the provisions of the bill , there will be a profit accruing to the Treasury of the United States . " For illustration : If the United States should receive 1,000,000,000 ounces of fine silver at an average price or total cost of 644 , cents per fine ounce , payable in silver certificates , then there would accrue to the Treasury as profit , or seigniorage , an additional 64eh ' cents per fine ounce , or " a total profit in silver certificates in the sum of $645 , - 000,000.
