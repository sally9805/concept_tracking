Waving banners inscribed DEATH TO THE MURDERERS , a mob of more than 1,000 Armenians surged and shouted in front of Manhattan 's Homicide Court one day last week . To be arraigned were seven men accused of stabbing to death huge Archbishop Leon Tourian , primate of 130,000 souls in the Armenian Apostolic Church in America , before the altar of Holy Cross Armenian Church on Christmas Eve ( TIME , Jan. 1 ) . The mob lusted to get their vengeful hands upon the seven , but 75 mounted police charged into the street , drove them back . From nowhere , a patrol wagon whizzed up , out of which seven trembling Armenians were hustled into court . Promptly their case was adjourned . <P> Meanwhile the murder of Archbishop Tourian continued to cause violent repercussions wherever there were Armenians to line up for or against the Tashnag , Armenian ultra-nationalist party . Tashnag members were supposed to have drawn lots to pick the Archbishop 's killers . In Boston a noisy anti-Tashnag mass meeting was held . In Philadelphia , 500 members of St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , guarded it in relays night &; day , ousted their hot-eyed pastor , Rev. Bassig Sarkisian . They charged that in defiance of the orders of the Catholicos , supreme head of the Armenian Church , he had refused to hold 40 days of mourning for the Archbishop .
