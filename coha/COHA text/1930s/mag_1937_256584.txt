Those Philharmonic subscribers who considered Guest Conductor Igor Stravinsky too bloodless and ascetic ( TIME , Jan. 25 ) last week found his successor , Georges Enesco , more to their taste . They clapped warmly when the burly , bigheaded Rumanian walked awkwardly onto the stage of Carnegie Hall to lead the Philharmonic for the first time in his life . Stoop-shouldered and serious , Georges Enesco showed in his conducting neither the agility of Barbirolli nor the machine regularity of Stravinsky . But nobody could doubt Enesco 's knowledge of the orchestra , his anxious and humble devotion to the scores . <P> Except for the Gluck overture with which he began , Enesco played music that Manhattan seldom hears . Throughout he had plenty of opportunity to indulge his fondness for big climaxes and shattering brasses . But even these could not keep people from realizing that the Dukas Symphony in C Major was hackneyed and too long . Rumanian Mihail Jora 's Marche Juive , played for the first time in the U. S. , sounded trifling . <P> Like Stravinsky , Georges Enesco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience was warmest in praise of his Symphony in E Flat Major , found it packed with ' thematic material , glowing with unfamiliar melodies . For those who knew about Enesco 's boyhood in the Rumanian countryside , this was not surprising . <P> Georges Enesco 's people were farmers . <P> He was born in the Moldavian Hills in 1881 . He used to listen to the songs of gypsies and repeat them on a crude , three-stringed fiddle . At 7 , his father tried to enter him in Vienna Conservatory . Master Hellmesberger squinted over his spectacles , growled that the Conservatory was " not a cradle , " took the boy in grudgingly . Four years later young Georges won first prizes in violin and harmony . <P> Enesco was 12 when he continued his studies in composition and harmony at the Paris Conservatory . He had teachers like Massenet and Faure . At 17 he took a brilliant first prize in violin and began to tour . <P> Today , Georges Enesco remains a great violinist and a gifted composer . Rumanians consider him their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginnings of a true Rumanian school in music . For eleven years Enesco was Yehudi Menuhin 's violin teacher , and the two broadcast a violin duet together last fortnight in Manhattan . Prodigy Menuhin , now 20 , says : " In Enesco I have discovered what I have been searching for all my lifetime . "
