txt The outlook for the motor industry over the next few months shows little prospect of material improvement in production and sales . This condition is partly due to seasonal considerations , partly to the business depression and partly to the desire of leading companies to continue establishing the motor situation on the soundest fundamental basis possible , particularly so far as the dealer is concerned . With the readjustment well under way and in many directions accomplishing results , which , while painful to the income account , are considered desirable , the industry is resigned to wait a few months longer before taking an entirely new start on its next era of prosperity . Earnings of leading motor companies , particularly those for the third quarter of the year . which ends this month and which includes the July shut-down period . undoubtedly will reflect the low rate of factory production with rather disappointing results . Model changes and the usual year-end drop in activity will react against fourth quarter results . However , the industry , which has been running at a low rate during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to devote its chief efforts for the balance of the year to a further general clearing up of unsold new and used car stocks in the hands of dealers . Such stocks have already reached unusually small proportions . With public demand for cars at a low level , manufacturers are not adverse to holding down their output and permitting further thorough liquidation . With all surplus having been thoroughly liquidated before the end of the spring season , a further reduction in unsold stocks in the territory at this time . when buying interest is apathetic , will be reflected beneficially on conditions when such interest again returns to normal While dealers are reducing stocks . the factories will be preparing for improved business expected in 1931 as the result of this year 's subnormal sales . Loss Point Touched In August August automobile production in " United States and Canada totaled 240.100 cars and trucks , compared with 272,551 in July and 512.80. in August . 192P. according to estimate by National AutdrnObile Chamber of Commerce . Including estimate for August , production during first eight months of 1930 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period Of 1929 . Eight months ' output of current year was 35 ' , below the ** average for similar periods . Last month 's output was the lowest so far this year . The previous low point was in July . with production of 272.531 units . The high rate of production in July and August a year ago , when Ford operations were in full swing , accentuated this year 's decline . July , 1929. output was 518,301 units and August was 512.842 units The falling off this year as compared with that of July . 1929 , figure was ** August showed a 53.1% decline , the largest so far this year Ford production which has held up remarkabl. ? this year is currently well below last year 's record . The poor showings in July and August this year were due to the vacation shutdowns by a number of leading manufacturers , including Ford , which carried over from July to August . The unit figures of output in July did not adequately reflect the extent of the shutdown . since in some instances assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other departments were closed . For instance Ford was inactive fair two weeks in July , yet that company 's output apparently was in excess Of 133.000 units , a decline of only 41,500 units from the June total of 174,528. and comparing with the April record of 206,340 when operations were at the peak . Ford 's Average 10.7% ' Linder Last Tear Like the rest of the industry , however . Ford shoWed the largest decline in relation to the corresponding period of 1029 when a total of 196,505 units were produced in July . This year 's output was 32.3% below that figure . In January , Ford 's output was 26.5%. compared with the same month in 1929 . With these exceptions ( January and July ) , all other months this year prior to July have shown Ford varying less than 10% from the 1929 records . His average for the first seven months of 1930 was 10.7% lower with an output this year of 1,129,388 units against 1,264,701 in the same period of 1929 . August totals are not yet available . Ford output in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 37.9% in 1929 . Although Chevrolet plants did not suspend operations during July , output for the month showed a further decline . A total of 56,695 units were turned out , compared with 80,215 in June . For the first seven months this year . Chevrolet output was 637,617 Units or 24.5% of the industry 's total , compared with 964,352 or 24.5% of the total for the first seven months of 1929 . In other words , whereas Chevrolet has been successful in maintaining its proportionate share of the industry 's total business , its volume has declined 33.8% , during the seven months this year as compared with 1929 . The whole industry , including both Chevrolet and Ford , has been operating on the average so far this year at about 66% of last year 's record levels and at about 95% of 1928 levels . It has been a feature of the trade recently , however , that output has been dropping not only further behind 1929 records , but also below 1928. which has been recognized as a more normal year . Consequently shrewd observers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of having returned to normal levels following the boom of 1929. the pendulum has been swinging below normal . Delay in Buying Seen This , condition is creating delayed buying Which should come back into the market at some later time . The market has become sufficiently stabilized over a period of years to indicate a normal demand for upwards of 4,600.000 vehicles annually . If . as now seems likely , the output this year goes to a total of only 4,000,000 or less , It is evident that the normal requirements of the market have not been taken care of , and are setting Up a backlog which should make its appearance with better conditions in 1931 . It is on this basis that leading manufacturers are already beginning to lay plans for a better than average market in 1931 . Instead of pushing production aggressively at this time , the slate is being thoroughly cleaned and preparations are under way in several quarters to introduce striking offerings to the returning automobile buyer next season . A number of these new offerings are scheduled for appearance early in November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models at the end of the year , have been in the habit of bringing them out . Low stocks of cars in dealers ' hands have made it possible to introduce new lines well in advance of the dates set for the automobile show early in January which heretofore has marked an important model changing period for the industry .
