MAGNUS MERRIMAN-Eric Linklater-Farrar &; Rinehart ( $2.50 ) . <P> For seven months Farrar &; Rinehart 's Vice President John Chipman Farrar has worn a broad grin . For all that time Hervey Allen 's Anthony Adverse , Farrar-published , led U. S. fiction best-seller lists . Three weeks ago it dropped to second place , nosed out by Sinclair Lewis 's much-boosted Work of Art . But Publisher Farrar 's grin did not perceptibly lessen . In England , too , Anthony Adverse was running second , topped only by another alliterative title , Magnus Merriman . This week , by bringing out Magnus Merriman 's U. S. edition , Publisher Farrar very nearly cornered the international best-seller market . <P> Author Linklater , already known in the U. S. by a satirical and a prehistoric novel ( Juan in America , The Men of Ness ; TIME , Mar. 4 , 1931 ; Mar. 27 ) has written by far his best book in Magnus Merriman . A picaresque satire , it has little malice , much humor . Though it strikes many a shrewdly glancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is definitely on the side of the conservative angels . Though its story wanders like its hero 's volatile mind , it is well told , thickly peopled with engagingly human characters . <P> Magnus Merriman , son of a country schoolmaster in Orkney , got a taste for seeing the world during the War . He lost his job as teacher in a Bombay missionary college by writing scurrilous verses , but on his roundabout way back to England he got the material for a best-selling novel . In London he enjoyed himself for a while , but when an old friend urged him to come to Edinburgh and join the Scottish Nationalist movement he thought he might as well . Easily led astray by new enthusiasms , Magnus acquired in Edinburgh a passionate political creed , a new mistress , several severe hangovers . Persuaded to stand for Parliament , he campaigned fiercely , was ignominiously defeated , fleeced by his manager . Disgusted with politics and his mistress , who was becoming possessive , Magnus took refuge in Orkney , relapsed delightedly into the life of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in trouble again , and he went back to London , tried his hand at journalism . When a letter from the pretty Orkney lass informed him that she was going to have a baby , Magnus quixotically rushed back to marry her . She turned out to be a handsome termagant , but this time Magnus was caught . He settled down to be a literary farmer , a henpecked but occasionally drunken husband . His tireless hopes he transferred to his infant son . <P> Written with polysyllabic polish , Magnus Merriman occasionally threatens to become stylistically top-heavy , but usually Author Linklater 's sly gusto keeps it right-side-up . He likes a neat phrase ( " politics , that alluring perversion of patriotism " ) but usually makes glitter subservient to sense . His humor raises no sniggers but hearty snorts . When Magnus and his bride , having been up all night with the reveling wedding guests , set off in a car for their honeymoon , they passed one of the guests crawling on hands and knees along the road . Magnus stopped the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ts this the road to Birsay ? ' asked the crawler . ' Yes ' said Magnus . ' But you 've six miles to go . ' ' It 's early yet , ' said the crawler , and plodded on . "
