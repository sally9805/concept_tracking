txt The nation 's railroads. sponsoring changes in the present rate-making procedure . won an important concession from shippers and other interests yesterday in a resolution adopted by the National Transportation Conference . The resolution , recognizing the carriers ' right to sufficient revenues to provide and maintain an adequate credit position , was passed when the conference reconsidered its action of Monday when it threw out of its agenda all suggestions for changing rate making procedure . Railroad interests here were highly pleased with the action taken by the Transportation Conference , as it represented the first public recognition by shipping interests of the need for changes in the rate-making section . Vt'ording of Resoluthin The resolution stated : " It is the sense of the conference that the present provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act should be supplanted to include language which would make it the duty of the Interstate Commerce Commission . in passing upon appropriate questions , to give consideration to the need of the carriers for revenues sufficient to assure that their credit position will be strengthened to a point where the return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrier systems of the country will be sufficient to attract the private canital needed for the maintenance and development of such systems so ) as to be available at all times to serve the public needs properly . " The railroads have sponsored proposed changes in the law which would remove the present requirement that the ICC , in fixing rates , shall give consideration , among other factors . to the effect on the movement of traffic of rate changes- While the resolution passed by the conference is couched in broad general terms , it is felt in railroad quarters that legislation giving effect to the sense of the resolution will suffice largely to meet their criticism of the present section . Action on proposals for the creation of a transportation authority , or administrator , to plan and promote railroad economies , was deferred until a later meeting of the group . Public Hearings on Lea Bill Meanwhile , railroad legislative proposals were started on their way through Congress when the House interstate and foreign commerce committee opened public hearings on the Lea omnibus railroad bilL Yesterday 's sole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Splawn who told the group that there was a pressing need for legislation to coordinate and correlate the various agencies of transportation to prevent destruction or permanent impairment of investment in carrier facilities . Commissioner Splawn , who did not reach the point of specific proposals , devoted his testimony principally to a review of events leading up to the present chaotic conditions in the transportation field He told the committee that it was dealing with a transportation problem and not just a railroad problem . Dr. Splawn said that the decline in net returns of the railroads are explained in large part by the loss of traffic . He added , however , that this has been accompanied by the retention of a high level of wage rates and a decline in the average revenue per unit of traffic both in the freight service and in the passenger service . The reduction in average charges , he said , has resulted chiefly from competition with other transport agencies . Reviews Railroad Development At the outset of his testimony . Dr. Splawn reviewed the development of the transportation system in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position of the carriers at the present time . Dr. Splawn estimated the investment in transportation agencies at $53,215,000,000 . The importance of the transportation agencies an economic factors , he said , " is shown by the fact that in 1937 they charged or paid for expenses , depreciation and taxes ever $22,000.000 , - 000 . " He referred to the capitalization on the railroads as " a complicated system of wheels within wheels . " Viewing the carriers as one system , with all intercorporate holding eliminated , he said that it appears that the net capitalization on December 31 , 1937 , was $18,319 , - 000,000 , of which $7.069,000.000 ? was stock and $11,250,000,000 unmatured funded debt . These totals , he said . excluded $3,045,000,000 of stock and $2,759,000,000 of funded debt held by some railway companies as investments or as a means of controlling their subsidiaries . The rate of return on railroad investment for 1938. as computed by the ICC . was about 1.67 , , as compared with 2.95,7. for 1937 . Mr. Splawn said . Submitting in tabular form railway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed out that during the period from 1930 to 1938. inclusive , all of the railroads had a net income of about $600,000000 . This amount for the nine years compares with net income of more than $900,000,000 for the single year 1929 , he asserted , and reflects as graphically as can be done the effects of the business depression on the railroads . Cities Importance of Traffic Rise Commissioner Splawn indicated that he believed an increase in traffic would do more to solve the railroad problem than anything else . Pointing out that whereas the railroads in 1929 handled 1,420.000,000 tons of freight and in 1937 moved only 1,075,000.000 tons he said that if the railroads obtain an increase of 20% in traffic above 1937 " the railroad situation will be entirely different " He estimated that of the traffic lost since 1929 about 50 , ; ? of the loss was due to diversion of other agencies and 50 , , ; - due to the depression . He expressed the opinion that with a return to more normal business conditions the railroads may increase their traffic annually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he declared , is to prevent the transportation agencies from falling out among themselves and fighting over the smaller volume of traffic to such an extent as to destroy or permanently impair the huge investments in facilities " which the country will need and probably can utilize profitably in a few years " Illustrating railroad financial plight by use of a map on which railroads failing to meet charges were desigiaated in red , the Commissioner said an increase of 10e ; - to 2007 in traffic would greatly change the complexion of the map .
