Upon French Lick , famed Indiana spa 42 mi. from the centre of U. S. population , converged last week 23 Governors of 23 States for their 23rd annual convention . Through the broad lobby of the big , buff French Lick Springs Hotel , set among wooded hills , they marched back &; forth smoking , joshing , talking politics . They drank Pluto water ( " If nature wo n't , Pluto will " ) at 55 direct from the spring - or piping hot at the hotel buffet . Many were the regretful comments on the absence of their friend , the late great Tom Taggart , Democratic boss of Indiana and millionaire proprietor of this resort. * <P> Governors ' conferences are , by tradition , made as dull and tame as possible by a ban on all " controversial subjects . " <P> But last week 's conference did make big and unexpected news when three Governors rebelled at restraint and dared to debate the debatable in national life . All three are potential contenders for the Presidency . <P> New York 's Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Land Utilization and State Planning . " The bulk of his address was on New York 's reforestation program . But he did manage to preface it with as neat a little political appeal as any of the Governors ever heard , in which he outlined a presidential platform for himself . Naming no names he flayed the Hoover Administration , mentioned the Depression , struck a distinctly national note . Excerpts : <P> " At a time when our country is suffering from a severe dislocation of economic progress , people are naturally asking questions about the future . . . . Some new factor is needed in our economic life . . . . It is not enough to talk about being of good cheer . It is not enough to apply old remedies . . . . r <P> " The ultimate answer is that the Government , both state and national , must accept the responsibility of doing what it can . . . along definitely constructive lines . . . such as scientific tariff aimed to create a movement of world commodities . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . a plan to cut the excessive cost of local government . . . the extension of the principle of insurance to cover sickness and unemployment . . . . " <P> Governor Roosevelt was followed in the afternoon by Pennsylvania 's Republican Governor Gifford Pinchot . The program committee had assigned him a safe and sane topic : " Timber Needs of the Future . " This he swept aside to launch into a tirade against public utilities , his favorite political theme . He warned the Governors of the political domination of the Power Trust . He named four groups : Mellon-Morgan , Insull , North American , Harris-Forbes . These , he said , generated about 95% of U. S. electricity . He predicted their merger into one colossal combination . Excerpts from a speech which got the biggest applause of any at the conference :
