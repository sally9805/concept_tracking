s 0 OFTEN we talked of what we would do when my husband should be emancipated from the burdens of official life . A bicycle tour of Europe was mentioned . lie loved cycling . When at Princeton he used to go abroad during the summers and wheel alone . He used to laugh and tell of one time , in Scotland , when , on a Sunday , he pedaled up to a little kirk to attend the morning service . The pious Scottigh elders looked askance at the stranger 's cycling knickerbockers . He was led to a closed-in pew where this strange and un-Sundaylike garb would not be a distraction to others . Seating him there , an elder took from his pocket a large key and solemnly locked Professor Wilson in . Not until the service was over and everyone else had left the church was the door of the pew unlocked . He yearned for more experiences of that kind . Bicycles were luxuries in Southwestern Virginia when I was a girl , and so I had never learned to ride . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day there arrived at the White House a brand-new wheel . Where to take my lessons was a problem . Obviously not in the White House grounds , whose paths are clearly visible from the surrounding streets . At length Mr. Wilson had it : the White house basement . It is commodious ; and with some clearing away , a space sixty feet long was provided . My husband and a couple of the Secret Service men used to go down with me at night . I fell off several times and nicked the enamel on the new wheel . Though I did not master cycling , we made up for that in laughter and had such hilarious good times that it was genuine recreation for all concerned . Being a country girl at heart , what I needed was more room , and so the cycling lessons were deferred until we should be free to resume them out of doors  --  a day which , alas , never came . A Made-to.Order Congregation NE Sunday during the summer of 1917 the PresikJ dent suggested that we drive quietly over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was the place of worship of George Washington . When we arrived , the little edifice was well filled . Mr. Wilson , my brother Randolph and I were escorted to the Washington pew , given prayer books and left to ourselves . The service over , we were ccconipanied to the door by a member of the vestry and permitted to depart without any of the crowding about which usually attends the appearance of a President in public . Also I was impressed by the large congregation , for it was raining . Afterwards Mr. Jervis , one of the Secret Service men , asked : " May I tell you a story ? " This is the story : Knowing our plans , Mr. Jervis had reached the church at 9:30 , finding it closed and not a soul about . At the nearest house he inquired whether there was to be a service . The man did not know , but said that the preacher was holding Sunday school at his own home and that Jervis might inquire of him . At the minister 's house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barefoot girls and boys . Jervis asked the man whether there would be a service at the church , because the President had intended to come . " The President of what ? " asked the clergyman . " Of the United Stales , " replied Jervis . The minister looked at his caller sorrowfully . " Young man , are you ill ? " he asked . . Jervis showed his badge , adding that the President and Mrs. Wilson were due in an hour . The minister clapped his hands . " Children , Sunday school is dismissed . All of you run home and tell your fathers and mothers the President is coming to church and I want a good congregation to welcome him . " Then he turned to Jervis . " Young man , I must shave . You run over to the church and tell the sexton to ring the bell  --  vigorously . " At the church Jervis found the old sexton opening the door . He gave the minister 's message . The sexton 's mouth stood open for a minute . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's just outside in a tree . I got to go home and shave . " My birthday was on October fifteenth , and my husband 's gift was a ring set with black opal , my birthstone . Two days later John Singer Sargent came to arrange to paint Woodrow 's portrait . Sargent said : " You know , Mrs. Wilson , I have never been so nervous over a portrait in my life . " I looked at him in perfect astonishment . " Why , what do you mean ? " The artist put his hands on the buck of the chair he had chosen for the portrait and leaned his weight on them without replying . I added : " That is surprising from the great Sargent . " I recall his curious expression as he turned and faced me , saying : " Well , I only hope I can do it . " The Story Behind a Portrait ALL this struck me as peculiar , for surely painting a portrait was nothing for Sargent to be nervous about , despite the unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Early in the war , Sargent had donated a canvas at a sale in Londou for the Red Cross , with the understanding that he would pailfrit the portrait of the purchaser or anyone designated by him . The canvas was bought by an Irish gentleman , Sir Hugh Lane , who in the following year lost his life in the sinking of the Lusitania . He left his collection of paintings to the National Gallery in Dublin , and as he had made no suggestion regarding the Sargent canvas , his executors took a popular vote in the British Ialea to determine who would be the subject . Mr. Wilson 's name was on a majority of the ballots . So Mr. Sargent came to this country to paint the portrait for the National Gallery , where it now hangs . My husband said he never worked harder than he did to entertain Sargent while he posed . For all this , the finished portrait was a disappointment to me . I think it lacks virility and makes Mr. Wilson look older than ho did at the time . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I got what may be a clue to the artist 's nervousness . Mr. Henry White said that Sargent had told him that the night before going to the White House he had dined at the home of Son . Henry Cabot Lodge . Lodge had said that he was delighted to hear that Sargent was to do President Wilson 's portrait , as it presented a great opportunity for the artist to serve his party . Everyone knew Sargent 's ability to find in human beings the counterpart of animals , and thus reveal some hidden beastly trait . Lodge said that he knew there was something sinister hidden in Wilson , which he looked to Sargent to reveal to the world . Then , Mr. White told me , the painter turned to him , adding : " I have , therefore , studied the man and tried to probe his very soul . I could find nothing hidden or unworthy . " I tell this story exactly as Mr. Henry White told it to me . Unfortunately , all three men  --  White , Sargent and Lodge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive who know of it . Late in October , Colonel House sailed for Europe at the head of a mission looking toward not only the proper utilization of the growing American effort but to some general revisions of strategy . Ordinarily , the President 's foreign communications were handled by the code room in the State Department , but he and Colonel House had a private code , known , so far as I am aware , only to them and to me . It was used in matters requiring the greatest secrecy , Colonel House himself coding and decoding messages at his end and I performing that service for my husband . While the American mission was on the sea , the Allies suffered two staggering blowsthe Italian defeat at Caporetto and the uprising of the Russian Bolsheviks , who had occupied Petrograd and put the Kerensky government to flight . When Colonel House reached England , things had chauged so unexpectedly and so greatly for the worse that all military plans and programs must be revised . The situation was graver than it had been since 1914 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the American Federation of Labor at Buffalo . Just as we boarded a train at 0:15 in the evening , a - message arrived from Colonel House which my husband and l sat down at once to decipher . We read that at the moment the situation in Allied councils was too uncertain for any definite statement . Parliamentary crises confronted both the French and British governments . With this unsettling news we reached Buffalo in the morning , where the President delivered his prepared address , exuding perfect confidence in victory . Before noon we were rushing back to the capital . Next day came a cable which took me three hours to decode . Colonel House said that the President 's Buffalo speech had made a good impression and had helped the spirits of the Allies . They needed help . Colonel House described the Italian situation as " desperate , " Reports from Russia were more hopeful , however . Kerensky was fighting to regain Petrograd . Possibly resistance to Germany in the east might not collapse , after all . But in any event England , France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang on , awaiting help in the spring from the Americans , and possibly the Russians . In a few days the Russian bubble burst . Kerensky 's troops were beaten and their leader vanished . The Bolsheviks , in power , sued for an armistice . Italy seemed a military liability rather than an asset . America was the Allies ' last and only hope . Thanksgiving Day we attended a service at the Methodist Church , where Bishop AleDowell preached . He paid a tribute to the President which brought an enthusiastic response , such as one seldom hears in a church . On the way home Woodrow was very solemn . He said he appreciated such praise . but that it sobered his spirit . to think of all that was expected of him . Praise , though he enjoyed it as any normal person does , invariably affected my husband thus . It gave him far more concern than the threats of assassination which he constantly received . Occasionally such letters came to me . " Do n't bother over that , " Woodrow would say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act is going to write about it beforehand , and I firmly believe that as long as a man is useful in the world he will survive . So dismiss this as one person at least we do not have to concern ourselves with . " And I did dismiss such things . Looking back , I wonder at my calm , and can only ascribe it to something 1 got from him . Just as cowardice is contagious , so trust in one we love dissipates fear . The only fear Woodrow Wilson knew was the fear of God should he fail in his own duly . For the opening of the Third Liberty Loan the President and I went to Baltimore . Mayor Preston , of Baltimore , said to me in a whisper : " Mrs. Wilson , I want to apologize to you for the absence of my wife . I have received anonymous letters saying this stand will be blown up today , so I would not let her come . Of course I had to . " The Considerate Mayor " Certainly , Mr. Mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is most excusable . " Whereupon , wiping the cold sweat from his brow , he said : " I knew you would understand ; but I did not tell the President , because I did not want to make him nervous , as we may be blown up at any moment . " The supposition being , I suppose , that the wife of the President was free from nerves . With no credit to myself , that happened to be the ease . On December IG , 1917 , I finished my first knitted trench helmet , and that afternoon the President 's cousin , Capt . Woodrow Woodbridge , recently commissioned , called to say good-by . He had orders for France . I gave him the helmet . On the next day Colonel House arrived from Europe . I sat in the study while he gave his first report on the critical situation abroad . The next day , our second wedding anniversary , my husband gave me a lovely bracelet . It wus a happy , busy day . In the morning I sat in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of War and General Bliss , the Chief of Staff , discussed the military situation . Meantime a serious home problem had arisen . The railroads , confronted with labor troubles and an enormous increase of all kinds of traffic , had fallen down . Neither materials nor troops were moving as they should . The President held many consultations , none of which seemed to reach the seat of the difficulty . One night he went alone to consult Mr. Justice Brandeis and shortly thereafter , on December twenty-sixth , took over , in the name of the Government , the control of the railroads , appointing Mr. McAdoo to operate them . Then he prepared a special message to Congress asking legislation fixing the compensation to be paid the roads . A copy of the rough draft was sent to Colonel House for suggestions and comment . Reaching the White I-louse about five one afternoon , the Colonel found the President in a meeting of the War Cabinet . He would not be free until dinnertime . Colonel House approached my door , which was open . I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We sat before the fire , and , taking the paper from his pocket , he waxed eloquent over a thorough disagreement with the entire policy outlined , bringing up some very good reasons for his side . So I said : " Well , we will have an interesting session after dinner , when you take this up with Woodrow . " His answer was : " Suppose you tell him about it first and let him think it over . " Then the Colonel went to dress for dinner . In a few moments I heard my husband 's quick step and ran to meet him at the door . When he saw the tea things , he said : " Oh , you and House have been having a talk . What does he think of my message ? " " He does n't like it at all , " I said . Then I took up , point by point , his comments . Woodrow listened thoughtfully and said : " Oh , I am sorry , but . I will be glad to have him go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me help . " The 14 Points We had dinner , following which we three went to the study for a conference . The President sat down at his desk and , taking out his own copy of the message , said : " Well , Edith tells me you do n't agree with me on this , which is a disappointment , for I have weighed every word of it and put a lot of hard work on it .. But let 's have it . I want your re-actions , " The Colonel was walking about the room , and imagine my surprise when he said in his low voice : " Yes , I did tell Mrs. Wilson that , but she fought so well for your side of the question that I sat down and reread the entire paper before dinner , and agree with every word of it . " I sat perfectly aghast at this , and finally said : " Why , Colonel , you couid n't ! You said ? " " Yes , I know I did , " he interrupted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not like to have people change their minds so quickly , and was never able to forget this little scene . On January 4 , 1018 , the message was delivered as the President had written it . On the afternoon before Christmas , the President had hoped to go with me to Virginia to distribute presents among the children who habitually greeted us on our way to the golf course where we played . The year before we had distributed , I think , seventeen presents . This year the list had grown , and it continued to grow until , the last year we were in the Whitt House , I think it totaled nearly a hundred . A glance at his appointment slip showed the futility of expecting my husband to accompany me : 2:30 Mr , Daniel Willard President , Baltimore &; Ohio Railroad ' 3:00 Senator Kellogg 4:00 Doctor Garfield Fuel administrator 4:30 Swiss Minister 4:45 Secretary of War So Doctor Grayson and I distributed the presents . After dinner the whole family went into the Oval Room and trimmed the Christmas tree . Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Sayres and Madge Elliott were house guests , and later in the day the Joe Wilsons came over from Baltimore . Late in the afternoon there was a special performance for soldiers at Keith 's Theater , which the President wanted to attend . Mother , Margaret , Frank Sayre and I went with him . The matinee lasted until 7:50 , so we had to get into our dinner clothes hurriedly . There were twenty of us , all family : The McAdoos , and my mother , brothers and sisters , in addition to the guests in the house . For some time Mr. Wilson had been trying to get the Allies to join in a statement of their war aims , which should not only constitute a diplomatic offensive by rousing liberal thinkers in enemy countries against their imperial masters , but pave the way to a just peace . These efforts failing , he decided to undertake the task himself . He went to work with Colonel House as his only confidant . The result was the Fourteen Point Address before Congress on January eighth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make peace . No public utterance Mr. Wilson had ever made was received with such general acclaim . Men who , like Theodore Roosevelt , had opposed the President all their public life , praised it . The New York Tribune , hitherto a consistent critic of Mr. Wilson , said : " The President 's words are the words of a hundred million . . . Today , as never before , the whole nation marches with the President , certain alike of the leader and the cause . " In France in the summer of 1913 our men were in the thick of the greatest of battles as the Allies countered the offensive of the Central Powers , who had thrown their all into one more effort to break through to Paris . The dreaded casualty lists darkened the columns of our newspapers . 17 Washington Casualty The President was signing letters and bills with his left hand , the flesh on the inside of his right having literally been burned away in an accident . He had entered an English tank that was being exhibited on the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Being unfamiliar with the interior of the tank , he was looking about for some way to climb up and show himself , when one or the men inside said : " Just take hold of something above you and swing yourself up , " Above him was a series of pipes , one of them nearly red hot and the others cold . The President grasped the hot one . He reached the White House with the flesh of his palm fairly cooked and his teeth sot in agony . An insurance company in which my husband had carried an accident policy for years refused to pay indemnity , on the ground that he was not incapacitated , being able to transact public business as well with his left hand as with his right . I thought the ease should be taken to court , but Mr. Wilson , thinking his office might prejudice the court in his favor , refused . I had joined a Red Cross unit which fed soldiers going through Washington 52 THE SRTURDAY EVENING POST January 14 , 1919 ( Continued from Pasta 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old Baltimore &; Ohio freight depot in what 1 believe to be the hottest spot in Washington . Shifts were on duty day and nigh t . I chose the afternoon shift because that was the only time I could arrange , free from other duties . We wore striped blue-and-white wash uniforms , with large bib aprons , and dark blue hats with white patent-leather bands bearing a red cross in front . Freshly blundered and pressed , these habits looked very businesslike . But after several hours of hard work in the heat they lost some of their crispness , and so did we . On an especially hot day in July we had had train after train of soldiers to feed , and were hot and tired , when one of the men came up to me and said : " Am I right in thinking this is Mrs. Wilson ? " I said : " Yes , you are , and I am mighty glad to tell you how proud the President is of all you boys . " He asked if he could introduce some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he brought them up . Among them was a tall , rawboned fellow , who stood stock-still and looked at me silently for a few minutes , until it became embarrassing . Then he drawled : " Well , buddy , you ca n't string me . That 's not the wife of the President of the United States . " I went toward him and said : " Oh , you think I do n't look the part ? " " I certainly do not , " was his honest reply . This made us all laugh , and I said : " Well , I agree with you ; but when you come back from France , if you will come to the White House I will do my best to look the part and give you such a warm welcome it will convince you . " Sometimes the President would come for me just before dinner . He was always glad when a train was in and he could really see the boys . If possible , he shook hands with each one , and if there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and good luck . " They Also Serve - " One morning in June . Frank Sayre arrived early , quite unannounced . We were at the breakfast table in my little dressing room , and after our welcome and questions concerning . Jessie and the children , he said he must go straight to the War Department to get his orders , as his boat was to sail that night . Woodrow asked : " What sort of orders , Frank ? " When he answered that he had applied for and received a Government appointment in France , the President said : " Why , my dear fellow , you ca n't take that position . It carries a Government salary , and you are my son-in-law . I can not allow you to put either yourself or me in that position . " Poor Frank looked as though the earth had opened before him , for , of course , neither he nor Jessie had thought of it in that light , only welcoming the opportunity to serve . It was a tremendous disappointment to them both , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterwards went over as a Y. M. C. A. worker without remuneration . Since the war George Creel has mentioned this episode in one of his amusing stories . He stretches the truth a little to make a good story , saying that as Frank was going tip the gangplank of a transport the President Look him by the collar and yanked him off . There was also the case of Margaret . From the moment of our entrance into the war the dream of her life had been to go over and sing to our soldiers . Her father was unwilling , saying that she would be another person to feed on the other side and that , being the President 's daughter , she would put a responsibility on the French Government . Tearfully , Margaret accepted this decision . She told me that she felt herself a slacker . The fact is that few women could match the contribution she had made in money alone , remitting to the Red Cross every penny earned on two long and profitable concert tours . As the war drew near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President yielded to her prayers . The husband of a relative of the President had petitioned the War Department for contracts in connection with the building of cantonments . Some of these had been granted , when a friend of the President brought the matter to his attention . Mr. Wilson 's caller said that no matter how remote the family connection or how just the contracts , the situation might give rise to criticism . Years later this friend told me the story of the interview . " I felt I owed it to the President to go and tell him , but . boy , it took all the nerve I had If he had not seen the thing as I did , I would have been thrown out of the White House headfirst . It turned out that I knew my man . The President rose , put out his hand and thanked me . That jaw of his was set as he said , ' It must be stopped at once . ' " Unhappily , the family of the man whose contracts were canceled could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The President 's action made a breach that has never been healed . I mention this only to show the small worries and misunderstandings which increased the burden of the man who so wearily said to me , over and over : " You see , everything that comes to me is a problem . Things that go right take care of themselves . " Nothing was harder for him than hurting or reproving anyone he cared for , but , obedient to a sense of duty , the personal grief was put aside and he steered a straight course . I think this side of my husband 's nature has never been fully understood . He could mark a line of cleavage between what was personal and what was official , and no matter whether the decision was against family or friend , it must stand . No one who knew him needs my testimony of the sorrow such Spartan courage gave him , but to the stranger I hope it will explain why friendships were terminated or close contacts checked . " Too Proud to Fight " The phrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too proud to fight " ? surely applied to himself ; for he kept silent under attack , often preferring to bear the blame rather than expose a false friend or bungling member of his official family . When I would sometimes remonstrate , he would say : " Truth is no cripple . She can manage , for if I had done otherwise I could not have lived with myself , and you must admit . it is wiser to have the consent of my own conscience than to stoop to justify myself at the expense of the other fellow . " The twenty-four hours of the day would have been insufficient to have seen all those who sought audiences or pressed on the President , and on me , the acceptance of invitations . Would we attend this , inspect that , address the other ? My husband did as much of this sort of thing as he could , and so complete was the discipline of his mind that often it afforded real recreation . Mr. Wilson was a dyed-in-the-wool baseball fan . He has told me how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climb the fence and watch games when he could not spare a quarter for a ticket . Once I took my knitting  --  war knitting  --  to a game and he was scandalized . How one could knit and watch a baseball game was beyond him . Returning from the Red Cross game , he found Doctor Garfield waiting with ominous news about the shortage of coal for the ships . " Oh , hang it all , Garfield , " lie said , " I have just been to a ball game , and I wish I could say three strikes and out to this job . " About this time I received a , note from M. Jusserand , saying that the French Government wished to present to me a small piece of Gobelin tapestry made at the state factory . After consulting may husband I wrote the Ambassador of my appreciation , adding that while we did not usually accept valuable gifts , this was such a gracious tender on the part of his government that I would be pleased to accept it in the spirit offered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask for an appointment in order to present it in person . Two or more weeks passed , and in the press of other things I had forgot ten about the tapestry , when the embassy telephoned that the package had arrived . I sent a note asking the Ambassador and Madame Jusserand to tea the next day , if they should be free . I asked if we could send for the package and have it opened at the White House before they came . This was arranged , but I was at the canteen that afternoon and did not get home until just time to change and receive our callers . We had tea in the Green Room , and I remember how cool and serene it seemed after the heat and bustle of the canteen . About six the President joined us . I said to the faithful Hoover , who had just announced my husband : " Please bring the piece of tapestry to the Ambassador . " Hoover 's face was a study . " Oh , " he said , " I took the liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is difficult to move . " Taking in the situation at a glance the Ambassador said , in his quizzical way : " You did not see the package ? I think it is easier for us to go to the mountain than for it to come to us . " So we all moved through the door leading into the East Room , where , on the floor , stretching eighteen and a half by fifteen feet , lay a royal piece of Gobelin tapestry . Aghast , I exclaimed : " But you said a small piece , Mr. Ambassador ! " " Yes , I did , " he replied , " but I had not seen it . " Then I said : " But I could not accept this . It is far too valuable . Perhaps your government meant it for the White House  --  surely not as a personal gift for me . " " No , not at all , " he answered . " My instructions are that it is absolutely for you . " The President suggested that M. Jusserand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our part in thinking it only a small piece , and say that with their permission I would accept it and leave it in the White House when his term expired . Fully understanding our position , the Ambassador agreed to do this . My husband added : " As a matter of fact , any gift to the White House must be approved by the Congress , but I am sure there would be no difficulty there , so we wo n't take that up until we get . the consent of your government . " The First Air Mail Personal matters were not acted on promptly in any country during the war . So it was late in September when I received a letter from the Ambassador saying he had instructions from his government to the effect that " in no circumstances is the tapestry to be left at the White House . " It was sent , and accepted beforehand , as a personal gift ; and they would be deeply hurt if it were now rejected . This was an embarrassment , but there was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So the gift was mine , and has been a source of genuine pleasure to me ever since . Mr. Burleson , the Postmaster General , sent us a pass and , on May 15 , 1918 , the President and I went to Potomac Park to witness the inauguration of the first air-mail route  --  between Washington and New York . I sent to Mrs. William A. Bartlett , an aviation enthusiast of New York , a thimble which weighed one ounce . The postage was forty-eight cents . After taking off , the plane circled the White House grounds and the pilot dropped a ( Continued on Page 54 ) THE SATURDAY EVENING POST January 04,1935 r Continued tram Pogo 52 ) cluster or roses , with u nice message of greeting . On his return he brought me I a post card from a friend which carried a twenty-four-cent air-mail stamp ; also a stunning corsage of orchids from the firm of J. II . Small &; Sons , florists . That autumn the President and I witnessed our first demonstration of wireless communication with an airplane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounds . Mr. Wilson was asked to direct the maneuvers of a. fleet of planes overhead . He spoke into the microphone and his orders were obeyed by the planes . " Well , I have seen it , and taken part in it , " he said , " but still I ca n't believe it possible . " On August fifth I christened one of the hundreds of ships for which I had the honor to select names . It was the first to leave the ways at Hog Island . This one was named Quistconck , which in the Indian tongue means " Hog Island . " As I stood on the platform and thought of the fate it might meet . at the hands of a submarine . I could not help a little catch in my voice as I said : " I christen you Quisteonek . " Then I swung my bottle of champagne , which was so hot that Mr. ' harks M.

Coming home , our train was delayed for a few minutes in the tunnel at . Baltimore , and I thought I might . die . Many times after that day , when the sun was beating down on us at Washington , I thought of those shipbuilders toiling at their tasks , and Felt they were as heroic as many who earned a rifle . Returning from Hog Island , there was just time for a blissful tub before greeting the first guests to arrive for the wedding of Alice Wilson , the President 's niece . Alice 's parents lived in an apartment . in Baltimore , and a wedding would have been such an undertaking for them that I suggested it be held in the White House . The President 's daughters , thinking only of their father 's ? onifort , opposed this , but Woodrow wanted the girl to have a nice wedding . Only relatives of the bride and the groom were asked , but these were sufficient to fill the White lIouse . Tropical ; Yodeling Nearly all of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dreadfully hot . They seemed ill at ease , and so , in view of the event of the morrow , I proposed early bed for everyone and got them all off to their rooms at 9:30 . Then I ordered a ( ' Sr sent around to the Treasury entrance , and my husband and I stole out through a basement door and had a lovely ride . Next day was worse than ever . Guests were still coming , and Margaret generously volunteered to meet the trains . I shall never forget one relative of the groom . She arrived in a tailored suit , skirt and coat , with a starched , high-collared waist , and not a hair turned from the heat . While we were all suffocating in the thinnest of white dresses with open necks , this lady really seemed comfortable a ! she sat bolt upright on the edge of a chair and said sho preferred hot tan to iced lemonade ! Evening brought no relief from the torrid temperature . So , as there were only family guests , my husband and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of formal dress ; for it did not seem humanly possible to put on a stiff shirt and black , long-tailed coats . Our suggestion was scouted . No indeed , full dress was essential , decreed the mother of the bride . My poor , long-suffering husband and all the other men yielded , but I should hate to speculate on what their thoughts must have been . Photographers were on hand ; and as the light was still good at seven o'clock , they insisted upon photographing the bride on the south portico . In all her white mystery of tulle , she was posed . Just as they were ready to snap the cameras , out of the quivering heat came a perfect tornado . It was alarming . Without premonition , the wind caught Alice 's veil and wrapped it around a railing , stripped the green awnings from their iron frames , and sent men and cameras flying in every direction . Gasloss Sundays The poor bride was rescued and repaired . The wind was followed by torrents of rain and forks of lightning and ominous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delicious coolness which follows such storms made us all feel that life was still sweet and worth while . The White House observed wheat-less and meatless days , and all the rest . The grounds supported a flock of sheep to add its modicum to the wool production . On September first a request from the Fuel Administrator to conserve gasoline brought a presidential plea for " gasless Sundays " ? no pleasure driving . This was on Saturday , and the following day we set forth to church in an ancient victoria , found in the White House stables and hastily polished up . But the Secret Service men were put to it to discover anything to carry them . Finally an old-time surrey , with fringe around the top , was procured . The two smartly uniformed motorcycle policemen who , since the declaration of war , had been detailed to escort the President 's ear were mounted on bicycles . Thus it was that we started for the Presbyterian Church through silent , empty streets  --  no noise , no traffic . Sidewalks were filled with churchgoers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but their greetings were warm and generous . The bicycle men had the hardest part , for our journey was uphill , and we told the coachman to slow up his horses . My husband said he loved the leisure and quiet of the streets , and sometimes , on subsequent Sundays , we would drive in Rock Creek Park . The first time none of us thought of the ford until we missed our police escort , for the water was far too deep for bicycles and they had to make a long detour . After that we were more considerate and chose another road . What I have undertaken in this chapter is to describe a few personal everyday things in order to convey some idea of the intimate life of ' the occupants of the White House during the most thrilling weeks of the World War . The trivial incidents here related took place against the heroic background of the greatest of all American military efforts . Two million men were in France , half of them on the fighting front . In July the German advance upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in retreat . Every day brought glorious news  --  glorious until one turned to the casualty lists . At eleven o'clock on the morning of Monday , October seventh , the Swiss minister delivered a note from the German Government asking for an immediate armistice and requesting the President of the United States to initiate peace proposals on the basis of his Fourteen Points . This was glorious news . We were giving a luncheon that day for the British Ambassador and a party of thirteen . At nine Colonel House arrived from New York . Despite the fact that every moment of his time seemed to have been filled , the President had ready the trial draft of a reply to the Germans , which he discussed with Colonel House and the Secretary of State until after midnight . I believe the next four weeks were the most feverish of the war . There was a catch in the original German proposal by which they hoped for an armistice in order to re-form their armies and resume fighting to better advantage . The Allies ' job was to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the earliest moment . All the negotiations on the Allied side were conducted by the President . Colonel House left for Paris at once to represent him at the scene of action . Cables flew between them constantly , and I worked early and late coding and decoding . The tension was not lessened by the fact that we knew the end was near . On Thursday forenoon , No ; sember seventh , whistles and sirens begun to blow and people to flood the streets . Newspaper headlines proclaimed the signing of the Armistice . A jubilant throng stormed the White House with bands playing and hats thrown into the air . I ran to the President 's study and begged him to come to the portico and greet the people . He said that he could not . Ile knew that no Armistice had been signed . He could not make himself a party to the celebration of false news of victory . Of course I , too , knew that the news was premature . But the President 's decision , right though it was , greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I simply could stand no longer to have no part in it . In an open ear I picked up mother and my sister Bertha , thinking we would drive down Pennsylvania Avenue and watch the crowds . No sooner was the ear recognized than the throngs surged around us . I was glad that I had come out to take my place among all the other Americans who had stood behind their President during the war . My only regret was that he was not there . November Eleventh The next days were spent quietly . On Sunday , November tenth , we went to the Presbyterian Church for the morning service , had luncheon alone , and waited anxiously for the confirmation that the Armistice had actually been signed . In the evening mother , Bertha and Randolph came to dinner , but we were all too excited to settle down . About ten o'clock they decided to return to their hotel . My husband and I went out to the elevator with them , and mother said to Woodrow : " I do wish you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I wish I could , " he answered , " but I fear the Drawer ; it always circumvents me . Wait just a moment until I look . " He came back in a minute or two with four or five long code cablegrams which he handed to me , saying : " This is your tusk , and I have many others ; so there is no rest in sight for either of us yet . " Randolph said : " Let me stay and help you , Edith . " Before I could answer , Woodrow said : " Indeed you can help her , and I will be very grateful . " So after seeing mother and Bertha to the car Woodrow went to the study , and Randolph and I to the big table in the west hall , where we worked out the messages , taking the last one to the study about one A.M. The President was still at his desk , and eager for the news we brought . My recollection is that this principally concerned the expressed desire of M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peace negotiations that would ensue . Two hours later , at three A.M. , Monday , November eleventh , came the long-awaited news  --  the Armistice was signed ! The guns were still ! The World War was ended ! Many persons have asked me what we did , and all I can answer is , we stood mute -- unable to grasp the full significance of the words . .9 President Keeps Faith When confirmation of the actual signing reached the public , pandemonium broke out afresh . At L2:45 we left . for the Capitol , where the President made the formal announcement of the Armistice . At four o'clock we reviewed a parade of war workers , and at . 8:30 drove out again to watch the celebrants . The Secret Service men were powerless to stem the crowds , which swamped the car until soldiers locked arms and formed a ring about us , in the center of which we moved slowly hack to the White House . November eleventh happened also to be the birthday of the King of Italy . The Italian Ambassador and Countess Cellere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not the custom for the President to be invited to foreign embassies , but , in the exhilaration of the moment , my husband proposed going . We dressed and left the White House again at . 10:50 , driving unannounced to the embassy on Sixteenth Street .. The President toasted the health of the King , and we stayed for about an hour . But the day had been so crowded with emotion that when we returned we were too excited to sleep . So , kindling up the fire in my room , we sat on a couch and talked until the early hours of morning . Then my husband read a chapter in the Bible and went to bed . Early in the days after we entered the war , the President had publicly urged our troops to keep alive their faith in God , and feel that they were crusaders in a just and holy cause . Once he received a company of soldiers at the White House and talked along the same lines to them . One man spoke up : " You would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , no matter how busy you are , would you ? " " I will , with all my heart , " the President answered . Then the boy said : " Well , I know it will make it easier for us to do it if we can count on you . " I wonder how many of those gallant young souls kept . the faith as scrupulously as did my husband . The Y.M.C.A. got out a pocket edition of the Bible , covered with khaki , a copy of which the President used , for it had been sent to him by a soldier . No mutter how late the hour or how weary the brain , he never slept until he had kept the promise made .
