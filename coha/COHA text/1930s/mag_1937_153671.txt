When the Fascist ax &; rods drove the Lion of Judah from his Ethiopian home , Benito Mussolini was faced with grueling transport problems . Only means of carrying food , garrison troops and colonists from the Red Sea coast to Ethiopia 's capital was by the Djibouti-Addis Ababa railroad , 494 mi. of rough , single-track , narrow-gauge roadbed over which crawled rattling , second-hand rolling stock to a terminus in French territory . <P> With the thoroughness that has marked all Italian road-building enterprises since the days of Gaius Julius Caesar , Mussolini massed 100,000 Italian workmen , organized them as units of the Fascist Militia to give them dignity in the eyes of Ethiopia 's Semitic blackamoors , set them to work digging . <P> The most important highway planned was to stretch for 800 mi. from Asmara- linked to the Red Sea by a short Italian railroad-through Dessie to Addis Ababa . It was to be wide enough for four lines of traffic , durable enough to withstand big rains , which every summer since the days of Pharaoh have made Ethiopia a 100% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long was to link Debarech in the country 's deep interior and Gondar , an important town 25 mi. north of vital Lake Tana , which empties its waters into the Blue Nile , feeds British irrigation works in the Sudan . <P> By last week both roads were finished . Proudly Il Duce ordained for the bigger one the honor of an official opening .
