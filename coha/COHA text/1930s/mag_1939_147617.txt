For 115 years the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia ( founder : Benjamin Franklin ) has gone solidly about its business of promoting science and industry . To many a famed scientist , engineer , inventor have gone its awards for work that advanced their professions . Like other kudos-conferring bodies , the Institute has never tried to bestow kudos-where-kudos-is-due among ordinary businessmen . This week the Institute stepped out , announced that from now on it would recognize the science of industrial management . <P> Its new award : the Vermilye Medal , named for Donor William Moorhead Vermilye , vice president of Manhattan 's National City Bank . The first recipient : Lewis Herold Brown , handsome ( see cut ) young ( 45 ) president of big Johns-Manville Corp . ( building materials , etc . ) . Until the presentation ceremony two weeks hence , the Institute will not reveal its bill of particulars in favor of Mr. Brown . It hardly needs to then . <P> Made head of a feast-or-famine business in 1929 , Lewis Brown pulled it through the century 's worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The New Deal 's Monopoly Committee regarded J.M. under him as an example of enlightened management in Big Business ; he was summoned to Washington at the beginning of Depression II to give his views to Franklin Roosevelt . Neatest trick of all , Johns-Manville has C. I. O. , A. F. of L. and independent unions scattered through its plants , firmly opposes closed shop , is at present on good terms with all its labor .
