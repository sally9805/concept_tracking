txt The Resources Bureau of the cabinet has been studying formation of a. - JapanManchukuo economic bloc . A rough - draft of the plan has been made . After the ? ebb:et-rainlater/ have revised it an attempt will be - made " to harmonize the various private interests involved . Japanese Imperialists nave dreamed tins dream for years . Even before Manchukuo independence was declared in March they stopped dreaming and began talking . The manifesto circulated by young army and navy officers on the night of the assassination of Premier Tsuyoshi Inukai  --  May 15 ? demanded such an economic bloc as an essential . The military want it- Most of the people mink they do . When an attempt is made  --  some months or years hence  --  to form the union it will be interesting to see what happens to the open door principle . Putting the plan into effect will not be easy , for there is sharp conflict among industrial interests . Operation of the plan after its initiation is apt to be disastrous , for the Japanese farmer can not compete with the Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tariff barriers is apt to prove his undoing . Raw Materials for aspen The basic plan of the Resources Bureau , according to accounts in the vernacular press , is that Manchukuo shall supply raw materials for Japan to process and refine . Manchukuo will get manufactured articles in return for its raw materials . But Manchuria now produces certain refined materials which compete with the Japanese , and there has been a general rush on the part of Japanese companies to establish plants there . Moreover , Japan *produces raw materials with which Manchukuo products compete successfully . It is recognized that legislative power will have to be exercised to solve these difficulties if they are to be settled at all . Chief of the competitive lines is coal . The Fushun open cut mine of the South Manchurian Railway Co. produces better and cheaper coal than the mines in Japan . If it were not held down by the government it could force every Japanese producer out of business in a year or so . But it is held down , allowed to ship but 1,500,000 tons a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save jobs for the Japanese coal miners . If the ' Resources Bureau plan goes into effect , all the Japanese coal mines , theoretically , will have to be closed down and their operators reimbursed . Manchurian iron now is excluded from the Japanese market by high tariffs . But the Anshan Iron Works of the South Manchuria Railway Co. is able to sell its products to Germany and other overseas buyers , while , even with the yen 52% below par , the Japanese smelters can not do so . With the tariff between the two countries removed , the Japanese plants in Japan proper and Korea will probably have to shut down . Ammonium and Salt Competition There is also competition in ammonium sulphate . Last year Japan proper and Korea supplied 599.000 tons of the demand of 821,368 tons within the empire . This year imports are falling and home producers are caring for almost all the demand . But they are afraid of Manchuria . The South Manchuria Railway has announced a plan to build a plant near Dairen to turn out 170,000 tons a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10,000,000 . Work would be started in April and completed in two years . Private producers in Japan proper know that by-product ammonium sulphate of the S. M. R. is now underselling them and are certain that the new plant , built at a time of cheap costs and employing Chinese labor , would cut severely into their market . They are complaining in the press and pulling political strings to have the project prohibited by the government . Salt also competes but , since this is a government monopoly in Japan , little trouble would be likely . Lumber is another possible source of competition . Big Japanese interests have had large timber tracts in eastern Kirin Province for years but have never been able to develop them . Now , with a friendly administration in Changchun and a railway soon to be finished between Kirin and Katnei , connecting with the Korea ports of Seishin and Yuki , they will be able to get their goods to market . All these matters , of course , can be ironed out by orders of the two governments , providing Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is a probability , however , that the military will not wish to follow it to its logical conclusion . They will not wish to close all the coal mines and to shut down all the iron smelters in Japan proper , for , after all , Anshan and Fushun are pretty far away in the event of trouble . Agriculture Greatest Problem But in these matters formulas can be worked out and applied . The big trouble will come from agriculture . Japanese farmers have tried time and again to compete with the Chinese . They have been taken to Manchuria , placed on farms along the railway , given tools and seeds and told to go to it . In the pa , st they have never succeeded . In Japan the average farm is of 2.67 acres . It is hard to estimate the size of the average Manchurian farm . Cultivated area is 37,644,625 acres and the population is roughly 30,000,000 . Assuming , for the sake of argument , that the average Chinese family numbers five and that all are on the land ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm is at least six acres in extent . Twelve acres is probably nearer the truth . The untouched arable tracts are immense . Even without elimination of tariff barriers between Manchukuo and Japan , the farm products of the former are apt to become embarrassing to the latter in a year or so . This year they will not , for the disastrous floods in the most fertile area , that of North Manchuria , have reduced crops tremendously . Moreover , the failure of the Japanese to restore any semblance of order has kept settlers from staking out claims and opening up new areas . With a return of orderly conditions , the agricultural development of Manchuria is certain to continue . Leading exports of Japan to Manchuria so far this year have been raw cotton ( re-exported ) , cotton cloth , wheat flour , paper , refined sugar , old gunny sacks , fruits and vegetables , fish , iron and steel products including hardware and machinery , rayon textiles , cement , prepared lumber , electric equipment and lamps and glass , Until September 25 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter of import and export tariffs and tonnage dues , Japan was selling 40% of the imports into South Manchuria and China 30% . They were competing principally in cotton textiles , silk textiles , vegetables , soap , matches and paper . With both countries on an equal basis , China is expected to lose a large share of its trade with Newchwang and Dairen . The South Manchuria Railway is trying to get government approval for a plan to increase its capitalization from Y. 404,000,000 to Y. 808. - 000,000 or ** in order to finance its many new enterprises . Since the new shares probably would be issued a quarter paid , this means that the company wants between Y. 100 , - 000,000 and Y. 150,000,000.
