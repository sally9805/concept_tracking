txt The formation of an all-American committee to deal with the commercial relations between the nations of the Western Hemisphere has been suggested to the delegates of the Fourth Pan-American Commercial Conference here by Mr. Tlininnn r .. etind. bourne of New York , author of the plan ' to restore a balance between the production and consumption of sugar . Following closely upon a similar suggestion made by the Costa Rica delegation , the plan is of particular significance , since it reveals a sameness of thought , between the peoples of the northern and southern republics It is expected that the recommendation will go before the conference early next week for an expression of opinion and vote . It will first be considered in group sessions . Mr. Chadbourne declared that he did not believe the League of Nations could ever confer the benefits upon the two Americas that could be bestowed by a permanent group selected from each of the countries belonging to the Pan-American Union . As an adjunbt to the main committee he suggested another committee to investigate the cultural , educational and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen from among persons connected with the public school system of each Latin-American nation . Program outlined The specific work in which the main committee would devote its attention would be confined to attempts to : ( 1 ) Study what stands in the way of a Pan-American customs union and what would have to be done to remove the obstacles  --  that is , what most-favored-nation treaties , if any , exist between the American iepublics and countries outside the American continents . ( 2 ) Study the trade between the United States and each of the countries to find out what effect free trade would have on each commodity , what public works are advisable in the next 10 years in Latin America , and what would have to be done to finance them , both with respect to insuring the existing debts and financing the Lew requirements . ( 3 ) Study the situation with respect to commerce between the Amel ican republics and the possibility of so changing our laws as to make it possible for American ships in Pan-American trade to be manned to a greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public debt  --  governmental , state and municipnl  --  of each of the Latin-Antercinn republics , looking to a final refunding of the debt of the iepublics desiring it , under the rests of the credit of the United States . Great Opportunity Offered Not in all history has any group of . nations been offered greater opportunity and happiness , Mr. Chadbourne said . The surplus money of the United States can not longer be invested in public improvements or vital factors for comfortable living ; these already exist in the states . Surpluses must therefore find markets abroad . The Latin-Amdrican nations , on the other hand , while developing enormous wealth , have not , he pointed out , accumulated surpluses sufficient to supply capital to be loaned . Nearly all the southern republics need funds with which to expand . Cities , towns and villages need eleptric lights , water systems , sea ? lege. pavements and transportation facilities , including railways , highways , canals and ports . Agriculture , he said , although it has reached great development in such nations as At gentina , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in its infancy , he pointed out . Money and credit therefore , he said , are needed , and it is the United States which should supply both , since Latin America 's use of such would build customers , ' and not competitors , for the states . Referring to the progress made by the United States through its vast building enterprise , Mr. Chadbourne explained " our construction of public works upon such a vast scale has bred in our country an amazing group of experts who can give to Latin America advice on system and materials and which will save the iepublics from costly errors of inexperience . Have What Others Need " We have steamers representing millions of tons of carrying capacity lying idle in our ports . Latin America has no merchant fleet for the mobilization of the products it exports , or for tile merchandise it imports . The shipping it uses is , with few exceptions , from regular lines under different flags which charge questionable rates for freight , and the United States , as a result , pays dearer for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds costs hoisted in the merchandise sent south by the United States . " The shipping of the United States is out of commission today partly because there is too much shipping in the world , but mainly  --  because it costs too Mitch to operate an American ship under the existing shipping laws . " Latin America , Mr. Chadbourne decided , appears thus far to have what the United States needs and the United States has what Pan-American nations require commercially . Pointing to the geographical situation he went on to say that Latin-American nations could provide an ample and virtually exclusive ' market for United States goods , and in sufficient volume to do away in part with the curtailment in production , the necessity for which is now being considered . ' The-size of this northern market , he said , can only be understood by those persons who have studied it . Few persons realize that the United States of America , with its 2,9$3,774 square miles , could be tucked away in Brazil which covers 3,286,170 square miles . Populations Similar - our last census , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' of over 122,000,000 ; the combined total population of your republics is nearly the same . The density of our ' population is 41.3 prisons per square mile ; Guatemala has a density of 51.3 , the Dominican Republic 62.1 , Cuba 81.5 , Salvador .13 0 . 8 and Haiti 249.8 , " If we look at railroad systems we find that the miles of railway per 1000 square miles reach 83.8 in the United States . No republic of the south reaches this figure . The highest is Cuba with 69.7 , and the lowest Venezuela with 1.5 . As to the proportion of railways with population , the figure of the United States is 2 01 , and Latin-American figures range from Argentine 's 2.08 to Haiti 's .06 . " Turning to foreign trade , which shows the activities of peoples as well nS their wealth , the total export per capita of the United States is $42.70 . This figure is surpassed by Uruguay with $49.50 , Chile with $63 , Cuba with $76 , and Argentina with $85.10 , which means that each citizen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exports ) twice the amount of each citizen of the United States . " Coming to the imports , the per capita In the United States is $39.90 , a figure surpassed by Costa Rica , Panama , Chile , Uruguay , Cuba and the Argentine , which has $73.40 , more than twice the amount ' of each citizen of tine United States . In-the total foreign trade we are at $78.60 , with Argentina high above liS at 6158.50 .. Japan Has Little to Offer Further surveying the geographical situation , Mr. Chadbourne said that Japan has little to offer the United States since its disposition is competitive because Japan is concerned with Its own industrial development , Chinn , he said , is upset by revolutions " and nobody can do more than guess as to when they will be ended . " The remainder of Asia is tinder either the British French or Dutch , Turning to Russia lie declared that that nation is a lingo question mark , but that as the Soviet nation develops its resources , which in ninny ways parallel those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States greatest competitor if the United States con-Bums dealing with the European rind Asiatic continents . Australia , ho explained , is completely British , end Africa is a conglomeration of European colonies , except , Liberia , which is of no great importance , Europe , he said , instead of being field for the United States is Its principal competitor in every line of business , because industrially it As hist as well equipped as the United States . Its provision of raw materials is even easier , he said , in view of the fact that countries like France and England can secure such materials from their colonies and under better conditions than the United Slates can obtain them . " Therefore , " lie concluded , " by the process of elimination we arrive at the decision that the only continent open for our trade and influence is Latin-America , that is , the countries of the Western Hemisphere other than the United States and Canada . At no point is there anything like such a conflict between the production of the Latin-American countries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the European and Asiatic continents and ourselves .
