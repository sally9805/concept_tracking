txt TAXICAB PRACTICES . Action of Control Board in Calling Attention to Them Is Commended . To the Editor of The New York Times : I read with amazement today the report of a hearing before the new Taxicab Board of Control giving in detail some of the practices in vogue in the operation of cabs to escape liability . But more surprising to me is the apparent assistance given to irresponsible operators by the big corporations in selling cabs on a shoestring basis . Does not the maker of taxicabs assume a moral liability when he fails to look into the ultimate use to which his cabs are to be put ? If X sells several hundred cabs to Y and knows that Y has at six different times switched his corporate name and has no bank account in the name of the corporation buying the cabs , how can X justify such a business deal ? The Board of Control is to be highly commended for bringing to light such a state of affairs , and it looks as though the public is now going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual or corporation engaged in public transportation to whom we entrust our lives should not be made to show responsibility before he gets his license . The announced purpose of the Board of Control to put the cab business on the plane of a public utility should meet the approval of citizens . The board has taken the right steps to win public confidence . RALPH N. TAYLOR . New York , May 5 , 1932.
