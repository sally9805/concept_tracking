The Princeton Triangle Club is primarily a social institution whose largest purpose is to give the more talented members of Cottage Club , Cap and Gown and Tiger Inn a 3,000-mile booze bust around the country at Christmastime . Not all Triangle show boys are out exclusively for a good time , however , and it is this type which goes out into the cold world and becomes actors , singers and directors like James Stuart , Joshua Logan , Ned Wever , Frank Chapman , Phillips Holmes , Myron McCormick , Bretaigne Windust , Jose Ferrer . These have created in the Triangle Club a small but sound tradition of showmanship which the 49th annual production - Fol- De- Rol , which began its tour* in <P> Princeton last week-did nothing to tarnish . There are many elements to a musical show-music , lyrics , libretto , costumes , sets , dancers , singers , comics . It is not algebraically likely that any college production would excel in each department each year . But Fol-De-Rol bats a very satisfactory .500 or better . <P> This year 's Triangle show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called to the throne from his nightshirt , wants to purchase the Isle of Blight , a French channel patch . As buying agents he sends the Duke of Clarendon , a villain with designs on the King 's throne , and the Countess of Sessex , a villainess with designs on the King 's person . The plots of Triangle shows rarely jell , they coagulate . This one is no exception . Stopfidget , a scurrilous rakehell who has been exiled to Blight , flies back to England with his hungry balloonist friend , Sweazle . The crown jewels are stolen . Clarendon grabs the throne . London burns . The feminine plebs , weary of the Duke of Clarendon 's despotism , picket him with ribald signs : Unfair to Organized Love ; We Want Charles ; Want Him BAD . Charles is restored and the " semi-opera " ends with the cast singing , as usual , Old Nassau . <P> The first-night audience gave its usual delighted applause to Fol-De-Rol 's tuneful numbers , sophisticated sets and costumes , its elaborate , manfully executed dance maneuvers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-horsed lines , admired the direction of Graduate Jose Ferrer , applauded the trouper hardihood of Actors Richard Cowdery and Richard Baer . It also enjoyed the minor accidents incidental to a Triangle Show first night : hats falling off sighing lovers , and dummy legs falling off hobbyhorses , a mob scene 's mob missing its cue , spotlights searching frantically for actors bravely singing in the dark . <P> Since the late Brooks Bowman wrote the nationally successful East of the Sun , Triangle songsmiths have had a hard song to beat . Fol-De-Rol is at least full of very good ones , complete with new-fangled long coda endings . When Your Heart 's on Fire , by Dixon Morgan and C. E. Davis , seems particularly tuneful , and the ballet music has real distinction . <P> *Towns to be visited in the next three weeks : New York , Philadelphia , Baltimore , Pittsburgh , Cincinnati , Louisville , Columbus , St. Louis , Kansas City , Omaha , Chicago , Detroit , Cleveland , Albany and Montclair.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
