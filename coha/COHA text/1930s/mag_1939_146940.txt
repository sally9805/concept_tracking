At 10 a.m. one morning last week , in the caucus room of the Old House Office Building , there opened a Congressional investigation as suave , sophisticated , polite and cynical as a Somerset Maugham comedy . It was the beginning of the Smith Committee hearings of the Wagner Act-that most crucial piece of New Deal legislation , passed to safeguard labor 's historic right to bargain collectively through unions of its own choosing . <P> Last July Congress authorized the Smith Committee to investigate the Wagner Act , to find out whether the Labor Board had been fair , to see what amendments , if any , were needed , and gave it $50,000 as a starter . To tall , solemn , silent Representative Howard Smith of Broad Run , Va. , who has hated the New Deal ever since it tried to purge him last year , it gave the delicate job of chairman . With wealthy Lawyer Edmund Toland and 22 attorneys assisting ( called brilliant legal lights by the Right , called tools of reaction by the Left ) , it checked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labor Relations Board , the doings of its 22 regional offices , its 109 field examiners , its 10,000 cases a year . Last week , with a formal flourish , Mr. Smith pulled back the curtains on his show . <P> Comedy . The Dies Committee hearings made a rip-roaring Texas melodrama full of spies , plots , trap doors , enemy agents , hairbreadth escapes , made thunderous by howls of pain from the injured , cries of outrage from the accused-a breathless drama of pure Americanism versus nobody quite knew what , packed with sordid procedures , damnable outrages , cries of " Unhand-me-Martin-Dies ! " from radicals , and " Let that poor girl go ! " from liberals-and all galloping over the cliff at the end of each installment . The Smith Committee hearings were drawing-room comedy . <P> First witness was pipe-smoking Dr. William Leiserson , 56 , appointed to the Board eight months ago , with a reputation as a labor mediator . Dr. Leiserson stated the case for NLRB about as well as it has been stated . He denied that the Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that brought about the Act-the use of labor spies , the discrimination against good union men , the tragedies of violence in labor disputes , the old hostility against labor legislation . <P> He admitted faults and weaknesses in its administration . But , he said , " It seems strange to me that almost every day we should be reading of attacks on the Board and its personnel , but hardly anyone ever thinks of attacking those employers . . , who have flouted the law of Congress . . . . " <P> The Smith Committee adroitly dodged challenging labor 's rights or employers ' wrongs . With its tongue in its cheek and its eye on the record , it examined the labor relations of the experts on labor relations , asked the old Roman Juvenal 's question : " Quis custodiet ipsos custodes " or Who will guard the " SG- &-SO"; guardians ?
