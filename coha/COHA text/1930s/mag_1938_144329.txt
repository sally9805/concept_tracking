Railroad presidents who sigh when they think of the magnificent open-field technique of Vanderbilt , Harriman , Gould and Hill , sighed again last week when Leonor Fresnel Loree , on the point of turning 80. resigned as president of Delaware &; Hudson Co . Mr. Loree has a beard and a ferocious scowl . But despite his age and looks , he was always only on the fringes of the swashbuckling , end-of-the-century railroad men who ran railroads , the stock-market and a few States . He was a Harriman man , less of a giant than a tall man with aspirations . <P> Once he worked for the Pennsylvania . Then he was president of Baltimore &; Ohio , and after that of Rock Island . In 1907 Harriman picked him for Delaware &; Hudson , which ran 870 miles " from nowhere to nowhere " ( meaning from Wilkes-Barre , Pa. to Montreal ) . He already was head of a " right of way and two streaks of rust " - Kansas City Southern , from Kansas City to Port Arthur , Texas . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more happened till Harriman died and the Interstate Commerce Commission began talking consolidation . <P> Time &; again Mr. Loree tried to connect his two roads . Time &; again the Commission shook its head . In the 1920s he inconspicuously bought into small Eastern lines like the Lehigh Valley and the Wabash , presented the Commission with a plan for a " fifth trunk line ' ' to rank with Pennsylvania , B. &; O ) . , New York Central and C. &; O. roads . The Commission shook its head again . To the open dismay of Mr. Loree , the Pennsylvania was allowed to buy up the Lehigh and the Wabash . But it was 1928. stocks had gone up , and Mr. Loree had $20,000,000 profit . There was plenty of cash in Delaware &; Hudson when Depression hit . <P> Thereupon , at the bottom of the market , Mr. Loree used some of the cash to buy a clear 10% of New York Central stock . It was easily the largest New York Central holding . Railroad men spoke of the new Leonor Loree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . New York Central stock was worth half what he paid for it , and Mr. Loree was weary of the game .
