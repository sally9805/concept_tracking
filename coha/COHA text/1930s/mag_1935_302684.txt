For 18 months the trustees of the University of Rochester have been dangling a rich prize before the eyes of U. S. educators . In a search for a successor to President Rush Rhees they examined the qualifications of no less than 101 candidates . Last week they voted to drape the presidential mantle over the husky shoulders of Alan Chester Valentine , 33-year-old Master of Yale 's Pierson College . <P> The University of Rochester had the tremendous luck to be located in the city of Rochester , N. Y. , home of George Eastman and Kodaks . The generous Kodak-maker showered Rochester with gifts of $35,500,000 during his lifetime , $20,000,000 more at his death in 1932 . Rochester built a School of Music , a School of Medicine &; Dentistry , a whole new campus for its College of Arts &; Sciences , and still has an endowment of $54,000,000 , fifth largest in the land . <P> To become a great university , many alumni feel that Rochester needs a great man with a great idea . For such a man and such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They saw a pleasant , stocky young man with dark hair &; blue eyes , a fondness for rough sports , no doctor 's degree , and a career of only seven years as an educator . At Swarthmore he had won the esteem of President Frank Aydelotte by playing good football , making Phi Beta Kappa , winning a Rhodes Scholarship . In 1928 he was called back to Swarthmore as an assistant professor of English . In 1932 Yale 's President James Rowland Angell persuaded him to go to New Haven . Within a year President Angell had made him chairman of the Board of Admissions , full professor , Master of Pierson College . Last week Rochester guessed that Messrs . Angell and Aydelotte had had much to do with the selection of their mutual protege to be , like them , a college president .
