txt It now appears that Eve 's " apple , " which started the world 's first family trouble , was a peach . Such was the theory given today by Lloyd C. Stark , nurseryman of Louisiana , Mo . A small inedible peach which grows wild at elevations of MOO feet In Tibet and China is the daddy of all modern peaches , Stark said . The mod. ern fruit was developed and carried through commerce Into Chinese , Re . man , Greek , and Persian civilizations . " In more ancient days , " Stark added , " the Chinese believed eating a certain kind of peach would bring im ? mortality and preserve the body from corruption to the end of the world . The peach tree was the ' tree of know ? edge ' to the Chinese . It may have been that the ' apple , ' eaten by Eve in the Garden of Eden after all was the Persian apple , or , as it is known today , a peach . "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
