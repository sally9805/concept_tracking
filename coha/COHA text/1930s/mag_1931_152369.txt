In the 16th and 17th Centuries great preachers printed their sermons , which little preachers later read to their congregations . Thus were high thoughts diffused among rustic minds . Last week in Texas , a region hospitable to pulpit novelties , * was initiated a modernized version of such preserved preaching . Scene was the Woodland Heights Presbyterian Church , a small Houston congregation which important churchmen lack time to visit in person . To that little church the Division of Visual Aids of the Presbyterian Board of Christian Education sent talking picture equipment . The machines reproduced the gestures and words of Dr. William Chalmers Covert , general secretary of the Presbyterian Board of Christian Education , and of Dr. William Ralph Hall , director of the Department of Home &; Church . When hymn-time came the machine projected the words on the screen , played the music . <P> *E. g. , the Rev. John Franklyn ( " Killer Frank " ) Norris 's radio station KSAT at Fort Worth .               @ @ @ @ @ @
