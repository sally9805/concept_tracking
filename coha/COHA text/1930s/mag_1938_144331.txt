When an industry wants to put its best foot forward , it is likely to hire a man with a knack for public relations . This man the newspapers will refer to as TSAR . Prime examples : the cinema industry 's Hays , baseball 's Landis . <P> A few months ago Frank McNinch of the Federal Communications Commission suggested that he might soon start to investigate radio . Last week , as embarrassingly intimate questionnaires on financial matters began to arrive at every radio station in the land , the National Association of Broadcasters picked a man named Mark Foster Ethridge as president . But despite the inevitable newspaper headlines , no Tsar is Mark Ethridge . He is general manager of the Bingham papers in Louisville-the Courier-Journal and the Times-and he will spend more time in Louisville than he will in Washington . He took pains to make it clear last week that the N. A. B. will continue to be a trade association and nothing else . The radio industry is afflicted with various forms of static-incredibly complicated radio unions are fermenting , musicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are at odds about patents-but Mr. Ethridge 's chief duty will be using his charming Southern accent to reason Mr. McNinch away from some of his notions . Reports that he was going to censor all radio material to prevent such celebrated slips as the affair Mae West , he implied , were ridiculous . He will take no salary . When Radio really finds a Tsar , he will gracefully step aside .
