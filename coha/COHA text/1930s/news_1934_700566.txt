txt With Administration leaders in Congress making some progress to head off the Frazier-Lemke farm mortgage bill . two other moves threatening the Roosevelt program came forward to bother them . A petition to force a vote on the bill calling for federal reimbursement of depositors in closed banks made astounding headway despite the fact that President Roosevelt is known to be absolutely opposed to the measure . The Senate silver bloc perfected plans to amend the ' Dies bill to include a silver purchase plan . The Frazier-Lemke bill , which at one time had 136 signatures , or only nine less than the 145 necessary to force a House vote , weakened under attack of House leaders . They succeeded in getting withdrawals sufficient to bring the number of signers down to 131 . Supporters of the bill and the silver bill confidently claim enough votes in both House and Senate to pass the measures They are not even prepared to admit that they lack the strength necessary to pass the two bills over a possible veto . Anxious For Roosevelt Return The prospects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is still barely possible that the measure might gel through the House , but so far as the Senate is concerned it might meet about the same fate as that apparently scheduled for the soldier bonus . Apparently powerless to head off the movement for any of the mcas-zrcs. ibistrat ? cn leaders in House and Senate were looking with some anxiety for the return of President Roosevelt on Friday . When the President arrives in Washington he will be told by leaders in Congress that the situation calls for concentration behind absolutely essential measures to insure an early adjournment of Congress . These leaders believe that adjournment by May 1.5-fis. eentia1 and some of thein'are now aiscus:sing tfYe possibility of quitting by April 29 . The longer Congress remains here , the greater will be the danger of passage of measures which the Administration opposes , in the opinion of leading Democratic and Republican members . At the same time the liberals in the Administration are prepared to insist on a continuation of the present session'to enact further reform legislation which they believe is essential to round out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation , a communications bill and extensive amendment to the AAA Act are some of the measures which the liberals have in mind . What Leaders Think Could Be Accomplished Opposing this , the Congressional leaders believe that the legislative program should be curtailed to include the appropriation bills , a simplified stock market regulation bill , the tax bill and the emergency tariff bill . By centering on these they believe Congress could be wound up within a few weeks and that opportunity to bring in other measures , such as those now threatening , would be shut out . The measure would provide machinery for paying off in full the deposits in all closed or restricted member banks of the Federal Reserve system , requiring roughly $1,800 , - 000,000 . However , there is a strong movement on foot to amend the bill to include closed state banks as well , which would bring the total above $4,000,000,000 . The Frazier-Lemke bill would liquidate and refinance all farm mortgages throughout the United States by issuance of bonds . In addition , the Federal Farm Loan Board would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indebtedness . The measure provides that bonds so issued may be sold at par to any individual or corporation or to any state or national agency . It is declared to be the duty of the Federal Reserve banks to invest their available surplus and net profits in the bonds . In the event the farm loan bonds " are not readily purchased " the remainder , the bill provides , shall be presented to the Federal Reserve Board . The Reserve Board is directed to issue Reserve note currency in amounts equal to the total par value of the bonds in its hands . Fiscal and Monetary Programs Threatened A limiting section is included in the bill providing that whenever the amount of money " actually in circulation " in the United States exceeds $75 per capita , the Treasurer of the United States , with the approval of the Federal Reserve and the President . may retire the Federal Reserve notes in amount equal to the principal paid on farm loan bonds , for which notes were issued , but at a rate not to exceed 2% annually of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans calls for the nationalization of domestic monetary silver , excepting that in minor coins , and the purchase of silver in world markets until the commodity price index reaches the 1926 level or until the standard silver dollar has a purchasing power equal to the gold dollar .

The and Frazier-Lemke bills would wreck the Administration 's fiscal program , which rolls for a tapering of government expenditures and government borrowing , with an early balancing of the federal budget . In the opinion of authorities here , the bill might lead to currency inflation through the Federal Reserve . The Frazier-I.omke bill obviously contemplates that . The Thomas silver proposal would upset the Administration 's monetary program and probably make the government borrowing to finance the recovery program very difficult .
