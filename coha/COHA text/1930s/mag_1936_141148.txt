Although it rolled off Soviet Government presses nearly a month ago , the new Russian Constitution was still last week being kept the darkest of Bolshevik secrets . Curiosity is a major Russian trait and inquisitive tension throughout the Soviet Union was becoming terrific . With everyone fairly panting for news a few leaks oozed at last from the Commissariat of Justice . Comrade Andrei Philipov , Public Prosecutor of Moscow District , emitted the most startling hint . In 1930 was celebrated with great Bolshevik fanfare throughout Russia " The Decennial Anniversary of the Legalization of Abortion in the Soviet Union " - this always having been described by Communists as a boon conferred by the late great Nikolai Lenin . In Russia last week it was like the exploding of a bombshell when Prosecutor Philipov strongly intimated that under the new Bolshevik legal structure there will be " Prohibition of Abortion . " Higher in the Communist hierarchy than Moscow Prosecutor . Philipov is the Public Prosecutor for the whole Soviet Union , smart Comrade Andrei Januari Yishinsky , who recently obtained a sentence condemning to death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ) . Last week the Chief Prosecutor declared in Moscow that the new Constitution will seek to correct " the basic defect of the criminal code . " <P> Even a few weeks ago it would have been a shooting offense for any Russian to say openly that his country 's Communist criminal code had basic defects . These are , declared Comrade Vishinsky , the present code 's " unwieldiness , its lack of clarity and its insufficiency of attention to defense of the rights and interests of individual working people . " <P> Thus last week , 19 years after the Russian working people hopefully staged their Revolution , they were promised for adoption , at a date not yet announced , a new Constitution to defend their personal rights and interests . According to All Union Chief Prosecutor Vishinsky a special object of the new Constitution will be " to provide maximum precautions against unwarranted indictments and unjust convictions " and to protect the individual " even against wrongful prosecution by the State .
