The Bulgarian budget is small , compared to those of other states , but the national income is also small , so that a Bulgarian genes ally has less left for himself after paying his obligations to the state than most other European peoples . Each peasant here pays approximately $7 annually to the state and his average income is not much more than $30 . The average family income is a little over $13 a month , and in many villages it is less than 510 . The chief item of expenditures , in many village families , is taxes . This is the principal thing for which they need cash .
