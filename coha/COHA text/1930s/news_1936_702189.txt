txt Political prophets abound in the land and flatly contradict each other . No one of them knows exactly what is going to happen on Nov. 3 . But one prediction most of them would agree to in common . It is that this Presidential election is to be less one-sided than that of 1932 . If there can be any political certainty in the confused situation , it is that LANDON will carry more States than HoovER did four years ago . It might be possible to come to this conclusion solely from the attitude and public utterances of Chairman FARLEY during the past seven or eight months . Before the national conventions were held , he was utterly contemptuous of the Republican party . It had no outlook whatever ; it could not agree upon a platform ; it had no respectable candidate in sight ; its meeting at Cleveland would be a scene of fierce quarrels and a probable split . After all this forecast had been falsified by the event , Mr. FARLEY altered his tone . He had at first spoken of Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely a lawyer who had made money in oil . Somebody must have rapped him over the knuckles for this , since he presently remarked apologetically that LANDON was a fine man and that Kansas was a grand State . Thus the Democratic chairman signified that he was not going to keep on making the blunder of despising his opponent . He now occasionally betrays signs of nervous irritation as when , two days ago , he protested angrily that Governor LEHMAN was being " betrayed " by managers of his own party in Westchester and the Bronx . It is true that Mr. FARLEY now and then repeats his prophecy that the Democratic victory this year is going to be even more sweeping than in 1932 . But nobody believes this , and it is doubtful if he does himself . If the November election reveals a more nearly equal division of party strength , this will not be a cause for regret . A smaller popular majority , together with a less imposing number of electoral votes , would do President ROOSEVELT no harm . It might even help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within more conservative lines , as he must now naturally be inclined to do . If there is to be a healing policy of doing nothing to interfere with recovery and of establishing in new security and strength that " private enterprise " upon which the President stakes everything in his Chicago speech , it can best be had from a House of Representatives less preponderantly Democratic , and from a party facing a stronger opposition in the country . These are general principles having to do with government by party to which sensible men would assent in ordinary times . At a period of heated partisan conflict they are apt to be ignored or denied . But after the election , if it should prove to have been more closely fought than many thought possible a year ago , the traditional ideals will return . Americans will think it , best not to give unlimited power to any one party , and to have an Administration that can not hope to succeed by applying its " fine brute majority " ? in the words of WALTER BAGEHOT ?
