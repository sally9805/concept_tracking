txt Convincing pi oof that the way back Dom dictatoisimi to democracy is not so hat d as has often been alleged was afforded by Estonia on Jan 1 when a new Constitution , the third since 1920 came into force abolishing the Fascist , Constitution , which was adopted four gyeais ago After apparentlw being fit mly wedded to democracy from the time of its foundation in 1918 , toe Estonian Republic in 1933 suddenly went Fasmst , did away with the original 1920 Constitution and adopted a new one by which an elected President was to have almost completely dictatorial ' powers including the tight of legislating and Imposing taxation by decree . This new Constitution came Into force on Jan 24 , 1934 , and in accordance with its provisions . the Acting President , Mr. Konstantm Pats , was charged with the duty of twanging for the election of a Leader-President , Mr. Pats , however , had other ideas Convinced that Fascism was out of place III Estonia , he declared man tial law tin oughout the country and then with the help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquidated " the Fascist ex-servicemen 's patty known as Vaps , under whose auspices the move away from &room; acy had been engineered . New Constitution Soon a Rem rds. he ' announced that it was impassible to put the new Constitution into force In its entirety and that he intended to call a new Assembly to draw up a new Constitution This body duly met in February , 1937  --  a little more than a year after an attempted coup d'etat by the Vaps leaders had been frustrated It completed its labors in August , 1937. and on Jan. 1 , Estonia avid general iejoicings , once more became a denim acy . In extenuation of Estonia 's temporary lapse , IL must be admitted that the first democratic Constitution , adopted In the heydey of idealistic liberalism which followed the couny 's liberation from Russian rule , had not functioned too well . Com- plaints were widespread that there were too many members of Pas hament , too many pal ties and too much money spent on the machine y of government . It was perhaps natural that Estonians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have been inexpei ienceci in self-government . Hence the tempoiary success which attended the erica is of the ex-servicemen to pei - suede the nation to vote away its democratic Constitution in October , 1933 . The 1937 Constitution does away with authoritarian rule by declaring in its first article that " Estonia is a sovereign and independent Republic in which the supreme authority in the State resides in the people " then goes on to establish that all citizens are equal before the law , that the domicile is inviolable , that liberty of conscience and religious worship is assuied , subject only to the interests of national security , morals and the reputation of citizens . Furthermore the secrecy of postal , telegraphic and telephonic communication is guaranteed , as is also the right of citizens to form cultural , political , professional and industrial associations . There is to be no censorship , and rights of property are safeguarded . Estonia believes it is possible to live next to Russia without adopting a repressive system to prevent the spread of Bolshevik ideas .

President Chooses Cabinet The President chooses his Cabinet where he likes  --  either from members of the National Assembly or from others . They hold office at his pleasure except that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the National Assembly they must either be dismissed or there must be an appeal to the Upper House . As an alternative the President may dissolve the Lower House . By an arrangement somewhat similar to that In the United States , no law is valid until it has been promulgated by the President who has the right to return any law to the National Assembly for reconsideration at any time within 30 days after it Is first submitted to him for signature . A throe-fifths majority of the Lower House or an absolute majority of the two Houses sitting together is necessary to pass a law over the President 's veto . The Lower House ( or Chamber of Deputies ) of the National Assembly consists of 80 members . Ordinary sessions must be held twice a year , beginning on the second Tuesdays of January and October , respectively . The October session is primarily to deal with the budget .

An unusual feature of the Constitution in a " tribunal of Honor " to deal with " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Insofar as the National Assembly is concerned the Tribunal is free to establish its own rules and competence . When an honor dispute involves a non-member , however , the procedure is to be regulated by a special law . Under he new Constitution , an Estonian citizen becomes eligible to vote when he reaches the age of 22 . He may net be elected to the Chamber of Deputies until he is 25 or to the National Council until he Is 40 . The President must be at least 45 .
