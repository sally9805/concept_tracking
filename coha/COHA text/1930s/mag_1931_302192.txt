Only a thin plaster partition in a Danville , Va . hotel one day last week separated the persons of William Green , president of the American Federation of Labor , and Harrison Robertson Fitzgerald , president of Riverside &; Dan River Mills Co . Their industrial principles , however , remained poles apart . What tied them together in the week 's news were their conflicting interests in the A. F. of L. 's strike , biggest of the Depression , in Mr. Fitzgerald 's Danville mills , largest and long the most peaceful of Southern textile plants . President Green conferred with strike leaders in a private parlor of the hotel while through the wall from the next room came the muffled voice of President Fitzgerald ad dressing a Rotary luncheon . <P> Mr. Green had journeyed to Danville to propose a partial surrender . Declaring that " the Danville strike is but an incident in the campaign to unionize the Southern cotton mills , " he set 3,000 strikers &; friends to lusty cheering by suggesting that they return to work in the mills and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went so far as to suggest that either Rear Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd or Virginia 's onetime Governor Harry Flood Byrd act as public arbitrator . His prime stipulation for peace : the workers ' right to remain mem bers of the A. F. of L. 's textile union . <P> Upon that stipulation , however , was seen the ultimate wreck of his peace offer , because Unionism had become the core of the Danville fight . <P> The Riverside &; Dan River Mills strad dle the Dan River , are connected by covered concrete bridges . Normally the personnel numbers 4,500 operatives . President Fitzgerald , whose father was one of the company 's founders , started at 17 to work in the plant . When he became its head he organized the mills into a thoroughgoing industrial " republic " with himself as president . He built a $250,000 Y. M. C. A. for his workers , supplied them with neat houses , free electricity . Because he believes that his deafness was caused by poor medical attention when he was a boy , he provided plant doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of as a " workers ' congress . " There was a lower house of representatives of employes and a senate made up of representatives of the foremen , overseers , second hands . Plant problems were handled in parliamentary fashion . In spite of the hard times which struck the textile business three years ago , the Fitzgerald mills maintained a wage level averaging 10% higher than any other Southern plant . <P> But last February a 10% " economy reduction " in wages was ordered . The workers went to Labor President Green for aid . The A. F. of L. , which has yet to get a firm foothold in the South , viewed Mr. Fitzgerald 's " workers ' congress " as merely one more example of the hated " company union . " Mr. Green eagerly sent organizers to Danville , signed up most of the Fitz gerald employes . <P> When the mills began dismissing union ringleaders , a strike was called Sept. 29 . So well did both sides behave themselves that not until last month did the struggle begin to attract much outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
