THIS IS MY OWN , MY NATIVE LAND A STORY BY BENEDICT THIELEN S LEEPING , she still heard in her mind the music at the dance to which she had been with Nat the night before . The music and the rhythm of the dancing feet sounded in her sleep above the regular unnoticed rhythm of the nearby sea . But gradually something else crept in that was music too , but different from the music of the night before . This was a thin high music , softly played but , at the same time , shrill , liquid , and piping , like a rising and falling , unhurried bird-note . Shc woke up . The thin high piping came from downstairs , from the kitchen . She opened her eyes , staring up at the ceiling . The clear notes came up from the floor , steady , rippling , rising and falling , softly played in the kitchen . She turned and glanced over at the watch which Nat had given her . It was not yet six o'clock , and already Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , softly , thinking he would wake no one , waking everyone . Looking up at the ceiling , she knew how he looked sitting by the stove , his head bent a little backward , his eyes looking out the window at the gray early mist of the New England Sunday morning , his pursed lips which gave him that smiling-serious expression that was so silly blowing into the little flute . She tried to bury her head deeper in the pillow , but it was no use . The liquid flute-notes burrowed through the pillow and into her ear , reminding her thatthis was the day of the Feast of the Holy Ghost . They had this feast because long ago , back there in the Azores , there was a famine and the princess who ruled said she would sell her silver crown to buy food for the people who were starving . But it was n't necessary for her to sell her crown because two ships loaded with grain were wrecked on the shore and there was food for everybody . It was a miracle , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feast to celebrate it , and that was why Uncle Manuel had to wake her up so early on this Sunday morning , practicing his flute which he would play later on in the day , along with men beating drums , at the head of the procession . And long ago , leaving the church , the organ music still ringing in your ears , the light on the raised Host still bright in your eyes , feeling good , although you did n't know why , you stood by the litter beside the beautiful silver crown , just like the one the princess had worn . Dressed in white , with the seven other little girls ( you , Rose Oliver  --  proud now because your name sounded more American than it used to when it was Olivera  --  with Marguerite Sylvia , Helen Sanchos , and the others ) , you held on tightly to the litter on which rested the shining crown . Ahead of you the musicians , Uncle Manuel among them , played runs of impatient notes on their flutes or gave short muffled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form . Then , when every-thing was ready , there was a brief silence , someone dropped his raised hand , and the shrill flutes squealed in the hot summer air , the drums beat , and the procession moved slowly down the street to Azores Hall . You , dressed in white , carefully holding the silver crown , while behind you were Charlie , Antone , Frank , and the other boys , carrying the huge cake with the icing that glittered in the sun and the decorations of red and green and blue frosting and the pink roses made of sugar , and the enormous loaf of bread and the high-piled fruits and flowers , winding slowly through the quiet Sunday street among the elm trees and the neat white New England houses , seeing the other people standing by the curbs staring at you , under the hot summer sky , behind the trailing ribbons of clear thin sound from the flutes and the rhythmic beat of the drums . But that was all long ago , and now it seemed different , somehow , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You felt a little foolish as you passed the other people , standing there by the curbs and staring at you as though you were crazy , carrying a silver crown through the streets , as though you were back in Europe somewhere where they did things Iike that and not here , in America , as though you yourself were n't really just as much an American as they were but some kind of outlandish foreigner . As they passed the Methodist church the service had just ended and the people were coming out . Groups were gathered on the sidewalk . They turned their heads as the procession passed , watching it , their faces looking either cold or else faintly amused . She saw Nat and his father and mother standing together and she smiled at them as she went past . Nat did n't smile back but that was probably because there were so many people in the crowd that he did n't see her . In a large crowd Iike that it was often hard to make out separate faces . The whole thing just looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her side , said something , and she turned toward him . " What did you say ? " He motioned with his head toward a group of men leaning back against the front of the drugstore . One of the men was looking at the procession and laughing . " That Roy Norris , " her father said . " Oh , him , " she said . There probably was nothing in that story about . Roy Norris , even though her father and Uncle Manuel always insisted it was true and would scowl and get red in the face whenever they saw him . They said that when they first came to this town and started their fishing Roy Norris had tried to drive them out of business by cutting their lobster pots adrift and that he had been the one who had smashed a hole in the side of the tank where they kept the eels that were to go to New York for the Italian Christmas trade and that over a thousand of them were killed . But that was all long ago and it probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Roy was a cousin or something of Nat 's , and they were n't the sort of people who did things like that . When they got to the hall the crown was put in a shrine at the far end and everybody dropped a coin into the box that stood next to it . After that the auction began . They sold all sorts of things , and often people paid as much as a dollar for a loaf of bread , because all the money that they collected went to charity . It was funny seeing people try to outbid one another on something like a loaf of bread or an old pair of shoes , and then often giving it back to be bid for again . Now too in the hall there was a warm smell of food coming from the kitchen at the other end , and the sound of plates and knives and forks being set on the bare wooden tables and the occasional pop of a bottle of red wine being opened and , closer at hand , a smell of wine from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while and went out and then came back , looking innocent , while their friends tried to catch their eyes and wink at them , and as the time went by there was louder talk and more laughter . From across the room Helen Sanchos waved at her and then came over to where she was sitting . " Well , so you made it after all , " she said . " I did n't think you would after last night . " " How about yourself ? " Rose said laughing . " You were still there when we left . " Helen shook her head . " I 'm still only half awake . " " Me too . And Uncle Manuel started practicing his flute right under my room before it was even daylight . " " My God , Rose , nol " She looked around the room . " It all seems sort of crazy , does n't it , when you stop to think of it ? " " Yes . Still , they get a kick out of it , so .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of carting that old crown around ? " They both laughed , then Helen said , " Where 's Nat ? " " Nat ? I do n't know . Why ? " " Oh , I just thought he might come around for dinner . Remember , you told him he could come around , last night ? " " Oh . . . oh , yes . Well , he might be around . I do n't know . We did n't say anything definite . " Helen looked toward the door , frowning , then her face lighted up and she waved her hand . The man smiled and came toward them , making his way slowly through the crowd . He had a dark sunburned face and good teeth . " I did n't know Frank was the . . . the latest , " said Rose . " Latest ! Why , we 're engaged , did n't you know ? " " Goodness , engaged ! Why , I had no idea , Helen . " She leaned forward and embraced her . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , " Rose here did n't even know we were engaged . Can you beat it ? " " What 's the matter with you , Rose , do n't you ever read the papers ? " said Frank . Helen sniffed the air and looked at Frank . Frank grinned and said , " Say , Nat was feeling pretty high last night , was n't he ? " " Oh , I do n't know , " Rose said . " I guess we all felt pretty good . " " A little too good as far as I 'm concerned , " Frank said . " That 's why I thought a little of this dago red would kind of hit the spot . " " Say , " Helen said , " we 'd better find a place if we 're going to get something to eat . How about sitting with us , Rose ? " Rose glanced toward the door . " Do you think Nat 'll be here ? " Helen asked . " Because if you 'd rather wait , why . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't imagine he will . He said he 'd probably have to have dinner home with his family . Anyway , I 've got a date with him to-night . " They found places together at the long table and sat down . Frank uncorked the bottle of red wine standing in front of them and poured them each a glass . He took a long drink of his , then said , " Boy , that 's not had , is it now ? " " I like wine , " Helen said as she put down her glass . " It makes you feel good but you still know what you 're doing . " " Have some rye , " Frank said , and they all laughed . " That 's true though , " Rose said . " I like it much better too . " They were silent for a few moments , then Frank said , " How 's the job , Rose ? You still like it ? " " Oh , yes , it 's all right . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boss next , like they do in the movies , " he said with a laugh . " Do n't be silly , " Rose said . Helen glanced at him sharply . He cleared his throat , then said , " Well , I see where you 've started handling a line of oil burners and that new gas in tanks , besides the coal and ice , I mean . " " Oh , yes , that was Nat 's idea . " THIS IS MY OWN , Frank shook his head and said , " Nat 's a smart guy all right . " " Remember the fights you used to have with him ? " Helen said . " Boy , do I ! We get along all right now though . But it used to get me so damn sore when he 'd call me a Portugee I was just about ready to kill him . " " Did Nat use to do that ? " Rose asked . " Sure , but then all the kids did . You remember how it was . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they get over that after a while , " Helen said . " Yes , sure of course , " Frank said . They were all silent for a second or two , looking straight ahead of them . Then Helen said , " But I think it 's a shame they wo n't allow us to have dancing here just because it 's Sunday . " " Yes , " Rose said , " you 'd think when it 's for charity like this that . . . " " Oh , well , that 's the way they are , " Frank said . " Who do you mean , ' they ' ? " Helen said . Frank hesitated , looking confused , then he said , " Why . . . why I mean the people . You know , people in the town . " " Pop said back home . . you know , back there where they came from , they always had dancing on Sundays , " Rose said . " Uncle Manuel used to play the flute even when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's still at it . " Frank turned partly round and looked toward the other end of the room where the musicians were sitting at a table by themselves . " He 's a great old guy , is n't he ? " " Yes , " Rose said , " but when he starts practicing just about at dawn and right under where I 'm sleeping , why . . " They all laughed . Frank took another drink of wine and said , " I do n't know . It must be funny , over there . Different , sort of . . . . " Long ago , on this clay , when they gave you the wine they filled the glass up with water and then added just a little wine to color it . Now the wine was pure in your glass . But the taste was the same , and when the wine went down your throat and then after you had swallowed it and opened your mouth and breathed , there was the same sensation of taste , the same red musty grape taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way it was seasoned , the garlic and the fennel and the sweet basil , was also the same , and the smell of the muslin of the white dresses of the girls that carried the silver crown in the procession , and the thin squeal of the flutes , and the way the sun came in the window on the other side of the hall as the afternoon wore on , dusty , slanting yellow , and the hot midsummer sky outside , and the feeling that the whole town was silent , in a cold Sunday silence , while here there was noise and gayety and animation . Here you were in a vivid core of noise and music and warm wine-smell , shut off from the cold disapproving silence of the surrounding Sunday town . The thick-crusted Portuguese bread was good and the spilled red spots of wine shone like rubies smeared over the wooden table tops . This was still the same , and the sound of loud laughter was the same , and the sun shining on the silver crown was the same , and although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking it so seriously , even feeling that there was something a little silly and foreign and old-fashioned about it , still there was something pleasant about the sensation which all this gave you that there were things in life that did n't change , that were certain and positive , and that made you feel that you knew just where you stood , with warm wine reassuring you , and the thin clear music of flutes . They drove slowly along in the warm darkness , going toward the open country . " I certainly would 've come if I could , Rose , " Nat said . " But they always want me to stay there and have Sunday dinner with them . You know how the old man is . " " Oh , that 's an right , " she said . " I just mean it was really quite a lot of fun . " He said nothing for a few seconds , then he suddenly laughed . " What 's the joke ? " she said , glancing at him . " Nothing . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing that gang walking along toting that tin crown along with them and . . . " " It 's not tin , " she said . " Not tin ? " He raised his voice . " You do n't mean to tell me you really think it 's silver , do you ? " She nodded her head without answering . " Not tin ? " he repeated , and laughed again . " Say , Rosie , you must be sort of simple , you know it ? " " I know it 's silver though , " she said . " How do you know ? " " Because I know it , that 's all . We all . . . I mean everybody knows it . " He let out a long whistle . " You 're not kidding me ? Honest ? But good-night ! It 's worth something then . " " Of course it 's worth something , " she said , and saying that gave her a sudden surprising feeling of pride . " What do you think ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money in a thing like that . Why .. . why , it 's dumb . " " Oh , I do n't know . " " You do n't ? Well , I do . . . . Anyway , what 's the point of the whole thing ? Huh ? " " - Well , this princess said she 'd sell her crown to buy food for . . . " He gave a click of impatience with his tongue . " Yes , yes , I heard all that . So what ? What of it ? " " Well , " she said slowly , not quite sure herself what she was going to say or why , in the first place , she was saying anything , why she was n't simply agreeing with him , " well , it 's the . . . the idea of the thing . It 's . . . " " What idea ? What do you mean ? " " Well it 's sort of a pretty idea . If " He raised one hand from the wheel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time . " A pretty idea , no less ! That 's a good one . Why , if the money that 's tied up in that thing could . . . " " All right , Nat , " she said . " Let 's drop it , shall we ? " He looked at her curiously . " Well , there 's nothing to get sore about , for Heaven 's sake . " She did not answer , and for a time they were both silent , driving along , going faster now . Presently he said , " Well , what else did you do all day besides parade around and eat ? Did you dance , or what ? " " No , " she said , " we did n't dance . We had music but we could n't dance . " " No ? Why not ? " " You know perfectly well they wo n't let us dance on Sunday . " " Who do you mean , ' they ' ? " " Why , you . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean they . . . you know , the people in the town . I mean it 's not allowed . " " Oh , yes . That 's true . Of course . " Presently he said , " Who was there ? Did you see anybody you knew ? " " Oh , yes , I knew lots of people there . I had dinner with Helen Sanchos and Frank , Frank Nunes . They 're engaged . " " Oh , that so ? " He gave a short laugh . " Boy , the scraps Frank and I used to have ! " " Yes . He said you used to . . . " She stopped , looking straight ahead of her at the road . " What ? " " I mean he said you used to fight a lot , " she said . " Yes . Gee , I 'll never forget once he came round , he had a whole bucketful of fish and just as he was coming into the kitchen he slipped and all the fish went all over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so sore the next time he saw me in the street he tried to beat me up . He did n't though . " " No ? " " No . Anyway it was nothing to get so sore about . Lots of people slip on those steps the fit st time . You know how it sort of goes down a step into the kitchen ? " She shook her head . " I 've never been in your house . " " Oh . " He cleared his throat . " Well , it sort of goes down . You know the way it is in those old houses . " For some time they did n't say anything , driving rapidly along in the darkness . Then he said : " Still I should think Helen could have found something .. I mean somebody better than Frank to marry . She 's a real pretty girl . " " Why , do n't you think Frank 's nice ? " " Nice ? Oh , sure , Frank 's all right . I 've got nothing against Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all . " " How do you mean ? " " Well , good-night ! What is he , when you come down to it ? He 's still just a ... I mean , there is n't much money in fishing after all , is there ? Now if she ... " " No , " she said , " I guess there is n't . " " Not that I mind him being a fisherman , " he said quickly . " That 's not it at all . Why , I 've got some relatives round here myself that are just fishermen only . . . " " You mean like Roy Norris ? " " Yes , Roy Norris . He 's sort of a cousin of mine , or something . " He laughed . " Roy 's quite a character . " " Yes ? How ? " " Weil , I mean he 's a great joker . You know , practical jokes  --  always up to something . But if he does n't like somebody Roy can be pretty mean too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too bad . But we always got along all right though . " They turned off the main road and a few hundred yards farther on he stopped the car and turned out the lights . He took a flask out of the pocket in the door , uncorked it , and handed it to her . She shook her head . " I do n't think I want any , Nat , thanks . " He leaned a little forward , looking at her , his eyebrows raised . " No ? What 's the idea ? This is the same we had last night . " " I do n't know . I just do n't feel like any , I guess . " " Temperamental , eh ? " He took a drink from the flask . " Sure you wo n't change your mind ? " " No , thanks . " She leaned forward to look at her watch . " Anyway , it 's getting late , Nat . We 'd better be getting back . " He turned his head quickly toward her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put his arm round her shoulder . " Come on , Rose , let 's not fight . Life is too short . " She drew away from him , half smiling . " I 'm not fighting , Nat . Only I really think I 'd better be getting back . Anyway , I . . . I do n't feel so good . I 've got sort of a headache . " " Weil , that 's certainly too bad ! " He uncorked the bottle with a jerk and took another drink . She said nothing , looking straight ahead of her at the darkness . " I suppose now you 're sore at something , " he said . " I suppose I said something . What did I say , for Heaven 's sake ? " " Nothing , " she said . " You did n't say anything . Nat . " He looked at her a few seconds longer , then started the engine and jammed his foot down hard on the accelerator , starting with a jerk . They drove home in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father and Uncle Manuel were sitting by the table in the kitchen with a bottle of wine between them . They were talking Portuguese together but when she came in they stopped and spoke to her in English . She stood there for a short while , leaning against the door between the kitchen and the living room , then went over and turned on the radio . She took off her hat and coat and threw them on a chair and stood in front of the radio , listening to the jazz that came out of it . Several of the pieces were things that they had played last night at the dance . With a radio you could be sure of always hearing the latest music . From the kitchen , above the radio , she could hear her father and Uncle Manuel talking Portuguese , and from time to time there was the sound of their laughter . She found herself listening more to them than to the music that came out of the radio , hearing the half-familiar sounds of the Portuguese , understanding parts of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had known Portuguese as well as she did English , but it was rusty now . Still as she listened the words gradually began to sound more familiar and she found that she was understanding practically everything , almost as though the words were English and not those of a foreign tongue . She turned off the radio and went out again to the kitchen . " Well , what 's new , Rosie ? " said Uncle Manuel , as she came in . She smiled and shook her head . " Nothing much .. . Go on and talk like you were . You do n't have to talk English just because I 'm here . " Uncle Ma nuel laughed and said , " O.K. " She sat down in a chair by the side of the stove and watched the two men sitting there , drinking their red wine , talking about places where she had never been and things that she had never seen . There were the green hills rolling down to the windy sea on the islands , far out in the Atlantic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the sound of the sea . ) Vineyards sloped down to the sea , and when the wine was made there was music and dancing . ( Our grapes here are wild and no wine is made from them . There isno dancing on Sunday . ) The grain is ground with windmills and all over the islands the great wings of the windmills are beaten by the sea wind . ( There is still a windmill near here . It is kept up by the Historical Society . ) The houses in Horta , Ponta Delgada , Flores are covered with colored plaster , red , green , yellow , pink , and blue . ( The houses here , in Yarmouth , Chatham , Dennis , are made of weathered gray shingles with neatly painted white trim , like Nat 's father 's house . ) In Ponta Delgada the sidewalks are made of black and white stones , laid in mosaic designs . ( We have concrete sidewalks and the best roads in the world . ) The fishermen put out to sea from the islands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fireside . ( Helen Satichos will wait at home for Frank by the fireside . Frank is a fisherman who does n't make much of a living from the sea . There is more money in coal and ice and it is wise to add a line of oil burners and the new kind of gas that comes in tanks . ) Long ago the princess was going to sell her silver crown , and we carried the crown in a procession through the streets while the people stared at us , and later we were a core of noise and laughter in the cold quiet of the Sunday town . We were strangers , laughing , in the silence of the Sunday town . After a time Uncle Manuel took up his flute and began to play . She went upstairs to her room . In the darkness after she had gone to bed she could still hear the thin clear music coming up through the floor , keeping her awake . The sea too sounded louder than usual .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
