BIOGRAPHY A STORY BY THOMAS BEER M RS . DAMFORT resented her second son , Gordon , most keenly whenever she had to ask him questions . He got toplofty at once as he smacked open the double doors of the long living room and slung his hat into a chair . She knew that he would say , " Well , nowt " in his curiously raw barytone and she cut him short by drawling , " Alt ! So your office located you , sonny ? " Gordon did not like to be called " sonny " of course . But this kept him from saying , " Well , now ! " He said nothing at all . He looked at her . Mrs. Damfort straightened her legs on the couch and smiled . " New dress , mother ? " " Quite , " she said . " Tea party ? " She drawled as slowly as she could , " No . Just this Mr. Newton Wood . It 's why I ' phoned your office , Gordon . You know him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presentable ? " Gordon howled , " Newton Wood ! " Mrs. Damfort crossed her ankles . White satin slushed round her as she shifted on the yellow couch . She said , " Gordon , please do n't begin to tell me that Mr. Wood is a famous writer . I know he 's a celebrity . I merely asked you if he was a presentable person . If he 's anything like the other writers  --  or the writers you bring here , sonny ! ? I must manage to get rid of him before six . Admiral Coles is dropping in for a glass of sherry . And that reminds me . Where should I send your friend Miss Ravel a bill for repairing the bathroom ? I 've no intention of overlooking a broken mirror and a dislocated faucet . Please do n't tell me that the silly creature was drunk . I quite know that . She drank a whole bottle of sherry . Leave me a note of her address . And now let 's get back to Mr. Wood . Is he presentable ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mother . Goes to dances and all that . He 's  --  I think  --  from Baltimore . But what the hell 's he coming here for ? " " To talk to me about Michael Majendie . It seemed , " said Mrs. Damfort , " to be a matter of duty . I happened to notice that he 's writing a biography of Mr. Majendie . I knew Mr. Majendie , and ? " " You knew Michael Majendie ? " " Gordon , you 're twenty-seven years old . Must you howl ? " He picked up Memories of Two Embassies from the Italian table . " I 've never heard you say a word about Majendie , mother ! I ? You 're funny ! Whenever you get reminiscent it 's always about meetin ' King Edward or socialites or ? " " Socialites ! Gordon , what fun does your generation get out of being quite so vulgar ? " " Oh , " he said , " I suppose we are . Yes , we are . Had lunch with Gummy Ravel . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were having coffee . The waiter hated her ! But you are funny , mother . How did you come to know a tough hero like Majendie ? He got killed over a woman out in San Francisco , you know ? Shot in a restaurant . Her hush ? " " I naturally know that , Gordon . I remember what happened in 1905 ? still ! " " But , you 're funny ! You lie round here , looking like Manet 's ' Olympia , ' and never ? " " Like what ? " He spun his aunt 's memoirs on his palm . " It 's a famous nude by Manet , mother . A woman on a couch . You do n't look anything like her , really . I . . . Dad was a big surgeon . You must have known reams of interestin ' people . Gosh , " he said , flopping the book down , " what a bore this stuff of Aunt Selene 's is ! And  --  and I 'm rather sore about it . Dad was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't even mention that he was a surgeon who got her through her peritonitis in ' 20 . Realize she does n't mention you by name in the damn ' book at all ? You 're ' my twin sister ' in the first part , there . She does n't ? " " Candidly , " Mrs. Damfort drawled , " I have n't been able to read the thing , Gordon . Do n't they call them ghost writers ? The experts who write books for people ? Selene should have had one . No , I ca n't read it . " " You 're handsomer than she is , " he said . " I mean that . But where in hell did you bump into Majendie ? He was an anarchist , y ' know . Old Karl Winter was talking about him other night at the Copes ' . Says he was the handsomest dark man he ever saw . Where 'd you meet him ? " " At a dinner party at your uncle Bill 's . Please remember that Bill was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was studyingpainting . I met Michael , " she said , " at a St. Valentine 's Day dinner Bill gave in 1899 . There 's a note on the desk , there . " Her son murmured , " Michael ! " and paced to the desk between the windows . He read the yellow note aloud . " ' Dear Blake , my wife says the peach at my left at your dinner is your sister , Mrs. Damfort . I apologize . I told her about you assaulting that vache in Paris , that time ' . Wow ! Imagine Uncle Bill having a fight with a cop ! " Mrs. Damfort was glad to know what vache meant . Oh , yes , she could get through with it . Yes , yes , yes . And now she knew that Michael Majendie was dark . That had not been plain in the one photograph at the Public Library yesterday . She ordered , " Careful of that , please . It 's the only letter of Michael 's I have left . The others were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gordon said , scowling at her , " You ? you knew this fellow well enough to call him Michael ? " " Certainly . " " Mother , I apologize ! Always thought you were the complete bourgeoise  --  did n't know anybody that was n't correct . " " Really ? " she said . " Run along , please . I 've no intention of discussing Michael 's unhappy married life with Mr. Wood in front of you . You 'd tell Miss Gummy Ravel and Mr. Rex Israel and the Kelly youth all about it . " " Newton Wood 's from Philadelphia , " said Gordon . " Just remembered . His father 's a High Church parson . Yes , he 's presentable , mother . " " So glad . Run along , please . " But she was frightened , now , listening to Gordon as he trotted upstairs . It would have been easier if Newton Wood were not the son of a High Church pastor in Philadelphia . He might know things . She wished that the celebrated person was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked her if her family had " much social position back in the ' 90s . " She was suddenly cold on the yellow couch . She drew out a long slip of print from under the pillow and read , " Mr. Majendie was born in 1869 at Jerusalem , Pa . He was the son of a paperhanger . In 1887 he entered Princeton but was dropped after two months . He worked in the office of a Philadelphia newspaper for some months and got together enough money for a ticket to Paris where he lived precariously for three years , studying painting and supporting himself by illustrations for the comic papers . In 1891 he came to New York , where he worked as an illustrator . Tall , handsome , and cheerful , he became a well-known figure in Bohemian restaurants . He was a Socialist . In 1895 some of his paintings were displayed at the Dietrich gallery on Fifth Avenue and members of a religious organization took objection to a nude study , Girl On Grass , which suggests the influence of Manet . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Majendie met Miss Beatrice Ripley , daughter of General Thomas Ripley , of Columbus , Ohio . They were married without the consent of the bride 's family , on September 17 , 1897 , and lived in Englewood , N. J. until 1903 when Mrs. Majendie left him . She died of pneumonia at Columbus last year . No reason for the separation was given to the press . In January , 1904 , Mr. Majendie went on a trip to Japan with Mr. Karl Winter , the well-known writer . It is said that Mr. Majendie met the heroine of yesterday 's tragedy at Honolulu , on the return trip . Mr. Majendie settled in San Francisco last April . Reports from San Francisco so far indicate that Captain Hilliker was incensed by some letters from Mr. Majendie to his wife , found in a drawer of her desk , and that yesterday 's tragedy . . . " The paper squashed in her hand . She drawled to a shadow , " Yes ? " The butler said , " Mr. Wood , ma'am . " " Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , ma'am . " The world was a frozen globe , spinning under her couch . She could not get up . She would never get through it , never , never . It was worse than knowing that the man in a silver bracelet beside her on the cliff really was King Edward and that she had to speak . Mr. Newton Wood wore a white flower in his morning coat and the coat fitted . His face was square . " This is awfully good of you , Mrs. Damfort . Oh , d' you mind gardenias ? The scent , I mean . " " N-not at all , " she said , tearing the obituary . " Rather like it . " " I 've been at a wedding . Usher . " " The Trowbridge girl 's : " He said , " Yes . Known the happy bridegroom all my life . Kind of third cousin . But your note startled me . Ca n't imagine Majendie having known anybody in the  --  the ranks of conservatism . Saw a gorgeous photograph of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Joel Damfort as Artemis . Tableaux vivants for a charity . " The frozen globe spun faster . Cousin of the Trowbridge girl 's husband ! Mrs. Damfort drawled , " Those tableaux ! Heavens , I 'd forgotten that . Yes , Artemis . Got in such a row about it , too . No stockings . The man who posed us ... Was it Stanford White ? Anyhow , he insisted on no stockings For me . Old Mrs. Vail Abercrombie lectured me so . Had convulsions . Dear old dragon ! " she said . " Do you mind if I lie here ? I 'm beastly tired . Shopping all day . My oldest granddaughter comes out next week . Joel 's wife died . I 've rather had to look after young Frederica . She 's named for me . And I 'm sixty-two . " He smiled . And the world did not spin . Let him look at her , in fresh white satin , with her hair freshly waved . Let him look at her . Let him think that Mrs. Vail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those tableaux . She crossed her ankles . " Would you mind telling me what color your hair was , Mrs. Damfort ? " " Mr. Sargent got it exactly , " she said , and pointed to the rosy picture above the fireplace . " I hope you do n't mind being asked to look at a Sargent ? My son 's literary friends suggest that I should burn it . " He said , " How kind of them ! " and moved off to the hearth . Frederica Damfort looked across his smooth head at the painting . Well , what was wrong with it ? She stiffened to defend it . Her husband had called it " soapsuds " in 1901 . Why should n't Mr. Sargent have made the scarf blow from her shoulders in those nice curves ? It was a lovely picture . Everybody knew it was a Sargent as soon as they saw it . " I call it pretty good , " said Mr. Wood . " We undervalue him a bit , I think . Yes , we undervalue him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So your hair was chestnut ? " Mrs. Damfort drawled , " Sweet of you not to say red . Read that note on the desk , please . I met Michael at a St. Valentine dinner my brother gave in ' 99 . He was William Clandon Blake , the architect . Died in ' 24 . " The lean man stopped midway between the hearth and the yellow couch . She knew that " Michael " had stopped him . Then he walked on to the Spanish desk . She watched him reading . Oh , such luck not to have thrown the thing away when she was going over Bill 's papers with his secretary ! She had remembered , in ' 24 , that Michael Majendie was somebody . She did not know who he was . But people began to talk about him . Somebody gave a show of his paintings , somewhere , last year . " Mr. Majendie ever see that Sargent , Mrs. Damfort ? " " Michael called it soapsuds  --  of course . " " Of course ! But I think he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damfort . I mean  --  calling them a lot of leeches on the plutocracy  --  that sort of thing . Did he ever sketch you ? " " Yes . On my horse in Central Park . " " He 'd have liked that , " said Mr. Wood . " His horse mania ! Where is it ? " " Nowhere . I had the sketch  --  and a lovely sketch he did of my oldest boy , Joel , and all his letters in a box , down at our house on Long Island . They all went up in 1914 . Bad insulation . The whole house went , " she said . " My father 's Civil War diaries , a mass of Dr. Damfort 's papers and the only decent family portrait we owned . " She felt the complete ease of truth . The painting of Grandmamma Blake was nice . " My sister mentions it in her memoirs . You probably have n't read them . She 's Mrs. Austin Ter-hune . " Mr. Newton Wood laughed . " I ... It 's one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two Embassies . I was rather pleasantly  --  surprised that you were willing to see me . This indicates that you did n't read my review . " " I hope it was savage , " said Mrs. Damfort. " / . . . Well , Selene 's a darling , but  --  I think she should have turned over her material to some expert . Too bad . Because really she 's had a most interesting life . No . I did n't read your review , Mr. Wood . I read the book and then did n't want to read the reviews . Well , you have no time to waste and I 've such a dear old bore coming in at six for a drop of sherry . His wife 's one of the dullest women alive . He  --  he comes round here for a breath of air . " She sat up . " I met Michael at this dinner my brother gave . I  --  Bill asked me to look after Michael a bit . It was a big dinner . For some Frenchman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what . It was  --  was rather a tremendous dinner . " " Wealth and fashion , you mean ? " " Precisely , " said Mrs. Damfort . " The Vail Abercrombies and old Lucius Kent . That kind of thing . " " Do tell me , " Mr. Wood asked , " how old Kent got himself taken so seriously up here ? My mother 's always so amused about him . He was a vet 's sun from Germantown , you know . " Mrs. Damfort shuddered . She said , " I 'm not old enough to tell you , young man . But he did get himself taken seriously . One wonders why , now . He was handsome of course . Slim and tall . Had an agreeable voice too . He bored me . " She shrugged her shoulders . " The things we did take seriously ! Well , I met Michael at this dinner . I do want you to understand that Michael may have been a socialist or an anarchist or anything you please , but he had charming manners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly . Too bad Mrs. Charlie Brace is gone ! She liked him . They were n't  --  were n't dear friends . But Maud did like him . " " The banker 's wife , you mean ? " " Yes . Maud met him here and she had him at luncheon two or three times  --  at least . " A notebook had come out . Mr. Wood leaned on the Spanish desk . " That 's what 's so maddening abouthiugiaphy  --  and writers , " he said . " I sit . around with Karl Winter and old Corley and hear that dear old Mike would n't have crossed the street to shake hands with a man who had ten thousand a year . It 's comic ! One-track minds . . . Oh , well ! " " I 'm so sorry my husband 's dead . Michael sometimes  --  not often , though ! ? did talk politics to him . He could have told you things . Dr. Damfort was very liberal . He saw a great deal in some of the socialist theories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming here ? " " A good deal . In the afternoon generally . There  --  there was some ferry or train he always had to catch . He lived in Englewood , you know . " " And had to be home for dinner at six-thirty or get hell , " said Newton Wood . " Yes . " " I did n't want to say that , Mr. Wood . But that was so very much it , you see . Yes , she had to have dinner at six-thirty , " Mrs. Damfort drawled . " Ever meet her ? " Frederica Damfort crumpled her handkerchief and nodded . Yes , that was what he wanted . He wanted to know about Mrs. Michael Majendie , out in Englewood , New Jersey . She said , " Yes . My impressions would not be valuable . I only met her once . She 'd come to town to shop . I met her on Fifth Avenue somewhere . " " Do be frank ! " Mrs. Damfort opened her hand with the handkerchief . " Oh , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got my gloves and  --  and that sort of thing . I  --  I barely met her . Do n't quote me , please . " " Never saw her again ? " " I asked her to lunch . Wrote . Got back an icy little note . Did n't bother again . " Mr. Wood grinned . " Resented you on sight ? " " I did n't say that , young man ! " " It 's what happened to Mrs. Karl Winter . She was awfully handsome . Mrs. Majendie resented her on sight . You 're just filling in a frame , Mrs. Damfort . Happened three or four times . " Mrs. Damfort was sorry for Michael Majendie 's wife . Poor thing , stuck out in Englewood , scared about pretty women in New Yorkl He was handsome . She sighed . Mr. Wood wrote something . A log broke in the fireplace with a little sound , like another sigh . " Funny business , " said Newton Wood . " Because she was so lovely . And she had a certain amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather witty . His sister has those . By guml Of course ! You 're ' my friend in Sixty-Eighth Street ' ! His sister 's forgotten so much . That 's it . In 1902 . Says lie 's been lunching with his friend in Sixty-Eighth Street . He wrote you occasionally ? " The world spun , cold , for a moment . Frederica Damfort said , " I  --  there were about a hundred notes . I could n't have let you print any of them . But it 's such a shame to lose the sketches . He scribbled sketches on them . Little things he thought would amuse me . Such a good one from Honolulu  --  a native diving . Such a shame . Dr. Damfort said , Freddie , you ought to have those photographed . People will want to see them , some day . ' And I did think of it . No use now . " That Iog rolled and sighed again in the fireplace . This silvery room with its black furniture was crushed full of a silence . Newton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him stare . This silence packed the long room . " You could n't have let me print any of them ? " " Very few , " she said . " You mean  --  just what do you mean , Mrs. Damfort ? " " I wish to be perfectly frank . Michael wrote me absolutely nothing he should n't have . He never mentioned his wife  --  directly . Oh , yes ! One of them did begin , ' Life is awful , this morning . ' Something like that . I do n't think it was worse than that . But he took to calling me Olympia , and ? " " Olympia ? " " That Manet picture . The woman on the couch . " " This is one of my dumb days . The Olympia , of course . " He wrote . " Please go on , Mrs. Damfort . " " Oh , that 's all about it . He did write things that would look  --  look odd in print . I had very pretty feet . He used to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kind . I . .. there was a wonderful sketch of a Japanese temple . Shame that 's gone . " The lean man was not writing . Yes , she would be in his book . He said , " Funny to be talking to you . So many photographs of you in society rags back then . " He paused . He was thinking in the silence . " Hope this is n't offensive . Did Majendie write to you after he came back from Japan ? He met this Mrs. Hilliker in Honolulu . She was on an army transport . They were coming from the Philippines . Did he mention her ? " " Not directly  --  no . " " Indirectly ? " Mrs. Damfort Iet there be a pause . " Please smoke . I forgot to tell you to . " " I do n't smoke , thanks . " " Amazing young man ! " " I 'm thirty-six , and discreet . I 've a theory about Mrs. Hilliker . Did Majendie ever mention her to you ? " She let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " That he was n't much in love with her . They let me read her statement to the police , in San Francisco . Only parts of it were printed . " " I do n't think he was much in love , " said Frederica Damfort . " About a month before he was killed . . . Oh , first ! Michael was handsome , you know ? I used to tease him about it . Well , about a month before the  --  the end , he wrote me , ' My fatal beauty has got me into a tiresome mess , out here . ' I  --  it worried me . It was such a funny note , Mr. Wood . Tired and distrait . Dr. Damfort said , ' That 's a woman , Freddie . ' But you have n't any right , have you , to say he  --  he really did n't care about her much ? You 've no proof . " " A biographer has a right to state his theory , Mrs. Damfort . And you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and someone to sit around in a restaurant with . Like the Albin girl in Paris  --  Therese Albin . " " I never heard of her . " Mr Wood said , " Naturally . " Mrs. Damfort was glad she had never known Michael Majendie except at that dinner . She was going to be in a book about him , but it was nice not to have known him . Must have been all wrong . One of the Americans you saw in Paris , sitting with cheap girls in bad restaurants . Oh , she would be in this book thought People would talk to her about it at Southampton . It would not be a book like Selene 's memories of being an ambassadress . People would buy a book by Newton Wood , four or five printings . But thank God , she had never known Majendie ' . Then the room packed with silence again . Mr. Wood put away his notebook . The room was very silent . Newton Wood 's gardenia turned brown at the edges and the scent flowed . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After a little more silence . Yes . In a second . He stirred . " I 'll have to risk being ordered out of your house , Mrs. Damfort . Did Majendie ever make love to you ? " If she could flush. , if she could just flush a little now . And then she was flushing . And it would be right to roll the handkerchief in her hand . So she rolled the handkerchief in her hand . " Mr. Wood , any intelligent woman can avoid being made love to , " she said . " That 's all  --  I am sorry I have n't a good memory of conversation . I ca n't remember phrases well . I 'm not being much help to you , am I ? And , of course , he never discussed painting technically with me . " " I 'm sorry to have been offensive , Mrs. Dam ? " " No . You had a perfect right to ask the question . Michael admired my appearance , I know . But  --  we simply stayed very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dam-fort liked him . Please leave it at that . " " Of course , " said Newton Wood . He paced off to the fireplace , once more . Oh , yes , she was going to be in the biography of Michael Majendie , this brilliant man who had been killed over a woman . It would be better than having been an ambassadress . Nobody cared about Memories of Two Embassies . But they would care about a book by a man whose novels sold sixty thousand copies . " Can I have this photographed , Mrs. Damfort ? " he asked . " The Sargent . " " Why ? " " As an illustration . " " An illustration in your book ? But that 's making me too important , Mr. Woodl " " Are you sure you were n't pretty important ? " Mrs. Damfort stared at the floor . She would be important in this book , with " Sargent " in fine print under the photograph . She would be there . Selene had said in Memories of Two Embassies , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twin sister 's house on Long Island burned in 1920 . . . " and that was all there was about Mrs. Joel Damfort in the long book . Mrs. Damfort remembered Grandfather Blake cackling , " Freddie always gets the best of itI " in the garden at Nyack when she got the rake away from Selene . Yes . She would be in a book about a man killed over a woman , about a brilliant artist who was shot about his woman . People would read the whisper of her importance to him . Whisper and whisper . " I must think . When does the book come out , Mr. Wood ? " " In May . Please ? " " Oh , yes . Oh , perhaps I was of some importance to him , Mr. Wood . A littler " " You 're a brick , " he said . When he was gone she strolled down the room for a cigarette . It had been so right not to smoke . It had been so right to be the beautiful Mrs. Joel Damfort in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whitehairedbut still slim and still beautiful . Selene was distinctly thick now . Her white skirt whispered on the maroon rug . Whisper and whisper . The book would be out in time for summer . People would read it at Southampton . Young men would ask to be brought to tea . Whisper and whisper . A famous man had loved her a little , they would whisper . More than a little . You should have seen her when she was young . That 's Mrs. Damfort . You should have seen her in 1900 . He was insane about her . Whisper and whisper . " How 'd you get on with Wood , mother ? " " Very nicely , Gordon . He seems very agreeable . Tactful , too . " " Tactful about what ? " She touched his nose with the cigarette . " About not asking awkward questions , sonny . " " ' Bout what ? " " You 'll see it all , " she said , " in the biography .
