( See front cover ) <P> When Henry Ford 's Oscar II sailed out of New York Harbor one December day in 1915 to end the World War , its rail was lined with the most distinguished collection of nave idealists the U. S. had laughed at in many a year . Aboard the Peace Ship were Rosika Schwimmer with a black bag full of papers from the Premiers of Europe , Feminist Inez Milholland , Publisher Samuel S. McClure , Judge B. B. Lindsey , Governor Louis B. Hanna of North Dakota , many another headliner of that era . Also aboard was a husky youngster of 21 who was neither distinguished nor nave . The name of Emil Hurja was on the Oscar II 's passenger list because the University of Washington was sending this student abroad as its peace delegate . Last week Franklin D. Roosevelt 's chances of being re-elected President of the U. S. next November would be considerably less than they are if it were not for the off-stage activities at Democratic national headquarters of that onetime peace delegate . Emil Hurja @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas 1915 , but he seems likely to keep his boss in the White House from 1937 to 1941 . <P> Knockabout . Smallest ( 6 ft. , 1 in. ) of five sons of a Finnish miner in Crystal Falls , Mich. , Emil Hurja had left home at 16 , hoboed his way West . He had sampled his luck in Butte , Mont. , Yakima , Wash. , Fairbanks , Alaska and Seattle , worked as a grocer 's delivery boy , a printer 's devil , got a night post-office job while he went to school by day , studied at the University of Washington , newshawked in Alaska 's mining camps . After the Oscar II interlude he went to Washington , became secretary to Charles A. Sulzer , Alaska 's delegate in Congress . During the War he served in the finance division of the Army , later married a blonde girl named Gudrun Andersen , daughter of a Yukon prospector . They moved to Breckenridge , Tex. , the heart of a contemporary oil boom . The night they arrived there was a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table in one of the town 's play parlors . Emil Hurja started the Breckenridge American . All his life he had been familiar with mining in Michigan , Montana and Alaska . Oil drilling was a kindred occupation and in a few years his paper gained considerable reputation in mining and oil circles . One day a New Yorker dropped in to ask him a few questions . The upshot was an invitation to go to Manhattan and work for Joseph D. Gengler , specialist in mining securities on the New York Stock Exchange . <P> In 1927 Hurja sold his Texas paper , took his wife to a Manhattan apartment on Riverside Drive , settled down with sheets of statistics to chart the flow of gold and oil , their output and their probable consumption .
