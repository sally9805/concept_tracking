txt General Hugh S. Johnson , newly named progress director for Federal relief projects here , conferred for almost an hour yesterday with Mayor La Guardia at City ; Tan on the duties of the new job . Asked after the conference whether he had any program to announce , General Johnson said : " No , I 'm just trying to find out what it 's all about . I do n't know anything about the job yet , and the Mayor seems to know all about it . It 's a complex situation and I wo n't announce any plans until I know all about it . It will take at least a week or ten days before I will be familiar with my duties . " Mr. La Guardia said he had considered establishing offices for the new administrator in the Port Authority Building , but would wait until the general decided where he wanted his headquarters . General Johnson held a half-hour conference last night at his suite in the St. Regis with Francis Boardman , director of the works division of the Emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference was to get facts and figures to help him familiarize himself with his job . Both officials said that no decisions had been reached that were of public interest , $1,100 a Man a " Handicap . " General Johnson explained after the City Hall conference that this task was new to him . When his newspaper column of Tuesday , in which he said the new Federal program was " a more ambitious kind of leaf-raking , " was mentioned he said : " I believe that the pay limitation of $1,100 a man on projects is a distinct handicap in doing any sort of permanent work . I 'll stand on what I said , but it is true that permanent work can be carried out through an averaging rule we can apply on wages . " In the same column the general said the Federal plan " looks like $4,000,000,000 worth of boon-doggling . " The Mayor said there was no boon-doggling in the list of city projects already approved by the Federal authorities . " I have no idea of revolutionizing this whole thing , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization as little as possible , and I will disturb work relief as little as possible . Where existing agencies are carrying this work forward satisfactorily , they will continue doing so . I have nothing to do with the State TERA . My work is as separate a project as if it were in a different State . The function of the Federal Government , as I see it , is only to supervise the conduct of work relief . " Status of . Dock Commissioner John , named by the Mayor to cooperate with General Johnson , also attended the conference . When a reporter asked whether Mr. would have a free hand , General Johnson laughed and said : " There is no question involved of giving Mr. a free hand . You ca n't get a rise out of me that way . " Asked why he had taken the post , the former NRA chief said : " I took it because the President asked me to take it , and I can hardly afford to take it . There 's nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you fellows know what that means . I know very well what it means . " General Johnson receives no salary , but will get $25 a day for expenses . Miss Frances Robinson , the secretary who became known as " Robbie " in the NRA days at Washington , is in the city . When General Johnson was asked whether he had chosen any aides , he said he had made no decision on his staff . The works administrator will divide his time between this city and Washington , reporting directly to Harry Hopkins , Federal work relief director . The general said he expected to be in Washington today . After Mr. Johnson had left Mayor La Guardia discussed the request of the Emergency Relief Bureau for a record appropriation of $20,531,000 for July relief . In this connection he said he expected the new relief set-up to bring substantial economies in administration . As the Federal Government steps out of the picture on home relief , the Mayor said , the TERA will continue on that type of relief . He explained that the July relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not yet officially in effect , and he added there would be no vote on the July appropriation at tomorrow 's meeting of the Board of Estimate . General Johnson expects to see the Mayor again on Monday , when further plans for Federal supervision of work relief beginning July 1 will be discussed . 33nauth Appeals for Jobs . Oswald W. Knauth , chairman and executive director of the Emergency Relief Bureau , told a group of business men at the weekly luncheon of the Kiwanis Club that a movement must be started to put men back to work . Otherwise , he said , it is inevitable that relief must continue . Mr. Knauth characterized work relief as " useless by its nature , " and he told the business men that they might as well put people to work and get some value out of their efforts , for " you foot the bills , willy-nilly . " In work relief , he said , the need for creating jobs with a minimum expenditure for materials and without coming into competition with private industry inevitably results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief , he declared , has been an " ' Alice-in-Wonderland ' set-up , " but he added that until such time as people can return to private employment , it must go ahead . Speaking of home relief , Mr. Knauth said that " the present allowance of $12.60 a week to a family of four is not too much " and was not destroying a man 's incentive to work . He declared that the relief administration was " fairly efficient . " Says PWA Aid Will Continue . Arthur S. Tuttle , acting State director of the Public Works Administration , announced he had been assured by Harold L. Ickes , Secretary of the Interior and Public Works Administrator , that the PWA would continue to make loans and grants for public works projects . Mr. Tuttle made the announcement in the office of the State administration , 2 Lafayette Street , after his return from Washington , where he attended a conference of acting PWA directors of nineteen States . The administration is authorized to make grants up to 45 per cent . Mr. Tuttle stressed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those de ; aying in the hope of receiving more liberal conditions . Under the new PWA decentralization plan , Mr. Tuttle said , it will not be necessary for an applicant for a grant to go to Washington . All examinations will be made in the State office . The new procedure provides for immediate cash payment to a borrower or grantee of a substantial amount , Mr. Tuttle explained , making funds available for preliminary work . The new organization for PWA projects , as distinct from work relief projects , provides for payment of the prevailing wage scale in the community where the project is undertaken . Mr. Tuttle said that the prevailing rate would be determined by the fiscal agent of a city , and in smaller communities in this State by Elmer F. Andrews , State Industrial Commissioner . Previously the PWA had established a minimum wage that was used as a " yardstick . " Mr. Tuttle said he did not believe that New York City would be affected much by the new wage plan , but he believed wages would be lowered in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arnold Hill , acting executive secretary of the National Urban League , sent telegrams to Mayor La Guardia and Mr. Hopkins in protest against General Johnson 's appointment . Mr. Hill declared that General Johnson 's record as NRA director had been characterized by a complete failure properly to recognize the Negro . In support of this contention , he asserted later that Negroes had not received employment on the clerical or administrative staffs of the NRA . Further , Mr. Hill said , the NRA codes had been drawn in such a way that they made " geographical distinctions " in that they provided reduced wages for certain types of work in certain parts of the country . Mr. Hill added that if such policies were put into effect here under General Johnson 's administration they would increase tension in race relations .
