found three other women at home . There are not many calls left for to-morrow , she was thinking , as she consultedthe list Stephen had given her . Only twenty men in the town who have wives . Now she realized that , in the afternoons Stephen had taken her to the tennis courts and in her calls to-day , she had seen them all . " Why , I 'm the only young woman in the place . Where shall I find a woman friend ? It seems a little lonely . I wish Stephen were here . " When she entered her house she found Jim seated by the fire . " I 've come , " he said , " to see if you 'll be a kind of mascot for me this winter . Ride on my ice boat in the Saturday races . " " I , only , among the women am young , " thought Hester and she felt proud , as if she had achieved this distinction by her own effort . P101THE months passed , and Hester spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day after day , the sun reached her windows . She would not let the servants close the blinds , as was the custom in the town , for she wanted the sun to wake her , streaming across the gray painted floor , across the counterpane . Before she was dressed she would hear the first low tones of the wind beginning far off , drawing nearer , soughing in the chimney like organ music . Steadily the wind mounted and with it came to Hester an unfamiliar excitability , a futile energy . Strange new land , a rough frontier offering enervating ease and at the same time holding to her lips that stinging raw stimulant compounded of dry thin air , crystal clear sunlight , never-ending wind . It brought her to no happy achievement , only to nervous activity . There were times when her desire to play her violin left her completely . Then she was distraught , certain that never again would life render itself for her in the beauties of sound , forgetting , in the blackness of the moment , that the ecstatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lassitude controlled her , absorbing the very core of her vitality . Hour after hour , she would sit curled in the corner of the mammoth Russian couch Stephen had bought from Tim , one foot under her , the other loosely suspended over the side . Where was Stephen ? Out somewheretraveling in a cart like those which she heard creaking above the wind , iron-studded wheels complaining , the deeptonedcart bells tolling . How far away he seemed from this snug room . At five o'clock she began holding her court ; sometimes before , for a few left their offices early to see her alone . De/light in her beauty looked out at her from Jim 's eyes , from many a griffin 's , from an old Frenchman 's . They vied with one another for the privilege of being her escort . " My luck 's good , " said Jim as he crossed hands with her skating out over the ice , the night of the carnival . " Jim , is n't it lovely ! " Hester looked with delight about the matting shed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glittering scene of shimmering ice , flags of many nations , colored lanterns , men and women in fancy dress . " You 're the loveliest thing about it in that Priscilla costume . That white kerchief against your throat sets off your color . " Pleased with Jim 's discriminating praise , Hester was a proud and graceful figure , enjoying to the full her youth , when the commissioner 's wife entered . She did not know that the haughty glance which the older woman threw over her shoulder as she skated past was because of Jim . The door opened to admit a short figure clad in the white gown and baggy trousers of a Korean , a black buckram hat perched jauntily on top of the head . " Why , it 's the boss ! " she exclaimed . Smoking his long Korean pipe , the boss strolled up to her as she stood resting for a moment . She had never known him to be so friendly . The costume seemed to set him at his ease . " Why , I 've never thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boss . " She wondered what his life was like , his wife still away in England . Was he ever lonely ? It was three o'clock when , with the ice so powdery that it was impossible to skate longer , Hester consented to sit down and let Jim take off her skates . As they went out , with a sigh of regret she looked back at the great shed , the hundreds of lanterns , one by one going out , the tables with their clutter of coffee-cups and plates half-full of sandwiches . She wished she did n't have to go home to her empty house . But when she reached the door , it was Kin who let her in.  |p103She  gave a cry . Stephen must be at home . There he was waiting for her , asleep in his chair . As she sank down beside him , he opened his eyes . But in the instant before he had wakened she saw Stephen as she had never seen him before , off guard , lines of patience and resignation in his face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an older man had been let down over his youth . Youth ! Could it be so easily destroyed ? " Have you had a good time , sweet ? " he asked gently after he had kissed her . " I 'm so glad . " " But , Stephen , " she demanded , " how did you come to be home ? And why did n't you come to the party ? " " Oh , well , I was late , " he said . The suspicion crossed her mind that he had been here all the evening . She felt worried about him . After each trip he seemed less able to mingle light-heartedly in the doings of the town . Sometimes even on the defensive , she thought . " See what I 've brought you , " he said , speaking a little shyly as he always did when he made her a present . She noticed by his chair a bundle tied in a square of blue cloth , the corners knotted together . " Open it quick , " she cried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heels , the wide skirt of her gray gown spreading around her . Without haste Stephen untied the knots ; at last he shook out the soft folds of a fur garment . " Oh , Stephen , what I 've always wanted ! A fur coat ! Why , Stephen , it 's sable ! " " Slip it on . I thought it would suit you . You should have had a fur coat before now . Your cloth one is n't warm enough for Manchuria . " The long Chinese garment fell to her heels and the sleeves hung down below her hands . " It 'll make me a lovely coat . I 'll get the Chinese tailor to-morrow . I can have it ready for the ice races . " " It 's Russian sable , " said Stephen . " It 's better than the Chinese . "  | " My dear , you 're very good to me ! " cried Hester . Only ten days and Stephen was gone again . Hester was busy making the coat after the pattern of one brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fit , then at the slowness of the tailor , fearful it would not be ready for the races . But when the night came she walked beside Jim , wearing her sable coat and a close little cap made from the left-over pieces . " Lord , you 're pretty ! " exclaimed Jim . " Those cunning black curls round your cap . I ought to win with anything as pretty as you on my boat . Steve 's missing a lot . " They were on the sled now , Jim lying flat , the rope of the sail in his hand . Hester threw herself down beside him , feeling like a little girl again clasping the side of her sled in the New England hills . Lifting her head she could see the other boats in a row to the right . The moon shone down on them , making their sails gleam . The town , Tim 's palace , the custom-house , the curved roofs of native buildings seemed cut out of black cardboard . Then they were beyond the ugly sheds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of black . For one instant , as they flew past , Hester saw silhouetted against the ice a Chinese , heavy as a bear in his padded garments , standing on his rude sled , pole in hand , pushing it forward . Then she forgot everything but the thrill of the boat skimming along . She and the boat and Jim , one harmonizing whole , answering the wind . The boat leaped wildly as it struck ridged ice that the tide and wind had whipped to roughness as it froze . Jim swerved around a pile of jagged ice like great rocks , white in the moonlight . Hester , her eyes almost level with the river , saw two boats shoot out ahead of them . " Hold tight , " Jim said . " I 'm going to let out full sail . " She felt the jerk of his body as the sail , caught by thesavage wind , yanked at the rope in his hand . They shotforward . There was no other boat to be seen on the river.  |p105They  had won . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company . Suddenly the wind caught the sail and flung the boat this way and that . It was like riding a wild horse trying to free itself of its rider . Jim 's fur coat yanked itself from her hand , the boat shot from under her and she gasped , her breath knocked out by the hard impact of the ice . She saw the boat , its sail snow-white in the moonlight , she saw two shards of steel , moving down upon her . . . . Then Jim 's voice shaken with fear . " Speak to me , Hester . " She rose , standing dazed before him . Too dazed to resist his arms , his lips pressed against hers in a kiss that seemed to draw the very life out of her . Then he let her go , talking raggedly . " Hester , I thought I was going to kill you . I . . . kill you . . . . I saw the boat going straight for your head . Then something happened . . . . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You lay between the runners . Even the wind loves you . " There was a pause . . . . Jim spoke again , naturally now . " Well , you 're safe . Suppose I 'd killed Steve 's wife . I 'll take better care in the future . " And Hester almost believed what had happened between them had been a dream . Soberly now they made their way to the sled . Jim furled the sail until the wind had little surface against which to push . So they crept back to receive the medal of honor . Mechanically Hester saw Jim taking into his hands the silvertrophy . . . . That burning kiss . Never had Stephen kissed her like that . A realization of inadequacy in his love reached her . If only it had been Stephen , not Jim . . . . She did not love Jim . The day after the ice races , Hester needed her old world of harmonious sound to reestablish her . But there was no music anywhere . At first , when she came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women have pianos , " Jim had told her . " The wife of one of the pilots has the best one . She 's English . " This Englishwoman played accompaniments . " Of an eveningwhen we all do our bit , I play if any one sings , " she had told Hester . " Some of the men have nice voices . " With eagerness Hester had entered this Englishwoman 's house , but she never went again . Her delicate ear still remembered that untuned piano and the long-drawn-out horror of the afternoon . The other pianos were as bad  --  or worse . Who was there to tune them ? There was no music anywhere . Now , sitting idly by the fire , she looked out at the blank brown surface of her compound wall . Suddenly there reached her over the wind the Chinese high wailing dirge for the dead , gusts of feeling , elemental emotions filled with the mystery of something that the old know but the young do not . Hurriedly she caught up her cloak , ran out along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and threw open the gate . There was the meager white man 's town fading into the plain , and strident against it the brilliant , exotic procession of the dead  --  the great catafalque in red trappings suspended betweenred poles , the beggars who carried it , their rags flapping below the green garments of ceremony . Ahead in sackcloth walked the mourners , still farther ahead , the musicians . The wind flung fragments of the dirge back to her . It set her spirit jangling . She hurried into the house , away from the disturbing death wail . As she sat , her hands clasped tensely together , apprehensiveof its repetition , she heard the tinkle of the gate bell , the shuffle of the coolie 's feet along the passage , a man 's quick step on the veranda . " Hello , there . May the griffin come in ? " Hester jumped up . " Oh , I 'm so glad to see you . " With an eagerness the situation did not seem to call for , she advanced to meet a blonde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress.  |p107Then  the door opened as a servant brought the tea-tray and , with it came the scraping sound of a one-string violin , the high falsetto of a man 's voice , singing . Hester spoke sharply . " Shut the door . " Her voice was shrill with irritation . " I wo n't have the cook playing . He 's got to stop it this instant . " " Here , I 'll take a hand , " said the young man , " I 've learned enough Chinese to do that . " He strode along the passage to the servants ' quarters . The music stopped abruptly . Hester was half-laughing , half-crying , when he returned . " Oh , thanks , " she said eagerly , " I ca n't stand their music . It does something to me . It makes me into a mad woman . " " Ca n't stand the racket you mean , " he said scornfully , sinking into a chair . " Well , I 've settled them . I guess they wo n't bother you again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on you because you 're a woman . " Hester looked at him with amusement , her poise restored . How full of male superiority he was . However , it was nice to have a man take a hand . But how quickly this boy had acquired the lofty tone toward the Chinese that was habitual to so many of the people of the town . Stephen never spoke like that . She wondered why . It was all an enigma to her . Walter Cheatham got up , moving restlessly about the room . " How do you stand it here ? " he asked , as he sat down beside her . " It 's indescribably dreary , this town . To think I 'd pictured China as something like a Maxfield Parrish drawing . " " Poor dear , " murmured Hester , patting his hand lightly . " There 's nothing on this afternoon that we could do , is there ? " " No . Wind too high for ice-boating . The skating rink 's no good , too much dust has got in through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag 's up at the entrance , saying so . . . . I wish the boss would let me travel . I wonder when he 'll think I know enough . I know enough now if he only thought so . I understand these Chinks . Did n't I tend to ' em in the kitchen just now ? I 'd push them , American business drive  --  that 's the stuff . "  | " Yes ? " Hester knew how Stephen would hate such talk . " Let 's dance . " She jumped up , swept into one of the unaccountablerestless moods that came upon her here . She put a record on Stephen 's victrola . After a few moments of dancing , she left the young man . " Wait a minute , " she called over her shoulder , " it 's too dark here . " In answer to her ring , the coolie came bringing a lamp . " Look , " cried Hester , " is n't it funny ? See , he 's got cotton stuffed in his ears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at poor little Li Tsu . He 's going to howl in a minute . He never likes the victrola . " " It 's an insult to you . " Cheatham 's face darkened as he strode toward the coolie . " Do n't , Walter . " Hester laid a detaining hand on his arm . " The coolie and Li Tsu are just like me . It 's not their music , so they do n't like it . " It was after Cheatham had gone that the echo of her laughter came back to her and the voice in which she had spoken to the servant  --  the hysteria of her voice , the rasp of her laughter , thin tinkling hilarity . She no longer understoodherself . The next morning , turning again to sleep , cuddling into the soft nest of her bed , Hester heard the clatter of Stephen 's hobnailed shoes on the floor of the passageway . She sprang out of bed , now for the first time realizing how lonely she had been without him . He held her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his protective substantial self  --  Stephen not played upon as she was with conflicting emotions . Through her silk nightgown the icy cold of Stephen 's greatcoat penetrated to her body . She felt it chilling her flesh , and vigor and poise returned to her . Suddenly Stephen realized how thinly clad she was . " Hester , you 'll catch your death of cold . Into bed this minute . "  |p109She  lay again in her warm bed , watching Stephen pull off his great boots . " My , it 's good to get home . What have you been doing , Hester ? " " Nothing much . What have you ? You look so , so , so .. . I ca n't explain it . " She remembered his look in that moment she had caught him off-guard the night of the carnival . " Well , certainly not as if you 'd ever lived in New York  --  kind of stripped of city sleekness , kind of rubbed down like a nice clean blade . " " Hester , you 're funny . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 're the sleek one . Like a kitten that has been stroked the right way . " " Oh , Stephen , " said Hester , reproachfully . Thus their spirits , moving a moment before with such intensity on such different planes , sought to regain each other.  |p110HESTER  went about her house filled with the vitalizing presence of Stephen . But there was more than the presence of Stephen changing the atmosphere of her home . There was Kin . At night after he had brought the coffee , he stood by his master 's chair ignoring her , telling Stephen the transactionsof the day . This was the relationship of servant to master when the servant 's personality took on dignity . Hesterfelt herself shut out . Only now and then did she catch a Chinese word that she understood , and the long-flowing incomprehensible conversations annoyed her . " What does he say ? " " I ca n't seem to tell you . " Stephen was listening intently to Kin . Although he had talked the language for several years , he still had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you know what he 's saying ? " " Yes , I know in Chinese but it 's not easy to translate . " Hester felt hurt . Stephen did not want to let her into the discussion . She did not comprehend that he was thinking in Chinese , and the English words were not ready to his mind . Kin waited patiently for his opportunity to go on . " Why do you let him take up our evenings like this ? " she demanded one night . " It seems to me it 's out of place in a servant . " Stephen looked troubled . " I ca n't explain . I do n't know . He does it on the road and somehow I ca n't put it in words  --  but Kin thinks it 's the proper thing . And I 've learned when the Chinese expect a thing , that you get along better if you hold to their standard . " Hester looked at her husband curiously . Was Kin the master of Stephen , or Stephen the master of Kin ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was he good ? " Stephen , " she said , when Kin had gone out , " what do you know about Kin ? Is he a good man to have around the house ? " " What do you mean ! " " Why , what 's his character like ? " " How do I know , " her husband replied . " He 's been with you all these years ! " " Well , but how should I know about his personal life ? How could I ? " he replied helplessly . Reading character in a Chinese face was still impossible for him . To Hester , Kin 's personality seemed to pervade the house . Silently , perfectly he served her when Stephen was at home ; silently , imperfectly when Stephen was at the office ; and penny by penny , in amounts so small that it would be undignifiedfor her to argue with him , he increased the householdexpenses . To-day , a week after Stephen 's return , at the third ring of her bell , Kin appeared before her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of respect . In panic at reprimandingthis man twice her age and filled with his own superiority , she thought at first to ignore the matter . But Stephen had said Kin must never appear before her like that . After she had sent him for the gown , she sat nervously drummingon the desk , looking out at the frozen garden , watching the dry stalks of last season 's sunflowers blowing disconsolatelyin the wind . When Kin returned , she must challengeevery item of expense  --  Stephen had said the bills must come down . His salary would not stand it . Again Kin stood before her , now clad in correct long blue gown , looking very neat with his queue wound around his head . Hester felt somehow , in the presence of his middleagedservant , ridiculous in her youth . " We could not eat two dozen bananas in three days . " Those precious bananas that only now and then appeared in the compradore 's store  --  the few that were not frozen in transit.  | Kin waited . No word passed his lips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bananas . Kin passed on to the next item . Coffee , a pound in two days . Stephen drank a great deal she knew , but , surely not that much . " I shall not pay it . " Silent , without change of expression , Kin waited . Heste. nervously entered the amount , went on to the next and the next item until the accounts were finished . Kin closed his book . " Coal . " He spoke but the one word , disdaining to explain why twice as much coal had been used since his return as before . Hester felt angrier than she had ever been in her life . How dared he demand coal so soon ? She jumped up , knockingover a vase on the desk , caring not at all , and flew down the passageway to the kitchen . Kin righted the vase , then quietly followed . In the kitchen sat the cook , idle , the fire out . " Why are you not getting the master 's tiffin ? " demanded Hester in a shrill voice . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hester 's throat . She felt a burst of fireworks in her brain as red-hot primitive anger flamed within her . She heard herself shouting , glad that she was shouting , as she pounded on the table until the dishes rattled . Kin stood in the door , the cook sat at the table . Neither moved , neither gave the slightest indication that they heard her outburst . Suddenly , Hester 's anger collapsed in humiliation . She threw down the coal money and fled to her room . Distraught , she moved about , lifting Stephen 's personal belongings , his brushes , his mirror , with some vague feeling that they might impart to her something which would command the respect of the servants , respect showed to the master , but never to her . Whence had come such devastating anger ? She longed to forget the undignified scene.  |p113All  at once she felt herself tired . Her muscles ached as if she had been in physical combat . She lay face down on her bed , dropping off to sleep , only to be roused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some not-understood strength . She burst into tears . Thus Stephen found her on - his return at noon . " You must n't let Kin win over you like this . I 'll talk to him . My salary wo n't stand it , " he told her , sitting beside her on the bed . He summoned Kin to the living-room , sitting where Hester had sat that morning to talk to him . The servant 's face was stony . " Prior Born , " he spoke in the measured phrases of his own language , " it is necessary to leave the honorable one . The lady 's custom is not good . She pounds upon the table . " " But I pound on the table when you are wrong , " Stephen exclaimed in astonishment , " and you have never threatened to leave me ! " " It is different , " replied Kin . Patiently Stephen went over each detail of Kin 's duty toward his head lady ; of the head lady 's duty toward Kin , and at last when peace was established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all right now , " he told her . " There were certain forms which you broke this morning and Kin was going to leave , but I 've explained to him that you did not know them . " Hester sat up , staring at him . " So you took Kin 's part ? After telling me not to let him get the best of me , you let him get the best of you ? " " Well , not exactly . You do n't understand , Hester . " " Evidently I do n't . " They had their first quarrel . And over Kin . Afterward , Hester was quiet and Stephen uneasy . She was different from the serene girl he thought he had married  --  thismagnifying of Kin 's importance , for instance.  | They gave their first dinner-party that evening . Looking at Stephen at the other end of the dining-table , Hester found her soreness of heart disappearing : no longer was she able to recapture her grievance . As she talked to the manager of the English steamship company sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an elderly Britisher on her left and the Frenchwoman sitting next him . " Talbott , you know Talbott ? " the Britisher was saying . " Too bad he 's turned out so badly . His Company is sending him home . " " Mon Dieu ! " exclaimed the Frenchwoman . " Such a nice young man . I knew him when he first came out . A little , what shall I say . . . ? But so gay , so childlike . " " Too much for him , " the man answered her , " his love of women . " He looked at the Frenchwoman with an expression of satisfaction , as if he had made a good thrust . " This latest escapade of his was too much even for his Company . Could n't ignore it . " Suddenly I-fester realized how abnormal was the life of these men forced into years of celibacy by their organizations . And for the first time she was really curious about Stephen 's past in this town . He did not seem to be specially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him . Women must have loved him . And that girl who had hurt him so . He never spoke of her . Had he forgotten her ? Was he beginning to love her , Hester , as she loved him ? Her heart see-sawed back and forth  --  he did , he did n't . As the women left the dining-room she managed for one instant to squeeze his hand . When the guests had gone , eagerly she made the first advances . " Stephen , dear , " she said , swallowing hard for she was proud , " you were right about Kin . " And then , saying at random the first thing that came into her head , " Why do n't we have Kin wear his queue around his head all the time , especially when he serves ? It seems so much neater . "  |p115Ste|phen  looked at her curiously . " Just when has Kin worn it so in your presence ? " " Why , this morning when he came in after I sent him out for his long gown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , Hester ? Oh , well , " he added hastily , " it does n't matter . But do n't ever let him do it  --  it 's bad custom . " He was n't going to stir Hester up again by explaining that the queue was only wound about the head when it was necessary to get it out of the way . It was as disrespectful for Kin to come before Hester thus as it would have been for one of her guests to have come to her dinner-party with his coat off . Stephen felt a strong desire to kick Kin . The man had won , got away with an insult to his wife  --  and he 'd let him do it . Idiot ! He stood in absent-minded silence , wondering if he would ever learn to understand this race . Wistfully , Hester watched him , feeling herself shut out by his preoccupation . This husband of hers  --  that kiss of Jim 's . She missed something in Stephen 's love . From some heretofore unknown depth of loneliness , she cried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes of the Chinese . " Now that Stephen was home , it seemed to Hester that they lived always in the eyes of the Chinese . Muffled in fur coats , they hurried along the path . The hobnails on Stephen 's shoes resounded against the frozen earth as if one metal was being struck against another . Hester wished they had not had to come . Really it was too cold . But it was the boss 's fiftieth birthday . Stephen had explained to her that they must not fail to show respect to him to-day ; in the eyes of the Chinese it would be discourteous if they did not . The eyes of the Chinese . They were walking straight into the wind now . Hester tried to speak but could only gasp as the ice-cold air cut into her lungs . Even though Stephen stepped ahead to shieldp116her from the wind 's mighty drive , she had to pause in the sheltered garden to get her breath before going in to meet the boss . Stephen said " sir " when he addressed the boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a power in the Company , but because he cared for him , and wanted to show him respect . So did Jim , who had just entered . Hester , an onlooker in their man 's world , understood better now the boss 's utter contentment in this town ; he was respected , loved . She watched with sensitive sympathy his gruff pleasure in the friendship of the two younger men . As the three stood talking , the door was flung wide open by the house-boy , and into the room filed such a company as Hester had never seen . " Who are they ? " she whispered to Stephen . " They 're the agents . Jimmy , they 're certainly doing the old boss honor ! " Stephen whispered back . " They 're all here  --  from all over Manchuria . You do n't know what that means . Even Liu from up the Sungari . He 's had to travel days in a cart , and he hates travel . All Chinese hate travel the way a cat hates water . I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see them with my own eyes . " Hester was nudging his elbow . He saw mirth beginning to break over her . " Do n't laugh , " he whispered almost fiercely . Suppose Hestershould laugh and make these agents lose face ! But surely the compradore was a sight to betray any one into mirth . Stephen had not noticed him until now . He was clad in satin , as were his fellow-countrymen , not the conventionalgown reaching to his heels , but satin trousers cut like the white man 's , cuff and all , a purple satin swallow-tail coat and , encircling his thin neck , a starched white collar with wide bat-wings of pink . " Progress ! " whispered Jim with a cynically raised eyebrow . Led by the odd figure of the compradore the agents advanced . Three times they saluted the boss , shaking their ownp117hands , murmuring " Kon shi , kon shi . " In silence receding . Alone , the compradore came forward , presenting the boss with two scrolls . Then with dignity so great that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearing something very heavy , wrapped in red paper . With his two hands he presented it to the boss who , embarrassed , deposited the parcel on the table behind him . Jim tore off the wrappings . The last red paper fell away . A great incense burner , and of pure gold ! No one could mistake that soft gleam . These old-time Chinese knew nothing of alloys . Hester felt ashamed of her mirth . She sensed something big in the moment : the wind and dust whirling by the windows , the purple-clad throng making genuflections before the shy , insignificant-looking man of her own race . But Stephen knew that only to a person very great among them would the merchants make such a gift , one whose power they had felt , one whose business acumen they greatly respected , one who had outwitted them in many a closely contested battle . The house-boy , with an air of deference matching the total respect accruing to the boss on this occasion , entered with glasses of sherry . Austerely , the agents sipped the unaccustomedforeign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , folding their hands in their sleeves , they filed out . Jim , Stephen and Hester broke into excited exclamation , but the boss himself showed only discomfiture . " What will a simple old fellow like me do with a gold incense burner ? I 'll have to put it in the vault at the bank . My payment to the king of the robbers would n't protect me now . " " He was pleased , was n't he ? " said Hester , as she and Stephen walked home arm in arm , the wind at their backs . " Yes , he could n't help but be . It places him very high in their regard . Only a few white men ever attain it . " They fell silent , Stephen oppressed a little with the thought of those agents , in the mass a formidable foe , his old un/certainty returning and the sense of his youth  --  how had he ever had the affrontery to accuse them of misdeeds ? Was this the China Stephen lived in ? Hester was thinking . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incisive ancientpattern was being pressed into her , making her spirit quiver . Let her hide herself in this stout little town , its gaiety , its frivolity.  |p119IT  WAS a spring morning . As Hester and Stephen walked toward the office soft air touched their faces . When they reached the bund , out on the river in the direct line of their vision , a rusty old tramper had just dropped anchor . " Look , " said Stephen , " the first steamer ! Winter is really over . The river is open ! " Hester stood transfixed , watching the human mass packed on the decks of the tramper , seething up and down , spilling over the sides of the ship . Scrambling like rats , men dropped into the flat-bottom scows beneath . The scows , soon packed as the decks of the steamer had been packed , pushed off , landed their human freight on the pontoons , on the ice-floes jammed against the bunding wall , and hurried back for other loads . Soon Hester saw swarming up the ramps that lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dirty past all belief , the marks of disease upon them . " Where did they come from ? What does it mean ? " Hesterplied Stephen with questions . " A lot of peasants from China come to plant the crops . " " From China ? Is this China ? " " Hurry home , where it 's clean , " said Stephen , kissing her . Why should Hester know that out of the oldest province of China , where the race had been conceived thousands of years before , out of the valley of the river called " China 's Sorrow , " this surfeit of humanity came each spring to this rich outer country to work in the fertile fields , returning in the autumn to their clans to live meagerly on the hoarded pittance until the next spring ? Why should Hester know anything about it ? But when Stephen had left her , Hester lingered within the shadow of the two walls that bounded the lane leading top120the bund . These women with their hoof-like feet , hobbling forward , leaning on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their sagging breasts ! What was it that was written in their faces ? Men , and women and children  --  such children ! What was it stalking behind their eyes ? As she walked slowly home , something half comprehendedmoved like a shadow before her , falling over her house , her comfort , her security . Something that the spirit denied . Stephen , too , was held by the sight . During the morning he went often to the window of his office to stare at China 's glut of humanity moving toward the great stretches of fertile plain . Like swarms of locusts they seemed , devouring Manchuria'splenty . How many thousands , millions , of such people as these were there hidden behind the Great Wall of China ? He tried to imagine what life must be like for any of the Chinese  --  the life of men like Kin , well paid , compared to most . His wages , twelve Mexican , six American dollars a month . Twenty cents a day for Kin and his family to live on . He thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for every extra cash of squeeze in the day 's expenditures . A little he began to comprehend . And yet here was Kin , when he had given him his choice of obeying Hester or of leaving , choosing to give up his security . What was it in the relationship with Hester that made Kin refuse to obey her ? Stephen gave it up . Well , Kin had had to go . He wished Hester could have managed him . He was going to miss him . Kin was like a part of himself , his China self . As the morning wore on , Stephen forgot about Kin , even about that throng , although another ship had come in and the dense mass of humanity pressed close up to the low windows , darkening the room . There was an undertow in the office that pulled at his thoughts . All through the winter , each time he came back , he had felt a growing excitement ; talk of the foreign directorp121who was traveling over China and would be here some time soon ; talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A new note . Change of spirit . Expansion . The next step forward . Many new classmen had been sent out . Two had arrived at the office that morning . From what they said Stephen gained a curiously vivid impression of the Company , self-perpetuating , ever renewing itself with young men eager for success , crowding men like himself forward , men like himselfcrowding upon men like Jim , the boss . What was going to happen if there was to be room at the top ? Was n't the class in New York always told there was room at the top ? As he and Jim walked toward the club at noon , his friend said , " Likely to be fireworks around here when the director comes . " " What 's his plan , anyway ? " asked Stephen . " Expand the organization . Open substations with white men in charge . It 's the highly developed type of organization which they use in America . But the boss contends it 's only a waste of money  --  and it isolates the men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can manage with a simpler organization , he claims . " " So , " was Stephen 's laconic response . " Do you think the boss is right ? " he asked after a short silence . " Sure , " answered Jim . " He understands the Chinese merchantand the director from New York does not . " " Will the boss get himself in wrong ? " " Probably . The director wo n't like difference of opinion , however obediently the boss may execute his orders . " " Where are you going to stand , Jim ? " " With the boss , of course , if I 'm asked . But I 'm only the number two , you know . I probably wo n't be asked . " " Only the number two , " said Stephen . " It sounds near the top to me . " When her front door shut out the shadow of the trek , I Jester moved about her house in a mood of fierce pleasure. 122 OIL FOR THE LAMPS OF CHINAp122Hers , she felt , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kin had brought to it . She knew Stephen had n't wanted him to go , but she did n't care . Something that was rightly hers had been given back to her . Never mind the confusion . She did not gloss over the fact that there was confusion , for Kin had taken the other servantswith him when he went . Until now Hester had n't realized how man-made her household , or how perfect had been the mechanism that Kin had created . Stephen had brought a coolie home with him from the office the evening before , but he was as clumsy as a polar bear . The breakfast had been a failure . By noon , from that inexhaustible supply of China 's millions , she had selected a cook . He said that he would get a house-boy for her . She felt proud of her initiative . But after a tiffin of sodden bread and a custard made from bad eggs , and the cook 's disappearance immediately afterward with the advance money for marketing , Hester had to acknowledgethat she could not read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still there remained to her a sweet sense of activity . Now all her creative energies were awakening . In the midst of a thousand things to do , suddenly she wanted to play her violin . But when she took it from its case a string had snapped . As she hunted through her things for another , she realized that for a long time she had not played . She had been living without music and had not missed it ! A note came from Stephen . Could she manage to entertainthe director and his wife ? They were coming in late that afternoon . The boss had asked if Hcster would look after them as his wife was away . Stephen did n't like to say " no . " He had n't told the boss of Kin 's leaving , and it would seem like an excuse to tell him now . Hester looked at the clock . Four hours before the train was due . They 'd have to have Stephen 's and her room . And there was dinner to get for five of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coolie fromp123the office , and he had a friend who would cook dinner . She could get the boss 's boy to serve to-night . She must n't let Stephen down . At five o'clock the house was clean and fresh as soap and water could make it . But Hester 's brows drew together in concern when she thought of the dinner . The cook did not promise too well . She , herself , had made the mayonnaise for the salad . She was a little fearful that it had curdled . It was all right so long as she stirred it , but when she left it Still , she had charged the cook to beat it the very last minute . She was ready now to join the others at the office . They were all going to the station to meet the director 's train . The floors  --  those painted gray floors  --  how had Kin kept them shining ? If only Kin had not taken the old coolie with him . Well , she had charged the office coolie to wipe his cloth-soled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for such use in the passageway . She stood in the front door and looked back . The coolie had forgotten ! There , in dust on the floor , was the pattern of his huge cloth-soled shoe . Hester looked around , and seeing no one , wiped the mark away with her handkerchief , then closed the front door . The cold spring wind blew through the town . She drew the collar of her fur coat closer round her , as her ricksha-man swung into the line of rickshas before the office . How tired she was , and how puffy and heavy her hands felt inside her white gloves ! But she was happy . The memory of the house all hers now , enfolded her like a blessing . And the road , this long brown road to the station , ruts , dust , ruts , mud . In heat and cold for six months she had traveled this long brown road . Anticipation , fulfillment  --  yes , and renunciation  --  all came to her over this road . So often going to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after seeing him off . The ricksha jarred and shook , wrenching her slight shoulders as it slid in and out of the ruts . . . . Not going to meet Stephen to-day . He was by her side . Darkness had settled over the station , the wind going with the daylight . At last the toot of the engine , the train grindingto a stop , the boss going forward with that characteristic shake of his shoulders , the coolies ' lanterns thrust forward and up . For a moment Hester envisioned New York , city of the successful , as she glimpsed a perfectly attired masculine figure , absorbed in helping a woman alight from the train . And such a woman ! Hester , at Stephen 's side , gave a gasp , almost a sob . " I 'm a frump beside her . " " What do you care ? You 're prettier than she is , " Stephen stoutly affirmed in a whisper . He had his own thoughts . With the sight of the director he was whisked back to that spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world with its twenty crosses , the director  --  this very man  --  coming in after the instructor had given out the appointments , speaking to them of hard work , of loyalty . .. . Suddenly , the vision of Lucy . Stephen straightened his shoulders . Well , he 'd kept faith with the Company . Then through his mind shot the thought , " Does he know I had anything to do with the little lamps ? " And another , " If he does , I 'll never find it out . " Out of what experience was that conviction born ? The moment of appraisal before the two groups mingled was over . Toward Stephen and Hester Jim led a short stocky man with a large paunch , over which a watch chain gleamed . " He looks surly , like a bully , " thought Hester . " Mr. Cobb , this is Stephen Chase and his wife . " The Shanghai manager whom they all feared ! Hester suddenly realized she was a bride , not yet approved . " So you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Stephen . " Yes , sir , " answered Stephen , looking him straight in the eye . He could look him straight in the eye  --  Hester had never slowed him up . " I suppose it 's congratulations . " " Yes , sir , " said Stephen again.  | " Well , you got ' em ! " pronounced the Shanghai manager and turned on his heel , leaving them oddly disconcerted . Then Director Swaley pushed past Cobb 's heavy figure , ignoring the boss and Jim , and came toward them , shaking Stephen 's hand , giving Hester 's gloved one a pat . " It 's to you younger men we have to take off our hats . How many days up-country this last winter ? I saw your record in Shanghai . " A warm glow passed through Stephen . So his work was appreciated after all . With great suavity the director introduced the finished lady to Hester . Then in businesslike fashion he turned his attention to the baggage . " Now , we wo n't bother you with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will you get my wife 's jewel-box and hand-bag ? " " Right , sir . " Hester saw Stephen moving toward the heap of baggage dimly discernible in the station light shining across the platform . How would Stephen know which in all that pile to bring ? In spite of the director 's large kindness , she felt he would not brook the smallest mistake . " Is this right , sir ? " Stephen had returned . " Fine . Put it in my wife 's ricksha . " As Stephen helped Hester into hers , she whispered excitedly , " How 'd you know ? " " Sh , they 'll hear you . Asked his valet , of course . You did n't think they 'd leave jewels around loose , did you , silly ? Where 's your rug ? " It was Hester 's turn to say " Sh . " " The director took it for his wife . Said one was n't enough for her . He did n't notice he was taking mine . But did you say a valet ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demoralized now . " Oh , Stephen , why did we let Kin go ? " Again the brown road , the line of rickshas , longer now , the lanterns hanging from the shafts , the pullers ' legs twinkling in the light . Just ahead of Hester , the director 's wife nestled cozily in her fur coat and two rugs . Hester drew her feet under her for warmth , vainly trying to fasten her mind on her duties as hostess . But all she could think of was the coolie 's large dusty footprint and the director 's buttoned , highly polished shoes , gleaming in the lantern light as he stepped off the train . No more of him , just those perfectly polished shoes . The alley , the path , the rickshas zigzagging their slow approach , and then the house-door flung wide and a glare of light almost blinding them . On tables , along both sides of the hall , were rows of the Company 's little lamps . And there , in a purple silk gown and short , sleeveless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and relief , Hester entered her house . Stephen was angry , too , but not over Kin 's return . Over his officiousness , as he termed it . Confound Kin ! He was sure it was Kin who had put the lamps there . Would the director think he was trying to call attention to them ? After dinner , when the boss and the manager from Shanghai had gone , the four sat for a time with their chairs drawn close around the open fire , a nicely molded structure beginning to turn to ash . " How unusual to have such service here in the wilderness , " said the director 's wife . " Your boy would grace a diplomat 's table . What culture these people have ! How much more poise that boy of yours has than we have , for instance . I simply adore their culture . No wonder sometimes they are a little rude to us . " " Tut , tut , " said the director . " What do you know about this culture , except for the trinkets you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hated conversation like this . What right has the director 's wife to talk so glibly ? What does she know , he thought , about the stress and strain of our slow understanding ? He got up hastily , and passed the cigars to the director . Hester , seeing Stephen 's look of irritation , knowing that because of his growing lack of social awareness , he was apt to break out and show scorn of Mrs. Swaley 's opinions , hurriedlyp127said the first thing that came into her head . " Do take one , Stephen got them especially for you . " The director laughed , a mellow warm laugh . How naive , how unworldly was this couple . Telling him the cigars were especially for him . Or was there more to it ? Those two rows of the Company 's lamps down the hall . Was the young fellowtrying to remind him of his part in those lamps ? More designing , perhaps , than he thought . Aloud he said : " My dear young woman . Of course I 'll take one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow . I 'm going to give him a chance to show what he 's made of . Must n't let us old fellows have all the plums . " Inwardly , he congratulated himself on his penetration . He 'd been right about Chase  --  that idealism of his had certainly proved usable . Thought it would , in a place like Manchuria where a man has to check up on himself . Chase had traveled almost incessantly and without complaint . He thought with amusement of the discussion he and the instructorof the class had had back in New York before the appointments were made , the instructor arguing that Chase 's idealism might make him finicky in business ; he himself arguingthat it was valuable in opening up a new territory like Manchuria . The instructor had said idealism would grow on a man ; he had answered that the time to deal with that was when it proved to be annoying . The Corporation did n't necessarily take a man on for life , he had finally said , and ended the argument . Chase had proved even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little lamps had brought t he Company a lot of money . Well it took all kinds of men to do the work of Big Business . That hard-boiled Kendall , the instructor had liked so much , was doing his stuff too . Great fellow , Kendall , for a special type of work . That shut look of his very usable when it came to a certain kind of negotiation with rival businesshouses . Director Swaley was well pleased with himself , as he smoked his cigar  |p128It  was in excited hope that Hester and Stephen went to bed , lying very close together on Stephen 's traveling cot placed before the living-room fire . " Going to give you a chance , " was what Mr. Swaley had said . " What do you suppose it will be , Stephen , dear ? " " Have to wait and see , I guess , " Stephen answered , but he was inwardly wondering . Now bewilderment absorbed their thoughts . When they had rung for Kin to lock up , they found he had gone as mysteriously as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also . How should they manage in the morning ? What were they to do ? They slept fitfully  --  the bath water , the breakfastfor the Swaleys , filling their dreams . Suppose the office coolie should fail to start the fire ? At four , the house dark and cold , Stephen slipped out of bed to see if the water was being heated . No , the coolie had overslept , and so Stephen lifted to the top of the stove the heavy pails made of old oil tins and filled with water for the director 's bath . At six , Hester , heavy-eyed but valiant , put the cereal on to boil . There was no Kin , no cook . " Stephen , what shall we do when it 's time to serve breakfast ? How shall we explain ? Oh , why did I send Kin away ? " " I 'll never take him back ! The cheek of him acting like this ! " Stephen was indignantly setting the table . " I hear them coming down the stairs , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held by a kind of paralysis . And then , Kin walked gravely in through the door at the back of the hall , and they heard him say to the Swaleys , " Breakfast ready . " The director 's party left at noon ; the valet , the private secretary , the Shanghai manager , Director Swaley and his wife . A shortened line of rickshas returned from the station . Elation and trouble sat on Stephen 's brow . " Hester , " he began , as soon as they were alone , " I 've got my chance . "  | " Not really ! " cried Hester . " Yes , but I 'm afraid it 's going to be hard on you . Shall you mind ? I 'm to open one of the new sub-stations . We sha n't be in a white man 's town , as we are here . But if I make good , the director says " If you make good ! What does making good mean ? I thought you 'd done it already . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd be in the run for big things . " " Why did you say , would I mind ? I 'm as glad as you are that you 've got your chance . " For a moment Stephen held her close , then he hurried away to the office . It was only after he had gone that there came back to her that first impression of the Company . She had seen so many of the tireless hands , but the face , the face was still hidden . Late that afternoon , the boss called Stephen into his office . " It 's all against my recommendation , " he burst out . " I advised them to send you to Harbin . Pretty big sub-station , but you 're up to it . I did n't tell them so , but there 'd be music in Harbin for that wife of yours . Russians always have music . They 're sending your friend , Kendall , that we 're always hearing about , to Harbin instead . This place you 're going to . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you at home . Guess she 's resented the travel a little lately . Well , you 'd better get off as soon as you can . " And Stephen , knowing he and Hester would need Kin in a new town , was glad Hester had said nothing about dismissinghim.  |p130THEY  were going north to their new station . Hour after hour as the plain stamped its extent on Hester 's mind , her thoughts ran back , trying to knit themselves into the local interests of the town they had just left , but Stephen 's mind ran ahead of him , trying to drag Hester 's with it . " I 've got something of a problem on my hands , " he told her . " The agent in this territory is n't going to like it to have a white man over him , and that 's what it amounts to . I 've got to handle it so he wo n't lose face . It 's delicate busi-ness . " " But you like it , do n't you ? " demanded Hester , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Stephen . " Something a little my own , and it 's nice to think I 'll be at home . " " I wonder what our house will be like . " " You must n't expect much , " he answered hastily . " It was originally built for the construction man 's use while he was putting up the tanks . " " I 'm not expecting much . I 'm only wondering . I 'm prepared for anything . " Hester spoke proudly , feeling herself equal to any test . " The most important thing I have to do is to increase the percentage of our business , " Stephen went on . " There 's a free lance there , a man named Blodgett , who buys his oil from the British Company , selling it as he can . He 's taken a great deal of business away from the Company . He 's half British , half Chinese , and he understands the tactics of both . I 'll have to work hard to win over him . " So they came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their own people , moved on without them , they felt themselves drawn together in a new companionship.  | " Here comes Kin , " said Stephen . " By heck , he 's got a big family . I did n't know it . He 'd always kept it dark . He asked permission to bring his son , but he said nothing of the others . They 're girls  --  of course , he does n't count them . " He felt again that Kin had put something over on him , but there was nothing to do about it . They could not afford to lose him . Anyway , nothing seemed an obstacle just now . " Get in , " he cried gaily , leading Hester to the cleanest of the droshkies , and motioning Kin into another . " Where did it come from ? " exclaimed Hester , looking in wonder at the ghost of a grand turnout before her , the curved and imposing arch over the horse 's head all that was left of the old grandeur , padding protruding from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver . " It 's a relic of Russian days , like Tim , " explained Stephen . " Hail , the conqueror ! " Hester murmured , seating herself on the sloping seat . " We 're off ! " cried Stephen , and the decrepit equipage , by a series of starts and stops , advanced through the Japanese city . " The Chinese city is back farther , you ca n't see it from here , " he explained with a wave of his hand , taking pleasure in showing his wife things new to her , familiar to him . " These look like Chinese buildings , " said Hester . " Yes , they 're the bean godowns . They 're here in the Japanese city next the railroad . See the siding running along behind ? The beans have all been shipped for this year , but in the winter you should see the place  --  the matting bean towers and the carts , the dust rising in clouds . You 'd like to hear them counting the measures of beans . This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ling ehr . " " Why , it 's like music . " " Listen to the bean mills  --  hear them ? " Hester could hear the pound , pound as the hand presses came down , squeezing the oil from the beans . " It would make a wonderful symphony , " she said . Her eyes shone.  | Soon they were out on the plain . " Is our house very far away ? " she asked . She had thought , until now , that the house was in the city . " Two miles or more . I supposed you knew that , when I told you it was in the compound with the tanks . Tanks are always off away from the cities . " Hester looked at the brown earth , unrelieved as yet with the spring shimmer of young green kaoliang and beans . The vast treeless surface lay unbroken , except where the squat city behind them hugged the earth . At last , she could see two round oil tanks , half concealed behind a brown mud wall . Like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain . But when the droshky drew up at the corrugated iron gate , tanks and wall grew large dwarfing everything near them . At Kin 's call a caretaker opened to them , thrusting into Stephen 's hands bills of lading that brought vividly to his mind the immediacy of his duties . The oil had arrived to fill the new tanks . Even now cars were being shunted on to the siding at the back of the compound , the caretaker told him . " Hester , I 'll go with you around the house , then I 've got to get busy . They 're waiting now to pump . " " What a funny house ! " said Hester . " It 's like a canary 's cage with its four-sided roof , and its verandas . It 's just about as big , too . " Together they entered the house , passing through the four rooms , each of the same size , each a quarter of the tiny dwelling . " What 's this pillar in the center ? " " The Russian stove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephen . " See the door here at the bottom ? " " I wish we had a fireplace , " Hester spoke a little wistfully . " Fireplaces would n't do . It 's very cold here . " " The furniture is as decrepit as that carriage we rode in , "  |p133Hester  called from the living-room . " Look , the leg of this chair is tied up with string . " " I suppose they sent up a lot of stuff that had been discardedfrom some main station , " Stephen explained . " Oh , it 's all right , " she answered hastily , " I can use it . It will be fun fixing it up . " " You 're fine , Hester . I 'm sure you 'll make it cozy . And , you know , I think we could manufacture some kind of fireplace on that wall across from the stove . " He was grateful for her pluck . The house was pretty awful . " Now I 'll go see about the oil . " He kissed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hester . " Look , here 's a covered passageway . " They went together along it . " Evidently it 's the office . See , here 's where the constructionman worked . Now , I 'll have to go . " Stephen kissed her again . Hester walked slowly back through the rooms , planning what she would do . " The paint is chipped from the beds ; they 'll have to be painted . Chairs recovered . How odd , " she thought , " when it 's finished , there 'll be no one ever coming to see it . Just ourselves . How strange it seems ! " She could hear Stephen directing the men , and she went to the side of the house that faced the tanks . The Chinese coolies had the pipe lines down and had begun to pump the oil . " Anyway , Stephen will be here . It 's going to be nice , " she said to herself . It was six months since Hester and Stephen had alighted from the droshky and crossed the threshold of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hester then , eager to prove herself equal to the test the corporation was putting her to . She had spent the first weeks settling the house , working with eager haste , outraging Kin , who saw all haste as defect . And then for a time she had enjoyed her handi- work . A secret triumph possessed her . She was learning how to subordinate the Company stamp to the stamp of the individual . She thought this , as she walked through her four rooms  --  living-room , dining-room , their room , guestroom , never occupied  --  around the Russian stove , like a pillar , set in the middle of the house . Often , with her violin under her chin , she stood between fireplace and Russian stove , playing the fire-music motif from the Valkyrie . She and fire-music , she and fire-pillar in league against the conformity of chairs , tables , bookcases done in the Company pattern , against the tanks leaning over her , shadowing her , shadowing Stephen , as they shadowed her house . But one day , suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfaction she had had at first in her courage to accept such a life lost its zest . Gradually , monotony reached out its gray hand , stealthily stealing away her high spirits . As day followed day , one exactly like another , indifference settled over her . Nothing seemed worth doing . For six months , for twenty-six weeks , for one hundred and eighty-two days , she had watched the sun march across the metallic sky ; in the morning throwing the shadow of the tanks to the right over the compound wall ; in the afternoon throwing it to the left over her house . Not to be escaped for one moment , the thought of these tanks . Stephen was the guardian of their precious , inflammable fluid . For six months  --  twenty-six weeks  --  they had never been away from the compound for more than a few hours . Even then , Stephen worried . If business took him away for a longer period he left Hester at home to watch , so great was his fear of fire . And ever since that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocking out his pipe on a half-filled barrel of oil , Stephen had made excuses to leave her at home , even on his short trips into the city . All day a watchman stood at the gate , challenging each person who entered . All night a watchman paced the corn/pound , striking his hollow bamboo gong as he went his rounds . For six months , for twenty-six weeks , each night she had gone to sleep to that hollow tattoo and waked if it ceased , feeling Stephen stealthily slipping out of bed to see if the watchman slept at his post . For six months , for twenty-six weeks , she had listened to the wind blow without shift of direction , with no place in the clumsily built house to escape from its jar of the shutters , its whine in the screens of the veranda , its suck through the door latches . One hundred and eighty-two days , when she had felt something urging her to go and bury her head in the brown earth outside the brown house . Surely , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eighty-two days when , after tea , she and Stephen had played solitaire , she on one side of the table , he on the other . Snap , her card down ; snap , his card down . Snap , the King here . Shuffle . Snap , the Jack there . To-day , suddenly she hurled her cards into the dull coals of the grate . " I 'm through , " she exclaimed . " It makes me sick even to think of solitaire . As long as I live I 'll never play it again . " She hated herself for making a scene , for being melodramatic , but she hated Stephen more for paying no heed to what she was doing . His silence condemned her in a way she could not bear , driving her to frenzy . She 'd make him notice her ! She dropped on her knees by the fire , reaching into the live coals for her cards . " Are you crazy ! " Stephen shouted at her , jumping up from the table , snatching her arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had broken and she was crying , her head on his shoulder . " Oh , Stephen , Stephen , I want to go home . " Stephen 's heart almost stood still . This was the sickness of nostalgia . It attacked people in dreadful ways out here . In this strange beautiful north with its high winds and its unbroken sunshine , homesickness had been known to drive people mad , especially women who were pregnant , though that was notp136the matter with Hester , surely . But suppose she broke under the strain . Such disaster he had never contemplated , absorbed as he had been in his work . This was only a sub-station , to be sure , but it had many difficult problems to hold his attention . Still , he reproached himself , he should have taken better care of Hester . . . but she was always so valiant , so full of high courage , so gay . He thought that she had been wholly contentbecause of the increasing depth of their companionship  --  andall the time she had been suffering like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soothe her , he felt completelybaffled by the privacy of her spirit . Was this the real Hester who was pouring her words out so incoherently , not that other buoyant person with whom he thought he had been living all these days ? " It 's so bright here all day , always the same . And that shadow of the tanks , falling over the house . And the nights are so dark . It was never dark at home . There was a streetlampon the corner of the street where our house stood . . . even in the night . . . squares of light on the walls . " " I know , sweet , the first two years I was out here the darkness of the nights got me too , " Stephen broke in on her recital . She had pulled away from him , her hands clasped , dropped between her knees , her eyes peering out as if trying to pierce the distance . She went on in a monotonous voice . " There were people walking along the streets , happy people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night long , dying a little , then beginning again . Stephen ! I ca n't bear the day , and I am afraid to have night come it is so dark . " But she could n't tell him of the void of silence around her . She was secretive about that . " Look at me , Hester , " Stephen tried to speak lightly . " This is n't anything but homesickness . Everybody has it sometime . I did . When I was traveling once . . . " He stopped . He was secretive , too , about that suffering thep137winter before she came , hiding it now even from himself . " But you 'll get over it . After a time you wo n't want to go home . You 'll prefer living out here . " " Get over wanting to go home ! " He saw that he had said the wrong thing . " Dear , is Kin bothering you ? " He 'd hit on the subject at random , and he was surprised at the response from Hester . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The minute you are in your office , he defies me in little ways . At first I did n't know what they meant , but I 'm learning . Kin makes me feel as if I 'm not here . " " What do you mean ? " " I ca n't express it . As if . . . well , as if I 'm really not here . . . as if my spirit were dead in me . " Stephen wondered . The Chinese did not believe that women had souls . Was it possible that Kin , with such a belief , could annihilate that delicate , intricate personality that was I-Iester ? " I 'll send him away if he bothers you . " " But I want to go home . " Stephen felt a knell sounding in this return of Hester to her first cry . How could he distract her ? " Where 's your violin ? " " No , no . Not that ! " If only they could get away for a while ! He thought wildly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not leave the tanks  --  not without permission . He might wire the boss asking leave for a day or two . He remembered that first trip after his marriage , when he had broken through his orders and wired the boss he was returning . How fearful he had been that the boss might report him for insubordination , and how grateful when he found that the boss did not intend ever to mention the matter to him , let alone to any one higher up . He had made the resolve then that he would never take advantage of the boss 's friendship . No he could not ask to go now .  --  Yes , he must for Hester 's sake.  | " Sweet , I 'll ask the boss to send some one up here and give us a little vacation ! " " No , no , not that . It would ruin you , for them to know that I was weak . A chain no stronger than its weakest link . . " Oh , I do n't think so , " answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The boss would understand .. . but if you 'd rather not . . . " What diversion was there here ? He had an idea . They could go shooting . For several evenings he had seen ducks flying . He 'd get his gun without telling Kin . They 'd slip out the side door . Hand in hand , they moved across the prairie , tiny specks on the plain . Ducks flew over . Stephen was a good marksman , his first shot brought one down . Hester saw it fall like a bit of brown mud . " There it is on that hummock of kaoliang stubble , " she cried and ran off after it . Miraculously free of the depression which for weeks had weighed her down , she ran this way and that . Stephen watched her tenderly . She looked childlike in her knickers , her legs so straight and strong flung out in a funny puppyish fashion because of her boots , which made her feet heavy and unwieldy . Suddenly she stopped , puzzled . Among the thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the particular one where the duck had fallen . Stephen shouted at her and waved to the right . She shook her head . It was n't there . She came back defeated by the immense brown sameness . Time after time Stephen shot and the bird fell , but when the light went from the plain without warning of twilight , as it did here , they had bagged only two ducks . " We 've got enough for dinner anyway , " said Stephen cheerfully . " I guess at home we could n't step outside our door and shoot our dinner like this . " " Not in New York anyway , " she said with a half sob  | " When we get in , I 'll insist Kin have them cooked . " Stephen sounded like a child bragging of the way he would command his father , Hester thought . They walked on in silence . After a time they stopped , bewildered . They had lost the house as they had the ducks . The plain had sucked up all distinctions . They swerved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh . To her overwrought nerves her laughter sounded impudent in the vastness of this silent brown manifestationof nature . She only half heard Stephen mumbling , " I should have told Kin where we were going . We may wander round half the night . " At the same moment , they both saw a light . Stephen shouted , and Hester felt the wind swooping at his shout , pushing it down into the plain . Then the light was lifted high , and they saw it was a lantern . It shone down on Kin , wraps over his arm . " Here , what 's this ? " demanded Stephen , taking from Kin his greatcoat and Hester 's thin cloak . " You know better than this . " But Hester understood that Kin had not intended to bring her warm coat . As they followed the light , the girl felt her fright and her little freedom collapse . She was like Kin 's bird which hopped from its perch the length of the string on its leg . By Kin 's grace and his meager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently , relentlessly he brought her to submission . She felt herself his prisoner with invisible humiliations heaped upon her . Despite Stephen 's assurances , she knew nothing would be changed ; and as she passed into the house , Kin 's shadow , black and long , fell across the threshold . At breakfast the next morning , the common things , the coffee-pot , the eggshell white cups with their sprays of bamboo , reassured Stephen . Yesterday was unreal . Hester seemed herself again and he let it go at that , eager to forget that glimpse he had had of the white-hot core of her being . His own inner self had been for a long time well hidden under the cool soil of his companionship with Hester and every-day happenings of his work . Even as he awoke that morning , his mind had immediately taken up the problems of the day . Soon the ground would be frozen . Past their compound would be the steady procession of the carts bound for the city , loaded with beans . When the carts returned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tanks , or tins from the godown in the agent 's compound . The tins of oil were still stored there , despite the complaints of the officials . They did not like oil stored in the city , but for the time the Company , through him , had arranged to leave it there , in order to save the face of the agent . If Stephen took all the stores from the agent , it would look as if the Company did n't trust him . That afternoon , walking across the plain on his return from the city , Stephen felt only contentment . At last the final arrangements had been made . A set of sub-agents , wholly acceptable to the Company , had been chosen by the agent  --  men who had shops in various towns in the territory . This was part of the new scheme the Company had adopted . For him to have failed would have been serious . He felt satisfaction with the day 's work . Under the pressure of these delicate arrangements , Hester 's suffering had been pushed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his cards for a game of solitaire , was he reminded of the events of the evening before . He heard Hester sigh . " You all right ? " he asked . " Yes , Stephen . " " I love you , Hester , and try to make you happy . " " Yes , I know . " She sat opposite , her chin resting in the cup of her palms . For the time , at least , her rebellion had spent itself . PresentlyStephen put aside his playing cards , taking in their place a pile of white cards with Chinese characters written on them . He muttered the meaning of each to himself , then turned the card over , to see if he was right , drawingp141the character in the air with his finger so as not to forget its formation . As she watched him , Hester realized beyond a chance of fooling herself , that the self-respect written in his sensitive face was bound up with his work . Touch his work and you touched his self-respect . She might hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How singular that trade had become her life 's business , she who had wanted only to play the violin . But for Stephen 's sake the Company could have its way with her . Into a world of half-tones Hester now entered . That fierce suffering of the last weeks seemed to have sapped her strength and often , for hours , she lay on her bed , feeling weak and languid . There were mornings when she let Stephen think she was asleep and he would go softly out , leaving her . It gave her a chance not to eat any breakfast , a thing impossibleif Stephen were about . All her former rebellion against the wind and the silence and the darkness seemed concentratednow against the food . It was a heavy monotonous diet that Kin provided . He gave them meat three times a day , usually pork . And sweet potatoes , the native vegetableswere few up here , so he said ; there were no fruits except the puckery persimmon , and an odd Japanese fruit , something like an orange , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could not . There were days when it seemed to her that she would not mind anything else if she could only have an orange . In her dreams , a stand where she had bought fruit as a child often appeared to her . The oranges piled in a mound upon it were so real that , after she waked , she could feel their lovely rounded skins in the palm of her hand . She was alone one morning , exhausted after a struggle with Kin over the accounts . For days she had put off the task , dreading it . Now it was finished and she had shut the door of her room . Perhaps she was going to be ill . If she were could n't she ask Stephen to resign ? Then she was ashamedp142of the subterfuge . She lay on her bed , appalled before the weakness that possessed her . Suddenly she sat up , startled with a new idea . Strange she had not thought of it before . It would explain so many moods , so many feelings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be wholly obedient to the Company now . Indeed , she would not entertain the idea of asking Stephen to resign . The instinct to protect her young had been born in her . For the first time in her life Hester felt material insecurityas a danger , not an adventure , felt the inexorable economic pressure . This , before delight entered every cranny of her being.  |p143WINTER  came , and with each advancing month , north , alwaysfarther north , moved the oil . In brown huts clinging to the rocky hillsides , in brown huts crouching on the plain , the three-cent lamps , with their red bowls and miraculous chimneys , were placed carefully on low k'ang tables . The tiny flames pierced a little the gloom in the dusty rafters where rested coffins , awaiting burial back in the ancestral homes in China , safe within the Great Wall . The wind hurled itself against the huts , as behind the bed curtains on the brick beds the peasants and their families lay sleeping together , protectedfrom evil spirits by the lamps burning on throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , peace , her spirits subdued to the service of her body . And , as Stephen had predicted , no longer the desire to go home . She shrank from society , as once she had sought it . Only when she had to see the doctor , could Stephen coax her across the city where one or two white women lived . Danish women , speaking little English , they seemed as foreign to Hester as the Chinese . The long letters which she had written to her friends in America when she first came to this place of isolation , she ceased to write ; her panic that annihilation would engulf her , if her friends forgot her , vanished . Instead , the more she isolated herself the more intense grew the sense of her own personality mirrored in Stephen 's concern for her . And Kin 's , too . She did not know why , but she had become of importance in Kin 's eyes . Stephen did not worry about her any more . She was a brick . He was coming to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let him down . He was winning through now , beginning to find that he could rely on his own judg/ment in doing business with the Chinese . Funny about that . . . a kind of sixth sense , something as yet not understandablebut successful . It was exciting , like venturing from hummock to hummock in swampy land . Those sub-agents were doing good work , and the agent was cooperating . Slowly the sales in his territory were growing . Slowly , too , he swung the balance of business in favor of the Company , and away from Blodgett . Stephen and his rival had become very good friends , each promising to give the other a fair chance . Then one day Stephen was authorized by his Company to drop prices . He notified Blodgett before he put the reduction into effect . It was on Saturday , when he returned from making his weekly deposit in the Russian bank , that he found Liu , the agent , waiting in his office . Excitedly Liu demanded that Stephen reduce the price again , " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . At once Stephen saw the plan . Blodgett had waited until Saturday to drop prices below those of the Company , knowing that Stephen could not follow without the consent of his organization , and that Saturday noon was too late to get it . But he 'd be ready for him next week-end . He wrote the boss , asking that he be allowed , up to a certainlimit , to use his own judgment about the price cut , both as to amount and to time . That the boss would have to take up the matter with the Shanghai office , Stephen knew . All the week he waited . Early Saturday morning the telegramcame , authorizing him to follow Blodgett 's price drop of the previous week . Stephen was disappointed and humiliated , for all the week he had been soothing the irate agent by the promise of meeting the cut . Week after week it went on , Stephen in the dark as to the policy of the Company . In his little universe , where each small phenomenon was of importance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He thought of little else ; he talked of little else , especially over the week-end when his office was closed.  | " Let 's sleep late , " said Hester on the third Sunday , " then we sha n't have so much time to think . " But Stephen woke earlier than usual . He had been dozing when a new phase of the matter aroused him . He woke Hester before he thought . " It 's damned unfair . Look , I 'm held responsible for the amount of business in this territory , but I 'm given no responsibilityin the method of getting it . Suppose it goes down to nothing , shall I lose my job ? " Now Hester was wide awake , " Why , Stephen , what would we do ? " " I 'm a brute to worry you , " he said , and put forth all his efforts to reassure her . At last the greater resources of the big corporation wore Blodgett down ; but long before , Stephen had ceased to feel any responsibility , other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perfect instrument , the hand , delving , working , but not asking the brain to explain why  --  a good Company man . It was after coolness had grown up between Blodgett and himself over this cutthroat competition that Stephen became interested in the visits of Liu . The agent dropped in often for a chat , and Stephen began to think again of friendship with the Chinese . One day , on an impulse , Stephen asked Liu to come to the house and meet his wife . Hester was delighted at the idea ; now she was going to know the Chinese . Aided by Kin she had tea and cakes ready , when Stephen and the agent entered the house . The little social event had passed off in all correctness . Stephen congratulated himself , although Kin , unaccountably , had not stayed to serve tea . But Hester had risen nobly to the occasion , remembering to hold the cup in two hands when she gave it to Liu . She had played the scene well , lowering her eyes demurely , even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste among the Chinese . He was certain of the success of the venture , when at the end of the call Liu had invited them to feast with him . Hester felt shy , going into the great bare restaurant filled with men , where the feast of Liu was held . In the short distance to the stairway , almost as straight up as a ladder , she felt the eyes of all upon her . Even the slatternly boy standing by the great brass water-kettle gazed at her in such a way that she flushed . Stephen knew that Chinese ladies do not go out publicly with their husbands , but he walked proudly beside Hester to show how he honored her , not realizingthat in exposing her to their gaze , like a sing-song girl , he had given the men cause to believe that he held her lightly . Nor did he realize that Liu believed her to be a favorite concubine ; only such women did a man display . Had not Stephen gone out of his way to let Liu see her ? To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . In reality she was a concubine , bought from a house of prostitutionin Chefoo . Liu was secretly pleased that Stephen had made it possible to bring her to the feast . She sat next to Hester , the first Chinese woman Stephen 's wife had ever met , seemingly too busy splitting watermelon seeds with her even white teeth , spitting the husks on the floor , to take any notice of Hester . From time to time she looked up boldly through her long black bangs at the five men at the table  --  the agent , his partners and Stephen . Occasionally she threw into their conversation sharp terse remarks that each time brought the appreciation of laughter from the Chinese men . As the concubine of Liu spoke in another dialect from the one Stephen had learned , he did not understand her . There were sing-song girls that evening , who came through the door back of Hester , mincing round the table on their bound feet , leaning over the men 's shoulders , pouring out their wine . " The agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly , " said Stephen when they werep147at home again . " We must invite him and his wife here to our house . " But before Stephen arranged this , Liu had invited them to a third feast . On the afternoon of the day , the merchant called on a matter of business . In their long conversation , the question of leakage came up and Stephen gathered , he did not know how , so adroitly did Liu convey his meaning , that if he would falsify the amount of the leakage , the profits might be divided . He was angry and curtly refused . Too curtly , he realized after he had spoken . Fortunately , the agent accepted his defeat gracefully , bowing himself out , clasping his own hands according to the best Chinese custom . " The most miserable one will call in person for the honorableone and his great lady at the hour for the feast . " That hour passed and a second . " Liu 's evidently been detainedand thinks it would n't be polite to send any one else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephen explained for the hundredth time to Hester . " I 'm hungry , let 's eat something , " was Hester 's answer . " We could n't do that , " said Stephen , " we 'd make him lose face . He 'd be sure to find out from the servants . " But at nine , he rang for Kin . " Get dinner . " " There is nothing prepared , " answered Kin , unconcealed contempt in his manner . Now , in a flash , Stephen knew that the agent had never intended to come for them , that this was retaliation for what had taken place that afternoon . For a second time he had let himself in for an insult  --  and this time his wife , too . He writhed inwardly when he thought of the exquisite pleasure Liu was enjoying at this moment , he and his fellows , at Stephen'sexpense . With what zest , contempt and revenge were masked in propriety ! But what had made Liu think he could do this and get away with it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so stupid . He would handle the matter with the approved indirectnessof this country 's custom.  | Throughout the next day Stephen waited patiently , believing that Liu would come to make his apologies , thus completingthe proprieties . He was not disappointed . At four , Liu appeared , a dignified satin-clad figure , the hauteur of race in his bearing . Stephen rose , bowed , motioned the agent to a chair . " I have come , " said Liu , " the first moment that I have been able . At the hour of the feast last evening , my body put forth such fire that I was unable to come . Now if the honorable one will accept my humble hospitality , we will begin feasting . " " It is with great concern that I learn of the sickness of the honorable one , " answered Stephen , tipping back in his swivel chair , conveying a subtle insult by his sprawling attitude . " Which is not escaping Liu , " he said to himself . And aloud , " I could not think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feasting . " " Ai , " responded Liu , with a deep sigh . " My miserable self is not to be considered . " Stephen felt his anger rising . He 'd puncture the man 's self-complacency . " Could the injury by any chance be in the honorable one 's leg ? " Eying Liu closely , he noticed a lessening of his composure . " He knows that I have seen through him , " thought Stephen , with no little satisfaction . " Once he told me himselfof Yuan Shih Kai 's excuse of a lame leg when the Prince Regent , who had forced him into retirement , summoned him to the palace to help put down the revolution . Yuan wished the prince to know he was strong enough to give the veiled insult . " Now Liu began sincerely to urge Stephen to feast with him . " I could not cause the great Liu trouble , " the white man insisted . The agent 's disdainful pride fell away . " Come , Prior Born , " he begged , " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . "  |p149Failing  to move Stephen by these entreaties , he went away . The next day emissaries came as go-betweens in the matter . After three days it was arranged . Stephen would go once with Liu to the restaurant , so that he might get back his face . But never after that . Afterward the proprieties were kept . Liu occasionally invitedthe Chases to a feast , and Stephen found some reason which made it impossible for them to go . And now Stephen and Hester had no one to break their isolation . Alone on the plain , for days hearing no Western voices other than their own , the mass thought engendered by the drop-by-drop suggestions emanating from the constantlyworking will of the Company , pervaded their minds . Their days came to be peopled with men and women , many of whom they had never met , employees of the Company scattered over China . For some they felt the hot flare of unreasoned enthusiasm , how engendered they never stopped to think ; for others equally unreasoned dislikes and suspicions . A little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person , spoken by Director Swaley , by this or that man in the Company , were remembered now . As they sat by the fire at night , the wind howling outside , Stephen spoke to Hester of his friend Kendall , recently transferredfrom Harbin to Vladivostock . " A coming man , " he told her . " I do n't see that he does anything more than you do , " Hester protested . " You 're too modest . " " I 'm a plodder , " answered Stephen . " Kendall is aggressive . You should see him , Hester . He 's great . " Through the agent a rumor reached Stephen that Jim was drinking too much . He did not say anything of this to Hester , but he thought a great deal about it . Jim had always taken too much , but he had never let it interfere with his work . Must be now , if the agent had heard about it.  | The snow fell as it had not fallen for years in Manchuria  --  particles that bit like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow , two or three days of bittercold , glittering quiet , the thermometer falling to twenty , to thirty below zero ; then another and another storm of wind and snow . Out of the storm , the tanks looming darkly . Between Stephen and Hester , shut away from the world , grew an exquisite dependence . Often Stephen left his work , throwing on his greatcoat to hurry through the cold passagewayconnecting office and house , that he might look at Hester sitting in a low chair , a work-basket by her side , her sewing dropped in her lap , for always she heard his footsteps and looked up to welcome him . It seemed to Stephen that her delicate spirit all but burned through the thin mask of her features , illumining them with incredible beauty . Through the long evenings they sat side by side on the couch , their fingers intertwined , exchanging intimate bits of their life in America , jealous of the years each had lived without the other . Stephen , especially , had a lively curiosity about every act of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endless questions about her father , the house they had lived in , the children she had played with . Hester told him everything with almost childlike frankness , except of the precious experience of her music ; of this she did not speak , and he came to believe that music had been only a small part of her life , not guessing that she was hiding something . Music was gone now . . . he was not a musician . . . these were the reasons for her secretiveness . And now at last Stephen 's satisfaction in Hester 's looks and bearing , his contentment in her companionship , flamed up into love . All night he held her in his arms , waking at her every movement , his senses afire as he adjusted his body to her comfort . Sometimes his lips caressed the thick masses of her hair , the now full curves of her breasts . He had not loved her when he married her , but that made no difference to Hester now . Only this ecstasy mattered . She lay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might know to the uttermost the strength of his vigorous body . Opening the door softly before he knocked in the morning , Kin would find them clasped in each other 's arms . He was well pleased . Now had his moment come . The missie would pay little attention . The mouths of his family would be well filled for a time . A new sense of privacy came to Hester and Stephen . All day the rumble of the long carts , passing unseen just outside the compound wall , gave them the excited pleasure of being in hiding together ; and at night , hearing in the still air the far-off whistle of the Siberian Express , they drew closer , the world forgotten and undesired . So the months slipped by , and Hester 's time of travail was not far away . In his heart Stephen felt that she should have more expert care than the Danish doctor , who had been here many years , could give her . But when he thought of parting from her , he felt maimed and helpless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , the world that now seemed abnormal to him in its activities , its dangers , disturbed him . " Hester , do you feel that you should go ? " " Oh , no , Stephen . No . I could n't , I could n't go alone . " She broke into frightened sobbing . " There , there , " he hushed her . " I could n't bear to have you go , but I thought maybe you 'd have better care . " In the morning they confessed they had been foolish . Nothing need take Hester away . The Danish doctor was good , and he was very kind . Once again Hester began to feel that she was in sanctuary , in the little house shut off from the world by the rumble of the long carts.  |p152THE  winter broke . One day it seemed unending ; the next , as they sat at lunch , they heard the drip of the melting snow from the eaves of the house . There was a knock at the door and Kin ushered Jim into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from ? " shouted Stephen , delighted . " Just asked the boss if I could take a run up to see you . " Stephen eyed his friend with pleasure , realizing how he had missed the comradeship of men . But Hester felt Jim 's comingan intrusion , jarring her chrysalis of delight . That night the two men sat talking together after Hester had gone to bed . Stephen could n't stop talking . So much to ask about . Good old Jim . He certainly looked fit enough . But , hang it all , he did n't want Jim to lose out now when the big chance was coming . " Say , " he blurted , " why do n't you cut the drink out ? With all this new organization coming on , you 'll get a big place if you do n't play the fool . " " Do I look any less fit than I ever have ? As for business  --  you know my work . " " Well , what 's all this talk drifting around ? I even hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold of the fellow that started it . " " Steady there , Steve . You 'll only hurt yourself with the Company , if you start defending me . And anyway it does n't matter , " Jim went on . " I 've decided to chuck the whole thing . That 's why I 'm up here really  --  to tell you . I 've had a little money left me . Not much , just enough to give me a start . " In the dusk of the next afternoon , as the two men were/leaving the office , Jim rested his hand on Stephen 's shoulder . " Say , old chap , you wo n't mind my mentioning it , will you ? Hester and you ought to get out of here . Somewhere , anywhere , just to have a change . As soon as the kid comes , you 'd better ask for a vacation . You two have been great . Stuck it out up here without any fuss . This new organization which seems to have got all you young fellows by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They might give you my place . " Stephen felt his heart leap . " You know there 's a rumor they 're going to move the offices to Mukden ? " Jim went on . " Bean trade all pulled away from our little diggings now , of course . With Dalny the coming port , Mukden will be the center of the province . " " That 'd break the old boss 's heart , would n't it ? " asked Stephen . " I do n't mind telling you , Steve , the boss is in a bad jam over that godown he rented the Company . Company seems to have got its back up about the lease . The talk is that he wished a lemon on them . " " But I always understood he did n't want to lease to them ? " " Exactly , but they seem to have got him tangled up . Hate to go off and leave him . Wish you were there . These young chaps harass him over new methods . You know the old boss  --  all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit , and you can keep the office as modern as it needs to be . And my word , he certainly knows how to increase business . Returns soaring ! " Jim broke off suddenly , changing the subject back to Stephen . " I 've got an idea . Suppose I stay and take charge of the business for a while , look after the tanks ? Two or three days , I mean . I 'll wire the boss . You and Hester take a run up to Harbin . Could n't ? On account of Hester ? How about going to my diggings ? Good doctor there . Train ride too much ? As soon as the kid comes , you do it . " After Jim 's visit , Stephen found it difficult to settle back into the monotonous slog , slog , the humdrum routine . Then the desire for initiative passed , as did the desire for companionship . He and Hester lived as before . The last vestige of old snow was gone . The windows stood open , hardly a cart passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plains again filtered into the house , the shrieking wind set the shutters rattling , the screens whining . But Hesterdid not notice . It was the hour in the afternoon when the tanks cast their shadows over the house . The day 's work was done and Stephen and Hester paced back and forth outside the compoundwall , on the path which hung like a shelf above the sunken rutted road . Hester felt her time was near , and Stephen hurried Kin off for the doctor . The sun sank . Gripped more and more by pain , she became fearful that the doctor would not arrive in time . " There he is , " cried Stephen . In the last faint light , he discerned the great Scandinavian plodding toward them . No one could mistake him , with his ill-fitting trousers flapping against his legs , his red beard , nearly to his waist , blowing in the wind . Often Stephen had met the doctor so , striding about on foot to save the expense of a cart , visiting the sick in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had labored without returning to his own country . Of peasant stock , vigorous in his strength and his remedies , Stephen once had questioned his ability . Now he felt only relief that into the doctor 's strong hands he could put the responsibility of Hester . " It is not for many hours yet , " said the doctor . Then he told how Kin had traced him through the city . " Very fine servant . What is his name ? " Hester was at a loss . " Why , Kin , that 's all I know . " The doctor frowned . " This iss not the way , Mrs. Chase . He has identified himself with your family . "  | " Now I shall ask a blessing from the dear Father , " he said , as they sat down to the dinner table . After dinner , they walked with the doctor about the compound , pausing for a moment at the gate , looking off over the plain . All at once Stephen realized that smoke was hangingover that part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was not the wraithlike smoke of the evening cooking fires . This smoke bellied up like a giant puff ball . Then a tongue of flame shot up into the air . " Kin ! " he shouted . The three men talked rapidly together in Chinese . Hester could only half make out what they were saying . " What does Kin say ? What does he say ? " she asked . Stephen , with an effort , pulled his mind back to give attention to her . " It 's a fire , Kin says , not very near the godowns yet , but the wind is in that direction . A lot of thatch roofs in there . If the fire reaches them , the godown is in danger ! " They looked into each other 's eyes . They were as one personwith no need of speech . Stephen must go . The oil was his responsibility . If anything should happen , and he was not there Now that they had decided , Stephen ran back into the house , reappearing almost instantly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for me , if .. . But the doctor says it wo n't be before morning . " Gently Stephen kissed her , but not once did he look back as he strode from the compound . Hester watched him , a slight figure , hurrying away . A fierce pain gripped her and she knew her hour had come . The iron gates clanged to behindhim , shutting him from her sight . Under the sharp necessity of gathering together her own forces to meet her travail , she felt a sudden sundering of her identity from Stephen 's . During the hours of the night , with their demands of struggle and pain , this separate identity grew more definite until she had lost all sense of relationship with him . She , alone , struggling to give birth to the life within her . When Stephen entered the city , the crowds of fleeing people he had met in the plain grew denser , congested in the narrow alleys . Suddenly Kin appeared . Stephen , so used to his presence , forgot he had told Kin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself into the mass , parting the crowds for his master . As they drew nearer the fire , smoke filled their lungs . Coughing , half-strangling , at last the two men came out by the compound , the gray godown roof just showing above the wall . The gates were fast barred . To their loud cries of " Open , Open , " there was no answer . For one moment Stephen was terrified . Had the keepers deserted ! Then something told him that he could rely on their loyalty . Kin had got hold of a great timber and together they drove it against the gate like a battering-ram . It made a loud boom and the iron gates shook under the impact . At last the voice of the agent himself cried , " Who is without ? " " Open , " commanded Kin , " the tai-pan . " A crack , and an eye at the crack . Then , as those inside the compound saw that Kin spoke truly , the gate opened wide enough to admit them . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the steep slant of the godown roof , clinging precariously as they drew up buckets of water . " They ca n't save the godown that way , " he thought . " Sparks are falling in showers at every puff of wind . " It was a good thing he had come . Now his anxiety over Hester , sharp within him as he crossed the plain , receded into the back of his mind , hanging there like a black curtain of apprehension . He saw immediately that the godown could be saved , if a space were cleared between the wall and the fire . Should he have it cleared ? If he did the Company must pay for all the huts he tore down . There was no time now for the long Oriental bargaining , and the house owners would have thep157Company at their mercy when the time came for the settlement . He would have to prove that he had not acted too hastily , or he would be censured for such an expenditure . A man 's initiative , Stephen knew from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited a little , took a chance on the wind changing , or dying down as it often did at night ? But suppose neither happened ? As he sifted his problem , it resolved itself into spending a relatively small amount of money , in order to obviate the risk of losing the oil and damagingthe city ; or into taking the larger risk in the hope of avoiding the expenditure . Also , if the oil took fire , the Company would incur the hate of the city . His mind seesawedback and forth unable to make any decision . As he stepped outside the gate to have a closer look at the fire , the flames leaped into a near-by street , consuming the thatched roofs as if they had been tinder , consuming Stephen'sindecision also . He felt a sudden exhilaration as he stood between the fire and the godown . For this night , he , Stephen Chase , was the Company ! He , the brain ! Choose and shoulder the consequences ! He ran into the street with Kin in front , crying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tai-pan promises the Keepers of Light will pay ! " At his heels followed the agent 's little band of faithful coolies . As the crowbars crunched into the heavy matted thatch , a low and ominous murmur , like the angry hum of many bees , came from the people . But Kin went among them sayingover and over , " The tai-pan makes himself responsible ! " and the angry sound changed to one of satisfaction . " The Keepers of Light Company is rich , rich enough to buy the whole city . The price shall be high , in order that we and our children may live . " Stephen was everywhere supervising his men , himself working . It was like destroying giant ant-hills . The dust of the falling thatch was in his mouth , his throat . Pouring forth from the huts , men , women , children , ants carrying their loads  --  pathetic possessions , a crude stool , a board with bits of rag pasted to it . At last the space between the godown and the fire was a heap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Stephen was aghast when Kin handed him a list of the huts destroyed , destroyed without the Company 's authorization . And then the fire , behaving like the demon the people conceived it to be , now that it had frightened Stephen into the destruction of the houses , retreated . The wind dropped suddenly and the flames began to die down . Weary to the point of exhaustion , Stephen 's elation over the acceptance of responsibility left him . The black curtain at the back of his brain suddenly moved forward . Suppose something had happened to Hester in his absence ? He was no longer a Company man , but an individual , who would have sacrificed any interest of his own , rather than leave Hester this night to face the birth of their child without him . Looking at his watch , he was startled to find it was past midnight . As quickly as he could , he made his way through the city , over the plain crowded now with those who had been made homeless , denied shelter until the evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his flash-light to avoid stumbling over them , seeing each for an instant , a succession of pictures , set in the glowing circle of his electric torch : , an old man sitting on his haunches , staring straight ahead of him ; a young man , knees drawn up under his chin , head on knees like some fantastic Oriental god , asleep ; a woman with matted black hair lying as an animal lies , making a half-circle of her body to shelter her young , a brown hand stretched out relaxed , inert , there on the trampled dirt of the plain under Stephen 's advancing foot . His tired brain did not retain the impression of a single face . Instead , as he strode along , hastening to Hester , only countless crouching forms resigned to their calamity . No lamentation , no complaining even before this visitation of great evil . These crouching acquiescent figures seemed top159cling around his feet , retarding his progress . But at last he was free , running now toward the compound wall and the corrugated iron gate , stumbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for breath , he came in through the door that led into the living-room , almost falling over Li Tsu who whined and licked at his boots . The coolie carrying a pail of hot water was coming in from the kitchen , " Tai-pan , tai-pan , " ( " Master , master , " ) he said in his soft voice , lookingpityingly at Stephen . Hardly noticing , he stumbled on into the bedroom . He saw the aznah leaning over Hester . He saw her pass a wet cloth over Hester 's face . He heard Hester 's moan . " Sweet , sweet , I 'm here . What is it ? " He was about to drop on his knees by her side when a voice , harsh and commanding , spoke . " Here , help me . Thank God , you 've come . " Hester lay with eyes closed , only the trembling of her lips giving any indication that she lived . Stephen moved reluctantlyto the foot of the bed where the baby lay . But the baby meant nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathe . Here , beat him like this . I must look after your wife . " As the doctor spoke , he placed a towel in Stephen 's hand . Mechanically , Stephen obeyed . Again the doctor commanded him , " Breathe into his lungs . " As Stephen felt the wafer-like lips against his own he suddenly realized that this tiny male creature was his son . He cried out in anguish , for the lips were cold and he could not force his breath between them . The doctor was shaking him , commanding him sternly to resign himself to the will of God , and to take the child away so that the mother should not know . " She must sleep , see , she yields now to the medicine . " Stephen , carrying the child , who had the semblance of cuddling to him with his hands drawn up on his chest , walked into the spare room and locked the door . Here he examined the beauty of his son , held the diminutive feet in his hand ,  |p160those  feet so like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fit to a shoe , and the hands , replicas of his own , square hands with short fingers , the kind of hands that like work . But the beautifully rounded chin , the sensitive mouth , Hester 's ; and the black hair , curiously abundant , lying in damp curls at the nape of the baby 's neck . With infinite care he bathed and dressed the child , taking from the drawer of the dresser the clothes Hester had made during the winter . He laid him on the cold white spread of the bed and walked from the room dazed , as if he had awakened in a strange land . Why was he here on this great plain with his dead baby ? In the midst of a people among whom he had not one friend  --  unless some stir within , longing for Hester , longing to let her comfort him , longing to comfort her . The assistant manager from Shanghai was sent up to give his opinion whether clearing the space had been necessary . The situation had become more serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had decided it would have nothing but tiled roofs . Stephen hardly heard what the man said . He had been over-cautious , according to the manager  --  might have waited a little longer . But what did he care , whether Shanghai liked what he had done , or not ? Maybe he 'd sacrificedhis baby to do it . Maybe his son would have lived , if he had been there to help earlier in the evening . He was sure Hester thought so . She was as coldly separated from him as if he were a stranger , taking no notice of him , sitting for hours without speaking , and at night she lay straight and rigid on the edge of the bed . All Stephen wanted was to get away . Now that it was too late to save the baby , he strained every energy to bring about a transfer , as if , somehow , it would straighten out the past . " It does n't do any good to be asking for transfers , " the as/sistant manager said , speaking in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was moved . Chase had n't told him , but he understood they had lost a child recently . " When 's your home leave due , Chase ? Overdue , is it ? Well , you fellows get kind of buried in these places . Suppose I put your home leave up to Shanghai ? " They had talked it over again in the droshky on the way to the train , Stephen trying desperately to exact a promise . It seemed to him the assistant manager was avoiding any definitestatement , as if , after all , he did n't want to take the responsibility of suggesting the matter of home leave in Shanghai . Hester was scarcely conscious that Stephen and the assistantmanager had gone out , even as she had scarcely realized their presence , preoccupied as she was with the dream-beset world where she had dwelt since the doctor had told her about the baby . In that dreaming state , she was happy . Her baby was not dead , but in the dark safety of her womb . Sitting in the same low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter , wearing the same dress , she sought to feel the fulness of her body , the precious dragging weight of her child . It troubled her now that it lay so still . Why was there no sudden thrust of life ? Her mind took shelter behind its fabrication , shielding itself . But reality could no longer be denied . The unfamiliar lightness of her body . There was no weight within her ! She stood up . Slowly she passed her hands down the length of her slim hips . Her untenanted body ! With restless indirection , she wandered from room to room , out to the veranda where the moonlight lay in metallic brilliance . Back into the house again . Her child 's tiny but tenacioushold of her loosened . Her husband  --  since the night of the fire she had been separated from him . Freedom . With swift and certain direction , she reached for her violin , thin ecstasy of life in and for herself possessing her . Ecstasy playing itself into frenzy , becoming disordered , stopping abruptly . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard her . He stood transfixed . Hester 's music , usually an unknownmedium to him , was not so to-night . It broke his heart . He went on to the house , rattling the door-knob to prepareher for his coming . She was again sitting in her low chair , listless and silent , as he had left her . All at once fear struck at his heart . This far north with its high winds , its stingingair pitching the most phlegmatic of white people to a high tension , had been known to drive women mad . What had he been thinking of to let Hester stay during the strain of her pregnancy ? He dared wait no longer . She must get away immediately , even if she had to go alone . " Hester , " he asked , " would you like to go home ? " " Yes , " she answered , and this time she did not cling to him . He was relieved at that , for she must go and he could not go with her . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arms , but she lay as far from him as possible . It took all Stephen 's fortitude to meet the days after Hester had gone . It was summer , and there was almost nothing to do in the office . No oil could be sent out over the roads made impassable by the rains ; little supervision of the agents and sub-agents was necessary ; the peasants did not buy the precious light at this season , saving their coppers for the long dark winter ahead . Stephen had received word that the question of his leave had been taken up with New York . Two months of days must intervene before he could expect to hear , two months of days filled with the idle occupation of guarding the tanks . He tried to keep his thoughts from Hester , but he could not . He worried about her on the long trip . She seemed so remote , would she be able to make friends , would her heart forget its trouble ? Her letters told him nothing . Hep163could not have believed that a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held herself apart from him , or was this kind of letter natural to her ? He could not say , for he had never received a letter from her before . The house seemed like the cage Hester had first called it , the routine of his days and nights confined within it . The dining-room : three meals to be got through each day with the empty expanse of table before him . The living-room : long noon hours , longer evenings , when everything brought to him the memory of Hester , and yet nothing conveyed association with her . When she went , she seemed completely to have taken herself out of his life . He wondered how she had managed to leave the house so bare of her presence , when once she had seemed to pervade every crevice of it . The bedroom : mechanically dressing and undressing ; lying for hours staring into the darkness , wondering how he and Hester , bound in a union so close , could in one night have become as strangers to each other . There was a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell asleep , Li Tsu curled between his shoulders . After a time , he walked the treadmill of his days numb to any deep feeling . Then his release came . A letter arrived granting him leave , and on the next morning 's train , appeared Walter Cheatham , to relieve him . Cheatham was the bearer of exciting news . The director had dropped down suddenly on China and was making drasticchanges in the organization . " A classy organization , I 'll tell you , " said Cheatham . " Some of the men are getting regular plums . Director does n't give much for this talk about learning the Chinese way of business . Teach the Chinese our ways . Modern business methods . No more of this pioneer stuff , either . Says he likes to have the men get married , so he has shortened the probationtime to two years . That means me in another year . Cute little house , cozy for two . But perhaps I 'll be promoted before then . " He strolled over to a mirror hanging betweenp164the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gettingready to go somewhere . " Any club around here ? " he asked . " No , " said Stephen . Cheatham sat down . " There 's to be a new manager in Shanghai , " he went on . " They say he 's fine . Different sort . . . college man , some one who can really represent the Company . Skinflint 's retiring on a jolly fine pension I guess , from all I hear . Wonderwhat the director will do to Manchuria when he gets here ? Stir it up , I 'll bet . "  |p165Two  days later , when Stephen reached the main office , already the stir had begun . The director had come in on the train from Tientsin only a few hours earlier . All the men had been called in from the sub-stations , and Kendall from Vladivostok , although it was an independent station . Stephen had understood the business in Vladivostok had been a kind of subrosa affair , in which his friend had had to pose as a free lance . " Wonder why Kendall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him , though . Have n't set eyes on him since that day in New York when we were green classmen . Neater , trimmer than he used to be . Has a confident air of having succeeded . " But he had only a few moments to talk with Kendall , for almost immediately he was called into conference with the director who had turned the outer room into a private office for himself . He began questioning Stephen about the fire . In the eyes of the Company , Stephen saw it was simply a matter of proving whether or not he had acted hastily ; it was n't a question of Hester and the baby , that was the personalside which did not enter into it . Strange , he thought , the old boss is n't called in . He 'd have backed me up . But there was n't much time to think about it  --  he must make good on his own if that something big the director talked about a year ago was to come through . After the conference , he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come in , " called the familiar gruff voice in response to his knock . " I 'm here to report , sir , " said Stephen , a little discomfited however that his superior officer had been sitting here , while he himself had been discussing with the director business pertainingto the boss 's territory.  | " Well , " said the boss , " it does n't seem to count around here what I think , but I 'll tell you anyway  --  here 's congratulationsover the way you handled that fire . As a matter of fact , you 've done damn well on the whole winter 's busi-ness . " " Thank you , sir , " said Stephen . " It means a lot to me to know I 've satisfied you . " " Humph , " said the boss . " It wo n't help you much . But I hope you get something good out of all this new scheme . If I had any say , you would . " After a moment he spoke again , " Sorry about the wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're young . Lots of time yet for a family . " At the club a little later the director , no longer the ruthlessinquisitor of the afternoon , chatted with Stephen in a fine spirit of comradeship . Stephen felt a surge of excitement , evidently he had come through all right in his explanation of the fire . When the director asked about Hester , in a burst of confidence , he spoke of his anxiety . " The doctor said she could n't live in this climate any longer and I had to send her home ahead of me , " said Stephen . " I am sorry , " said Swaley . " Nice woman , your wife . We had thought  --  well , there are going to be some good opportunities in Manchuria . You seem to understand this exchange . Probably ( this is , of course , confidential ) we 're going to bring in some one here who understands the new organization . He 'll need a strong right hand . You do n't think if you put it up to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person and interested in your career  --  you do n't think she 'd feel she could meet it for your sake ? " " It is n't a question of her willingness , " Stephen spoke eagerly , anxious to justify Hester . " It 's her health . " Swaley tried to fathom Chase . If it was really his wife 's health that held him back , he could not afford to force his demands . Chase was too valuable for that . At the time of the fire , he had shown admirable balance between cautionp167and decision . But if the real reason for his hesitation was his friendship for this backwoods manager , why that was a different matter . It was annoying , the way that old fellow made the men loyal to him . That man who had left the Company , Jim something or other . It seemed he had insisted that " the boss , " as he absurdly called him , had been straight in this godown business . Director Swaley felt hot under the collar as he thought of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company the right and wrong of a thing . Good idea , his chucking his job , saved a lot of trouble getting rid of him . He 'd have no nonsense from Chase , either . If he was squeamish about being put over the old codger he called friend , he should be made to take the job , sick wife or not . But as he looked at Stephen 's sensitive face , he decided it would be better not to force the issue . " I do n't want to buck him now , do n't want to lose him . Better maneuver a little . " The next day Kendall joined Stephen as he left the office . " Wanted a little talk with you , Steve , " he said . " Keep this under your hat , but I 'm to be manager when the office goes to Mukden . Of course , I do n't know whether I could get it through , but how about being my number two ? " Stephen looked at him sharply . Kendall was n't speaking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't he say anything about my wife 's health ? " he asked , disgusted to think Swaley would sacrifice Hester if she would consent . He added , " If I stay with the Company , it 's got to be somewhere else than in Manchuria . " Kendall was secretly more desirous of him than ever . Steve was keen , just the man he wanted . " And he knows Manchuriabetter than I do . I 'll need his knowledge . " Aloud he said , " Better think it over . It does n't pay to turn the Companydown on a proposition . " As Kendall urged him , there flowed into Stephen 's mind the knowledge that he was valuable to the Company , andp168that he had handled the fire business to their satisfaction . But what about the man who had trained him ? If Kendallwas to be manager , they must mean to retire the boss . It was two years before his time , to be sure , but two years ' extra pension would mean nothing to so rich a Company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if he had read Stephen'sthoughts , " is to be sub-manager here in town . " He said it abruptly , glancing at Stephen to see his reaction . There was none . Well , Steve knew how to keep his own counsel . He wanted him more than ever . " The Company could n't move him , for he says he would n't live anywhere else but here , " Kendall added . " Is that their justification ? " Stephen spoke coldly , thinkingwith distaste of the way the boss 's words had been turned to suit the purpose of the Company . Now he remembered the boss on his fiftieth birthday , receiving the homage of the agents . Think of him , sub-station manager here where he had been so honored , all these agents witnessing his demotion ! It was such loss of face , he mused to himself , as would wreck a man before the Chinese . Stephen felt disgust for the Company , that it should bring such humiliation on any of its men , and on the boss of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll come back , " he said to Kendall . That night , the last night of his stay in the town , Stephen had dinner with the boss . Until then he had felt for him nothing except sympathy and the greatest respect but , before the evening was over , he began to wonder if he had overvaluedthis garrulous old man . He had remembered the boss as reserved , but here he was divulging all sorts of personal matters in an effort to explain the godown affair . And then he boasted that he would n't give the Company the satisfactionit would get if he resigned . " That 's what they 're trying to force me to do , " he said . " But they 'll pay my pension . I 'll show them they ca n't get the best of me like that . " Try as he would , Stephen felt reaction in favor of thep169Company , and a withdrawal of his spirit from this bragging old man  --  for old , the boss suddenly seemed . Still he could not have stood it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was impossible for him to come back to Manchuria . The train was pulling out from the town that for five years had been the center of Stephen 's interests . In a few hours now Manchuria would be for him a thing of the past . He knew that he would be given something good in another part of China if he wished it ; and he had kept his man 's right to choose where he should go , and he had not allowed them to put him over the boss . Hang it all ! Why had n't the boss kept step with the Company ? The town had faded into the plain ; now the lights of the express blotted out the plain . Five years , and yet no single relationship with this country remained . Kin had decided not to come back to him if he returned to China . Even Li Tsu was no longer his . He had given the little dog to Kin.  |p170As  THE steamer sailed out of the harbor at Yokohama the steady strong vibration of machinery that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice , now excited him incredibly . When he went below for dinner and saw fresh green things to eat , he felt like a boy in a fairy tale sitting down to a banquet brought by rubbing Aladdin 's lamp . The starved cells of his body cried out for this green food after the monotonous diet of the winter plains , and he ate ravenously , wolfing the celery and the lettuce . Then , suddenly conscious of the others at the table , tourists , he felt humiliated that the poverty of his exile had betrayed him into this greedy hunger . He found himself talking , the starved cells of his mind crying out for companionship . Then , suddenly conscious , he retreated into stiff silence . He seemed never able to be casual . But bit by bit , as Western civilization took shape before him , he accommodated himself to it , although many of the ways of his own people were still strange to him when the ship drew into San Francisco three weeks later . All the long journey across the continent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , into which for five years he had been trying to fit himself , in order that he might change it . The train pulled into the terminal at New York , its networkof tracks stretching away on every side , not just one thin track as in the stations of Manchuria . He was the first on the platform , the first hurrying toward the exit . Beyond the iron grill of the gate stood Hester . Was it only her modish apparel that was different ? Was she still the aloof gray Hester of their last days together ? The great station vaulted above them . Sunshine fell inp171a pattern over the marble floor . As in a trance Stephen felt himself , Hester clinging to his arm , caught up into the stream of well-dressed men and women , moving forward toward the entrance . He was fascinated with the sound of many feet , with the silken swish of the swinging door as they passed through to the street . In sudden assault , the triumphant roar of the city burst upon his ears , and without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plains of Manchuria , the stark little house at the mercy of the sun and the wind and the dust , the hovering tanks , even the small grave in the corner of the doctor 's compound , were gone . In this city of power , of exultant prosperity , only the impression of his success remained . Glamourous , it waited for him . Until now he had been uncertain whether he should return . Then at last they were in their room at the hotel , and he was clasping Hester in a long embrace , trying to bind himself into that intimacy so suddenly snapped the night of their mutual grief . But Hester broke the embrace . " Your mother is very frail , " she said . " You 'll see when you get home . " He did see . His mother old and delicate , constantly importuninghim to remain in America . Hester , still not wholly recovered , silently waging the same battle . He felt himself intimidated by their imperious frailty . " It is n't just that I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do stay here , how shall I take care of them ? Mother 's extravagant , and Hester 's used now to the ease of the rich . Kin and arnah have taken care of her so long , she 's forgotten how much you have to do for yourself in America . " He would have to start in at the bottom here . When he had said to one or two old friends that he was thinking of staying at home , immediately he had lost standing with them . They discounted the value of his foreign experience , so far as business in America was concerned ; made him feel that he would be at a disadvantage starting in now . But when he mentioned his position abroad , then he had prestige among them . " You 're lucky , Steve , " they said . " Look how we slave . " And then , when in his pleasure in their companionship , he forgot and began to tell them in detail of his experiences they grew impatient , wanting to get back to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . It made him crave the dignity his own work gave him . In that lack of integral participation in his country , a sudden nostalgia for the East swept him . He remembered an early morning , with the sun rising over the kaoliang , and his own shadow as he had seen it , fabulous and enormous in the golden light , silhouetted on a harvested field . In remembrance he felt big with importance , having Manchuria as his background . He loved Manchuria , but that at least must be given up for Hester . On their return to New York , Mr. Swaley asked to see Stephen 's wife . Passing through the door of the great buildingHester whispered : " I feel so small . As if nothing that happened to us could be of any real importance ; the way you 'd feel  --  well  --  if you jumped into Niagara . " Stephen hardly noticed what she was saying , wondering why the director had asked him to bring Hester . To come into the director 's office was like being taken up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world spread out at their feet . " See , " said Mr. Swaley , leading Hester to the window , " the sun 's going down , but it never sets on our business . Well , now , over in China , " there was a flourish of his white manicured hands , " why , there 's the sun and our business . " There was also a flourish in his voice . " Does n't it stir your patriotism , Mrs. Chase , America 's economic empire ? A rich empire . New citizenship of the world . Fine , is n't it ? " he added . Stephen , standing at the next window with the instructor , who had given him his first lessons in foreign trade , thrilled to the words . But Hester stared intently at the city .   " I was trying to locate the opera-house , " she said finally . " You ca n't tell me where it is , can you , Mr. Swaley ? " " Well , no , I ca n't . " Confound her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Look , " he said , " there 's the last of the sun . Do n't you like to think it 's rising now over your little home in Man-churia ? " He heard the sharp intake of Hester 's breath . When he looked at her , her mouth was set in a studied smile . Proudly , it seemed , she tried to conceal the anguish which her eyes betrayed . " Umph . " So this is why Chase has been dodging a final commitment to return . Manchuria will have to be given up , if we get him . A lot of fuss over a still-born baby . Heard she was a musician . They 're an emotional lot . He drew closer now , a note of appreciation in his voice . " Mrs. Chase , we are not ignorant of the part you 've played in your husband 's work . We 're not forgetting it . Your kind of woman would never wreck her husband 's career . And Chase has a great opportunity . He 's considered one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you where you are to be stationed when you go back , but it 's against the policy of the Company . You see we have to be something like a standing army , each one ready to sacrifice for the good of the whole . However I promise you one thing , Mrs. Chase , " his voice carried a delicate note of sympathy , " I will personally guarantee that you wo n't be sent to Manchuria . That , we would n't ask of you . It 's lovely in southernChina , Mrs. Chase . " Stephen , trying to catch the drift of their conversation , felt a warm glow . How kind the director was . He was actuallyasking Hester where , if she could choose , she would most like to live in China . But suppose she should refuse right here to go back ? What a relief that , before Hester could speak , Director Swaley should remember his wife 's message . " Why , I nearly forgot , Mrs. Chase , " he said suddenly .   " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had . She told me to be sure and remember her to you . She 's so sorry that she is sailing to-morrow for Europe , for she wanted to see you . " Then the interview was over , and Hester and Stephen found themselves passing out through the door of Director Swaley 's office . " Well , what do you say ? " Stephen began eagerly the minutethey were out of ear-shot . " You know , Hester , I 've looked around a bit and it would n't be easy to start here at home . Five years out of my profession . Not much chance of getting in again there . Business abroad does n't count here as experience , they all say . " He went on , " The day the director took me out to lunch , some of the men were talking about the fellows who had left the Company . It seems the director likes to keep track of them . Hardly a one of them doing as well as if he had stayed with the Company . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance . It would be a great relief to me . I 've never told you , but I have n't any insurance , it costs so much out there . And of course we 'll get a pension if we stick . Seems a pity to throw it all away . All we went through , gone for nothing , just as we 're making good . " Hester could hardly think , Stephen talked so much , the directorhad talked so much . Until now her course had been crystal clear to her . In all the days since the baby 's death , Stephen 's happiness had not concerned her ; her separateness remained through the long weeks in the hospital on her return to America , and through the period of convalescence when she had lived only in music , submerging herself in the beauty of sound . Remote and hostile were her husband 's interests . But now as he pleaded with her , the intention of following her own desires was gone . If she opposed Stephen , he might stop loving her . Once more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her necessity . P175Stephen walked at her side , anxiously watching her face for some sign of encouragement . But she had turned away from him . Suddenly she stepped eagerly forward . " Hester , the traffic ! Remember you are on Fifth Avenue . " He drew her back . The lights changed . Hester plunged forward again , he following , dragged along in her impetuous progress . " I wo n't stop you , Stephen , just as you are making good . " He had an actual physical sensation of release as if a rope at which he strained had given away . Freedom to follow his career , unhampered . An inflooding of love claimed him  --  and trust . Sometimes , since his return , he had suspected that Hester was using her frailty unfairly to coerce him . He had wronged her . He felt remorseful and tender and gay . " Let 's take a bus , " he cried , " and ride all night . " Although it was not morning , it was late when they came back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arm around Hester as the bus rocked and tipped , plunging along the lighted way . Hester felt the old bliss and safety in resting against him . Mysterious union was again hers . It did not matter at this moment , even if the physician 's darkest prophecycame true and she had no other children . Or even that she must be deprived of music . " Hester , " said Stephen , breaking his difficult reserve , " it 's my work really , why I want to go back , not the other things I said . There is n't anything very heroic about business . Yet sometimes I feel it 's the stone the builders rejected . It stands at the head of the corner of so many things  --  at least in China . Like the little lamps the Company sells that I thought of . " " They ought to have put your name on the bottom of the lamps , like a Chinese chop , " said Hester . " Well , no , " answered her husband , " not in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . But sometimes , " he added , a little shyly , " it gives me an awful kick to know I thought of them . I ca n't quite explain , but once I cameP176into town at night and saw a little girl walking down a dark street carrying one of the lamps . And , well , I do n't know  --  it made me feel useful and  --  I like to keep on introducing them . " The next morning Stephen felt invulnerable , and of importance in the scheme of things until his return to the office , where he did n't seem to be half so important as he had been the afternoon before . Swaley took most casually his going back , as if he had known it all the time . " We 're sending you to the Central China district . Let 's see . The date of your sailing . . . your three months at home are up on the tenth . Ah , there are two ships sailing around that time from San Francisco . One the first , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get you to China , let 's see , about the beginning of April . That suit you all right ? When you reach Shanghai , they 'll tell you where you 're to be stationed . " P177IT WAS spring when Hester and Stephen first came to the rich valley of the Yangtse  --  China 's storehouse of food . " Oh , look ! It 's like walking in green pastures beside still waters , " cried Hester , as they sat on the deck of the comfortableBritish steamer which was taking them part-way up the great river to their station . " Such , quiet ! I did n't know a landscape could be so quiet . " Fascinated , she gazed out over the valley which , after thousands of years of cultivation , had lost all the wildness of nature and become man 's intimatedwelling-place . Level as a floor , it lay under its bright green carpet of rice , patterned into squares by the straight lines of the dike paths bordering the paddies . Gnarled and stunted mulberry trees and lacy bamboos stood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clipped to even smoothness hemmed it in . Crossing the flat surface , long still canals  --  water without movement lying between flat even banks . Hester touched Stephen 's arm . " Stephen , I feel that if we move , we 'll shatter it . It looks as if the earth had been brought to its fulfillment . Everything is perfected . There is n't a weed , as far as you can see . There is n't an inch of land that does not seem to have some purpose . Does it make you feel that way , Stephen ? " " A little , " answered Stephen , " since you speak of it , or perhapsbecause I know how full the valley is of people . They say two hundred millions live in what 's called The Valley  --  more than in all America . It makes me feel if you put another person into it , it would be like throwing a monkey-wrench into a machine . " " But they do , all the time , do n't they ? " asked Hester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their obsession.  | " The new manager 's good , is n't he ? " he added , abruptly changing the subject . " Not much like old Skinflint . The men call him The Gentleman . ' He told me the reason they are giving me this particular station is because the territory is all run down . They expect me to build it up  --  make the people buy oil . It 's a compliment . " " Yes , and I 'm proud of you . " " Well , hello there ! So this is where you are , tucked up into a corner by yourselves . " " Join us , Look , " said Stephen to the stout man who had addressed them . " Could n't do that , " Look replied . " I 'm for having a little get together of all of us before I leave . Coming to my stationpretty soon now . We 're all in the smoking-room . Come along . " Seems like old times to see you around , Steve , " he went on as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a good idea . This new scheme to get the managers together once a year , is n't it ? Improve the spirit among us all right , all right . Too bad you did n't get in in time for the conference . What time did you two get aboard last night ? Did n't see you . I was out on a party . Pretty late myself . " They had come to the door of the smoking-room and Stephen had not yet found an opportunity to speak . " Suppose you two have n't met them all , have you ? " said Look . " Girls and boys , meet Steve Chase and his wife . And you two  --  this is the Yangtse bunch . This is Mrs. Look . Here 's Burnham and his new bride . Brave man , Burnham , taking a girl to Chungking . Hawley 's boats only run in the summer . Never expected an old-timer like Burnham to do a thing like that . May happen to any one now . Over there in the corner are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and the three little Chestertons . Those fellows at that table drinking at this hour of the morning are the bachelors . The rest of you can introduce yourselves.  |p179Steve  , here , and I are the new ones . We ought to be seen not heard , but I 'm not that kind . " Stephen was silent , feeling more and more the honor of being a manager . The rest were all men much older in the Company . He , Look and Kendall , the only younger men who had main stations . For a moment he thought of Kendallstarting this morning for Manchuria . " Listen to them , " said Mrs. Chesterton , pointing to the men , " they are already talking business . " " We 've got to get after those interior points , " Hester heard Chesterton say . " Look at the richness of this valley . Biggestpotential market in the world . That was the whole tone of the conference . " " You 'd think they 'd get your husband or Joe Burnham to tell them about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hester . " But they 're all the same . They eat , sleep with the business . Perhaps it 's natural , " she added thoughtfully . " The Company keeps them on their toes every min-ute . " Hester looked at these men , known to her only by reputation . Chesterton seemed to fit his part  --  sound , cautious , conscientious . Look , she had thought of as a gay human kind of person . Instead he seemed to her merely noisy . Burnham  --  she was n't altogether certain what she thought of him , but she knew she liked his wife . Suddenly it struck Hester that most of these men were married and doing well with the Company . Always before she had felt that Stephen was a little handicapped because of her . A sweet sense of belonging to this group filled her . She had her place ! As the women chatted together , she began to realize that Stephen 's position endowed her with honor . She was a bit of a personage in the Company  --  a manager 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Look . " I 'll have to get our things together . " Every one rose now , going out to the deck.  |p18o  " I always think this valley looks like the Garden of the Lord , " said Mrs. Chesterton . " Just look at it  --  as if no one could ever want . " As she spoke the steamer turned down-stream , making its dock . Stepping between Hester and Elsie Burnham , taking an arm of each , Chesterton said , " Come along , I want to show you something I 'll bet you 've never seen . " He hurried them to the deck below . " Look at the crowd over there on the landing , " cried Elsie Burnham . Clinging to every stanchion , hanging to every available beam and cross-beam , and to the railings of the covered pontoon , were men . " It 's like a forest of monkeys , " she added . " What does it mean ? " " Carrying coolies after a few coppers , " explained Chesterton . " Better stand back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water was still swirling between the pontoon and the ship , when figures shot out from the clinging , struggling , human mass , hurtling through the air , catching at the deck railing , dropping on the deck . Up on their feet in a minute , struggling with one another , snatching at the passengers ' luggage . " Ai yah , " a woman screamed . " Ease her off a bit , " came the voice of an officer . " A confoundedcoolie 's missed his jump . " " Here , take that , you brute , " some one called out . A Chinese soldier raised the butt of his gun and hit a man who tried to yank a bundle from him . The half-naked yellow men crowded around Hester and Elsie . Elsie gave a little scream . Hester stifled one . " Here , let 's make the stairs  --  get on the top deck again , " said Chesterton . " Just wanted you to see it . " " What does it mean ? " persisted Elsie , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surplus of the valley , " said Chesterton , drawingp181them into a group of their own people , Look 's assistants and their wives who had come aboard to greet them . " The boat 's stopping an hour , " said a young woman , whose clothes Hester recognized were as much out of style as those she had worn before she went to America . " Do show us what you brought from home . I 've brought the local tailor , so he can copy your things . " The women were sitting on the couch and the bed in Nester'scabin when a Chinese in a soiled silk gown opened the door and walked in . " Tailor , you b'long listen at door , " the girl accused him . " No b'long , missie . Always b'long look see key-hole . S'pose all right . Enter ! " " Oh , what a pet ! " she cried as Hester took from her steamer trunk an afternoon dress she had bought in New York . " May I try it on ? " Grasping the dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given her consent . " Why , she 's pretty ! " thought Elsie Burnham . " I had n't realized it before , she looked such a frump in those dreadful clothes . Poor thing ! " She rushed away , returning with an armful of her own dresses . " There , " she cried , dumping them into the young woman 's lap . " I 'm your size . Put these on . " The girl 's cheeks flushed . She tried on one after the other , getting more excited , thrusting the tailor out into the passage while she changed , then back again to study another gown . " Now , look see , tailor . Can do ? " " I savee , missie . B'long number one tailor . " He took a dirty fashion-plate from a bundle . " Have got this side , all same . " Let me see , " said Mrs. Chesterton skeptically . " It 's a year old , " she said to him . " You must n't make them like that ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in unison . " I do ploper , " responded the little man , undismayed by the feminine reproach.  | " He 'll never get them right ! " The girl 's eyes were wistfulas she surveyed herself in a clinging chiffon . " What would n't I give to get into a shop again ! " She slowly let the dress slip to the floor . Elsie Burnham stood silent for a moment . Then she thrust the coveted dress into the girl 's arms . " Tell you what you do , " she said impulsively . " Take it along with you , then he 'll get it right . When you 're through , you can send it to me . " " Really ? " The girl gave a delighted squeal . " Well , I should n't , but I 'm going to . Wait until you 've been in the interior for a while and you 'll have no conscience about such things . But I promise I 'll get it to you before there 's any chance of summer floods , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Come , girls , the steamer 's leaving , " called Look from the deck . " We 've got to get off . " An hour later , as they steamed through the smiling valley , Elsie Burnham and Hester paced the deck together . " Tell me honestly , " said Elsie , slipping her arm through Hester 's , " shall I be all right up there ? I think I 'm going to have a baby . I have n't told Joe . I 'm sure he would n't take me with him , if he knew . He does n't think a woman can stand things , but I can . Though there 's the baby to think of . " Hester squeezed her hand , for a moment unable to speak . It was too sudden  --  this old ache of her breasts , her arms . Afterward she reproached herself . She had told the girl that she would be all right , that there would be a mission doctor there . Did it mean that if she had it to do over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surely not . Farther and farther , into the very heart of the green valley , the steamer took them , at every big city , their group grew smaller , as this and that one went away to his station . At last Stephen and Hester were alone . At Hankow they hadp183changed to a smaller steamer which went up the branch of the Great River to the city that was to be their station . Deeper , deeper into the heart of China they went . At the end of the second day , to the left of them , standing on ground built high above the green sea of rice , they saw in the fading light the shadowy forms of oil tanks . Stephen could not hide his excitement  --  four tanks giving mute but eloquent testimony to the great business of which he was to take charge . His was a vast domain . Now at last , a disciplinedmature man nearing thirty , he had his own territory , could use his pent-up power of initiative . Nearer came the steamer . A pontoon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tankers , now lay useless on a sand-spit . Under a bridge connecting the sand-spit with a gate in the wall surrounding the tanks , ran a tiny arm of the river . Like a moat and drawbridge they appeared , enhancing the look of strength of this fortress of big business . Hester drew close to Stephen . " Stephen , are n't you glad we do n't have to live there ? " she asked , pointing to the house under the shadow of the tanks . " Well , I 'm responsible for them just the same , " he answered . Darkness came quickly , like a pall let down from the gray sky . Drawing nearer , on a level with their eyes , was the low-lying dim gleam of the capital city of the province . The steamer swung round , making dock . Out of the shadows of the lighted pontoon , like bats suddenly disturbed , shot the flying forms of the coolies to the bright decks of the steamer . " Keep close to me , Hester , so the coolies ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gangplank , he noticed in the medley a northerner , bigger of build than these southerners  --  a little dog in his arms . Why , it was Li Tsu ! It was Kin ! Kin thrust the dog into his arms and Li Tsu barked , almost shaking himself out of Stephen 's hold in his eagerness to lick his master 's face.  | For a moment the crowd stopped its jostling . " Ai yah , they cried . Why had Kin come back ? He had said he would not . What had struck the old fellow ? Was it " friend pidgin " ? Suddenly it occurred to Stephen as strange that Kin should have known where to find him . " How did you know you would find me here ? " he asked . " Two moons I have known , " answered Kin . The grapevine telegraph , of course , Stephen said to himself . But two moons  --  two months ? Then , the Company had known before he left New York that he was to come here . Swaley had deliberately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , the tap on the shoulder , reminding him that , managership or no managership , he had no will of his own in the Company . They had stepped from the gangplank now and two young men came toward them . " I 'm Boynton , " said the older of the two . He turned to his companion , " And this is Fenton . " These then were his assistants . He had power over these men , even as the boss had had power over him . The thought eased Stephen of his resentment over Swaley 's withholding from him his destination , treating him as if he were a bit of inanimate Company equipment without will or individual needs . " Hope you do n't mind a Chinese city , " said Fenton , taking Hester 's arm . " We 've only got to go through a couple of streets . The hong is right on the edge . Not quite used to it myself . Just out from home . " " I 'm an old hand , " Hester assured him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Stephen . Familiar only with the cities spread out on the great plain , with their wide dusty streets , he had not conceived of a city so close pressed with humanity . Single file , the four went through the narrowalleys , the huts so near on either side that the white people felt themselves walking in a corridor between two lines of stalls which spilled their crowded life into the pas/sageway . The air hardly seemed air , so laden was it with ancient odors , never quite blown away . Over candles , over chimneyless lamps , over lamps with chimneys , men leaned , stitching shoes , stitching clothes , weaving mats , weaving cloth . Women helped , or sat in low chairs in the debris of the work , or on the edge of the street , babies at their breasts . Children pushing the babies away , pulling at the breasts , children everywhere like flotsam cast up by the feet of men . Men toiling like animals , carrying heavy loads , carrying men in chairs , trotting between shafts . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Fenton spoke to Stephen . " Look at that lamp of ours on that fruit vender 's stand ! Could n't be more Western , could it ? And yet it looks Easternhere , does n't it ? " Stephen glanced at the lamp burning dimly like a candle , the wick crusted over so that it flamed only at one point . It was Eastern . The boy straight from home was right . How strange to him , its creator , to whom it had always been an instrumentwherewith to alter the East . Of course , all the lamp needed was cleaning , but Fenton 's fancy stuck in his mind . Some one from inside unbarred the gate , and they filed into the compound . Across a hard-packed , clean-swept space of earth stood the hong  --  the House of Business . " What a curious building , " exclaimed Hester . " Yes , " said Boynton cheerfully . " It 's a Chinaman 's conception of a foreign house . It turned out a hybrid . His whole idea seemed to have been height @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rooms from the four sides of a court one on top of the other , called it a foreign hong , and we rented it . The Narrow House ' I believe the Chinese call it. , , From where they stood the length of the hong was enhanced , its width narrowed . Lights shone from the windows , showing the galleries encircling every floor , stairs ascending from gallery to gallery . They entered the hall that ran the length of the building . It , like the galleries , had stairs leadingstraight up to the next story . Down them now came the outgoing manager , Jenkins . " At your service , " he said laconically to Stephen . " Your office , " and he led them into a room on the right of the hall , then out again and up the bare stairway . The sound of their steps echoed and reechoed in the great building . " Junior apartments here , " he went on , as they reached the long hall on the second floor . " Fenton 's at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole top floor . I 'm staying with Fenton until I turn over the business to you . Now you know it all , " he ended with bored indifference . " Thanks a lot , " said Stephen . " Do n't bother to come up . Kin here seems to know the way . Good night . " " There 's a party going on over at the consulate , " Boynton called after them , " in honor of Jenkins . You 're invited . It 's just next door . " " Give us ten minutes , " Hester answered , leaning over the banister , seeing his upturned face . How strangely intimateit seemed ; these men so near , all of them in the same house , with their work and their personal desires . She supposedshe was still held in the grip of that isolation of the house on the plain . Hand in hand , Stephen and Hester made a quick tour through the high narrow rooms in their apartment . Oddly familiar , the chairs and the tables , identical in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their first home , identical with those in the house on the plain , their second home . Big and unwieldly in those houses ; small and shrunken in these high-ceilinged rooms . From the living-room windows at the narrow end of the house , they looked into the lighted windows of the consulate . Across the space between came white voices singing . " Listen ! There are n't many women here , are there ? " " How do you know ? "  | " Do n't you hear how the men 's voices predominate ? " " Well , maybe so , " Stephen answered , moving about the room , humming like an unmusical bumblebee in his contentment . Hester wandered from window to window , looking down on the city which hemmed them in at the back , crossing the room , looking down on the river filled with junks which hemmed them in at the front . " It 's like two cities and they creep right up to us . Stephen , what 's that ? That hollow beat , beat ? I 've never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her side . " Have n't you ? It 's a part of every Chinese city . But , of course , you 've never lived in one . It 's men beating out paper money for the dead . Often they work all night . " " In a city like this , I should think there would be no money for the dead unless they robbed the living . " The crowd was still singing when they entered the diningroomof the consulate . As the house-boy swung the door wide , ushering them within , with one accord the thirty-odd people seated around the table jumped to their feet , raised their glasses , singing : " For he 's a jolly good fellow , for he 's a jolly good fellow ! " " Who 's a jolly good fellow ? " some one shouted into the din . It was Fenton , flushed with wine , evidently thinking he was the cheer leader at a college football game . With a sweepingmovement of his hands , he led them into a cheer : " Chase , Chase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiously . Had those years apart crippled his spirit , making it impossible for him to be one with a crowd ? Had they crippled her too ? Oh , no , she would not have it so . They all began singing , " Mrs. Chase is a jolly good fellow ! " Again that sensation she had had on the steamer as she sat among the wives of the managers . She was important , she had her place . The commotion subsided and Hester was seated at the right hand of the host . How nice to be a member of a community once more . How nice they all looked.  |p189AT  THE first glimmer of daylight men and boys moved over the valley floor . Not a moment could be wasted , if three crops were to be harvested in the year . A few weeks ago , these men and boys had stood in the black ooze of the paddies , transplanting each blade of rice from the seed-beds . Forty , fifty days thus saved . Now kneeling in the slush of the flooded paddies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and girls who had carried in the warm restingplaceof their bosoms the eggs of the silkworms , now that they were hatched laid them on trays , and went into the gloom of the mulberry groves , gathering leaves to feed them . Others went to the narrow valleys which lay like long rooms between the mountains , picking the tender new leaves of the tea shrubs . Painstaking and slow was the labor . Each green tea shoot carefully detached , adding its minute trifle to the tons of tea needed . The toil of the city began  --  a city of no beasts or machines . In all the valley floor , only a few animals remained , animals needed for plowing the fields . In the cities there were no beasts of burden  --  beasts of burden eat too much ; grass is needed for the fires of men , grain for his food . Even then there is not enough . This morning from thousands of huts , the men poured . Long lines of them , poles across their shoulders , buckets suspended from the poles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city . Conserved in vats the night-soil , later to be used to fit the land for its excessive fruition , in order that it be not exhausted in this , the fortieth century of its use . Out toward the river , then back into the city , movedp190another long line of men carrying water . Water is precious , portion it out meagerly . Be not guilty of the sin of using too much . Otherwise , after death penance must be done . The woman who washes her clothes , tipping her tub so that a little water suffices , attains merit . Only the barbarians are wasteful of it . Even those who talk the Western religion , are guilty in the matter . Ai yah , they say they are not rich , but how shall we believe them ? They wash their clothes before they are soiled , wasting water ! Ai yah ! Wash their bodies every day , wasting water ! Sixty carries of water daily to the poorest of them ! Poor ! In the water-shops men thrust a few twigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers began trickling in . Two cash ' worth of boiling water to fill the teapot , a cash for a steaming cloth to wipe the face . In the tea-shops , too , customers were appearing , many buying bowls of hot water , with a few tea-leaves , others only the hot water . The early morning sun touched the Narrow House , making it glow like a long bar of silver . Charged like a magnet it was for all the city  --  charged with buying power . It was important news that a new master had come to it last night . The going away master had not the dauli . Was this new and fabulously rich master a keeper of custom ? A coolie from the near-by chair hong stopped at the shop of the seller of hot water . He snuffed out his cigarette , placingthe butt behind his ear for future use . " I bring a little news . I have talked with his servant . For five years he has served him . He says he is gentle . " Stephen was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only slow and languid as the East , itself , the notes slippingone into the other , slurring , blurring . It seemed to have gone on for a very long time before Stephen awoke to full realization that just outside the hong some one with untrained lips was attempting to play a foreign bugle . Hep191went to the window . On the bund , a Chinese soldier walked back and forth in his cloth shoes , strutting like a small boy proud of his uniform , proud of his horn . Stephen looked at Hester . She stirred in her sleep , drawing her brows together as she always did when any sound disturbedher . Slipping into his clothes , he tiptoed from the room and down to his new office . Jenkins , who had sat at his window the few remaining hours of the night after he had returned from the dinnerparty , heard Stephen 's step , and sneered cynically . " Fool , thinks he is somebody in the Company . " Well , he supposed he 'd made a fool of himself , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his youth , he could not hold it steady . Perhaps if it had n't been for those months marooned in that launch . . . . This damn country had done for him . He flung his hatred against it for destroying him . The hong awoke . First the coolie of Fenton , the number three master , the least in importance , arose , lighted the fire in the three masters ' stoves , put the kettles on for morning tea , serving Boynton 's and Jenkins ' coolies when they appeared in the inverse order of their importance . Then all three , their cloth shoes kicked off at the heel flip-flopping as they walked , carried pots of tea to their masters , the houseboys . " Ai , " the house-boys sucked in the hot tea . " This servant of the new master . He is an outside man . It is not good that he stay among us , taking our rice . " " We bring you news , " said the number three master 's coolie , " the new master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yah ! " exclaimed the house-boys . They put on their long gowns over their short inner coats , tied their trousers neatly around their ankles with black bands , and went to their duties about the hong . For such a master , all must be in order . Ai yah , mei yu fatsu , it can not be helped . Breakfast was over . The gate at the back of the compoundp192opened and shut . Three cooks , baskets upon their arms , sauntered leisurely forth toward the market-place . Each went alone , except the number one master 's cook . Because of his importance , a little " learn pidgin cook , " a mere child , trotted docilely at his heels carrying the market basket . Long was the market hour  --  the fish vender , the keeper of foreign goods , the fruit vender , all must ask , " What of the dauli of the new master ? " The door to the offices now began opening and shutting . The shipping men came , the accountants , the interpreters ; dressed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long cotton gowns , others of them . Short fragile-looking southernerswith faces like Dante . As they sat on high stools before their desks in the back office , the curve of their shouldersbeneath their smooth-fitting gowns was as uniform as the curve of a grove of young willows under a strong wind -- the scholar 's stoop , mark of breeding in China . One by one , on some pretext they made excuse to enter the office of the manager . Then for a little the door into Stephen 's new office ceased to open and shut . Stephen glanced at the wall clock opposite his desk . Ten o'clock . " You 'll find my report on the territory all here , " said Jenkins , throwing a bundle of closely written pages down on the desk . " As to Adviser Ho  --  you 'll have to pretend to use him . He knows the Company 's business from a to z  --  an agent once . The Company does n't let him go , because the British Company would grab him if they did . But he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provmce . Without a heralding knock , the door opened and a Chinese entered , of necessity stooping , for he was tall  --  amazingly so for a Chinese . Six feet two at least , was Stephen 's silent estimate . The heavy dove-gray silk gown falling to his heels did not suit him as it did his more delicately built country/men . Indeed , it increased his masculinity , as the habit sometimesincreases a monk 's . " I like that man , " was Stephen 's next reaction . " Oh , hello , Ho ! " Jenkins addressed the tall man in a careless tone , not bothering to rise . " So this is Ho , " thought Stephen with surprise , as he . rose giving the Eastern salutation . To his further astonishment , the visitor continued to stand , as if he were accustomed to do so in this office . Thoughtfully the new manager watched the little drama between the two men  --  Jenkins with his insolent superiority , Ho returning his insolence , although Jenkins was not aware of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deleting the Chinese epithets and the familiar " you " from Adviser Ho 's remarks . " Tell that outside barbarian whose mother was a turtle , that I know nothing of the activities of the august merchants of the province , " said Ho . " Ah hem ! " The Chinese interpreter settled his hornrimmedeye-glasses more securely on his bridgeless nose . Stephen caught a glint of joy in the man 's eyes as he sweetly interpreted . " He say , tell the honorable manager that he know nothing of Chinese merchant beesness . Each man veree close with his beesness . " Jenkins had brought this upon himself , but it made Stephen realize how necessary it was that his own first acts with the men of this province be correct . He knew too well that sudden stiffening of the Chinese into contempt . " They may not like me , but I intend they shall respect me , " he determined , not knowing that Ho had already judged him . When Ho went away , he had the knowledge he had come to gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the inner control . I shall not leave the employ of the Keepers of Light just yet , as I had thought . With this man , I can honorably contend . " * At the top of the Narrow House , Hester moved about , her spirit feeling out its new abode . In this ramshackle building where the floors shook a little even at her light step , and each badly fitted window shut and opened with its own particular protestation , the many activities of the hong were manifested to her in continuous bits of sound . Doors shutting , opening , far down at the bottom of the well of the stairs ; the cling , cling of a bell ; " Whei , whei ?  --  Who , who ? " shouted into the telephone receiver ; the voices of the Chinese ; the voice of Stephen . Through every window , the city intrudedits presence : stones tumbling about in a wooden box heralded the approach of a traveling food vender , the high squeak of wheelbarrows , a thousand tumultuous sounds . Now she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . her neighbors , gathered in a knot below on the bund . Presently they would come to see her , taking the gallerystairs to avoid the offices . Last night they had told her they would come . Friendship . Her neighbors were drawing near , crossing the floor of the second gallery . Now they were walking up the last flight of stairs ; the thin soles of their pumps , gritty with the dust of the bund , rasped on the wooden treads . Passing through the French window that gave on the gallery , Hester went to the top of the stairs , looking into the uplifted faces . " Hello ! " the women called up to her in chorus . " We 're most dead with the climb . You should have a lift , " wheezed the comfortable wife of the customs ' commissioner . " It 's lovely to have another woman here . Lovely ! " The consul 's wife ran up the last steps , and put her arms around Hester . They advanced , talking and laughing , Hester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them , telling them everything they asked , letting the intimacies of the tiny communitypluck at her privacy . But she felt herself shutp195away  --  something held her aloof . " Because of my habits of solitude , " she said to herself . " I 'll learn how to mingle with them . " All day the word passed over the city . " The new master is worthy . He is a keeper of custom . An honorable adver-sary . " The seller of curios picked out a precious piece or two , added a few spurious ones , packed them carefully , tying them up in a dirty white cloth . To-morrow he would visit the new mistress . So did the seller of ancient embroideries . Junkmen , chair-bearers , petty merchants , had heard the news . Good people had come among them . Early in the afternoon the great Ho went to see the city agent of the Keepers of Light . The two sat in the agent 's inner office , while to the broad cracks in the thin partition many an apprentice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the custom , " said Ho . Immediately the agent considered what old grievances against the Company he might present to this good manager . The apprentices slipped out to the teahouses , carrying the news , " The great Ho says a keeper of custom has come among us . " At evening the accountants , the shipping clerks , the coolies of the hong , returning to their homes , were the last bearers of the good news . In the fading light Kin sat on the top gallery outside the number one master 's kitchen  --  his master 's kitchen . This morning he had feared that the other servants would raise against him their resistance , driving him out , but now that the great Ho had made his master a worthy man in the eyes of the city , he , Kin , was too important for these underlings to send away . They were obsequious now , fearing he would bring in his own men . " Ai , " these servants should each pay him well , if he permitted them to stay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see any one who went into the number two , number three masters ' kitchens . Nothing in the bong should be purchased without a good per cent . being paid to him . " My teaching the master as we would our little children has brought reward ; no longer has he the bare and uninterestingmind of the barbarian . Even the great Ho has found him worthy . It is well that I came again into his service . When no big position came to him in Manchuria , I left him . But now he is a big man . As for the missie , a woman , and thus stupid , unteachable , I must rule her before she grows too old . Old women are powerful . If only she would grow fat with well-being ! " A narrow alley-way separated the hong from the garden of Ho , beyond which lay the courts of the ancestral dwelling . From his vantage point , Kin could see the tile roofs and a glint of white walls . A little to one side , far back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof line . Here , he had already learned , was the court of the old tai-tai , Ho 's mother , ruler of Ho . Yes , old women were powerful . Ai , immediately he must plan the affairs of this household before missie gained too much control . At eleven the next morning , the city agent entered Stephen 's office . His furled fan stuck out from the collar of his satin gown , rising like the end of a sword just behind his left ear . The day was exceedingly warm for early spring and , if the discussion became heated , he might need it before the encounter with this yellow-eyed , short-fingered one was over . All the way , with satisfaction , he had considered this visit . Ai , a keeper of the custom , was he ? Ting hao , very good . A good game with a good man . But he had no doubt he could hoodwink the new manager . When had there ever been an outside barbarian equal to a man of the Flowery Kingdom in the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He had decided to take up that loss of last month . Two hours later , as he walked away from the office fanning himself , he had respect for the new manager . In this firstp197skirmish of wits he had found that the pale washed-out-looking one had not a pale washed-out mind ! Deep and dark , it was . Ah , velvety , too , in its texture . He continued to enjoy the good points of Stephen 's game . Not only had this new manager not torn away the mask of his adversary , he had worn a mask himself . Ting hao , very good . None of that shocking intimacy of most barbarians . Ai yah ! Patience he has , too . Two hours , and I could not wear him down . Ah , well , another time . After others have contended with him , when he is a little discouraged . With measured step , he passed over the hard-beaten earth floor of his shop into his inner room . He lay down behind the drawn curtains of his bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One by one , the agents from over the province came to the hong to do battle with Stephen . Bit by bit , they worked upon him , trying to wear him down , to find how good an adversary he really was.  |p198STEPHEN  was not always so successful as he had been with the city agent , but as the days went by , he found that those years on the plain had brought him knowledge , accumulated unconsciously , lying fallow in his mind during his stay in America , guiding him now through the maze of his testing . And now an important thing began happening to him . Whenever he shut his eyes , whenever he let his mind idle for a moment , when he was dropping off to sleep , faces would appearbefore him  --  Chinese faces , all different . That sameness of agate eyes , folded eyelids , which had so bewildered him all the time he was in Manchuria , making him unable to distinguishcharacter , was no longer there . Just as his reaction to Ho had been , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Chinese , " his reaction to these faces appearing on the curtain of his eyelids was to character , not to cast of features . That agent from the south of the province  --  Lin , his name was . As Stephen lounged in his chair one evening after dinner , the man 's character was suddenly revealed to him . In the afternoon , when he had talked with Lin , Stephen had not realized it , but now he knew that Lin was sly . He could not analyze his knowledge . Some subtle quality in Lin 's lineless face made it furtive , not fearless like Ho 's , nor humorously belligerent like Chen 's . Yes , he 'd have trouble with Lin . He made a mental note to watch him . In a flash of intuition , he became certain , too , that Ho held the key to this territory , and could tell him much that would help him . If only he could make a friend of Ho ! He resolved to take a long trip with the merchant , though Jenkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephen had sought to avoid any clash of wills , but now he no longer feared to ask Ho , feeling certain that his suggestion would be accepted.  |p199Planning  the trip , Stephen determined to cut away his last prop ; he 'd leave Kin at home . He would no longer be nursed by his servant . In this illumination of the Chinese world , he knew Kin had always done this . Henceforth he should be plain house servant . Another thing  --  he would not take a book or magazine with him to clutter his mind with Western ideas . He must let his own world go , if he was to get the texture of the Chinese mind . Only so could he make a friend of Ho , and he must have Ho for his friend . Two weeks later , Stephen and Ho sat on the deck of the Company launch . The trip had been peculiarly devoid of revelations . Barriers of reticence and caution are thick , holdingmature men of the same nationality apart , but with these two of different race , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in silence , as immobile as the tall Chinese at his side , Stephen was trying to free his brain of activity . To do nothing was the hardest thing he had had to learn  --  to let go his usual tension of mind and become passive . To-night the desire to do something gnawed at him as hunger gnaws at the stomach . It was with the utmost difficulty that he held his mind closed to the things of his own world . The sailors on the launch moved about , setting all to rights for the night ; then one by one , attired in clean blue garments , they dropped into sampans , collected like a brood of chickens around the boat 's stern , and went off to feast in the town . Now Adviser Ho spoke , opening the conversation with the usual bland formalities . Stephen felt defeated , bored , as he responded to these often repeated phrases so meaningless to him . Then Ho bent toward him , as if fearful that even the quiet waters around them might have ears , speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come . Although he only half comprehended the meaning of Ho 's remark , one thing he did know  --  a gossamer thread was being extended to him , out of the closely wound ball of Chinese business methods , a cocoon-like growth of centuries . Stephen had a fantastic illusion that his fingers were reaching for that gossamer thread , but that they were too short to grasp it . To do so , they should be long like Ho 's , spread out on his silkcladknees . Then he had it , grasped between his short fingers . Guilds , the concealed force in Chinese life , as in Chinese business ! It was the thread that would unravel for him the cocoon . A guild of oil men , the ancient , secret , binding organization of the Chinese , now controlling this modern business of oil , though he had not suspected it , as it had for centuries controlledthe business of silk , rice , tea . Even artizans had guilds . The minutes passed . Let him be silent . Even though his silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to risk wrong speech . How much understanding was he supposed to declare ? The cocoon unwinding . Ho , a retiredmerchant , but not therefore out of the stride of business , as he would be in America . Ho , the center of the guild , the most important oil man in the province . Perhaps of the oil men all over the country . . . . Hold on , do n't unwind the cocoon too fast . The threads might get tangled . Guilds were not simple . Stop right there  --  Ho , the most important oil man in the province . And Jenkins had made him stand in his presence ! Had not stood himself in greeting ! And the Company had even been on the point of dismissing him ! Still Stephen dared not speak for fear of shattering the confidence between them . When at last he did , it was with the frankness with which he would speak to a fellowcountryman , knowing he could do this , because Ho was his friend . There was a chamber of friendship in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Very simply he said : " Teacher , will you help me ? " Adviser Ho answered him quietly . " This is a personal matter between us . The tong ja I will help , not the foreign Keepers of Light business . "  | " What you do for me , you do for the Company . The Company and I are one here . I am their servant . " Stephen spoke the word proudly . " Because of the rudeness of one man " He hesitated . " Surely the teacher understandsthat the Company would not have permitted this discourtesy , had they known  --  and Jenkins is leaving their employ . " But the dark look on the Oriental face beside him was not dispelled . " The Keepers of Light walk not the true path . Watch my fellow-countrymen in your outer office . When their wages have been increased so many times  --  like that Jenkins  --  some reason will be found to let them go . " " But Jenkins failed ! " cried Stephen . " He should go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are all one family now. , , " But look what the idea leads you to ! That is why your government fails . You put your personal relationship before your duty . " Stephen spoke impetuously now , risking that gift of friendship so seldom offered a foreigner . " You look at business ; we look at relationship . " " But one 's duty ! Surely it comes first , " insisted Stephen . " Ai yah , the Prior Born 's duty ! " Ho spread his knees far apart , so that the skirt of his gown fell between . He placed his long narrow feet , encased in their satin slippers , more firmly on the deck , then he spoke : " Our two customs we put behind us now , so that we may see each other . Good ? Not good ? So that our hearts may speak the same words . " " Yes , " said Stephen , " it is good . " A clue here , a clue there , of this and that agent , Ho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the night should not hear . Some comprehension of the intricacy of life for every man in this ancient country , came to Stephen . Each man entangled in clans , in guilds , grown more intricate through centuries , each man inheriting the intricacies of his father 's and his father 's father 's life . And yet Ho trustedp2o2 him enough to speak a little openly ! He felt humbled and very proud all in the same moment . Then of a sudden , intimacy was gone . Ho rose , dignified , aloof , formal , speaking again with conventional ceremony . For a moment , Stephen was dismayed . Had he offended ? Then he perceived that this was courtesy  --  Ho was giving him back his personality intact , the mask of formality again adjustedas it had been before entering the secret room of friendship . One did not end an evening on a note of intimacy . The formalities which had seemed so banal at the opening of the conversation did not bore Stephen now . He saw their purpose  --  freeingthem both from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ho went to his cabin . If the new manager had thought that everything would be simple for him after that night , he soon found he was mistaken . That intimate moment with Ho was not repeated after their return . But Adviser Ho came every morning now to the bong . After the clerks were in their places in the back office , with due ceremony he would come in his sedan chair , taking his place of honor at Stephen 's left hand . In perfunctory fashion , he advised on routine matters of business . But Stephen understood that this was all Ho dared to do , involved as he was in the intricacies of Oriental life . It was his own hard luck , he told himself , if he could not work out a strong organization from the clues already given him . No longer was Stephen outside as he had been in Manchuria , fumbling in the dark . Day by day he found himself exploringminds developed in a different school of thought than that in which he had been trained . Now he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a light thing , not something theatrical as he had imagined ; essential in such intricate surroundings . Stephen began to speculate . Would not the complete loss of face , the surrender of dignity , be for the Chinese the great sacrifice , more to a man than the sacrifice of life ?  |p203It  was mysterious and silent , this corning together of alien minds . He led now a secret inner life apart even from Hester . In confiding in her , translating his knowledge into Western thought , he might let slip the gossamer thread of understanding , or a listening ear might lose Ho to him for ever . Even their bedroom he now knew was a part of the huge whispering gallery of China . Hiding his new understandingbehind a quiet reserve , he forced his mind down strange alleys of thought . Stephen glanced up from the empty desk he was contemplating . So Ting had come , just as he had expected . It was he who had set the snares that had beguiled Agent Ting into coming . This man would not work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knowing now the rules of wearingthe mask , he was going to change them a little like an artist who knows the laws of his art well enough to break them . He meant to make a thrust behind this man 's mask . Ting refused to be seated . He was a short thick-set Chinese , with a large paunch which gave him the effect of strutting . He was cross-eyed , and now in his excitement the gaze of his left eye seemed to wander off at its own will in a rakish , devil-may-care way . " And once I thought that all the Chinese look alike ! " was the passing thought in Stephen 's mind , as he listened to Ting 's words exploding like bombshells . " For years I have set at naught the interests of my miserableself , making a mere pittance , striving night and day , selling thousands of the tins of the foreign oil , and now Prior Born accuses me of . . . " The agent stuttered , grew almost apoplectic . Did not this fool know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the province ? No such fine credit as his ? Ting 's attitudinizing turned suddenly into a burst of real anger . " I resign . " He leaned near Stephen , shouting the words almost in his face.  | " I say you can not resign . " Ting 's left eye shot up to an even higher angle , but the fireworks of his speech died away in sputtering . The barbariantelling him , the leading merchant of the south , that he could not resign . Final indignity ! " No , " thundered Stephen , bringing his fist down on the table . He was venturing far . According to Chinese custom , by that bang on the table he had informed the agent that he was his master . " Mr. Ting prattles about losing face . Face ! What is the little outer mask stripped off , compared with the face Mr. Ting will lose if he resigns ? A merchant of China who does not know how to sell . See , they will know , for I shall tell them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent . Ting brought his left eye down to survey the paper . How had the foreign one learned all this ? No other barbarian had known so much , where he sold , and where he did not . " Resign , and to the Thousand Li Wall I will tell that the honorable Ting could not get business . " Did this insignificant barbarian know of the Oil Guild ? Ting regarded the white man with a degree of respect . " Talk about resigning ! It is I who should dismiss you , " Stephen whispered across the desk . " But how could I think of doing so , when it would mean that you would leave this room without even the thinnest tissue mask over your naked heart ? Go out now , Ting , chief merchant of the south of the province , and get me the business . And when in every one of these shops Mr. Ting is selling the foreign light , then he may come to me and resign with safety . " Ting folded his hands within his long sleeves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , manager , manager . " There was something of servility in his tone . He would go out , and he would exert himself like a barbarian . This foreign one knew how to ruin him , so that he could not live in this province . Never before had he felt respect for ap205barbarian , but he hated Stephen , too , for forcing him to energy , an exercise as terrifying to men of an old race as a child 's activity to his elders . The door closed upon him . Stephen dropped his grand manner . He had gone pretty far with cock-eyed Ting . He had thought for a moment his thrust had gone too deep , and that it would be necessary for Ting to resign . But he had had to take the risk in order to rouse the agent to energy ; the head office was already demanding his dismissal and Stephenknew that if he were dismissed , Ho would regard it as a violation of the personal relationship . He could write the Company now that Ting would work . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letter , a sweet sense of power possessed him . There was a knock , the door swung open , and the engineerfrom the Company launch stood with a broken part of the engine in his hands . " Tai-pan , it refuses to work . " Stephen in an instant had the parts in his hands , studying them . His knowledge of machinery told him what was wrong . There was nothing to do . This part would have to be discarded . There 'd have to be a new one . He turned to give his order  --  a copy could be made at the ironmonger 's in the city . Then he remembered . He could not make this small expenditure without the consent of the main office . " Go now , manager of the machinery . I will attend to this , " said Stephen . When the door closed , he sat drumming on the desk with his fingers , hating to write the main office for permission to spend this small sum of money . A moment before he had felt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards had collapsed . He was only a clerk ! Again there was a knock . Fenton , of all people , that annoyingboy who seemed to spend his time planning how he could get out of work.  |p2o6  " Would you mind , " began Fenton , hesitating , for he saw that Stephen was in a black mood . " That trip I was to start on this afternoon  --  if I waited until after Sunday ? Todaythere 's a port picnic , and I 'd like to be here Sunday , too . " " It ca n't be done , " snapped Stephen , turning to get some papers out of the files . Fenton looked angrily at Stephen 's unresponsive back . Then , not daring to ask again , he went out . " I might have given him his Sunday , " Stephen thought with a secret sense of shame . " But he 's always loafing on the job . " Somehow with that command he had been released from his own humiliation . He had power over men . Fenton had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of common humanity went from him when he gave Fenton his orders . He only knew that he was beginning to make a good manager.  |p207THE  spring rice was harvested . Again the fields were plowed and flooded . Not the tiniest space of land at the head of the mountain valleys ignored  --  a field no larger than a man 's head-cloth would bring forth its bowl of rice . Only the graves of the ancestors were not plowed , standing up like haycocks , but they would yield their rough grass for fuel . Now the fields were again ready and the rice stood thick in the seed beds . With the first streak of light men and boys walked in the black ooze of the paddies transplanting the rice . And so summer broke , forced into early abundance by the needs of the millions packed in the valley . The highways of the valley  --  the river , the streams , the canals , there were no roads  --  were fair things to see . Through the long day flotillas of brown-sailed junks sailed upon them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rice hid the shimmer of water , making it seem that the junks sailed through the green sea of rice . Now when the water was deep in river and canal was the moment of communication in the green valley , even as the winter had been in the north ; now was the moment to supply the farthest village . Stephen was told to offer long credits , and the junks went weighted with the foreign oil . Thus was China drawn into world trade . Her progress hurried , the delicate balance of the green valley disturbed ; native peanut oil standing unsold , replaced by the foreign product . The heat , even now , lay like a blanket over the earth , sappingthe strength of white people . The white women were going away . But Hester was not going . It was unthinkable to her to leave Stephen . The women , her neighbors , drifted in saying good-by , urgingher again and again to go with them . " But the heat , Mrs.p208Chase . You ca n't guess how dreadful it is , " they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered Hester . " I have no reason to go . " With a sense of relief , she heard the last one go down the steps of the gallery . Only a narrow alleyway separated the hong from the ancestralhome of Ho , but the women of the two families did not mingle . Ho 's mother hated the outside barbarians  --  bringers of new customs . She spat when she spoke of them , refusing to meet Hester , although her son desired it . But there was nothing harmful in the barbarian 's money , so she did not oppose the intercourse between Ho and Stephen . When Hester first realized that the two men were becomingfriends , she thought she too might find friends in Ho 's household among the women . Looking across the roofs to the sweet olive tree , spreading its pattern of leaves on the gray roof-tiles , she wondered if some time she might know that powerful woman , whose court was shaded by the great tree . One evening her quick ear caught , above the noises of the alley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It revived in her an old desire to find music in this country . She asked Stephen if he could get the song from Ho . " It is nothing , " said Ho , " one of the servants playing . " Then Hester asked Kin if he could get the song , but he did not seem to comprehend what she wanted . He did not tell her that when Ho had brought word of Hester 's desire , the old tai-tai was very angry that the white woman should thus intrude herself . For if Hester were to have the song , she must come to the great house , or the daughter-in-law who had played , must go to the barbarian 's house since the Chinese do not write their music , the listener remembering , rendering it again according to his own interpretation . " This is what it has come to ! " said the mother of Ho . " Admitting these barbarians to our city . Their curious earsp209would listen even at the inner courts . When I was a girl the officials would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked , the tai-tai became more and more angry until the house was filled with her wrath . Slaves , servants and daughters-in-law alike fell under her anger , and none could please her while the anger lasted . Even Ho 's head wife did not escape her displeasure . As for the young daughter-in-law  --  just a month in her house  --  who had played the song , the old tai-tai lashed her with her tongue . " Exposing yourself to attention like a common woman ! Wanton ! I 'll teach you ! " And the tai-tai clapped her hands sharply for her own serving woman to come . Although the amah , standing outside listening to all that was said , waited only long enough to have it seem that she came from the servants ' quarters , the mistress rapped her sharply over the hand with her fan . " Sluggard ! " she shouted . " Worthless and lazy one ! Call me the servants ! " When they came , she went with them to the court of the young daughter-in-law , herself seeing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near her own . All day the wretched girl answered the call of her mother-inlaw , bringing steaming towels for her face , bringing her pipe , bringing sweetmeats , trembling with fear as the tai-tai 's anger mounted , while she whipped the great household with the lash of her tongue . When evening settled down over the city and the birds twittered their night call in the sweet olive tree , the old woman 's anger left her and she dozed in her straight chair , her black brows drawn together , her full face , despite its coating of white rice powder and rouge , a vulgar common face , very different from the delicate countenance of her daughter-in-law . The young girl , near by in her own quarters , slept too , but she was alert even in her sleep , fearful lest her mother-in-law call her and she not hear . The servants and the slave girls 0sat about in watchful ease , like people living in a country of sudden storms , snatching rest when they can . An old man went out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacquered basket . He was walking quickly for so aged a man . " Open , open , " he called , knocking on the door of a hut . The woman who pulled back the door was as old as himself and as poorly clad . But her face bore the mark of breeding , intensified by the fine etching of suffering . She spoke quietly but with a note of authority in her voice . " Ts Dong , you are late to-day . " " Mei yu f atsu , tai-tai , it could not be helped . The old one 's eyes have been everywhere to-day . Only now that she sleeps could I leave . Days like this did not come when the honorableone was our mistress . " Once , indeed , this woman had been mistress in the great house , honored first wife of Ho 's father . But she had borne him no son . So when his concubine , mother of Ho , had desirednot only the place of honor in the house , but the putting away of the head wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first lady had lived in this hovel , attended only by the old servant appointed by Ho 's father to serve her . " It was all on account of these Keepers of Light , " Ts Dong explained . " The old one was angry over their impertinence . And even the great Ho , gentle as he is , is annoyed that this one he calls friend should seek to penetrate into the secret entirety of a man 's house . " Hester would have remained in ignorance of all this had she not a few days later , heard children in Ho 's garden singing at their play , and summoned Kin to listen so he would know what she wanted this time . But Kin never brought her the song . At first he said , " Wait a little , " and when she again asked him , he feigned ignorance of her meaning . Then Hester , whom long ago Kin had taught the futility of beating her will against his passive resistance , knew quite as certainly as if he had told her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p2IIStill  she hoped she might know Ho , of whom Stephen talked so much . It was at the beginning of the summer that her husband sought to include her in the friendship . He had waited to do this until he knew Ho very well , for he did not wish to repeat that mistake he had made in Manchuria . On the day appointed for his call , gravely respecting the custom of his friend , Ho came through the door of the livingroom , bending his great shoulders , bowing gravely to Hester , not dishonoring this good woman by raising his eyes to look upon her . He took the tea Kin gave him , and nibbled at one of the foreign cakes . And when Stephen asked him where Hester could secure old bits of porcelain , he said that he himself would send the dealer with whom he dealt . Then from his long sleeve he took a bowl . Hester exclaimed over its color and shape which delighted her eye . When Ho held it again in his hand within his sleeve he moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape was beautiful to feel . Before he left , Ho stood for a time before a painting Nester'sfather had left her  --  a single stem of bamboo  --  and the next day he sent his friend 's wife one to companion it . Stephen felt the visit had been a great success . His friend and his wife had many tastes in common ! But this time Hester understood . She knew that , notwithstanding Ho 's politeness , she did not exist for him in the things of the spirit . Depression crept upon her . This dwelling in alien minds made of her a gray ghost , brought an emptying away of her personality . For some time now when Stephen 's agents came to consult him , he had turned to Ho , asking him to make the Company 's wishes plain to them . Then one day Ho said , " Send the agents to me first . The tai-pan can tell me whether he will grant their petitions . If not they will not lose face with the tai-pan . The tai-pan is a hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Often after that , when Ho spoke for Stephen , he softenedp212his words without changing the meaning . And sometimes he added more than Stephen had spoken . He told the agents that the manager 's heart was gentle ; only his lips spoke sternly . Because of the organization , he was stern . It was his dauli . His relation to the Company was to him what the relationshipsof father to son , friend to friend , were to Chinese . He spoke thus because he did not wish Stephen to harm himself . In other ways , also , it helped Stephen , this sending the agents to Ho . It saved him time , for each one of them , trying to wear him down in order to get more privileges from the Company , often contended with him for an entire day . And , as the weeks went by , he knew that he needed his time to find out and curb the " squeeze , " if this illegitimate gain of every agent , clerk , shipping man , junkman , coolie in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it would ruin the business . Especially were inroads increasing at the oil tanks . Stephen and the white man who guarded them night and day waged a continuous fight against the slow dribblingaway of the oil . Long ago , guards had been brought from another province , so that there would be hatred between them and the workers , and each would check the squeeze of the other . But now it seemed they were in league , for more than a little oil was going out secretly . Increasingly , as Stephen felt out the Chinese mind , he discovered that the idea of squeeze permeated it . And he realized that the Chinese did not consider it dishonest . They had no sense of guilt about it . He wished he could get some help from Ho on the matter . But even when they were alone , Ho gave him no clue . At last Stephen spoke openly . They were together in the closedintea-house in the center of Ho 's garden , where they had formed the habit of sitting at the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarettes upon it . Here , better than in the office , they could talk . This tea-house with its fretted windows , the oiled paper panes changed by Ho for foreign glass , gave them a view of the whole garden  --   |p213no  unseen listening ears here to make them wary of speech . Stephen spoke of his suspicions , telling of his worry . He watched Ho narrowly . If his friend did not tell him directly , perhaps some faint expression of knowledge passing across Ho 's face , would indicate that his suspicions were correct . But Ho sat in contemplation , the lids of his eyes lowered , as the Buddha 's eyes are lowered ; his mouth , as usual , serene ; his beautiful delicate hands , oddly feminine on this huge man , crossed inside his purple silk sleeves , as always when he was at rest . For a moment Stephen had the illusion that he had not spoken to Ho , only thought the words . Then he was filled with bitter disappointment . He had been rebuffed  --  and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing called " squeeze " so lightly spoken of by foreigners ? Something sinister behind it . He pondered his friend 's withdrawal from confidence , more perhaps than he would have done , had he continued to see Ho each day as usual ; but the day after their conference , a message came , saying that Ho could not come to the office as the old tai-tai , his mother , was ill . At first Stephen worriedlest he had destroyed the friendship . Squeeze , he knew , was as a rule taboo as a subject of conversation  --  had Ho made pretense of his mother 's sickness in order to declare indirectly the ending of their relationship ? The sickness of the honored mother was the excuse most often given , in lieu of the correct reason , when any one in the office wished to absent himself . Then a second message came telling Stephen that the old tai-tai , head of the clan , had died . Stephen knew that this was so . Already , the wails of the two hundred-odd members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Men passed in and out of the gates , dressed in white robes of mourning , white shoes with red at the heels . The red strips of paper at each side of the gate were taken down , white ones put in their place . Then a third time Stephen received a message from Ho . One of the servants came bearing two flat packages of white cloth which he presented to Stephen , mourning for Hester and himself , invitation to enter the house of Ho and wish the tai-tai safe passage to the other world . But Stephen could almost hear the old lady 's cane tapping in angry dissent . No foreigner should enter her presence . He knew , too , that Ho had invited them only out of friendly courtesy and did not expect them to come . So he sent regrets and a silk scroll to be hung in the ancestral hall ; bright blue with white characters , long enough to reach from floor to ceiling . But he kept the bundles of white cloth , tangible evidence of the great Ho 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the beating of the drum in the outer court at the arrival of each guest , and the days of the chanting of the priests opening up the way to the Western Heaven for the tai-tai , and for many days after , Stephen held this courtesy in his heart to assure himself that Ho still was his friend . Yet he did not wholly sense how significant had been Ho 's act . This was a time of important ceremony in his friend 's household , the most important until his own death , and there was much to be attended to . Also Ho was a superstitious man and many fears attended him , lest by neglect he omit some precaution against evil spirits and bring disaster on the family . There was , too , the proper choosing of the time of the old one 's funeral . It disturbed Ho that the necromancer had set the lucky day but one moon away . He felt in his heart it was too soon to be properly ceremonious . Yet in the midst of these grave family matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heat lying over the valley sapped the strength of Hester . She lay all day in a long chair between window and door to catch the faintest stirring of air . Her languor seemed to loosen her spirit so that it dwelt lightly in her body , borne aloft on the laboring heart of the land , on the chants of labor . " Hai yo-oh ! High low-oh ! " . . the syncopated chant , made by the jarred breath of the humanp215pile drivers ; " E-au ! E-au ! " . . . the breath forced from a man 's chest , the chant of the heavy laden . There were no duties to worry Hester . Kin had been solicitousof the tai-tai 's ebbing strength . He would look after the hong . Only let missie give him the keys , so he need not disturbher when she slept late in the morning . And Hester had given them into his care , taking delight in the homage of service . To be served , was to have existence heightened . No longer did she look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished was to serve her , and she had been unwilling . Kin , sensing her acquiescence , knew that his time had come . " Ai yah , " now he could rule her . Stephen came often and sat by her chair , solicitous too . " Are you all right , sweet ? " His love for Hester had become the rock on which he erected the structure of his activities . Sometimes he would come up from the office after hours , stand a moment looking down upon her , gaining vitality from her presence , then go back to do some bit of difficult work he had saved until the place was empty and quiet . And , sometimes , looking at her in her idleness , he would experience a sudden pleasure in his own intensely lived days  --  those arduous days of his which made it possible to keep Hester secure . One day she heard him hurrying up the stairs . " Hester , " he cried , " read this . " " What is it ? " she asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he answered . " How nice ! " exclaimed Hester . " It 's such a big increase this year . " " Sh ! " Stephen , put his hand lightly over her mouth . " This house is full of ears . " " Now I can have the number two boy that Kin says we should have , because master is the great tai-pan ! " exclaimed Hester , hardly noticing . " Yes and a second coolie  --  " Stephen put the letter into his pocket . " It means they like what I 've done up here , " he said . " Strange , " thought Hester , as he went away . " It wasn't the increase he cared about , it was the Company 's approval . " But for the first time in her life she contemplated the value of money for the power it gave her . The next morning , passing for a moment through the butler 's pantry , she was attracted by a letter lying on the morning tea-tray . Opening it , she saw it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? Had Stephencarelessly dropped it that morning and Kin picked it up ? Odd that it should have been this particular letter , that had fallen into Kin 's hands . Odd and a little disturbing . When she gave the letter to Stephen , for a moment he was angry . " Damn Kin ! " he said . " He must have got it out of my pocket when he arranged my clothes this morning . " Then his anger was gone . " Mei yu f atsu , " he said , " it ca n't be helped . He 'd have found out somehow . I 've noticed that one 's expenses go up with one 's position . It 's good we 've got a pension ahead of us . " Kin , coming into the pantry , saw that the letter was not there . Had the white vixen , then , returned to her ways of a common woman ? He had been at such pains to teach her that she lost face in exerting herself . " Mei yu fatsu ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the barbarian 's language who sat in the outer office . The extra money to come to the household was better than he had hoped . He had done wisely when he stayed with this master . To-night when he went to the tea-house he would arrange for that woman he had long desired . The gambling among the servants of white men should be moved to his quarters , his now should be the place of importance . When finally that night he lay down in his bed , he had gambled away a great sum . Ai yah , fortune had not attended him . The entirety of his master 's increase must fall into his hands , if he were to pay his debts . The number two houseboymust be hired , and the extra coolie , so he could receive part of their wages . From everything that came into thep217house , he must take an extra commission  --  and missie must buy more . How could he teach her to want more ? In this he had not yet succeeded . When he tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embroideries , the little trinkets , the laces , the bronzes  --  she bought sparingly as a man would buy . The " little heat " was passed ; the " great heat " drew on towardits fulness . Day after day no rain fell , and the second rice began to turn yellow before its time . The water that had been garnered in reservoirs was fed to the fields , and along the streams and the river all night the feet of men walked the endless treads of the chain pumps . Then , except along the river , the foot pumps were still , for there was no more water in reservoir or stream . In the city , there came a time when the water taken from the wells was thin mud . Each day the line of water-carriers at the river grew longer . In a lengtheningqueue , they moved over the river bank , a thin yellow band in the distance . The farmers , idle now , moved along the alley-like streets of the city , along the bund , crowding the sampans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the river . They would petition their gods for rain . What did the gods want ? Reverence ? Three steps and we kneel . Sacrifice ? Hooks hung in our flesh that the gods may see and give us a little rain , in order that our sons may live . No meat or fowls or eggs sold in the city ; no life of any kind taken , except for the sacrifice of bull and ram made by the governor . Stephen , walking daily through the city , watched the money market grow tight , the price of rice go up . In many small shops men sat idle . It startled him to see how small was the margin on which the people of the valley bought ; how quickly it was wiped out . In his offices , although they had wages and would not starve , clerk , junkman and coolie squeezed as they had never squeezed before . They seemed to partake of the common fear.  | Stephen forgot the delight of his intellectual adventure in exploring the Chinese mind , forgot his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unconsciously one with those around him , some instinct within him vibrating to the fundamentalcalamity . When he found the office coolie palming stamps from letters , he did not dismiss him as he would have done a month ago . And although he watched now more closely than ever to keep down the squeeze , it was in a new mood . Not with the censoriousness of an outsider , but with the sympathy he would have felt , looking upon a like manifestationamong his own people . Stephen tried to keep from Hester that there was danger of famine . High at the top of the hong , sheltered , secluded , she failed to understand the full significance of the drought . She saw only a gay pageant moving across the bund : peasants with yellow knapsacks bound for the temples ; the gods , decked in bright red robes , riding in chairs on the shoulders of men who carried them out to view the metallic sky , the bright sterile clouds . Finding delight in sound and movement , she grew excited over the spectacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity , she knew not what , and when Kin came , saying a white pedlar stood outside with a bundle " greatly big , " she welcomed the diversion . It was a Russian , tall and gaunt , who entered at Kin 's bidding . Kneeling by his pack , he took from it rugs glowing in color , soft as silk . Hester , coveting the most beautiful of the rugs , began bargaining , seeing in the man 's eagerness the desire to sell at any price . She had just completed her bargain , when Stephen came at her summons to pay the man . He looked at Hester , vivid with the excitement of possession , bright spots in her cheeks . He heard the sounds coming up from the bund . Bang ! Bang ! Men beating upon brass gongs , a frenzy of gongs , propitiationof the gods , the heavens , he knew not which . But he knew that it was desperate entreaty to end the drought . Famine at the doors  --  and Hester buying a costly rug !  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hong 's full of Company rugs.9 " But they 're so ugly , Stephen . Look at this one on the floor . It 's got two darns in it . The new one would look lovely in this room . " She laid her hand on the soft surface of the rug . " We ca n't , Hester . " " Why not ? " she demanded , feeling resentment over his unwillingness , remembering his substantial increase . " Because there 's famine . " The pent-up strain under which Stephen had been laboring , broke its bounds . " When there 's famine , the people ca n't buy . This is my first managership . I have n't made good yet . My whole future is built on sales . I do n't know yet how bad the famine will be , how far it 's going to spread , maybe over the whole province . Suppose the sales drop instead of increasing ? The Company sees no extenuating circumstances  --  eitherI win or I lose . Suppose I lose -- Hester sat back on her heels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I did n't know , Stephen . " He was angry with himself . He had not wanted to shatter Hester 's sense of security . It was for that he was working . " Better buy the rug , I guess we can swing it , " he added hastily . " We have n't famine yet . I 'm probably borrowing trouble . " Hester looked at Stephen as he counted out the money , but her pleasure in her purchase was gone . Famine looked out at her . She remembered the trek of the peasants in Manchuria , their faces . That was what had stalked behind their eyes  --  hunger ! Famine ! Her spirit drew back . Stephen went to his office . Bang ! Bang ! The noise grew louder , a frenzy of noise . There came a day when the sun shining as brilliantly as before from the glittering sky , wrought some new tension in the city . Along the streets , in every house , every one 's eyes were turned skyward . The servant passing through the hongp220stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no rain to-day , for forty days there will be no rain , they told Stephen . Toward noon , a few clouds drifted across the sky ; clouds empty of rain they seemed to Stephen , standing at the window . Then , as if dropped from the blue , raindrops fell . But they had no vigor , none behind them to push them on . The servants moved through the hong closing the windows . " The rain , the rain , it will come . " It did not matter that the rain had stopped . The soothsayer had said it would come like this , at first a little . Early the next morning Hester was wakened by the silence . No murmuring voices , no cries of children came up to her from the poor who of late had been sleeping on the bund , no clang of cymbals as the gods rode forth . Only the gentle and monotonous fall of rain . Her spirit took back its buoyancy . She turned on her pillow and slept . The shadow of famine was gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less resilience of hope . A partial famine , insecurity pushed only a little into the background . Well before sundown one afternoon , the black gates of Ho 's ancestral house were opened wide . The men of the family , all in white sackcloth , Ho looming above them , came forth bearing the things of the spirit world , all of paper . Paper servants  --  amahs and gardeners and men servants ; a handsomechair with six bearers ; rickshas , perhaps not too frail for the shadow world ; a house with its many courts , replica of the ancestral home the old woman 's spirit had so recently quit . A full-sized stage , held above the heads of men by means of bamboo poles , was borne forward , a hundred paper actors were carried jauntily on the shoulders of coolies . Amah called Hester . The bong windows were full of servantsand office staff . " Ai yah , " they exclaimed , as the spirit things were laid in a great pile . " Grand beyond measure ! " " Ai yah ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ho clan thousands upon thousands of coppers ! " OIL FOR THE LAMPS OF CHINA 221p221A half-hour and the things of the spirit world were a heap of ashes . The next morning around the ancestral dwelling there was a bustle of an important journey about to be undertaken  --  So had the tai-tai , the one-time concubine of Ho 's father , long the first lady in the household , looked upon it  --  the one important journey , the supreme adventure . Many years beforeshe had arranged every detail . And now at last she , who had not often been beyond the confines of her own domain , started on her long anticipated journey . The gates were flung wide . Out came the musicians , out came the banners carried aloft by men in green robes , out came the mourners in white  --  the great Ho leading , his brothers , his sons , his cousins behind , the last outer ramificationsof the family following . What a family it was ! Only now did Stephen realize how many of the Ho clan were in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depletedin the last few days . Even the gateman had asked leave to go home , saying his mother was very sick . There he was now , humble member of the clan , almost the last in the line of white-clad mourners turning left on the bund . Now came the great lacquered coffin , escorted by a monstrouspaper dragon . The head , supported by men , rose in front of the coffin which appeared to rest on the undulating body . The tail , supported by many children , flapped behind . An angry monster , guarding the precious freight that rode upon its back . Last came the women of the clan , those of importance hid behind the drawn curtains of their chairs . Now and then there was a glimpse of a white slipper , a white sleeve , a delicate yellow hand . Amahs with children in white , white cloth around their heads , rode in rickshas at the end of the procession . Even in a city of magnificent funerals , this one caused excitement . " It 's worth all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family crowded the bund in front of the office . In noise and confusion they filled a flotilla of sampans . Then the dirge rose into its last high wail , as the coffin of the tai-tai came to rest on the deck of the Company launch which Stephenhad lent for the occasion . Lost in the dirge were the signals to the engine-room . As the engineer 's head rose above the hatchway to get his orders , Stephen caught a glimpse of him , his head swathed in the turban of mourning . He , too , a member of the clan ! The launch moved out into deep water , little boats , sails set , trailing behind as if pulled by the band of moving water in the wake of the launch . The hong seemed very still . Across the way there was no perceptiblemovement in the courts of the Ho compound , only the leaves of the olive tree moved in a little wind . Now and then a leaf dropped , drifting down into the empty court below . Stephen closed the door of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ho  --  was he a friend ? Or was he simply trying to see what he could get ? Stray incidents , at the time insignificant , came back to him : Ho suggesting a new gateman at the bong  --  the other was not trustworthy ; Ho , when the new launch was to be sent up from Shanghai , asking Stephen to write the Company of a local man who knew the treacheries of the river  --  a local man who had not proved to know so much about the river after all , thought Stephen , with a wry smile . Doubts of his friend assailed him . In how many other ways did Ho use his friendship for gain ? Ho , too , not to be trusted ? The old reaction  --  all of them crafty . He arraigned Ho before the tribunal of his own standards and found him wanting . Disgust filled him ; the friendship , as far as he was concerned , was finished . But not so easily could he destroy it . Tenaciously , this friendship was rooted in Stephen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The coolie looked in to see if the master had left . If he could attend to the master 's office , he could go to that second job he never told about , which he held withp223those other white people across the city . He squatted on his heels outside the door , patiently waiting . Stephen sat on , tipped back in his revolving chair , his hands behind his head , trying to save his friendship , trying to understand . Since the days of threatened famine with their terror of starvation , a new pattern lay over his mind . Things he had seen since he had come to China , isolated in his mind heretofore , now fitted into that pattern like the parts of a puzzle . The peasant on the ample plains of Manchuria making a last gleaning of the fields , not bold and daring pioneers , those peasants , but men with the memory of want and poverty . And now , even here in this fertile valley , poverty  --  everywhereits manifestations . Paper-thin bottoms of kettles , a few twigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coldness of winter , only charcoal hand or foot stoves ; people coming from market , a two-inch piece of pork , or a chicken 's wing , the day 's suppy of meat ; vegetables bought sparingly , water used sparingly . Now he knew what lay behind squeeze  --  centuries of want . But Ho  --  there was no excuse for him ; he was rich , as riches go in the East . Then across Stephen 's mind the scenes of the day marshaled themselves . The long line of men in their sackcloth , the rickshas and chairs of the women . He sensed the solidarity of Ho 's life with the life of his clan ; not a separate life , as Stephen 's . Ho , the head of the clan ; Ho , with two hundred pairs of hands clinging to his garments ; Ho , every day vicariouslypartaking of want . And suddenly Stephen did not doubt Ho 's sincerity of friendship , even though he knew now that he must watch Ho as he did the others . Hester was calling him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hong . That evening Stephen made his second great contribution to the corporation . In his youth , as he had sat on a brick k'ang watching the flickering light of a peanut oil lamp cast on a dirt floor , had come the inspiration of the lamp . Then he had seen a vision of China recreated on the grand scale of America , also power and recognition for himself . Now , in his maturity , he sat in his comfortable suite in the hong , slouched down in his easy chair , his eyes upon the rug Hester had bought , his mind turned inward , seeing success for the Company in fitting the business into Chinese poverty . A picture stood in his mind of a corner of Ho 's wall and the seller of peanuts who sat there day in day out , in cold and heat , rain or sun . Before him , resting on an old tub , a wooden tray ; and neatly arranged upon the tray , piles of shelled peanuts , three , four in a pile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , as millions like him thought , if he would put a lamp in every house throughout the province . A three-cent lamp  --  many a man 's wages for a whole day . If he increased the business , he and his men must be patient enough to make a shop-to-shop inspection of the province . The tiniest shop which sold native oil must not be overlooked . He would make a record of the infinitesimal sales of the province . After that , the agents should be pressed to make these " four peanut sales , " as Stephen called them now . Insignificant in themselves , gigantic when you multiplied them by the millions upon millions who bought in such minute quantities . This time Stephen dreamed no dreams of personal greatness . He would try the scheme out . If it worked he would pass the plan on to Shanghai to use as they saw fit . That they would adopt the idea without comment if they liked it , now seemed natural to Stephen.  |p225WHEN  the " great heat " was over the spent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unto itself renewed life . The hong regained activity . Boynton and Fenton had returned from their vacations . All the clerks who had absentedthemselves on one pretext or another were back in their places  --  the coolie was busy carrying them tea and steaming cloths to wipe their faces . The substitute gateman had departed , the former one was again at his post . Once more Ho sat each morning at Stephen 's side , a grave and astute adviser . Now Stephen determined to try out his new scheme for increasing the business . He wired Shanghai for permission to travel , and leaving Boynton in charge of the office , started forth with Ho to visit the territory of the cock-eyed Ting . As the chair coolies trotted forward , carryingthem in on the valley floor away from the river , he noticed with concern the effect of the drought . The flagged path wound along the raised rim of the paddies , and he could look into the fields  --  not a thick carpet of yellow rice heads ; the rice stood so sparsely that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were going carefully over the paddies cutting the scant rice heads . The beat of thin sheaves on the edge of the threshing boxes reached Stephen 's ears . A year before he would have thought such fields not worth harvesting , and he would have asked Ho why they bothered with this meager crop , as they had the spring rice for their winter 's supply . But now he knew that , even in this rich valley , it was a hand-to-mouth existence . In the distance appeared two broken gray and white lines edging the path on both sides ; gradually the lines revealed themselves as white plastered walls and gray-tiled roofs . " How little the towns take from the fields , " thought Stephen.  | Then at last they were hard upon the village , entering the narrow street between the shops . A rap on the chair-poles . With sighs and grunts , the chair coolies lowered the chairs , and Stephen and Ho stepped over the poles into the street , enteringtogether the first shop that sold oil . Inside the shop , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high counter and the shopkeeper behind it . In a dark recess beyond the counter , they were aware of half-revealed figures  --  a woman seated on a low chair made of bamboo , a child standing beside her pulling at her breast , a baby asleep on her lap . The woman 's black hair merged into the shadow of a bed , its interior like a dark lair beyond the looped-back curtains of coarse cloth . Shop and house was this room . Once Stephen would have felt the oil business superior to such petty trade . But now , realizing the enormous numbersof such shops , he noted with interest the supplies  --  two pieces of cloth neatly folded lying on a shelf behind the counter , a few red candles , a jar probably full of coarse sugar , and a discarded oil tin of his own Company , half full of peanutoil , heavy and brown as lubricating oil . How could it be replaced with a quarter-tin of the Company 's oil ? How could the man be made to change ? The open shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . Into the air , heavy with the odors of unwashed bodies and the dank smell of the earth floor , the guttural speech of Ho fell , uttering the polite phrases of his race , speaking of that matter of supreme importance  --  sons . " I , the miserable one , have only two , " answered the shopkeeper . Speaking later of business , he said , " For generations have we sold oil in this shop  --  I , and my father before me , and even before that . At the time of the winter moons , twelve catties ; at the time of the summer moons , six . It is good oil . Is it not so , to sell so much each moon since I was a child , since my father was a child , and his father ? " It took long to break down the shopkeeper 's reticence , andp227to learn that he had a capital of ten dollars on which to run his business . Sugar and oil , dye and a little cloth , he sold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , making a sharp line of brilliance along the center of the street ; when they left it had moved westward so that half the street lay in shadow . There was one more shop in town which sold oil ; but when they came to it , a bargain was going on and they must wait . Joining the onlookers , they peered within . " He is selling the earth of his floor , " explained Ho . " The tong ja can see it is wet , and that the shoes stick to it as one walks . Now it has value for the fields , or to the maker of gunpowder ; a little saltpeter can be drawn from it , so the owner is selling it . " " A man makes his living in this way , buying the dirt of such floors ! " exclaimed Stephen , realizing how meager must be the money gained from the extracting of saltpeter from the slimy surface . Literally nothing was wasted in this country ! " Ai yah ! It is too much , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gown of thin silk marked with a soiled line down the back . " His queue must have rested there in times long past , " thought Stephen . There was a gray line , too , where the long sleeves were turned back from his thin hands . " You are charging for three inches of earth and there are but two of value , " the man went on indignantly . " Three , I say . " The shopkeeper brought forth a pointed stick . " See , I will loosen it here under your feet , that all may say I speak truly . " " Over in this corner I will dig a little , " answered the buyer . " Perhaps water from the watering pails has fallen where you dig . Ai , less than two inches is wet in this corner ! But I am a just man and I will pay you for two . " " Three , I say . " " Ai yah , it is too much . You will take away my profit . There is leaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must buy . "   " Three . " " And only a little saltpeter when all is finished . Many floors , before I have enough to sell at the gunpowder market . Ai yah , two and a quarter . " " Two and three-quarters . " " Ai ! The paying of my tax ! I forgot the paying of the tax . Ninety cents a month . Two and a half , I will pay , but I make nothing . " The bargaining went on , dragging itself through the afternoon , buyer and seller struggling for the minute profit . At last they agreed on two inches and two-thirds . When night came , what with the slow Eastern politeness and the slow winning of the confidence of shopkeepers , Stephenand Ho were only a little on their way . Stephen had for his day 's harvest of work only the record of the tiny kernels of business of four country villages , and the knowledge that the saltpeter gleaned from old floors made a man a living . Weary with the long drawn-out talk over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front room of the inn where they were staying the night , hopingto find an inner room where he could be alone . In one of a number of cubby-holes , evidently used here in the South for sleeping-places , he found his boy spreading his mattress on a bed frame of woven cords , evil-smelling and filthy . " Take it out quickly , " he commanded . He was looking around for a place to sleep , when Ho joined him . " Tong ja can sleep in the court if he wishes . I have arrangedit . " Stephen hesitated . " But the innkeeper 's shrine is there . He will not object ? " " I have arranged it , " said Ho . After each had eaten his evening meal  --  Ho in the front shop , and Stephen sitting on his cot , a table before him on which his boy had placed a plate of ham and eggs and a great pot of coffee  --  the two men sat together , smoking , in the dimP229courtyard . Ho , in his dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside Stephen , except for two light streaks where his snowy undergarment made little cuffs beyond his sleeves . The bands of white were parallel , showing that Ho 's hands rested on his spread knees . A crowd of villagers which had gathered at the edge of the court , gradually moved nearer until their faces were close to Stephen 's . One man , more bold than the rest , was fingering the cloth of his trousers . At Ho 's words they moved back , but soon they were edging forward again , until once more they were peering into the white man 's face . Stephen toyed with the idea of offering the innkeeper the sum of his evening 's business in the tea-shop , if he would put up the wooden shutters across the open front , shutting out these curious onlookers . He computed the probable returns for the evening . Three ten-cent pieces , small money , would be the top price he would offer . Then he gave it up . It would take half the evening to make the bargain but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much prestige with Ho . He remembered a recent talk , in which he had asked his friend how best to govern the servants of the south . " Tong ja , " Ho had said , " this is the error in your countrymen'sconduct . You send to buy a trifling thing on the street . The coolie returns and counts out the change , lays it before you  --  two silver pieces , a copper and ten cash . Let not the tong ja , as so many of his countrymen , leave the cash for the coolie . The coolie is not grateful . In his heart , the coolie thinks such a man a fool who does not know the value of money . " No , better endure the crowd drawing in once more . He felt that Ho would think him a fool , too , if he should waste money , paying the innkeeper for the evening 's business . But at last the innkeeper drove out the loiterers , slid the wooden shutters into place along the front of his shop . Day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory , visiting every village . The humblest was not neglected . At last they drew near to the city where Ting lived . In more and more shops , they saw the oblong cans of oil bearing the chop of the Keepers of Light  --  two flaming red characters across the top of the large label  --  and beneath a picture of the little lamp , its burning wick turned high , radiatingyellow flanges of light . Ting has indeed been at work . But he shall work even harder , now , said Stephen to himself . As their chairs were carried along the Great Street of the city , they saw the gilt sign of the Company hanging in air above the shop of Ting . Their chairs were brought to rest . Stephen looked up . Ting 's shop was by far the grandestbuilding on the street , two stories high , and its front decoratedwith ornate carvings . Ting , the skirt of his gown shortened in front by his paunch , larger even than in the spring , stood at the door of his inner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ho , urging them to precede him into the room . Seeing him thus against his own background , Stephen recognized that Ting was indeed an important man in the province . Two contending emotions filled Stephen : astonishment over his own daring in treating Ting as he had  --  perhaps if he had realized the man 's position he would not have risked experimenting with him in the matter of face ; pride , that he had saved such a man for the Company . There was no talk of resigning now , even when the new scheme was discussed . " Mr. Ting will have to have more men to do this . " " Hao la , hao la , all right , all right , " replied Ting . He was in excellent humor . His business must have increasedeven more than his reports showed . " Holding back a few sales ; speculating in wood oil , I 'll bet , " was Stephen 's secret thought . " The tai-pan will feast to-night ? " It was while they were feasting in the city 's chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is it to-night that the honorable one would resign ? "   " Very good , very good , tai-pan . I recommend for the Keepers of Light a great merchant . " Ting inclined his head toward a mean little specimen of a man at the next table . " Very good , " answered Stephen solemnly . Ting 's left eye shot up , and he settled himself to his feasting . Through the meal they continued to chaff each other , even Ho occasionally joining in . On a day late in September , Stephen and Ho reached their home city . They were almost at Ho 's gate when the chair coolie swerved suddenly to avoid a kneeling figure . A beggar , Stephen thought , then he saw that it was a young girl who knelt on the stone flagging . She was evidently well born from the cut and material of her short jacket and trousers and the smallness of her feet . She might have been twelve years old , he imagined . With his quick eye for detail , he noticed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braid , the style followed by Chinese women before marriage . Her hair was short and , odder still , curly . He caught a glimpse of her face , the black loose masses of her hair accentuating its paleness . The girl had risen now and a coolie woman , evidently her amah , pulled forward a mat on which her mistress had been kneeling , The young girl took three steps upon her bound feet , then knelt again . " What penance is she doing ? " Stephen wondered . As his chair swung round the corner toward the front of the hong , he looked back , for another thing had struck him about the girl . She was beautiful . He had never before seen beauty in the Chinese . He wanted another glimpse of her , but she had vanished . And in another moment he had forgotten her in his delight over his home-coming . The next morning Stephen called Boynton and Fenton into his office and laid his new plan before them , giving each a territory to cover . " You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . P232Back in their office , the two young men faced each other . Even the loyal Boynton was for the moment nonplussed . Fenton , feeling no reserves , stormed about the office expressinghis criticism . " Well , that finishes him for me . You can say what you like . Just imagine a man at home wasting his time over little sales like that , instead of seeing the big opportunities . Men connected with a Company like this , spending their time over the picayunish buying of the poor ! Why , it 's like the Chinese splitting sunflower seeds with their teeth and pulling out the kernels with their tongues , instead of eating real food ! " Suddenly , the amount of work the project involved occurredto Boynton . " Imagine the patience it 's going to take , the patience of a Chinaman . We 'll be gone for weeks ! " " Well , you 'll see how fast I get it done , " Fenton answered . " I do n't intend staying out longer than . . . Let 's see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from to-day . Must try to make that . Guess I 'll get going this afternoon . I 'll surprise Chase for once , and start sooner than he told me to . " He grinned , rang the bell for the coolie , sending him for his houseboy . " Get my traveling kit ready , savee ? " Hester , in her living-room , arranged and rearranged short sprays of the glossy leafed kwe hwa , sent her as a present from Ho . Coming in through her windows , she heard the high squeak of wheelbarrows , the thin rasping of insects in tiny wooden cages  --  the cicada vender down in the alley  --  and the easily detected cadence of white women 's voices , her neighbors , gathered in a knot down below on the bund . Like an echo from some other scene , their voices reached her . Stepping through the long open window that gave on the gallery , she went to the top of the stairs , looking down into the uplifted faces of three women , and the small oval of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the women called up to her in chorus . " We 're coming up ! " They mounted the stairs , talking and laughing , the little girl in their midst . " We want to hear all about what you 've been doing , " said Mrs. Breckenridge , the tall thin wife of the manager of the British Oil Company , as they entered the room . " Robin wrote that that husband of yours does n't play fair , works all the time . He dare n't take a vacation because of him . " Hester poured tea for her neighbors as they sat in a circle round the tea-table . The kwe hwa gave out its rich and heavy perfume , mingling with the scent of the tea . The crisp blue native linen dress of the consul 's wife made a spot of clear color set between the dun-colored pongee of the other two . The little girl leaned against her mother , looking with bored eyes from face to face , clutching at the conversation of her elders for something a child might enjoy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the mother , pushing the little girl away . " It 's too hot . " She added , " I do n't know what I 'm going to do with her all winter . She has n't a soul to play with , now the Dentons have gone away . Joey was twelve , but he was nice to Geraldine . She 's fretful already , the way a child alone gets in these places . " All four of them looked at the little girl , who stood , staring dully into space . " I do n't see how you stayed here all summer , Mrs. Chase . What 'd you do ? " " It 's been nice , " began Hester . " Nice ? How nice in this heat ? Just tell me that , " one of the women demanded . Hester started to speak , making an effort to explain . Then she stopped , laughing lightly , " I believe I ca n't tell you . I 'm beginning to think it was just because I 'm lazy . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much from what Ted wrote me , " said the commissioner 's wife .   " Well , girls , let 's get down to business , " said Mrs. Stanton , the consul 's wife . " We came to see if you 'd make a fourth at bridge three mornings a week this winter , Mrs. Chase . " Hester hesitated . " Please do say you will . You see we ca n't play if you do n't . You owe it to the community . " When it was arranged to their satisfaction , the three women rose to go . Then the consul 's wife remembered something she had meant to mention to Hester . " You know we heard this summer , while we were in the mountains , that you play beautifully . . . the piano , I think . It 's naughty of you not to have told us . We need everybody'sbit to keep up the spirit of the port . " " Oh , but I do n't , " expostulated Hester . " Really , my dear ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she used to live in the same town with you in Man-churia . " Deftly , Hester changed the subject . She did not want to tell them that she played the violin . When the callers had gone , she turned to watch the outsidecoolie lower the screens of strung reeds at the edge of the gallery , then passed into the darkened center of the room beyond . She gave pleased attention to the house coolie with slow movements pushing a cloth over the high polish of the native varnished floor , erasing the pointed footprints of the neighbors , leaving the space between Hester and himself gleaming like a dark red mirror . Seeing her , the coolie waited to let her pass . His eyes , black and moist as a dog 's , full of the faithful devotion of a dog , raised to Hester 's , became a new pleasure . He moved behind her now , patiently polishingthe piece of floor over which his mistress had just passed . He had restored the gleaming perfection of the mirror , when Hester came in again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Stephen ? " When she had met him in the hall , as he reached the next to the top step of the stairs and she had leaned forward toP235kiss him , her mind had taken hold of some difficulty within him which had not been there in the morning . But she had not spoken then , with the black pitlike descent of the stairs falling away below them , creaking , sighing , with the mysterious life of the hong . " Come in here , " he answered her , passing on into the greater privacy of their bedroom . " I ca n't get their cooperation , not even Boynton 's this time . If they do n't do it with understanding , it wo n't be any good . " " What is it you want them to do , Stephen ? " " I could n't explain it to you , I mean I could n't now . It goes back . . . " " Perhaps if we had them to tiffin , you could make them understand . I 'll send a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scribbling on a leaf of Stephen 's memorandum pad , surrenderingthe joy of this meal alone with her husband to the larger demand of the Company . It seemed not two minutes before they appeared , Boyntonleading , waving a white napkin . " See , Mrs. Chase , for you to speak is for us to obey . We were just starting our own tiffin when your message came . I arose , obeyed . " And he bowed his blond head before her . At first Boynton , in his exaggerated politeness , was as disconcertingto Hester as Fenton in his silent moodiness ; and then a pleasant little thrill shot through her . She was the mistress of the hong . There was deference behind the mockery of Boynton 's speech . As they took their places at the table there was a constrainedmoment . Then Hester began searching out the dissonancesof the group ; the contempt that was Fenton , the bantering rebellion  --  " Oh , I say , have a heart "  --  that was Boynton , the fierce drive that was Stephen , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and lest to Stephen he seem insolent in his cock-sureness , she turned the theme away from business , to allow him to talk of his fiancee in America .   " She 's awfully popular , that girl of mine , " he said . " You know , Mrs. Chase , sometimes I 'm afraid some other man 'll get her before I get back . Of course I want her to be popular , but it 's a whole year yet . Wish I were Boynton : he has only three months more . He 's got the hours worked out . " " Oh , shut up , " said Boynton . " Why , I did n't know you were engaged , " exclaimed Hester . " I am , on and off . It 's on just now . " " Have you written about your leave ? " asked Stephen . " Well , no , " said Boynton . " I thought the Company would let me know when I could be spared . I do n't want to seem too eager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . " " Would you care to have me write ? " asked Stephen after a moment 's hesitation . " I 'd like to keep you here , but I think . . . well , this is something due yourself . " " I 'd be awfully grateful if you would , " said Boynton . " It would come better from you . " Now the conversation swung comfortably back to their work and to the discussed problem . Boynton , sitting at Hester 's right hand , half turned in his chair , forgetting her in his interest in what Stephen was saying . " You see , " Stephen began , " this plan is aimed at making another class of Chinese want light . At the top , the electric light is coming in . That presses the big lamp a little farther down in the economic scale , but not much . The class that can afford it is small . A night 's burning of a big lamp would take a week 's wages of nine-tenths of the people in the valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small tradesmen out in the country districts thinking about light , wanting light . Now , for instance , in Manchuria . Most of the people there had passed through the big cities of the coast on their trek into Manchuria , and they 'd seen cities really lighted . They had a conception of light , and they made chimneyless lamps out of old bottles , even before they had seen our lamp . ToP237get the business I want , you 've got to imagine the state of mind of men who count their day 's business in cash  --  cash , a two-thousandth of a dollar . " Fenton , who had been maneuvering two salt-cellars along a road he had made of a spoon and a knife , looked up , for one moment , giving his will for understanding over to Stephen . Kin gently removed from under his hands the spoon and the fork , setting them in their rightful places . Stephen was leaning forward , forgetting his habitual restraint . " You 've got to understand poverty to succeed , " he concluded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Fenton . " Unfit me for big enterprises . " " If you mean America , " Stephen answered , " men rarely go back ; and if you mean big enterprise in China , there is no such thing , only a multitude of little sales . " " Well , I guess it 's a sound idea , " Boynton conceded . " We 've been shooting too high . " Long before , Hester had let go their talk , her mind idling outside the orbit of their conversation , aware only of the soft stroke of the silk of her sleeve as she moved her arm , and the faint breeze set going by the punka , fanning to coolnessher skin , moist , as the heat of the September day mounted in intensity with the hours . And a new sound , heard for the last hour but hardly noticed , which , by the weight of its repetition at last bore down upon her . " Hai yo-oh , hai yo-oh , High-low-o , high-low-o ! " A great weight thudding down , accenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ho 's begun his foreign house , " said Stephen , breaking into the theme of his own conversation . " The pile-drivers are at work . " Kin came and spoke softly to Hester , telling her a new curio man had come . She made a little shift of her chair , essaying her departure . Stephen looked at his watch and rose quickly .   " I had no idea it was opening time . " For a moment they all paused at the window , looking down at the preparations for Ho 's three-story brick house . A corner of the garden wall had been torn away , a scaffolding of bamboo poles had been erected . Four men stood upon a platform , ropes in their hands . " Hai yo-oh , hai yo-oh . " The human pile-drivers hauled up the enormous wooden hammer , dropped it . " Look at them , millions just like them in this country , little more than animals , " said Fenton . " Do you expect us to make them want light ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market . " As the men went away to their work , Hester knelt by the pack of the pedlar , idly watching him take out his wares . From the events of the morning , the question of her music was thrust forward into her attention . All through the luncheon she had been putting it from her . Why did she not play ? Why could she not play her violin ? Even now when she felt to the point of pain the need for music , she was unable to feed her own hunger . Something hypnotic in the bright hot minutes of the afternoon , empty of endeavor , filled with the little entertainment before her , held her spirit : blue glass beads on yellow cords , bone beads patiently carved with flowers falling on the blue ones , coral flung in a red pile on the top , the bright blue of the kingfishers ' feathers enameled into earrings crowning the mounting heap . Then the beads and the tangled tassels , the bits of brass , the small incense burners bought by the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disfiguring the polished beauty of her floor . " Tell him to take it all away , Kin , " she commanded , pushingfrom her lap a little pile of objects she had half thought she would buy . " Tai-tai , " the old man spoke softly , picking up a clothcoveredgray box , pulling the inch-long bone spear of its fastening thrust through a loop of red braid , " look see . " P239In a shaped space fitting it accurately there lay a perfect piece of porcelain . An artist had made that , Hester knew . An artist of centuries ago , for the making of such porcelains is a lost art . She coveted the vase . Quickly she turned her attention to a vulgar brass image of the Laughing Buddha , cunningly expressed interest in it and none in the treasure she coveted , thinking to lessen its price by her indifference . Kin , watching the old man sitting back on his haunches bargaining with Hester over the LaughingBuddha , detected a slight movement of her hands toward the valuable porcelain . He moved his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there the tai-tai 's interest lay . No , said Hester , she did not want the image . Not good , there were flaws in it . But what of this other thing , this bit of porcelain ? If it were not too dear she might take it . When the curio man stated his price she rose and walked away . " You no wanchee anything ? " he called after her . With a patient sigh , slowly and carefully packing away his trinkets , he raised his pack on his shoulders and went out . But when Hester returned , the bowl stood upon the table where she had planned to place it . When she summoned Kin , asking the reason , he said the man had insisted on leaving it a day for her to look at . He would come again . Suddenly the afternoon was vivid with interest for Hester , a new idea forming in her mind . Everything in this room beautiful , the other rooms too . Things which only the privileged manager 's wife could own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it at any cost . Things beautiful , things to deck the spirit that had refused the travail of creating beauty of sound . In the days that followed , with excited energy she offered her spirit one lovely thing after another . P240DAY by day Ho 's foreign house grew taller , the scaffolding of bamboo poles , tied together with hempen strands , standing so high that the red flags on their tips , placed there to keep away the devils , floated level with Hester 's windows . The red brick walls were a floor high , and down in the alley the apprentices , through the slow hours of the day , trod water into the cement . Thin stockings of gray formed on their legs ; their chant took the place of the heavy chant of the pile-drivers , boys ' voices , sleepy , soft , and sometimes shrill ; A ha , a ha , Six years we workFor our masters . A ha , a ha , His old trousers to wear in the summer , A padded coat in winter ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's business , Ho spoke , " Tong ja , there is a little matter that pertains to my family . " Stephen was startled into attention . Ho speaking of his family to him , who had never been beyond the garden of the great house ! " The wife of my third son . . . " Ho considering his daughter-in-law ! There was a change coming over him since the death of his old mother . First the foreign house , and now speaking to Stephen of the women of his household . Occasionally Ho had spoken of this or that son . His oldest son , Stephen knew , was a disappointment ; and that the third son was his favorite . Once Ho had brought this third son to the office . He had seemed an odd mix- P241ture of gentleman and coolie ; a thin face , aristocratic in shape , the mouth heavy and the nose as flat as a negro 's , the nose of a coolie . But the eyes were what impressed Stephen  --  honest , faithful eyes , strangely revealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son was tall , too , like his father . Stephen wondered what the wife of this boy of seventeen would be like . " My son talks of the school in the city where girls learn . Day and night , he does not cease to speak of it for his wife . It seems it is becoming the custom . Perhaps good , perhaps not good . He wishes her to learn your speech . " Stephen was silent for a moment . Possibly here was a chance to return Ho 's kindness to him ; here too , Hester 's opportunity to know the women of his friend 's family . Perhapsthis was what Ho desired now . Friendship between the two families . " Teacher , " Stephen said at last , " I do not know your custom , and whether it would be pleasing to you , but my wife could teach the woman our speech . She reads and writes . " There was a long silence and no answer . Ho rose and , after formal salutation , went away . But after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was happy that he could do this thing for Ho ; and happy , too , that Hester was to have her desire . For three afternoons of sunshine Hester held herself ready to receive Ho 's daughter-in-law . Each day Kin brought her word that her pupil was coming , then that there were affairs at home and it could not be arranged . On the third day , weary of waiting , Hester went in where her amah sat by the window in the guest-room sewing , and talked to her about the matter . Amah did not lift her eyes from her work , but Hester felt there was knowledge in them , for about amah 's mouth played the faintest of knowingsmiles . Hester was baffled and annoyed , feeling that she had some right to knowledge of the delay , a knowledge which every one else seemed to possess .   That night , while they were seated at dinner , she asked her husband if he would not speak to Ho , but Stephen said Ho had unexpectedly gone away that very day on some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discourteous to force an explanation , " he added . " It seems to me , " said Hester , " that it 's discourteous to me , to keep me waiting . " " Not in the eyes of the Chinese , " answered Stephen . " Probably it 's their lack of sense of time , that 's causing the delay . Time to them is not split apart into small units , as it is to us . " Hester was almost persuaded , when , looking up , she caught the ghost of a smile playing around Kin 's mouth , like that she had seen around amah 's . Kin was serving at the time , and his eyes were lowered as anah 's had been . She felt uneasiness rising within her , remembering that night in Manchuria when they had waited in vain for the agent to escort them to the feast . Was she again the recipient of Oriental insult ? She began to feel herself losing the footing she had gained in this Oriental world  --  again that dwindling of personality so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no idea of insulting the wife of Ho 's friend . Neither was there indifference to the hour set for the lesson . The matter had taken on too great importancefor that . Not since the death and burial of the old mother had emotion swept with such vehemence through the courts of the Ho household , although for some time a storm had been brewing . Since the death of the old tai-tai , new contents and discontentsstirred the courts . The eldest son of Ho had been the darling of his grandmother . At thirty , he was effeminate , loitering in the courts of the women , a man given to many women , squandering the clan 's money in gambling at mah jong . Only the commands of the old tai-tai had kept Ho on several occasions from beating him with bamboos . But now , no longer could this waster make free with thep243family money . His father governed him strictly , and when Ho had gone on the long trip of investigation with Stephen , he had placed the money affairs in the hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trip , his house apparently was filled with the quietness and peace of Oriental seclusion , very satisfying after the weeks of travel , travel which , as to most Chinese , had been anathema to him . The lanterns had been lighted in the courts , and , as Ho 's chair coolies carried his chair through the gate , there was the scurrying of servants ' feet , and the cry echoing through the courts , " The master comes ! The master comes ! " In the ancestral hall , there was quiet reverence . The food had been placed for the old matriarch 's use . It added a homelike air . Outside the apartments of Ho 's head wife , the table for the children was spread . There was the soft hubbubof their voices , the subdued laughter of their amahs . The servants came to him , bringing steaming cloths for his face , hot food and his water-pipe . And then , with a loud sigh of satisfaction , Ho had stretched himself out on the clean and tautly laced brown string mattress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillow , as he commanded the servant to loosen the bed curtains from the brass hooks which held them back . He would sleep a little before the evening salutations of his family . But the peace which lay over the courts was brittle with the tension of jealousy . The first son 's wife sat in the doorwayof her court where she could see all who went forward toward the room of her father-in-law , and all who went to her mother-in-law 's private apartment . There was restraintin her dress and in her posture , but in her face the hunted look of one strained to the breaking point . In the court nearest to the head lady 's , the widow of Ho 's second son awaited the return of her sons from their eveningmeal . A little boy skipped gaily through the doorway into the court.  | " Where is thy elder brother ? " asked his mother . " The old one desired him , " he said , tying the skirts of his coat into his silk girdle and getting out his diabolo . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was gaining in favor daily . She , a widow , must depend upon these sons to give her position in the family . All she did that was asked of her , all and more  --  her girl-child performing this extra sacrifice at the temple . The third son 's wife , Still-Water  --  she who had brought down wrath upon herself that day she played where the white barbarians could hear her  --  she , too , was thinking of her father-in-law 's return . As a sweet taste in her mouth , she savored her newly exalted place in the household  --  her husband , the one handling the money in the master 's absence . The next afternoon , the third son of Ho came from the apartment of his father well pleased . In return for his satisfactory handling of the money , his father had granted the thing he had desired . He went directly to his wife , Still-Water , telling her she was to go to the Keepers of Light for the new learning . Still-Water pouted a little . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to study now . Why should this be asked of her ? Her amah , leaning between the pair to pour a little tea and set down the dish of sweetmeats , exclaimed : " Ai , my lady privileged among all the ladies of the household . Her face is very great ! " Then she went away , spreading the news through the courts . As she had hoped , word of it was carried to the wife of the first son , who lay down immediately , drawing the curtains of her bed together . Tears fell from her eyes , and over and over she said to herself , " Favor again for that silly Still-Water . Ai , I eat bitterness ! I eat bitterness ! " Toward evening , she was sick with the bitterness she had eaten and her flesh put forth fire . But she rose to obey a command of the mother of her husband , her ruler . She dared not send word that she was sick . She was hated byp245her husband 's mother because she had never borne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her husband 's concubines might be given her place . Feeling too weak to walk alone , leaning on her amah as she went toward the head lady 's apartments , the wife of the first son met the amah of StillWatercoming chattering forth from the court of the widow of the second son . Then the first son 's wife felt black rage rising within her and she slapped Still-Water 's amah , shouting at her to stop her foolish talk about her great face . Amah , blubbering noisily , hurried away to her mistress and set up a loud wailing , telling Still-Water what the wife of the first son had done to her . " Insulting you through me ! " wailed amah . Then Still-Water went to see the first son 's wife , and they berated each other . Anger ebbed and flowed through the courts . Ai yah , it was a fine drama . The servants of the household took sides , some with the first son 's wife , some with the third son 's wife . Even into the garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarrel was carried . The servant who brought tea told the master , speaking in such wise that the white man did not grasp the meaning . Stephen , looking at his friend , immobile of countenance , wondered if the way of life of the East did not offer more serenity than that of the West  --  this quiet garden , the shelteredcourts beyond . Ho , who had not been at all certain that education among the women was a good thing , decided now that it was not , and sent formal summons that evening to his third son to come to his apartment , telling him it was better that the women change their ways . The next morning word was brought that his third son 's wife was very ill , having put forth great fire . It was wise not to oppose her , for there was hope that she was soon to have a son . Then Ho decided he would go away for a little meditation , and leave the affair to settle itself . Had the matriarch , Ho 's mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her favorite wished , but the wife of Ho could never decide between her three sons . Anotherday the battle raged , even the little boys of the householdslipping away from their teacher to peep into the court of the first son 's wife , where Still-Water rocked herself back and forth , insisting she was going to the foreign house , and the first son 's wife , calling her names , said she should not . Now the ten-year-old daughter of the dead second son , who had long wished to study with the boys of the householdand had been refused , came and stood up bravely between the two angry women , making herself a go-between . " If I , this little insignificant one , lowest in the families of the sons of Ho , should be sent with the third son 's wife , the honor of learning would be shared with the second son 's widow , my mother . Then neither the wife of the youngest , or the oldest son triumphs to the full . " " It is a good compromise , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said every one . Then all at once the rage between the two women had spent itself . " It is now the hour to go , " said the little girl , pressing her advantage ; and , after smoothing the hair of Still-Water and putting rice powder on her face , she led her forth . " They come , they come , " announced Kin . Hester saw entering the room not one but two young girls , holding hands as if to give courage , each to the other . Their tiny feet struck the floor with the clump , clump of padded sticks raised and lowered , raised and lowered . They sat side by side on two straight chairs Kin placed for them , their amah attending them , standing behind . " At last ! " Hester said to herself . " After four years in this country am I to know its women ? " The older girl 's face did not interest her . It was heavy and expressionless . She did not know that it was dulled by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ho 's household . The younger girl was fascinating . The child sat squarely on her chair , a humorous likeness in her attitude to that of Ho himself . Behind her composure , Hester was aware of magnetic power and a strong will . This girl must play a big part in the Ho household , maybe the favorite child . " What is your name ? " Hester asked . " Shiao Pao , Little Precious . " Ah , she was right ; the little girl was a favorite . Now Hester began the lesson , leading the girls about the room , to chair and table and window , telling them the foreign words . The news spread through the hong that women from the household of Ho were in the house . The word reached Stephen . Two ? He had arranged for only one , the wife of the third son . Who was the other ? Filled with curiosity to know what the women of Ho 's household were like , he went up the stairs , passed by the open door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark hall , he could see and not be seen . They were facing him . Why , one was the girl he had seen kneeling in the street , the little girl with the black hair waving about her face , like a child of his own race . That strangely appealing figure had been on pilgrimagefrom the Ho household ! How little after all he understoodHo 's life ! P248KEYED higher and higher were the days for Stephen ; the business was beginning to grow . But coupled with the excitement of success , was the fear of threatened failure . This fear was not long absent from his mind . Through letters , telegrams and the " grapevine telegraph " made up of the Chinese of the Company , it traveled to him : a young man , marrying before his two years were up , dropped from the Company ; a man on leave , talking too much to newspaper men , had not returned to his post ; a manager who had exceededhis authority , another who had lost money for the Company , returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the demands of the Company , strivingto make good in his first managership . Now that dreaded thing " squeeze , " not only had not been checked , but was taking on formidable proportions at the tanks . If he could not check it , it might cost him his position . Each morning he went to the telephone , calling McBain , the Scotchman in charge , and each day the answer was the same . The oil was disappearing and right before his eyes ! Yet how ? Day after day , as soon as the office was closed , Stephen made the two-mile journey to the tanks . There were four huge gray tanks here , and two longslantingroofed godowns , where machines took the great sheets of tin plate , fashioning them into the oblong cans . These were placed on a revolving platform , the oil flowed into them , the seal of the Keepers of Light was soldered into the opening . The men in the filling-room sat naked to the waist . What place of concealment had they ? The long lines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their poles , jog-trotted their loads to junks waiting at the pontoon . No receptacle other than the sealed tins passed P249the guards without being challenged . Even the cook 's basket was examined each morning when he went to market for the McBains . And yet the oil was disappearing . Things like this were blots on a man 's record , the Scotchman'srecord , Stephen 's record . The long autumn tarried in the fields and in the town , a slow march of days of sunshine and haze , of kwe hwa passing , chrysanthemum buds swelling ; the fields after the two harvests of rice , plowed into furrows , planted with the winter crops of clover and vegetables , renewing the habitual green of the valley , flowing like a green sea around the fortress of oil from which , despite its strong walls , its guards , the oil continued to trickle away . The quiet of late afternoon lay over the countryside . Stephen and McBain , long in consultation , came from the Scotchman 's office , waiting for Hester and Mrs. McBain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephen watched them passing between the tanks . How tiny they looked walking between the great towers ! Mrs. McBain 's voice drifted to him . " Please stay for dinner . You owe it to us , Mrs. Chase . It 's as lonely as a lighthouse down here . And now with this trouble hanging over us . . . " Hester hesitated . She did n't like the place ; she did n't want to see night come down over this isolated spot , giving her a picture of the McBains shut away by the darkness and the walls . But the pleading in the other woman 's voice was too marked ; she could not say no . The four walked to the gate , Stephen giving the order for his launch to come back later . They stood watching the last of the workmen , the coolies , moving toward the gate , going home for the night . In a moment now , they would all be gone . There was no sound except frogs croaking in a pond outside the wall , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , their round bamboo carrying poles slung across their shoulders , no tins suspended from the ends now.  |p250Suddenly  Mrs. McBain gripped Stephen 's arm , whispering excitedly , " Mr. Chase , Mr. Chase , look at them ! Something'swrong . Stop them ! Stop them ! " she cried to the guard . Stephen thought she had lost her wits , then in a flash he saw what she had seen . Why had he not noticed it himself ? Each man walked under his carrying pole as if it had weight ; and yet bamboo was hollow and had little weight . " Guards , close the gates ! " commanded Stephen . And to the coolies , " Give me your poles . " Out of the cluster of coolies , one advanced and laid his pole in Stephen 's outstretched hands . Examining it , he found at the end a cunningly contrived opening and , when he drew out the plug , oil trickled out , falling in a little pool on the gravel path . In that very moment of delight over finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss from so small a leak . The reason came to him , why he had not found out before  --  he had been looking for something larger . Would he ever learn from these people how much the small things counted ? " I 'll be damned ! " cried McBain . " But how 'd they get it in , without our seeing them ? " " That will probably remain a mystery , " said Stephen . When the gate was opened the coolies slunk away quickly , going home disgraced now in the eyes of the village . To be detected in squeeze ! And the extra revenue gone from the village ! Within the walls of the fortress of light , the four gathered around the dinner table in celebration , a bottle of special wine opened by McBain . The fear gone now , the blot on the men 's records erased . " The first toast must be to Mrs. McBain ! " said Stephen . " We should n't know now , if it were n't for her . " Spots of color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get away from her part in the affair . " You see , " she kept saying , " it just came to me all of a sudden what it was . " The next morning , Stephen came running up the stairs to Hester , a letter in his hand , crying , " News ! Boynton 's got his home leave and the Burnhams are being sent here . " " Oh , how nice ! " cried Hester . She 'd never forgotten Elsie Burnham and the way she had slipped her hands into hers . And Elsie had written her after the baby came , telling her it had been all right , just as Hester said it would be . Elsie and the baby coming here . " But Stephen , I thought Burnham was a manager . " " Well , he 's had a little bad luck , so they 're sending him here for a while , " he answered . They looked at each other , the same thought in both their minds  --  suppose Mrs. McBain had n't found out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Boynton 's departure , the day of the Burnhams arrival , Stephen was checked as he passed the door of Boynton'sold apartment by the sound of Hester singing . A trill of high notes fell from her lips without effort , bubbling up like a bright spring from some source within her . It was the first time he had heard Hester singing in the hong . Vaguely , through the tense and absorbing interest of his own struggle , he wondered about it as he pushed open the door to see what she was about . She was looping back the heavy Soochow curtainsfrom the long windows . These curtains , part of the equipment of every Company house , heavy and coarse as an ingrain carpet , defied her deft fingers . As he watched , this woman , so intimately dear to him , seemed unknown . Why had she not sung before , why did she sing now ? And then , disturbing in its vivid reality , came the memory of Hester long ago in Manchuria disclosing to him the secrecy of her heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she been so lonely that she did not sing ? Did Elsie Burnham 's coming mean so much to her ?   When , for the third time , the cumbersome material fell away from her hands , he went over to her . " Can I help ? " he asked . " But why tire yourself like this ? Why not let Kin do it ? " " I do n't know , really , " she said . " I had some sort of idea of making the place more homelike for Elsie Burnham by doing this myself . " She spoke a little ruefully , looking at the unruly curtain . " Absurd , really , as if it would make any difference whether I did it or Kin . " She was facing him , standing against the brown curtain , the darker brown pattern of bamboos stretching away into the dim high top of the room . Stephen looked deep into her eyes . " Hester , " he asked , " are you happy ? " " Why , yes , Stephen . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new understanding . Her eyes , held to his by the intensity of his gaze , saw into the innermost place of his heart , saw that she was its occupant , given every delicate offering in this place so secret , so guarded that the door , perhaps only in this moment , would ever swing in for her recognition of her presence within . If she could only remember when the door swung to . Into the charmed moment broke the whistle of a steamer . With one motion of his hands , Stephen swept back the curtains . The wooden rings slid along the curtain poles with a wooden clack . The spell was broken , his thoughts back again in the groove of work . " It 's the steamer , " he said . " We 'll have to hurry if we meet the Burnhams . " Looking through the window that gave on the alley , he caught a glimpse of Ho walking carefully across the white flooring boards of the second floor of his new house , and he heard the apprentices at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The cotton padding in my coat is thin ... " OIL FOR THE LAMPS OF CHINA 253P253The breakfast was done , Stephen had gone away to his office . Against the long windows fell the fine sheets of rain  --  indication that autumn was ended . Above the noise of the coolie raking out the huge stove in the hall , Kin patting the pillows on the bed , amah coming up from her morning meal sighing audibly , settling to her work , Hester heard a door shut on the floor below , the clatter of Elsie 's mules clop , cloppingon the stairs , and Elsie , as she came , singing a popular song . Then she was there , entering the room with a hop and a skip like some pretty gamin . Her baby was tucked into the hollow of one arm and under the other a box of chocolates . Amah trailed behind , complaining , " Missie , pay me small baby . You no savee . True must sleep . " And Elsie , laughing . " Oh , go away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to enjoy him my own way . Go and eat your chow , amah . " She curled herself into a big chair , settling the baby beside her . " Is n't he marvelous , Hester ? He knows better than to cry , or I 'd give him to fat annab . " " Ai yab , " amah wailed , " I come back chop chop . Then you pay me small baby . " " Elsie looks like a pretty child with her doll , " thought Hester , when amah had gone , stooping to pull the corner of a pink blanket into a little peak over the downy head of the baby , hardly knowing whether the exquisite sense of protectionshe felt was for him , or for her friend who looked up now with a gay smile . Perfectly happy , was Hester 's verdict , not knowing that this was a valiant gaiety of Elsie 's , shutting out the humiliating thought that they would not be here if her husband had not failed . " Now , let 's talk , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to talk . You see , up-river was nice enough in some ways , prettier than here , hills all around us . But sometimes for days I did n't see any one except the servants . Every one in the foreign community lived on a different hill , or across the river in the city . But it was all right about the baby , just as you said it would be . How 'd you know , Hester ? You do n't mind if I call you Hester , do you , even if your husband is boss around here ? " Then she was smitten by her own words and fell silent . " It would be dreadful to have you call me anything else . I loved you the first day I saw you . " Hester fell silent too , made uneasy by this revelation of herself which took her out of that world where she dwelt separate from all save Stephen . Then the warmth of friendship ran into her heart and she swept on into confession . " I worried , after I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know why I told you that , because you see  --  I was n't  --  sure . My baby died up in Manchuria . At home he would n't have . " Only the sound of the rain driving in sheets against the long windows . Elsie , with a little rush , was kneeling beside Hester , her baby on one arm , the other thrown round her friend . " My dear , I did n't know . " " Do n't tell any one , " said Hester hastily . " So you see , I have no honor in the eyes of the Chinese . " " But surely you do n't care about that ! " exclaimed Elsie . " What does it matter what they think ? " " It used not to matter but I suppose it must now  --  the way I 've spoken to you , " said Hester . The anzab came now , bearing down upon Elsie like a ship in full sail , the skirt of her short white gown blowing out behind . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savee . Pay he bath , pay he chow , pay he sleep . " When Elsie was once more in her own part of the hong , she threw herself on her bed , crying her heart out . At last she sat up , dabbing at her eyes , putting her hands to her ears to shut out the incessant cries of laborers coming up from the bund and the streets of the city . Why had sheP255been so disturbed over the fact that Hester , the manager 's wife , almost a stranger to her , had lost her baby out here  --  lost it because she was beyond the reach of the help she would have had at home ? It seemed so dreadful for them to be stranded here . Some vague understanding came to her of why she had cried . Hester , herself , her husband , Mr. Chase  --  even he in his success  --  the sports of fortune . She had come bent on adventure , now she knew where the adventureled . Sacrifices like Hester 's , humiliations like her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their living . Well , whatever it cost her it was worth it if that young man she heard crying in his tub was properly cared for . She got up and opened the door into the bathroom . The moist hot air rushed out at her . In the corner was the round green pottery tub in which she had sat that morning , like a Buddha , for her bath . Above it , suspended from the ceiling , hung an oil tin , a sprinkler spout soldered into the bottom  --  their shower bath . An oil stove burning brightly had eaten up the oxygen in the air , making Elsie gasp . A small tin basin stood on a stool beside amah . On a towel spread across amah 's thighs , well cushioned by her padded winter trousers , lay Dee-dee , naked for his bath . " Plenty fat , Dee-dee . " " I 'll bathe him , " said Elsie . " And put out the stove . How many times have I told you to use plenty of water , amah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Protesting , amah surrendered the baby , and went away grumbling . " Sin of waste , water wasted . So much to drink in the next world in punishment . " " Bye , Baby Bunting , Daddy 's gone a-hunting , " sang Elsie . " To get a pretty rabbit-skin , to wrap his darling baby in ! " Into the Narrow House discord came . From the day of his arrival , Burnham flushed hotly whenever Stephen gave him an order , a flush of humiliation and resentment . Chase ought to recognize the fact that he had been a manager himself . Probably only temporary , this being put back into the ranks . P256If he could have it out with Chase , if Chase would tell him . . . well , why he was here . He could explain about those defaults . He was not to blame . It might have happened to any one . Just bad luck ; surely he could make Chase see that . He went over in his mind how he would present the matter to Chase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company had not told Burnham what they had told Stephen , that they considered him too easy-going ; the Chinese could hoodwink him . They had sent him to Chase to whip into shape , passing the burden of discipline and possible illwillfrom the Company to the individual . When Stephen had received the letter telling him to work Burnham hard , he had held it in his hand for a long time . Not a pleasant task . Should he make any mention to Burnham of the letter ? The Company surely had informed him why he was here . Perhaps they should thrash the matter out between them . But no ! Unnecessary to cause Burnham to lose face . That would make the situation intolerable for him . It was sufficient that the man knew why he was here , Stephen concluded , putting the letter in his private file . But as the days went by and there was no understanding between them , Stephen decided to give Burnham a bit of independent work . Lin , the agent he had never trusted , was in arrears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a task where he could be on his own . Putting confidence in him might lead to a better understanding . A week later Stephen glanced from his office window , hearingthe last forced-out groaning note of the chair coolies , as they lowered from their shoulders the weight of a man . Burnhamreturning ! Stephen 's lips set in a stern line . " You 're to stay until you get the money , " he had said . No remittance had come in from Lin . As Burnham went past the office to the stairs that led to his apartment , Stephen hailed him.  | " Just a moment , Burnham . " The other man turned , his hand on the stair post , looking up toward Elsie and Dee-dee . " After I 've seen the family and cleaned up I 'll be down . " " I want to see you now . " A moment , Joe Burnham hesitated . Elsie , Dee-dee in her arms , fell back into the shadows above , and her husband strode into Stephen 's office . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've had no re-mittance . " " I 've used my best judgment , " answered Burnham . " I think everything 's all right . " " I did not ask you what you thought , " said Stephen , " I asked you if you had the money . " Burnham 's eyes fell . " He said he 'd remit . " " And you believed him ? " Stephen 's words had the cold cut of scorn . He remembered Lin 's shifty look -- it had been his own first reading of character in a Chinese . Could n't Burnham see that Lin was n't to be trusted ? Burnham , who had been born in this country ? " Why should n't I trust his word ? " Burnham 's humiliation and resentment of weeks flared into defiance of Stephen . " I believe in trusting them if you do n't . " " It is n't a question of trusting the Chinese . You want to look at them as individuals . Lin could n't be trusted , whateverrace he belonged to . Besides it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's I who will have to take the blame , if he defaults . " Stephen 's words sounded harsh and arbitrary to Burnham , justifying him in his feeling of superiority . There came to his mind the delicate attention of the agent , the inference that the man preferred to deal with him rather than with Stephen . He turned and left the office . For forty days the sun did not shine , the gray city lay under the gray pall of the semi-tropic sky , and a misty
