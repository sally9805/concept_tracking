txt A broad plan for the establishment of State systems of unemployment insurance is outlined in a report of a commission of experts named by the Governors of six large industrial States , made public here today . The commission , which is headed by Leo Wolman , was chosen last year when Governor Roosevelt invited to Albany the executives of Massachusetts , Rhode Island , Pennsylvania , Ohio , New Jersey and Connecticut . The other members of the commission are Charles R. Blunt of New Jersey , A. Lincoln Filene of Massachusetts , C. A. Kulp of Pennsylvania , W. M Leiserson of Ohio and W. J. Couper of Connecticut . Compulsory formation of unemployment reserve organizations based on payment by each employer of two per cent of his payroll are urged in ithe report . The per cent is to be re1 duced to one when the accumulated reserve for each worker reaches $50 . Each firm 's or company 's payment to the unemployment fund would serve as its own reserve and would not be put in a common pool . This method , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from drawing upon the pool at times when there was no general unemployment . The maximum benefit to be paid to a displaced worker would be $10 a week , or 50 per cent of an employe 's wage , whichever is lower . This is to be for only ten weeks in any one year . The commission advises the immediate creation of an unemployment administration of three members to represent labor , industry and the public . In proposing that contributions to the fund be made by the employer and not the employe the commission says that the worker should not " be required to reduce his earnings " by payment of a contribution and adds that the employer 's " financial liability under the plan would operate as a continuous Incentive to prevent unemployment as far as practicable . " Gov . Roosevelt WM Move for Plan . Governor Roosevelt hailed the report in a statement issued in conjunction with its release for publication , and said that he would move at once to ask the New York Legislature to take action in accordance with the findings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the representatives of these States have been able to present a unanimous report favoring unemployment reserves . " I heartily agree with the commission that unemployment reserves , as outlined in their report , will go far toward dealing with the pressing need for a solution to the problem of unemployment . " This plan is sound and carefully safeguarded . It would make provision for irregularity of industrial operation , give incentives for regularization of industry and maintain the morale and self-respect of the worker , so essential among the citizens of a democracy . It contains a radical departure from all European plans in that it definitely avoids the comingling of a reserve and relief funds , recommending that the payments of each employer constitute his reserves and not be turned into a common pool . " I congratulate the members of the commission on this careful and constructive piece of work . I shall transmit it at once to the Legislature of the State of New York , and trust it will receive widespread and careful study and will result in legislation which will mitigate the sufferings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our citizens to an avoidance of such cataclysms.
