Despite President Roosevelt , there was evidence last week that the U. S. is returning to horse &; buggy days . In Huntingburg , Ind. , President Herman Heitman of Huntingburg Wagon Works ( largest in the U. S. ) announced : " The Depression did n't affect us in the least and today we are expanding . Present trends indicate a decided increase in business for 1937 . " <P> Buggyman Heitman has 80 men working six days and three nights a week . Last year they turned out 9,000 wagons and 3,000 buggies by hand . More than half were sold in Louisiana , where descendants of French Acadians dislike automobiles . The bearded , button-shunning Amish Mennonites of Pennsylvania also give Herman Heitman much business . Explained he last week : " The Amish people are unalterably opposed to ostentation in any form . " <P> There are only 14 buggy-makers left in the U. S. and only three besides Huntingburg are important . J. G. Smith &; Sons of Barnesville , Ga . who claim to be the only buggymen below the Mason &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Louisiana . Their business is up 50% this year . Houghton Sulky Co. of Marion , Ohio , specializes in horse-show buggies and racing sulkies , do not make ordinary " top " buggies . Unwilling to reveal figures , Houghton last week confirmed the current boom . Biggest exclusive buggy-maker is Standard Vehicle Co. of Lawrenceburg , Ind . Almost ruined by the recent Ohio River floods , it has farmed out all its buggy business to Huntingburg pending repairs . <P> A good rubber-tired buggy with fancy paint costs $125 . Buggymen sell to foreign government officials , who usually like them gaudy ; to places like Bermuda and Mackinac where automobiles are prohibited ; and to parts of the U. S. where roads are bad and people poor . Standard 's president E. J. Knapp likes to tell of a sale in the South where a three-year-old Ford brought $12 , a 30-year-old buggy $17.
