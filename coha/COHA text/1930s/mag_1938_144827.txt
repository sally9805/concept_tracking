THE DARK RIVER-Charles Nordhoff &; James Norman Hall - Little , Brown ( $2.50 ) . <P> A mothers ' proverb , referring to boys ' chores , says that " Two boys are only half a boy . " This saying applies also to most literary collaborations , even to those of such individually able collaborators as were Joseph Conrad and Ford Madox Ford . To Tahiti-Expatriates Nordhoff &; Hall , who in 18 years have collaborated on eight books , it applied least in their H. M. S. Bounty trilogy , where they followed a true story , applies most in The Dark River , where they follow their imaginations , the Satevepost ( where this story ran serially ) and Hollywood . <P> The story centres on the relation between whites and natives . In an isolated valley in Tahiti , 16 years before the story opens , a young English widow , mother of a four-year-old son , dies while giving birth to a girl . A native woman bears a still-born child at the same time , steals the white girl , whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From England , when Naia is 16 , comes her real brother and his friend , tall , grey-eyed Alan Hardie , a promising young scientist , son of a stiff-necked general . Hardened Melodramatists Nordhoff &; Hall are careful to keep these complications from turning into a story of incest , end their tale with the marriage of Naia and Alan , their shipwreck on a deserted island , rescue , tragedy . <P> Although The Dark River has the conventional writing and characterizations of melodramatic fiction and introduces an unusual number of picturesque poses ( silhouettes atop sea cliffs , arm-around-tree pensiveness ) , it still rates above the average South Sea island romance . This may be credited , not to its authentic setting-most popular fiction nowadays has that-but rather to its authors ' genuine sympathy for native Tahitians.
