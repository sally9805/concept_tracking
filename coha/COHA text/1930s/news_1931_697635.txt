txt Groundwork for evidence expected to be presented to the grand jury that officers of the Bank of United States had conspired to keep from the directors and did keep from them knowledge of the precarious condition of the bank at the time when it was moving toward collapse . was developed by Max D. Steuer at yesterday 's session of the open hearings conducted by him for the Attorney General . The evidence was that while the officers had in their possession official reports of the State Banking Department severely criticizing the condition and conduct of the bank they had painted before the directors glowing pictures of the situation and thus misled them into an undue optimism . By this action , according to the evidence , the officers of the bank precluded any timely intervention by the directors which might have saved the institution . Hedley Charges Deception . The direct charge that Bernard K. II Marcus , with the apparent tacit assent of other officers , had misrepresented the bank 's actual condition to the directors was made by Frank Hedley , a member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rapid Transit Company . That Mr. Marcus and his fellow-officers conspired to deceive the directors was charged by Herman A. Metz , also a director of the bank . Mr. Metz , a chemicals manufacturer , is a former Controller of the city of New York . Both Mr. Hadley and Mr. Metz showed themselves to be ignorant of some of the bank 's most important affairs , but pleaded in extenuation that they had relied in the main upon the officers of the bank and that their confidence had been abused . Mr. Hedley said he resigned from the board on Nov. 25 , 1930 , slightly more than two weeks before the bank closed , because information on the merger then under negotiation with the Manufacturers Trust Company on conditions that aroused his suspicion had been refused him . , The evidence with respect to the alleged deception practiced upon the directors corroborated the previous testimony of other directors , including George S. Carr and George C. Van Tuyl Jr. , who were also questioned yesterday . Goes Before Grand Jury Feb. 25 . It was learned that Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury upon its reconvocation on Feb. 25 , together with a mass of other material on which indictments will be sought . Six indictments against eight officers and directors of the bank , including Mr. Marcus , Saul Singer , executive vice president , and Isidor J. Kresel , attorney and director , have already been found . Intimations of fraud by officers of the bank in making loans to affiliates totaling $28,000,000 in defiance of protests by the executive committee were made by Mr. Steuer dur- misleading report to the directors and his own failure as a director to keep himself acquainted with the ac -- tual situation of the bank was : " . All I can say is that the people who ' knew about it were conspiring to keep it from us and did keep it from us . That 's all I can say . " Mr. Hedley told Mr. Steuer that he relied for his information as to the condition of the bank chiefly on Mr. Mitchell and Robert Adamson , a director , in both of whom he said he had implicit confidence and whom he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hedley testified he had absolutely no knowledge of the managers ' syndicate operated . by Mr. Marcus and Mr. Singer for trading in bank stock . " I knew nothing of the syndicate until I was amazed to read about it in the papers , " said Mr. Hedley . " Why amazed ? " inquired Mr. Steuer . " Because I do not believe that officers of a corporation have any right to speculate in stock of that corporation , " replied Mr. Hedley . Mr. Hedley testified also that he knew nothing of the letter sent out to depositors by Mr. Marcus on July 6 , 1929 , announcing a bargain sale of the bank 's stock , a sale which netted $6,000,000 and resulted eventually in heavy losses to depositors . He said he learned of this letter only recently . He pleaded ignorance on the bank 's huge loans to affiliates , although a director of the Bankus Corporation , and , like other witnesses , said that he had understood that Bankus owned the City Financial and Municipal Financial Corporation , a point which Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the $12,000,000 loans to these affiliates actually went to Bankus . Explains His Resignation . Asked . why he resigned from the directorate of the bank , Mr. Hedley explained that in November , 1930 , he had heard that negotiations were under way for merging the bank with the Manufacturers Trust Company on conditions which would dispose of the bank 's stock at from $10 to $20 , stock which had been quoted at $200 . His efforts to obtain definite information as to the negotiations proved . fruitless , Mr. Hedley said . " I concluded there must be something wrong with - the organization and I resigned , " he . declared . Pressed by Mr. Steuer to elaborate on this point , Mr. Hedley said : " I went to Adamson and I said , ' Bob , what 's this all about ? Tell me about this merger . What 's the stock going in for ? ' He said , ' Frank , I do n't know ? ' Then I used a few strong words . " " Tell us what you said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Mr. Hedley . " I said , Bob , this is a hell ' of a situation . I 'll be damned if I am going , along with you fellows any longer . ' Mr. Hedley said that the letter of resignation he had sent soon , after this conversation had never been answered . Asked by Mr. Steuer why he had not inquired from Mr. Kresel , who had been conducting the negotiations for the merger , Mr. Hedley replied that he regarded Mr. Kresel highly but . that he just did n't happen to ask him . " Looking back at it now , " asked Mr. Steller , " do you think you gave the depositors fair representation on the board ? " " I have a clear conscience about It , " replied Mr. Hedley . " Did n't you realize that you were placed on that board because your name would carry weight ? " Mr. Steuer inquired , suggesting that Mr. Hedley , like Mr. Metz and others , had been placed on the board for the purposes of " window dressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but I 've been called everything a man could be called in New York City . " " Did n't you feel any responsibility ? " Mr. Steuer pressed . " Yes , but I expected the officers with whom I was associated to give the true low-down on what was going on , " was the reply . " The impression you make on me , " admonished Mr. Steuer , " is that you did nothing except listen to Marcus and Singer and let it go at that . " " If I had known the true condition of things I would have raised hell , " retorted Mr. Hedley . " The reports were concealed by the officers of the bank . " Lost $50,000 in flank Stock . Before leaving the stand Mr. Hedley revealed that he had lost $50,000 on stock of the , bank and that he had $5,000 on deposit when the bank closed . He said he carried at times as much as $50,000 on deposit In the bank , " And it was hard-earned money that I lost , " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiarity with the conditions under which the Bank of United States purchased the Colonial Bank and the Municipal Financial Bank . According to Mr. Steuer , the price paid for the first was $19,600 , - 000 for assets worth only $6,400,000 and for the second $16,000,000 for assets valued only at $10,000,000 . Both Mr. Hedley and Mr. Metz said they assumed the mergers were " all right " when consummated by the officers . The mergers , they said , had been laid before the board as accomplished facts . Touching upon some of the bank 's real estate investments sharply criticized by examiners for the Banking Department , Mr. Steuer asked Mr. Metz : " You were spending the depositors ' money and I would be glad to have you place in the record some explanation . Were you permitting Marcus and Singer to play with the bank 's money ? " " We had no reason to doubt their competence and honesty at that time , " pleaded Mr. Metz . " I had no reason to think Marcus and Singer were using the bank 's money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no trouble to find out , " interjected Mr. Steuer . " If every director had to go into details about every deal there would be no more boards of directors , " Mr. Metz replied . " Even at that , I do n't know but that it would be a good idea . " Sees It Was Wrong Now . Mr. Metz said that although he did not approve the bank doing a large part of its business through affiliates , he knew that the law permitted it and that for this reason he did not oppose it . " It was all wrong now that you explain it , " he said , commenting upon Mr. Steuer 's explanation of some of the bank 's real estate deals through dummy subsidiaries , deals which cost the bank about $10,000,000 . " Yes , but why did n't you find that out , Mr. Metz ? " asked Mr. Steuer . " What are you going to do if the facts are not explained to you by men in whom you have confidence , " was Mr. Metz 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stock " bargain " sale letter of July 6 , 1929 . He said he did not at the time , but that he did know in general that a special sale of stock to depositors had taken place . He himself , he said , bought ten shares , the maximum permitted under the conditions of the sale . When informed by Mr. Steuer that this sale resulted in great losses to thousands of poor depositors , Mr. Metz admitted that " it was a disgrace to sell to those people . " " Then , why did n't you stop it ? " demanded Mr. Steuer . Mr. Metz explained " It was done before I knew of it . " He will testify again today . ing the testimony of Mr. Van Tuyl , a former State Superintendent of Banks , after Mr. Van Tuyl had declared that some of these loans were " slipped in " by the officers after the executive committee , about a year ago , adopted a resolution that no more real estate loans should be made and that no further loans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real estate . Mr. Van Tuyl said that while the executive committee was responsible for most of the loans to affiliates and subsidiaries , it did eventually call a halt on them , but without avail . He was the first witness to testify to any conflict between the officers and the executive committee . Previous to his testimony the evidence has been that the executive committee was but a rubber stamp in the hands of the officers . Officers Criticized , He Says . " The executive committee was continually criticizing the executive officers , " Mr. Van Tuyl said . Referring to the " slipping in " of real estate loans following the resolution of the executive committee forbidding any more loans of this character , Mr. Van Tuyl said : " We gave instructions and they were not lived up to , and the fight was on . " " When you found the fight was on and that these things were being slipped in by misrepresentation , why did n't you walk over to the Banking Superintendent and tell him about these frauds ? " Mr. Steuer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would n't have had to see the superintendent , " replied Mr. Van Tuyl . " We could have handled the situation ourselves . If we had known of the situation that unfolds now we would have taken action . Eighty per cent of our board was composed of strong , substantial business men who were not afraid of anything that might come up . " Among the loane to affiliates which Mr. Van Tuyl said had been " slipped in " by the bank officers were the $12,000,000 to the Bankus , City Financial and Municipal Financial corporations , which the witness ad. - mittted appeared to have been illegal , since they exceeded 10 per cent of the bank 's capital and surplus , as prescribed by law . Mr. Van Tuyl admitted that he had knowledge of these loans , but denied the loans were granted in his presence . When shown a copy of the executive committee 's minutes of August , 1929 , recording these loans and bearing his signature as secretary of the committee , Mr. Van Tuyl declared he had never seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inserted by " fraud or by mistake . " Steuer Scents Fraud . Citing the fact that previous testimony given by Arthur W. Little and Edward B. Lewis , directors of the bank- , had specifically denied that the loans of $12,000,000 to the three affiliates had come . up before the , executive committee , Mr. Steuer asked : " Did n't you perpetrate a fraud on Mr. Little and . Mr. Lewis when you signed these minutes which included mention of the establishing of these lines of credit ? " " It does seem so , " replied Mr. Van Tuyl . " Do you have any explanation to mall ? " demanded Mr. Steuer . " From the looks of it , it looks as if it were a fraud or , perhaps , Mr. Lewis and Mr. Little were n't there at the time . That 's all I can say without attacking the correctness of the minutes . " Mr. Van Tuyl added that he often had signed the minutes after they had accumulated for as long as two months . He pleaded that in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transactions in question . Mr. Van Tuyl was excused after Mr. Steuer had said to him : " If you desire to make any statement or any explanation of your participation in the management of this bank , I suggest that you make it now . " Mr. Van Tuyl replied that he was willing to answer any questions but had no further statement to make . Before Mr. Van Tuyl Ieft the stand Mr. Steuer informed him that he could not find in the files of the State Banking Department any of the correspondence referred to by Mr. Van Tuyl in his testimony on Tuesday concerning the inquiries he said he made from State officials and the Attorney General of the United States as to the propriety of permitting the use of the name Bank of United States when the application for the bank 's charter was pending in ? 1913 , at the time when Mr. Van Tuyl was Superintendent of Banks . Mr. Van Tuyl repeated his assertions and Mr. Steuer said he would make another search of the Banking Department 's files . Denies Snowing of Report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank 's condition given to the directors in the Fall of 1929 in the face of the report to the contrary of the State Banking Department came after he had testified that he knew nothing of that report and that other officers of the bank , who are supposed to have had knowledge of that report , made no effort to contradict Mr. Marcus . Among the officers mentioned by Mr. Hedley were Mr. Singer , C. Stanley Mitchell , chairman of the board ; Henry W. Pollock , vice president and head of the bank 's law department , and Mr. Kresel . All these men attended the meetings with Mr. Marcus and Joseph A. Broderick , State Superintendent of Banks , held at the bar association to discuss the Banking Department 's adverse report previous to the alleged misleading account of the bank 's affairs given to the directors by Mr. Marcus . " Nobody ever spoke of the meetings at the bar association , " Mr. Hedley said .

" It seems to me that the man to ask about it is Mr. Marcus . I do n't see how it is possible to reconcile the two . They are so directly opposite . It would : seem to me that the facts contained in the Banking Department 's report were the realfacts - and the glowing statements given to us by Mr. : Marcus were riot the real facts . " ?
