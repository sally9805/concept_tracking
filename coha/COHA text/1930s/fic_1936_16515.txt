1 INT . STAGE OF MOVING PICTURE THEATRE - PROLOGUE UNIT-DAY FADE IN The MUSIC that has been playing over the title , the Cast Sheet , the Credit Sheet , etc. , gradually changes from the Kern tunes to impressive thunder music of some kind : Wagnerian crescendoes follow on Wagnerian crescendoes . The CAMERA meanwhile has established in a LONG SHOT a modern Moving Picture Theatre interior , with its packed Audience . As the timpani thunder the CAMERA goes to the Card Rack at the side of the stage on which the names of the acts are exhibited to the Audience . Here we see : THE GREAT CARDETTI &amp; COMPANY and as the MUSIC increases in volume and in importance the CAMERA focuses on the huge purple curtains , on each side of which are embroidered in three-foot letters the initials " C " . As the MUSIC continues , two Boys dressed in Court Liveries of the XVIII Century appear and station themselves at the extreme edges of the stage . Two more appear after them and place themselves closer to the centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves quite close to the centre of the stage . They do this in time to the music . At the climax of the MUSIC the curtains swing apart and a Figure wearing a top hat and a velvet cape , and carrying a cane , appears ... the great Cardetti himself . ( This is Victor Moore ) . He blinks a little in the strong light . He seems just a little frightened . Two assistants relieve him of his cape and gloves ; another relieves him of his cane ; and another hands him a deck of cards . They form a little line at the back of him .  --  2  --  The MUSIC changes once more and segues to the music of the number . Doctor Cardetti ( " Pop " ) comes down to the footlights and says , a little hesitantly : &nbsp; POPI wonder if some gentleman in the audience would be kind enough to come up on the stage and assist me ? 2 INT . MOVING PICTURE THEATRE - AUDIENCE - DAY There in the Second Row is a Man with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Young Man that he go up and assist the magician . The Young Man is diffident . The Girl prods him . He smiles sheepishly and starts to get up . This has been a LONG SHOT of the Theatre which takes in a great deal of the Audience , and , as this Young Man gets up , we see another Figure sitting somewhere near the middle of the house has got up and , pushing through protesting patrons , gains the aisle and , running down the aisle , manages to get in front of the Young Man in the Seeond Row . This is " Lucky " John Garnett ( Fred Astaire ) . He is dressed in a dark business-suit , and carries a hat , cane and gloves . &nbsp; POP ( pointing to Lucky ) You 'll do . &nbsp; LUCKY ( to Man from Second Row ) Pardon me  --  And the Young Man from the Second Row rather sheepishly returns to his seat . Meanwhile Lucky has gained the stage . 3 INT . MOVING PICTURE THEATRE - STAGE - DAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assist you .

The Boys , pretending to cover up , do a rapid dance , and Lucky , not too conspicuous , joins them , at the end of which , while Pop is picking up the cards , Lucky continues :  --  4  --  &nbsp; LUCKYYou see it 's not in the cards for you , Mister It 's not in the cards for you , Mister And if it 's not in the cards for you , Mister Well , it 's not in the cards for you , Mister . &nbsp; POP ( very pathetically walks up to First Boy ) You know what it meant to Columbus to cross the ocean ? &nbsp; LUCKYWait , do n't tell us .

Music is tacit on this ) You look like a boy who could shuffle . ( he hands Lucky the cards as he says : ) Would you mind ? ( and as Pop turns away Lucky goes into a very elaborate dance shuffle ) No  --  the cards . Lucky stops and gives the cards a phoney shuffle . He hands them back to Pop , who , to the amazement of everybody , does the accordion trick successfully . At the conclusion of this trick he motions to the Orchestra Leader again , who starts with the same waltz , and the cards with which he has done the trick fall from his hand , and we see that they are strung together .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket and does the trick of picking a card out of the air . It works twice . The third time , when he puts his hand up , nothing happens . He tries in vain two or three times .

In the background are the New York skyscrapers moving by . Lucky , with his knees crossed , greatly at ease , is reading a newspaper ; while Pop , with his arm limply in a strap , is looking out at the scenery . The car comes to a stop . As they look up the CAMERA pulls back , and we see that we are in the FREIGHT YARDS . As the CAMERA pulls further back we see that the car that they are riding in is on a flat car with two or three other cars that have just been shipped to New York .

Under the Elevated is a newspaper and magazine stand , and to one side of this is one of those automatic cigarette-selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke . &nbsp; LUCKYWell , take the quarter . &nbsp; POPNo-no  --  not the lucky one .  --  37  --  These speeches bring them just in front of the cigarette machine as a man has just taken cigarettes out of the small slot at the bottom , and is lighting one up . Pop gives Lucky the wink and says : &nbsp; POPWatch me  --  I 'll get a smoke . ( to the man ) I beg your pardon  --  could I borrow a match ? The man , blowing the smoke in Pop 's eyes , hands him a paper of matches , whereupon Pop furiously searches his pockets for a package of cigarettes . &nbsp; POP ( lightly ; surprised ) Ha  --  How careless of me !  --  I forgot to bring my cigarettes ! &nbsp; MAN ( grabbing the matches out of Pop 's hand ) Then you wo n't need those matches . Lucky laughs a little , and , meanwhile , Pop has an idea .

As she gets her cigarettes and begins to open the package , Lucky speaks : &nbsp; LUCKYExcuse me , have you change for a quarter ?  --  38  --  &nbsp; POPNo , Lucky  --  not that one !

By this time , Lucky has turned the crank once , but nothing has happened . Lucky and Pop look at each other in consternation . They both shake the machine vigorously and turn the crank at the same time . Three packages of cigarettes fall out and a lot of silver .
