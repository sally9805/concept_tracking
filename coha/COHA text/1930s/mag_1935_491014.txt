T HE White House has no archives . In the Executive Offices , the papers , except for official documents , are the man 's , not the President 's . As for the house itself , no evidence has been found that a permanent record of any kind was kept until March 4 , 1909 , when Major Archibald Butt , Taft 's senior aide , seems to have bought a diary of octavo size and begun the White House daybooks . I. H. Hoover took over the record when he was promoted to Chief Usher in August of that year , and kept it until his death . These twenty-five volumes became his property and form a part of the manuscript he left . They are a record of the comings and goings of the President , his family and guests . The office-appointment list and other collateral information sometimes are added . The only other record kept is a register in which house guests write their names and addresses . This is presented to each outgoing President 's wife at the end of their incumbency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record . Taft , Harding and Coolidge were painters ' Presidents ; Wilson and Hoover were nat . Five portrait painters and one sculptor are listed as working on Taft in his first month in office , often two at a time . Harding was sitting for his first portrait within three months . Coolidge began early and was posing for two artists as late as December . 1928 . But the first Wilson portrait was not begun by John Sargent until October , 1917 , in his second term . Hoover was similarly reluctant to pose . On May 19 , 1910 , the President and Mrs. Taft are recorded as leaving the house at night for " a joy ride . " This expression is repeated occasionally to describe motoring for relaxation , which , as anyone more than thirty will recall , was not just the meaning of " joy ride . " Willie Hoppe , the Boy Wonder then and still a contender , gave an exhibition of billiards in the Blue Room on a special table on New Year 's Eve of 1910 . The company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long-worth , a good amateur , took a cue against Hoppe . Champagne and cake were served . Twenty-three years ago , on July fourteenth , Harry Atwood brought his Burgess-Wright biplane down to a perfect landing on the White House lawn and to a stop about fifteen feet from the drive in front of the south porch . This was preliminary to his receipt of the medal of the Aero Club of Washington from the hands of President Taft for having flown from Boston to Washington in ten days shortly before . The next month Atwood flew from St. Louis to New York via Chicago in twelve days . So few of Atwood 's contemporaries survived the hazards of prewar flying that even the Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce recently told an inquirer that Atwood had been killed years ago . He happens to be alive , and was working on a rocket motor in Massachusetts when last heard from . The next landing on the White House lawn was Jim Ray 's in an autogiro in 1931 . Taft was attending a performance of Nobody 's Widow at Chase 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the news of the Titanic disaster , with the probable death of his aide.and friend , Archie Butt , was brought to him . He returned to the White House at once and waited up most of the night for details . Chase 's Old Theater was originally Albaugh 's Opera House , known to modern Washingtonians as Poll 's . It was torn down two years ago , its site now a small park between the new Commerce Building and the Treasury . Three months later Mr. Taft attended the opening of Chase 's New Theater . This is the house at 15th and G , which soon became Keith 's , and President Wilson 's favorite theater . On May 29 , 1912 , Miss Helen Taft is recorded as dining with Miss Frances Noyes at the Manor House . The hostess will be recognized by readers of THE SATURDAY EVEN iNn POST as the present Frances Noyes Hart , author of The Bellamy Trial . Her father is the publisher of The Washington Star . The officers of the German fleet , then at Norfolk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1912 . Less than five years later , hosts and guests were at war . The guests included Captain Boy-Ed , deported as a spy in the Wilson Administration . When the President returned from Beverly in the fall of 1912 , his gout was so had that his Pullman had to be shifted to a siding from where he could enter his automobile directly . That afternoon he received the International Congress of Applied Chemists in a wheel chair . June 10 , 1913 , marked the end of an old White House institution  --  the bicycle policemen . The two men on that detail were brought inside . Taft 's exceptional cordiality toward his successor was repaid . He was back in the White House lunching with Wilson and Mabel Boardman , by June . Such an early return was without precedent , and only the unusual circumstances of the 1912 election made it possible as a simple act of hospitality , without political significance . President Wilson 's car struck a sixteen-year-old boy , Robert Crawford , on October 4 , 1913 , while the President and Doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Providence Hospital the next day . When the ladies of the Wilson family went to Cornish , New Hampshire , for the summer in 1913 , Dr. Cary Grayson moved into the White House and was the President 's dinner , theater , golfing , walking and riding companion , also accompanying him to and from Cornish . The doctor lived in the White House until October twentieth . He had , too , been a house guest in the closing days of the Taft regime . Early in April , 1914 , the first Mrs. Wilson was taken to White Sulphur Springs . The President was with her there on April nineteenth , when the following note appears in the daybook : " Evening . Word from Mexico in regard to saluting the flag unsatisfactory . Large gathering of newspapermen at office . Secretary Bryan talked with President over phone . Statement prepared by Secretary Bryan and Secretary Tumulty and given out at midnight . Secretary Garrison also came to office . Al ! there until one A.M. Four A.M. President called to talk with Secretaries Garrison and Daniels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning of the twentieth , he must have held his train at Charlottesville , Virginia , while he called Washington . This incident preceded the seizure of Vera Cruz and the war with Mexico that was not a war . The President made his speech to Congress on Mexico that afternoon . " News received of landing of Marines at Vera Cruz " is a note of the next day . Just in passing , the Marine Corps ' very successful campaign to make the country " Marine conscious " had its beginnings here . Three tabloid and unfinished dramas from the daybook : March 21 , 1914 : " Gasoline exploded in the attic . " April 9 , 1918 : " Earthquake felt ? " Sunday . October 21,1923 : " Three A.M. Car smashed . " That is all in each case . On May 28 , 1914 , Theodore Roosevelt , just returned from his River of Doubt expedition , called at the White House to pay his respects . T. R. 's criticism of the Wilson Administration did not begin until after the outbreak of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit : " President Roosevelt arrived in auto , shown to Red Room , where he talked with Miss Hagner  --  social secretary  --  and was presented to Secretary Tumulty while waiting for the President , who was in his study . The President immediately joined him and all four retired to the south porch , where Miss Hagner served tea and lemonade . The visit lasted twenty-five minutes , the President escorting Colonel Roosevelt to the door and tarrying in the vestibule for a final adieu . Large crowd assembled outside . " This was a very different scene from the next meeting of the two men . In February , 1917 , Roosevelt had filed his application with the War Department for permission to raise a division in the event of war . Much correspondence followed ; theAdministration neither refusing directly nor assenting . On April third , Colonel Roosevelt was in Washington with no intention , he said , of calling at the White House , but reading the President 's " force to the uttermost " message , he called to congratulate him . Ike Hoover received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the office . Explaining that he had only a few minutes until traintime , Colonel Roosevelt left his card with Mr. Hoover . But on April tenth he went to Washington specifically to see the President , telephoned for an appointment and talked with Wilson at the White House for forty-five minutes . The discreet daybook says only : " Twelve Noon . Received former President Roosevelt . " Elsewhere the Chief Vsher has testified that he was present and that it was a tense meeting . The twenty-eighth of June , 1914 , was a drowsy Sunday in Washington . The President breakfasted at 10:30 , attended the Central Presbyterian Church with his daughter Margaret and the Misses Smith , house guests , saw Judge Adamson at 2:30 and motored from 4:10 to 7:40 with Miss Margaret and Miss Bones . In Sarajevo an Austrian archduke was assassinated . Washington was more interested than most of America , but only mildly so . The death of the first Mrs. Wilson , August 6 , 1914 , is recorded in the daybook as follows : " After lunch the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as had been their custom since she had been confined closely to her room . The doctors had submitted an unfavorable report and the visit was just a little different . Thus was the afternoon spent. , and when they left the room it was learned that Mrs. Wilson had died at five o'clock . Secretary McAdoo , Mr. Sayre and Secretary Tumulty had waited all this while in the west . sitting room . Doctor Grayson and Miss Harkness , the nurse , were the only ones in addition to the family in the room at the end . " The outbreak of the war passes unmentioned in the daybook , possibly because of concern for Mrs. Wilson 's life , yet there is nothing in the daybook for the rest of 1914 to suggest that Europe was ablaze , no direct . mention of it in 1915 or 1916 . The President had counseled neutrality in word and thought , and the Chief Usher obeyed scrupulously . When Miss Bones and Mrs. Galt left for Cornish , New Hampshire , the summer White House , by automobile in June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever undertaken by a White House resident . Helen Taft and Mrs. Alice Hay Wadsworth had ridden horseback from Washington to Virginia Hot Springs in 1912 in easy stages . The first motor trip farther than Baltimore or Harpers Ferry undertaken by a President occurred on August 20 , 1915 , when Mr. Wilson and Doctor Grayson drove to Philadelphia in the landaulet on the former 's annual visit to a Philadelphia eye specialist . They lost their way in Baltimore , a feat still not impossible to tourists . In Philadelphia they lunched unannounced at the Bellevue and strolled about the business district as newsboys : SS yr t . THE SJITURDAY EVENING POST January 12,15135 were calling extras on the sinking of the Arabic by a German submarine . On Doctor Grayson 's advice , the President returned by train and , not being expected at the White House , was not met at the station . One must read between the lines for May 7 , 1915 , to discover that the Lusitania had been torpedoed that morning with the loss of 1150 lives , including 100 Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cabinet meeting called ten minutes later . The President motored as usual for three hours that afternoon and walked alone from eight to nine . Franklin D. Roosevelt first appears in the daybook on April 26 , 1915 , listed as received at eight . P.M. A little more than six months later , on November third . Herbert Hoover appears , the note reading : " 11:30 A.M. Received Mr. Hoover , of Belgian Relief . " Bernard Baruch does not arrive until the following June fourteenth . The first instance of a President 's adoption of a modern American custom may be found on April 29 , 1916 . The President and Mrs. Wilson motored to Harpers Ferry , leaving in early afternoon and returning at ten P.M. , eating somewhere on the road . Drives of this distance had become common , but not roadside eating . On July 4 , 1917 , the Wilsons left the White House early , taking a picnic dinner , and not returning until nine P.M. Mrs. Hoover was the only other picnicker in the annals . On May Day , 1931 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Washington held its Preparedness Parade on June 14 , 1916 . The President marched in it from the Peace Monument to the White House , fell out there and reviewed the procession until one P.M. , when he went to lunch and did not return . On five mornings in succession beginning August 8 , 1916 , the President and Mrs. Wilson were called at five o'clock , had breakfast and the President worked in his study . The explanation will not be found in the daybook . It was the impending railroad strike . In the ensuing days , railroad and Brotherhood presidents poured through the White House . As late as November 29 , 1916 , pursuing his policy of neutrality in word and thought , the President attended a requiem mass at St. Patrick 's for the late Emperor Franz-Josef . Even by February 3 , 1917 , and the suspension of diplomatic relations with Germany , the circumspect daybook speaks only of the President addressing " Congress on German affairs . " At three P.M. that day the White House grounds were closed to visitors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-sixth , when Wilson asked Congress for power to arm merchant ships against the ruthless submarine warfare declared by Germany on the first , the book says only that the President visited the Capitol . March 4 , 1917 , fell on a Sunday , and the second Wilson inaugural parade was held on Monday , but the Sabbath did not prevent 497 suffragettes , by daybook count , from gathering outside the closed gates of the White House and demonstrating . A year and a half later , the President , so long an uncompromising enemy of suffrage , rode to the Capitol to ask Congress to initiate the Nineteenth Amendment as a war measure . After March fourth the President dropped the theater and golf , even motoring , for two weeks and remained secluded in his apartments all day . On the sixteenth he motored for the first time , on the nineteenth he resumed golf , and on the twentieth he was back at the theater . On the night of April second the President asked Congress to declare that the acts of Germany constituted a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is described by the daybook as follows : " The President breakfasted in his room and worked in his study all morning . He and Mrs. Wilson walked from 12:15 until 1:00 . Only he , Mrs. Wilson and Miss Bones were at lunch . In the midst of it , the War Resolution arrived from the Capitol , and the President left the table to come to the usher 's room to sign immediately , which was 1:18 . Mr. Rudolph Forster , the Executive Clerk , brought the resolution . Mrs. Wilson , Miss Bones , the Chief Usher and Mr. Starling , of the Secret Service , witnessed the signing . " There was a Cabinet meeting at two P.M. and the President spent the evening in his private rooms . Three days later the President was golfing in Virginia with Mrs. Wilson in the morning , attending Keith 's at night with Miss Bones . At Doctor Grayson 's suggestion , the President and Mrs. Wilson took up horseback riding , but after a few trials , both gave it up . But he continued to golf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circus . Franklin D. Roosevelt was a guest in the White House for the first time at the dinner given Balfour and the British War Mission on April twenty-second . On August eighteenth , the President is recorded as " walking to the hotel garden to see Mr. Hoover at 11:30 . " Herbert Hoover had been named head of the Food Administration on the tenth . The President walked to St. John 's Church the next day , and thereafter is recorded often as visiting the War and other departments afoot . On June eighteenth Herbert Hoover was a White House guest for the first time , at a dinner to the Belgian Mission . His three boon friends , Edgar Rickard . George Barr Baker and Vernon Kellogg , also were guests . The President marched from the Peace Monument to the White House again in the parade of the District of Columbia quota of the Nationaldraft-Army on September fifth , falling out there and reviewing the parade . Miss Jeannette Rankin , of Montana , first woman to be elected to Congress , and who is said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was received by the President on October 1 , 1917. her first and only mention in the daybook . " All the family helped decorate the Xmas tree in the oval room in the basement , " reads a note on December 24 , 1917 , the first reference to a Christmas tree in the daybook . The next morning the family are recorded as visiting the tree after breakfast , then going to the library to open presents . The Taft Christmases had been so quiet that " nothing to report " was the usual record of the day . The first Wilson Christmas was spent at Pass Christian , the family were in mourning on the second , the President was on his honeymoon on the third , but on the fourth , 1916 , twelve of Mrs. Wilson 's relatives and seven of the President 's sat down to a family dinner . The day Lenin became Premier of Russia , completing the Bolshevik coup d'etat , November 10 , 1917 , the President is noted as golfing with Doctor Grayson in the morning and motoring with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White House stage of Jesse Jones , of Houston , now chairman of the RFC , occurred in the fall of 1917 , when he called as chairman of a Red Cross committee . On December 3 , 1917 , the President " Received Representative Dill and six members , with General Biddle , who presented the shell of the first shot fired in France by the American Army in fiction . " The book neglects to mention that the shell was fired from a French 75 . The White House began to keep a tabulation of visitors to the public rooms in February , 1916 , and kept it up until January , 1917 ; long enough to show that August was the biggest month , with April second . April now probably leads even the midsummer months , the Easter pilgrimage to Washington growing yearly . " Clocks all set forward one hour " reads a note on March 30 , 1918 , marking the debut in America of daylight saving . Oddly , Washington , which led the way by wartime act of Congress , was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress , in 1919 . While most of the North Atlantic seaboard continues to set its clocks ahead each spring , Washington and Baltimore remain on standard time . Mrs. Franklin Roosevelt got into the White House a year ahead of Mrs. Herbert Hoover . The former , listed as " Mrs. F. Roosevelt , " attended one of Mrs. Wilson 's regular teas on January 4 , 1917 , while Mrs. Hoover first came to tea on January 2 , 1918 . The wounded were beginning to come back in April of 1918 . On the tenth Mrs. Wilson visited the Walter Reed and Naval hospitals . The President is recorded as going to " the office to look at British tank " on April nineteenth . In parentheses is the notation : " burnt hand . " The burn must have been painful , for one week later Mr. Wilson is reported remarkably as playing golf with one hand at Kirkside . The red-hot exhaust pipes of these tanks scorched more than one incautious hand . " Sheep arrived " is the cryptic notation of April ? thirtieth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White House lawn . They remained there Jong after the Armistice . On May 7 , 1920 , they are noted as being turned into the front grounds . ? On May 15 , 1918 , the President and Mrs. Wilson went to Potomac Park to inaugurate the original air-mail service , Washington to New York , abandoned after the war . This , too , was flown by Army pilots . By early summer of 1918 , as evidenced by the daybook , the War Cabinet , composed of Baruch , Hurley , Garfield , Hoover , Vance McCormick and the Secretaries of War and the Navy , was overshadowing the regular Cabinet . The Forgotten Man , Mayor Ole Hanson , of Seattle , was a White House caller on July 27 , 1918 . The launching at Hog Island of the first of the wartime emergency fleet on August fifth , was attended by the Wilsons . To the utter confusion of our merchant sailors and others , Mrs. Wilson , a descendant of Pocahontas , gave these ships Indian names , some of which have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on August 8 , 1918 . On that day Miss Alice Wilson , a relative of the President , was married in the East Room to the Rev. Isaac McElroy , of White Sulphur Springs , West Virginia , but the groom 's name would still be unknown if the daybook were the only record . On September first the Wilsons drove to the Central Presbyterian Church in a carriage . This anachronism is explained by the Fuel Administration 's request to conserve gasoline and the President 's desire to set a good example . The old electric was still in the White House garage and occasionally used , but Mr. Wilson seems to have felt that a more striking demonstration was called for . Whose carriage it was , the book fails to say . The next day the President is listed as motoring again , but on the twenty-second he went to church again by horse power , and the following Sunday the family and house guests are recorded as driving in three carriages . The influenza epidemic kept the President from church in October , church services being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 , 1917 , was the last formal dinner in the White House for nearly four years . Among those present were Herbert Hoover , Hiram Johnson , Uncle Joe Cannon and Perry Belmont . " Mr. Alfred Smith " was received by the President on October 3 , 1918 . This was the first White House call of the New Yorker , then running for governor for the first time . Al Smith has been hack three times since . He attended the funeral of President Harding , was a guest at a luncheon given the governors in 1923 by Coolidge , gathered to discuss enforcement of prohibition , and he called upon President Roosevelt ( ( Continued from Page 313 ) last fall . He has yet to eat ameal in the White House . The daybook reports that the President received the Secretary of State at nine P.M. on October seventh and remained in his study until after midnight . The explanation is that the German Chancellor that day had asked Wilson 's intervention in behalf of an immediate armistice , through a note presented at eleven am. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifter midnight drafting a reply asking if Germany accepted the terms laid down by him on January 8 , 1918 . Colonel House was with him . A week later the daybook records the President as conferring with the Secretaries of War and Navy and Colonel House , at ten a.m. , with Lansing , Tumulty and House again at 2:30 , and as spending the rest of the day in his study working , except to walk to the Galt jewelry store at . 4:30 . Germany had replied accepting the Wilson terms . and the President was drafting an answer demanding that the enemy first evacuate foreign soil and that the German people alter their government . There is no mention of the false armistice on November seventh , but the page for the eleventh begins with the note : " Three A.M. A message came from Colonel House via the State Department of signing of armistice by Germany . President not notified until breakfast time . " The Wilson rule against being wakened evidently made no exception of a war 's end . The President worked all morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the war , which he delivered to Congress at one P.M. He saw only the Public Printer . At 8:30 P.M. , the President and Mrs. Wilson motored on Pennsylvania Avenue , watching the peace celebration rather than joining it . The President addressed Congress on his Fourteen Points on December second and told them he was leaving for Europe the next day . He took with him from Washington Doctor Grayson , Miss Benham , the stenographers Close and Swem , the Chief Usher , Brooks , the valet , and Susie , Mrs. Wilson 's maid . The Chief Usher took the daybook with him and kept it until the end of the year . There is no entry in the 1919 book until July eighth , when the President and his party returned from the Peace Conference . The Chief Usher had been convalescent from pneumonia at the time of the brief return in February , and had kept to his home . Two days after his return , the President laid the treaty and the covenant of the League before the Senate , telling that body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the White House , he told the newspapermen that an agreement to aid France if she were attacked was not an alliance . That night he attended Keith 's and resumed his golfing at Kirkside the next morning . The name of Warren Harding appears but once before November 2 , 920 . The President received the hostile Senate Foreign Relations Committee , of which Harding was a member , at ten A.M. , July 19 , 1919 . All stayed to lunch but Fall and Williams . The others were Lodge , MeCumber , Borah , Hitchcock , Brandegee , Knox , Johnson , Now , Moses , Swanson , Pomereue , Pittman , and Smith of Arizona . On September third the President left on his Western trip , which was to have taken twenty-seven days and to have covered 10,000 miles , to sell the League to the electorate . Stricken at Wichita on the twenty-sixth , he canceled Oklahoma City , Little Rock , Memphis and Louisville , and returned to Washington directly . A handsomely printed itinerary of this trip is preserved in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the cover ; it contains a large folding map , a complete roster of the party , including reporters and newsreel men , and the population , altitude and scheduled time of each stop . The explanation appears in the last name of the roster  --  Thomas L. Lipsett , United States Railroad Administration . The Government was operating the railroads . The daybook becomes a mystery story from October 2 , 1919 , the inception of Mr. Wilson 's critical illness , until the advent of Harding . On the fourth , the notation : " Condition said to be improving , " begins and continues until the tenth , when it becomes " All just the same . " On the twentieth the pages turn abruptly blank . Whether the Chief Usher was ordered to cease his record or acted on his own discretion is not known , but the circumstances of the controversy over the true condition of the President might well have prompted I. H. Hoover to drop the record of his own accord . Not until February 13 , 1920 , does another entry appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resigned on the President 's demand , but the entry is not concerned with this . It reads : " 10:30 A.M. Conference with Labor Committee , Messrs . Jewell , Manorian and Shea . " The record neglects to say with whom the callers conferred . The omission obviously is intentional , for it is repeated again and again , and the President 's name is mentioned only five times from October nineteenth until the end of his administration nearly seventeen months later . The next entry is April 5 , 1920 , when Mrs. Wilson gave a lunch for the Cabinet wives . Their names and the hour are recorded . On the fourteenth the Cabinet is listed as meeting in the study , with Colby , Houston , Baker , Daniels , Payne , William B. Wilson , Meredith , Burleson and Palmer present . Miss Wilson is noted as leaving for New York on the eighteenth . The Cabinet meets again on the twentieth and Mrs. Wilson attends two weddings  --  those of Miss Benham and Nancy Lane . On May tenth begins a series of entries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are numbers of them and their receptions appear to have piled up since the previous October . By whom they wore received is not stated until the twenty-first , when the book specifies that Mrs. Wilson received an ambassador and two ministers . The next day the record again ceases to specify the receiver , and thereafter it alternates between Mrs. Wilson and anonymity . The Cabinet meets regularly and Miss Margaret returns on June twelfth , and leaves again on the fourteenth . From then until July eighteenth , the pages are blank again . On the latter day , the Democratic nominees , Governor Cox and Franklin Roosevelt , called to pay their respects . The entry reads : " Received Governor Cox and Asst . Secretary Roosevelt . They went to office after interview and returned to lunch with Mrs. Wilson at 1:15 . Others present were Senator Glass , Admiral Grayson and Mr. J. H. Bolling . " Only trivia are noted from then until September twenty-seventh , when W. W. Hawkins , president of the United Press , was received . Though the campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Wilson and her guests are set down until October twenty-seventh , when there appears the note : " Eleven a.m . Received Mr. Hamilton Holt and fourteen .

They leave after two or three days . Mrs. Wilson attends the National Theater with a. party of relatives and a concert of the Philadelphia Orchestra with Mme. Jusserand , Mrs. Daniels , Mrs. Pitney , Mrs. J. Borden Harriman and Mrs. Ridley . After many more blank days , Capt . Luther E. Ellis calls on December seventeenth to " pay his respects . " On the twentieth the Misses Maury are recorded as leaving , though there is no record of their having come . The first mention of the President in more than a year occurs on the day after Christmas . It reads : " 6:45 dinner . The President , Mrs. Wilson , Miss Wilson " and eleven others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two days later , the President 's sixty-fourth birthday is noted . " President in study . Twelve Noon . Moving pictures . Afternoon driving . " So reads the page for January 1 , 1921 . We know that the noon picture show in the East Room had been a daily occurrence for some time and continued until March third , yet this is the only reference to it . The next day the President is reported as sunning on the south porch in the morning and driving in the afternoon , but after this burst of confidence , he is not mentioned again until the thirtieth , and most of the intervening days pass in blank . Meanwhile , the defeated Democratic candidate , James M. Cox , called on the twenty-sixth and was " received . " On the thirtieth the President and Mrs. Wilson had tea with Dr. and Mrs. Harry Garfield . His last mention until March fourth is on February sixteenth , with the entry : " To National Theater . The President , Mrs. Wilson and J , R. Bolling . " We know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the theater in a wheel chair a number of THE SRTURDRY times this winter , yet this is the daybook 's only reference of the kind . The lust entry of the Wilson Administration other than the morning of March fourth is found on February twenty-fifth . The ministers of Rumania and Haiti and the Italian ambassador were " received " to present credentials , and " Mr. and Mrs. Clarence Howard " came to lunch . The page for March fourth begins : " Breakfast served as usual in bedroom at 8:30 , the President afterwards going to his own room to prepare for ceremonies . President-elect and party arrived at 10:30 . President joined them in Blue Room at 10:55 . All left for the Capitol at eleven o'clock . " That is the end of Woodrow Wilson 's eight years . The Chief Usher 's secrecy leads inevitably to one inference . That . this inference may not be sound is suggested by a clue on the page for October 18 , 1920 . " Mr. Klauder , Chas . Z. , left " is the note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Philadelphia architect who was a consultant of Princeton when Woodrow Wilson was president of that university . He states that be was a house guest on three occasions in 1920 . The President was planning to build a home in Washington on his retirement and had called in the architect to discuss plans . If two of these visits , with other known incidents , were ignored , the question rises as to how many other guests , visitors and incidents passed without comment by the cautious watcher of the door . If the President was able to talk plans for a new home , it must be assumed that he was not so incapacitated as the daybook 's silence seems to imply . In I. H. Hoover 's notes he was quoted : " When the Wilsons left , we cut at least ten large oil paintings from their frames . The frames were sent to auction , the employes keeping the paintings . We also demolished thirty-two busts of the Presidents , both plaster and metal . " The editor added : " The author does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An omitted apostrophe is the explanation of this mystery .
