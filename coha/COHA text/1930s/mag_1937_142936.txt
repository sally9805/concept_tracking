Near the old Northfield , Mass , summer home of Evangelist Dwight Lyman Moody is Mount Hermon School , which he founded for serious boys willing to work in the fields to win a plain , pious education . Three years ago Mount Hermon 's half century of Christian calm was rudely shattered by a murderous charge of buckshot , fired through his study window at youthful Headmaster Elliott Speer ( TIME , Sept. 24 , 1934 ) . For that shotgun murder no one has ever been brought to trial . But last week another gun and two old associates of Elliott Speer once more surrounded quiet Mount Hermon with an incongruous criminological atmosphere , provided it with a second mystery . In Superior Court at nearby Greenfield , Mount Hermon 's retired Dean Thomas Edwin Elder , 55 , was on trial for assault by gun on Mount Hermon 's retired cashier Stephen Allen Norton , 66 . <P> To a jury of twelve of his neighbors old Mr. Norton , solid and bushy-browed , told the same story he told to the Greenfield police hurriedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was just leaving his garage after driving his wife home from a church meeting when a man in a long coat appeared in the doorway , pointed a gun at him and said in a clear voice : " Norton , I want to talk to you . " Mr. Norton ducked into his house and the man disappeared . But he had recognized a face and voice he had worked with for 22 years . " That man , " said Mr. Norton , " was Thomas Edwin Elder . " <P> Old Mr. Elder told the same story he had told when police arrested him the next ; morning at his poultry farm at Alton , N. H. , where he retired after the Speer inquest in 1934 . He had spent the night of May 25 with his wife at the Eagle Hotel in Keene , N. H. , 30 mi. from Greenfield . He had not worn a long coat that night and did not own one . District Attorney David Keedy called a Keene filling station proprietor to testify that Mr. Elder , wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought eight gallons of gasoline from him at seven o'clock that night . He introduced an Eagle Hotel chambermaid who expressed her opinion that half of the Elders ' double bed had not been slept in . But Defendant Elder would not change a jot of his story . <P> Dragged to the stand to revive an even more ancient scandal was Dr. Henry Franklin Cutler , Elliott Speer 's 75-year-old predecessor . During Dr. Cutler 's regime Cashier Norton was on such precarious terms with Dean Elder that he bored a hole in his office wall to spy on the dean and his red-haired secretary , Evelyn Dill . When Mr. Norton reported to Headmaster Cutler that he had seen the pair kissing and embracing , the headmaster had attempted to straighten things out by holding a " harmony " prayer meeting in his office . At the time , Dr. Cutler painfully recalled , Dean Elder had wanted to thrash Cashier Norton as a " peeping Tom , " Last week Defendant Elder told the court that Accuser Norton haa always been a " Jekyll and Hyde character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , asked whether he bore " enmity " toward the defendant , answered reflectively : " I do n't like that word ' enmity . ' It does n't describe the feeling between us. "
