Hollywood legend has it that when Director Ernst Lubitsch went there he could think of no better use for the many drawers of his huge , flat-top desk than to grow mushrooms in them . So he interlarded bricks of mushroom spawn and fresh horse manure in the drawers , drew many an inquisitive sniff from visitors but never produced a mushroom . <P> Director Lubitsch 's legendary experiment is not so fantastic as it sounds . Mushrooms , which sprout overnight , sprout erratically . Until an Irish Quaker from West Chester , Pa. took a hand in the procedure 33 years ago , mushroom growing was a matter of almost pure chance . Last week the industry Edward Henry Jacob built up from , a six-foot plot in his cellar was the largest mushroom business in the U. S. , and it was busy reaping the harvest from history 's most important single improvement in mushroom growing . <P> From the point of view of the mushroom business , Philadelphia ( of which West Chester is a suburb ) has three advantages-temperate climate , propinquity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manure . Just after the Revolution , when Philadelphia was the U. S. capital , local high livers discovered the mushrooms that had grown wild locally for years . Farmers thereupon tried to grow them artificially . Sometimes they got good crops , sometimes none . Then in 1904 Edward Henry Jacob , an accountant in a cream separator plant , began experimenting with mushrooms . <P> Mushrooms , he learned , are fungi developed from spores which float in the air , too small to be seen by the naked eye . By a process still kept secret , he isolated mushroom spores in little bottles where they developed into spawn in a mixture of sifted manure . Nowadays the Jacob laboratories sell these whitish-brown lumps for 50 a quart ready for planting . The Jacob plant gets most of its manure which must be from " horses which are working hard and fed with grain and mixed feeds only , " from Philadelphia and Baltimore , pays about $6.50 per ton , uses 20,000 tons a year . Buying the manure is a serious problem , for the supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , water and " stale " or mule manure . <P> Jacob mushrooms grow in concrete , aluminum-painted " houses " which are filled with beds of manure compost and kept pitch-dark . Lumps of spawn are pushed into the compost about eight inches apart . In three weeks fine , white , hairlike mycelia extend from top to bottom . Then a " casing " of loam is put on top and in three weeks more the first white pinheads pop out . Each bed bears well for two or three months . Then the tired manure is stripped off , sold to golf courses as a top dressing for $1.50 a ton . The mushrooms themselves , fat , firm and thick as barnacles on a ship , are tended by gloved workmen who wear miners ' head lamps to see in the dark .
