What Bolshevism 's planners think of Bolshevism 's executors pungently appeared last week at a Congress of Master Builders in the Kremlin with Dictator Joseph Stalin and most other Soviet bigwigs present . To make the opening speech Russia 's cloistered priesthood of planners , the Gosplan , sent their economic abbot , Comrade Valerian Ivanovich Mezhlauk , chairman of the State Planning Commission . <P> " Last year we meant to reduce building costs by 15%-we reduced them by 1% ! " boomed Mezhlauk . " This year we planned to reduce costs by 14.5%-we reduced them by 1.25% ! " <P> " Why ? " interrupted several Commissars who were either unable to believe their ears or did not catch the No. 1 Planner 's point . <P> " Why ! " roared back Planner Mezhlauk . " Why , indeed ? Because you , my dear Comrade Commissars , do n't run your business properly ! ' ' <P> A bespectacled Mr. Ginsberg was then produced by Planner Mezhlauk . To his satisfaction Mr. Ginsberg proved to Dictator Stalin &; Commissars that in the U. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a given time as four Russians in the Soviet building industry . In the stone cutting industry , said Mr. Ginsberg , one U.S. quarryman equals ten Russians . <P> This stiff talk was followed by the unfolding of new Bolshevik building plans on a scale more grandiose than ever before . Commented News Pundit Walter Duranty : " Here they are building-mad . From the Arctic Ocean to the Caspian Sea , from the Baltic to the shores of the Pacific , there is such a fury of building as the world never saw . In the coming year the Soviets will spend 32 billion rubles on a building program which , in the valuation of Russian materials and Russian labor , represents between fifteen and twenty billions of dollars .
