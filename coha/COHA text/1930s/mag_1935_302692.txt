( See front cover ) <P> Ford Motor Co. is a Delaware corporation . Its main plant-the most magnificent aggregation of industrial equipment in the modern world-is at River Rouge , Mich . At the start of last year it had assets of $639,000,000 , over one-half of which was in cash or liquid paper . During the past 30 years it has sold more than 22,000,000 automobiles , approximately the total number on the road today . Its principal stockholder once turned down an offer of a billion dollars for the company as a going concern . Since it was founded in 1903 with $28,000 of paid-in capital , it has grossed a few hundred millions in excess of $11,000,000,000 , retained as net gain nearly $800,000,000 . No man in all history has made so much money so quickly or so cleanly as Henry Ford . <P> Mr. Ford is not an officer of Ford Motor Co . His only connection with the corporation is his ownership of 58% of the stock and a seat on the board of directors . With him on the board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owns the rest of the stock , and Vice President Peter E. Martin , one of the few survivors of the countless upheavals in Ford management . There is a secretary and assistant treasurer , and an assistant secretary of the corporation , but no other title within the whole Ford organization . Henry Ford does not believe in titles . <P> It takes an efficient executive staff to run a business whose payroll at one plant alone has been as high as 104,000 persons , whose purchases have run as high as $40,000,000 per month and whose operations include coal mines , glass factories , steel mills and a fleet of 37 ships . Yet the Ford staff is small . All the key men in the company can sit down together at a lunch table in a maple-paneled corner room at the Engineering Laboratory where the elder <P> Ford makes his headquarters . There for counsel and advice go untitled Fordlings like William Cowling ( sales ) , Albert M. Wibel ( purchasing ) and Charles Sorensen , hard-boiled superintendent of the mighty Rouge works. * Also high in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official spokesman , and Harry H. Bennett , who handles personnel and directs Ford Motor 's notoriously efficient police . But the one &; only boss of Ford Motor Co. is Henry Ford . <P> Last week the spare , stooped grey-haired dean of the premier U. S. industry launched a 1935 edition of the Ford V8 , Model 48 . And for the first time in his life he launched a model at the New York Automobile Show , No. 1 of the great fairs where the men from the motormaking provinces of the Midwest each year exhibit their newest and finest transportation wares ( see p. 62 ) . <P> Mr. Ford used to exhibit only Lincolns at the Automobile Shows because Lincoln was a member of the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce ( now the Automobile Manufacturers Association ) which sponsored the exhibits . But Ford , characteristically , never joined the industry 's trade association . This year the show was staged not by the manufacturers but by their local dealers . Hence Mr. Ford exhibited . He sent cross-section displays , a team of two mechanics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , assemble it in ten , a cutaway car on a traveling belt which , when big blocks were tossed under its wheels , demonstrated what Ford calls " Center-Poise , " balanced riding quality . And he also sent a modern car .
