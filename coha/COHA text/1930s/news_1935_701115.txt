txt The war profits control controversy between the Senate Munition . Committee and the House Committee on Military Affairs reached a climax today when administration leaders in the House announced that the bill , which proposes a less drastic wartime control of industry , would be taken up tomorrow and passed not later than Thursday . Immediately the Senate committee , which has been investigating the munitions and related industries since last Summer , made public the draft of a bill it expects to introduce in the Senate next week . This Senate measure would eliminate all corporation profits in excess of 6 per cent , while individual income taxes would be rewritten upward to a point where there would be practically no incomes of more than $10,000 during a war period . At the same time incomes within the $10,000 limit would be subjected to greatly increased levies , both normal and excess . The Senate committee today resumed its investigation of the shipbuilding industry , beginning a series of bearings in which the smaller shipyards will come under scrutiny . The Federal Ship Building and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsidiary of the United States Steel Corporation , was the first on the list , and its president , L. H. Korndorff , was questioned on matters brought out in a search of his files . This search disclosed that company officials had felt that their yard was a target for adverse propaganda where naval contracts were concerned . House Bill Likely to Stand . The committee was just beginning its inquiry when Speaker Byrns announced that the bill would have the right of way in the House tomorrow . Some scattered attempts will be made to amend the bill , some of them changes to make it more nearly approach the control severity proposed in the Senate bill , but all the signs tonight are that the bill will pass in substantially the form reported out by the committee . The Senate bill will be known as the " Emergency Wartime Act " and is to be effective for the period of the " emergency . " Chairman Nye , speaking for the committee , described the bill as seeking to " pay the costs of any war as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations . " It would end wartime profiteering and eliminate " the chaos certain to come in post-war deflation , " he held . " The bill is drastic because war is a drastic thing , " he said . " The tax collector who comes for one man 's money is not nearly so solemn and forbidding as the draft officer who knocks at another man 's door and calls for his young . son . " Tax Provisions the Core . . The core of the bill is the tax provisions . A normal tax of 6 per cent is levied on all individual incomes in excess of the credits against the net income , the surtaxes applying to all incomes in excess of $3,000 , the surtax levies beginning at 10 per cent and rapidly increasing to the maximum of 94 per cent on all incomes of and above $10,000 . The bill would impose on every corporation income described in the Internal Revenue Act of 1934 a tax equal to 50 per cent of such incomes as was not in excess of 6 per cent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent of the ' net income in excess of the capital stock . The individual surtax provisions were described in the bill as follows : " Upon a surtax net income of $3,000 there shall be no surtax : upon surtax net income in excess of $3,000 but not in excess of $5,000 , 10 per centum of such excess . " $200 upon surtax net incomes of $5,000 ; and upon surtax net incomes in excess of $5,000 and not in excess of $6,500 , 30 per centum in addition of such excess . " $650 upon surtax net incomes of $6,500 ; and upon surtax net incomes in excess of $6,500 and not in excess of $8,000 , 50 per centum in " addition of such excess . " $1,400 upon surtax net incomes of $8,000 ; and upon surtax net incomes in excess of $8,000 and not in excess of $10,000 , 70 per centum in addition of such excess . " $2,800 upon surtax net income of $10,000 ; and upon surtax net incomes in excess of $10,000 , 94 per centum in addition of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is declared , an " industriarmanagement board " would be set up and begin immediately the drafting of all persons serving as officers or directors of a corporation as well as all other persons holding " policy-forming positions " in such corporations . These would be registered by boards similar to those which functioned as Draft Boards during the World War . When an industry was declared to be essential to the prosecution of the war , these officials would be automatically inducted into the armed forces with appropriate military rank and be paid the same salaries as received by officers of the same rank in the fighting services . Other provisions include one for the closing of all commodity exchanges by a " commodities control board " with powers including the fixing of prices for all commodities , and restricting their sale to the government . The President would have authority to close all security exchanges for the war period . A " securities commission " would have power to approve or disapprove all new issues of securities for the war period . This commission could also take over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund would be created for that purpose . Price-Fixing Powers Bestowed . The President would have authority to fix prices for any article on a pre-war or regional parity , to establish priorities and to conscript the use of property essential to successful prosecution of the war . He could also license industries and fix conditions for the issuance of such licenses in businesses or industries related to carrying on of the war . In making public the bill , Senator Nye pointed out that the measure declared that the intention of Congress was that no person " shall profit in any manner from the conduct of a war . " " The committee can not guarantee that this bill will not be repealed under pressure at the beginning of a war , " he continued . " It can not honestly guarantee that its administration will remain uninfluenced by the pressure of huge and recalcitrant corporate taxpayers . " It can simply state that , given the conditions of no repeal and efficient , honest performance , it will do more than any other proposal before Congress to limit profiteering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another past-war deflation , To Check Profiteers . " This bill is intended to check profiteers and prevent grasping groups , strategically placed , from using a national disaster to press still further the immense concentration of wealth which oppresses the nation , " Mr. Nye continued . " It is something more than that . It is a plan to protect our whole economic society  --  rich and poor ? from the economic disturbances which result from war . At the same time , by universal use of all our resources , it makes the national defense invincible . " It will doubtless have critics . But there will be no place in the discussion which must ensue for the man who says we must not take away from the munition maker during war his sacred profit . " Every man who can find a hole in the bill , through which the greedy industrialist , with the aid of his patriotic lawyer , can crawl , ought to point to that hole . " In August , 1933 , the Federal yards were finishing a destroyer contract for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. Irwin , president of the United States Steel Corporation , wrote that he hoped the work of the Federal yards would effectively eliminate the propaganda directed against the yard in the matter of naval construction . . Baruch 's Name Mentioned . The memorandum did not disclose the source of the propaganda and when Mr. Korndorff was asked to explain he replied that the reference was to the competitive situation . In a letter Aug. 4 , 1933 , Mr. Korndorff referred to the transfer of ownership of the New York Shipbuilding Corporation to the Cord interests of Chicago and to a report that Ben C. Smith and Bernard M. Baruch were also interested in the transaction . " I am reliably informed that Mr. Baruch and his associate , Mr. Ben C. Smith , are interested in the project , " he wrote . " This is quite interesting in view of Mr. Baruch 's reported relations with the present administration . " In his appearance last week , Mr. Baruch told the committee that Mr. Smith , who was disclosed some weeks ago as half-owner , with Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had tried to sell him 5,000 shares of the corporation , using the prospect of increased navy business as an inducement . Mr. Baruch said he declined to buy the stock . The problem of financing a big naval building program for Brazil was mentioned in a letter Oct. 5 , 1933 , from A. W. - Basch , manager in Brazil of the United States Steel Products Company , to H. G. Vollmer , manager of the company 's bridge and building department in New York City . Sought Aid on Brazilian job . " The question of financing will play a large part in the government 's decision and , in this connection , if the Americans are to expect any unusual consideration , the fact that we have a naval mission in Brazil should be capitalized , and it would be well if some one asked Washington to tell United States naval representatives to cooperate with industry , " Mr. Basch wrote . " As you , know the program run 's into millions of dollars . How all this can be accomplished without foreign loans over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter that should at least be given consideration , and if considered of enough public interest to the States , the people through the government might , perhaps , have to carry the bag , such as they are doing in the case of many other loans and subsidies . " Mr. Korndorff , when asked about the letter and its suggestions , replied that nothing came of it and that no move was made in the direction suggested by Mr. Basch . In the matter of American naval bids , the committee called Mr. Korndorff 's attention to the " amazing closeness " of bids submitted in 1934 by the Bethlehem , Federal , United and Bath yards for the construction of light destroyers . Federal 's bid was $3,410,000 ; Bath , $3,429,000 ; United , $3,400,000 , and Bethlehem , $3,413,000 . Two destroyers were awarded to each company . " We all had the same specifications and all of us had to procure our materials from the same sources , and the closeness of the bids was just a coincidence , " said Mr. Korndorff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind as between the bidding yards .
