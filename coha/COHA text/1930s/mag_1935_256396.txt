Underneath their heavy coifs tears trickled down their cheeks last week as Sister Neophyta , 56 ( born Maria Menke ) , now Mother Superior of the Order of St. Augustine at Cologne , and Sister Englatia , 57 ( born Gertrud Dohm ) , faced their judges in Berlin 's Criminal Court . The charge : smuggling 200,000 paper marks out of Germany contrary to the Reich 's foreign exchange regulations . <P> " Are you guilty or not ? " the prosecuting attorney kept roaring . <P> " I confess , " said Sister Neophyta , " that I sent money abroad . " <P> She was sentenced to five years ' imprisonment , the loss of all civil rights and a fine of $48,400 . Sister Englatia received a $400 fine and ten months . <P> Theirs was the fourth of 52 such smuggling cases pending against Catholic nuns and monks . All 52 raised Nazi diehards to a fine frenzy , for the principle at issue struck at the very fundamentals of Nazi philosophy . Here were Germans of exemplary private character , vowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a worldly matter as money their highest duty was not to the nationalist German State , but to an international organization , the Church of Rome . <P> The first " holy smuggling " trial fortnight ago was that of Sister Wernera ( born Katherine Weidenhfer ) of the Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul in Cologne . Years ago the Sisters of Charity borrowed $100,000 from Mercantile-Commerce Bank &; Trust Co. of St. Louis to complete a nursing hospital in Cologne . On the dot the sisters met installments of their debt , until just $25,000 remained owing by 1935 . A Dr. Hofius , good Catholic layman , of the Mnster Bank in Westphalia , suggested how this last amount might be paid off . By elaborate code ( whenever Mercantile-Commerce was to be mentioned , the nuns used the phrase " Louis has written a letter " ) , he advised the sisters to smuggle paper marks out of Germany , pay off the St. Louis debt and further reduce their obligations by repurchasing their own bonds at lower rates in foreign markets . <P> To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You started your letter : ' Let God 's grace be with us , ' " cried he . " How did you dare commit such blasphemies to cover up common smuggling ? I have not seen anything to equal it even in cases of Jewish and Galician grafters . " <P> Sister Wernera was sentenced to five years and a fine of $56,000 . <P> Said George W. Wilson , Executive Committee Chairman of the St. Louis bank : " Is n't it a commentary that Sister Wernera should be penalized for her courage and integrity in trying to meet an obligation of honor , and that others are commended for evading their just debts ? "
