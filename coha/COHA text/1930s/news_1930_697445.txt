txt Tuesday was . a bad day for the utilities . They had been under fire in a dozen States , and in almost every case electoral victory perched on the banners of their severest critics . In Pennsylvania GIFFORD PINCHOT was elected Governor , in New York FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT , in Wisconsin PHILIP LA FOLLETTE . All are foes of what some of them like to call the " power trust . " All are dissatisfied with present-day methods of regulation . PINCHOT had a new scheme to propose this time ? substitution of an elected " fare rate board " for the existing Public Service Commission . Nebraska returned to the Capitol that battlescarred veteran of utility warfare GEORGE W. NORRIS , champion of government ownership and sponsor of the Muscle Shoals bill . East Tennessee rejected Representative REECE because he had led the opposition to the Norris bill in the House . Massachusetts , Montana , Arizona ? , Colorado , Ohio and Oregon all plumped for candidates who had prodded the utilities , or criticized the commissions , or favored municipal ownership , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cord between politics and electric light and power . One would have to search with a microscope to find a successful candidate for high office who defended the utilities , or even had a kind word to say for the regulatory process . They may discover a crumb of comfort , however , in California , where Los Angeles voters defeated a bond issue , part of the proceeds of which were to be spent on preliminary contacts with Boulder Dam . Some candidates ' bark , too , may be worse than their bite : even Mr. PINCHOT hastens to assure his constituency that he has " never opposed a public utility " that was giving the people a square " deal . " A number of States which elected Governors pledged to war on the utilities , at the same time elected Legislatures likely to hold the Executive in check . Nothing subversive is to be expected from the New York Legislature , for example . In Connecticut it would be a fine thing if Dean CROSS could succeed in breaking the hold of the electric light companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will have a hard time doing it . Now might be a good time for the utilities to take sober thought about the future . They are not blameless . They have allowed intricate corporate structures to bewilder the public and baffle the commissions . Some of them have paid excessive prices for plants and tried to charge the excess to the consumer . Others , under cover of rates still at pre-war levels , rising commodity prises and complaisant commissions or courts , have paid to their stockholders profits that should have been shared with the public . More than one company has been caught exerting influence or inspiring propaganda beyond the proper bounds . Too many executives have thought of " public ' relations " as merely a matter of press agents and customer ownership . Very few of them have evolved an explicit public policy like the telephone company 's . Yet there are Z plenty of men of good-will and fore . sight in the industry who could , ix similar fashion , meet , the public half . way .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
