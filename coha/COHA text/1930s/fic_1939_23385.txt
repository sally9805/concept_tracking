SETTER AND TERRIER A STORY BY PRESTON QUADLAND rEvE POPPAS , owner of the Marathon Cafe , smiled as he looked out of the back window at two dogs searching for food in the ash barrel . They never would upset the barrel again , because he had wired it down ; and he had seen to it that they would find nothing to eat . Setter and Terrier were at the barrel . Setter said : " Just ashes . " " Nothing but ashes , " added Terrier disappointed . " Bones are as rare as graveyards , " remarked Setter . " They are , " returned Terrier . " But in my day I 've known them more plentiful than butlers ' gravy . " As Setter stretched his long forepaws up to the rim of the barrel to give a final sniff , Terrier said : " You 're frightfully thin . " " Not from choice , " replied Setter . " Furthermore , you need a bath , " added Terrier . " Indeed I do , " Setter agreed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep breath and wade into the brook up to my neck . A little green frog with gold bands round his eyes used to sit on the bank and gulp at me . If my feet got muddy from the bottom of the stream I 'd wipe them off by leaping through the high grass . It 's great fun ; the long grass tickles your stomach and makes you laugh . Here in the city I do n't get a bath till it rains . " Getting down on all fours , he said : " But we both need a bath . " Terrier blinked pink eyes and gazed sorrowfully at his unkempt coat . " I could still be a gentleman , " he said . " My master was a gentleman ; he took two baths a day . " " Excessive bathing enervates me , " said Setter . " Was your master a lazy fellow ? " " Oh , no . " " Where is he now ? " " Master went to Europe over six weeks ago , " replied Terrier gravely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door to me and said ' Shoo ! ' just as if I were any common house fly . When I did n't budge he gave me a shove with his foot and almost shut my tail in the door . " " I always wanted to be a gentleman , " said Setter , " even though they wear red caps when they go hunting . " Carefully Terrier measured him . " I might find a place for you as a gentleman 's gentleman , " he said . " You do n't bark at the moon do you ? " " When I 'm happy . . when I race through the fields at night . " " Barking will never do , " admonished Terrier . " Yipping 's more the style . Do you know the old dowager who wears pearls on her toes ? " " I ca n't say that I do , " replied Setter . " But I know the scents in the wind and the weather side of a goat . " " Do you know the men who slip on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Setter . " And I know the sound of the pussy willows . " " Do they go swish , swish ? " " No , " said Setter laughing . " How then ? " " Did you ever hear the mushrooms grow overnight ? " " No , " replied Terrier . " Then I ca n't explain it , " said Setter , " for it 's very much like that . It 's like the oozing of pitch from the pine trees too , a very peculiar and particular sound . " " Is it like a small mouse running over the attic floor ? " " Not at all . But it is not unlike the sound of a mole walking deep in his burrow . " " Is it like the maid snoring on the top floor when you 're down in the cellar ? " " I 'm afraid you do n't catch the idea , " said Setter . " My dear fellow , your ears are way too keen for a gentleman 's gentleman , " remarked Terrier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrel . The dogs scampered to a safe distance and then started walking . Terrier had a difficult time catching up with the larger dog . " I believe , " said Terrier puffing , " that we might see if my master 's home . He seldom stays away longer than six weeks . " " Is your master happy by nature ? " asked Setter . " Not particularly , " replied Terrier . " The happiest I ever saw him was one day he came home late from the office . He was dressing for dinner and I distinctly remember he had a slight bruise on one knee . Patting me on the head , he smiled and called me by name , saying , ' Pepys , old boy , what in the world do you do for excitement ? ' " " Is your master tall ? " asked Setter . " Quite . " " Does he wear a beard ? " " Once he did . I was lying on the rug resting when the telephone rang and master began shouting into the mouthpiece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't see him for four days ; when he returned he had a beard . " " Beards grow fast , " said Setter . " They do , " agreed Terrier . " Some faster than others of course . " " On blond men they show less , " replied Terrier . " On light-haired women too , " said Setter . " Women do n't have beards . " " Do n't they though ! " exclaimed Setter . " My master 's grandmother had a gray one . " Setter sniffed the air . " Is your master old ? " he asked . " Forty-two his last birthday , " replied Terrier . " And stout ? " " Not when I last saw him . But sometimes he changes from middling to stout in a few weeks ; and back again to middling in about six months or a year . " " The goldenrod fades to mere stalk in the fall , " said Setter , " then grows again in the spring . " " Master never went that far , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is your master nice ? " he asked . " He 's fastidious , " replied Terrier . " What 's that ? " " That 's keeping the towels arranged just so in the bathroom . " " I think I see , " said Setter . " Otherwise , does he have any faults ? " " He makes me sleep in a basket . " " In a basket ! " cried Setter . " Do n't you feel like needles and thread ? " " Every Monday I feel like the laundry , " said Terrier . " It 's that kind of a basket . " Setter , from nose to tail , seemed very long beside the other . He was in front of and behind him at the same time , so that you could see Terrier only by looking at the two dogs from the right direction . " One ought to be wary of strangers , " remarked Terrier , looking up . Setter said : " The thistle has a blossom loaded with nectar . " Terrier eyed him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Tell me about yourself . " Setter thought for a while . " I like to be happy , as few people do , " he said finally . " Sometimes I bark at people , but I would n't bite them because I love them too much . Sometimes I even bark at myself . Often I bark for no reason at all , if the wind is cool and the maples are whispering . Sometimes I bark when I hear an animal passing in the night and the hair rises on my back . But most of the time I 'm silent and if my stomach is full I 'm content just to doze . " " Why did you come here ? " asked Terrier . " My master came to get a job . Because his money ran low I ran away , thinking I 'd shift for myself and go back when he was better off , although he always fed me well . I returned a few weeks ago , but he was gone . There was an old hat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You never should let loose from a good provider , " said Terrier . " Bread is for them who can teach others to share it . " " The old hen on the farm used to say that you do n't build your nest for the sake of the weasels , " replied Setter . " Do old hens know the answers ? " " If minds are sharp and spirits young , " said Setter . They walked along in silence , shying away from automobiles in the road when people forced them off the sidewalks . An old woman tried to pat Setter on the head and he would have liked to stop , but Terrier told him you could n't trust women and made him hurry by . Setter did n't like that . Women were all right , he thought . They were part of the Great Scheme . Women were just as necessary as fire or water or pain . Setter suddenly was struck with the fact that he needed a bath and said : " You do n't miss being clean till you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Terrier . " Godliness , " corrected Setter . " I knew it was something like that , " said Terrier . " A common expression ; but people do many common things . " " They do , " said Terrier . " Like drinking coffee in the morning . " MAGAZINE Terrier said : " I drink milk . It 's good for stomach ulcers . " " Do you have ulcers ? " asked Setter . " No , " replied Terrier , " but master does . " " I like milk , " said Setter . Setter stepped back to let a woman pass in front of him . " Her clothes sound like a light spring frost , " he said . They came into a better part of the city , where the dogs they saw were clean and turned aside their heads as they walked by . Terrier lifted his head and held it high , his carriage cocky as could be , his tail curved upward . Here he felt somewhat ashamed of Setter , whose tail drooped . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What do you have for dinner ? " asked Setter , thinking of roast beef . " Usually dog food out of a can . " " Out of a can ! " exclaimed Setter , who thought only maple syrup and salve came in cans . " It 's specially prepared , " said Terrier . " It has all the vitamins . " " What are vitamins ? " asked Setter . " Bone and gristle ? " " No . " " What then ? " " A , B , 17 , and G. " " What ? " Terrier repeated . Setter said : " Did n't you ever chase your breakfast before the sun comes up , and leap over stone walls so hungry you could take a bite out of a fence post ? " " My vitamins do n't run , " said Terrier . " Honestly , " cried Setter in amazement , " have n't you ever raced past a woodchuck just to hear his teeth clatter ? " " No , " replied Terrier , " but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of a can ; it 's more sanitary . " Setter declared Terrier 's master must be a wise man to get dog food out of a can . " Do you know who was the smartest man in the world ? " asked Terrier . " Tell me , " replied Setter . Terrier said : " Solomon . " " I never heard of him , " returned Setter . " Was he smarter than the firefly who sits on your tongue when you bite at him and then lights up your mouth to see where your teeth are ? " Terrier bobbed his head affirmatively . " What about the old mink who stole the bait out of my master 's trap ? " asked Setter . " Was Solomon smarter than he ? " " What does a mink know ? " scoffed Terrier . " He 's smarter than the trout because he feeds on trout . " " Feeds on trout ? " said Terrier . " Yes , " replied Setter . " In that lies the Story of the World . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wisest man who lived , " said Terrier . " Wisdom is another matter . " Setter said nothing for a while and then added : " I wonder if Solomon was wiser than the bud that breaks into flower and perfumes the whole garden ? " Setter knew by the jauntiness of Terrier 's step that they were in a familiar neighborhood . The houses frightened Setter . They were all attached to one another so that you could n't race between them in a pinch . You could run only in two directions  --  forward and backward . He felt that a boot might pop out of a doorway at any moment and catch him in the ribs or someone might come rushing down front steps to frighten him away . " This is the street I live on , " said Terrier proudly , as they rounded a corner . " We like it here but it 's expensive . " " It 's all man-made , " remarked Setter . " Man-made ? " " Yes , " said Setter . " They 've removed Nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Land is at a premium in the city , " replied Terrier . " There is no land in the city , " said Setter . " Just buildings and pavement . " Setter continued : " What do you suppose city angleworms do at night when they ca n't come up to the surface for air ? " " You 're an odd chap , " said Terrier . " You know , " said Setter laughing , " sometimes in the early morning I used to creep up and grab an angleworm by the nose and then pull backward just to see him stretch . " Setter became thoughtful . " Ambition does strange things to people , " he said . " You , ambitious ! " cried Terrier . " I was thinking of master , " said Setter . " Oh . What about him ? " asked Terrier . " He wants to be a bookkeeper , " replied Setter . Without the slightest warning Terrier gave a low whine of joy and raced toward a man and woman coming down the steps of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terrier reached them he began to leap against the man 's trousers . " Get away ! " cried the man , trying to push him off with his foot . " Scat ! " exclaimed the woman . Setter stood safely at the curb . Changing his tactics , Terrier started to leap against the woman . " Why , Robert , it 's Pepys , " she cried . " The little wretch is positively filthy ! " The man reached down and picked him up by the neck . " So he is ! " he said gruffly . Setter thought the woman looked beautiful . The door to the house opened and a butler came down the steps . " It 's Pepys , " said the man to the butler . " Here , take the little beast and give him a bath ; then sec that he does n't get off his leash again . " The butler took Terrier with a firm hand and accidentally pinched him hard . Pepys yipped . Setter looked on as Terrier was carried back up the steps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away .
