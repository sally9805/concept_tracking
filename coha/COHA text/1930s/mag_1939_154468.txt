In the tiny troop-packed Hungarian village of Debreczen one morning last week the earth quaked , chimneys tumbled , ceilings crumbled , pictures fell . Excited villagers , thinking war had come at last , leaped from their beds and ran down into cellars to avoid bomb splinters . No sooner had they discovered their mistake than Hungary actually was at war . The quake lasted 40 minutes , the war three days . Neither did much damage . <P> Hungarian troops and planes invaded Slovakia . Immediate objective was the important Ung Valley railroad connecting Hungary with Poland . Hungary 's larger ambition is eventually to gain control of all Slovakia , which used to be in the Austro-Hungarian Empire . Adolf Hitler , having just assumed a 25-year responsibility for Slovak territory , hurried back from Memel . At week 's end , it seemed that Hungary would get the railroad , but nothing more . <P> After three days of fighting , a truce was declared . As peace negotiations began in Budapest , Hungary claimed a complete victory . Official Hungarian statements said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought down and 17 destroyed on the ground ; that the only Hungarian loss was the capture of two men who had accidentally taken a wrong road . Slovak dispatches listed 23 Hungarian dead and 55 wounded . German communiques insisted the whole thing was just a border incident .
