txt Suggestion for Employment . To the Editor of The New York Times : Many girls and women in this country are out of work and without sufficient funds for lodging . I suggest that two to five girls be stationed at all gasoline stations , and when an automobile drives up for oil or gas they make it their business to clean off the dust from the windshield or windows , not asking any pay , but taking a chance on tips . Then , if it also were possible , the government should put into a fund 5 per cent of the tax it now collects and distribute this 5 per cent equally each month to all girls or women so employed . This fund should be placed In the hands of the Controller of each State for him to distribute or through the Red Cross association . W. P. BURKE . Syracuse , N. Y. , June 24 , 1932.
