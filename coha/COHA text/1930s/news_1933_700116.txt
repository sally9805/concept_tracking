txt Voters Should Enroll . To the Editor Of The New Yon ; Times : Nextwee4 will be registration week and the need to enroll also should be brought to the attention of every qualified voter . A registered voter may vote at any general election , but what should be understood as well is that if one is to vote in a primary he or she must be enrolled . Registration is not sufficient . In all places of 5,000 inhabitants or more registration must be personal and voters may enroll at the same time . Where personal registration is not required each year voters may enroll on election day . The advantages of enrolment can not be stressed too much . At primaries enrolled voters only can vote for the candidates who are seeking to run on the party ticket , to obtain membership on party committees and to be delegates to their party conventions . Enrolment is a party privilege . MARY GALLATIN HOPPIN . Glen Head , N. Y. , Oct. 2 , 1933.           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
