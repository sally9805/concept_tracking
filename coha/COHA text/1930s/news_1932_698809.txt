txt With its volume of business unchanged from the low point to which it declined about six months ago , salary and wage reductions instituted by Foster Wheeler Corp . last year will help the company to show a smaller deficit in the first half of 1932 than in the last halt of 1931 . In the first half of 1931. the company showed a profit of $70.828 , more than covering the preferred dividend requirements for the period , but the rapid decline in business in the second half year resulted in a loss for the full year of $349,909 before depreciation , taxes and reserve for contingencies . After deduction of these latter charges . the loss for the year was $753,913 . The actual out-of-pocket cost of running the business last year therefore was only about $360,000 , and with a betterment of this figure in the six months to end June 30 , 1932 , FosterWheeler will retain its reasonably strong cash position . Demand Better From Oil Trade In recent weeks there has been a marked improvement in the demand for equipment from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need for longer term credits than Foster Wheeler is willing to extend , the desire for equipment has not been transformed into actual business , but a good volume of business has been done for this industry for replacement and modernization of equipment . This latent demand is sufficient to increase Foster Wheeler 's operations to near capacity if the company was willing to take business on easier credit conditions than it is requiring at this time . While the market for new equipment to expand existing capacity of the customers of Foster Wheeler is apt to be small for some time , there Is a field of replacement and modernization which would permit Foster Wheeler to earn money if this demand were released by improved conditions . With approximately $4,000,000 of unfilled business on its books , it now appears likely that the company will be able to continue to operate at the present rate for the rest of 1932 , although releases on some of the business booked are held up for lack of funds . Inventories Held Low Foster Wheeler recently received quite a bit of business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less favorable , this is drying up . Since virtually all of Foster Wheeler 's business is done on order on special design , the company 's inventories are low In comparison with the volume of business which it does , amounting to only $1,558,835 at the end of 1931 compared with 52,351,762 at the end of 1930 . Cash at the end of 1931 was $1,066,937 and at that time the company also held $1,209,334 of marketable securities . The company has stopped payment of dividends on the common stock , but with only 17.518 shares of preferred stock outstanding , the company has continued the payment of the 5125,000 in dividends which that stock receives annually .
