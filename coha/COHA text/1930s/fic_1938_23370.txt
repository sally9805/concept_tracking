TRUE BELIEVER A STORY BY MADGE JENISON C HE was a peasant woman living a mile S out of Arles to the northwest . She was sixty years old . She had married , had children . She was of middle height , her bones showing everywhere in her frame . Her enormous hands and feet seemed points at which she was held to the earth , as the roots of a tree hold by their pull . She lived alone on a farm of five fields in a house of the country , of rubble and stone whitewashed . On the windward side a row of cypress trees stood against the mistral . The red-tiled roof of faded pink that was rose and orange that was rose took in the light because the tiles were grooved , purple , green , and red . Her husband had left her five years before . He had gone away on a wagon passing their lane and she had never heard of him since . Everythingon the farm was a muddle and failure when he went , and she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and husbanded it field by field , fence by fence , season by season . When her husband left she was without money and so she went to clean at a big house in Arles . The cook told her of some talk the butler brought down from the table . She meditated on what this woman said and she had begun to raise very choice truffles which had before been only hunted in the forest by dogs trained to nose them out . She made excellent cheese and rye bread , the native brandy , and a conserve of lemon . She made the special wine of the country of pale rose  --  yin rose  --  a first pressing with great flavorof the grape . She kept goats and geese and had a good breed of French poultry . She had bought a cow . A cow was a rarity in the district , and she had an assured and lavish public for her butter . Fine people had begun to come in to the Provence , establishing themselves on the old neighborhood properties , and much money was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cart her bottles and pots , grapes laid between damp leaves , green almonds , figs , and a full-bodied fragrant apricot which grew on espaliers on the south walls of her house and barn . She took everything late in the afternoon , so that her wares went almost from her vines and furrows to the tables of her customers . She was very solitary . Her husband had brutalized her sons , and as soon as each was old enough he had gone away . She seemed to be an abstraction of woman , as if it were probable that hers was a character of only two or three masses , with only two or three shapes within it  --  day night , work sleep , sowing harvest , order disorder , clean not clean . She did only two or three things ; and she thought only two or three things  --  to sow , reap , store , and prosper . In the mornings she would stake her herd of goats out in the open country and go after them at evening . All day she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone against the landscape . At night she drank big bowls of goat 's milk or soup and ate hunks of black bread and went to bed . All the marked events of this woman 's life were part of the earth . She had a relation to the great logical and organic nature of matter , by which peat goes over into carbon , carbon into diamond , children are born , and the soil opens and yields . Her life was on a planetary scale where the landscape , made of sky , the earth fat with oils strong and fierce , the mistral , the river , were the events . She was not outside all that but part of the great thing , as if she were only blocked from it and not yet wholly emerged . The Rhone very shallow here , rushes up the earth and carries down boulders , so that the whole of the wild , white Camargue is coated with rubble for thirty miles and rotten with rock . The unfenced tremendous stony plain , the huge scene desolate , bold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were something to which she was related as on the mother 's side . Standing in the middle of a field sometimes with arms folded across her breast , looking about , she did not exactly worship but she had a bodily sense of what was there around her , as if she passed her hand over the entire universe . Of all the year the strong cold winter evenings were the time she liked the best . This is the time when the ground makes its liquors . The spring was just under there . It was not gone but was ready to issue again . A little warmth , a tilt of some cup , it would come up through the ground along the roots , in fire . When she went with her lantern to break the ice in the pond for the geese to get their water , as the winter dusk came on , she partook of something , and made obeisance , and received a vision . Along the north end of her home pasture there was a rolling slope of land . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clump of lombardies . This roll of the earth and bend of toad and clump of trees was something she liked  --  the way the lombardies bent in the wind and went into a repeat forming one whole with her field and the road . She often looked at this place . It was not a slope nor a bend alone . There was somethingfirm and heavy here that shewanted . Her eye would run along it and she would seem to lay her arm down on it and fit it into her elbow . She did not merely look at this place . It involved her . Solidity was always something in which she was involved . She dreamed one night that she had hands so big that she could reach out and they would cover the hills . She owned from Bella , the cow she had bought , a herd of four . Her cattle had for her something the earth , the sky , and river did not hold . She would take a variety of connections with a cow , its hulk and stoniness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herd moved away from you , as they would step together in a line , they were a single flow , and she noticed that always . As they wound slowly down in the winter afternoons , into the long whitewashed barn with bulging roof and windows under the eaves and the dovecote on top , with each little bell making a pattern , she saw them in great triangular blocks . Striding after them and lifting the big buckets of water for them , some natureness and some bulk enclosed in the bony body of a cow was perfectly clear to her . Without words , passing her hand across the back of her neck , she comprehended it and partook of it . Little calves and colts , in spite of their tiny unsteady legs , were now what they would become to her  --  they were power in the large . They could get up and walk away almost as soon as they were born . She always stopped to watch the wild white Camargue horses , those stallions running free like flames , flying over the hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she knew . She went when she was able to the Crau to see the polished black bulls raised there for the bullfights . There was something else . When she walked into Arles to church , before she went into the ancient Romanesque cathedral , she would stand close to the sides of the porch , looking up at spaces covered by scenes from the Bible . They were not stories to her of Jezebel , Tobit , the kiss of Judas , the people of Israel cross-ing the Red Sea . They were not stories nor stones . The way they came out of the wall arrested her . Heights and depths in seeing the world she knew . But these were higher and deeper by some trick that was left on her eyeballs . She always stopped before the panels which divided the Evangelists from the Saints , and looked along the friezes , tier on tier of shape , volume laid against volume , reason against reason . Over St. Andrew three horses ' heads were pressed close before one another solidly , and she always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely any relation to Jesus or Mary . But her relation to the portal was active , heavy , and concrete . When she went in and took the sacrament it was really the portal she was taking . Before the eyes of her bowed head , into that kneeling woman came not the blood of the Pascal Lamb , but the richness of the nature of form of three horses flying before a mistral of 1086 . In fact , she liked the cathedral best when there was no service , and she could consider undistracted , if such a word may be used , what she saw . Sometimes she walked in the cloisters or along the boulevard of Roman or Merovingian tombs . She had a natural relation to what men far away in the first , sixth , and eleventh centuries had taken from that stone and Ieft there . They had been part of the church they had made , and she too was an actual integral part of it as she stood there as much as one of its own shadows . She thought with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or vine she liked best on the baptismal font or the cornice . She would touch what she could reach and run her thumb along it . She liked shapes . Touch was what made reality to her . The world was a thing you touched . She had touched her children . She had put her hand on her baby 's head to feel the way the hair grows , and on Bella 's nozzle to feel the way the fur went in two directions . She would take up her lemons and onions and roll them in her hand . She knew that they were round far more than she knew that they were souror savory , They were real by her standard not by their color and taste but when she touched them . There was a painting over the high altar of St. Trophime , a stable where the Infant lay , and a cow was eating from the manger . But it was a flat smoke cow without bulk , almost a vapor , no size , no weight , and she seldom looked at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her or it was not solid . The profundity of existence for her was in the bulk and body of things . The reality of the geese was the way they stood out against the water of the pond in the hollow . The shadow from the door of the old grain barn falling on the straw , the sunlight and shadow when sun came in at the low window of the spring house , were solid to her as the timbers that supported them ; and this solidity was something that happened to her . She had partaken of the profound and primal seeking toward form that there is in every process of the world . Even the rustle of the corn was form that reached her as a whole , and the ducks that flew over her head , wheeling in a circle toward the north , reached her as a whole . When the dry mistral went through the narrow cobbled streets of Arles like an arrow it swept up a swinging center of rubbish . She always noticed that it was round . One February morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusual circumstance arrested her . In a corner of one of them she saw a man sitting with a board propped up in front of him . He was putting on it something which seemed a matter of great haste and necessity . She crossed the field and stood looking over his arm watching what he did . He was making her cows as they came down behind her against the shoulder of the slope . Except for the whitewash of the country spread on the stone of houses and barns , the Virgin and Child over the altar , and the Mater Dolorosas and Trinities in the chapels of St. Trophime , painting was unknown to her . But she had seen oil and her mind fumbled with this combination of colored whitewash with something thick which produced Bella and her field , in a way that looked like a field . She looked at the board on this man 's thumb with its squeezed rank of colors and she smelled . the tube he had laid down , trying to penetrate this matter with her body . The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyebrows of red grass . The wide-mouthed gaping ears were those of a striped clown . One eye feared you before it looked . Indrawn , suffering , it seemed to be begging you to wait , to be merciful . The other in the shadow was bold and cool . It gazed upon you with a disconcerting aggression , taking horn you all you had . It was like being looked at by all the power and grief and interest of life to be looked at by Van Gogh . She had no way to think about suffering . This man was almost as much the landscape to her as a barn was . But when he turned his head she saw a prominence under his look . A bold man , very strong . She knew gentleness and bad blood in , animals . One eye of this man had the steely look of her great boar . But the other eye was like the horse that always greeted her with a little neigh and lowering of the head . She was not afraid of the boar but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At noon she went back to see what he was doing . He was making another drawing of Bella in a notebook , a few lines before the brigade of her almond trees marching up the slope sugared with green , throwing their strength every way over the meadow with a flying light low on it . The painting he had made in the morning he had thrown down on the ground . When she returned from the work of the day at seven he was gone . But she saw the canvas of her cow and the swell of her home pasture lying in the corner of the field where he had thrown it . She picked it up and took it home . Her first reaction was that of French thrift . She would clean the copper pans with this strong piece of cloth . But when she looked at it as she walked on something ran along her back . He had painted the drama of sky which had been about her all day  --  that whitest white of clouds building as if they loved their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than white of egg . This was something she had already seen , only she had never hitherto seen it so much . She saw it enlarged as if she saw it now three times . She stared at this landscape , red as a hen 's comb , yellow as a goose 's bill , with the mighty force there which can drive bean shoots and rye out of the ground and push up tons of water . The surface of the canvas was cut under and lifted up , like the slope itself and the way the horses came forward from the portal of St. Trophime . A smile appeared on her face , half drowsy and half sated . Here was something she liked as she liked the slope and the porch . The next morning when she went down to her fields she saw that this man had already come . She crossed the field at noon and stood by him again . She had brought him a pot of goat 's milk in return for the red of a hen 's comb and yellow of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing , with the caution of the provincial which never lets you know that it has been struck . It surprised her when she looked over his shoulder that what he was doing was so different from yesterday . She looked hard at this Bella . It was the Bella she milked and fed with good grain . Because the need of talk was very great for him and he was quick to make a mental relationship , he began to talk to her when he had finished the pot of milk . " Things are happening up there , Mother , " he said looking up at the sky . " The very heart of France is heating here , " He began to work at once . It had snowed for two days after he came , he told her , and there was much to paint . Looking at the blot of shadow on the ground , watching him pour out of himself buckets of yellow into the shadow under Bella , she shook her head . " It 's yellower , " she said . She simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not true and she put it right as she would put right a grapevine that made a mistake . He looked at her with surprise , picked up his field book and one of the crayons in the box beside him , and gave them to her , half bemused with the idea that she saw something he could not see . But they did not mean to her  --  Draw . She shook her head . She was sowing the spring sowing every day , and the third day as she was going up and down , throwing the grain across with the full reach of her stride and her arm , she noticed this man there again . When she took him milk at noon she saw that he had put her into his study . She was there , planted in her land , sunk into it , sunk into her field , swinging her arm with the throw to get the right amount of distribution . Drawing his stool a little away from her , he asked her to stand still , and she consented , passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and assuming the look of a headstone . She began to take him milk every day . He tried to talk to her always when she came . His only connection with her was a railroad timetable which had landed him in that section of the earth , and that he happened to see in her field a cow with green under its nose . But since he was a man of sensibility , he saw at once that she deeply gave back an attention that was not without but within her . She scarcely ever spoke . In many days she said only " Yes , " " No , " and " What ? " Her entire relation to others consisted , it seemed , of these three words . But once she had said , " It 's yellower . " She had noticed as if she saw them with her hand the way a cow is hung on the front and back and falls away right through the middle . In the fields before the young were cast the big bulk was without shape and became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense of separation in Bella or Franchonette as if each were there an individual . One day when she looked over his shoulder she shook her head and said " No " so that the word " No " seemed something that locked behind you . She ran her thumb down that part of his painting where the cattle stood and took up the notebook and crayon he had given her some days before . But she could do nothing . She drew two lines and laid the book down . Van Gogh glanced at them , and laid the book down too on the stool . Then he looked across at the cow and took the book up again . She picked up a clod of the earth and tried to show him . He took it from her and began to model a cow . She went every day from this time to see what he did . If she could have been afraid she would have been afraid of him sometimes in those days . His ugliness and wildness and bold singularity would have made a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times as if his head were jerked by a rope . Sometimes his lips drew back from his teeth as he worked . But fear is the conscious part of a different nature from hers . She was too much tied in the great order for fear , which is an outside element , to have any way of touching her , He was not terrible to her . Watching him muttering , twitch. ing , these movements and faces did not seem as real as the matters he disclosed . It was only because he painted so red . He found in her something to paint . The way her nose was set on her face was material for an artist . She was a painter 's object instead of only an old woman in many skirts , the color by much washing ground into itself , so that it had become texture ; swinging her arm in a great sweep with her stride , the eyes faded with the sun , under a scooped-out straw hat with a tired bow at the front . Or she moved before him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to time . Toward five they began to pull the ropes on which they were tethered , and then to move together toward the barn . One trotted on in front . After some weeks he asked her to come to the studio and let him do a portrait of her . She did not go at once , but one day when she went into Arles peddling she climbed from her cart at his house . There was no strangeness in it . It was not different from her own house except for a floor of gorgeous red tiles . She had known this house for sixty years . She saw the room in two blocks when she went in , because a blind had blown shut at one corner and divided it by light and shadow . Then she saw the big easels at each end of the room and the platform and modeling stand . She noticed at once as she looked about , the hundreds of canvases stacked against the walls . The loose way the sketches were stacked was like the loose form of grain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the chair which was drawn up at the hearth . It was such a chair as was drawn up to every hearth in every kitchen of the Arles countryside  --  a strong chair with butter-colored seat . She looked at the painting of this thick chair with a pipe left lying on the seat and she went over at once and sat down on it with her mind . As she looked at it a sudden feeling that she wanted to sit on it and occupy it compelled her . She could not sit on the painted chair and she went to the hearth and sat in the real chair , seeking what she looked at . The number of the paintings amazed her . Amount pleased her with a peasant 's satisfaction in it . They bulked against the wall as her grain bulked in the barn . Some of the paintings were nailed up where he could look at them again and again , as she put up fine ears of corn . As he worked at the easel that afternoon , she sat with hands laid on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a table of people eating potatoes ; the bridge she crossed when going to Montmajour ; washerwomen on the built-out platforms of the Rhone , their yellow carts drawn up in a line ; old Jean with a cart of manure ; a churn , a pot of soup , and some shoes , lemons and a bottle of wine , pictures of the plain where the ground was the principal thing  --  everything whirling and rocking with creative flame in color so intense that it almost bounded forward from the canvas . She went to the easel when she grew tired of sitting still and looked . Van Gogh made a movement of rage and threw his palette under the table . Roulin , the little postman , came . He brought a letter . Bills fell out of it . Van Gogh read the letter through twice and then went away without speaking to her again . She followed him when she had seen that he was well ahead of her and not looking back . She had her delivering still to do of her fowls and brandy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carts and horses on the Rue de la Calade , stopping to look with a happy face at prints in a window , Iaden and doubled with canvas and paint and oils . Three boys were hooting after him the name of " the red fool . " She drove them off , shouting a flow of stern words . She pondered it all the way home  --  the canvas , the paint , oil , no food . When she went to his house some days later he scarcely noticed her . He was painting the way a shoulder breaks in a door . Something had fallen out of the letter beside bills . He was almost naked . He had thrown off one piece of clothing after another . His brush moved like a sickle . On one impulse unbridled and rich , he threw the paint to the canvas . Hunched over toward a sheet of cloth , dropping his brushes and picking up the palette knife , working in the color with a quill , squeezing whole tubes of azure into the sky , or green under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , massive , the chord of color advanced . The terrific shout and charge of his life an off his hand . Silence and painting . What was he doing ? She noticed that he was eating ships ' biscuit which lay on a chair he pulled toward him with his foot . She brought him a piece of her cheese the next time . He swallowed it without laying down his brush . She took from Van Gogh the idea that this making paintings was a crop . It was like the farm , work never done , sowing , reaping , adding thereunto . A wall of new pictures was there every time she went . He would set up a new still life as soon as the canvas of lemons was stripped off the frame and replaced . Watching the furious way he had of working , tearing sheet after sheet from his field book , beginning again , it was the way she watered , spaded , manured , covered , and the earth gave you back . The amount , the number of times he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her house sometimes for supplies on his way back from a day 's sketching . One evening he came to her barn and followed her up the ladder where she was pitching hay . She had forgotten him , and when she looked over her shoulder he was standing so close behind her that she felt suddenly the heat from his body . She just moved the basket for the corn with her leg between them and pitched another sheaf with her fork . When he saw that she was not in any way afraid of him he talked to her about the sickness . When lie was working particularly well it always came . He saw it cut suddenly across a day like the fall of a wall . It seemed as if in return for painting well you must go mad ; and since you must go mad , you were in return paid by Heaven with the beatitude of painting . Painting was the recompense . Sometimes he talked to her strangely about it . In lonely evenings it came . " Outside the door it is waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he were about to throw himself with all his might upon what was beyond there waiting quick as lightning for him only to go to the easel . Sometimes he could not get going . Turbulent , pursued , agonized , he was like a man hit who can not rise . Bleak despair the hope passionately pursued found futile , disillusion . " I am a man come home from the Congo and the Caribbees with a spoonful of sea water and a colored handkerchief . But , oh , Motherl How inexpressibly beautiful that field of yours is . " Then the immeasurable bliss of being a painter took him like a proud river . He would rush forward as if the Rhone were under his easel . Impossible to be grateful enough for this heavenly visitation that makes a man more than he is . He worked literally all day with a will fresh and bottomless . The factory was in full swing . He scarcely took time to eat and even would get up in the night after he went to bed to put something on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mother , that sometimes you must hammer it on the paper . You can not spare the tube , " and he squeezed whole roots and trunks from it . He had an irresistible desire to paint thousands . One had not eyes enough to see nor hands enough to paint . There might be one thing more powerful than all that threatened one , and it was painting . In those brave days , she came to understand that " a man becomes a painter by painting , " She watched rhododendrons grow on the easel with the leaves set in a whorl which vibrated as if it had just stopped turning ; cypresses in a light which increased them a thousandfold so that they scintillated on the heavy almond-laden air as in the aurora borealis ; landscapes where the sun and moon rose together in a night of stars big as signal fires . Even the light round the green-shaded lamp was made of some sumptuous depth of fact . She looked closely at them again and again , coming to apprehend something plus itself , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion and mental content . She was not herself an individual . What he did to her was not in her vocabulary . She had known no feeling other than for a thing itself . When the mistral swept the plain she was tied into what it did to everybody , a part of the landscape that was whipped by it . Her world had no individual mountains . It was level , as if before Ararats and Matterhorns had hardened in it . But now for the first time she saw an individual . She did not understand drama , but in this obscure woman was an audience for the scale of his nature . She began to compare him with the marquis , the bank teller who hung his look so sadly on your face when you pushed your book in through the cage window , with the captain of the Zouaves ; and to make categories . What Vincent Van Gogh meant as human being and as hero she discerned as if she moved back from him and placed him against the porch , the city , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to notice everything about him with a raised attention . Hostile , destructive , this thing that came was because he was dying of starvation and he needed care . He needed the good soup , milk , wine , cleanliness , order . The smallness of her equipment suggested these cures at once . From this time she began to appear regularly twice a week at his house when she delivered in Arles , and to clean the room when she came . She would move across it , through the disorder of drawing boards and portfolios , mahlsticks , cigar boxes full of empty tubes , all kinds of moss and branches and birds ' eggs , all sorts of farmers ' tools and old caps , and the can at which he had thrown things from across the room  --  cutting a clean swath of fastidious decency , disturbing nothing that was of moment . She noticed that he always drew his chair to one place in the room , and she put it there . As he worked he drank water from a big bucket , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw what she was doing one day . " Deuce take it , I am so thankful , Mother . It looks so real when it is scrubbed and clean . It is a young home in full swing . " Van Gogh scarcely ever smiled . Just to make him smile for a moment was a good thing . He often talked to her , over her head , the powerful agility of his mind which devoured every experience discounting her entirely . " I tell you the fault lies in the drawing , Mother . Drawing is the basic body . It must be drawn so that the signal man in his smock , with his little red flag , will think It is fine weather to-day ' . " She listened to him , getting what she had not been able to get in any other way . She often pondered as she walked back to her farm along the white road things Van Gogh had said . She had never known anybody like him . Indeed , in all the world , Fate had picked for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she went early across her fields she saw him on the plain that went to Aries . He was looking at her slope and the curve of the Arles road . When she went back that way again at night she found him standing still looking at it . It was the hour when what is sky comes down into the earth . The blue actually had come out of the sky and spread on the plain , so that it was no longer separate and a curtain . Everything was becoming unreal , and cooling , and passing into the dream . He began to paint just as she went along the wall . Suddenly she recognized and realized his thought . What thought means came to her as if it were come out of her without being conceived . It was a matter of thinking them . She too looked at the slope and the road . Constantly before , her life had been made of what was around her , like a glacier with great thick edge rubbing against what it passed . But now from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was the moment when experience takes a body , and destination of its own , and passes into a separate joyful boundless life . It had never until that moment occurred to her that what you experience you may do . When she wanted to build a fence she had built a fence . She had reaped when she wanted to reap . She went back across her field and hunted for the piece of clay she had thrown down the first morning , when she had tried to show him how Bella was made , and took the clod home with her . It was an August night boiling with heat . She sat down at once after she had bedded and watered the cattle and began to try to model Bella . She had to be in the barn all night waiting for a new calf . The calf came , a new calf from the cow . Trying to get on its legs under a corner of its mother , it almost stood up . She tried to shape it , the little heavy animal pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at what she was doing . She did not look at what she had . She stood with her eyes fixed on the calf . She was looking not at what she had done , but at the way a calf tries to get on its legs . She stood there , her knees sprung in her skirt , her legs set apart , making a triangle of herself like the black bulls of the Crau against the sky , throwing big pieces upon the bulk before her , working off at her side , watching the calf . As the little thing began to struggle up , her hands would close on the clay , forcing it to rise under the big bulk of Bella in the corner . It was a strange calf whose body came out of the lump . It would not hold together . The loam was too light . She was bothered by it all night and first thing the next morning she went several times to look at it . She had waxes to deliver in Arles in the afternoon and she went back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looked at it carefully . The man who did three horses back in 1086 told her with his stone tongue that a shape is governed by its volumes . After she had gone about a mile beyond Van Gogh 's house on the way home , she went back to the studio , pushed the door open , and went in . He was not there , and she looked at the clay on the modeling stand in the firelight without touching it and ran her hand round her neck . Then she took it home . She had known that she should cover her calf with a damp cloth because she had seen Van Gogh do that . It was too dry the next night to work on . But she did not care . She began another calf as soon as she had finished her bedding and feeding . From a piece left of the clay she did Elaine , the old goose . She did not need to look at Elaine . Elaine was in a fold of her brain the way her thumb was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night in the old grain barn by the dusty light from a lantern . She did the sow . She did a foal of one of the wild white horses of the Camargue , its head turned a little toward her . She did the wild , wheeling white stallions and the black polished bulls that are raised on the Crau for bullfights . She tried a cat but she could not do a cat . She was tied down to shape . A goose is solid like a wax model . She could do a goose . But a cat has paperiness andbutter in its bones . As she saw the gathering of a cat for jumping , or the long straightened-out line as it crossed the frosty field , she registered cat . But it had no character for her . She was interested in the character of a solid . Form was the virtue of objects she had seen . The district raised racehorses and she often had watched these beautiful creatures being practiced in light sulkies along the white road . But they were too evolved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She could not do a swift horse . The earthy body which had created form by waiting , which had bulked a child , tried other forms .

She was not trying to do anything from herself . She was trying to get It . What did she mean by this ? She could not make them like cows . They were terrible monolithic feeble cows she made , come out of the void , too heavy at the ends , which fell apart the next day . She did n't care . She was really trying to make solidness , and this trying was as solid and beautiful to her as stone itself . She thought only " That 's not ft " ; or " That 's It " ? pieces of thought which belonged to her mentally , and she put them on the bulk before her . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she liked them . She put certain ones up along the crossbeam of the barn , along with certain ears of corn she picked out each year and hung there to handle and look at . Now she picked the best of these , and from time to time she rubbed her animals on her sleeve as she would rub a fine ear . She did not know it was sculpture . She never thought of showing them to anyone . She did not know that people bought such things . She did not know she had a gift . She would go back each night happy when she could get an adequate shape , finishing nothing . In her nature something had begun to talk . The blankness , the uncertainty with which she worked at first became a growth of control . What she felt and the way she worked was as far as possible from the terrific shout and race to the summit of Van Gogh . There was no battle . She did them as she sowed with her arm . Sometimes she would feel happiness that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she had known only in bringing peace to the farm , and from her children when she had held them against herself , returning and melting them into her own body . The days and months of the summer went on . She was busy with her rye , fruit , the pressing of wine and oil . She could not on some nights keep awake even for an hour . The seasons passed over this part of the earth . Winter came and there was less work to do . The warmth of the big bodies of her cattle made her able to work in the barn for some time . Then she had to go inside to work beside the fire . Sometimes she worked all night in the single room of her house , the bent shadow falling across the table , the fire going out . She would rub her eyes . They shone against the rising sun . She had trouble about clay . She tried chiseling in wood . A chisel had to her hand something good in it . She tried cutting from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen menwork in stone with a chisel and hammer . She could imagine the form into the boulder better than into clay . She liked the resistance of the stone , and she would reveal a little sleeping foal half come out of this opposition . Her joy was great when she looked at a boulder after that . A whole plain of stone . Enough stone to last until she died . This went on for almost a year . She had passed beyond astonishment . Van Gogh stopped at her house sometimes on his way back from sketching about the country , to get milk and eggs . One March night he came very late . She had gone out to the stable where she had already begun to work again . He went out there when he did not find her in the house . He looked along the beam from one to another of her creatures  --  at her calf , the fifty cows , Elaine , the bulls , the sow , the foal . He took up in his hand the figure she had on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , giving some sort of snort , and looked at her . An expression came over his whole body that only one thing could bring there . His shoulders smiled and his legs smiled . " So , Mother , you also love God with the draughtsman 's fist , " he said gently . " What an artist is  --  That is very curious . How deep it is . It is infinitely deep . "
