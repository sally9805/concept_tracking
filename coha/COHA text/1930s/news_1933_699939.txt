txt Barred windows and guards surrounded Joseph W. Harriman last night for the first time since he was indicted for misapplying funds of the Harriman National Bank . He returned late in the afternoon , in clothes that were dripping wet , to the Regent Nursing Home , 115 East Sixty-first Street , from which he made his second escape on Monday . United States marshals lost no time in taking him into custody and haling him before Federal Judge Francis G. Caffey , who earlier in the day had forfeited the banker 's $25,000 bail and issued a warrant for his arrest . In less than two hours after Mr. Harriman 's return , a dent , uement almost as melodramatic as the conclusion of his first disappearance when he attempted to stab himself , Judge Caffey had committed him to the psychopathic ward at Bellevue Hospital for observation . This morning Judge Caffey will hear arguments for and against immediate resumption of the sanity hearing that the banker 's flight brought to a sudden halt . The probabilities were that the hearing would not be resumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harriman spent the thirty-odd hours while he was absent from the private sanitarium where he has been confined since his indictment last March remained a mystery which he was unwilling or unable to dispel . His account of his movements was vague and contradictory . Louis Manzione of 2,319 First Avenue , the taxicab driver whom Mr. Harriman hailed when he decided to go home , said he had found the missing banker on Seventy-first Street between West End Avenue and the Hudson River about 4 P. M. Mr. Harriman , the driver told Lieutenant Thomas Dugan of the East Sixty-seventh Street station , was carrying his panama hat in one hand and the gray jacket of his suit in the other . Describing his once wealthy fare as " wet and slimy looking , " Manzione said he at first " took him for a bum . " and was reluctant to let him enter his cab . The banker 's cultured voice won the chauffeur , however , and he stopped . As Mr. Harriman climbed weakly into the taxicab , Manzione said , a red rose fell from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor and Mr. Harriman did not bother to pick it up . " Step on it , " Manzione quoted Mr : Harriman as having said . " I just fell into the river off Seventyfirst Street . " Manzione said Mr. Harriman gave him two addresses , one of them on East Sixty-fifth Street , before directing him to drive to the nursing home . Glancing over his shoulder , the taxicab driver noticed a constantly growing pool of water on the floor of his cab . Doorman Helps Him In . In front of the nursing home Manzione stopped . still ignorant of his fare 's identity until a mounted policeman enlightened him and told him not to leave until Lieutenant Dugan arrived . In the meantime . John Quintell , doorman at the nursing home , paid Mr. Harriman 's 50-cent fare , adding 20 cents for a tip , and helped the ailing banker inside , where nurses took him in charge .

According to Robert Thayer , one of Mr. Harriman 's lawyers , the el- del-1y banker , who has been reading the newspapers in his absence , was indignant at all this . He insisted that he had not been to any of the places where he had been reported seen . " He says he has n't been on any ferryboats or in any lunch counters , " Mr. Thayer reported after talking with his client . " He says he spent nearly all his time in Central Park and that he has n't had anything to eat . " The lawyer said also that Mr. Harriman had denied telling the taxi driver who brought him home that he had fallen in the river . His clothes got wet from sleeping in the park , the lawyer said Mr. Harriman had told him . Mr. Harriman admitted , however , Mr. Thayer reported , that he had driven to the Liberty Street ferry immediately after leaving the sanitarium . He said he had taken a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he traveled to Central Park . Soaking Wet , Says Brill . To Dr. A. A. Brill , the psychoanalyst who is expected to testify that Mr. Harriman is mentally incapable of answering criminal charges , the banker told a slightly different story , in which he insisted , however , that he had spent nearly all his time in Central Park since running away . Dr. Brill had a. few minutes with him at the nursing home before Mr. Harriman was taken to court . " He was sopping wet up to the waist when I first saw him , " said Dr. Brill . " When he took off his coat I saw that his shirt was wet also . His coat was dry . He told me that when he left the nursing home he went to the Christopher Street ferry . He told me he went from there to Central Park and spent the night there . According to what he told me , he picked up the taxicab that brought him home at Central Park West and Seventy-first Street . upon his return to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from coronary thrombosis and arterio-sclerosis , was ordered to bed . Colonel William J. Donovan , chief of the attorneys defending him , hastened to notify United States Attorney George Z. Medalie that the missing defendant was back . Mr. Medalie promptly directed Raymond Mulligan , United States Marshal , to proceed at once to the nursing home , arrest Mr. Harriman and bring him back to court . Judge Caffey , who in the morning had agreed with Mr. Medalie that a bail bond was only an " idle ceremony " if its terms were not enforced , delayed his departure from the Federal Building for the expected arraignment . While the United States Attorney and the court were waiting for Mr. Harriman , Colonel Donovan telephoned Mr. Medane and asked him to agree to an adjournment until this morning . The United States ' Attorney refused to consent to delay , and just before 6 P. M. the United States Marshal emerged from the nursing home , with Mr. Harriman stumbling weakly behind him on the arm of Mr. Thayer . Wife Accompanies Him . The former banker was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under his eyes and he looked very tired . He presented a stolidly emotionless front , however , as the camera men fired volley after volley at him . Behind him , dressed in black , walked his wife , Mrs. Augusta Barney Harriman , who was to have testified for him at the hearing that was postponed because of his mysterious flight . She rode with him to . the Federal Building in the marshal 's car . When she got out of the car at the Federal Building her sensitive face was white and twisted as though in pain . Several times in court tears appeared on her cheeks and were brushed away .

If it can be made effective by a device that is humane the court is glad to adopt it . Bail has proved ineffective in this case and the court will accede to the request of counsel with the understanding that the court reserves the right to make a different order if it becomes necessary to make the process of the court effective . " Sanity Hearings in Question . It developed then that Mr. Harriman 's commitment to Bellevue , for a term that is as yet indefinite , rendered impossible his attendance in the meantime at hearings into his sanity . Mr. Medalie said there was no reason why the hearings should not proceed in the absence of the defendant , but Judge Caffey did not readily accept this view . He directed counsel for both sides to appear before him this morning to quote the law on the point and argue it before him . At the same time , he said he would hear arguments on Colonel Donovan 's motion to reinstate the bail bond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberty bonds . In deferring a ruling on the ball that he had forfeited in the forenoon , Judge Caffey said : " Bail is for the purpose of producing the defendant in court .
