FAMINE-Liam O'Flaherty-Random House . ( $2.50 ) . <P> In the summer of 1845 , on an Irish air long heavy with the smell of dung heaps , peat bogs and the personal reek of an ill-kempt and poverty-ridden citizenry , a new and more awful odor arose . Sulphurous , acrid , " like the smell of foul water in a sewer , " it came from the almost-ripened potato plants , lay so thick that in some places it was visible as a whitish cloud above them . Where it appeared , leaves turned first purplish-brown , then black ; stems withered , so that they broke at the touch , oozing a pus-colored liquid ; the potatoes , when dug , were soggy and black with putrescence , rank-smelling . <P> Modern specialists in plant diseases would recognize these ominous signs as symptoms of Phytophthora infestans , a species of fungus with rapid germinating properties and extremely virulent effects . To the half-savage , wholly uneducated peasantry , it was known simply as " the Blight , " and regarded as a hellish , heaven-sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against it . Its onset marked the beginning of perhaps the most bitter famine in post-medieval European history . <P> Ridden by heavy taxes and a feudal system of landlordism , pinched by the British corn laws ( which put a high tariff on imported grain , in favor of England 's home-grown wheat ) , the Irish had been reduced to practical subsistence on the potato , and when that crop failed whole counties were left literally foodless . Governmental remedial machinery was slow , graft-ridden , stupidly conceived . While the famine lasted . 21,770 people died of starvation , the total Irish mortality for the five years that ended in 1851 was close upon a million . The two most important results were : a desperate stiffening of the rebelliousness already inflamed by Wolfe Tone . Emmet , O'Connell ; a tide of emigration , chiefly to the U. S. , that in the next 50 years cut Ireland 's population of 8,000,000 in half . <P> Laid in the thumb-shaped spur of rocky land that juts down from the county of Mayo along the west coast of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just fails of being the epic of struggle and suffering its author unquestionably designed it to be . But for readers strong-stomached enough to endure an unrelenting account of human misery . Famine is a powerful and at times wildly moving novel . <P> Brian Kilmartin , bald , bony , hawk-featured tenant farmer on the hills above the village of Crom ; his sons Michael and Martin , and Martin 's newlywed wife Mary , are the principal characters . The story starts the year before the famine when the blight touched a tithe of the crop with the first dapplings of disaster . The damage was small that year , but it was enough to make the Kilmartins draw in their belts a little . Potatoes ( dug fresh from the ground in summer , stored in fern-lined earthen pits through the winter ; served boiled , with a bowlful of salt water to dip them in , for flavor ) were their only food .
