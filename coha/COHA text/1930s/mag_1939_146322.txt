THE BRIDEGROOM GOMETH-Waldo Frank-Doubleday , Doran ( $2.75 ) . <P> Waldo Frank , 47 , is an inverted Theodore Dreiser , a modern transcendentalist , a mystical Marxist . He is also , at times and in spots , a forceful novelist . Combining passion and penetration with plodding Joycean prose and purblind bookishness , he is a perfect layer cake of the admirable and the irritating . <P> His best book because it is his clearest and most interesting , The Bridegroom Cometh " dramatizes says Frank in flesh and blood the loss of the religious instinct in modern American life , and both the need and the promise of its triumphant rebirth . " It is really a sequel : all of Frank 's writing is focused on the search for a new religion . <P> The story 's allegorical heroine is an intense , average-looking girl named Mary , daughter of a hard-bitten New England religious fanatic . A literal believer in Christ 's Second Coming , in college Mary loses her faith because of a sociology professor , finds college boys a miserable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cultured Jew . Renouncing his comfortable world , she seeks the true faith in vain in a factory , among the Communists , in an affair with a psychiatrist . Salvation comes when she meets David Markand , hero of Author Frank 's last novel and Mary 's New-Adam counterpart . Through her love for him , plus a beyond-Communism social faith , she finds new symbols for her long-lost religious faith . <P> The Bridegroom Cometh better dramatizes Mary 's loss of faith than her rebirth . But it is provocative testimony to Author Frank 's thesis that U. S. life is deeply grained with religious tradition .
