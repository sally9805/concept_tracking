txt Suggesting Plane Equipment . It Is incomprehensible to me how men could suffer , as those men did in the recent wreck of the airplane in the Adirondacks , from cold surrounded by a forest . If they had no matches I can understand their not making a fire . But with matches , or even a cigarette lighter , it would have been easy to build a fire and be comfortable . They had no sae , but in a forest an axe is not necessary to secure firewood . I ' am speaking from experience . I lived three Winters out of doors , sometimes in forest , sometimes on plains. and I know that in a forest one can easily be comfortable . It would seem to be unnecessary to advise the airplane companies to provide an axe , water , matches and a small quantity of food as precaution in every airplane . The food is not very important , but the axe , water and matches are indispensable . F. S. D. New York , Jan. 2 , 1936.    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
