Nevada last week celebrated the 68th anniversary of its admission to the Union . No celebrant , however , was lank Governor Frederick Bennett Balzar , onetime railroad conductor , onetime six-shooting sheriff of Mineral County . He was in Washington , D. C. begging the R. F. C. to lend Nevada $2,000,000 . Most of the banks of his arid State were at an impasse . When the loan did not come through , Governor Balzar communicated with his Lieutenant Governor Morley Griswold . As a result of that communication , Nevada 's 91,000 citizens awoke from their celebration to find ' 19 of their 26 banks closed , $20,000,000 of their $30,000,000 in bank deposits tied up . Lieutenant Governor Griswold had proclaimed a 12-day moratorium on all obligations except taxes , had urged every bank to take ad vantage of it . The seven banks which decided to face all comers included Reno 's First National which sent to San Francisco for $1,500,000 in cash and announced it stood ready to pay $3,000,000 over its counter . When this halted an incipient run President Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it tomorrow , there is plenty of it ! " Also open were two banks in busy Las Vegas . nearest railroad town to the Hoover Dam operations . <P> Not one of the twelve banks owned by George Wingfield opened . It was this chain 's weakness which precipitated all the trouble . Banker Wingfield is a tall , powerful man with a shock of black hair shot with grey . He was born in Fort Smith , Ark. in 1876 , the year of the Custer Massacre . Before he was old enough to enter a saloon he struck out for Nevada . In Winnemucca he learned faro , poker , bird-cage and 21 . He was soon called " The Boy Gambler " and banked his own faro . He was in Goldfield during the 1906 boom , made a million dollars in mining stocks . His contemporaries in those days included the late Tex Rickard , who was running a gambling hall , and Charles Victor Bob , engineer-promoter . His gambling halls grew so large that his cashiers began handling $5,000,000 a year . Nevadans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State has ever had , for he remained there after having grown rich on its resources . The Nevada-mined fortunes of John W. Mackay , James G. Fair . George Hearst , James C. Flood , William G. Sharon and William S. O'Brien were mostly spent and banked in other States .
