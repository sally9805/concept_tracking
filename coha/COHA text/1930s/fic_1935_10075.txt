WE ARE BETRAYED " Are you really sure ? " he asked again . " Yes . " He saw in Neloa 's eyes that she was pleased and that she wanted a child . " It 's a hell of a fine mess !

This bringing babes in by the millions and letting them grow up in ignorance and filth ! This halfwitted notion that souls are waiting to be born ! It 's better , say these Christians , for a babe to be born hunchbacked or an idiot than not to be born at all . Is n't that a swell doctrine ? " " But ours wo n't be an idiot , " Neloa said .

Listen , darling , if a big family is an honorable thing we ought to canonize flies . " " Well , " Neloa said , " we'n have an abortion . " " No ! Abortions cost money . They 're dangerous .

Did you ever think of that ? " While Vridar was agonizing over this matter there came to him a letter from Washington , D.C. It invited him to join the air corps . A letter like his . own , he soon learned , had been sent to every athlete in this school . And he was flattered . He still hated war but he liked to be thought of as a candidate to its most difficult and dangerous service . It offered a dramatic way to die . Better to be set aflame in the air than to be rammed with a bayonet while stuck in mud . He went at once to be examined . Twelve athletes went with him and he was one of five pronounced fit . After being spun in the chair , he lay by a wall , sick through and through his being and as white as death . He thought he had failed but the captain said he was all right . " But wo n't flying make me sick ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the building and rushed home . " Well , " he said , trying to seem casual , " I 'm a flying cadet now .

" 4a WE ARE BETRAYED " Imagine me , " he said , " ten thousand feet up . A German blows up my gas-tank , I come down in flame , cremated and ready for the roses . " " Darling , please do n't go ! " " Do you want me to be a slacker ? " " But you do n't believe in war , you said . " " I do n't . I 'm not a Christian so how could I ? " " If you go what 'll I do ? " " Be a war widow .

He let her hair down and she trembled under his touch . " Do n't feel that way , " he said gently . " We all have to die sometime . If I do n't go they 'll draft me . " " You can go to jail . You said you would . " " No . You 'd hate me then . Everyone would hate me then . " " I would n't hate you . " " You think you would n't but you would . " And now , to hush her grief , he lied about his purpose ; he said he would not be killed ; he would be careful , he said , and he would come back to her when the war was done . " If you do n't , " Neloa said , " I 'll kill myself . " " That would be silly . What would our child do ? " " I 'll kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk that way . I 'll come back . " But Vridar did not intend to come back . He was taking the road to France as the road out ; and once there , he intended to plot his journey to death and peace . To return to Neloa and to resume his hopeless struggle with her  --  this he had no courage for . He could not endure her efforts to please him and to be what he wanted her to be . Her humility shook him . And in all hours he despised himself : his ambition and intolerance , his fury and scorn . And because he loved herWE ARE BETRAYED 43and because he was too sunk in despair to see anything but death he wanted to sacrifice himself . In this wish , to be sure , there was much vanity and self-pity , much that was cowardly and dark ; but there was also a mighty idealism , a great power to give . And to die and set her free was not only the most generous way he could think of but also , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courage and the strength . In March he was called and Neloa went to the station with him . She looked very lonely and deserted . When she kissed him good-by she did not break and weep but she shook in his arms . In his mind was one thought and one only : he was leaving this girl whom he loved ; he was riding out of her life and out of his own life ; and he would never see her again . His life was done , save for a few months , and this was the end . " Well , " he said , " I guess it 's good-by now . " " Not good-by , " she said , smiling at him through tears . " Just  --  just till we meet again . " " Yes , " he said , and his voice shook . " I 'll come back . " " I know it , " she said . He put hands to her shoulders . He knew that his own eyes were wet . " Neloa , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Never forget that . Never doubt that . " " I wo n't , " she said . " I 've been mean to you . I 've said mean and terrible things . But all the while I 've loved you as I love nothing else on earth . . . . And  --  and our child " He broke off , unable to speak . Her eyes still smiled through tears . " Darling , write to me often , " she said . " I  --  I will . " She looked at him , the tears falling to her cheeks. " 0 Sweetheart ! " he cried . She came into his arms and shook with grief . After a little while he tried to put her44 WE ARE BETRAYEDaway but she clung to him . He looked at a clock . " Darling , I have to go now . " " Oh , I know ! " " Neloa , I must go now . " She hushed her grief . When she looked at him now her eyes were wet and blind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked back , after a moment , and saw her standing alone . She was a picture of desolation and he stopped , having no power to go now . He stood here for a long moment and looked at her . Then he dropped his bags and ran to her and folded her in his arms ; and he kissed her hair and her wet eyes and her wet mouth . Turning away , he went to his bags and seized them and ran and he did not stop until he found the train . Sitting alone in one end of a coach he bowed his head and wept . Never in his life had his grief been more bitter or terrible . He heard the train singing under him and he knew that the miles were spreading away like a carpet behind . Back in the city , somewhere , alone , was this girl whom he loved more deeply than he loved himself . And in this hour , as in so many that had gone , Vridar thought of life : of all its loveliness and pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he thought his heart would break . Because in life , no matter where a man went , there was nothing to get hold of : it was impalpable and elusive , it was like smoke in a closing hand . You could see it and smell it and you could feel the deep wonder of its way ; and yet what was it but a wraith , when all was said and done ? He looked into his past and it seemed to be no part of him now . He looked back toward a valley and could not believe that Neloa was there . For everything was strange to the mind and heart ; and even the familiar , when looked at closely , was only the shadow of a thought . The world was a fog of light . It was a luminous circle , like a moon in a black sky ; and across the face of it , like a mist of cloud , moved the troubled wonder of humankind . But it was all no more real than a photoWEARE BETRAYED 45graph . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one of Neloa , and you could say , This is of a living thing , of a strange thing that moves and feels and breathes . But you could not believe it . You could only try to think about it ; remember only that you had touched it and smelled of it ; and try to realize what these meant . It was foolish to think of a building as steel and stone , of a mountain as earth and rock ; for they , too , were only shadows , hard to the touch . And a person sought , he hungered after , a reality that he had no vision for , no heart and no hands . He was a ghost that drank air and wanted wine . He was a vapor that tried to condense itself into the sea . And everything that he did and saw and felt was an outline for him , within a vague and bewildered consciousness , of the starved and futile limits of his being : as light is thinned to nothingness against black velvet , as pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet in itself , satisfied no hunger and awoke vast and terrible ones ; as if beyond the gardens of man 's world there lay an intensity of loveliness and smell , with intimations of it brought forth to the senses , as rainbows are brought out of the darkness of storms . . . . And so it was with humankind in all things . The brightest experience , the most poignant and lasting , hinted only of what lay beyond . A kiss hinted , as a lone flower did , of a garden somewhere ; and sexual embrace , reaching into depths veiled by the kiss , awoke in the soul a hunger that rose beyond flesh . But beyond sexual passion , man , in his search for the eternal , had never gone . He gave himself to it , as Vridar had , and he felt in its sudden power an imminent vision , as if a light would break . But the only light that came was a rocket that burst and went out . In the moment of its being , Vridar could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ core of an emptiness and the dark that flanked it ; and shadows piled above and below ; and far faint outposts of the boundless and the infinite . Then the night closed in and he was again in the inexplicable wonder of himself , in the46 WE ARE BETRAYEDheartache of a pinched and sick isolation . And he turned over and cradled himself in bewilderment and slept . Tonight , while journeying into the west , he felt more lost and unreal than he had felt in weeks . The sky of stars made him a stranger to himself ; and far lights set on the earth , and misty backdrops of mountain , and the ghostly nothingnessof gardens and hillsides and trees . Could it be true that in a distant house , gloomy and hushed , a man lay in sleep and breathed ? And if so , what did it mean ? Each star out there , he had read , was a vast white sun , tremendously larger than the earth 's own ; each was a gigantic sphere of heat and leapingcoronas , shooting through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean nothing to anyone : they were the cuneiform jargon of a scientific world . The only man who could bother with them , or find in them any beauty or use , must be one who looked upon himself as a mechanism : calling his eye a lens , his car a drum , his heart a pump . For any sensitive person life was allegory , and as astonishing to think of as his own face . Trying to reduce it to formulas and clockwork , to a codified pandect , was both futile and silly . That was like trying to anatomize beauty . It was as stupid and meaningless as kissing a woman 's image in a mirror . Once he had moved to kiss Neloa 's image , and had found , instead , that his own was there ; and this , it seemed to him , was a happy similitude for science . A man explored the inscrutableand came at last face to face with himself . . . . And after his heartache had spanned a few years he died . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His life was a small edition of the Bible , running from parable to parable ; and after he had found his Gethsemaneand Cross , death offered the vinegar and the book was shut . And the wise person , it seemed to him , would gather the aimless destinies to his own hands . He would close his story on the Song of Songs . Such , at least , he would do . He wiped his eyes and lookedWE ARE BETRAYED 47into the black night and shrugged ; and the shrug meant that he was renouncing life . Its mad tempests and turmoils , its inexorable dooms and tides , he would leave to those who followed the journey into the loneliness of old age . . . . But he looked again at the photograph of Neloa and kissed it and shook with grief . VIBERKELEY and the campus of the university here were lovely in March . Used to naked winters and the blizzards and slush of northern springs , Vridar looked round him in wonder at the fragrant gardens and flowering trees . It was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foliage and all the campus paths were bright with summertime . It would be pleasant , he reflected , to spend a few weeks in this tropical Eden ; and for an hour he followed winding trails , smelling the growth , or climbed a hill and looked westward to a great plateau of sea . But only for an hour was he at peace . When he reported for duty he was given common army equipment : a cotton uniform and a pair of infantry shoes . The cadets here , he had observed , shone like officers : they had serge uniforms , tailored , neatly pressed ; and they had trappings to match . When Vridar meekly protested , he was told that he could buy a better outfit if he wanted to . He signed for the clothes and gathered them in his arms and went to the barracks . He was full of misgivings and he was wishing deeply that he had not come . On the way to the barracks , he met Lars Ongin , his footballcoach . " Hello , " Lars said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This morning . " " How 's everything ? Can I help you any ? " Vridar looked at his armful of clothes . He looked at Ongin 's uniform . " Tell me , " he said . " Do I have to wear these things ? " " Hell no . You'n buy you an outfit . " Vridar wanted to ask what an outfit would cost . Well , no matter : he had n't the money for one . Among all these splendid fellows he would be , as he had been in college , a48WE ARE BETRAYED 49bumpkin in cotton and cowhide . In the army he had expected to find a democratic spirit ; but here , as elsewhere , the caste system prevailed . He entered the barracks and was assigned to a cot . Takingoff his civilian clothes  --  guiltily , lest his ragged underwearbe seen  --  he stored them in his shabby bag and strove to hide the bag . He put on his uniform and looked at himself and was appalled . The thing was baggy and shapeless . The leggings wrapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other cadets had shining leather and their shoes were long and polished ; and their hair and eyes shone like their shoes . Vridar now became aware that the cadets in this room were slyly watching him . Some were amused . Some looked vaguely astonished . And one , more friendly than the others , came to Vridar and asked if he could help . " I do n't know , " Vridar said . He began to sweat . He looked with shame at himself and then with wonder at this immaculate fellow who had spoken . " I guess , " he went on , trying to seem casual , " I 'll have to get me a decent outfit . ... How much do the damned things cost ? " He tried to speak as if the cost did not matter . He looked at his outlandishuniform and shrugged . A smart tailored outfit , the man said , could be had for about seventy dollars , including leggings and shoes . " You 'll need two outfits , " he said . " A man can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vridar said . " If I'n help you , " the man said , " call me . " " That 's nice of you , " Vridar said . " I  --  I  --  thanks a lot . " The man went away and Vridar sank to his bed , overcome . Seventy dollars !  --  and he had sixteen . Of course hewould be paid a salary ; but Neloa would need that , or mostof it . And even so , even if he spent from his salary , he wouldhave to dodge around here in cotton for a month . No : he wascaught . He had got himself into a pretty mess this time . So WE ARE BETRAYEDAviation , like fraternities , belonged to the sons of wealth . It was the aristocracy of murder . To him , and to the milIionsof common fellows like him , who owned only the clothes on their backs , belonged the infantry , the bayonets and dugouts and mud . For a long while he sat on the cot , wishing he could flee . When evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were preparing to shave . Everyone of them had a lordly outfit . And what did he have ? A cheap tarnished razor , a silly little brush that was losing its hair , and a chunk of handsoapthese , and a comb , with several teeth knocked out of it . He wanted to laugh . He wanted to stand up and say to these men : Look at me , fellows . I thought war was murder and that nothing mattered except guns that shoot straight and knives that are sharp . But even in war , I perceive now , fashion declares the mode and vanity goes over the top ... . Or he wanted to say : This cotton outfit is all I have and all I can afford . But it would n't do , I can see , for one of Uncle Sam 's aviators to be shot out of the air in duds like these . He must come down , tailored in wool and leather , with his shoes polished and his ears clean . . . . He followed the men to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at him , his brows lifting in gentle amazement . The stare would travel down Vridar to his shoes and then come back for a moment to his face . And Vridar , desperate , resorted as usual to clowning . He would give the man a solemn wink ; or , affecting astonishment , he , too , would look at his trousers and shoes ; or he would sag as if undone and look oafish and woebegone . But under his clowninghe was frightened and sick . Going softly to his bag he got his razor and brush and soap and hid them in his clothes . Then he hung about the washroom , waiting for a chance to be alone ; but no chance came . Once , finding the room deserted , he dashed in and was frantically lathering his face when a cadet entered . And now , instead of shaving , as he had meant to , he pretendedWE ARE BETRAYED ftto be washing only : he scrubbed his ears and neck , making a big racket , as if cleanliness and godliness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the man did . The man opened a regal leather case and drew forth shining tools , and powders and creams , and odds and ends of luxury that Vridar had never before seen . And the man 's way , leisurely , almost voluptuous , suggested that he had spent all his years in tiled bathrooms and Simmons beds . Returning to the barracks , Vridar hid his absurd tools and left the room . He went into Berkeley for a shave . On his way out he saw no one but on his way back he was hailed by a guard . The guard approached and stared at him . " Where you been ? " he asked . " Downtown getting shaved . " " Who gave you permission ? " " Permission ? I did n't know I needed any . " " What 's your name ? " " Vridar Hunter . " " All right , Hunter , you 'll be reported . " Vridar went to the barracks , feeling dark and awful rage . All around him now , men , half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their toenails ; some were brushing their hair with costly looking brushes ; and some , from big Gladstone bags , were laying clothes out . They were all superbly equipped , untroubled , at ease . Vridar shrank from them . He wanted a small dark room of his own where he could be himself . On the next morning he was awakened early and when he saw men around him he sprang from his cot . He dressed in frantic haste , trying to hide the fact that he had no pyjamas ; not knowing what would happen to him if he were late . Then he saw that men were making their beds and he tried to make his own . The other beds began to look neat and orderly ; but his own , in spite of all he could do , bulged and spread and showed clearly that it had been slept in . He52 WE ARE BETRAYEDwatched the deft movements of others . He yanked his outfit into its several pieces and tried again . And while he was on his knees , wholly engrossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At first he paid no heed ; but when the voice spoke again , it was sharp and furious , and Vridar looked round at the man . He saw a glittering officer . He saw that the other cadets were all standing like dummies of leather and serge . " What 's your name ? " the officer asked . " Vridar Hunter . " " When did you get in ? " " Yesterday . " " Say sir to me ! Get up ! " Vridar looked at the small pompous fellow but he did not move . A dark murderous fury was taking hold of him . " I said get up ! " Vridar rose to his feet . " Attention ! " Vridar looked round him , wondering how to stand at attention . " Get those heels together ! " the officer roared . Vridar clicked his heels . " Salute ! " Vridar made an awkward gesture . And then for a long moment the officer looked at Vridar 's uniform . His gaze was unpitying and hard . It traveled from Vridar 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ; and came back to his throat . Then the man 's gaze met Vridar 's and Vridar hated with all his strength what he saw in the man 's eyes . He attended classes but they were insoluble mystery to him . Drawings of engines , magnetos , carburetors  --  they were handwriting in a foreign tongue . He listened to instructors but he could not understand what they were talking about . The Eiseman G-4 magneto had secondary windings of the armature and primary circuits and distribution brushes , but the drawing of all these was as meaningless as Norse runes . There was talk of a thermal principle and a Bosch-Rushmore system and an Entz system ; of the Atwater-Kent polarity switch ; of primary intakes and auxiliary air valves ; of ballastresistors and field poles ; and Vridar , for all that he got out of it , might as well have been listening to a Moslem'sWE ARE BETRAYED 53prayers . The cadets around him , he observed , looked as if they understood . They made notes and drawings and they asked questions . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this for him were kindergarten stuff ; but his notes were a caricatureof the instructor and a sonnet to Neloa . I listen while these solemn asses nameThe p 's and q 's of war and hate and death . Enthusiasm rides upon their breath ; But out in France I hear the blind and lame , Or see the rotting carcasses piled highTo make the Morgan bonfire ; and I knowThat God somewhere now hides His face in woe Against the smell of murder in the sky . Dear Neloa , I can no longer see The face of Jesus in the human dream . His bones , I think , still hang in Galilee ; His heart is still there , spiked upon the beam . And now instead of aconite we set Against His lips the bomb and bayonet ! He drilled with the cadets and he was the only one here who wore a cotton uniform . He looked like the gawkiest recruitanywhere and he felt like it . Burning with shame , he fumbled in his movements , acting more like a wooden soldier than a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at him . And for ten days he suffered this spiritual agony . He drove himself from task to task , and with all his courage , he strove not to read the summary of himself in the eyes of another . War was murder , he reasoned , and it made no differencewhether a man was slain in cotton or in wool : death would level the derisions and give to every soldier the same quality of dust . " It 's a living hell , " he wrote to Neloa , " but54 WE ARE BETRAYEDI 'm trying to stick it out . The man who shaves with a chainstore razor makes as good a target as the man who shaves with a Gillette . . . . But at the end of ten days he could stand no more . He resolved to leave . If he could not get an honorable discharge he would desert : anything to be done with this stupid aristocracyin the shadow of death . And early one morning he presented himself to the commandant . Clicking his heels sharply he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was full of officers : they were all arrogant and glittering , plump and well-fed . They saw him , Vridar knew , but they left him standing in the doorway . At last a colonel , sitting like an overstuffed Napoleon behind a desk , looked at Vridar and spoke . " Well , what do you want ? " " I 'd like , sir , to speak to you . " " Speak . You still have your tongue , have n't you ? " Vridar advanced to the desk and stood at attention . A dozen officers roundabout were looking at him . He looked into the colonel 's cold blue eyes . " I want to leave this place , " he said . " Say sir when you address an officer . . . . What do you mean ? " " I mean , sir , that I 'm sick of this place . I want to be dis-charged . " A great silence fell . Not a man stirred and for a long moment not a man spoke . The colonel looked bloated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " he said sharply . " What do you mean by that ? " " I mean , sir , that I do n't like its spirit . " The officers looked at one another . The colonel looked at his staff as if to say , Did you ever see such insolence ? Then he stared at Vridar for another long moment . " Explain yourself ! " he said , his voice barking . " Do you mean , sir , that I 'm to say what I think ? " WE ARE BETRAYED 55 " Exactly ! And be brief . " " I think , sir , that these flying-cadets are a bunch of prigs . I do n't like their spirit . It 's bad enough to have social arrogance in civilian life . It 's ridiculous to find it among men who are facing death . I believe  --  " " That 'll do ! " the colonel roared .

He looked round him as if baffled and then with terrible eyes he looked at Vridar . But Vridar was not to be intimidated now . He had enlisted to seek death and a handful of officers could not frighten him . As a matter of fact , he enjoyed their consternation and rage . " Pardon me , sir , but you did not allow me to finish . " " Allow you to  --  to finish ! " the colonel shouted . " Youupstart ! I 'll have you thrown into the guardhouse ! " " Sir , that is all right with me . Do as you please . Butfirst let me finish . " The colonel stared at him , speechless with amazement . Other officers began to murmur . And Vridar , seizing his chance , went boldly ahead . " You see me , sir , in a cotton uniform . It 's all I have and all I can afford . My people are poor people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them " " That 'll do ! " the colonel roared . He banged a clenched fist on his desk . And instantly , like the blaze of a match , fury came to life in Vridar . Stepping closer , he met the colonel 's outraged gaze and he spoke savagely , his voice ringing . " I enlisted to fight ! I did n't come here to put on the dog ! I did n't come to strut around here in wool and leather like a damned turkey-cock ! And I wo n't ! " He paused a moment and then went furiously ahead . " There ought to be a democratic spirit here ! But there 's only arrogant pomp ! Andg 6 WE ARE BETRAYEDI hate it ! Do with me as you please ! Throw me in your damned guardhouse ! Take me out and shoot me for insubordination ! A hell of a lot I care what you do ! But you ca n't scare me with your damned glittering discipline and you may as well stop trying ! " He now shook from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonel as if stricken sank to his chair . He looked at his staff . " What , " he asked , " shall we do with him ? " " Discharge him , " one said . " We do n't want such men here . " " An honorable discharge  --  " Vridar began . " Shut up ! " the colonel thundered . " You 'll take what we give you ! And that 'll be more than you 're worth ! " " All right , " Vridar said . " Make it as dishonorable as you can . " " Harriman , " said the colonel , turning to an aide , " fix him up . " And the colonel rose like an old man and left the room . An hour later Vridar ferried across to San Francisco and walked down Market Street . He entered a building and presentedpapers and was given an honorable discharge and his fare home . And never before in his life , never in the years to come , had he ever felt or was he ever to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank whisky until he staggered , and then took a quart with him and found a railway station and entered a train . VIIN ELOA , meanwhile , had gone to her Antelope home . It was to these hills that Vridar was going now ; and when he thought of them he drank from his bottle or he brooded and cursed . Only six months ago he had left them , believing that he would never return ; but they had been with him all the while . In the geography of his doings , they were the great inland empire , surrounded by provinces of the strange . Of his spirit and thought , they were the enormous and hauntingconsciousness ; and no matter where he went , no matter what he did , they were with him . The river was still in his dreams . The Bridwell Place , the mountains , the gray hills , were a solemn darkness even in his brightest moments . But he was not returning to the bowl of his home . His father a year ago had stepped into conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adorned like a gypsy , had prophesied great things . The stars , she declared , had marked him for leadership . Looking at his hands , smellingthe barnyard in his clothes , she said he had been wasting his genius with binders and plows . For he had the stuff in him of a mechanical wizard and the stars were calling him to school . Soon he would own a string of garages from Lake Pend d'Oreille to the Utah line . And Joe forthwith had leased his ranch and with his brother Ike , to whom also had been granted a larger destiny , went away to school . With a raw and mighty enthusiasm he studied automobiles , from patching a tube to winding an armature ; and then with Ike , and one of the instructors of the school , he came to Idaho Falls and bought a garage there . His war profits in wheat had achieved all this . No : Vridar was not returning to his home but he was going back to the scene of his humiliations ; to the circumferenceof his shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BETRAYEDhe sipped from his bottle and tried to swagger , and he assured himself that he did n't give a good God-damn where he went or what he did . " Why the hell should I care ! " he reflected . " I 'll be shot before this war is over . In some gray morning I 'll be a scattered armful of viscera and legs . So why should I care ? " When he arrived in the Idaho city he bought a bottle of whisky there and then caught a ride with a farmer to Antelope . This man was from Star Valley . It was in Star Valley , Vridar remembered , that Harvey Kress lived . He offered his bottle and the farmer drank as if choked . " That 's darn good whisky , " he said , his eyes shining ; and drank again . " You know Harvey Kress ? " Vridar asked . " Harvey Kress ? Hell 's bells , yes . He 's a neighbor a mine . " " Oh . I used to know him . How 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I guess . This war , it 's makun us farmers rich . " " Is Harvey married yet ? " " Lord yes . He 's got two kids . . . Now this war , " the man said . " How long you figger it 'll last ? I hope it do n't stop for a while yet . You see how wheat jumped again ? " Vridar gave the man another drink on the Antelope flat and left him . He went down into the creek bed and sat there for a little while and drank . The whisky made everything unimportant and senseless . Out there in the Doole stable Neloa had told her tales of wrong ; but what of it now ? In a mad world , with bayonets in the bellies of men and with blood running like water , what difference did anything make ? There was an orgy of guns and gas , whisky and delirium ; and all else was pious whimwham . He would stay drunk all the time now . . . . He hid his bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire gate and knocked it down ; and as he went up the path , he saw Neloa in a doorway . She came running to him ; WE ARE BETRAYED 59and Vridar , convulsed by rage and grief and joy , threw his arms out and hailed her . " Stop ! " he said . " I want you to see the great American aviator ! " But Neloa did not stop . She came and put arms round him and put her face to his face and trembled with joy ; and Vridar grinned at the far reaches of hill and sky . " I 'm drunk , " he said . " Oh darling ! " She drew back to look at him . " Oh , you big silly goose ! " " I 'm drunk , " he said . " Ca n't you tell I 'm drunk ? " Neloa shook him and scowled . " You big silly fellow ! " she cried . " Shame on you ! " " I 'm not a bit ashamed . I like to be drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said ; and she tried to drag him to the house . " Do n't ! " he yelled . " You got a-listen to me . I 'm a drunkard now . I 'm gon na drink myself to death . . . . You want a drink ? " " No ! " " Well , all right . Come with me . I got a-have another drink . " But his threats were only childish threats and when his whisky was gone he looked around him for work . He went as hired man and Neloa went as cook to the Con Wote ranch . It was the most manorial of all ranches here ; and its manager , short and plump , gave himself feudal airs , as did his wife also , a huge woman with a heavy dead face . Lizzie Boe , now and then , would ask to have her breakfast served at her bedside ; and she would affect a yawning , luxurious weariness as if she were president of a bridge club . John Boe would dress up like a steeplechase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumed a vast and hungry interest in culture and in far strange things like the Italian Riviera and Mardi Gras festivals and Paisley shawls . Their big words , invariably mis-6o WE ARE BETRAYEDpronounced , and their allusions and dinner-table talk , they gathered from advertisements in magazines . At first they amused Vridar ; but more and more , as the days passed , they annoyed him . Their patronizing gestures made him furious . When at table they addressed their remarksto each other and took it for granted , it seemed to Vridar , that he was a dusty ignorant fellow who had never been to school . They spoke to one another as Mr. and Mrs. Boe . They murmured with small polite apology . And they often alluded to the time when , living in a town somewhere , they gave afternoon teas and played bridge . . . . " Anna writes that she 's visitun Europe this summer . " It was Lizzie Boe speaking . She yawned behind her napkin and turned to Neloa . " Uh  --  may I have another cup a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boe . " And will you pass the eggs to Mr. Boe ? " " To Europe , " said Mr. Boe . " That 's interestun . To the Italian Rivarah , I guess . " " Oh yes . She may go to the Rivarah . But not at first . She expects to visit Sweden first . Anna , of course , is Swedish . " " Oh , " said Mr. Boe . " Yes , I remember . " " Neloa , I think Mr. Boe would like another cup a coffee . " Neloa rose and served the coffee . " I thank you , " said Mr. Boe . He coughed a little and said ummm . He looked at his wife . " You remember the time Anna bid a gran slam in hearts ? That was  --  uh , when was that ? " " Do I remember ! I thought it was a despicable thing to do . We set her four tricks . That learnt her something . " Mr. Boe 's chuckle was mirthless and well-bred . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his saucer , " that mebbe France will rebuild the Reems cathedral . " " Oh , indeed ? I 'm glad to hear that . What a pity it was to muttilate such a lovely building . . . . Neloa , may I have coffee ? " WE ARE BETRAYED 6 rOften while riding a plow or while bunching hay Vridar reflected on the Boes . He had cherished the notion that countrypeople were , for the most part , unaffected and earnest and genuine ; and that city folk were evasive and dishonest and a little degenerate . These notions he had gathered from his reading . Poets  --  and novelists , too  --  were forever extolling the rustic , forever excoriating the urban . Country lasses in gingham smiled innocently from magazine covers ; scoundrels of the city sneered and smirked on the inside pages . The pastoral  --  traditiondeclared  --  was close to the heart of the beautifuland the true . Take the verse of Whittier and Bryant , of Shelley and Tennyson ; take the novels of Cooper and Hardy , as well as those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cowboy . It all told the same tale . . . . But now , in reflection , he wondered if he had been followinganother blind path . Was human nature much the same in every land and clime ? or did a man 's abode make either an angel or a rogue of him ? And if it did not , out of what had grown this monstrous tradition ? It was a notion which he had cherished but it was not a notion , to be sure , that he could uproot at once . Like his piety , like his hatred of meanness , it was a part of him : it had been assimilated into him like his food . And later , too , he was to fall upon the early novels of Willa Cather and of others and these were to make more difficult his road to freedom ... . The notion , nevertheless , flattered him now . He was of the country and it was good , whatever the truth might be , to regard himself as a more genuine fellow than his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter and felt at peace . But he had resolved  --  and this resolve was mighty and fixed  --  to accept no tradition without searching to its origin and purpose . To Neloa he said : " I think I 've been wrong . I think country people are6z WE ARE BETRAYEDprobably no more decent than city people . Look at these Boes , the wretched humbugs ! Would n't any man in the country , if he had a chance , be just as much of a tyrant and slave-driver as a man from the city ? I do n't know . But this I do know : I 'll figure it out . " This moment , this statement , marked the beginning of his repudiation of socialism . He did not know it . He knew only that he had come face to face with another problem of the first magnitude . And after a long moment of thought he added : " If I ever write novels about country people I 'll tell the truth . I wo n't simper and bellyache over them like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't all , " he said . " I 'm going to figure out what made Dickens and Hardy sentimental . " Neloa looked at him with unhappy eyes . " You 'll sure be busy , " she said , " if you figure out half what you say you will . You wo n't have time for anything else . " " I do n't care . I 'm going to know the truth . " Vridar 's wretchedness of spirit as the days passed here was caused by more than the priggish airs of this household . In every day while laboring in the fields he could see the Antelopecountry and the blue mountains of his home ; and he never looked at either without thinking of his dark and bitter years . During an afternoon he would brood upon these , and when night came and he was alone with Neloa he would often abuse her or reproach her or break her to tears . She had wanted to come here , he said . She loved this ugly desolateplace . Like her people she dwelt in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beyond . And he reproached her , too , for her loyalty to her kinsfolk . The Doole clan had the blood integrity of an Indian tribe . They banded together in their thriftless nomadic ways and every one of them , no matter how stupid or unworthy , dwelt in the clan 's bosom ... . WE ARE BETRAYED 63 " It 's ridiculous ! " he said . " Some of your people are all right . Some are n't worth shooting . And why stick like glue to every one of them ? I did n't marry your whole damned outfit . . . . " " You stick to yours , " Neloa said . " I do not ! Some of them , yes . But most of my relatives are n't worth a bowl of soup . And I mean bad soup . . . . Neloa , in God 's name grow up . Learn to look at human beings and see them for what they are . " And to all this Neloa gave her usual reply : " Blood is thicker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that distressed Vridar most was Neloa 's pregnancy . As the summer passed , he saw this slender queenly girl grow shapeless and stout . She looked , he reflected , as if she had swallowed a bag of wheat . And he was appalled . Never before had he seen a pregnant woman  --  at least he remembered none ; and when he stared at her , thinking of how graceful she used to be , he hated life and its dark blundering ways . Why , he asked of nobody , did God  --  if there was a God  --  employ such vulgar distortions ? In the lowest forms of life cells divided and multiplied themselves without agony and blood ; and in flowers , in trees , the way was beautiful and clean . But the more civilized the animal , the more ghastly was its way of aborting its kind . A cow or a mare looked stuffed , but only as if overfed ; and in birth they suffered pain ; and the delivery , though hideously unclean , took only a little while . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was spry and alert and good to look at . But a woman swelled up as if bloated with some horrible disease ; and she went to bed and sometimes screamed all night ; and she almost lay with death when the ordeal was over . The infant was so incrediblyraw and ugly and helpless that it sickened Vridar to look at one . His violent distaste for pregnancy and birth was , to be64 WE ARE BETRAYEDsure , abnormal : it reached back along dark and devious ways to his childhood years ; but even so , his attitude , as he discoveredlater , was shared by many men . A year ago he had read a book by a doctor , addressed to married folk ; and this author , to Vridar 's utter amazement , had eulogized in two ecstatic pages the gentle roundness of a woman 's abdomen . He had written : " A husband looks at this full rounded cradle and reflects that it is the noble and miraculous repository of daughters and sons that will soon shout in angelic innocence around the nursery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown the book down and kicked it . What experiences , in heaven 's name , could produce so monstrous a simpleton ! His distaste , he realized now , was related in some fashion to aesthetics : it was a lively and morbid awareness of pain and ugliness , and of life reaching in its terrible ways toward the sun . To what other sources it led , he could not be sure in these weeks and he did not care . IIe asked only why rapture , why the passionate beauty of flesh mating with flesh , should lead to such deformity as this . It was a gruesome circumstance , discolored , like leprous flesh , with the diseased blood of the horrible . It was kin to a pellagrous face , and to shrunken limbs and idiocy and bloat . Neloa never again would have the alluring body of girlhood . She would get broader in her hips and she would take on fat and indolence . After her breasts were given to suckling , they would hang , in a year or two , like empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tied to an inexorablebiology , and delivered body and soul to the greedy selfishness of motherhood , expected a man to be the same kind of lover after a child came . They expected him to forget the monstrous swelling and the sickness and the blood . . . . " I 'm going to enlist , " he said to Neloa . They were in their room alone . She rose and came to him , and Vridar , after looking down at her body , wanted to laugh . He did laugh ; and his laughter was so wild and bitterWE ARE BETRAYED 65that she shrank from him . He left the room and passed through the house , still laughing , and the Boes stared at him in amazement . " Give me my time ! " he cried . " I 'm leaving . " And he went laughing into the night . VIIIO N THE next day he went with Neloa to Idaho Falls and lived with his sister and parents in a dark scabbed apartment . But he did not enlist . Neloa wept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our child , " she said , " you should think of it . You should at least wait until our child is born . " And Vridar thought of the child . He owed a duty to the unborn and he resolved to wait . " But ten to one , " he said , " I 'll be drafted . That 'll be a hell of a note . " " Maybe the war will stop , " she said . " Stop ! Not as long as there are fools like me to fight for the Rockefcllcrs and the Morgans . . . . Early in August Neloa went to her Antelope home . She wanted Vridar to go with her but Vridar said she would be all right . He did not want to be with her when the child was born . He remained in the city , now helping in the garage , now walking the streets in thought ; and one day there came to him an Antelope farmer and the man was so agitated he could barely speak . " You know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a father now ! " Vridar stared at the man . " What of it ? " he said . " A lot of things are fathers . " He shrugged . " Likely as not you 're a father yourself . " Like a man deeply lost to himself Vridar entered a car and was driven to Neloa 's home . As he walked to the house everything about him seemed crazy and unreal . His fatherhood , it seemed to him , was very silly : it was a blunder that he ought to be punished for . Because here he was , a man be-. wildered and driven , with a child on his hands : with a son , born of his own haunted flesh and blood , and looking into the66WE ARE BETRAYED 67awful wonder of life . He would be killed soon and his child would grow up and marry and breed ; and it was all nightmare . . . . He entered the house and looked at Neloa on the bed . Shewas very white and weak but her eyes were radiant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never heard hervoice ring so . " Darling , come and see ! " He went over to the bed . He stared at the hideous squirminginfant . Neloa , watching his face , spoke again . " Darling , are n't you glad ? " " I do n't know , " he said . " It 's a boy ! " she said . " Are n't you glad it 's a boy ? " " I ca n't see it makes any difference . " Neloa reached out and grasped his hand . " Are n't you going to kiss me ? " He stooped and kissed her . " And now kiss him ! " " No , " he said , scowling at the child . And he added : " What an ugly brat ! " " Oh darling , how can you say such a thing ! He looks just like you . Mama says he does . " " Like me ? " he said ; and he stared hard at his son . " I know I 'm an ugly bastard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " " He has your nose . He has your mouth . " " Nonsense . " " Look , he has your ears ! " " Fiddlesticks . " " And darling , his eyes are just like yours . Look . " " Oh , in God 's name ! All babes are said to look like their parents ! That 's more damned fool vanity ! " " It is n't . He looks just like you . " " I tell you he 's the homeliest brat I ever saw ! " Neloa looked at Vridar and the smile left her face . " Darling , are n't you glad ? " " I do n't know . It 's easy to get kids . It 's not so easy68 WE ARE BETRAYEDto give them a decent life . . . . I suppose you wish you 'd had twins . " " I do n't . I want just one . " " Like hell . You want enough to fill a barn . Every woman does . " " Vridar , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just kiss him once . " " No . " " Darling , please ! " He bent swiftly and kissed the warm pink flesh . Two weeks later he was called in the draft . For a long , while he stared at the summons .

At once came Mertyl 's reply . WE ARE BETRAYED 69DEAR V. B.Of course I 'll go . I 'll be right up . It 's all a dog 's life anyway but God knows it 's worse sitting here and reading about what is going on over there . Do n't feel so damned blue . Your old pal will soon be with you and we 'll jump into the lousy fracas and mix things to suit ourselves . Give my love to Neloa . MERT . Mertyl came on the next train and went with Vridar to the Board . " My brother and I , " said Vridar , speaking to the sheriff , " want a-go together . Is it all right ? " The sheriff looked thoughtful and pulled at his drooping mustaches . He turned to other members of the Board . " How about it ? " he asked . The other members looked thoughtful , too . They all looked , indeed , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They asked a lot of questions . " Why , " said the sheriff solemnly , " does your brother want a-go ? " " We want a-be killed together , " Vridar said . " Urnph , " said the sheriff ; and he looked at Vridar and then at Mertyl as if to read their thoughts ; as if to learn whether they plotted seditions and insurrections . He became suspicious . He turned to his fellow members as if to say , " I think I smell a plot here . " And to Vridar he said : " Are your parents  --  well  --  umm , what nationality are you ? " " American . Is n't that enough ? " During a long silence the sheriff played with his westernmagazinemustaches and stared at Vridar . " Your parents German ? " he asked at last . " German . What difference does that make ? " " Answer me , " said the sheriff , speaking out of terriblo dignity. 70 WE ARE BETRAYED " One grandfather was German , one was Dutch . Onegrandmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . About ten drops , " Vridar said , " to the gallon . " " I see , " said the sheriff . " Yes . Well " " One greatgrandparent , " Vridar went on impatiently , " fought in the Revolutionary War . Another fought in the War of 1812 . My father 's father fought in the Civil War . " " Oh , he did . Which side ? " " The North . But what 's the difference ? " " A lot , " the sheriff said . " You say you 're partly German ? . . . Well , I 'll tell you . We 'll consider the matter and let you know . " An hour later he called Vridar by telephone . It would be all right , he said . Mertyl would go in place of Arthur Hammondwho had been summoned in this draft . In this evening Hammond came to Vridar . He was a huge flabby fellow and he broke and wept . " It 's sure swell of you ! " he said , blubbering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have a little baby " The word baby left him bursting with sobs . Vridar looked at him in pity . " I 've a child , too , " he said . " Two weeks old . " " You  --  you have ! That 's too bad . That 's too darn bad . " " And besides , " Vridar went on , " it 's my brother who 's taking your place , not me . If you want a-thank anyone , thank him . " Hammond wrung Vridar 's hand and went to find Mertyl . He shook with gratitude and joy and offered gifts . " I'n never thank you enough ! " he cried . " Gosh , I never can ! " To celebrate his good fortune Arthur Hammond borroweda shotgun and went duck-hunting . He caught influenzaand two weeks later he was dead . Vridar went to Antelope to say good-by to Neloa . She was up now but she was very thin and white . She was with him only an hour . She wept in his arms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jestingly of war and said he would be back soon . He held her at arm 's length and stared earnestly at this face which he loved . And again he thought , I 'll never see her again in life or after death . This is the end . He went over to the bed and kissed his son . He came back and kissed Neloa and turned away with his heart breaking . . . . On his way back to the city he drove his father 's automobilewith such reckless speed that he ran over a hog and a half-dozen chickens and lost the cushion from the rear seat . He bought whisky and drank until he staggered in wild fancies ; and most of this night he walked up and down the streets with his drafted comrades , looking for a brawl . To one man and another he said , " Do you believe a just God approves war ? " And the men , seeing that Vridar was drunk , said they did not . But at last he came to a man who rebuked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Beat it before I smack your ears down ! " " Answer me , " Vridar said , grinning . " Do you  --  uh  --  believewhat I asked you ? " " Yes ! " " Then , " said Vridar , still grinning , " you 're a cockeyed liar . " The man sprang to the fight but other recruits , also dizzy with whisky , led the warriors to a garage . They went into the part where cars were overhauled and where buckets of oil stood about and grease was deep on the floor . And here they fought . Of this fight Vridar could remember nothing clearly . When he came to himself he was in bed ; and his clothes , piled on a chair by him , looked as if they had mopped a ton of grease . He left the bed and dragged Mertyl after him . " Get up ! " he said . " Our train leaves in an hour . " An hour later they stood on a platform and watched a great tram roll in from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave no sign of grief but when he tried to say72 WE ARE BETRAYEDgood-by the word stuck in his throat . Prudence smiled through her tears . " Be careful , " she said . " I know you 'll come back . " " We will , " they said . " Well , good-by ! " " Good-by ! " " Good-by ! " And they swung up to the coach and were gone . IXBESIDES Vridar and Mertyl there were nine recruits , all bound for Fort Rosecrans at San Diego . Vridar had been placed in charge . With his proteges sitting round him he studied their faces . They were all country youths , the sons of farmers , and they were all simple and earnest and homesick . Not one of them had ever been forty miles from his front gate . Vridar was touched by their sober roundeyed bewilderment . They were boys lost to their mothers ; they were fightinggrief now , and each was fighting in silence and alone . In their own township , in their own small world , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but now they were off to war and all their bravado was hushed . And what Vridar saw in their eyes aroused in him all that was most generous , as if he were a father , as if these were his sons . When noon came he led them to the dining-car . While he stood in the entrance , looking for tables where they could all sit together , the chief steward came to him and spoke sharply . He said they were blocking the passage and asked them to move and Vridar flushed with rage . He had observed the deference paid to well-dressed diners ; but he and these lads were only ignorant fellows , going to die for their country . To the men behind him Vridar said , " Come on ! " and they moved in a body down the aisle . All the diners stared at them and Vridar hated what he saw in their stares . Their eyes did not say , " Here are some more soldiers , offering their lives . Steward , make room for these men ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunch of gawks ! There ought to be a separate place for them to eat ! " Vridar and Mertyl sat at a table for two . He told the men to sit where they could and they fell into seats . One7374 WE ARE BETRAYEDof them , a strapping youth who looked sunbaked and unwashed , sat across from a haughty woman who stared at him in amazement . The fellow met her eyes and then , abashed , looked at Vridar . " It 's all right , " Vridar said , speaking so the woman could hear . " If she does n't like you she'n get out . " The woman rose and left the car . Another youth , who had been writhing under the manicured gaze of the man who faced him , bolted across the aisle and fell to the seat . Then they all grinned at one another and waited for food . Other diners , Vridar observed , were bowed to tables and served at once . " The sons-of-bitches ! " he said to Mertyl . " We do n't matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . " Mertyl , too , was furious . " Go to the steward , " he said . " Tell him if he does n't hurry up we 'll throw him off the train . . . . Go on ! " " Well , wait a minute . " " You 're in charge of this bunch . Go on ! " Vridar rose and went to the steward . " Why are n't we served ? " he asked . The steward looked at him and Vridar wanted to strike the man in his teeth . " You 'll be served , " the steward said . After Vridar and Mertyl had eaten they slyly placed twenty-five cents under a plate . This gesture on Vridar 's part was cowardly . He despised social gratuities and he had never tipped before . And when , hours later , the men came in to dinner , he was amazed to learn what a quarter had done . Because now the waiter smiled at him and at Mertyl and served them at once . The other men had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food and waited . " We made a mistake , " he said to Mertyl . " Tipping , I mean . " " Let 's get rough , " Mertyl said . " No , not yet . " Twenty minutes passed before food was brought to theWE ARE BETRAYED 75other nine . And when it came , Vridar , looking at the rations , saw that they were only half as generous as they had been at noon . He knew the meaning of that : these men had not tipped and they were being rebuked . And this unspeakable insolence aroused in him , as few things could have done , a murderous rage . He went to the head steward . " Listen , " he said , and his voice shook like his body , " I 'm in charge of a group of men who are on their way to France to be shot . They did not tip at noon because they 've never heard of tipping . And now they 're served only half the food they should have . " He paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " The government is paying for their food and they 're going to get it . This is what I mean : we 've been drafted to fight and we do n't give a damn when the fighting starts . Do you understand me ? " The steward looked at him and his blue eyes darkened . " Do n't they have enough ? " he asked . " Go see for yourself . " Shaking all over , Vridar went back to his seat ; and the men looked at him , their eyes questioning . " It 's all right , " Vridar said . " They 'll bring you a decent meal . If they do n't , we 'll throw them off the train . " Two waiters came and bore the food away . They returned with heaped dishes and the men grinned like schoolboys and ate . When they arrived in San Diego it was pitch dark . A sergeant met them at the station and led them away , and as he went ahead of them down a black street he barked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fog . They entered atugboat and were taken across the bay ; they climbed a steep , difficult path ; they came to tents on a hill . A few minutes later Vridar lay on his small cot and looked at his brother . " Well , " he said , " we 're in it now . " " Yes , " Mertyl said . " I'n smell the canned horseflesh. " 76 WE ARE BETRAYED " And the beans and saltpeter . " " God yes , the saltpeter . " " Let 's learn to smoke , " Vridar said . " We 'll be hellish soldiers if we do n't smoke . " " And drink and chase women . God help any girls who stray around here . " " Yes , " Vridar said solemnly , " God help them . They 'll learn what a soldier thinks of . " Vridar fell asleep , thinking of his brother . Mertyl was not the pious lad of two years ago . With one gesture he seemed to have thrown away all his ideals and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next morning all the recruits for Battery D , 26th Artillery , were called into line . Lieutenant Jacks , commanding officer of the Battery , looked at the men . Vridar looked at the men , too . Some of them were from Idaho and Montanaand California but most of them were from New Mexicoand they were a dark and sinister lot . Many of them looked like Indians and halfbrecds . . . . " Can any of you men use a typewriter ? Put your hands up. , Vridar thrust a hand up . He glanced to right and left and saw that he was the only man with his hand up . Jacks came over to him . " Are you a typist ? " " Yes sir . " " Come with me . " Vridar went with him to a tent . " Sergeant Strumm , this man is a typist . Find out if he 's any good . " Sergeant Strumm was paunched and bowlegged and had a pudgy red face . His blue eyes were whimsical and kind . ... Vridar sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men watched . " You 'll do , " Strumm said . " You 'll be company clerk . " When Jacks left , Strumm talked to Vridar as man toWE ARE BETRAYED 77man . This was a lucky break , he said . The clerk did n't do much : he had a soft and lazy job . In a few days Vridar would be a corporal , and he would become a sergeant when the Battery landed in France . And all this flattered Vridar . He looked about him and began to feel like a corporal . He sat at a table and typed reports and letters and he fancied himself in reverie as a brigadier-general . Two days later two stripes were sewed on his shirt-sleeves and on his coat . He was Corporal Hunter now and he fairly ached with power and dignity . But his joy was short-lived . A week passed and there came to him , in an awful moment , the appalling truth of what he had done . It was Mertyl 's eyes that awakened him . Because Mertyl , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two privates in the ranks , together side by side . And in those eyes when Mertyl came in from drill Vridar saw contempt and pain and in Mertyl 's mouth he saw bitternessthat made his heart ache . Vridar went at once to Sergeant Strumm . " I do n't want this job , " he said . " Please get another clerk and reduce me to the ranks . " " Now what 's the matter ? " " I want to become a common private out in the field . " " Gonococcus ! You 're the clerk and you 'll stay here . " " Sergeant , please do this for me . Listen . My brother came with me . He came instead of another man so we could be together . Honest to God , I never thought when I took this job ! And I do n't want it ! " " Do n't be a fool , " said Strumm . " You 're the only typist we have . " " But I do n't want it ! I 've been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ca n't be helped now . Jacks would laugh at you . " Vridar left the tent and went to Lieutenant Jacks . He saluted . He stood at attention and waited. 78 WE ARE BETRAYED " Well ? " said Jacks at last . " Sir , I do n't want a-be company clerk . I want a-be a common private with my brother . " Jacks was amazed . " You 're a corporal , " he said . " Sir , I do n't want a-be a corporal . Please reduce me to the ranks . " Jacks grinned faintly and looked at him and Vridar didnot like the grin . Jacks was a huge fellow who had been anall-American guard in football . He was brutal and arrogant . " Corporal Hunter , " he said , " go back to your work . " " But , sir , you do n't understand . My brother took the place " " Corporal , did you hear me ? " "  --  took the place , " Vridar went on desperately , " of another man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranks . Please , sir Jacks rose from his chair . His face was dark with anger . " Corporal , there 's no place for sentimentality in war . Go on back to your work . " Vridar went back to his tent and he hated his work now and he hated himself . He would have given anything , even his life , to take that hurt look from Mertyl 's eyes . But he said nothing to his brother . This was his folly , his traitorous blunder ; this was his shame . And now , as in his childhood , he drew the pain of it into himself and it was never told . To Strumm he said : " All right , make an office flunky of me . But do n't think I wo n't fight when I get to France . I was n't drafted to pound a typewriter . " " You 're a strange bird , " Strumm said . " Most men would jump at your job . " " I do n't care , I 'm in to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " To be killed ! What the hell , are you crazy ? " " No . But I mean that . " WE ARE BETRAYED 79Strumm began to whistle . " Listen , " he said , after a moment , " I like you . I think I'n trust you . I want a-tell you something . . . . " Alonzo Strumm , top-sergeant of Battery D , had been a soldier for nine years but he was not a soldier . He was a poet and a maker of dreams . He loved books . He read Dante and St. Francis and Hindu philosophy and in his soul he built empires of the fantastic and the far-away . He was the only officer whom Vridar liked . Every man in the Battery liked him , and some , after a few weeks , loved him ; for his whimsicaldiscipline said , " Obey orders , you jackass . Life is a battlefieldand you may as well fight in the army as anywhere else . . . . Do n't take it seriously , fellows , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Strumm would smile . " I want a-tell you something , " he said now . " I 'm in love . You ever been in love ? " " Lord yes , " Vridar said . " Fine , " said Strumm . " You 'll understand . " He gave Vridar a cigarette and studied his face . " There 's no place in the army for love . A man in the army is supposed to eat saltpeter and beans and pretend he 's a steer . . . . You taste the stuff in your chow ? " " I guess so . I taste something . " " That 's it . We buy it by the ton . " He studied Vridar again . " I 'm in love with a married woman , " he went on . " She 's a doctor 's wife over in San Diego , the swellest woman you ever saw . . . . You married ? " " Yes . " " Her name is Dorothy but I call her Dolly . And she 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Strumm paused . Vridar looked at him and waited . " Now what I want a-tell you is this : it 's against orders but I have to see her . Out on the hill . In the brush , just like a guilty schoolboy . . . . I want you to help me . " " Sure , if I can . " 8o WE ARE BETRAYED " When I 'm gone , if Jacks comes blustering around , wanting to know where I am , you make some excuse . I 'll do something for you sometime . When we 're in France . You might want  --  but I guess you would n't . . . . You say you 're married ? " " Yes . " " Well , so am I. My wife 's in Seattle . But a man ca n't love a woman if she 's in Seattle and he 's in San Diego , can he ? That sounds pretty bad , I know . But this is decent betweenDolly and me . Do n't get the idea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinned . " Army life is hell , " Strumm went on . " But if a man can get away now and then to a bottle of whisky or a woman When we get in France I 'll do something for you . . . . Army life , Vridar , is a lot of pomp and a big mess of beans . But you 'll get used to it . " Strumm rose from his chair . His manner changed swiftly and he swung to Vridar . " Corporal Hunter , is that report ready ? " " Yes sir . " " All right , Corporal , you may go now . " But there was none of the dreamer , none of the poet , in Lieutenant Frederick Jacks . He was brawny and scowling and arrogant and all the men despised him . He disliked Vridarand he chastened him again and again and their scorn of one another became frank and open . One afternoon a sergeant entered the tent and spoke to Jacks and left . " Corporal Hunter , go tell Sergeant Adkins I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hailed Adkins . He delivered the message and returned and saluted . " The fellow , sir , says he 'll be back in a minute . " Jacks swung in his chair and looked at Vridar . His thin smile was a leer . " Listen , Hunter , you 're in the army . Do you know that ? " WE ARE BETRAYED 8 t " Yes sir . " " Then what do you mean by calling Sergeant Adkins a fellow ? " " Why , " Vridar said , " he is a fellow , is n't he , sir ? " Jacks rose to his feet . He gave Vridar a long and unpityingstare . " Corporal Hunter , there are no fellows in this army . They are all in college . In this army there are soldiers and officers . Do you understand that ? " " Yes sir . " " All right . Now go tell Sergeant Adkins I desire to see him at once . " Vridar left the tent , hot with shame and rage . But two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but toward army life . He sat at his typewriter to work . In the machine was a paper , and Vridar saw that it was a letter and he read the salutation and the first line . It was a letter from Jacks to his mother . After hesitating a moment , Vridar swiftly read the letter and his amazement grew as he read . DEAR MUMSY : The longer I stick around in this cockeyed army the madder I get . I hate the whole mess . All my superior officersare overbearing fools . When Colonel White comes around he bawls me out and tries to make me look cheap . It 's the same with the others . Nothing that I do is right . Nothing pleases them . To hear them tell it my battery is the worst in the army and I 'm the most inefficient officer between here and Verdun . White and all the other stuckup asses come parading around to show off and it gets under my hide . I wo n't stand it much longer . One of these days I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mouthful of gold ... The letter was unfinished . Vridar went to the entrance and looked out . He read the letter again and his astonishment81 WE ARE BETRAYEDleft him witless . During the whole of this afternoon he could think of nothing but the implications in this letter . For two days he pondered them . Then he wrote to Neloa . DEAREST GIRL : The other day I got the surprise of my life . I 've been trying to figure out why Christians who profess peace tax themselves to death to support armies and navies . I thought in the first place it is because men are n't civilized ; and they are n't . They do n't love peace . They love danger and feuds . That 's why ships are n't sunk and soldiers are n't sent home to mind their business . And another reason is the profit : munitions-makers are the war-makers ; but , darling , they probably go to church and say prayers and donate to cathedrals . Human ingenuity in insultingGod offers endless food to wonder . And a third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away to fight . Being the fools they are , I suppose they ca n't help it , or these halfwitted societies like the D.A.R . As long as women would rather give birth to a soldier than a poet , we 'll have bigger and lustier wars . But the most important reason of all I 've just stumbled upon . Being a man , I blush to name it ; for men , my dear , are indescribably vain and petty and love nothing so much as a position of authority over their fellows ; and in such positions they are , of course , nearly always tyrants and brutes . They love to give orders and make men jump through loops . They love to swagger and put on the dog . Note the outlandish monkey-uniforms of kings ; the plush and padding and glitter of religious dignitaries ; apes starched to a fine stupidity at formal dinners . And all this is , I see at last , the biggest reason for war : it serves male vanity and greed on a huge scale . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sweat under discipline is the knothead at the top : Pershing probably now twists in his polished boots , since he is under Foch ; and Foch is the only murderer in the whole outfit who does n't have someone knifing his self-esteem . I 've been hating Lieut . Jacks because he 's an overbearing fool . But no longer . I see now that his superior officer makes him jumpWE ARE BETRAYED 83like a circus monkey ; and so he makes us jump ; and I 'd be making someone jump if I could . I confess with shame that when I was made a corporal I began to feel my oats . It pleased me to reflect that I outranked most of the army and had privileges not given a private . My self-love shot up like a toadstool from a dungpile . But not any more . I want to get back to the ranks where a man is a target and God , poor fellow , is on both sides . Is n't it amusing ? And there 's something more : I smell it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the " Huns " do n't get me I 'll figure that out , too . Over in the German dugouts , my dear , are some poor frightened devils waiting for me and the rest of us ; wondering why war has to be ; and at the top , driving them on , are , unless I miss my guess , a pack of sexual degenerates . I make this guess , too : those hottest crusaders for war in this country have never had a good orgasm . Smile , my dear , but the truth is still strange and Napoleon was nothing but a stinking runty impotence . " I do n't know when we leave here . Before Christmas , anyway ; and within a year I 'll have driven a bayonet into some pitiable fellow or I 'll be pushing up weeds . I 'm not cocky enough to suppose that I 'll push up daisies . Only the officers , I think , do that . The smell of the sea is glorious . I wish we could sit togetherout here on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and draw a sky of flame after it . And we may sometime . There 's a little flu here but I 'm careful . And darling , keep cheerful . We take life as we take a physic ; and then we sleep . Your VRIDAR . XBUT Vridar was not unhappy during these weeks . His spirit was reckless and fatalistic , as was that of the men around him ; and only from such a point of view , he began to see , was contentment born . In two months he gained fifteen pounds in weight ; and Mertyl advanced steadily from a hundred and fifty-three pounds to a hundred and eighty-six . The brothers ate together , notwithstanding the stripes on Vridar 's arm ; they hogged their food and grinned ; and they were always first to offer their tins for a second helping . And a mood of fellowship , of comrades sealed to a commondestiny , took hold of Vridar . . . . O-ver there ;  --  O-ver there ! Send the word , send the word o-ver thereThat the Yanks are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere ! In a spirit of brotherhood he looked at these men . He liked all of them and he felt something deep and wordless in this new order that bound each to each : And we wo n't come back till it 's o-ver o-ver there ! When he went to the canteen for sweets or tobacco , or when , during the evening , he prowled with the men up and down the tent-aisles , his soul reached out to them in a common and mighty bond . He had not changed toward war : he still hated it and the greed that fostered it ; but there was somethinghere , something in the heart of this company , that reached beyond slaughter to the clean . . . . 84WE ARE BETRAYED 8 5Goodbye sweet-heart , wives and moth-ers , It wo n't take us long ! Do n't you wor-ry while we 're there , It 's for you we 're fighting too ! So goodbye Broadway , hel-lo France ! We 're going to square our debt to you ! Because all these men were singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if joy were a chamber in their hearts . And Vridar surprised himself , again and again , by bursting into song . Melodies and words ran in endless meaning through his thoughts and his dreams . Any former time , when looked at in memory , came to him now as a strange dark silence , with music dying far away , like imminent storm when a lark is hushed . And he marveled at this new spirit which defeated analysis and lay , in spite of blood and death , in the realms of the beautiful and the good . " There is more in war , " he wrote to Neloa , " than I thought . It is all that I said but it is more than that . There is something beyond definition , as in religion there is something beyond the empty ritual and the prayer ; as in poetry there is the greater reach , the untouched wonder , beyond the poet . But what it is I can not tell . It is in war but no more a part of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a force that purges , or so it seems to me now ; but I am confused , I can not grasp the thing I feel . Something is taking hold of me. . . . 0 joy ! 0 boy ! Where do we go from here ? But after a few weeks Vridar fought against this possession of himself by a power which he could not understand . His detachment , his spiritual isolation , was being drawn as rivers draw their streams into the common journey . He was not here to be a uniformed mannikin , jumping like a robot to the enemy 's trench : he was here to go to his death clearly86 WE ARE BETRAYEDand calmly and to observe how he went . He wanted to see , to study , this enormous process of annihilation , and not to be snuffed out , waving a flag : no , but to keep his mind intact and watchful , his spirit aloof . And to recover this detachment again he refused to sing . He retired to a margin and he watched , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . He saw , vaguely at first , but more sharply as the days passed , that the training of a soldier , so unirnplicit to the casual eye , was very devious and cunning . On the surface these men were clothed and fed and drilled ; but under the surface they were stripped of their decency , their scruples ; they were led step by step to their heritage of the brute . The only emotions called forth were primitive and fundamental . Because these men , exiled from all tenderness , lived and breathed in the spirit of the feud ; and as they gained in health and strength and fatalism , they hungered for a brawl . They wanted to go to France and they wanted to fight . And in one event and another , Vridar saw their savage hearts , their dark and unadorned animalism , made clear . He saw , for instance , the malicious cruelty of the company surgeon . When the men passed in single file round a room to be inoculated against typhoid , Vridar , while moving slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a large heavy face and upon it from time to time lay a devilish grin . It was the face of a man whose brain was the nimble and sardonicservant of a dark and impetuous heart . When a soldier flinched under the needle , the surgeon 's joy was as unmistakableas the epaulets on his shoulders , He thrust more deeply , it seemed to Vridar , into the flesh of those who were scared ; and once , when a man twisted suddenly under the jab , the needle was broken off and the surgeon probed into the flesh with tweezers . Three men fainted while Vridar was in the room . The first of them sprawled as if shot . WE ARE BETRAYED 87 " Take him away ! " the surgeon roared . Two corporals dragged the man out and threw a bucket of water into his face . The man came to , gasping and yelling ; he was set on his shaking legs ; and he left the room with something in his eyes that went like a knife to Vridar 's heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the surgeon , lookinground him , " what 'll you do when you get a bayonet in your guts ? . . . All right , next ! " Vridar resolved to be very steady and unafraid . He offered his arm and the surgeon pinched the flesh of it between a powerful thumb and finger . Then the needle came like a stab of lightning and two inches of steel were buried in Vridar 's arm . He looked at the man and grinned . After Vridar had left the building he heard a man scream . It was not the thrust of the steel , he reflected , that bedeviled these men . It was the cruel cynical face of the man who plied the steel . It was the vindictive gesture in a world that had become friendless and strange . The inoculation made him sick . Never before in his life , save mildly with smallpox and measles , had Vridar been ill ; and now he thought he would die . Fever flushed him and lifted its hot violent nausea to his throat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to Mertyl . " Tell Strumm I 'm going to stay in bed . " " Are n't you going to eat anything ? " " God no ! " An hour later Strumm came to the tent . His face was sympathetic and his hand on Vridar 's brow was the hand of a friend . " What 's the matter , Corp ? You sick ? " Vridar turned a hot face to the light . " It 's inspection this morning . I do n't suppose you'n get up ? " " I would n't get up for Pershing himself . " " Well , all right . The Major will bawl you out but I guess you'n stand it . . . . Anything you want ? " " A gallon of ice-water. " 88 WE ARE BETRAYED " You ca n't have it . Want some coffee ? " " Thanks , it would be all right . " Coffee was brought and Vridar drank it and vomited . " Take it away ! " he said . A little before ten o'clock Vridar heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tents . Vridar lifted a flap and peered out . Men on both sides of the aisle were standing at attention , with everything about them polished and scrubbed . The flaps of every tent were thrown back to show the good soldierly discipline within . And here Vridar lay , the solitary blot on an immaculate parade . . . . " What 's the trouble in there ? " a voice asked . " Lieutenant Jacks , why is n't this tent in order ? " " The man in there , sir , is ill . " It was Strumm speaking . " Ill ! What 's wrong with him ? " " A little typhoid , sir . " The Major came to the tent and raised a flap . " You there ! " he cried . " Are you sick ? " Vridar affected sleep . IIe breathed deeply so that the Major would see the blanket rise and fall . The Major entered the tent and roughly turned Vridar 's face to the light . Vridaropened his eyes . " Why are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You do n't look sick to me . " The Major laid a hand on Vridar 's brow . " A little fever . Do you think you 're sick every time you get a little fever ? " " No sir . " " Sergeant Strumm , give this man three pills . " " Three pills , sir ? Yes sir . " The Major left the tent . Vridar looked at the ceiling and grinned . Major Dockworth was small and plump and Vridarwondered why undersized men were so arrogant and pompous . He thought of Napoleon and turned to the wall . And even in the eyes of Mertyl , who had been a quiet and inoffensive youth , Vridar saw a dark lusting . Out of a slenWEARE BETRAYED 89der stripling had grown a powerful broadshouldered man , and Mertyl , sensing his new power , carried himself defiantly , neither seeking trouble , nor yet avoiding it ; and one evening at mess he ran into more than he was looking for . He was in line with Vridar behind him when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line ahead of Mertyl . Mertyl looked round at Vridar . " Did you ever see such damn gall ? Here , hold these . " Vridar took the mess-kit . Mertyl stepped out of the line and with all his power he smashed into the halfbreed and floored him . The man leapt up and turned and his face was the ugliest snarl Vridar had ever seen . " Go to the end of the line , " Vridar said . " You 've no right to push in here . " The man shrugged and went down the line . Two hours later Vridar and Mertyl were sitting in their tent . The flap was raised and a Mexican face peered in . " Come on out , " the face said . " What you want ? " Mertyl asked . " I want you should come out . " Then another face appeared . It was that of the big half breed . " Come out , " the man said . " We 'll finish this thing . " Mertyl rose but Vridar sprang up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said turning to the halfbreeds . " We 'll be out . " The faces disappeared . " I do n't trust them , " Vridar said to- Mertyl . " They 'll knife you . " " Well , let 's go out , " Mertyl said . They went out . They saw the halfbreed with a half dozen men around him . " Come this way , " the halfbreed said . " Where ? " Mertyl asked . " Just back here . Just over the hill . " Vridar led Mertyl aside . " They 'll kill us , " he said . " This 'll have to be a fair fight . " " You 're an officer , " said Mertyl . " Search them . " 90 WE ARE BETRAYED " No , they 'd gang up . I 'll report it to Jacks . " " No you wo n't ! " said Mertyl . " Do n't be a fool ! Go back in the tent . " Mertyl hesitated . " Go on ! I 'll arrange the fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the halfbreed . " I 'm an officer , " he said . " I suppose you know that ? " The halfbreed shrugged . The contemptmade Vridar furious . " Obey orders , " he cried , " or I 'll have you thrown into the guardhouse ! Stay here till I come back ! " He went to headquarters and told Strumm of what had happened . Jacks swung in his chair and listened . " Where are they ? " he asked . " Near my tent , sir . They 're waiting . " " Bring them down here . " " Yes sir . " Vridar went back to the tent and told Mertyl and the halfbreeds to come with him . Jacks had put a dozen men to work . Under a hanging light they were roping off a squared arena . Jacks came over to Vridar . " Where are they ? " " Here , sir . My brother and this man . " " All right , " Jacks said , " strip to your waist . " The two men stripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were ordered into the ring and soldiers came to watch the fight . " There 'll be no rounds in this fight , " Jacks said , ' addressing the warriors . " You 'll fight until one of you has enough . And I mean fight . All right , Sergeant , let them go . " Vridar stood by the rope and looked at his brother . Mertyl was a little pale but he seemed grim and determined . The big halfbreed , muscled like a gladiator , looked at no one but Mertyl . His face was sallow and unpitying and unafraid . And in this fight , there was no feinting , no guarding of belly or face : they drove their blows with murderous fury . A more wicked bone-crushing fight Vridar had never seen . It sickened him . Soldiers crowded the ropes , howling likeWE ARE BETRAYED 91devils , urging the men to bloodier efforts ; and Vridar shook as he watched . More than anything else he wanted to leap in there and take Mertyl 's part . He had done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been more unalterably fixed . When he saw the halfbreed strike Mertyl in his teeth , spilling blood , or when he saw Mertyl writhe from a driving smash in his stomach , Vridar babbled with anguish , as if his own son were being slain before his eyes . And then , without realizing what he did , he vanished under the rope and soldiers grasped him and drew him back . The men fought for what seemed to Vridar a long time . They were both bloody and exhausted and they staggered like drunkards or fell under their own blows . " Shall I stop them , sir ? " Strumm asked of Jacks . " No ! They wanted to fight . Let them fight . " But in a few moments Vridar saw two men enter the ring . Each carried a pail of water and one drenched Mertyl and the other drenched the halfbreed . The two warriors , gasping , stricken , looked around them . " That 'll do , " Jacks said . " Get back to your tents . " Vridar leapt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He led his brother to the tent , one arm around him , and wiped the blood from Mertyl 's face . " I 'm all right ! " Mertyl said impatiently . " He did n't hurt me ! " " I thought , " Vridar said , " he knocked some of your teeth out. , , " No ! I tell you he did n't hurt me ! " " All right , I 'm glad he did n't . " Vridar stared at him . Was this , he asked , the timid lad who had gone to school in Annis , in Poplar ? It was hard to believe . Army training had given to him the heart of a wolf . A few minutes later Rollie Pitkin came to them . Rollie was a slender youth who always looked frightened . Sometimeshe went into his tent and wept and Vridar heard him92 WE ARE BETRAYEDweep there and he wanted to take this terrified lad to his breast and hush his grief and fear ... . " Listen ! " Rollie said , whispering . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard them half breeds talkun . I wanted a-tell you what they said . " " All right . What did they say ? " " They plan to kill you both . I heard them say it . When we get in France  --  " " Oh . When we get in France . " " Yes . They 're plannun it now . . . . I thought you should know . " " Thanks , Rollie . Thanks a lot . We 'll keep our eyes open . " Rollie quietly left the tent . The brothers looked at one another and grinned . " Well , " Vridar said , " so that 's it . They 'll do it too if they can . " Mertyl shrugged again . " That , " he said , " is a game we can both play . " Vridar sat by Mertyl and put an arm across his shoulders . He patted his arm as he used to do when they were frightened lads in school . I must get back to the ranks , he thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the great loneliness and heartache of his past . He would have died for Mertyl . His love for his brother was as deep as his love for Neloa and for either of them he would have died . XI0WHEN Vridar was with Neloa he reproached her but WHEN away , he felt for her only great tenderness anda wish to cherish . He poured out his heart and his love to her in passionate mad letters ; and her letters to him were the only thing that he lived for . He read them over and over until he knew them by heart and with frenzied idealism he built them into the core of his life . On a day early in November when his departure for France was near he went over a hill , taking her letters with him ; and sitting where he could see and smell the rolling gray tides of the ocean he read them again . DEAR HEART : Well , another lonesome old Sunday has about dragged itself to a close and I am still able to smile . Agnes has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Keep the Home Fires Burning " and some more songs like them . When I hear any of the war songs I get lonesome in spite of all I can do . Funny , is n't it ? I always think of you . I get lonesomefor you and just wish so much that you could be with me . Dearie , when you write again tell me how you spend your Sundays . Are they the same as every other day ? Your father has been preaching to Agnes all day trying to make a Mormon of her but I 'm afraid he did n't accomplish very much . Sweetheart , have n't you taken any photos since you got down there ? I wish you would take some and send them to me . If you only knew how much I love you and how I love your letters you would steal time to write to me every day . I love you , love you . Oh , sweetheart ! . . . DARLING Boy : I do n't know what is wrong with your mother and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misery for themselves9394 WE ARE BETRAYEDand every one around them . But there , I do n't want you to think I am complaining . I 'm just telling you how things really are here . Babe and I are well and happy so do n't you think we are n't . Do you know yet when you will leave ? I got a basket and baby is sleeping alone now . Your father said to tell you you can just expect to sleep alone when you come home . He said if the babe ca n't sleep with me you ca n't either . I 'm afraid he would have an awful time stopping you , would n't he ? Darling , when you come home I 'm going to stick to you like glue .

I suffer when you suffer and I always shall . I thank God for your love and pray the time will come when you can forget the old Neloa , who is dead now , and live with and love your own . It was your love , dear , that made me what I am now . Sweetheart , I will swear to you that if I were to be hanged and could save my life by telling a dirty story , I could not do it . ... Vridar looked away at morning sunlight on the sea . In Salt Lake City six months ago she had amazed him with the simple statement , " I 'll bet I know as many dirty stories as anyone you ever saw . " And then , cunningly , he had led her to confession ; and such utter mental filth he had never beforelistened to . It was erotic leprosy , stinking and foul . And he wondered then , as he had wondered so many times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which came the privy-house legends . He had stared at her then with amazementgathering within him ; and he reproached her furiously ; and he rebuked himself for loving one with an unclean mind . . . . But all this he forgave and forgot . He believed deeply now that Neloa could not tell an obscene story to save her life . And he sighed and read again . WE ARE BETRAYED 95DEAREST HEART : You know what my dream is now ? To go somewhere far away where there will be no memories of the past to haunt us . I want a little home with just you and baby , a small world of our own . I do n't want ever to see the Antelope country again and when I die I do n't want to be buried there . I do n't want to be buried in Idaho for I hate the place . And I have learned , dear , that we can never live around your folks or mine . I am getting fat , really . I now weigh 138 with my suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty good ? I am weak and my nerves are bad but do n't you worry about me . If I got sick I do n't think they 'd let you come . I wonder if I 'll see you before you see France . I must , darling , because I love you with the truest strongest love a woman can have for a man . And do n't feel so sorry because you have been what you call mean to me . No matter what you have said or done I 'll always love you . I 'll always love you no matter what you do . Just think of our future , for we shall be happy , dear . Oh , so very happy when you come home ! And I know you will come ! Love , darling , with all my heart ! YOUR NELOA . Vridar read these letters and others and kissed them and sat in thought . He felt a great sadness today , not alone for himself and Neloa but also for the men in this camp . They were dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Half the soldiers were stretched out on cots and some had died . Rollie Pitkin , that pathetic and terrified lad , was in a box now and on his way home . The big halfbreed was close to death . To Neloa Vridar wrote : I know , dearest , that you forgive , because forgiveness is one of your golden virtues ; but just the same , I am sick to death of the shameless way in which I abuse you when we are togetherand my awful dark worship of you when we 're apart. 96 WE ARE BETRAYEDGod knows I have tried to fight out of it and see my way clear ; but there is something in my blood or training that is more terrible than nightmare and I ca n't see what it is . And I 'm so damned weary of trying . And I believe deep in my heart , and this I 've told you before , that it would be better for you if I were dead . I could easily die here for the Flu is everywhere ; but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I love you , love you , and want to see you again . . . . As company clerk I take care of the mail . Some of the letters do n't have return addresses on the envelopes and I have to open them to get the address . I do n't have to read them but I do . Listen to this one : Dear husband mine , you do n't know how me and baby miss you . Every day is just like a awful dream . I try and keep busy but I just think about you all the time and it seems like I could n't stand it . I try and keep busy making things for you . Honey , did you get the socks I sent ? I 'm making you a sweater now . Honey , did you get the cake I sent and was it nice and fresh ? Tell me what you 'd like . I dreamed about you last night , honey .

And now , my dear , Iisten to this one to Private Harry John-son : MY OWN DEAREST : I 'm just so excited I can hardly write . Daddy says the War wo n't last much longer and that you 'll be home for Christmas ! Imagine , dear ! He says he knows it 's true and I ca n't believe him but something deeper than reason tells me it is so . And , Harry , do you know what I 'm doing ? Oh , you would n't ! You men ! I 'm making my wedding-gown . Harry , dear , I 'm making my wedding-gown and mamma isWE ARE BETRAYED 97helping me . Dearest , let 's be married on Christmas day ! You 'll be my wedding-gift . And the gown , it 's just too darlingfor words ! And wo n't we be happy ? And then I think , Oh , but maybe he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , I know you will ! I 'm fluttering like a bird today . Please write and say I 'm not foolish and my father is a good prophet and you 'll soon be here . Love , dearest , worlds and worlds without end ! VIRGINIA . Again Vridar sat in thought . He looked far away to the Pacific and his eyes were wet and blind . Barely able to see what he wrote he finished the letter to Neloa : Over these letters yesterday I wept like a silly fellow and I 'm weeping now . It 's heartbreaking . Because , my dear , both John and Harry are going home . They are both dead . As ever , VRIDAR . XIINEWS of the Armistice was a great rumor here . Is it true ? the men asked and nobody knew or nobody cared to tell . Death had entered this camp and after it , hope of peace like a wind from the ocean , salty and clean . But the men did not sing and they had not sung for many days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the tents . And how many were dying in the huge gloomy hospital down the hill ? To Vridar came one and another . " Is  --  is Latrielle dead yet ? " " I do n't know . I 'll see . " And again : " Corporal , can you tell me about Huff ?  --  Arthur I-Tuff . Is he  --  ? " " Yes . " Sometimes the question was only a whisper . Sometimes the men turned away , choked by grief . And Vridar , fighting grief , too , and feeling as never before his kinship with his fellows , would talk with Mertyl . " War is war . What difference if a man dies in a bunk or a shellhole ? " " A lot , " Mertyl said . " It 's a more decent death in a shell-hole . " " Yes , you 're right . . . . How you feel ? " " Fine . How do you ? " " All right yet . . . . Mert , I have a secret . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? Thank God . " " You sure you feel all right ? " " Yes , I 'm all right . " " It would be hell if one of us got sick and left behind . Watch yourself . " But they did not leave for France . A great soberness fixed Strumm in thought and he moved like a man sentenced to death . " The damned thing is all over , " he said to Vridar . " An armistice has been signed . " 98WE ARE BETRAYED 99 " You mean  --  you mean we 're not going to France ? " Strumm swung to him in sudden rage . " God damn it , you heard me ! You heard me ! It 's all over , I tell you , it 's all over ! " And like a man from whom all hope , all interest , had gone , Strumm left the tent and disappeared . " It 's all over , " Vridar said to Mertyl . " The war has stopped . " " What ! " Mertyl cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you sure ? " " Strumm said so . He 's all upset . " Mertyl sank to the cot . " For Christ sake . Just when they get a man ready to fight they send him back to make snowballs . When do we go home ? " " I do n't know . I do n't care . " Vridar went over a hill and sat under a bank . For the soldiers in France he was glad peace had come ; but what would he do now ? He would be shoved back into the turmoilof living , back to his passion , back to Neloa and his child . If he had been killed she would have had ten thousand dollars and she could have lived through her grief and forgottenhim and married a man closer to her heart . And now he had to go back and take up his pitiable way of life : back to his violence and hatreds , back to his fight ... . And he wanted to go . His love for Neloa , he realized clearly , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left him weary and sick ; but it was the only way for him . In this hour he wanted to kneel to her as to an altar , and this in him , this awful abject devotion , he despised . In it there was neither beauty nor strength nor light . It was a world of darkness in which she was the terrible deity and he was the fool . . . . And this was his fight . It had been his fight for years and never for a single instant had he struck through to freedomand calm . In her quiet way , in her undeliberate childtoo WEARE BETRAYEDlike way , she had conquered him at every turn : in Annis , on the Antelope Hills , and in every bitter hour since : until she had become , not a woman but a force ; not a lover and wife but a power in the universe that was unalterably opposed to his will . Hers , he felt vaguely , was the wise and ancient plan , and his was the modern frenzy reaching to unattainable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now his years ahead would have been very unlike what they came to be . But he no more had the power to chasten himself to her quiet , to the simple and unquesting valleys of her life , than he had to sit happily with her among dull people in a dull house . And now he who had sought peace in a world of war had to turn back to warfare in a world of peace . . . . Three weeks later he was on the road home . He and Mertyl and forty others entrained at San Diego and on the way to Los Angeles the group developed a feud . Most of these men had wanted to go to France and had wanted to fight ; and now they turned upon one another . Those from San Francisco , led by an ex-pugilist , challenged those from Idaho and Montana to combat . " You cow-state bums ! " the leader cried . " Men is supposedto be tough where you come from ? Yeah , you cowmilkers ! Let 's see how tough you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the coach . The Idahoans and Montanans upon hearing the challenge rose from their seats . The pugilist spoke again , addressing himself to Vridar . " You ai n't no officer now , you long-nosed steer-roper ! You been lordun it over us grand and plenty but now we 're gon na dress that nose of yourn down . . . . Say when you 're ready to go ! " " Wait a minute ! " Vridar said . He turned to the men around him . The numbers in the two groups , he observed , were evenly divided . They looked about equal in size andWE ARE BETRAYED rotbrawn . On one side of him stood Mertyl and on the other was a powerful giant from Twin Falls . " What 's the rules for this fight ? " Vridar asked . " Rules ! They ai n't no rules ! When you guys is all smacked to the sawdust the fight 'll be over . " " Yeah ? " said the man from Twin Falls . " Yeah ! You ready ? " " Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't all fight at once ! " " We can , " said the pugilist . " And say , you steer-ropers , you gon na wait all night ? " " All right , " said the man from Twin Falls , " let 's go ! " At once Vridar was lost in a terrific brawl of curses and fists . The coach shook and glass was smashed from windows and the men fought and swore like pirates . Vridar had leapt to a seat ; and as the enemy came in a tide of fists and blasphemy he hurled himself on a man and clutched and went down . He had a man by his throat and with all his power he broke the man under him and shoved him to his knees and struck him in his mouth . He drove another blow into the man 's soft throat , and he went down , limp and unconscious ; and when Vridar came up , a hand smote him like a sledge of iron . It spun him round and he fell backward into the aisle and warriors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He protected his face and shook his head , trying to clear his wits ; and when the dizziness left him he crawled to one side between seats ; and after a moment he came up again , ready to strike . In this instant while he looked about him he saw Mertyl bring a man up over his head and break him across the hard arm of a seat ; saw Mertyl 's savage and bloody face ; saw the man from Twin Falls measuring blows ; saw a welter of men , sprawled or standing , and fighting like fiends . And then there came to Vridar that madness which used to strike him in Annis , in Poplar , when driven to the wall by school bullies ; and he babbled with fury that was dark and blind . He saw a man102 WE ARE BETRAYEDkick another , prone and helpless , in his face , and he got the man by his throat and choked him until his tongue fell out . He was lost to everything but murder now and he would have killed his enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid him out senseless . He rolled over on his belly and was still . . . . And when he came to the fight was done . In one end of the coach the Californians were ministering to their wounded ; and in the other end were his own comrades , some bearing no mark of the struggle , some bloody and undone . Mertyl had a cut lip . Dizzy and sick , Vridar allowed Mertyl to help him to a seat . " You hurt ? " " God no . You ? " " I do n't think so . I just feel  --  goofy . " He stretched his legs , his arms , to see if he had broken bones . On the back of his skull was a lump the size of a golf ball . " No , " he said , " I 'm all right . Anyone get hurt bad ? " " I do n't know . I guess not . " The man from Twin Falls was standing in the aisle , looking at the enemy . He had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here , let 's finish this ! " He spoke to the pugilist who was licking his bruised mouth . " Do n't , " Vridar said . " The war is over . " " I want a-lick that son-of-a-bitch ! " " Go to hell ! " said the pugilist . " When we get off of the train Hey , you ! In Los Angeles we 'll finish this ! " " I said go to hell ! " When they all left the train at Los Angeles , the man from Twin Falls like a hound to a scent was after his foe . But the pugilist ducked and vanished . " The dirty yellow dog ! " cried the young giant , returning to his comrades . His eyes were full of murder . " I want a-yank his heart out and stick my arm through it ! " WE ARE BETRAYED 103 " You done enough , " someone said . " You knocked two of his teeth out . " " I wanted a-knock his jawbones out . Callun me a cowmilker , the stinkun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the giant , and he looked around him . He shrugged . " Cows ! I never milked a cow in my life ! " Two hours later they entrained for their homes . Every man of them had prowled in underground places and had found whisky . Most of them had a pint or a quart but the man from Twin Falls had a gallon jug . Hour after hour he drank from his jug and cursed the pugilist . In a voice of utter disgust he would roar , " The son-of-a-bitch ! " and he would drink again . One of the men had a broken finger which he bandaged with a sock ; another had a tooth missing and other teeth which were loose and these he experimented with thoughtfully , trying to fix them solidly in place ; and a third had a big welt on his jaw . But none of them had been seriously hurt and most of them were singing like children now . They drank their whisky and roared from open windows into the night . Vridar and Mertyl sat together and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's all over now . " " Yes . France got licked and now Germany is licked . They 'll fight again . " " This is n't bad whisky , is it ? " " It 'll do . It 'll get a man drunk . " " Mert , you remember what nice boys we used to be ? We were models . Look at us now . " " We were fools , " Mertyl said . " What you suppose will become of us ? " " I do n't know . It does n't matter . Life 's a hell of a mess . " " What you intend to do when you get back ? " " Take to the road . " He turned to Vridar . " You had to104 WE ARE BETRAYEDbe a damn fool and go get married . We could a-gone to-gether . " " Yes , I know . I was a fool . " Vridar stared for a long moment into darkness . " Mert , " he said , " I wish I could go with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yes , I know it . . . . Where you going ? " " Anywhere . What 's the difference ? " " None . " In a little while Mertyl slept ; and Vridar , full of whisky and woe , studied his brother 's face . It was a large strong face but there was something weak , something loose and sensual , in the mouth . And there was , he remembered , somethingterribly bitter and stricken in the eyes . Our childhood years have him licked , too , he thought . They have licked both of us . The man from Twin Falls had dropped forward over his jug and was snoring into his lap . In a little while he awoke and looked about him and cursed . He saw Vridar watching him and he came over , bringing his jug . " You been to college , ai n't you ? " he asked . " Yes . " " Mebbe you'n tell me , then . Why did that son-of-abitchcall me a cow-milker ? " " He called us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did n't mean just you . " " He was lookun at me . . . . You married ? " " Yes . " " I was , " the man said , looking at Vridar with strange eyes . " But my wife  --  Your wife did n't get the Flu ? " " No . I do n't think so . " The man raised the jug to his lips but he did not drink . He set it down and left it in the aisle and went to a seat and bowed his head to his arms . In a few moments he was weeping like a child . XIIII T WAS late morning when the two brothers stepped down in Idaho Falls . Vridar looked at the train as it rolled out and went to the track and watched it disappear . Then they gathered their things and went to a small dark house . Prudence came running and was gathered in turn to their arms ; and then she stepped back , her eyes wide and bright , and Diana came forward to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was out in the yard , hanging clothes . Mertyl sat down , looking very cynical , and made a cigarette ; and Vridar left the house . He saw Neloa and he stopped for a moment and looked at her . She was very white and very thin . Among his memoriesof her this was to become one of the most vivid : a tall queenly girl , a very frail and lonely girl , hanging diapers to a line . He moved again and when she heard him she turned and looked at him in amazement . And then , " 0 sweetheart ! " she cried , and he never forgot how her voice rang in his name . She came swiftly to him and was in his arms and his face was lost in her hair . " Sweetheart ! " she said , her voice choked with wonder and grief . " Sweetheart yourself ! " he said and kissed her white mouth . She stepped back and looked at him . " Darling , is it you ? I ca n't believe it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She hugged against him , her hands locked behind his back as if she would never let him go . " I 've been so lonesome ! " she said ; and she cradled her face against him , her lips seekinghis throat . " Darling , I 've missed you so ! " Vridar 's eyes were wet now . He looked far away at the Antelope Hills and he strove to push his grief down but it was hot and overwhelming . " I love you ! " he said , trembling to her touch . " I love you , love you ! " io5xo6 WE ARE BETRAYED " And I love you . Darling , you glad to see me ? " " Glad ? You know I am . " She yielded now to one of her rare impulses : with palmsto his cheeks she drew his head down and kissed his wet eyes . " Now , " she said , trying to be gay , " you must come andsee baby . " She took his hand and led him to the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their child . " Is n't he sweet ? " " I guess . He looks about the same . " " Darling , he 's just too sweet for words ! " And now as formerly when around Vridar she became ill at ease . He saw her distress and drew her to him . " Sure , he 's all right , " he said . Ncloa was looking at him . " Darling , are n't you going to kiss him ? " " Kiss him ? Oh , sure . " Vridar bowed to his son and kissed a soft red cheek . He looked for a moment into the wondering blueness of the child 's eyes . Neloa took the babe in her arms . " Lincoln , this is daddy , " she said , her voice tremulous . " Son , this is daddy , back from the war ! " Vridar remembered never to have seen her so deeply moved . She was trembling and there was something almost hysterical in her movements , in her eyes . And he was filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arms and laid it on a pillow and drew her to him . " Neloa , " he said , " you 've changed . " " Uh-huh , " she said , smiling at him . There was something terrible in her smile . " Have n't they been good to you ? " " Yes . " " They have n't . I can tell . " " I do n't care , " she said . " You 're with me now . Vridar , you wo n't ever leave me again ? Ever , ever ? " " Not if I can help it , " he said . WE ARE BETRAYED 107An hour later he walked into the city . His father 's huge profits from wheat had been invested in a garage and Vridar went into the office and looked around him . Tires and tubes lay scattered about , wrenches and empty bottles , old cans and papers and odds and ends . He smiled , thinking of his father and his uncle as business men . As mechanics they were all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even wind an armature ; but they knew little of the fine and subtle hypocrisy of trade . . . . He went to the repair room . Joe was under a car , soaked to his hide with grease and gasoline ; and Ike , under another car , was profaning Henry Ford . " Hello under there ! " Vridar said , speaking to Joe . Joe paused in his mighty efforts and grunted . " Is that you ? " he asked . Vridar went over and peered at Ike . " What the hell you up to ? You trying to ruin that Ford ? " " The God-damn thing , " Ike said . " A Ford is a bunch a tin with four holes for spark plugs and a crank . . . . Vreed , hand me that-there crowbar . " Vridar got a crowbar sheathed with oil and pushed it to Ike . " I 'll move this nut , " Ike said , " or I 'll split this son-of-a-bitchun Ford wide open . " Vridar peered under the car and grinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a blacksmith . " Vreed , " Joe said , " if you got nothun to do you might set in the office . A feller might want some gas . " " Do you leave your office open like that ? " " Sure , " Ike said . " A office is just to set in anyhow . " " Do n't they steal things ? " " Let the sons-a-bitches steal . They hai n't enough to make anybody rich . " Vridar went to the office and in a little while Joe and Ike came . They looked as if they had been rolled in grease and sawdust . Their hair and beards were matted with oil and oil108 WE ARE BETRAYEDcould have been wrung from their clothes . A motorist drove up outside and honked and looked in . " He wants something , " Vridar said . " To hell with him , " said Ike . " Let him come in . He ai n't no bettern I am . " Vridar went out to serve the motorist but that gentleman with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're a heck of a business man , " Vridar said , returning to Ike . " You lose trade that way . " " We got plenty , " Ike said . " We 're busy . " " But you could make on gas and oil . " " To hell with it , " Ike said . " We ai n't damn lackeys . They even want us to pump up their God-damn tires . " " Well , you have to do it . That 's business . " Ike grunted and made a cigarette . " To hell with business , " he said . " We 're mechanics . " " Do n't you realize you 'll lose all your trade ? " Vridar said , speaking to Joe . " I guess we will , " Joe said . But he looked helpless . His manner said clearly that he did n't know what to do about it . " You need a manager , " Vridar said . " I 'm looking for a job . " " A manager ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . " " To build your trade up . I 'll tell you : let me manage andI 'll guarantee to double what you 're making now . If I don'tyou owe me nothing . If I do , pay me a hundred a month . " Ike and Joe looked at each other . " We 'll talk it over , " Ike said . And so Vridar became manager of this garage . The contractsfor gasoline and oil , the buying of accessories , the care of the office : these became his duties . It was he who , studiously tactful , pumped air into tires , filled radiators , and wiped dust from windshields ; who studied a competitor 's methods to learn wherein the man succeeded or failed ; who quieted the anger of customers when they felt they had beenWE ARE BETRAYED logovercharged ; and who added to the dignity of this place by having stationery printed , a new pump installed , and a great sign hung above the door . After a week he said they should have taxi service , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had been smashed in a wreck . Then he urged his family to live in the city so that Neloa or Prudence or another could step into the office while he made a call . He employed all his cunning and tact and within two months the firm 's business had doubled twice . But Vridar was not happy in this work . He was sickened by the smell of gasoline and oil . When he came home he weighed a hundred and seventy-four pounds but after three months in this garage he weighed a hundred and forty-two . He was sickened , too , by the sly dishonesty of methods which , in competition with others , he was forced to employ : the selling of cheap oil in trademarked containers , or pretending a. car needed repairing when it did not . He was wretched because Mertyl had packed his things , accepted a position as a traveling salesman , and disappeared . And besides all this , there lay ahead of Vridar now the post-war decade ; and the mood of it , the change , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the spoils ; soldiers , stripped of their ideals , were coming home and finding their jobs gone . Bootleggers were laying the groundwork of their vast industry and women were lifting their skirts and painting their cheeks and bobbing their hair . Henry Ford was crusading against the Jews and patriots were putting freedom into a coffin and spiking it down . The old ideals which had led nations into blood and fire were now ghastly silhouettes in the world 's mind ; and a new generation , cynical , desperate , pleasure-mad , had taken the stage . And Vridar , with his anchors gone , with his heart lost again to its old bitterness , cared little if red riots convulsed cities or if the Russian delirium engulfed the world . He strove to renounce all ambition and despise all doctrines and110 WE ARE BETRAYEDcreeds . Human nature had again shown itself to be the brutal and insatiably primitive thing that it was . This war had been undertaken much in the spirit of the Crusades , and had led , like them , only to murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand what had betrayed the world : his own race and himself . Those who had stayed home , greedy for profits , now followed like buzzards after the crippled , the shellshocked , and the blind who came back . And what was there that a man could love and cherish ? Nothing  --  at least nothingthat a betrayed humanity could point to . And what had led to the betrayal , what had made a Judas of all the Christian ideals ? This is the question that he would have given his life to answer . And when his mother asked one day if he was not going back to college , he stared at her for a long moment and left the room . Or when she rebuked his smoking and drinking and late hours he swung to her in violent scorn . " I 'd talk , Mater , damned if I would n't ! What did your generation do with all its cheap dogma ? What have you to show ? A mad world ! Mater , I should think your words would gag you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its hands tells me what to do ! God damn it , I 'm done with your generation and all that it stands for and I hate it clear to the bottom of my soul ! It has betrayed me and millions like me ! Your ideals have driven us to ruin and still you talk , talk , talk ! Millions are dead now , buried by these stinking ideals of yours ; and yet you sit there in your smug halfwitted Christian piety and tell me not to smoke , not to drink , go to school ! . . . Mater , do n't tell me any more what to do . I hate your way of life . I hate your little pompous religion and your little pompous gods . . .. " He left the room , shaking with fury and grief , and went down to the river and hid under its bank in thought . In God 's name all this ! All this monstrous betrayal in the name of one in Galilee . And now , as in time of childhood , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The whole vastWE ARE BETRAYED IIIuniverse around him was sweet and clean except where humanity touched it and wreaked its ideals into the shape of murder and set its ironic monuments to the dead . And even now , from end to end of living things , men and women were turning their decalogues and singing their hymns of peace  --  in this Sunday as in so many that were gone ; and yet , in this moment , when so many sang to God , there lay upon the awful waste of Europe the smell of death . Human legs and arms and human heads were scattered there in thousands ; and graveyards covered acres ; and it had all been done in the name of peace . It had all been a force , vast and primordial , deep and ancient as the sea ; and it had all taken humanityby its throat and filled cemeteries with its dreams ; left kingdoms rocking in its destroying power ; and put a new and terrible mightiness into the Russian heart . But why it had to be or what good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity built its ideologies into colossal self-betrayal .. . He left the bank and went to Neloa . She was sewing by a dark window and he knelt at her feet with his head and arms in her lap . She laid a hand on his hair . " I 'm sick , " he said . " Neloa , I 'm sick , sick .... " And so Vridar 's journey again turned downward ; and in the next eight months he passed through the most headstrong , most devastating , period of his life . He became a bootlegger ; he moved in this city 's underworld with the thieves and pimps and whores ; for he , like so many others , was a symbol of an old idealism , self-betrayed and dying , and of a new one fighting through cynicism to its birth . For days at a time he was never sober and he was never drunk . Late in each night he came to Neloa ; but he did not abuse her now or taunt her with the past ; he was done with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been or had wanted to be ; but emotionally he was still chained . Withz z z WE ARE BETRAYEDsavage earnestness he set himself to the task of rooting out of his being every ideal that he had . And he turned to the underworld to learn what they dreamed and what they did and whether their ideals betrayed them . He found the way to them easy and he went steadily ahead . XIVO FTEN in looking back he wondered how he escaped death ; for as a taxi-driver he was utterly reckless , now smashing into vehicles or bridges , now rounding a corner on two wheels . He drove a great Auburn that had no brakes and in one journey he struck a hog and hurled the beast through a fence and in another he swept like a war-tank over a herd of sheep . Once an enraged farmer pursued him with a gun . Twice he thought he had killed a man . .. . He was driving in a black night without moon or stars and without lights . Now and then he stopped and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn where he was on the road ; and suddenly , without warning , there was a crash . He heard a horse galloping furiously down the road . And while he sat there , wondering if he had killed the other horse of a team , a match flared ahead of him and in its patch of yellow he saw the face of a man . The match went out and the man yelled . " I 'm killed ! " he roared . " Someone has killed me ! " Vridar left the car and found the man sitting in a buggy , fumbling like an intense darkness in a larger darkness . There came an agonized wail . " I 'm bleedun to death ! You 've killed me ! " " You sound , " Vridar said , " much alive to me . " He struck a match and saw a husky young swain with blood running down his nose . The man had blood on his hands and he was staring at it , speechless with terror . Vridar drove the man into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the doctor , after a brief examination , dismissedthem impatiently , declaring the man was not hurt at all . Vridar then bought salves for the man and took him to a hotel and paid for his room ; and a week later the man113aI14 WE ARE BETRAYEDentered the garage . He scowled at Vridar ' for a long moment before he spoke . " You owe me damages , " he said . " You pay or I 'll sue you. , , " Sue me for what ? " " Damages . I been to a lawyer .

But he says mebbe if " " Ten thousand ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court , why it would n't be that much . He saidVridar sat on a chair and roared with laughter . This young man 's comically serious face convulsed him and he threshed the air and howled . " Beat it ! " he gasped . " You 're killing me ! " He rose and bent over a counter , agonizing with joy . " And now , " he said , spasmodic bursts shaking him , " now I 'm going to sue you  --  for shock ! I 'll sue you  --  for a million dollars ! " " A million dollars ! " said the astonished young man . " Yes . For being on the wrong side of the road . And for shock . " Vridar got his hat . " I 'm going to see a lawyer now , " he said . But it was not these accidents to which he gave his thought . It was to the meaning of this new frenzy upon earth : this cynicism , this lawlessness of young people , this contempt for the old . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its heart . On Friday afternoons he went to a small outlying hamlet and fetched a group of teachers to their homes . They were women in their twenties : amorous , starved , and twittering . Three of them sat in the front seat with him and wanted toWE ARE BETRAYED r z slearn to drive and at last he yielded the wheel to a girl named Bertha Monson . She was an earnest brisk person who seemed to know what she was doing ; and she drove all right until she rounded a corner and saw before her an enormous truck . Thrust out from the truck was a wooden beam , and Bertha , missing the brake , stepped on the gas and shot ahead . Like a mighty arm the beam swept windshield and glass and top from the car and the car shot off the road and crashed into a fence . Vridar stood up and shook the glass from him and sprang out . He looked at the stricken faces of the girls . Then he lay against a bank and looked into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the car and laughed with him . They all sat in a row against the bank and laughed until tears washed their cheeks . " It was fun ! " one cried . " I liked it ! " " It 's the only exciting thing ever happened to me . " " Or me . " " It 's bettern teaching school . " " Lord , anything 's bettern teaching school . " And Vridar , staring at them , was amazed . They were strangely radiant and excited , as if , for the first time in their dull years , they had touched life . They now went down the road like a group of children out of school , delivered to a fresh and vital enthusiasm . They burst into song or tiptoed to the sky . . . . Hail ! Hail ! The gang 's all here ! What the hell do we care ? Oh , what the hell do we care . . . . Vridar looked after them in wonder . They linked hands , the eight of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , mademoiselle from ArmentieresHas n't been kissed in a hundred years , Hinky-dinky par-ley voo ! z16 WE ARE BETRAYEDHere , it seemed to Vridar , was the new meaning upon earth but he could not understand it in dance and song . Here was this new and cynical wonder in the hearts and minds of the young . In it he felt an intimation of the way he hungered for ; of that candid arm-in-arm fellowship with life . He saw it now and knew its meaning but in an hour it was gone . And with only the lawless and the empty around him , he became , early in March , a bootlegger . Ike , after a week of reflection , became his partner , but the uncle drank more than he sold . Together they had a jug in a secret place and they drank from the jug . Vridar 's hunger for whisky grew on him and he fought against it ; but he moved in nebulous ecstasy , with all life summarized as a liandful of chaff . Often he and Ike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quart of whisky ; and they drove madly through the country , singing folk-ballads , or they sat on hilltops and waited for the dawn . Vridar had a genuine admiration for Ike . He liked bold men and their hard-fisted assaults on life : the McGard clan , his own relatives , savage and hellbound . Ike was a handsome giant who had contempt for order and routine and the fixed purpose . His spirit was that of the pirate , the buccaneer ; and life , until a year ago , had chained him to a farm of drouth and weeds . When he repaired a car he took with him as often as not an iron maul instead of wrenches and flashlight . But he was a magnificent blacksmith and he could draw beauty out of blows of steel upon steel . One evening Ike sat in a Packard and fingered what he called its God-damned do-dads . He wanted to drive it and Vridar protested and Ike said he would just go outside and return . Across the street was a cafe . Ike started the Packard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then something went wrong . Ike said afterward the clutch stuck ; Vridar thought it more probable that Ike lost his head . AnyWEARE BETRAYED 1 17way , with a sudden burst of speed , Ike shot across the street , bolted over the curb and sidewalk , struck one hundred square feet of glass window , and plowed into the cafe among tables and diners and went clear to the kitchen . There was a great uproar . The police department , the fire department , rushed to the scene ; diners fled as if pursued by German wartanks ; and the owner of the cafe danced up and down and cursed . And when Vridar came to his uncle , that imperturbablefellow was sitting quietly in the front seat , fingeringthe gadgets on the switchboard . " Tell them to clear the decks , " he said . " I 'm gon na back out now . " Ike was arrested and marched to jail but he returned in a little while , grinning like a schoolboy . He cocked his feet up and smoked . " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what all them damn do-dads is for . I never learnt about them in school . " And this , then , was Vridar 's partner in bootlegging : this man who cared no more about policemen and jails than he cared for the grease in his beard . They prospered in their trade ; for nearly everyone , it seemed to Vridar , was drinking whisky now . Girls bought the stuff ; and ranchers , flushed with war-profits ; and the young men of the town . On a Saturday evening they would come to him and he would enter the basement and dig a bottle out of a cinder pile . He would take it into an alley and set it in darkness by a wall . And by all of this  --  the prevalence of drinking and by the kind of persons who drank  --  Vridar was amazed . He had thought only the wastrels , only the sotted and bedeviled part of humankind , debauched themselves with strong drink . He learned , on the other hand , that it was often the good folk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greedily and seemed most bent on finding hell . The harlots drank very little and some of them did not drink at all . The other taxidriverswere , for the most part , sober and earnest. x18 WE ARE BETRAYEDThere was Roy Shell , a cab-driver and a bootlegger . He never profaned and he never drank and there was about him a strange professional dignity and a pitying smile . In all his dealings he was a man of unimpeachable integrity . His home life was charming and quiet ; and when the day 's work was done he took his children to his knee and told them legends or romped with them on the floor ; and on Sunday he went with them to church and sang with them and prayed . Everyonetrusted this man and everyone liked him . . . . Or there was Bill Rummon , the pimp , with whom Vridar often talked . An orphan since birth , Bill had been jerked up by the hair of his head and turned loose into the world at the age of ten . And he , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor shame in what he did . " I do n't understand , " Vridar would say to Neloa . " I always thought there were good people and bad people . In books they 're that way . In books it 's villains and heroes .... Now look at me . I was a good boy . And now I swill the stuff . Rummon was a bad boy and he stalks around as sober as an owl . . . . What does it all mean ? " Or to Prudence he would say : " The world is n't what you said it is . Do you know a man who preached last Sunday was stretched out last night as flat as a map ? " " I do n't believe it , " she said . " Oh , do n't you ? Look at the Billings Packard . He hung over it all night and puked it full . " " Son , I 'd be ashamed ! " " I mean James Thurstow .

You mean , of course , what a beautiful casket . And when you leave , he yanks the dead guy out and nails him up in a wooden box .

" " You 've forgot all your training , " Prudence said . " I trained you right . " For a long moment Vridar stared at her . " Forgotten my training ? Mater , that 's exactly what I 'm trying to forget . " IxvIDAHO FALLS was a thriving city of twelve thousand , with wide clean streets , with Snake River rolling under its west end . Far to the west were white or blue mountains and to the east was the blue backdrop of Vridar 's home . It fed on a rich valley , famous for its potatoes and sugar beets . In the groves and corridors to the north or east lived the aristocracy ; just beyond the railroad tracks lived the middle class ; and to the south , flanked by warehouses , were the tenementsand dark retreats . Out in an acreage of sand with weeds overtopping it and with gophers heaping their mounds was the golf course ; and here on Sunday afternoons the industrialand professional baronage came and waded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redroot . Those who afforded less prestige went cast or south to fish and the earthborn sat on the river bank or the bridge . And it amazed Vridar to discover that this city had a small embryonic underworld . It seemed to be on the surface only a proud and unschooled place , set out and marked off on a plateau of routine : with doors made to open , sidewalks to tread , gutters to spit in . The countryside on weekends poured into it a flood of gingham and overalls ; and after the city was searched for bargains and markets the country went home . On holidays there was noise and scattered bottles , dust and swarming children and exhaustion . There were hotels , drugstores , poolhalls , garages , shops . . . . " And what else ? " Vridar asked of Neloa . " You 'd be surprised . Bootleggers , pimps , harlots , and small shysters of a dozen kinds . You know , I 've been a most unaccountable fool . I never dreamed that human nature is what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was worse than humankind . I 've been an awful simpleton . I 2ffWE ARE BETRAYED 12 1 " Well , I do n't know what the hell life means but I 'm trying to find out . Do you care ? " " Not if it 's what you want to do . " " It 's what I have to do . There 's no other way . " He was finding out and to this unlessoned young man with his heritage of absurd ideals there was offered one amazementafter another . Save in one experience , memory of which still galled him , he had never talked with a harlot , though he had been accosted by them and had seen their hard painted faces and terrible eyes . He had thought much about them , wondering why they sold their love ; and how many men , at one time or another , slept with them ; and why . He was eager to study them and discover their meaning . In his taxi he met the trains . One midnight a woman came down the steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Vridar and he drove her to an ugly old building and the woman looked at him again . " I do n't have no money with me , " she said . " Come up to my room . " Vridar followed her up a dark broken stairway and she entered a room and turned on a light . He waited by the door . " Come in , " she said . He entered the room . He thought this woman was a housewife back from a journey and he waited patiently for his fare . But the woman ignored him and took off her shoes . At last : " Set down , " she said . Vridar went to a chair and sat . And now the woman took off her stockings and Vridar wished he was out of here . If she would pay him , he said  --  and she looked at him , her eyes flickering with amused pity . Her red mouth smiled . " I do n't have no money , " she said ; and by her tone he realized that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . " Well , then I guess you ca n't pay me . " " Set down ! " she cried . She was not smiling now . Her black eyes were hard and opaque . Undecided , a little angry , and feeling like a country lad at a fair , Vridar looked at her and twirled his hat . " But if you have n't any money " " Money is n't the only thing , kid . " She glanced at her legs , now bare to the knees ; and Vridar looked at them , too , and they were , he reflected , very good to look at . The woman was now taking off her other clothes . " I have to go , " said Vridar . " I have other calls to make . " " But honey , I have n't paid you yet . " Vridar stared at her , sick with disgust . " You mean ? " She rose and came to him , soft-footed and sinuous ; she tried to put arms to his neck . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling up at him . " You 're so young and nice . You ever kissed a woman yet ? " " To hell with kissing ! " " Listen , kid , do n't push me away . I like you . . . . Listen , boy , do n't you want me ? " " Of course I do n't ! " She stared at him , genuinely surprised . " You 're a liar . Look me over , boy . Ai n't I all right ? Here , look at this leg . " She drew her skirt up and exposed a lovely thigh . " Feel my breasts . They ai n't soft yet , kid . I ai n't nobody 's fool . " She took Vridar 's hand and he allowed her to lay his hand on her breast . " Squeeze , " she said . " No . I 'm going . " " Listen , kid , what the hell 's the matter ? Ai n't I all right ? " " Sure , you 're all right . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off and you'n Iook me over . I ai n't none a your fat molls . I got a body , kid , not a pile a suet . " She began to strip her clothes off . Vridar moved to the door but she sprang ahead of him and turned the key . SheWE ARE BETRAYED 123hurled the key and it clattered in a dark corner and was lost . And while Vridar looked at her , wondering how far it was from the window to the street , she took her clothes off and stood naked before him . " Look at me , kid . Do I suit you or do n't I ? " " Please let me out , " Vridar said . He started for the corner , bent on finding the key , but the woman faced him at every turn , dimpling , smiling ; and at last he roared : " God damn it , let me out of here ! " " Honey , what is there ai n't perfect about me ? You 're just afraid , kid . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined to make him yield , Vridar shouted at her in fear and rage . His words , unwisely chosen , ringing with denunciation and contempt , brought a crisis . She sprang at him as if stung ; and then , like a white flash of fury , she hurled things at him : clothes , cigarette trays , magazines . The air was full of them and Vridar dodged , lost now in amazement ; he ran to the door . With all his might he tore the door open and flung it back and leapt to the stairway ; and behind him in furious assault came odds and ends , curses and shrieks . When he reached his car a naked woman leaned from a window and poured at him such hysterical blasphemy as he had never before heard . Driving to a dark street he stopped and sat here for hours in thought . And after he told Neloa of the experience : " I ca n't figure out what it means . You 're a woman : can you ? " Neloa looked at him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . But this was in April and he knew little of harlots then . Six months later he knew about them , he imagined , all that was to be known . Though never their lover he talked with them and studied their ways , determined to understand their point of view . He discovered , of course , that most of them10z 24 WE ARE BETRAYEDwere very vain , very stupid , and unspeakably foul . But he liked them , nevertheless . They did not , like most persons , pretend to be more than they were . Love was not for them , as it was for him , as it was for most of the people he knew , a quaint cowardice of wooing , of twittering guilt when the lights were out . They did not lay their bodies in darkness as if love were a thief , sneaking up through a wilderness of precepts . No : everything about them was as bold and frank as sunlight . " And did you know , " he said to Neloa , " that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep with a prostitute ? Even farmers . Now there 's John Curtin : a swell husband and father , goes to church , sings hymns , prays , nice to his wife ; but he comes hell-bending down here to stretch out with a prostitute . And the queer thing about it is that John Curtin is a pretty fine man as men go . " It 's a funny world , is n't it ? " " It sure is , " Neloa said . " But why does he ? " " Do n't ask me . That 's just what I 'm trying to figure out . " By July he knew nearly all the harlots of the city ; and because he drove a cab , men came to him  --  out-of-town men looking sheepish , acting like truant lads  --  to ask where they " could find a woman . " With a cynical smile Vridar would ask what kind . " Oh , " one would say , " just any , so 's she ai n't too skinny ; " and another would say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all I got . " In this month there came to him two of his comrades from Battery D. They asked for whisky and Vridar gave them a pint and sold them a quart ; and then , swaggering a little , they asked for women . Vridar went with them to a shabby building , dark and smelling of age . They climbed a dark stairway and were met by a harlot . Three harlots lived in this place . One was a big surlyWE ARE BETRAYED 115creature with a birthmark across her mouth ; another was tall and thin and never smiled ; but the third was a very lovely woman . It was the third who met them now , coquetting in a flesh-colored gown of silk , with hair falling in a lustrous jungle over her breast . While she toyed with the men , Vridar looked into the room to see what was there . The big harlot had a knout in one hand . A man , drunk  --  grinning like a schoolboy , was lying on the floor and the big harlot was flogging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off great guffaws of joy . Vridar stood speechless : with wonder because never before had he seen a flogging in one of these dens . He stared as the man rolled in voluptuous agony and begged for harder blows . This was a riddle indeed . And wishing to be alone to think of the matter he left his companions and went to the garage basement and sat for a long while in thought . He revised from week to week his opinion of human nature , observing how the same impulses , the same hungers , were in all men . And yet , it seemed to him , not every prostitutehad the manner of an ingenue and the heart of a snake . Now and then he saw one who had womanly warmth and a generous heart and a sense of humor . . . . There was Lily McCoy , a Scotch-Irish lass , petite and lovely and alluring , who traveled up and down this line . She went as far south as Ogden , as far north as Butte ; and stopped in Idaho Falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , as most harlots did , and throw her door open to every diseased or sotted wretch who appeared with three dollars in his hand . Her clientele  --  she called it that  --  was , she declared to Vridar , only the very best of people : business and professional men , bankers and lawyers and merchants . " And I treat them decent , " she said . " I do n't rush them . They take their time . . .. " Vridar liked Lily and she liked him . She was not lewd of126 WE ARE BETRAYEDtongue and gesture . There was about her , in fact , a quiet dignity , a simple earnestness , beyond the girlish vivacity of her charm . Her profession for her was no less worthy than that of housewife or social worker ; for she gave pleasure to men and the pleasure was clean . Vridar always met her at the train , knowing when she would come . When he first saw her she asked him into her room ; and then , quietly , with dignity , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In money , he said ; and she never asked that question again . But always he went into her room and sat for a while and talked ; and he thought it very strange that he should like this girl , that he should respect her even , for she was only a harlot after all . He liked her , of course , because there was no shame in her , no guilt , no pious pretense and whimwham . In so many ways she was what he was not and despaired of ever being . And while he looked at her lovely face , her small and exquisite body , it was hard to believe that so many men embraced her , so many lips sought her own . He listened gratefully and made slow revisionof his opinions as she talked . One evening she talked of her patrons . She did not give names , because a whore , she said , " can be as moral as anyone else . I have my sense of honor , of what is right . " She talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the world : a happier place . And Vridar was impelled to ask a question that had been in his mind for weeks . " Lily , tell me : why do married men go to  --  to harlots ? 1'n understand it in single men but not in the married ones . " She laughed and her laugh was low and musical . " Married men are unhappy , Vridar . That 's why . Do n't you know that nearly all good women are indecent ? They 're God-awful . And when their husbands come to me they yank their clothes off and take me in their arms and do n't feel shame . " Vridar , do you love your wife without any shame at all ? " WE ARE BETRAYED I27 " Me ? " he said blankly . " Well , I do n't know . Maybe not. , , " Men idealize their wives , " Lily said . " They think it 's sort of terrible , you know , to love them . But I  --  I 'm just a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . God made wives to have babies . He made us " And she laughed merrily and reached for a cigarette . One evening when Lily came to the city she told Vridar she wanted to talk to him and he entered her room and she closed the door . She locked the door and he hardly knew what to make of that . Then she sat on the bed and told Vridar to sit by her , and he went , feeling bewildered ; and she laid a hand on one of his hands . " Vridar , I like you an awful lot and I been thinking . " " About what ? " he said , looking at her . " But first I want to tell you about me . I 'm twenty . I was married at sixteen when I was a freshman in college . I married a big football egg and I could n't get along with him . He was a tub . He wanted a lot of mistresses . And he could n't love me without getting red all over and thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a baby back home , a boy of three . " She turned to Vridar and he looked at the frank darkness of her eyes . " How much , " she asked , " do you make at your job ? " " A hundred a month . " " That 's nothing . That 's slavery . . . . Vridar , come with me . " " With you ! What do you mean ? " " Travel with me . I 'll tell you . Do n't think I 'm going this way all my life . Some day I 'm going to marry and settle down and have a home . " " But why should I go with you ? " " To help me . In four years I'n make enough to keep us . Then " " You mean , " he asked , horrified , " that I 'm to be your  --  your  --  " She clapped a hand to his mouth. 1 28 WE ARE BETRAYED " Do n't say it . " " But that 's what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . In a few yearswe could travel in Europe . " He stared at her , incredulous . " But I 'm married , " he said , not knowing what else to say . " I know . But you do n't love your wife . " " I do . " " Honest ? Then why are you so unhappy ? " " I 'm not . " " Do n't make me laugh . You 're the unhappiest man I ever saw . " She studied his face . " Well , I wish you did n't love your wife . We could have a swell time . " He stood up , feeling choked . " But I ca n't . I love my wife . I love her more than everything else . " He gestured helplessly . " No , Lily , I could n't do that . " She rose and faced him . " Some day , " she said , " you might change your mind . " She wrote an address on a card . Vridar took the card and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had swung to him in furious contempt he would have felt all right ; but there was no spite in this girl . There was something very lonely and homeless and he felt a great pity as he looked at her . " I 'm  --  I 'm awful sorry , " he said ; and he turned the key and let himself out . He told Neloa of what had been said and she looked at him , her smile faint and inscrutable . " And it 's funny , " he said , " but I like her . She has taught me a lot . You know she says a lot of men have never seen their wives naked . What has happened to the human race anyhow ? And she told me why men go to harlots and I begin to see that she is right . Neloa , you know the biggest thing I am learning ? " " What ? " she asked , still smiling . " That there 's really no such thing as good people and badWE ARE BETRAYED 129people . Lily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess we 're all much alike . Our vices and virtues are assorted differently and we show different colors but that is about all . " And that , " he said earnestly , " is a hell of a lot to have learned . " XVIT HE garage office became the lounging-place of a dozen men , and Vridar studied them day after day , trying to understand them and wondering if they were an average of humankind . Larry McInnes was a cunning rascal whose smile hid from all but the most discerning the plotting and trickery of his soul . Tall and lean , he wore roomy trousers that hung from his shoulders like a sack ; and he moved about alertly , profaning and chewing tobacco and telling his lewd tales . Everyone liked him , even those whom he duped ; because in this nervous scoundrel there was a generous heart and a boyish fellowship with his kind . He gave money as if his huge pockets were full of it . He even bought a home and furnished it for his favorite whore . Rollie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpitying rogue Vridar was never to sec . His mind was a reservoir of plots for preying on his fellowmen ; but he was a gentleman and dressed like one : his hands and clothes were immaculate , his voice was soft and wellbred . Though he had about him the stealthy look of a coyote , searching for a hencoop , he was held , nevertheless , in respect and he delivered many a funeral sermon in the countryside . After the sermon was done he would sell to the grieving relatives something that was worthless , something they had no use for . . . . And there was Shorty Duff , the hunchbacked dwarf . Shorty was an armful of deformity with an ancient and sardonic face . He was only twenty-four but his face was the face of an old man and his smile was the most twisted leer Vridar had ever seen . With no neck , with his shoulders bunched up to his ears , he would come into the office , a cigarette hanging from his white mouth , a fixed and cynical spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair , with the hump on his back pushing him forward , and laugh in a queer130WE ARE BETRAYED 131strangled way at Larry 's jokes . And Vridar loved this strange grotesque out of the dark ways of life . " What is there for him ? " he would ask Neloa . " Nothing at all . He is something that persons grin at and draw away from . And when I see how some look at him in their pitying way I could flog their hearts out .... " But Vridar did not love Shorty 's brother . Ronald Duff had everything that Shorty did not have : a strong body , a handsome face , a winning smile ; and this man , like Forenoon McClintock , made seduction his chief enterprise . " I 'm a passionate bugger , " he said one day ; and apparently he was , because he ran with harlots , too . Vridar 's most vivid memory of Ronald came to be of a young man out in the lavatory , yelping with pain . " A lemon 's supposed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it just do n't work for me .... " And there was George Pitman , a free-lance mechanic : a small man with long arms and a long thin nose . His marriage , like Vridar 's , had grown from a childhood romance and now he hated his dowdy little wife with her huge torso . Mrs. Pitman 's fullness became , indeed , a legend here and many were the jests about it . For months George thought he had a child coming ; but a doctor , after examining Mrs. Pitman , said she had an ovarian cyst . " He says I 'm to blame , " declared George , and his smile was both sheepish and proud . His grin was proud because this man 's boast was what he could do with ten half-dollars . Often he took men into the rear of the garage and laid wagers and won ; and there Vridar watched , not the boyish pride of this man but the envy of those who looked on . Their eyes were bright with wonder and in their malicious jests they revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discover how many of them were ashamed of their own organs . Much that he had heard in childhood now became clear to him : legends of Jack Barg of Annis who had to wear a rubber collar ; of James Wharton who , in disgust , caponized himself ; and of folktales regarding the size of a man 's nose and its sexual13 2 WE ARE BETRAYEDsignificance . George Pitman 's nose was half the length of his face . " A lot I used to wonder about , " Vridar said to Neloa , " is clear now . Certainties everywhere leap at a man who has eyes to see . Take these silly sociologists and the reasons they give for divorce . I know three reasons that have never got into a textbook . . . . And one of them , " he said , " is a damned short reason . . . . " And there was Bill Rummon , the lean and lecherous pimp . His pale green eyes were as fixed and changeless in expression as the eyes of a hawk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of passionless amusement worn thin . But his mouth was full and alive , with a sensual fruity ripeness ; and when the man talked he often paused to suck his lower lip in , drawing it in and nursing it as if it were a treat . After studying the eyes , Vridar was astonished by the mouth ; and after studying the mouth he was astonished by the eyes : they seemed to have been taken from different faces . Rummon had a woman in the rooms above the garage : a huge and terrible person who cursed and drank whisky and fed on narcotics . Sometimes she would thrust her head from the window and shout at Rummon and he would leap up as if kicked . Vridar despised this man but he talked with him often , determined to understand what made him . " It 's my pro-. fession , " Bill would say with comical dignity . " If ladies he always spoke of harlots as ladies sell their love they have to have gentlemen to help them . I take a commission just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it .. . . " Bill had in mind a wild lovely madcap who was the talk of the countryside . Her name was Madge Eppert . Vridar hardly knew what to make of Madge or of others , much like her in reckless spirit , of whom he saw a great deal . He thought much of them and of the crazy dark patterns of love and lust . Now and then he wanted to woo them but he was Neloa 's slave . If he had been bound and trussed ; if he had been roped to her bed , with his arms and legs inWE ARE BETRAYED 133stocks , he could not have been more hopelessly in her power . He hungered for a great clean freedom but he was a man in jail , pouring whisky upon his curse ; harboring plots for his own destruction ; fetching up night after night at the same dead end . Only once during all his months here did he try to break free . He drove with Bill and Madge and another girl into the country . Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Vridar watched them leave the road and crawl through a fence and disappear behind a grove of trees . Then he turned to Maxine Allen , a sour girl with red hair , and put his arms around her ; but she was like a woman of lead . When he touched her breast , though , she swung to him in fury and slapped his face and for a little while he was too astonished to move . " What the hell 's the matter with you ? " he asked . " You leave me alone ! Do n't you dare touch me ! " " What are you out here for ? " " Do n't you touch me ! " He grasped her arms and shook her . " You idiot ! " he cried furiously . The girl moved to escape but he broke her across his lap and she was strangely quiet as he held her face to moonlight . It was a face almost distorted with passion . " Do n't , " she said . " I 'm not that kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't like you . I would n't do anything with you . " Her quiet scorn infuriated him . He shook her again and she wailed . With violent hands he shuttled her back and forth and from side to side and she did not resist now . She was limp and helpless and he knew that she liked to be manhandled ; but he did not understand . And when , overcome again by amazement , he stopped to meditate , she swung and struck his face . She kicked wildly at his legs and yanked his hair . " What 's the matter with you ? " he asked 134 WE ARE BETRAYEDHe crushed her to the bottom of the car and then dragged her up , his hands like steel on her naked arms ; and again she was limp against him and her mouth kissed his throat . But the moment he paused in his violence , in his experimental attempt to rend her flesh and break her limbs , she was at him again , her hands like wild things in his face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left him speechlessand he crawled out of the car and stared at the girl . Her mouth was strangely savage , and so were her eyes ; and what sort of person she was he could not imagine . He left her sitting here and walked back to town . And the more he learned during these months the more he was lost in bewilderment . The riddle of life was darker . Moving , week after week , among the outcasts , studying them , eager to know what lay in their hearts , he saw them as animals , feeding their appetites and exploiting one another . And this city , he reflected , was like other cities ; and these people , the respectable and the outcasts , were like people everywhere . They were lost in an undecipherable grammar of struggle and greed . There was no grandeur here , no idealism like acid upon the dross ; no chastity that was not cowardice , no pride that was not arrogant and mean . And between the two groups  --  the respectable who stood in sunlight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little difference . He had seen harlots give to beggars ; he had seen Bill Rummon , moist of eye , quavering of tongue , rebuke a lout who had taunted Shorty Duff . He had seen lawyers perjure themselves and their clients and he had seen a churchman steal and he had seen a bootlegger help an old woman across the street . And he himself had felt at times a dark murderous lusting or hatred of the male for the male ; or wonder , childlike and suffering , for the lewd and unclean meanings in the meaningless ; or a wish , deep and dark in its sickness , to give his life to make the world good . In books human beings were not as he found them now . In books right was right and wrong wasWE ARE BETRAYED 13 Swrong ; the hero was a splendid fellow with his thoughts always in the upper half of his torso ; and the villain was a monstrous wickedness who came to a bad end . . . . And he was sick of his life here but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to pastures where growth was clean . This needed a power beyond his own will . In a night of August and in a terrible day that followed , that power came . XVIIBILL RUMMON came to him at midnight . He wanted to go to Pocatello , he said ; and when Vridar went to his taxi , he saw that Madge Eppert was already there . " You going , too ? " he asked . " Sure I 'm going , " she said . Vridar roared out upon the highway and this midnight ride in a blinding downpour was the most reckless of all his journeys in a car . He could barely see through the glass ; the road was a faintly luminous streak of light ; but he pushed the gas-lever clear to the floor and the car under him was a mad thing roaring through the storm . In a little while he saw the wan lights of Blackfoot like matches in a fog ; and then , in a moment of terror , he saw that the highway swung in a right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop and his speed was too great for the turn . He went straight ahead with terrific power and there was a sound of flying stone and of sand in a whirlwind . . . . He and Rummon got out in downpour . The car had driven into a great pile of sand and gravel and had buried itself to the steel frame and every wheel was spinning . . . . And after they had spent two hours digging out of this mound , Vridar lost the highway and plowed through the mud of a country lane ; came to a halt on a high bank , with the car rocking under him ; got out to explore and fell headlong into darkness . He fell into a great pit , knee-deep with water and mud . Against the black sky above he could see the car , swaying gently . For what seemed to him an hour he strove to get out of this hole ; and when at last he came to the car , furious at Rummon for not coming to his aid , he learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was daybreak when he reached Pocatello . After peering into cafes or entering lobbies and staring at hotel registers , 136WE ARE BETRAYED 137he went to a taxi office and inquired there . Yes , said a driver , he had fetched a man and a woman in two hours ago and they had taken the eastbound train . Vridar rushed to the station . " A man and a girl bought tickets a while ago . Will you tell me what city they bought tickets to ? " " Chicago . " " Chicago ? Thanks . " Vridar came out and looked south at the wet rails , thinkingof Madge Eppert , speeding to Chicago and whoredom . He thought of pursuing or telegraphing the Chicago police or going to Rummon 's shrew and telling her what had been done ; but he turned wearily to his car and drove home . His life , years ago , had been meaningless delirium of terror and lust and now it was a senseless nightmare of whisky and harlots and pimps . What had Swift meant , what had Arnold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? There was Mertyl . . . . He had come home a week ago ; and one day , looking at him , Vridar had asked : " Where 'd you get that long scar on your cheek ? " " That ? Oh , a sixshooter . It was like fiction . " " What are you now , Mert ? Just a woman-chaser ? " " That 's enough . I listened to your lectures for nineteenyears . " And now , while driving home , Vridar was remembering how Mertyl sold photographs . " There 's nothing to it . First , you see a kid in the yard . You go to the mother and say , Are you the mother of this boy ? Well , I just happened to be passing . You see , I 'm in the professional photography business . He would photograph remarkably well . Enlarge well , too . You do n't happen to have a photograph of him ? . . . " Yes , indeed , he would make up astonishingly well . There  --  that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a splendid enlargement : the light here , see ? and the shadows there . . . " ' And Vridar had said : " The photographs cost you two dollars and you charge13 8 WE ARE BETRAYEDten . And the whole rotten business is an appeal to a mother 's silly vanity . " " Listen , Vreed , how much does the oil cost you sell for thirty cents a quart ? " " Fourteen by contract . " " All right , clean your own damned house first . " " Mert , are n't you going to school again ? " " Do n't imagine . Are you ? " " I 've been wondering . " And to Neloa he had said : " I 'm not worth shooting and that 's the truth of it . I 'm a fool . " " Listen , Vridar , are we going on living like this forever ? " " No , not forever . I 'll be dead after a while . " " Do n't be so silly ! " And today he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just a sot , " he reflected . " I used to have ideals , dreams . I wanted to be a great teacher , a great writer ; and here I am , a fool with his jug . " For two hours he sat here and drank , telling over and over his pitiable absurdities , addingloss to loss . He wished some power would shake him out of this paralyzing apathy , this emotional rot ; something to wreak upon him a new courage ; a meeting of sunlight and dark . But he saw none and he could think of none . Tomorrowhe would drink again , as thousands did ; and the next week , the next month : through the seasons , year after year , and what could save a man from that . What could save a man from himself ? Nothing had saved Thompson  --  Villon  --  Swift  --  Collins  --  Verlaine  --  Marlowe  --  Poe  --  Bierce  --  Leopardi  --  Coleridge  --  Nietzsche  --  and thousands . Nothing was savingthousands today . In one way and another they burned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink : and among them the great in both mind and heart : these spirits homeless in an armful of flesh . They were spurts of fire in a wildernessof dark ; matches flaring in cupped hands in a wind : that was all , and he would be less , infinitely ; and it did not matter . Humanity was candles set upon the wasteland : mostWE ARE BETRAYED 139of them trimmed wicks with a round immaculate poise ; and some that caught a strange brightness and burned and went out ; and some that never burned at all . . . . He went up the stairs , wishing some power would deliver him to an incandescent vision , to a catharsis of fire . He left the garage and crossed the street and climbed to Neloa 's room , and out of dark blunder and rage he built the crisis . ' When he entered the room his son was squawling hideously . Vridar stood by the door and scowled . " What the hell 's the matter with him ? " " I do n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went over and looked at his son . " What 's wrong with you ! " he shouted . " Shut it up ! " He stared at the furious red face and the wide bawling mouth . He picked the child up . " Stop it ! You damned little tyrant ! " He turned to Neloa . " Now what in God 's name is wrong with him ? Do n't you know ? " " Of course I do n't . He just howls . " Vridar shook his son . " Shut up , you idiot ! " But the babe redoubled in agony and volume . It was sixteen pounds of red flesh and wrath and open mouth . Vridar shook it again and roared . " Shut up , damn you , or I 'll shake your head off ! I wo n't have such a fool son ! . . . It 's temper , " he said to Neloa . " Where the hell did he get all that temper ? " " Where ! " she said . " I 'd ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood it , bawling in ear-splitting fury , on its head ; threw it on a quilt and rolled it over and over ; and shook it again . " Shut up , damn it ! You monster of bad heritage ! " He shook it and the child 's head pitched back and forth ; and then , suddenly , the child was still . Into its face , red with fury a moment ago , came the whiteness of death ; and it closed its eyes like a mechanical doll and was limp. 140 WE ARE BETRAYED " My God ! " Vridar said . Neloa screamed and came to him , frantic. " 0 Vridar , what have you done ! " Vridar sat on the bed with the limp hushed child in his arms . " I 've killed him , " he said . He looked up at her and his face was as white as the child 's . Neloa screamed again . She tried to snatch the babe but Vridar pushed her away . " Be still , " he said . The whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and terrible silence everywhere . Putting an ear to the child 's breast he listened but he could hear nothing . " I 've killed him , " he said again . " I 've killed our son . " He looked at Neloa . She was shaking uncontrollably and twisting her hands and moaning . " Go call the police , " Vridar went on , speaking quietly . " But wait : where 's Mert 's gun ? " " 0 Vridar ! " " Go get it . " He stood up with the babe in his arms . " Hurry ! " " 0 Vridar , get a doctor , please ! " " A doctor ? " he said . He had not thought of a doctor . " You think he is n't  --  dead ? " " Maybe not ! And for God sake , hurry ! " Vridar sprang to a blanket and fetched it round the child and was out of the room , taking the stairway six steps at a time . Like a wild person he was down the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounding into a room . " Quick ! " he cried . " See if I 've killed my child ! " The amazed doctor looked at him and took the child . Neloa came into the room , wailing , and Vridar turned to her and said , " Please be still . " The doctor laid the limp babe on a couch and bent over it and Vridar saw the man 's hands moving up and down the spine . . . . " Neloa , please . " " Oh , I ca n't  --  help  --  it ! " Her words were choked and wild . It scared him a little to look at her . " He 's not dead , " the doctor announced . " He 's  --  not ? " WE ARE BETRAYED I4INeloa went to pieces now . She fell to the floor and screamed and Vridar bent over her . " Neloa , please ! " " Ohhhh ! " " Neloa ! " he said sharply . " Ohhhh ! " He had never heard such agony in a human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never seen such terrible eyes . Vridarleft her and went to the child . " Is he hurt ? " " He 'll be all right . What did you do ? " " I  --  I shook him . " Vridar felt whipped . He wanted someone to flog him : to take a great club and knock his brains out . But he was very quiet . He was always very quiet when faced by grave dangeror sudden terror . And now he smiled faintly , thinking of himself . Going to Neloa he lifted her and she shook in his arms and fainted against him and he sank to a chair and held her and looked at her white face . He kissed her white mouth . " It was a close call , " the doctor said . " There was a vertebraout of place in his neck . But he 's all right now . Just let him be quiet a while . " An hour later Vridar was back in his room . Neloa , still white and trembling , lay on the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her and stared blankly at a wall . He could see nothing and feel nothing except his dark and terrible childhood : the deep bowl of his home , the mad river , the desolate sky ; and a boy there , fighting through delirium ; a young man there , riding in frenzy over the Antelope Hills . . . . " Sweetheart , please come here . " It was all of one pattern : the drunkenness , too , and the blind rage of an hour ago : without relief , without change , the dark and terrible pattern of it , the desperate unbroken plot . It had all built to this hour ; and after this hour , what ? 142 WE ARE BETRAYEDThrough all his haunted years , death , like a shadow , had walked at his side : an escape , a way out . He had been seekingit : had he realized that , long ago ? Had he known ? . . . " Vridar , please . " He went over and knelt by the bed and put his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when he saw that she was weeping , he wept , too . She reached to him and he put his mouth to her hand and wept out of the awful bitterness of his life . In a little while he rose and went to the garage and entered the basement . He stared at the jug of whisky and then lifted it and hurled it crashing against a wall of stone . It was a flash of amber and glass and then it was only a handful of wet fragments and a sudden smell . He returned and knelt again by the bed . He put his lips to Neloa 's palm and for a long while he knelt here , sunk in desolationthat lay beyond grief . XVIIIWELL , " Vridar said , " I can look back now and see I 've WW been a terrible fool . All my life . I 've been a bootlegger and almost a drunkard . But I 've learned a lot in these months . About human nature , I mean . And I have no regrets . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did nothing that I have n't told you . I was not intimate with any women . I did n't even kiss a woman . Most persons would n't believe that but it 's true . Do you believe me ? " Neloa was looking at him . He thought there was doubt in her eyes . " Do you ? " " Yes , " she said . " Be honest . I wo n't go on with any doubt in your mind . I wo n't lie to you : life is n't worth it . . . . So be sure . That you believe me , I mean . " She was still looking at him . She was not smiling but there was a strange smile in her eyes and in her thoughts . " I believe you , " she said . " Do you want me to swear to it ? " " No . " " All right , we 'll call that settled . And except for our child do n't think I 'm sorry . I 'm not . True @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to school . I 'm through with whisky and cigarettes , pimps and whores . " He grinned faintly . " I 'm going to be a good fellow , you see . A model husband and father . A good citizen , strong and solid , like a pile of beef . I 'll be going to church soon . I 'll be rocking my child on my knee and saying da-da and goo-goo and oo-ittle-wubbity-wart . Virtues will be sticking out of me like candles out of a birthday cake . Squeeze me and I 'll break into prayer . Kick me and I 'll recite the Sermon on the Mount .... Well , does all that please you ? " " No . " " No ? Do you want me to be a rascal and a drunkard ? " 143144 WE ARE BETRAYED " Of course not ! " " All right , then . I 'll be a good fellow . I 'll say heck a-mighty and gosh ding it and dang the son-of-a-gun . I 'll drink soda-pop and milk and look refined and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If I say dang it and drink buttermilk , I ought to be able to write stuff that the women 's clubs will adore . A violet by a mossy stone and a bird singing Christmascarols : a Sunday school professor of writing like William Dean Howells . . . . " Well , we have enough money for this year . What we 'll do after that only God knows . Only gosh knows , I mean . Maybe I can get a fellowship or something . But what you must realize , my dear , is that it 's poverty for us . And I want you to go to school . You must like books . . . . Why the hell do n't you like books ? " he asked , scowling at her . " I do like books . " " You do n't but you 'll have to .

He read her eyes and was annoyed . " You need n't look that way ! " he cried . " Listen , Neloa , if you do n't want a-go with me you'n have a divorce . But now 's the time to make up your mind . To tell the plain damned truth , I 'll always be a fool , driving ahead . I 'll never be a da-da papa , watering the lawn and listening to the victrola . You know that . If you do n't , you ought to . And there 's something else . " He stared at her and considered . " Do you know the world is in a mess ? Do you know the Treaty of Versailles is nothing but a big stink and that Wilson 's head has more nonsense in it than mine has ? The light streams upon the path ahead and nowhere else ! he says . Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaten . Bombs are being sent through the mail to our crooked poliWEARE BETRAYED 145ticians . Cities are in riot . Aliens are being shipped out as if they were spuds .

Yes , lead , Kindly Light , we are following you all right ! " Neloa , I 'm a rebel . I 'll always be a rebel . That 's just as sure as the skin on your face . And right now 's the time to decide if you want to go with me or with someone else . . . Well ? " " You 're silly , " she said . " Of course I want to . " " Darling , be sure . " " I am sure . " " And you 'll never regret it ? " " No . " " No matter what happens ? " " No matter what happens . " " Come here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lap . " And you really love me ? " " No , " she said , frowning , " I hate you . " " That 's the stuff . Hate me with all your might . " He kissed her and she trembled in his arms . " Neloa , why do you love me ? Do you know ? " " Because you 're so crazy . " " Oh . But do n't you think we 'd be happier if we 'd never met ? " " I do not . " " But look at us . We 're not happy . " " We  --  we have our moments , " she said . And so it was that Vridar , after eight months of drunkennessand despair , found that his path had again turned and lay to the sun . Since September 6 , three years before , when Neloa wreaked confusion within him , he had been spending himself in aimless blind gestures at ruin and death . He had striven to purge himself of all his ideals and dreams and to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARE BETRAYEDhad been like a full sun on his back . He had sought sderground places for the meaning of life and had found and now , like a wanderer come home , he retired again ) oks . He dedicated his life again to the great empires of arship and creation . Alone with his wife and child , could live quietly in his home , quietly behind university L ; and he would find the meaning of life there . Like ) za , he would dwell in the kingdom of thought and his ns would come forth and ripen , and he would sit at last Le firelight of old age and fame . He would be a Socrates ig the young , leading them gently , patiently , into calm ectual pastures ; and when death came , it would find serenely gray and ready for the dark. out Spinoza was laid under an awful curse and the jour- ) f Socrates led to hemlock . Vridar thought he was done violent fury and desolate heartache ; and that he would ppy among books ; and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been shut away . He I see only five years of study , with a doctor 's degree , s cum laude , at the end : five years of exploration and th , five years of calm . Like a child he set about to gather iarvest , to brood in deep melancholy over books , and to his own . . . . le did not know what frenzied fire still ran in his blood . JULY 24 , 1901 . . . . And now , as he lay under this fearful decalogue , counting its commandments one by one , he felt rather sick and lost . That they were wise and good and that they were the radiance of Heaven , these he did not doubt ; but as he pondered them now , in the dark quiet of his mind , he could not see that they were a part of happiness and sunlight . He resolved , nevertheless , to be a mighty goodnessamong men , a magnificent demigod in the crusadeof right and mercy . He would play under the Creator 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The angels would look down at him and be pleased . . . . But though full of peace , though sheltered by the dim immensity of justice and right , there rose in his heart a vague doubt , a loneliness , that trembled and darkened . It was a faint intimation , a shadow thrown before , of the bleak waste of effort , the regret and sunless years and nightmare , to which his promises were to lead him . . . . And at last , troubled by this that he could not understand , and by a leering and grotesque shadow beyond the decalogue , he drew quilts over him and began to weep . Two hours later he was buried and dreaming . His two hands were clenched , his cheeks were wet . IN SALT LAKE CITY again , they lived in a big dark room with a gas-plate in a closet . On weekends Vridar helped launder their clothes , even washing the diapers ; and he scrubbed the floor . He walked into the city and bought groceries and rode back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if the weather was fine , he would carry the child and he and Neloa would walk in Liberty Park and breathe the Indian summer of trees . Vridar loved this city of wide streets , sprawled on a mountainside and fenced around with peaks . When he stood by his window on October days , he could see it spread below him like a great yellow jungle , with a golden valley below it and blue mountains beyond . . . . Only rarely did they go to a show ; because Lincoln would fret and yelp and Vridar detested persons who brought squawling infants into theaters . Most of his time he spent with his writing and his books . " My God , " he would say , " but I 'm an ignorant fool ! " And he would come home with a stack of books and read in frenziedhaste until midnight : now laying a book aside and opening another , now trying to read two at once ; and feelingupon him the swift passing of time . From all these books he made notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English Literature ; and his notes from these volumes alone were an armful . And he ranged out into philosophy and comparative religions and a score of other fields : entering a realm and searching in feverish haste ; pausing to meditate , lost in wonder and dream ; trying to see to the boundaries of knowledge and to the circumference of what men had explored ; and then , with fresh hunger , seizing a half-dozen books and going swiftly to his room . And while he scanned pages during the long evenings he became unaware of himself , and the only world was the world of1511 f 2 WE ARE BETRAYEDmind ; the only meaning was thought , flowing from page to page to the volume 's end . When a thought touched him more intimately , like a sudden hand on his shoulder , he would pause and look at Neloa , with the thought building a troubled light in his brain . " Listen , " he would say and he would read the lines to her . And Neloa would listen and she would strive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Vridar would ask ; and he would get to his feet and walk about , with the wonder of the thing holding his breath . Sometimes he was made drunk with a thought and he would pace like a man caged : he would gesture , as if reaching to meanings , or he would talk the thing out of him , building his words into a silhouette ; or he would stand still and let the idea slowly possess him and fill him with light ... . " Neloa , listen to this . . . . Are you listening ? " " Yes . " " This man J. E. Boodin says , ' The nature and test of truth are not to be confused with the practical motive that leads to the seeking of it . ' And that 's true ! . . . Shall I read it again ? " Neloa puckered her brows , as she always did when bewildered by what he read . He repeated the line and asked : " Do you know what that means ? " " I  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Vridar , " that most persons test truth by the motive that leads them to seek it . It means they 're not really seeking it . That explains the quarrel between Darwinism and the Church . . . . Do you see ? " " I guess so . " " This is a swell book , " he said ; and he turned it over and over , looking at it fondly . " It 's MacIntosh , The Problem of Knowledge . . . . God , it 's a swell book ! " And again : " Neloa , here 's an idea for you . Listen . " And from the big book on his knees Vridar read : " ' Mr. Marett has shown that a prayer which relies on the use of a name of power '  --  like God , " Vridar said , glancing at Neloa , " ' is not far reWEARE BETRAYED 153moved from a spell or magical incantation .

Do you know what the crucifixion meant ? You know what the idea of virgin birth came from ? You do n't . You 've got to read this book , Neloa . It will knock all that silly Mormonism out of you . " Neloa looked troubled . " If I read all the books you want me to read I 'd have to live a thousand years . " " Nonsense ! I do n't bring you many .

" And again : " Neloa , here 's a whale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man who understands , the Self has become all things , what sorrow , what trouble , can there be to him who once beheld that unity ?

If  --  if it 's true  --  well . But how the hell can the Self become all things ! Damn it , that would be hypnosis . A man would have to be a Hindu , would n't he ? " " It looks like it , " Neloa said . " And there would n't be any suffering , " Vridar went on , speaking to himself , really . " A unity . A union of what , I wonder . Lord , if my Self were to become all things , complete , a unit for me , what would happen to you ? What would ? " he asked , turning to her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neloa was distressed . She was trying so hard to grasp this notion of the creative life. 154 WE ARE BETRAYED " It seems to me I 'd be a pretty selfish wart , " he went on . " Is the creative life a selfish life ? . . . I 'll have to think about that . " And again : " Neloa , I 've been on the wrong track . I should n't be writing plays . " " Why ? " Neloa asked . " Plays are going out of fashion . This fellow  --  it 's Literatureand Insurgency  --  says the novel is the expression of modern life . Underwood . Maybe he does n't know what he 's talking about . " He rose and paced , reading the book . " Damn it ! " he cried suddenly ; and Neloa jumped . " I want to write novels and poetry . Who the hell ever got me off on plays ? ... It was Donnaugh . Hell , I should be writing a novel . " " Well , " Neloa asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . Donnaugh and his one-act plays can go to grass . " Not only did Vridar quest among books , searching the waste of their pages for the few meanings that were sharp and clear . He wrote also : with emotion surging upward in storm and pouring like driven wind over and around an idea ; with the idea lost , like the core of quiet in a cyclone ; with the idea typed to a page in a jungle of eloquence and rhetoric , in thickets of metaphor and simile , in sonorous orchestrations of adjectives and verbs ; until , upon reading what he had typed , he was lost in sensuous wilderness . His allegory would be a pattern so rich and deep with color that he would see no meaning , no coherence , in the heaped voluptuous masses of his effort ; and feel only intoxication and chaos , as when he stared at the formless tumbled glories of a sunset . For his one-act plays were purple parables draped like velvet upon the volcanic crater of an idea . They swung away in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumultuousovertones , with the puppets buried under headlong and sensuous nothingness . And his poems , too , were seething rhetoric . The first line of a sonnet would take off like aWE ARE BETRAYED : 155rocket and burst into thirteen lines of flame . His shorter lyrics were terrible and voiceless intensity , like a wild thing in a closed palm ; and his epigrams , of which he wrote many , were a half-truth choked red in the face by bombast . And toward all of it he was dubious . " An emotion pours out of me , " he said to Ncloa , " and it seems damned swell . But a month later it 's cold . It 's as if I set a child to play and returned to find it dead . . . . " But this feeling Professor Will Donnaugh did not share . Vridar , he declared , was the most promising student he had ever had ; and he had taught creative writing for a long while . And Donnaugh 's enthusiasm grew as the weeks passed . One day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Vridar , and crying , " If Dunsany had written this they 'd be shoutinghis name around the world ! " Whereupon , feeling that he had stepped too completely out of his dignity , like a naked man out of a bathroom , he called Vridar to him and gave him a sober round-faced lecture . " Your play can be improved . This is weak . You have no dramatic suspense here . This metaphor is grotesque . Never get the idea that your work ca n't be improved ... . " Have you read Pinero ? " " Yes . " " Like him ? He 's a great dramatist . " " I do n't like him . " " Tusk . You 're getting too sure of yourself . The creativespirit is humble and childlike . . . . Look , you 'll have to revise that . " And Donnaugh thrust a short finger at the turgid hysterical rhapsody of a nymph . Vridar often wondered about this man . Donnaugh was short and plump and round , with a fat round face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or were shadowed with malice . Students adored him , nevertheless , and looked upon him as a great man ; and Vridar , too , liked him , with a steady affection , a warm vigorous esteem , that were to stand invincible against the years . But he was not blind to thei6 WE ARE BETRAYEDman 's tremendous vanity , and in the classroom he studied him , noting his dynamic energy and his unaffected enthusiasm for the subjects he taught ; his rather pompous and oracular manner ; his morbid hunger for achievement and the esteem of his fellows ; and his deliberate and cunning pretense to more knowledge than he had . Because Donnaugh , like most of the instructors whom Vridar had known , strove , with tags of Latin , words from Greek , and allusions to the far and obscure , to hold his students in awe ; and most of them he held there . Beyond his booming ardor and his outpouringof dates and data was the boyish vanity of the zealot . " But none of us are perfect , " Vridar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort and I am , I know , one of the worst donkeysin Christendom . Donnaugh rolls his tongue in his fat mouth as if tasting his vowels , as if chewing his consonants . He has a lot of silly mannerisms that are intended to knock you off your legs . But he stands head and shoulders above everyone in his department . He 's no Pelley : that tirelessspecialist in the trivial . I-1e 's no Bush : that erotic old fiddlesnort with his grand manner of a gentleman and his huge and vicarious impulses to seduction . And he 's no Ackworthwith his two-by-four belief in Mormonism and Milton . . . . " I like him . " " Did he like your last play ? " " He said he did . But I do n't think it 's so mountainous . " And at once Vridar dug among his papers and fetched out a play and read it again . " No , " he said , " it 's all wind and wheezes . It limps and finally sits down . Neloa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critic . As it is now I 'm just writing big blurts of nonsense in the fat succulent tradition of the English landlords . It 's no good . I know it 's no good .... " On a day in February Donnaugh called Vridar to his office . His manner was round and apple-cheeked and with a gesWEARE BETRAYED 157ture at Vridar he dismissed the trivial . " Sit down , " he said . Vridar sat ; and for a long moment Donnaugh busied himself with stacks of paper on his desk . He was , Vridar knew , merely pawing them over , sensing to the fullest his new position . He merely sat there , plump and efficient , among his tremendous duties , happily feeling their weight in the scales of his life . Then he swung . " You 'll be graduated in June , wo n't you ? " " I hope so . " " And then what ? " " I do n't know . " Donnaugh laughed . He laughed often but his laugh was mirthless , as if he played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to teach in a college ? " " I 'd like it , sure . But " Donnaugh exploded another mirthless volley . His fair skin was dyed red and his blue eyes twinkled with jolly mischief . He pursed his mouth and chuckled . Vridar looked at him and grinned and his thought went back to Turner of his high school years . " How would you like to teach in my department ? " " In your department ! Here ? " Donnaugh shook again ; his eyes were full of dancing twinkles . And then , casting off fellowship , he stiffened until he looked like a Harvard man . " Hunter , I 'm about to offer you a position here . " " You are ? " " But wait . On one condition : that you go east to school this summer . . . . Will you go ? " " Uhh  --  I ' 11 try .

" Well , " he said , " look me over . I 've just been offered a huge job . " " You have ? 0 darling ! " " Yep , " he said . " Dean of Education . " He winked at her . " You think I 'll make a good dean ? " " Vridar , tell me ! " " Head janitor . " " No ! Vridar , I 'll shake you . " " Come and shake me . . . . Come on , I like it . It titillates me .
