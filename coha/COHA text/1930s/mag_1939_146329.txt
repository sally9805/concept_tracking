Franklin Roosevelt announced last Christmastide that he would leave to the nation all his private papers since 1910 ( numbering some 8,000,000 items ) if admirers would build , with private funds , a repository for them at Hyde Park on land which he would donate , and if Congress would keep it up in perpetuity with public funds . Last week this offer lay before the House for acceptance . To Mr. Roosevelt 's admirers ' dismay , it was declined . <P> Brought up first on the unanimous consent calendar , the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library Bill needed a two-thirds vote after Democrat Kent Keller of Illinois objected to postponing consideration , called for suspension of the rules . Opposition to the plan then became explicit . <P> " Why not provide for their keeping in the Archives Building in the national capital ? " asked Republican John Schafer of Wisconsin . <P> Illinois ' Keller : " The building was built so small that it is not in a position to take these papers . " <P> Democratic Leader Sam Rayburn got so mad he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just because he happens to be Franklin D. Roosevelt . " The losing vote was 229-to-139 , 49 short of two-thirds . The bill had to go back for rerouting through the Rules Committee . <P> Next day Franklin Roosevelt unveiled another plan he had been nursing . He nominated for Librarian of Congress one of the eminent literary persons whom he had consulted on the Hyde Park library idea : Poet Archibald MacLeish , 47 . <P> Now the House rafters rang indeed with opposition . Republican John Parnell Thomas of New Jersey , member of the Dies Un-American Activities Committee , leaped up to flay Poet MacLeish as a " fellow traveler " of the Communist Party , a cofounder of the League of American Writers ( " of the 23 , twelve were well-known Communists " ) , an active sympathizer with Loyalist Spain . <P> Again Sam Rayburn leaped to the defense . " What is a ' fellow traveler ? ' " he roared . <P> " A man who is absolutely sympathetic with the Communist cause , but for various reasons does not care to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas . " The Administration is now , and has been for some time , placing people in key positions who are either members of the Communist Party or fellow travelers . . . . " <P> " Little short of slander ! " roared Sam Rayburn . <P> The MacLeish appointment was , of course , none of the House 's business . But to the Senate , whence his confirmation must come , went protests against Poet MacLeish based on charges-more considerable than " Communism " - to which he humbly pleaded guilty . In announcing the appointment , Mr. Roosevelt explained that ever since 77-year-old Dr. Herbert Putnam ( 40 years Librarian , emeritus since last year ) asked to be relieved , a search had been afoot for a successor possessing the many qualifications required . Mr. Roosevelt had finally decided that technical assistants could be hired for a librarian whose attainments as " gentleman and a scholar " are world renowned . To this , President Milton James Ferguson of the American Library Association , head of Brooklyn 's public library , replied :    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
