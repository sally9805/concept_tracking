txt Drought apparently has taken a lighter toil of Canada 's wheat crop than on this side of the international border line . This was the interpretation offered by grain trade authorities following a Dominion Government report last night which suggested a June 30 condition figure of 82C2 . However , it was recognized that further deterioration has occurred in Canada since , the end of June . The current Canadian report failed to give a preliminary estimate of wheat acreage this year , but B. W. Snow , Bartlett Frazier Co. crop expert , said that assuming an acreage of 23 , - 300.000 of Spring wheat for the three prairie provinces , the report will represent for Manitoba , Saskatchewan and Alberta a total crop forecast of about 321.000,000 bushels . Last year 's final estimate for the three provinces was 260,000,000 . Trade commentators felt Mr Snow 's acreage figures were conservatively low . In addition the Government report was somewhat higher than the trade had anticipated in view of the Searle Grain Co. ' s recent survey indicating 70% conditions , which would suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only three days later than the Government figure . It was felt that it Canada should raise close to 300.000.000 bushels of new wheat  --  and that figure would include 15.000. - 000 Fall wheat  --  all would be available for export . The carryover of 125,000.000 bushels August 1 will be more than sufficient to take care of 105,000,000-bushel home needs .
