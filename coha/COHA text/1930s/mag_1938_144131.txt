Ever since Franklin Delano Roosevelt entered the White House , Germans have been extremely watchful of his attitude toward Adolf Hitler 's Government , have rated the President discreetly but definitely anti-Nazi . Adolf Hitler was never more vehemently sincere than when he welcomed to Berlin last week the new U. S. Ambassador , Career Diplomat Hugh R. Wilson , with what the Fhrer called " vivid satisfaction ! " <P> " It is my earnest wish that the maintenance and development of friendly relations and bonds which prevail between our two countries may be deepened and strengthened while I am here , " said Mr. Wilson . <P> Germans particularly criticized the seedy air and ill-fitting clothes of Professor Dodd . They highly approved the arrival of Ambassador Wilson in faultless full dress , white tie and the black waistcoat correct in Europe on such occasions . Der Fhrer , although he addresses the Reichstag and makes nearly all his public appearances in the khaki of a simple Storm Trooper , received Ambassador Wilson dressed exactly like him .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
