txt After more than an hour of debate yesterday the Aldermanic branch of the Municipal Assembly voted to continue the city 's $67 , - 000,000 emergency relief tax program until July 1 , 1937 , under authority granted by the last Legislature . The Aldermen concurred in the earlier action of the Board of Estimate branch , which voted unanimously for the continuance at a special meeting . The taxes are contained in four bills that have been in effect since December , 1934 . The city 's 2 per cent sales tax yielded $43,000,000 last year . The city tax on utilities yielded $18,000,000 and the gross business tax brought about $6,500 , - 000 . The personal property tax , aimed at blocking sales tax evaders who buy outside the city and bring their purchases in , brought about $250,000 . Calls Measures a Model Former Alderman Morton Baum , now special tax counsel for the Finance Department , said part of the yield had been collected in the last weeks of 1934 . He estimated an average annual yield from the four levies at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax measures were the envy of every city and State in the country . Thomas J. Curran , Republican minority leader of the board , objected to immediate passage of the tax bills and sought to have them referred to committee for study . Referring to new members of the board who have taken their seats since the original tax measures were passed , he said these new members should have an opportunity to study the bills before voting on them . Acting Aldermanic President Timothy J/ Sullivan pointed out that each of the bills was accompanied by an emergency message from Mayor La Guardia asking immediate adoption . He said time would be saved if the measures were spared the usual routine of committee study . Murray W. Stand , majority leader , pressed for an immediate vote , saying there had been nc change in the measures since the Aldermen had first acted upon them in 1934 . Mr. Curran argued that the original intent of the four-point tax program had been to raise $50,000,000 . Since the actual revenues ran close to $67,000,000 , he held that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent . His motion to refer the bills to committee was defeated by a vote of fifty to eight . The Sales Tax Bill went through with forty-nine votes in favor . Mr. Curran and Aldermen Joseph E. Kinsley , Samson Inselbuch and James J. Paretti refrained from voting . The remaining three measures were approved by votes of 53 to nothing . The utility tax carries a 3 per cent levy . The board adopted Mr. Curran 's resolution asking every city commissioner to list the number of WPA workers in his department who are doing work formerly done by civil service employes . " The Finance Committee , when it is preparing the city budget , is told that thousands of these WPA men are scattered through the city departments , " Mr. Curran said . " It is incredible to me that none of them is doing work formerly done by civil service employes . " I have no axe to grind here , but I do want to find out how many civil service people were dismissed under the Economy Act two years ago , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't do to say that we did n't have the money to keep these men on  --  the tax bills we have passed today will raise close to $70,000,000 . " We see in the newspapers a report by Purchase Commissioner Russell Forbes in which he says that WPA workers are demoralizing his department . Re says by inference that these men are doing work formerly done by civil service : men . Many of these WPA men receive more salary than the civil service man gets . Naturally , under those circumstances , the morale of a department will be undermined and the work will suffer . Pleads for Civil Service " If WPA men are doing work that could be done by civil service men , the latter group should have the preference . If the WPA workers are doing work that was not considered necessary formerly , they should be dismissed . The civil service men need their jobs and many of them have contributed to relief funds for the last few years . " The justices of the Supreme Court and the Appellate Division got their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear them . Of course , we know these justices are drafted for their positions on the bench , but there are many attorneys in this city who would like to be drafted too . " Alderman Joseph E. Kinsley of the Bronx asked for an amendment to the Curran resolution to call for data on how many WPA employes in city departments were non-citizens . He said Mr. Curran 's resolution marked the beginning of a " beautiful friendship " between the minority leader and himself . Mr. Curran demurred , however , and the Kinsley amendment was lost . " That looks like the end of the beautiful friendship , " remarked Mr. Stand , who was presiding . Mr. Curran said he hoped to get answers to- his query before the Aldermen adjourn.for the Summer .
