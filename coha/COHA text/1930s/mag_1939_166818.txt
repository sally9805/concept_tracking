There are only two airlines in the world which cancel flights when the weather is too good . They are both in China-Eurasia Aviation Corp . ( partly German-owned ) and China National Aviation Corp . ( partly owned by Pan American Airways ) - and the reason for their idiosyncrasy is that their courses lie over Japanese-held territory , and Japanese aviators like to shoot down any Chinese plane in sight , civil or military . Each line has had one plane shot down , several wrecked on the ground , many chased by the Japanese . Fourteen passengers have been killed . <P> Despite the fact that these lines fly mostly at night , usually in filthy weather , over terrain which alternates fantastic Chinese-print mountains with treacherous rice-paddy terraces , they have had no serious accidents which were not brought on by Japanese guns . Because traditional modes of transportation in free China-oxcart , ass , camel , over miserable roads-are unbearably slow , and because trucks so often break down in Chinese hands , these lines are so heavily booked that some passengers have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always filled to maximum capacity . Eurasia flies Junkers , C. N. A. C. flies Douglases , and both use German Telefunken wireless compasses and direction-finders-among the best in the world . <P> Last week C. N. A. C. inaugurated a new service between Chungking , capital of China , and Rangoon , capital of Burma . The famed Burma Road is the most important ground line of communications between free China and the outside world , and for those who must see that China gets the essential materials of war , the parallel air route is indispensable . <P> Most interesting to the 14 passengers on the inaugural flight was a stop they made , in a cut in the Burma jungle just outside the China border . There , miles from civilization of any sort , they found a community of 15 U. S. experts , their families , nearly 1,000 Chinese workers , living in a modern town with electric lights , running water , bungalows , playgrounds , and a $4,000,000 plant of U. S.-owned Central Aircraft Co. which will produce fighting planes to help China win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
