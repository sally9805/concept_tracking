The greatest Greek of modern times died last week far from the rocky headlands he loved . <P> Eleutherios ( " Liberty " ) Venizelos , 72 , " Father of the Greek Republic , " who was born on what was the Turkish island of Crete , singlehanded doubled the area of modern Greece , tripled its population , dethroned and throned its Kings , led its only winning wars and won for it a prestige based , not on its actual importance , but on the respect his character had won at the council tables of Europe . As last week opened he was in exile in Paris , beloved of half the Greeks , hated by the other half . Grippe settled in his lungs . His old heart was tired . It stopped . The most important political fact in Greece this week was that Venizelos was dead . <P> Exactly a year ago Venizelos fought a bloody civil war primarily to forestall Greek Royalists from recalling King George II . He lost , and the world Press wrote his political obituary . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elections two months ago , and it appeared that old " Liberty " was still in the thick of Greek politics , by mail and telegraph . What had happened was that , after King George 's recall , both the King and Venizelos had discovered that Fascist-minded General George Kondylis was far more dangerous to them both than either of them was to the other . King George personally granted Venizelos amnesty and Venizelos wrote , " I say from my heart , ' Vive le Roi ! ' " Nevertheless he prudently stayed on in Paris . <P> The sudden death of General Kondylis eased His Majesty 's position by removing the onetime Dictator who was trying to rule the King ( TIME , Feb. 10 ) . The sudden death last week of M. Venizelos profoundly disturbed the ticklish balance of power in Athens between Venizelists and the Army which is seething with ambitions for a coup d ' tat . As always since the War the stabilizing influence in Greece remained British influence . The millionaire widow of M. Venizelos is the daughter of a British-nationalized Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Basil Zaharoff . King George II himself went direct from London to resume the Greek Throne as the protg of King George V and London bankers ( TIME , Dec. 2 ) . As Greek church bells tolled for Venizelos and Greek flags flew at half mast , Greek censors passed Athens dispatches in which correspondents agreed that the Venizelos party will soon evaporate , leaving a most ominous void .
