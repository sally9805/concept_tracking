Where General Johnson 's bullyragging and President Roosevelt 's patriotic pleas had failed , 30,000 determined coal miners in Pennsylvania scored a major success for NRA last week . Only after they defied their union leaders and started another strike which threatened to engulf the industry were mine operators sufficiently terrified to sign a soft coal code . <P> First big strike of the NRA occurred last July in the same Pennsylvania coal fields ( TIME , Aug. 7 et seq . ) . Starting in Fayette County , 50,000 miners walked out in protest against the operators ' refusal to recognize John Llewellyn Lewis ' United Mine Workers . Riot , bloodshed and death preceded Governor Pinchot 's declaration of martial law and his dispatch of guardsmen . A temporary peace was patched up when President Roosevelt sent Deputy Administrator McGrady into the coal fields as his personal emissary to promise the strikers a square deal under NRA . With mining resumed , coal code negotiations at Washington settled down into a long pull-dick-pull-devil between operators and Union Leader Lewis . General Johnson coaxed , wheedled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivet a code of his own on the industry . Last week he changed his mind , turned back to hard-boiled diplomacy . <P> Leader of the July strike was a young Irish redhead named Martin Ryan . He was president of the U. M. W. local at Colonial No. 4 mine of H. C. Frick Coke Co. , U. S. Steel Corp . subsidiary . His glib influence over fellow workers was greater than that of Leader Lewis whose code activities in Washington Miner Ryan distrusted . He harangued the men out of the pits when Lewis implored them to stick . He was the last to consent to a compromise with the operators . As delay followed delay on the code , he blew hot words on the miners ' discontent . Why was there no code yet ? Because the operators were stalling for time . Why did they want time ? So they could mine a surplus of coal at low wages and then shut down and sell it at a big profit when a code was forced on them. * Only a strike would break up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Pricedale . It was a rowdy meeting from which six men were ejected before it voted a " holiday " for 30,000 workers . Outside Hungarian Hall thousands of United Miners cheered the decision to defy their national leader and follow Insurgent Ryan . <P> Early next morning 400 strikers gathered at the Gates mine of the Frick company , 15 mi. from , Uniontown . Six mine bosses followed by a few maintenance men started to shove through the pack . A picket leader jostled a mine guard . Stones began to fly . " Let ' em have it ! " roared a mine boss . Bang-bang-bang went the mine guards ' guns . Tear gas enveloped the strikers . One guard shot another guard 's arm off by mistake . Fifteen strikers were dropped by bullets , their names a typical roster of U. S. mine labor : Louis Kromer , Steve Hrosky , George Ely , Anton Maura , Walter Ordorsky , Paul Popson , Mason Robert , George Hroska , Joe Goletz , Mike Budman , James Shannon , George Illeg , Vincent Stunga , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was barely dragged to safety before an oncoming freight train . For the shootings a mine boss and six guards were clapped into jail .
