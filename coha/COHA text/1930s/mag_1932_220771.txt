Last week Col. Henry Breckinridge , friend and legal adviser of Col. Charles Augustus Lindbergh , left his client 's side for the first time in more than two months , flew to the Kentucky Derby . John Hughes Curtis , Norfolk , Va . boat builder , vanished on another of his mysterious yacht cruises . <P> Other agents and agencies in the search for Col. Lindbergh 's kidnapped child seemed no closer to success than they were on the windy night of March 1 , when the baby was snatched from his New Jersey nursery . But in Washington last week another fantastic sideshow in the case was revealed . Principal in this show was a bad actor who first came to fame in the Harding era - Gaston Bullock Means . <P> Bad Actor Means , 53 , a thick-necked , slackjawed , dimpled-cheeked Southerner , is the author of The Strange Death of President Harding in which it is intimated that Mrs. Harding poisoned her husband ( TIME , March 31 , 1930 ) . The book was written after Means had served three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violation of the Prohibition laws . Before that he had turned on his employer , onetime Attorney General Harry Micajah Daugherty , with tall tales before a Senate Committee about the " Ohio Gang 's " activities . Before the U. S. entered the War , he says , he served with the German spy system in the U. S. , once received $1,000,000 from a German agent at a midnight rendezvous in Trinity Churchyard , Manhattan . Further in his past lies an astounding record of crime and near-crime . At one time or another , Gaston Means , a sleuth by profession , has been indicted for breach of promise , impersonating an officer , fraud , bribery , forgery , murder . He once told a Senate committee that ' ' being indicted " was his business . Last November he was arrested for beating his wife . <P> It was no great surprise to Gaston Means when a U. S. deputy marshal and a special Department of Justice agent stopped his expensive , chauffeured car on Washington 's Massachusetts Avenue one day last week and took him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apprehended was , however , startling : that he had bilked affluent Mrs. Evelyn Walsh McLean , owner of the Hope Diamond , estranged wife of the publisher of the Washington Post and Cincinnati Enquirer , out of $106,000 on the pretext that he could help her find the Lindbergh baby . <P> Rich Mrs. McLean , a mining tycoon 's daughter much in the Washington lime light , interested herself in the Lindbergh kidnapping as early as March 4 . In 1919 she , too , had lost her firstborn ; 9-year-old Vinson , the " Hundred-Million-Dollar Baby " who slept in a crib decorated with gold , gift of Leopold , King of the Belgians . In an unguarded moment her child was ground to death under an automobile 's wheels . Mrs. McLean remembered Gaston Means from the good old Harding days when her husband played poker with the Ohio Gang , decided to hire him to trace the Lindbergh baby . A conference was arranged attended by Captain Emory S. Land , U. S. N. , Col. Lindbergh 's cousin , and Rev. Francis J. Hurney , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that the presence of a cleric in the negotiations would cement the kidnappers ' confidence .
