txt Ohio 's Republican State Committee has the honor of being the first State machine to offer renomination to Mr. HOOVER . There were but two dissenting votes , one and perhaps both of them survivals of the grudges left by the defeat of the late Senator WILLIS as an aspirant to the Presidency in 1928 . Almost unanimous , the committee was sublimely generous . It voted to let Mr. 1100-vEa 's manager pick out the delegates to the National Convention . So Postmaster General BROWN gets what may be called a free delivery of delegates . An all-Hoover delegation is looked for . " The boys " are edifyingly docile . The Buckeye bigwigs have set an instructive example , not perhaps needed , to similar bodies the date of whose disciplined , if restrained , enthusiasm is later . In Chicago the leaders of those Republican factions so incomprehensible to outsiders seem to be in their usual state of disgruntlement . They have reason to be down-in-themouth , but their choice of a pickme-up is curious , if the political reporter of The Chicago Tribune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee and other chiefs of credit and renown are said to be in their almost permanent condition of worry about the State and county tickets . Every prospect is displeasing . How can those tickets be " strengthened " so as to endure better the storms of next Fall ? Who is to be the fortifier , the rescuer ? HIRAM JOHNSON , that wellknown summoner of " the rank and file . " The senders of the Cook County S 0 S are " not particular friends " of HIRAM , but they have some unexplained mysterious belief in his powers as a medicine man . Perhaps if they were his particular friends they would advise him to keep off the premises . He is still making up his mind , the mere mass of which forbids hasty ratiocination . Shall he go into the Illinois Presidential primaries ? The word from Washington is that his dubitations are . these : First , can a sufficient purse to pay for the running be raised ? As to that , Chicago 's official poverty must not be attributed to those prodigal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with his name . Is it not his duty to show how a statesman of the antique type can go through a primary campaign , even in FRANK LESLIE SMITH 'S State , with a frugality that would male Poor Richard look like a spendthrift ? Dubitation Number 2 and chief is too much for our darkened mind and therefore tossed to the deeprevolving reader : If JOHNSON managed to lead a successful revolt and thwart the nomination of HOOVER , would the convention nominate HIRAM ? Does that mean if he should be successful in Illinois , or would he be successful if he were successful , or does it merely indicate an unworthy suspicion in his mind that after he had done the hunting , somebody else would bag the game ? Sometimes one has an uneasy feeling that this sagest and solemnest of men is being " queered " ; that the Progressives , having failed to " queer " one another , have tried to make a victim of serious old regressive HIRAM and are waiting to see if he will swallow .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
