txt The Morgan hearing , which had been droning on through a dull , steaming morning , exploded just before adjournment today into a threecornered row involving Senator Glass , Ferdinand Pecora , counsel , for the committee , and Senator Fletcher , chairman . It had been ' simmering for three days , everybody had been awaiting it , and Sen-ator Glass finally precipitated it by asking what the examination was all about , anyway . The complicated details of the I organization and financing of the United Corporation , a large public utility holding company , whose ' books are kept in the offices of 1J . P. Morgan &; Co. , had made the moist heat of the room even more unbearable . The fact that Morgan &; Co. and the Bonbright Electric Corporation had each received 1,000,000 option warrants for $1 a warrant , each warrant entitling the holder to buy a share of common stock of United at any subsequent date at $27.50 , was developed during the day with George H. Howard , president of the company , on the witness stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was formed it took over from J. P. Morgan &; Co. stock in utilities at a price $12 , - 000,000 under their market value . At that time , January , 1928 , the market value was figured at $55 , - 566,644 . In return J. P. Morgan &; Co. received 400,000 shares of common stock , for which they paid $10,000,000 , and 1,000,000 option warrants for common stock , for which $1 each was paid . They received another 710,000 option warrants at another time . The same arrangement was made with Bonbright Electric Corporation . Senatorial Storm Breaks . The way in which the United Corporation , was built up out of the holdings in many utility companies serving a population of nearly half the entire country , and its relation to J. P. Morgan &; Co. , had been told frankly by Mr. Howard for an hour and a half when the storm broke . Senator Glass had shorn frequent signs of impatience , and finally asked if the ' Federal Trade Commission had criticized the transactions , or asked that activities be modified ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the law . When he was told that there had been no complaints and no violation of law , he settled back in his chair and said : " I would just like to know what it Is all about . " Senator Couzens asked the same question , but what he had in mind was quite different . as was shown after Mr. Pecora read the Senate resolution under which the committee is proceeding , for he then inquired if that were not a complete answer to the Senator from Virginia . " No , it is not , " snapped Mr. Glass , shoving forward in his seat angrily . He is a small man , his face usually pale , and at this time his scant white hair stood up on the front of his head . His voice was harsh with anger . Senator Fletcher , the chairman , started to say that what Mr. Pecora had read was the authority on which the committee was acting , when the Virginian exclaimed : " Hold on . The Senator from Virginia is going to express himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent him from ex- , pressing himself . " Which he did , largely to the ef-1 fect that Mr. Pecora should have I talked over his procedure with the committee . Neither could he find any authorization for Mr. Pecora ' s employment on the minutes of the subcommittee . However , there was no question about it , he said in the ' next breath . Pecora Between Two Senators . During this colloquy Mr. Pecora sat silently between Senators Glass and Fletcher , his swarthy face slightly flushed . Evidently he repressed his emotions with some difficulty . Sitting as they were together , no greater contrast between men could be imagined . Mr. Fletcher , who is 74 , only a year younger than Mr. Glass , is usually mild and unobtrusive . His voice is low , and unlike Mr. Glass 's , does not carry . His face is red . and he usually holds a cigar in one hand just under his nose , and looks calmly on . But just now he was glaring at Mr. Glass with all the intensity of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the argument long enough to explain the purposes of his examination , and said that he thought what had already been accomplished had thrown much light on the way securities had been marketed . and that the continuation of the hearings would bring out more useful information . Senator Glass asked him why he could n't have made that statement previously to the committee , and Mr. Pecora exclaimed that if he had come to Washington to consult the committee every time he learned something important , he would have commuted between New York and Washington . Senator Glass said they were wasting valuable time listening to questions and answers which were of " no significance to a man of ordinary intelligence . " At that Mr. Pecora blew up . and turning toward Mr. Glass told of outlining his questionnaire and plan of procedure to the committee , since which time he had not received a single request for information as to what he was doing . " And I want to add that I did not seek this assignment , " Mr. Pecora said . " I appreciated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for service in having been asked to serve as committee counsel . And I want to assure Senator Glass that the compensation of $255 which I am receiving for these services certainly is no incentive to me to render these services or to continue to render them . " That was as near as he came to a suggestion of resigning , and as he finished , there was a long burst of applause from the spectators By this time many of those who had seats along the sides of the room were standing up , , leaning forward to hear and see what was going on . Mr. Glass looked around sarcastically , and when there was quiet again , said : " Oh , yes , that is what it is all about . We are having a circus , Mr. Morgan , who had been listening all morning to the story of United Corporation as if it were the first time he had heard of the concern and who had worn a pleasant half-smile , was now sitting in a position of polite reserve , slowly rubbing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slouched far down in his chair , rolling a cigar in his mouth , and George Whitney had also lowered his long form as far out of sight ' as possible , as if a little bit ashamed of the scene . Mr. Glass came back to the charge by saying he had been opposed to the small counsel fee ar-ranged , but that he did not " imagine that counsel for the committee is working just for the $255 a month . Far from it " The fireworks died down when Mr. Pecora denied making a state-ment published in the newspapers that he had threatened to resign during the executive session on stock lists , or that he had divulged the results of the vote . Mr. Glass backed him up by saying no threat of resignation had been made . But Mr. Fletcher had not yet had his part in the argument , and he turned to Mr. Glass to say that Mr. Pecora had been proceeding in accordance with the instructions of the committee , and that he was proud of the work Mr. Pecora had done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now red with anger , and shaking his finger at Senator Fletcher . - " I am perfectly indifferent to clamor or applause . " he said . " I want that understood . I do not care anything about the House of Morgan . The House of Morgan never loaned me a dollar in their lives , and very likely never would . But as one member of this committee I do not intend to see any injustice done to the House of Morgan or any other house . " And I want to call to the attention of this committee that the only sentence of statutory legislation that has been put upon the books , that has been offered in either branch of Congress , was framed by me . " That ended it , and the committee adjourned until Wednesday morning . As members of the House of Morgan went out , Thomas W. Lamont said : " It 's too bad , too bad . " In executive session the committee voted against making public the articles of copartnership of J. P. Morgan &; Co .. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm . The hearings were adjourned until next Wednesday morning . and the only things lacking now are peanuts and colored lemonade . " The attitude of the Morgan group OF MORGAN INQUIRY showed that they were as dumfounded at what was occurring as any one else .
