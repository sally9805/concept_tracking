( See front cover ) <P> It is humidly hot in Sumatra ; the intense sunlight encourages luxuriant plant life . One of the chief Sumatran products is , as all the world knows , rubber . South American rubber is garnered mainly from wild trees , carried through jungle paths . In the Far East and Middle East the business is much more highly organized . To handle the product roads have been built , heavy trucks imported ; railroad tracks have been laid . The only primitive factor remaining is the labor-cheap labor that can be bought for about 30 a day . Loinclothed natives do most of the work . They slit the rubber tree 's bark , gather the soft flowing latex , load it into tank cars . This type of worker has no pride in his job , nor does he become devoted to the boss directly over him . Yet last week perhaps a few of the natives working on some 46,000 acres of Goodyear Rubber Plantation Co. ' s Sumatran rubber land heard of a change in bosses , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of Goodyear Tire &; Rubber Co. has definitely passed to the Cyrus Stephen Eaton-Otis &; Co. interests . <P> Mr. Eaton 's journey from the herring-savored village of Pugwash , Nova Scotia , to remote control of thousands of natives in Sumatra has been indeed a strange passage . Yet upon him it has left none of the travel marks that are found on most tycoons who have made similar trips from nowhere to the inner circle . He has none of the restlessness of a Ulysses , such as drove the late great Thomas Fortune Ryan from enterprise to enterprise . Nor has he the swagger of a Magellan , such as is found in Motormaker Chrysler . <P> Most important of the many milestones along the obscure Eaton route was 1905. , when he graduated from McMaster 's University ( Toronto ) and descended upon the U. S. , settling in Cleveland . In this first excursion there was , however , no quest for a golden fleece . Mr. Eaton 's sole purpose in coming to Cleveland was to join an uncle , Dr. Charles Aubrey Eaton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself was never ordained . <P> Just what extra-curriculum activities engaged Mr. Eaton during the ensuing period is not clear . But something must have kept him busy , for when during the panic of 1907 a member of the congregation made a proposition , he was able to secure some stray public utilities in Iowa . No slow-growing oaks sprang from these little acorns . Within eight years he was estimated to control $2,000,000,000 of invested money in Mid-West gas , power , light and traction companies . Now he is one of the foremost U. S. utility men , has been especially active in developing the United Power &; Light Co . <P> To account for this rapid expansion , Eatonists give credit to neither stock manipulations nor managerial ability . His special genius is in organization . Speaking in exact , ministerial tones , casting penetrating looks from his blue eyes , he wields great power when it comes to exhorting ancient industrial rivals to quell their jealousies and lock their arms in Christian fashion before fighting the fight for bigger profits .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
