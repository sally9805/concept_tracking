At 5 p. m. last Friday the 48 office workers of L. L. Coryell &; Son in Lincoln , Neb. pulled out their desk drawers , emptied them , packed typewriters , files and work-in-progress into large cardboard boxes on which their names were neatly stamped . The boxes were boosted into a moving van which rumbled out of town that evening . In the 6 a. m. quiet of Saturday morning the Coryell staff reassembled with their families , piled into 13 automobiles festooned with banners and wound off in a honking caravan toward Colorado Springs , 600 mi. away . A cameraman hired by L. L. Coryell &; Son stood beside the road to film the spectacle -a whole business going away for the summer . <P> When the vacationists arrived in Colorado Springs they found desks and telephones installed in the high-school gymnasium . Before bedtime Sunday night the gym had been converted into a business office . Coryell workers and their families then retired to houses or apartments rented for them by the company . Bright &; early Monday morning work began . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 486 cut-rate filling stations in about 400 towns and cities in 14 Midwest States . Its highly efficient exodus may have seemed remarkable to Colorado Springs , but in Lincoln people have learned to expect almost anything from a management whose self-advertising is continuous and unique . For 36 years Nebraskans have lacked no reminders of the beautiful friendship between Levi Leland Coryell Sr. and Levi Leland Coryell Jr. , who are respectively president and general manager of the company . It started soon after the company did , in Auburn , Neb. when Junior Coryell was born . Father Coryell built a play pen in his office and took Junior to work . Every two hours he carried him home for feeding and a change . When Junior started to school , Father Coryell moved his office ten blocks to be nearby so Junior could drop in at recess and lunch periods . When Junior graduated from high school he was made a full partner in the business and given Checkbook No. 3 against the Coryell family account . Father Coryell and he then took a correspondence school course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six years later , after they had moved to Lincoln , that Father &; Son Coryell began to dress like twins . Somewhat tentative at first , this custom speedily became systematic with the Coryells . When one buys a suit the other goes along and gets an identical one . Neither ever buys a necktie , a shirt or a pair of socks without taking a duplicate home . The Coryell taste runs to costumes of some audacity and each ensemble is numbered to save time in the morning . Whichever Coryell wakes up first telephones the other and says , " I 'm wearing the 23 suit , 16 tie , 11 shoes , " as the case may be . Close friends of the Coryells have never known them to disagree on anything . When Junior married there was speculation in Lincoln as to how his wife would enter into the spirit of the thing . Mrs. Coryell Jr . approves the family arrangement entirely , but she and Mrs. Coryell Sr. have never taken up dressing alike .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
