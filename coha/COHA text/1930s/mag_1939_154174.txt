On the second day of the new year taps were sounded this week for the 1938 college football season . While 215,000 fans watched the ceremonies in New Orleans , Miami , Pasadena and Dallas , millions of stay-at-homes , by their radios , followed events in the Sugar Bowl , Orange Bowl , Rose Bowl , Cotton Bowl . <P> In New Orleans ' Sugar Bowl , undefeated , untied Texas Christian , generally considered the No. 1 football team of 1938 , pitted its famed passing attack against the aggressive line play of once-defeated ( by Notre Dame ) Carnegie Tech . At half-time it looked as if Texas Christian 's little Davey O'Brien , most sensational footballer of the year ( he completed 93 out of 167 passes ) , might become the disappointment of the finale . The Scoreboard read Carnegie Tech 7 , Texas Christian 6- because little Davey had failed to kick the extra point . But in the second half , Quarterback O'Brien resumed his role of hero , led his team to another touchdown and kicked a last-quarter field goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but stamped it as one of the greatest football teams of the decade . <P> In Miami 's Orange Bowl , under a hot sun , an undefeated , untied Tennessee team , which most experts rate second to Texas Christian , showed that it deserved its reputation by drubbing a praiseworthy Oklahoma eleven , undefeated Big Six champions , 17-to-0 . <P> In Pasadena 's Rose Bowl , in an off- &-on; drizzle , a powerful , versatile Southern California team which had given Notre Dame its only defeat of the season , tried desperately to gain the distinction of being the first eleven to cross the goal line of the 1938 Duke team . Though they outrushed the Easterners by 135 yards to 86 , outpassed them by 84 yards to 53 , not until the final minute did they succeed . Then with four magnificent forward passes , as dramatic as a Hollywood scenario , the Pacific Coast champions smudged Duke 's clean slate , 7-to-3 . <P> In Dallas ' Cotton Bowl , twice-defeated St. Mary 's ( of California ) handed ambitious Texas Tech ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) after ten victories in a row .
