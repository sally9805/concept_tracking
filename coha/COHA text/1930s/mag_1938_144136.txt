Cuban police swept over the island last week with a blanket order to round up radicals , " detained " hundreds , for several days . With this as a prelude , Cuba 's dominant army " strong man , " squat , swarthy Colonel Fulgencio Batista held elections to fill 81 seats in the House , one in the Senate . <P> When Cuba revived constitutional government in 1936 , after a three-year lapse , the constitution provided that half the lower chamber be renewed every two years . Some months ago the members drew lots to determine those who would serve the short two-year term and at last week 's balloting a majority of the unlucky holders were up for reelection . All the candidates , although they represented seven parties , were pledged to Batista and his Three-Year Plan . Cuban voters were so apathetic that less than 30% of the electorate went to the polls . <P> For the first time in Cuban history military men watched over the polling places . Boastfully proud of his army and contemptuous of Cuban politicians , Batista @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the republic 's history . " Cuba 's much-bossed President , Federico Laredo Bru , who has long been expected to announce his resignation after this election , kept mum last week about himself , but made a possibly ironic speech of " thanks " to citizens of Santiago for their " demonstrative " greeting to his " representative , " Batista , on the occasion of a grand fiesta celebrating the 43rd anniversary of the beginning of Cuba 's struggle for independence .
