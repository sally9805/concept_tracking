Blanton 's Marks Sirs : <P> It has been rumored that Red-baiting Congressman Tom Blanton of Texas has a secretary whose name is Marx . Could this rumor be verified ? <P> RICHARD M. SCAMMON <P> Minneapolis , Minn . <P> Texas ' Blanton has on his payroll one Ruby S. Whipke , who in private life is Mrs. George S. Marks , not Marx . Mrs.Marks will not be on the Blanton Congressional payroll after Jan. 3 because the Democratic Congressman was defeated for renomination last fortnight . - ED . <P> Finest for Andrews <P> Sirs : <P> YOUR CURRENT ISSUE TIME , Aug. 24 CONTAINING STATEMENT THAT PENURIOUS YANKEES AND SHIFTLESS MALARIAL CRACKERS TO WHOM YOU ATTRIBUTE MY SUCCESSFUL NOMINATION TO U. S. SENATE IS STRIKINGLY UNFAIR TO ME AND AN INSULT TO NOT ONLY EVERY NATIVE OF FLORIDA BUT A HOST OF FLORIDA 'S BEST CITIZENS FROM NORTHERN STATES WHO CHOSE TO MAKE THEIR HOME HERE . IT IS CONCEDED HERE THAT MY JUDICIAL LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE RECORD OF 25 YEARS AND MY CO-OPERATION WITH THE CITRUS INDUSTRY AND CONSISTENT ADHERENCE TO DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IN FLORIDA MAINLY CAUSED MY ELECTION . FLORIDA HAS BEEN HONORED IN BEING SELECTED AS THE HOME OF MANY SPLENDID MEN AND WOMEN FROM NORTHERN STATES WHOM YOU DUB PENURIOUS YANKEES BUT WHOM WE KNOW TO BE AMONG THE FINEST AMERICAN CITIZENS . <P> C. O. Andrews <P> Orlando Fla . <P> Sirs : Your article ( TIME , Aug. 24 ) on Florida 's Pension Senator struck me as an excellent analyzation of the situation here . Doubtlessly , Judge Andrews will dispute the implication that Townsend votes were responsible for his election . <P> If they were not , why did he endorse the Townsend plan ? Surely a man of Judge Andrews ' intelligence and training could not sincerely believe in this farcical cureall . <P> MAX BUCK <P> Apopka , Fla . <P> Wahoo Wahoo 's Associate <P> Sirs : <P> Until recent publication of your fascinating " Dodo " articles I credited your magazine with average honest reporting . I now can pity the unfortunate individual who is not gifted with a sense of humor . I managed to get a good laugh , which might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in spite of the fact that there are not two accurate sentences in your entire first five paragraphs as published in TIME , Aug. 24 , entitled " Dodo 's Price . " <P> I have only two direct comments to make . First , where do you get that drinking stuff ? I drink no more than the average politician and a damn sight less than many newshawks , as you call them . You are at liberty to search my official Naval record , and perform such other spy work as the investigation will require in regard to this matter . There is nothing whatever in the record , on and off , to justify the politely sordid comments you make concerning liquor , and myself . For your information , I am suffering from acute neuritis in my legs which followed a severe case of double lobar pneumonia ( unconscious five days and not expected to live ) , which in turn followed an attack of acute gastritis with hemorrhages ( unconscious two or three days ) . Is it possible you confuse neuritis with alcoholic jitters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writer of such a glittering article .
