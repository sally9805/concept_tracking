While Europe with shaking knees found itself last week on the brink of war ( see p. 17 ) , and foreign statesmen hoped that a firm U. S. attitude would help avert it , President Roosevelt performed change of face as sudden , though perhaps not as effective , as that which upset the World Monetary &; Economic Conference in 1933 . Apparently fearing that his and Secretary Hull 's recent , repeated condemnations of autarchies and aggressors too definitely aligned the U. S. with England and France if Germany provoked a war , Mr. Roosevelt suddenly lashed out at " some " U. S. editors and columnists . He said their interpretations were politically warped , entirely wrong . <P> Specifically he cited a report that Ambassador Bullitt had said fortnight ago in Bordeaux , France , that the U. S. stands with France " in war as in peace . " Mr. Bullitt denied saying that , said the President . Mr. Roosevelt told the press to reread his and Secretary Hull 's recent utterances . Next day Mr. Hull made public a letter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Lima , December ) , saying : <P> " The nations of the world are faced with the issue of determining whether relations shall be characterized by international anarchy and lawlessness or by principles of fair play , justice and order under law . No nation and no government can avoid the issue ; neither can any nation avoid participation , willing or not , in the responsibility of determining which course of action shall prevail . " <P> Putting Mr. Roosevelt 's and Mr. Hull 's remarks together , observers could only conclude : 1 ) that the U. S. is indeed morally aligned against Germany ; 2 ) that President Roosevelt , again putting domestic issues above international problems , is anxious to keep opponents from charging in this fall 's campaign that the Administration is heading the U. S. toward war . <P> As far as Roosevelts were concerned , man-of-last-week was a 36-year-old surgeon at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester . Minn. - Dr . Howard Kramer ( " Howdie " ) Gray , son of Vice Chairman Carl Gray of the Union Pacific R. R. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 1937 ( TIME . May 3 , 1937 ) . Perennial president of his Princeton class ( 1923 ) , as famed in college for his unobtrusive Christianity as for his athletic ability ( varsity football end ) , this model son of model parents is recognized by the Doctors Mayo as their crack stomach surgeon . Because Son James Roosevelt 's stomach ulcer failed to respond to rest and diet last summer ( TIME , Aug. 22 ) he returned to the clinic last week . " Howdie " Gray was named to operate . President Roosevelt called for his special train and sped westward . After talking with the President . Dr. Gray moved the operation ahead 24 hours .
