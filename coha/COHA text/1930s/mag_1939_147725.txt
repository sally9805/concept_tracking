Captain Harry George Armstrong , a salty ex-Marine doctor , is director of the Army 's efficient Aero-Medical Research Laboratory at Wright Field , Dayton , Ohio . Ten years ago Dr. Armstrong made his first parachute jump from an altitude of 2,200 feet , then published a cold , detailed medical report on his " free fall in space . " <P> " The period of free fall , " he wrote , " was remarkably free from abnormal physical sensations . . . . Consciousness was unclouded , and ideation thought was rapid , precise , penetrating and clear . " <P> Last week Dr. Armstrong officially opened a new branch of medical science with a weighty tome , Aviation Medicine <P> ( Williams &; Wilkins , $6.50 ) , first book of its kind to appear in 13 years . Crammed with technical advice to physicians , pilots , passengers , airlines , the Army , the aviation industry , the book is especially significant for its lengthy discussions of aviators ' diseases . <P> Ears and Stomach . " Pilots suffer more frequently from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all other occupational diseases combined . " Conditions of flight damaging the ear : 1 ) " changes of atmospheric pressure during ascent and descent " ; 2 ) harsh , monotonous propeller and exhaust noises , which airplane manufacturers are unable to muffle . A common aeronautical affliction is " aero-otitis media . " This is a " chronic inflammation of the middle ear caused by a pressure difference between the air in the ear cavity and that of the surrounding atmosphere . It ... occurs during changes of altitude , " starts as a " hissing , roaring , crackling , or snapping , " soon leads to warm pain and vertigo , often deafness . Yawning , shouting or singing may help to equalize the pressure . Treatment is the same as for ordinary earache : dry heat and a cotton plug . <P> Droning noises may not only destroy the auditory nerve , but also reduce the flow of saliva and gastric juices . Noise , fear , and changing atmospheric pressure ( lowered pressure expands intestinal gases , may cause violent cramps ) all add up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gastric disturbances . "
