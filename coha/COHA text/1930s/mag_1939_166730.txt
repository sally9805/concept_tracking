Reinhold A. Faust , 74 , of No. 2517 North Richmond Street , Chicago , last week told where he was on the night of Nov. 16 , 1917 . He was at the opera , hearing Galli-Curci sing in Dinorah* in Chicago 's Auditorium Theatre . Midway through the first act , Galli-Curci left the dim-lit stage . Reinhold Faust left his seat in Row K , four off the aisle . A woman saw flame , and screamed . Chicago Fireman ( now Fire Commissioner ) Michael J. Corrigan grabbed a bomb , yanked out its phosphorescent fuse , rushed outside before it could spray buckshot among the 2,200 people present . The perpetrator was not discovered . <P> The following week Chicago 's late Banker James B. Forgan received a note demanding $100,000 , on pain of being bombed . Police arrested Reinhold Faust and convicted him of attempted extortion . <P> " I remember now , " Reinhold Faust explained last week . " The rich man question was up at that time . I was fanatic enough to do that thing . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a peaceful old man now . " <P> Reinhold Faust was a peaceful old man last week , but for over 21 years he had had no peace . When he was taken to Joliet Penitentiary to serve 14 months for threatening Banker Forgan , he was in a predicament . In Box No. 198 in the vaults of Chicago 's National Safety Deposit Co. he had four black powder gaspipe bombs . He solved his problem momentarily by throwing away the safe deposit key . <P> Then a new problem arose . Unless he paid the safe deposit rent regularly , the company would open the box and find the bombs . Having no key , he could not remove them in secret . The price of safety was $10 box rent annually . So for 21 years he paid blackmail to the devil in cash . Even so his secret was not safe . This winter the safe deposit company decided to move . He could do nothing . So finally Reinhold Faust 's box was duly opened . Having heard this story , Municipal Court Judge Matthew D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as romantically reported last week .
