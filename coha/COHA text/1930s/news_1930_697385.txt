txt District Attorney Crain was requested yesterday by Special Prosecutor Hiram C. Todd to appear before the extraordinary grand jury today to relate the details of the investigation he conducted into the Ewald-Healy case before the New York County grand jury which failed to vote indictments . Mr. Todd did not explain the purpose of calling Mr. Crane , who was superseded by Attorney General Hamilton Ward in the graft investigation growing out of the charge that George F. Ewald , a former city magistrate , paid Martin -J . Healy , a Tammany leader , $10,000 for his appointment in 1927 . It was understood , however , that the special prosecutor , through an examination of Mr. Crain and four Criminal Court stenographers who have been subpoenaed , hopes to lay . before the grand jury the testimony which Heary , Ewald , his wife , Mrs. Bertha E. Ewald , and Thomas T. Tommaney gave in the first inquiry and now are unwilling to repeat . Mrs. Ewald Balks at Waiver . Mr. Todd is anxious that the grand jury , which is expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days before entering upon a broader inquiry , have an opportunity to weigh the plausibility of the explanation given by the four principals regarding the financial transaction that accompanied Ewald 's appointment . All four told the county grand jury that the $10 , - 000 which Tommaney took to Healy from Mrs. Ewald was a non-interest bearing unsecured loan : Mrs. Ewald , who refused yesterday to waive immunity and thus was barred as a witness , admitted before the county grand jury that she had lost the note which she said Healy gave her . She was the third to balk at a waiver and her attorney , I. Nicholas Gordon , explained that she had acted upon his advice because he did not wish her to be " cross-examined on testimony she gave before the county grand jury . " Her husband and Healy declined waivers Wednesday , and Tommaney , who is first on the list of today 's witnesses , is expected to follow the same course . The witness room in Supreme Court had the air of an anteroom in Tammany Hall at times during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keating of the Thirteenth and City Clerk Michael Cruise of the Twelfth , sat around chatting with Tommaney , former chief clerk in Sheriff Thomas Farley 's office , and waiting to be called , The Sheriff dropped in himself for a moment , and through a mistake in dates Mayor Walker walked over from City . Hall and stayed long enough to be photographed with his bodyguard . Mr. Keating and Mr. Cruise both waived immunity and testified briefly before the grand jury . The city clerk , it was understood , identified records showing that Ewald , Torn- maney and Healy , until recently a deputy commissioner of the Department of Plant and Structures , all took oaths of office when they were appointed . Whether he was asked concerning any other matters could not be learned . Mr. Keating , from whose office the late Magistrate Andrew Macrery was taken to die supposedly of heart disease in a doctor 's office , would not discuss his testimony . Last week , declaring he was tired of rumors and insinuations relative to Magistrate Macrery 's death , Mr. Keating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petitioning the court , through District Attorney Crain 's office , for permission to exhume the ' body for an autopsy . Former Sheriff Charles W. Culkin , leader of the Third Assembly District , was another prominent Tam ' manyite under grand jury subpoena , but his name was not reached before the investigating body adjourned until 10 o'clock this morning . Although Mr. Todd asserted that Mr. Culkin would be required to waive immunity the same as all the other politicians thus far summoned , he would not reveal what connection , if any , the former sheriff has with the Ewald case . Felix Solomon Sumnioned . . Process servers for the Attorney General 's office have succeeded in serving a subpoena upon Fen* . Solomon , treasurer of the Cayuga Realty Company , for whom . United States Marshals have been searching since Aug. 1 with a Federal grand jury subpoena , it became known during the day . Mr. Solomon was served outside 2 Lafayette , where the realty company , one of Healy 's private business enterprises , had offices . The subpoena called for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , that Mr. Solomon probably would not be called today . Mr. Solomon , when told of the search that had been made for him , declared he had not been out of New York City for more than ten days and then , he said , he was at Asbury Park , where he saw " everybody in the world on the boardwalk . " He said he did not know what books or records the Attorney General 's office wanted and was n't sure he could produce any . Four of the seven witnesses examined yesterday by the grand jury were continuing testimony begun on Wednesday . They were Maurice Rogen , Robert Erskine and H. Black , employes in banks where the principals in the case had accounts , and Peter Eckert , Mrs. Ewald 's father , who lent her $5,000 of the $10,000 she gave to Healy . When Mr. Eckert emerged from the grand jury room he was mopping his forehead . Most of the questions he had answered , he said , had to do with the loan he had made to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion picture enterprise . Speaking to reporters , he said : " I gave my daughter the money so she could buy a house for all of us to live in . I did n't care what she did with it . She 's a pretty smart woman . She was n't born yesterday and if she lent the money to get on the right side of an influential man I guess she knew what she was , about . " Mr. Eckert , who said he lived " with the judge " and then corrected himself and said , " I mean the former judge , " declared there could not ' have been " anything legally wrong with the transaction , because if- there had been Healy would have refused a check and insisted upon cash . " He 's pretty smart , too , " he added . Ewald Indictment Upheld : , ' Two moves were made in Federal coUrt in connection with the HealyEwald case . Judge Kennedy denied a ? motion to quash the indictment of the former magistrate for mail fraud in- connection with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nicholas Gordon , attorney for the Ewalds , then asked for an " immediate trial , " declaring that his witnesses were " through with the extraordinary grand jury . " Judge Kennedy asked how long the trial would take and Alvin . Sylvester , an assistant United States Attorney , replied that it " probably will last about six weeks . " The case is on the calendar for ' Monday , but it probably will be adjourned andther week . Shortly afterward Federal Judge Simon Adler granted a motion by Mr. Sylvester to permit Attorney General Ward or his representative to inspect the minutes of the grand jury which returned the mail fraud indictment . The motion was accompanied by an affidavit from Mr. Ward stating that it was essential for him to compare the testimony of witnesses before the ? Federal grand jury with testimony they have given or will give in the inquiry by the- extraordinary grand jury . The witnesses whose names appear on the record in the mail fraud case are Harry C. Cotter , former president of the mining company ; Ewald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis M. Schirp , Frank E. Mitterlechner and Frank M. Bins , all co-defendants of the former magistrate . Others are Emmerich Boczor . Dr. J. G. William Greeff , Commissioner of Hospitals ; Mary Gudat , in whose name Ewald carried a bank account , and Healy , who is under Federal indictment for failure to file an income tax return in 1927 , the year in which Ewald was appoined a magistrate . Of these Ewald and Healy have been eliminated as witnesses . Boczor , a former confidential secretary to the ex-magistrate and now his chief accuser , has told his story to the special grand jury . Dr. Francis Schirp , who , according to Boczor , received $2,000 from Ewald for joining with Victor Ridder and John J. Meyers , Steuben Society members , in endorsing his appointment , has been subpoenaed , but has not yet testified . The grand jury , according to Mr. Todd , probably will not desire to examine Mayor Walker and George W. Olvany , former leader of Tammany Hall until next week . It was through a misunderstanding that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was said . A messenger had been dispatched to City- Hall to tell Mr. Walker his presence was not needed , but the Mayor was on his way before the messenger arrived .
