S UPPOSE poverty was not abolished , as we imag- fined . The idea that we had done it , or were doing it , was new . Even in prosperity it was new , and that by itself would be something to remember . But , in fact , there is much more . We are looking at it without seeing it . We are looking through it . Before you can abolish poverty , you have to abolish the feeling of poverty , and that we have done . It is what we do not see because our eyes are out of focus . Almost unawares we have done it , and yet it is of tremendous import . Moreover , we can not be mistaken , since the proof appears under conditions of extreme trial  --  namely , in the slough of depression . Only ask the question , how this depression , in its social aspect , differs from any comparable depression of the past , and it will begin at once to appear . Hitherto , the condition of joblessness was an individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of society as a whole . Hitherto , poverty , the extreme and haggard accentuation of it , was the first aspect of depression , and the reaction of society was a call to charity . Now suddenly the word " charity " is forbidden . We speak instead of relief , and the idea underlying all forms of relief , private and public both , is that there shall be no sense of charity in it , no more on the part of those who receive it than on the part of those who provide it . The unemployed do not want charity ; they resent it themselves and it is resented for them . Unemployment relief is not administered in a spirit of charity . Why ? Because charity belongs to a feeling of poverty , and we have abolished that feeling . Formerly , in any depression comparable to this one , the conscience of society was content to meet only the raw need of hunger by means of spontaneous charity . Soup kitchens , bread lines , community rations  --  enough of these and somehow we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest that merely to appease hunger is the whole obligation of society to its unemployed . Speaking before a committee of the United States Senate on a bill to provide more direct unemployment relief out of the national funds , in January , Mr. H. L. Lurie , representing the American Association of Social Workers and the New York Bureau of Jewish Social Research , said : " It is becoming increasingly true that the efforts of relief agencies do not go much beyond the objective of seeing that nobody shall starve . " Not many years ago it would have been difficult to make sense of a statement like that , for to see that nobody should starve would have been thought the whole objective . If You Must Give in the Streets ? D URING three years of depression , necessities have increased in a progressive manner . Expend .. itures of all kinds for relief have more than doubled each year . From approximately $200,000,000 in the first year they may run as high as $1,000,000,000 in the fourth year . This is explained not simply by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human pressure upon the sources of public relief , once they are opened . With no actual increase of unemployment in the third or fourth year and no shameless exploitation of public relief by the chronically indigent and their demagogues , still the necessity would rise , and for the reason that as the depression drags on , the unemployed gradually consume their savings , their private means , all their resources of credit and self-help , at last to the very end , and are then obliged to seek relief . Yet notwithstanding this dire increase of necessity , the outward spectacle of poverty has in a relative sense diminished . Soup kitchens and bread lines have not multiplied in the same ratio . They are too humiliating , both to society and to those whom they bitterly serve . Relief in its right character is so organized that it goes to the home ; it regards the family , and regards it not as an empty stomach but as a social unit to be conserved . A proud , self-respecting city does not want soup kitchens and bread lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Begging in the city streets is not forbidden ; one who does it will not be arrested . But giving in the streets is inhibited by suggestion from the organized relief agencies and by editorials in the newspapers , saying it is hateful and even cruel to give in that way , because it is charity . Give instead to the nearest relief agency . " Brother , can you spare a dime ? " belongs to balladry . The solicitation is almost certainly professional . There is a place for everybody to sleep and there is something for everybody to eat  --  or , at least , it should be so , and it will be so , if you will give what you can give to organized relief , not in a spirit of charity at all but with a sense of social duty . A Catholic society in New York says , if you must give in the streets , do it for your own sake and look not to whom you give . To warm your private heart by an impulsive act of charity may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your duty as a citizen is to support the principle of organized relief . TT IS no longer enough to feed the unemployed . It 1 is no longer enough to house and clothe them . Their morale must be upheld . Their social assets must be preserved . And by no means in a spirit of charity . They are entitled to relief in that measure . If they do not receive it , the loss is not theirs alone , not theirs primarily ; it is the loss of society regarding itself as a whole . Chronic poverty as a social and national disgrace . Episodic poverty as a public responsibility . How far we have come from that age-long feeling wherein it was written , " The poor we have always with us . " Dr.SidneyGoldstein , executive chairman of the Joint Unemployment Committee , a body represent-big fifteen organizations dealing with the problems of unemployment , was speaking before a Senate committee for-Federal relief . He said : " These men and women , I think we ought to understand , are entitled not to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they live . They are citizens of the United States and they are entitled to be maintained by the Government , in view of the fact that the primary function of the Government is to protect its citizens , not only against the danger of war but against the danger of disease , the danger of starvation and the danger of premature death . That to us , Mr. Chairman , is one of the primary functions of the Government of the United States . " That people are entitled to a way of living above poverty , and entitled to receive it from the society to which they belong when they can not provide it for themselves , is not merely a new idea , a new way of thinking and feeling . It is something society is doing . Not American society alone , but American society with now more zeal than any other . Here in  --  this country first appeared the thought that poverty could he abolished , and here , too , a phrase that has become current in Europe with many unexpected political and economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living . " The League of Nations says : The widespread acceptance of the notion of " standards of living , " and the associated conception of a " minimum standard " which society should in some way guarantee to every normal individual , is one of the most remarkable social developments of recent years . Trade unionists and social reformers have fought for this conception for many decades , but its acceptance has been numb more general in the postwar period , The contractual idea which it embodies is of profound importance and marks a distinct departure from theories of individual enterprise and free competition . It establishes in economic organization a new social right , comparable in many ways with property rights . ( World Economic Sweep , 1931-32 , p. 223 . ) Once the principle of a minimum standard of decent living is established , it follows that there shall be an idea of a minimum standard of public relief for such as fall below that minimum standard of living . It follows also that as the standards of living rise , so will the standards of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Social Agencies D llRING the year : : or prosperity that preceded this depression there was an extraordinary extension of professional social work in the whole country . Social agencies multiplied very fast , grew rich and powerful , even politically powerful in a good sense ; first , they became highly and scientifically organised , then nationally federated . Whether publicly supported out of the tax funds or privately endowed , whether created by legislation or by philanthropy acting through foundations , they were all united by zeal , by emotion and by motives of emulation ; they held national conferences to compare ideals and progress , and evolved a common social philosophy . Finally , as one great achievement , they overthrew the thought of charity toward dependent people . ( Continued on Page 867 In place of doles of charity just enough to postpone a dependent family 's misery from week to week . they set up ideal standards of relief on a formal budget basis . Not the stark necessities of a dependent family for food , clothing and shelter , but what a family should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members , in order to keep its health and morale and enjoy a minimum of decent living in a certain environment  --  that was the standard , and the items thereof were cast in budgets scientifically estimated . For a Type A dependent family a Type A budget , for a Type B family a Type B budget , and so on . The Wider Meaning of Relief In the Report of the President 's Research Committee on Recent Social Trends in the United States , published last January , there is a chapter on Social Work , and under the head of Advancing Standards of Relief , the following : Standards of relief have been raised , both through the application of the budget idea  --  finding out the actual cost of the things a family requires  --  and through the acceptance of additional items as part of a decency minimum . Until the recent depression , there seemed to be a tendency for the budget to move always upward ; this movement was so pronounced that questions were raised as to what upper limit must be put on budgets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for nondependent families . . . . By 1925 , the budget for dependent families might contain not only items for rent , food , clothing , fuel , light and household expenses , but church and lodge dues , recreation , health , insurance , carfare and miscellaneous items . The attitude of some family-welfare agencies has also changed in regard to the amount of savings and property which an applicant for relief may have . Aid is sometimes given in holding insurance or equity in a home . Each city had its own standard , fixed by its public-welfare organization , and then in every large city there were private organizations , each with a separate standard , so that there was , entendre of which is , unfortunately , not double but single , An.d if you soy anything to them , they lake umbrage , And later , when you are emptying the ash trays before going to bed , you find them under the sofa , where they have crept for a good night 's slumbrage .

They say , " Come to supper Sunday night ; do n't dress , " so you arrive not dressed And you find a dinner of thirty-two and yourself the only informally clad guest . ( Continued from Page 151 of course , much variation ; but all standards were competitive , the higher ones giving shame to the lower ones , with the result in general that the standards of relief rose faster than the standards of common independent living . In Chicago , where it was obvious that the standard of relief had been rising faster than the standard of living , an investigation was made in 1927 to determine whether dependent families were not actually living better at the hands of the social agencies than independent families were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was proved by a study of 467 families of unskilled , fully employed wage earners that two-thirds of them were unable to live on their wages as well as dependent families were living on public and private relief money . The social workers were not in the least embarrassed by this comparison . They defended their standards , saying all that had been proved was that wages were too low to provide a minimum of decent living , and economic society ought to be ashamed of itself . In Philadelphia , the Jewish Welfare Society held to the highest relief standard , which was $21.75 a week as the irreducible minimum for a family of five , itemized in the relief budget thus : For food , $9.25 ; for rent , $5.70 ; for clothing , $2.92 ; for lunches , GO cents ; for light and cooking , 69 cents ; for household supplies , 35 cents ; for carfares , 90 cents ; for incidentals , 64 cents , and , in July , for ice , 70 cents . In The Compass , official organ of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a review of social work , past , present and future , written by the president , who said : In social work as an industry the period between the end of the war and 1929 was one of expansion . . .

And then , on this expanded industry , taking its boom too much for They borrow and promise to lake good care of your really , really first edition of Ulysses , And later report that they 're sorry , but it was thrown in the furnace by their right-minded Mrs. And then you are presented with a lot of form-filling apologies Quite good eno ugh , I am sure , for inclusion in one of the higher-class anthologies .

Ogden Nash . granted , like every other industry , suddenly , in 1930 , the depression fell . For a moment the industry thought its standards , its ideals , its budget system , its technic and all , would be swallowed up in one great tide of emergency relief , irrationally administered . Relief in its permanent social meaning would be submerged . Moreover , the inclosures of social science , all those de-marked and orderly fields of public welfare , becoming of a sudden one chaotic field of social distress , would be invaded by temporary and hastily conceived organizations , led by well-meaning but inexperienced and untrained people with enormous sums of public and private money to dispense among the unemployed . The Compass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an epidemic , everyone turns doctor and nurse for the emergency . In the depression , private social agencies have recruited to their staffs every available person with a semblance of training . . . . New personnel has been added , selected when possible from among those qualified for training . In the emergency-relief organizations , however , a new group of participants in the administration of relief has been added by numbers  --  hundreds in the larger cities  --  of persons recruited from nothing more nearly related to social work than the so-called white-collar occupations and first admitted to the group on the basis of their own need . In public work , in spite of generous lending of staffs by private agencies , the safeguards of civil service with qualifications for admission have been overridden by the emergency . Amateur ? ides  --  de-Camp All that was feared by the social workers did rudely happen , to their great dismay , and yet the consequences were such as they could very easily welcome . Temporary and hastily conceived relief organizations were set up ; untrained and inexperienced people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , were appointed to dispense great sums // Or private and publii. money as unemployment relief . That was all very well . But when it came to the last problem of all , winch was how to get relief money into the hands of those who most deserved it , these distinguished amateurs realized that whereas charity is simple , mass relief is quite another thing and very difficult to handle . They knew nothing about it . In New York City , for example , almost overnight , sixty-nine public relief bureaus were established , with an emergency personnel of 2000 people , and relief money in hand to he distributed at the rate of $2,000,000 or $.3,000,000 a week . But imagine a. city simply holding its purse open to all corners ! The last to he helped would probably be the truly deserving , if ever they got helped at all . This emergency personnel , of course , did not know the first principles of the social worker 's technic . They did not know what to ask those who applied for relief , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers . The New Technic of Relief In such a dilemma it was necessary to call in the trained social workers . The private social agencies supplied them . They knew how to interrogate and investigate the applicants , and how deftly to make them disclose their private resources ; they could distinguish almost at once between the feigned and unfeigned sound of distress . Those whose approach to emergency relief had been emotional were at first scandalized by the impersonal and cold formalities of the social workers . " This is relief , " they kept saying ? " emergency relief . These people want food and you make them touch ice . " But the social workers knew what they were doing . In a little while it appeared that they made very few mistakes and that they were true defenders of the relief fund . It was not that they cared for the fund itself or wished to keep down the cost of relief . Not that . It was only that they were anxious to make what there was go as far as possible among the truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hastily conceived organizations , would have been helpless without them . Thus it was that in all the large cities the effective administration of emergency unemployment relief came to rest very heavily  --  almost entirely  --  upon those highly organized and nationally federated social agencies that had evolved the technic of mass relief to the point of science  --  or , that is to say , upon the professional industry of social work , with its body of trained personnel , numbering , to begin with , more than 30,000 in the country , and now increasing very fast as the demand rises . The authority and prestige of the profession have been everywhere extended . Its voice is authentic because there is no other that can pretend to be ; its statements of current fact touching human distress , local , regional and national , are accepted because there is nowhere else any comparable body of facts . The Federal Government itself is unable to say what conditions are at a given time , even intelligently to estimate the aggregate necessities , except in collaboration with those private and federated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information , all the way up from the case work on the ground to the generalized statistical view . Keeping this in mind , and looking then at what the united leaders of the social-work industry are fighting for , one will be able somewhat to understand a certain deep note of controversy running through all the liters , - ture and discussion of emergency relief from the beginning . The social workers are fighting to extend their industry and to uphold their high standards of relief , naturally . But these standards at their highest were by no means the goal they were aiming at before . They do not believe in relief , really . It is better than charity , and represents , therefore , an important advance . But as they overthrew the thought of charity with the idea of relief , so they would overthrow the thought of relief with a more advanced idea still . They would implant in the mind of society a sense of unlimited responsibility for the welfare , happiness and living of the individual . For relief they would substitute social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , motherhood and widowhood insurance , economic-disability insurance , and , of course , unemployment insurance  --  so that , whatever happens , the individual , or , it may be said , the family , shall he guaranteed a minimum of decent living , a higher and higher minimum , and receive it from society  --  that is to say , from the state  --  not as relief but as a definite right . And so it is , on the side of the social workers , using the authentic voice , that all discussion of emergency relief is loaded , consciously or otherwise , with a deep feeling for ends beyond . They are continually saying that the funds for emergency relief are tragically inadequate . Sometimes , but not often , they mean the funds are inadequate to provide enough food of the right kind . Generally they mean the funds are inadequate to provide a minimum of decent living , and take enough food for granted . Testifying before a committee of the United States Senate for more and direct Federal relief , in January , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York City , which is a clearing house and cofirdinating body for more than 900 social agencies , said : " One of the unfortunate aspects of the situation in New York City is that while , under the law , it is stipulated that various needs must be met , the fact remains that we have been compelled to expend between 70 and 75 per cent of all funds for food , and most of the remaining 25 per cent to meet housing conditions , mainly rentals . " The Evils of Relief Shopping In the same place , at the same time , Walter West , secretary of the American Association of Social Workers , complained that it was disastrous to the morale of people to have to appear in one line for work , in another for clothing , in another for food , and even then to be without cash for their many minor but very essential other needs . " If there is anything that will make people beggars , " he said , " it is this shopping around to get the quickest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of relief agencies and the administration of them without proper relief standards . There had never been , he said , a broad enough standard . It should include , besides food and clothing , certainly also shelter , heat and light . Before the same Senate committee , at an earlier hearing , Linton B. Swift , executive chairman of the Family Welfare Association of America , told how it was that owing to the emergency and the gross inadequacy of relief funds , family-welfare agencies all over the country had been obliged to cut down the budgets of their dependent families . " I have referred , " he said , " to the fact that the great majority of agencies are striving desperately to retain a nucleus of families with which they shall do a good job , and the fact that for the great bulk of the rest of the cases , relief upon a much less adequate basis was necessary . We have asked these agencies for the budgets on which they base relief . The twenty-seven budgets used as guides in that number of agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based upon a family of five . Comparatively few agencies are able to maintain their standard relief budgets . The item most frequently omitted from budgets is clothing . The increase in clothing centers  --  that is , in the distribution of clothing from community centers and the interest of many community groups in collecting and distributing clothing  --  no doubt accounts for this omission of clothing from the relief given . Money for recreation has been left out by a number of agencies . One society mentions an increased use of community resources as a substitute . Other items agencies eliminate are education , insurance and household supplies . A great many families are receiving nothing at all for household supplies . One agency is no longer giving milk , except to nursing mothers , small children and people who are ill . Omission of rent from budgets is a widespread practice . One agency states that it expects the families to use credit for fuel and light and heat . Another agency paid very little for light during the summer and let the families go without . The agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cookstove . " The world of social workers with one voice demands direct Federal relief on a large scale , beyond the 3300,000,000 delivered in 1932 by the Government to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to be loaned to municipalities on their I 0 U notes for relief purposes ; and this is not for the reason only that Federal appropriations would swell the aggregate relief fund and permit the standards of emergency relief to be raised , but for the reason , besides , that a precedent of direct Government responsibility for unemployment would be thereby established . The national leaders of the social-work industry organized a Social Conference on Federal Action and appointed a steering committee to act upon the legislative mind . Their one best forum has been a United States Senate committee room where hearings have been held on the LaFollette-Costigan bill to provide $500,000,000 out of the Treasury for direct unemployment relief . The Other Side of Federal Aid On the other side  --  if one may speak of sides  --  are all those who would regard emergency relief simply as such , saying the depression will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as others have , disappeared , and when once more we are rid of the wretched business , we shall take new thought for the future . Their minds resist the tendency to use acute human distress as a fulcrum whereby to obtain a powerful leverage for experimental social doctrines . If the social workers think Federal money for direct relief will set a precedent of state responsibility for unemployment these for the same reason oppose direct Federal relief . They do not hold that . relief funds are adequate , but they think a principle of local responsibility is at stake , together with principles very much deeper , touching the soul of American individualism and the free status of people in relation to the state . In the movement for Federal funds they detect , or it may be they only feel , what seems a confusion of thought , and is , perhaps , not that at all but an object in disguise . Before there was any clamor for Federal relief , why , for example , should a United States senator who sympathetically represents the social-work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country , asking whether , in its opinion , the time had not come for the Federal Government to act on unemployment relief ? Why should the municipalities be thus solicited to unload their burdens on the Government ? Or , in the same movement , why should miners he summoned before a committee of Congress to testify whether , in their opinion , it was not time for the Federal Government to come to the relief of the mining communities ? What would a miner 's opinion be worth as to that ? The miners all said , of course , that the time had come ; they described their distress to prove the opinion . One complained that in his community , where there had been no work for two years , there was only bread and soup to eat . The soup had rice and barley in it , but wanted potatoes . But why no potatoes ? Two years of idleness , land all around them , and no potatoes . Nobody asked them that question . The subject was Federal relief . The Soft.Coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The argument for Federal relief , even on the part of the social workers , is that it may be justified on the ground of a great emergency ; but the distress of the soft-coal miners is chronic . It painfully existed before the depression , and is , therefore , neither a simple nor a wholly disingenuous exhibit to put into a plea for emergency relief , provided it is emergency relief only , that is being moved . The trouble in the soft-coal industry is too many miners . The real problem , therefore , is technological unemployment . The social worker would say that makes very little difference , for society must accept responsibility for technological unemployment too . That may be so . Nevertheless , those who are wondering where all this responsibility proposed to be laid upon society might end may very well take the soft-coal situation as a text . Suppose you say the coal industry should be obliged by law to provide a minimum of decent living for the miners it can no longer employ . What will it do ? It will add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereby intensify the first problem , which is that the demand for soft coal is in a relative sense declining , owing to the competition of gas and oil and to the more scientific utilization of the coal itself . If you increase the price of coal , the demand will all the more decline . Then , will you pass a law to say the cost of supporting the unemployed miners shall not be added to the price of coal ? In that case , many coal mines will close . Will you pass a law commanding people to use more coal , even at a higher price , in order to keep the mines open and support the unemployed miners ; or a law to compel the mines to operate at a loss , or a law to pass ownership of the mines to the Government ? The Government , of course , could operate them at a loss and tax people at large to meet the deficit , in order that tens of thousands of obsolete miners may receive from society a minimum of decent living . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not refuse to do for another and then another ; and you go on from there , logically , to a new kind of state that shall somehow absorb all economic and social evil and administer all private welfare . Whether that is any kind of state you would like to live in or not is determined apparently by something you are born with . So also , more or less , maybe , unconsciously , determined your attitude toward what the social workers are purposefully and valiantly fighting for in the confusion of this emergency . Feeling goes so far with them that almost nobody will say the measure of emergency relief is adequate , that the average standard is high enough , that the extent of human misery is not appalling , or that the episode is not a scandal to our economic intelligence . Nevertheless , there will be many to feel that the degree in which emergency relief is inadequate is sometimes exaggerated by the authentic voice of the social worker . There is the standing fact , for example , that through all this depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not fallen ; actually they have risen . The depression , therefore , for all it has cost , appears not to have injured us in a vital manner , and to many this is a matter of some comfort . But at the mention of it , the social workers , instead of taking some credit for it , as very well they might , make exceptions to the national statistics , on the ground of omissions . They bring against them selected statistics of another meaning , and fill the record with innumerable human facts of privation , suffering , want , malnutrition , child hazard , suicide , demoralization and poverty . These facts also are true . But is there not an irreducible number of tragic human facts even in times of grand prosperity ? find So the Roof Still Leaks Admitted that the fair face of a statistical table may conceal much misery in the blood of its averages , still it is a fact that the city of New York , taking it alone , went into the fourth year of depression with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history . Prior to 1932 , the best year for health had been 1927 . The death rate in 1027 was 10.71 per thousand of the population ; in 1932 it was 10.3 . The infant-mortality rate in 1927 was 56 per 1000 births ; in 1932 it was less than 51 . The death rate from pneumonia and tuberculosis , which would he associated with exposure , bad housing and malnutrition , was nearly 16 per cent less in 1932 than in 1931 . Say it is nothing to be proud of . Considering what our resources are and how much surplus fat there was , it would be little enough to keep the total body in a state of health . Say there is nothing in our handling of the emergency in which we may take any pride at all , and that in our way with the problem of unemployment we should remind ourselves of the Ozark man reported by the Arkansas Traveller . lie played the banjo and never mended his roof . When it was raining , ' he could n't , and when the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the depression comes , it is too late to do anything about it , and when we are not in a condition of depressions misery , we are too busy . But . where in all this scene of economic and social distraction will you identify a feeling of poverty ? It is not there . That is the new aspect of depression . A sense of frustration , foreboding , extreme anxiety , emotions of panic , anger , indignation , disillusionment , almost any other feeling you may think of , but for once and for the first time in a slough like this , no feeling of poverty . That is lost , And because we have lost it , all the more bitterly do we resent the surviving facts of poverty ; all the more do we incline to entertain ideas  --  even very strange ideas  --  whereby it may be proposed to abolish them forever . That they can he abolished , should and Will be abolished , is not disputed . It is only a question of how and by what means . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall make serious mistakes . Some of the precedents already established , wedgelike , under sanction of the immediate anxiety to relieve distress , have very radical implications . The social workers themselves probably do not know where their evangel leads ; opposition provokes them to be extreme and they would go very far . They have the advantage of appearing always on the human side , with an emotional contempt for any principle or theory of government that stands in the way of an ideal economic result , construed in terms of the individual life ; the advantage , moreover , of having a definite program , and now a kind of institutional power and tradition . When this emergency is gone , there will be an enormously expanded industry of social work , needing a larger clientele than ever before . Less and less do the social agencies speak of dependent people as dependents . They speak of them as their clients and take pride in the stability of a clientele  --  a very curious phrase . In that work already mentioned , The Report of the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chapter on social work , one reads : There are differences among social agencies in the standards of relief giving Jewish agencies appear to be more adequately financed ; more generous assistance to families and aid over longer periods of time , a more stable clientele , higher salaries and a lower case load per worker , are characteristic . A more stable clientele of dependents , that means . The executive secretary of the Family Welfare Association of America speaks of the effect of reduced relief budgets upon the clients of family-welfare bureaus . For the industry of social work , as for any other , a law of supply and demand will hold . Increase the demand for a clientele of dependents and the supply is bound to appear . But this is leading to questions that belong to another discussion . Here only the immediate matter is pertinent . Charity is personal . Mass relitif is impersonal . In a small village there may still he charity . There a family is in want . Everybody knows what family it is , the house it lives in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes of the right size , a little job of work for the man to do , will find their way to that door , and there is no overhead , no organization , no cost of administration . But what of maybe 150,000 families in one metropolitan area needing emergency relief ? They will have to be registered , investigated , classified according to their needs ; each one will have to sign papers , giving its history , together with some kind of proof that it has no longer any resources of its own , For it may turn out at any moment to be a fraudulent family , with money in the savings bank . You can not administer mass relief without system , method , office machinery . It may be temporary , yet it is a business , subject to business principles . Besides the social case workers in the field there must be a clerical personnel inside  --  hired , of course  --  to do typing , keep the files , manage the card index ; secretaries , voucher clerks , bookkeepers , accountants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so on . Thus you get overhead . It is generally somewhat under 10 per cent . Say it is 8 per cent . That is to say , given a dollar of relief money , ninety-two cents will go for relief and the rest for the cost of administering relief . One of the consequences of mass relief is a mass conscience , and from this special difficulties arise . Since it is the technic of good relief administration to spare dependent people the humiliation of receiving relief in a. public manner , and since , for other practical reasons  --  police reasons , if you like  --  it is desirable that the unemployed shall not be obliged to congregate in large numbers , it follows that a great deal of actual distress is kept invisible . What you may happen to see in the street is not the serious part of it ; what is relieved indoors you do not see at all . That may be all the better ; but there is an unintended result , which is that the public heart is not torn by such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private purse . The mass conscience votes a bond issue for purposes of mass relief and the private conscience is by that act quieted . After that it is all the harder for the relief organizations to command private contributions . Yet private giving is very much needed to swell the aggregate relief fund , and this will be increasingly true with each new bond issue , because , after a while , state and city credit begins to decline under the strain of public borrowing and bonds for relief purposes will be harder and harder to sell , if they can be sold any more at all . Scaring Out Contributions Unable to dramatize human distress to the eye in a way that would move people privately to give , the relief organizations , therefore , must dramatize it to the imagination . The idea of mass relief has to be sold . The method again is the method of business . To sell an idea effectively , you have to sell it hard . Those to whom it is being sold know this and secretly a little discount what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sell the idea all the harder . It would lie strange  --  less than human , indeed  --  if , in such a case given , there should be no tendency to overdramatize  --  not the particular facts , of course , but the relations and proportions of fact . Those responsible for selling the idea of mass relief to the private conscience have dramatized also a specter . They have invoked fear of uprisings and social disorder , with shuddering glances at revolution , and now and then a guarded intonation of that dread word . Such is the meaning of the suggestion that if your emotions are dull , still all the more you must give for a selfish reason . The unemployed will not he forever docile ; be not misled too far by the signs of their fortitude . There is a limit to what they will endure . A good deal of this from on high has provoked the ironic saying , now current , that the thought of revolution is active only in the minds of those who imagine what they would do if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The principal sources of relief money have been : ( 1 ) the tax funds in general , ( 2 ) public borrowing by the municipalities and states in the form of bond issues and bank loans specifically for relief purposes , ( 3 ) Federal aid , which until this year was limited to $300,000,000 in the hands of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to be loaned to municipalities on their promissory notes , provided they were unable to borrow on their credit anywhere . else enough money to relieve local distress , or raise it by new taxation ; ( 4 ) the resources of esisting social agencies , and ( 5 ) the proceeds of community drives on the private conscience , such as those conducted this season all over the country under a kind of national cooperative program , led and shaped by a National Citizens ' Committee , Newton D. Baker , chairman , in the name of Welfare and Relief Mobilization . The cooperative features of the plan have consisted in the mass production of posters , literature and advertising copy , and the free , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York City ; then mass meetings in the principal cities , addressed by the leaders of relief mobilization , whose voices , of course , were broadcast by radio  --  all for the purpose of creating a kind of national ceiling , under which each community then set its own goal and made its own drive , much as the Liberty Loan campaigns were managed in wartime . Local selling of mass relief under the stimulus of national advertising . The cost of this very effective national propaganda has been nominal , because so much has been contributed in the spirit of relief , even the posters , the advertising copy , the advertising space , the halls for mass meetings , the radio service and the transportation . Of the aggregate fund so far raised for emergency relief , it is estimated that public money provided by the municipalities , the states and the Government has represented three-quarters ; the other quarter has come from the private purse . All figures are approximate only . That is true not only as to the total expenditures for relief and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it is true also of the figures representing , to begin with , the amount of unemployment existing in the country . Never has it been possible to know exactly how many people were actually unemployed . They have been counted by statistical deduction . As for one day in April , 1930 , the Bureau of the Census happened to have an accurate count of the number of persons in the whole country out of a job , wanting work and looking for it . Its enumerators were not taking census of the unemployed , but they had that question to ask , among others , and filled the answers into their forms . The eumber was 2,429,062 . But this was before the depression had really begun . Nine months later , in January , 1031 , unemployment by that time having become an acute national problem , a special unemployment census was made , not for the whole country , because the Census Bureau had not the means for doing that , but for nineteen cities . In those nineteen cities , unemployment appeared to have increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was assumed that in the whole country the number of people out of a job , wanting work and looking for it , in January , 1931 , was what it had been in April , 1930 ? that is , 2,429,062 , plus an increase of 149 per cent , which gave the figure 6,050 , - 000 . This was to suppose that the percentage of increase over the whole country , urban and rural together , would be the same as it was in those nineteen cities . And all figures since then to express the total amount of unemployment in the country have been obtained by a statistical method of taking some index figure representing changes in the state of employment in certain areas of the country and applying it upside down to that first statistically derived quantity of 6,050,000 . Obviously , by any such method the factor of error is hound to be large ; and so it has been possible for perfectly sincere estimates to disagree by as much as 2,000,000 on the number of people actually unemployed at a given time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 5,000,000 . It is even more difficult to arrive at a sound figure to represent the total expenditures for emergency relief , either for any given period of time or from the beginning up to date . Sometime during this , the fourth , year of depression the cost probably will touch the mark of $2,000,000,000 . It is a colossal sum to have spent merely to relieve the social distress produced by a scourge of unemployment , with still no cure in view . There seems no pardon for it . You will think of many things we might have done with such a sum , of how much richer society would be if it could have been spent productively in ways to multiply our material and e=sthetic satisfactions . Work Relief vs . Money Relief When it began to appear that . the depression would be obstinate and of long duration , and that the public credit of municipalities and states might break under the strain of borrowing money to feed and clothe and house the unemployed , there were many proposals for creating employment . Public funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not immediately productive in the economic sense , or , as we say , self-liquidating , still , whatever they were , so long as they were tangible , the assets of society would be thereby increased . There would be something to show for the expenditure . Thus the idea of work relief , as different in all senses from money relief , became for a time important . But it was , after all , not entirely feasible , " Where do you get that stuff ? What can they do ? They do n't dare blast . We got the twist , have n't we ? They 'll blast her if they blast us ! If they start any angles playing , we 'll treat the dame to a dose that 'll stop ' em in their tracks . I know what I 'm doin ' . That mob is hung high an ' dry as long as we got the moll . An ' you can see for yourself , we got her ! " for the reason that work relief turned out to be more costly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency work and paying wages for it caused the cost of relief to rise , The same amount of money directly distributed would go further to relieve actual distress , and with always more distress in sight than funds wherewith adequately to relieve it , the choice was inevitable . Thus , although the idea of work relief was never abandoned , the practice of it broke down ; what came of it generally was much less than had been expected . What an awkward , painful , unscientific reduction of the national fat ! Two billions of dollars and nothing tangible to show for it . A prodigious sum and yet inadequate ; an incredible sum and at the same time relatively insignificant . For , in a relative sense , what is it ? It is only 4 per cent of what had been in good times one year 's pay roll  --  one year 's aggregate disbursement of wages and salaries . The Rainy.Day Fund It is now an offense to all our new ways of thinking to speak of old-fashioned thrift . Why should people do without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of everything apparently plenty , if not too much ? Nevertheless , suppose that instead of prodigally spending our whole income and going into debt , besides , we had saved , each individual in his own way , only 2 per cent of the aggregate pay roll during the five or six prosperous years that immediately preceded the depression , when the annual disbursement of wages and salaries was rising to $50,000,000,000 a year . From the sum thus imagined , you might deduct all the savings that have been lost in hank failures and still have a private reserve for lean living through a period of hard times much greater than all the fund that has been raised to relieve private distress as a public responsibility . If the effect of such private thrift in place of reckless spending had been to flatten the boom , so much the better , for in that case we should not have had so far to fall . But the thought of moving responsibility back to the individual is anticlockwise . Since the individual hitherto has not handled his responsibility very well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . People can not be trusted to do their own saving , or to save enough ; therefore , the state most do it for them . That is the philosophy of compulsory unemployment insurance , to be managed by the state ; and we appear to be now on our way to try that European experiment . Yet there is no way for the state to save up a reserve fund against unemployment but from the stream of current wealth out of which people might save it for themselves , if only they were self-responsible .
