THE WEDDING GUEST A STORY BY FREDERICK FAUST W HEN I was in Paris , Olympe Arouet wrote to me : " Dear Paul , now you are in France , but May is still cold in Paris . Do come into the summer and visit us . Besides , I have a need to sec you . That is a need very much . Will you come ? " I had probably not seen Olympe more than six times altogether , but these were spread through ten years and , since I had been a Christian name to her father , I suppose she had inherited the fashion of using it . Jean Arouet had been an entomologist , and in his torture chambers , which he called his " studies , " I had seen a praying mantis clamp a cricket in its hinged saws and turn its pointed little face to me as if inviting my attention before it began to eat . Jean Arouet was proud to claim that blood of Voltaire ran in his veins but , making a good modern transition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man , Jean Arouet speared insects in the name of Science . He was a tall , lean , bending man with so many things on his mind that he never could keep his eyes steady . He talked very well , though his French was too fast for me most of the time ; but anyway it was not for his conversation that I went to see him . He had collected not only a great many insects but also a number of good American bonds , and that was where I came in as his broker . When I received that letter from his daughter it was not of the dead man I thought or of Olympe 's grave face with its high cheekbones and sober eyes . She was carrying on her father 's work , understood , and that meant she would still he dressed in gray high-collared smocks . Jean Arouet said that she had the eye and touch which makes for perfect dissection under the microscope . Yet I saw her less vividly than I saw Provence ; for a spirit that is neither France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had breathed of it . Some countries are old and dead : Provence is old like the sea . I do n't mean Avignon alone , but even the open country , whether it undulates slowly or lies in strange colored flats . It is a land that is never wholly seen , but the thought of it comes over the mind in a pleasant mist and strangeness , not of twilight and night only , but even of the midday when the distances withdraw into the shimmering of that strong sun . All of this Provence , which can be tasted and remembered but never spoken , spread warmly out from the page of Olympe 's letter . " May is cold in Paris " ; but every month is cold in Paris , after Provence . " Besides , I have a need to see you . That is a need very much . " Well , she was ten years younger than I , and twenty-five ; with high cheek bones  --  that type in which the skull shows a little through the face , steps rapidly out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seasonless and virgin aridity . And yet an ardor that was truly Provencal came out of that one twisted phrase : " That is a need very much . " It kept me hurrying all the way ; it was well underlined in my mind by the time I swerved my car off the wide , white road and let it roll past the mottled and pale trunks of the plane trees until the curving drive brought me in front of the house . It was not too big to fit comfortably into the eye ; the color was more the stain of time than of yellow paint ; and what pleased me most was that I could remember even the details of the coat-of-arms over the big doors , where a thin-bellied lion , on one side , wagged his tail and stood up and stuck out his tongue at a dragon on the other side . It is always comfortable to remember with exactness ; all sorts of melancholy ghosts turn into commonplace reality and the future also seems secure . It was only the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the dawn to finish the second stage of the journey , and the servant who opened the door for me was in one of those long , gray , striped coats which save both shirt cuffs and the knees of trousers during housecleaning . Of course this grayness was what I expected , but when I stepped into the big hall I was startled to see flowers all about . The western windows were shuttered against the heat of the day , but through the open door there came Light enough to give me a first glimpse , and after it was closed I still saw great vases overflowing with yellow and white and red in the shadows . I was breathing the rich , bittersweet fragrance of roses when a whisper came down the stairs and Olympe walked out of the big , dark arch to me . I had heard that she was carrying on with her father 's work . Work my eye ! The cat was away for good and this mouse was playing . When I had been thinking that this type often steps quickly from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten about the ones who bloom . Part of this was French bloom , on the lips and cheeks , but the living eyes were real and the thin morning gown let some beauty glimmer through . She put out a hand not to take mine so much as to grasp a surprising idea . The brightness of it was in her face as she said : " But , Paul ! I did n't remember that you were so big . But , Paul ! " She spoke English better than she wrote it , with not many wrong constructions that I can remember , though she had the usual Latin trouble with the short " i , " and I was glad all up my spine that she deed n't remember that I was so beeg . She said that we would go into the garden , but just then a young fellow came in and gave me a quarter of a bow and a tenth of a smile and said , " It has happened , Mademoiselle Olympe . " She introduced me to him and his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There is nothing so sour as a sour Frenchman , and he was that sourest kind with a sallow skin and cheeks hollowed enough to press down the corners of the mouth . These fellows are all as tough as tool-proof steel but they look consumptive , and in me the look is father to the wish . When Olympe heard that " it had happened " she waited a moment , looking at me , considering my will . Already she had made me feel twenty pounds bigger . My business had been going with a limp and a stagger ever since ' 29 , but I stood beside Olympe inwardly feeling myself one of those fabled giants of the Street , inscrutable , weighty , and profound . I could have announced opinions on the farm problem , or anything . " Have you ever seen the Great Peacock  --  the moth , Paul ? " she said . " Come upstairs for one little minute . It is so beautiful . " I was ready to go with her anywhere for more than one leetle mcenute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open loggia that served for a hall . This gave me a glimpse of the garden behind the house that once had been palms and rounded beds of brown dead grass with frazzled edges , but now it was dazzling in the sun and glowing in the shadow ; even the lady of the fountain had come to life and threw a cypress-shaped radiance into the air . Why , the world was no longer dying but living ; no , not the world but just old Provence , the beautiful and the guilty . We went into a bare room with an old deal table in the middle and a little dome of wire screen on the table , and inside the screen was the great Peacock moth . What could one say of the grays and the browns of the wings , bordered with white , and four black eyes set into them ? No , only the pupils were black , for out of the iris colors dissolved and spread the rings of white and black and dull crimson and exquisite rosy brown . It was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so big ! But there were more things to say that will not come pat in words except that I remember how I wanted to touch the deep brown of it and began to smile with pleasure at the mere thought . Olympe clasped her hands in excitement so that I saw the light tremble on the red enamel of her nails as she bent over the wire gauze of the prison . " It is not a prince but a princess , Francois , " she said to the fellow who was her assistant in the laboratory . " See how she is feathered with softness , Paul ! " I liked that . It made me smile as much as though I had touched the beauty . Feathered with softness ! And it looked that way inspite of its size , as though the thin air could float it . ' ' She is a princess , now , but she is going to be a queen . Francois , open the window . You 've forgotten to open the window . " Francois looked at me still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but as he opened the window he told Olympe to remember that the Great Peacock was barely out of the cocoon and that there was still time . " There ! There I " said Olympe gently . She went to the window and held her hands out into the sunshine . The rest of her was exciting enough , but her hands were lovely and perfect now covered with bright gold . " Now the news is passing out , " she said . " The wind is carrying it . Do you see that poplar trembling and silvering , Paul ? You can hear the whisper spreading . " She kept her hands spread out in the heat of the sun ; her eyes were half closed ; she began to laugh , and the laughter was only a whisper too . " What 's the news that 's passing through the window ? " I asked Francois . " The sort of news that the male moths want to hear , " he said . He kept his eyes fixed on the girl and spoke as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't many of them . Only at the feet of the oldest almond trees . But this news will go to them even against the wind and they 'll come for leagues . " Olympe had raised her head and , with closed eyes , let the full strength of the sun pour against her face . I was sure she did not hear Francois continuing , with a slow sneer in his voice , " One mate , and all the rest are wedding guests . They die the same day . They do not eat . The mouth-parts are only vestigial . They always dance round the wedding couple and they always die . " I think he would have gone on in the same quiet , ironical voice , but Olympe now turned from the window . Somehow I felt that he had not been talking about the moths but telling use that he loved the girl . We went down into the garden and sat on a bench where the crystal shadow of the fountain kept flowing over our feet . Now that 1 was close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been altered from its old condition very long before . The ragged grass borders had been trimmed to neatness and flowers were blooming even in shadowy places where they could never have grown , so that I began to guess that the whole place had been brightened suddenly by putting potted plants in the ground . Some of the big blossoms had commenced to lean on dying stalks ; I could not help thinking of a stage set and wondering what the action of the play would be , or if it had already commenced with me as an unconscious actor . This sense of unreality that contained me as part of the illusion was not a thing to smile at , for it was like having the print of a book dissolve and widen into the green and gold and blue of nature , all the beauty of summer enlarging from the poor words that had contained it . To give that illusion force and weight , here was Olympe Arouet beside me with the grayness of her old life laid away and a distance of imagination , beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the past . Excitement that had commenced to warm my blood when watch and to expect , hoping that I should soon recognize the part that had been assigned to me . If this seems very extraordinary or fanciful language , nevertheless , the bearing of Olympe was that of one before a great audience and her expression kept changing as though she were listening to several persons instead of one . I remember casting about for things to talk of , and that I thought of trying the weather , the garden , Provence ; but all of these merely made a setting for the girl . She was talking on , and all at once I realized that she had asked me a question . So I said frankly , " I 've not been hearing you very well . I 've been too busy looking at you and thinking about you . " She was very pleased ; she began to laugh , with her eyes resting on mine . " Ah , Paul , how nice of you ! " she said . " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I studied being this way , and now I am this way . Do you like it ? " I smiled , and she laughed at herself again . " I want to be assured and reassured , " she said . " Like a baby tak-ing its first steps . " - " You 're not a baby , " I told her seriously , because I was alarmed . It is high time to be afraid when a girl becomes so extremely naive . " But say what it was that made you send for me ? " I went on . " Ah , because I wanted to see you , my old friend . And then besides there is the other thing . But how am I going to talk about that ? How am I to say it ? " She caught her face in her hands and looked askance at the fountain , as though she might find help in the brightening and the showering of the water . " I must find a way of saying it , " she murmured . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to say the important thing which might put art end to my visit . She was in some sort of trouble , no doubt ; she was in some sort of money trouble , of money doubt and , though I should be glad to give advice or help , I felt that I wanted to be something more than a broker just then . " There is plenty of time , " I said . " Ah , is there plenty of time ? " she asked , with a great breath of relief . " There 's all the time in the world . " " Then I need n't hurry ? I can wait ? and find the words ? Ah , how good that 1st Just for a little while , even for a day or two , you will forget Paris and New York , Paul ? " At this she touched my arm and appealed to me with her face raised , so that I saw clearly the edges of the paint on her lips and the black that thickened her eyelashes ; yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't do that , " I said , before I knew that the words were coming . " What ? " she asked , drawing back her hand quickly . " What have 1 done , Paul ? Ah , you see I have spent so much time with insects that I do n't know how to talk to menl " That made me smile . " The fact is ? " I began . But then she broke in , " Do n't explain . If you 'll keep on smiling , everything is all right , and I do n't want you to explain . " We got to lunch time quickly , for time moves very fast when one is trying to lay hold on every passing minute . Once when I was in Italy I remembered leaving the heat of Florence to go to the Lido , and sitting in the deep shadow of a hotel veranda and never turning my head , for fear the world behind me would not be as happy as my heart , and simply watching the high wall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue stain of distance as they reached the top . This day with Olympe Arouet was like that . Something like air-hunger made me take a deep breath now and then ; the cause of happiness wat partly in that old Provence and partly in the girl , and as time rushed by me I was afraid to arrest its flight by trying to understand . The dining room was big and still and cool and dim . Francois , who sat with us , was almost lost in the shadow except for the gleam of his eyes as he turned them toward me ; but Olympe shone in all lights . What we ate I do n't remember , but there was a wine of Alsace , well iced , with a thin bouquet and good clean taste . After lunch came siesta time , but late in the afternoon Olympe appeared again in a dress of rough , misty blue . It looked loose and easy and cool , but quite smart enough for Paris . And time began to sweep past me like a wind again until , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide horizon . Then I remembered myself and said , " It 's time for me to get to town and find a room in the hotel . " " In the hotel ? A room in the hotel ? " cried Olympe . " But see this big house  --  it has always been too full of rooms , and yours is ready for you . The one where you had your siesta . Could n't you be happy in that room ? " 1 thought of the tall curtains and the whispering airs and the great jars out of which the flowers rose and leaned . But , " You know , Olympe , you have n't a chaperon in the house . The room is charming , but of course I ca n't spend the night here . " She thought about this for only a moment before she said , " Well , there 's Francois for a chaperon . " " That youngster ? " I exclaimed . " Knowledge is what counts , and Francois knows everything , " she answered . She laughed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francois will be perfect as a chaperon , " she said , " and of course you are going to stay . " I felt that it was very wrong , but to give any French girl advice always seems a foolish impertinence . Anyway I stayed . We walked about through the garden a bit longer before Olympe went up to dress for dinner . I followed more slowly , knowing that I was doing wrong but entirely happy about it . I suppose there arc few pleasures that are not improved by a small sense of guilt . Just as I came into the hall a very odd thing happened . The lights flashed on , making the sky beyond the windows a deeper blue , and in the corner of the hall I saw Francois with his hand still on the electric switch . The fellow watched me across the room like a cat , but as I came to the foot of the stairs I knew that he was smiling . Somehow he was relieved  --  relieved and triumphant . I turned about quickly and the smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's the news of the Great Peacock ? " I asked , to justify the manner in which I had turned . " Oh , they 'll be arriving , perhaps before night , " he said , with a French shrug of his French shoulders . " Pouring into that room upstairs ? " I asked . " And the other rooms , " said Francois . " A lot of the wedding guests lose their way . " The sneer with which he spoke became unendurable . I turned away , and the memory of his smile followed up the stairs behind me . I could not get the chill out of my blood until I had finished bathing and dressing because I kept remembering what the girl had said  --  that Francois knew everything . Confound him , I began to fear that he did ! Downstairs I found Olympe dressed in white and completing herself with a corsage of flowers . She had blue and yellow and red to choose from but she appealed to me to make a choice . " But I know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to cover the three little bouquets from my eyes . " I have it in my hand now . " " Show it to me and I 'll be honest , " I said . She held out the red and I nodded at once . " I thought so , " she said , and I knew that I had made a mistake though I could not see why . But how can any man understand a woman when what seems to us the most faint and devious path may be the broad , straight road to her heart ? Francois appeared , silent and yellow as always , and made himself useful serving dry vermouth with fragrant , thin shavings of lemon peel dropped into it , while Olympe pinned the miniature red roses at her breast , smiling down at them or at her hands . Afterward she made me sit in a high-backed red chair . The red velvet that lined it was a bit motheaten , but that only helped it to look authentic and baronial . She surveyed me , from the arm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a happy day , Paul ? There is something in the quiet down here , and a few people like it . Have you been happy ? " I told her that there was a lot in the quiet down there , and that I was very happy . " Yes , after Paris , " she said . " Paris is a plus for some people , but it is a minus for others . It 's a minus for me . " Now , as she sat there chatting , her voice soft and her smile continuing , 1 could feel that she was judging me in relation to that stiff-backed velvet chair which framed me . For the second time I was aware of her criticism and because of that , perhaps , all at once I knew that I was in love with Olympe Arouet . All the other women I had cared for became as dim as pictures in a family album ; the dust of time covered them , throat and lips and hair . I knew also that Olympe had made me love her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose ; but by the very knowing of these facts I was subdued , and by the simultaneous assurance that at this same moment she was not quite sure of the wisdom of her course . What is a man to do in a time like this ? If he tries to be entertaining he is apt to make himself into a grinning ape ; if he is silent he is a boor . On the other hand , he may become demonstrative , and that is apt to be the worst of all . I was cold with anxiety and now I told myself that I understood why Francois refilled my glass with almost an air of kindness . I could swear that he himself loved Olympe , but already he had ceased worrying about me . I was filled with a very still and deep desire to murder Francois except that when he was gone I would lose with him the answer to that riddle which he seemed to understand . What he had said about wedding guests going astray  --  that was what got between me and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time that the tires of an automobile came grinding over the gravel of the driveway and stopped before the house . A moment later a servant appeared and announced that a man 's automobile was out of order and that the chauffeur would have to work at it , but the gentleman asserted he was a friend of the house and sent in his card . Olympe took it , canted her head a bit to one side , frowned , and then looked up at the man who had stepped into the doorway . He was dressed in rough tweeds . It looked as though the wind had been tousling his hair all day long and his forehead had been polished red-brown by the sun . He was tall but sparely made and his shoulders were a trifle bent . Yet what a man he seemed ! Young , I mean , and smiling because he found the world young with him . There was an alertness in his carriage , and the very bend of his shoulders gave him the look of one leaning forward to run . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his look  --  he was more distinguished in that travel-ing suit than a diplomat in tails with a string of gaudy medals and ribbons across the breast . When Olympe went up and spoke to him , he bowed over her hand in a way that no American has ever been able to bow ; no , not trained dancers even . His manners were those of a race which for a thousand years has looked at women as though they were queens of Sheba but which has treated them as though they were not worth a damn . While Olympe Arouet talked to him I could see her head lifting by degrees , and when she turned towards us again , I knew that she had taken something into her eyes . She introduced him to us with a sort of happy unconsciousness . When he came closer , he seemed much more foreign than at a distance . His head was well made but there was a boniness about the temples and a distinct slant of the eyes . His name I never made out very clearly but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Borik , or Zborik , or Borikh , and the first name was Crassin , perhaps spelled with a " k " and a " z . " I thought he was a Russian , but he might have been a Magyar or a Pole or even a Mongolian . AlI Western tongues were hard for him , as I learned before the evening was over , yet he seemed able to understand Olympe and she certainly understood him from the moment when he began apologizing for his clothes to the time we all sat down at the dinner table . It appeared that his chauffeur had hopes of repairing the car soon , and that it was important for Borik to be on his way again as soon as possible . How glad I was of that ! I wanted to leave the table and help the chauffeur . The engine trouble , it appeared , had developed only a few miles down the road and then Borik , or Zborik , or whatever his name was , had remembered that many years ago he had come from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jean Arouet . " But I remember it perfectly well now , " said Olympe . " You were the tall boy in the uniform . Do you still wear uniforms ? " " Why should we , except on a golf course ? " said Borik  --  at least , that was the meaning I got out of his chopped and broken French . Olympe laughed a good deal at that , and even let her eyes leave his face for a moment to welcome Francois and me into her mirth , but I could not smile . If only that chauffeur might be inspired to finish his work soon  --  that was my only thought . Sometimes Francois and I looked straight at each other . His expression was that of a man listening to faraway sounds , and 1 know that mine was the same . Olympe ran on about the visit and the wise , bearded face of Borik 's father . " He is dead , " said Borik , and closed his eyes and smiled . That hit me  --  the calm , clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for " dead " well enough and he brought it out in his melodious voice with a trifle of Oriental sing-song , caused I suppose by the effort of finding strange words . I hoped the cold blood of this would shock Olympe , and it did . The smile left her face as though a shadowy gesture had removed it . She leaned and stared for an instant ; then her trouble disappeared . All this , mind you , took hardly longer than the flicker of an eyelash , but then I saw , or guessed with Olympe , that the eyes of Borik had closed in exquisite anguish . He was tasting that death again , not smiling at it . It 's a small thing to write about . It was n't a small thing to see . It lasted a second , but that was long enough to take one winging into a strange land where people can look the end of things in the face and keep on smiling . I felt rather dizzy , returning again to that table which Olympe had made so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  at which Francois and I represented the losers . Borik went on talking about his father . I think I understood him more by the words and the murmured sympathy of Olympe , which commented on everything . Just what the situation was I do not know , but there had been some sort of a rising and the castle had been filled with yelling murder . A few of the faithful had dragged Borik away from his father ? to save the line  --  and I suppose it had been some little principality not too obscure for revolution to find it out . And then the father had turned and faced the murderers in a narrow hall , covering the rescue of the boy . " He stood like this , " said Borik . ' With a lift of his hand and his head he showed how the brave old man had stood . The tears began to run down Olympe 's face , but a moment later Borik had us out in the wind among the icy rocks of winter mountains , the pursuit laboring behind so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees as I listened . Then Borik was at the verge of a great lake , he was pushing out in a small boat , and as the waves hurled him about , a thick squall ran over the waters and shut him away from the view of his enemies . " But my father was dead ! " he finished . Jealousy feeds on all things , even the tenderest ; but though I wished Borik any place away from that house , even in hell , 1 liked him as well at that moment as I have ever liked any man . I do n't mean that Borik spent the entire dinner time talking about his own experiences  --  and death . He did his gallant best to get Francois into the conversation and I remember that he told me with a sort of an air that he A had seen New Yolk , once  --  in a picture bookl He raised his hand and his eyes and then shuddered ; there are a good many people who feel that way about New York , but Borik smiled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to value such a mighty bigness and majesty and ugliness . After dinner we went into the salon on the way to the garden , where Olympe had suggested a walk , but Borik spied the piano and he brushed the three of us into the garden ahead of him , with his gestures and his bows ; afterward we heard the piano and the voice of Borik singing . He had neither range nor strength ; some of his notes squeaked and others were shouted ; but he did the thing with a strength of race , so to speak , and out there in the black-and-white of the garden by moonlight we felt the wildness of joy and the wildness of sorrow of which music can make one theme . Olympe sat down on the first bench with Francois on one side of her and me on the other . She lay back with her head reclining , given up to listening . There was enough wind to blow the shadow of a branch across her , so that she was continually between the moon and the darkness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drifting away from us toward the music . " Paul , " she said , " were you ever in love ? " " Yes , " I answered . " Tell me about it , " said Olympe . " Tell me about it , while I listen . " Tell her about a love affair of mine while she listened to Borik 's Oriental music ? Well , I told her , clearly , so that Francois could listen also . I tried to make another night , far away in California , but still farther away in my own mind , live again there in Provence in the untrue beauty of that garden . She listened devoutly  --  always more to the music than to me , and once shelooked up at me and said , " Was it like that ? " and sorrow that music knows nothing about went through me . She was using my words , not me . In the meantime that damned chauffeur might save everything if he would only hurry with his work I The music ended . Borik stood on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying that he was tired . He was so tired that he wanted to lie down and sleep , even if it were only for an hour . Francois and I looked at each other suddenly as Olympe sprang to her feet . She had no idea that the evening was to end like this and she went up to Borik and talked eagerly to him . But he merely looked down at his hands on the balustrade and shook his head . I do n't know what she had suggested ? a walk , a talk ; but she was completely indignant over this ungentlemanly behavior . She turned about and said , " I 'm tired also . Francois , will you show him a room ? There is an extra one ready , I think . " She turned back to Borik and said , " Perhaps I shall not have the pleasure of seeing you again , monsieur . Perhaps your car will be repaired before morning and you will be gone . Therefore , adieu . " He bowed over her hand , and she went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone , there was no reason why I should remain in that damned garden with the ghost of Borik 's singing about me , so I went up to bed in my turn . I passed Francois in the upper hall and he said , " But perhaps , after all ? " I let him finish off his idea with his own gesture and went gloomily on . But then I reached the open door of a room and saw Olympe standing at the window with the moonlight sloping over her . She had thrown over her shoulders a great cloak of figured velvet and , since her hands were on her hips , I thought of the soft , unfolded wings of the Great Peacock . " Olympe ? " I said . She turned her head , silently , but I could see that she was smiling , and that was what chew me across the room until I faced her . There was enough in me to have poured out song and poetry but all I could say was , " I love you1 " She laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little . It was not exactly a gesture to withhold me but rather like that of one who supports a book at the proper distance for reading . I noticed then a very thin , an almost impalpable fragrance , and afterward I saw that she was smiling . She was not using me for her mirth but I knew that I stood at a great distance . I stepped back a little . Her hand remained where it had been , half-extended ; her smile remained also , and I had to set my teeth and gather my strength before I could walk out of that room . A few minutes later 1 was lying in my bed , swearing through stiff lips in a whisper . There had been no reason for waiting for a silly convention at such a time . I could see now that the best plan for me would have been to talk as soon as possible  --  even that morning , or certainly in the evening , and then perhaps I could have drawn her to me forever . The last I remember of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I was telling myself that I would have her in spite of Borik and the devil . When I wakened there was a whispering in the room , a queer hushing noise that made me snap on a light which showed me half a dozen great Peacock moths fluttering around the room ; and I realized that the call of the female had gone out , as Olympe had said it would , and had brought in the searchers . These were some ofthose wedding guests that had missed the way . I sat up in the hed and looked at the great beauties drawing their uneasy circles closer and closer to the glare of the light . And then I heard a sound like a drawn breath with a choking sob in it out in the hall . I pulled on a dressing gown , stepped into slippers , and jerked the door open , and saw Francois close by . The moon had shifted until the light of it slanted through the arcades of the hall , and by that illumination I saw that the face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fouled with dust . His coat was ripped open . He came right up to me . Blood spattered from his lips as he said , And you  --  you slept  --  you slept , you ? " He meant a great deal of insult , but somehow I was in no humor to resent what he said because it was clear that we had at least one important interest somewhat in common . And then I heard the sudden rattle of a self-starter in front of the house , the whine of a departing motor . A horn sounded , already small with distance . Francois leaned a hand against the wall and nodded at me . He laughed , and the laughter did horrible things to his face . " Now he is gone , " said Francois . He was ready to go , and he has gone . And I  --  and you ? " He began to laugh again and then went down the hall with a bit of a stagger in his step . His door closed and shut me out by myself in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my mindOlympe , Borik , Francois , the Great Peacock moth . But I could guess that it was Borik who had started the red dripping down the sallow face of Francois . Then I heard a quick , light step farther down the hall . I saw someone open the door of that bare room in which the Great Peacock female was enclosed . I followed and passed in . All the air of the room was one gay confusion for there were thirty , forty , fifty of the huge butterflies sweeping out of the corners of the room to dance around the central light in the ceiling . In spite of Francois there was still sleep in my mind , but the last of it was scattered when I saw that Olympe was there . And with the sight of her that entire day became as dim as something dreamed but never lived , a vision that would melt in the first bright hour of reality . For now I saw her as I had expected to find her when I came down from Paris . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and from her face every trace of makeup had been removed , so that one could see , as I had expected , the shadowy outline of the skull striking through the flesh , as it were . I had thought that she was beautiful , but she was not even pretty now . She said , " Close the door , Paul . But even if you left it open they would not leave . " " Olympe , " I said , " I 've seen Francois and  --  what has happened in the house ? " Now I saw that although her face was as arid and gray as a desert , her eyes held an abundance of light . And I knew that it would never stop welling into them . Instead of answering me , she said , " You might even leave the door open to cool the room , because the Great Peacocks wo n't leave . They 're dancing at the wedding feast , you know . " I stared at her . Comprehension began to come over me suddenly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't mean  --  Olympe ? " I began to laugh , easily . For the day , you see , was already lost in the intangible part of existence , the dreams . She spread her hands toward the moths . " How beautiful they are , the poor dears , " she said .
