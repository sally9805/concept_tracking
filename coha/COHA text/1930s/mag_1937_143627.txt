New York 's Yiddish theatre district on lower Second Avenue , which has produced such fine actors as Paul Muni , does not often bring forth a popular song . Last week it had apparently turned the trick . <P> In 1933 the J. &; J. Kammen Music Co. published a song entitled Bei Mir Bist Du Schn , from a Jewish musical comedy ( I Would If I Could ) by Sholom Secunda and Jacob Jacobs . The song went practically unnoticed until last summer Johnny &; George , a Negro piano team , played it at a Jewish summer resort in New York 's borsch belt , then brought it to a Broadway night club . There it was heard by Saul Chaplin and Sammy Cahn , two East Side boys who had written Posin ' , Shoe Shine Boy , Rhythm Is Our Business , could recognize a song when they heard it . They put English lyrics to Bei Mir Bist Du Schn , retained the original title , carried it to Harms , their publishers . Harms , delighted with the plaintive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , arranged with J. &; J. Kammen Music Co. to split royalties from the English version between Chaplin &; Cahn and Secunda &; Jacobs . <P> But even before Harms could get the song printed , Bei Mir Bist Du Schn ( You Look Beautiful to Me ) had become a hit . Decca had two records out : the Andrews Sisters ' , which had already sold 10,000 copies , and Glen Gray 's . Brunswick had released a Russ Morgan version , and at Manhattan 's Paramount Theatre the crowd called for four encores the first time Morgan played it . Victor had Guy Lombardo 's recording of the song ready this week in time to be put on sale with the sheet music . First day 's sheet sale ( 7,000 ) indicated that Bei Mir Bist Du Schn might be as sensational as The Music Goes ' Round and Around .
