Discouraged by a steady decline in the number of U. S. students studying languages , and by the racial and religious discriminations against teachers in other lands - which they deplored*-2,500 members of the Modern Language Association met for their 55th convention last week in Manhattan . On hand to comfort them with a puckish ode to " useless knowledge " was Dr. Joseph Wood Krutch , literary critic and English professor at Columbia University . <P> " You have at the present time , " said he , " a new reason for being proud . The scholar is supposed to be a man who has renounced the world . But the world has very seldom seemed more eminently worth renouncing . . . . The Modern Language Association 's only object is the accumulation of useless knowledge , and of useless knowledge at least one thing may be said - it never did anyone any harm . . . . Some day when a little child climbs upon your knee to ask : ' Grandpa , what did you do during the Great War ? ' you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Child , I studied the subjunctive mood . ' " <P> M. L. A. 's pleased delegates proceeded to trade each other all sorts of useless knowledge . From Harold W. Bentley , managing editor of American Speech , they got a report on names of U. S. towns and cities . Samples : Social Circle , Wide Mouth , Jingo , Sleepy Eye , Matrimony , Hot Coffee . University of Virginia 's Professor Atcheson L. Hench delivered a scholarly discourse on the history of the term " stark-naked " ( from start-naked , literally : buttocks-naked ) . Most superbly useless piece of information given to the convention was a paper on The Pronunciation of German Surnames in Potosi , Wisconsin . <P> * American Association of Teachers of German , meeting just before M. L. A. , had squelched a resolution of sympathy with " victims of fanaticism in Germany . " In protest , the New York City chapter threatened to secede from A. A. T. G.                    @
