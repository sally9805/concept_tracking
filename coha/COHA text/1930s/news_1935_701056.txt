txt EXCERPTS FROM LETTERS ON SUBJECTS OF CURRENT INTEREST War Materials Lacking . In THE NEW YORK TIMES of Feb. 17 , appeared a- statement that " Chromite is the one war material which the United States does not have in ample . quantities within its borders . " As a matter of fact there are twenty-six of these strategic materials . To call attention to our lack of nickel resources is distinctly elementary . Tin is also practically non-existent within the continental United States . There are other war minerals in insufficient quantity , but the problem becomes a little more complicated than with the three already mentioned . To say that chromite resources in the Philippines would be equivalent to a war reserve of chromite situated within the confines of the continental United States would imply complete control of the seas . The war that we have to fear is with an enemy that Might very conceivably hold control of the Pacific Ocean , which would materially interfere with transport of chromite from the Philippines. ?
