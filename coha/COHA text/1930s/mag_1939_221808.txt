When Southern churchmen get together with Northerners , they usually keep their eyes peeled for a tar baby . Last week at Atlanta 's big , good-willing congress of the Baptist World Alliance , even the highest-minded Southerners felt sticky when , congregating in social groups , they were approached by a Negro who repeatedly exclaimed : " I am a Negro . I do n't guess you want me around . " The Negro , Dr. H. M. Smith of Chicago , thereupon telegraphed newspapers , declaring that " numerous racial signs " were displayed at the congress meeting place . <P> The signs designated the groups represented in the Alliance , including the two U. S. Negro bodies , National Baptist Convention and National Baptist Convention of America. * They were meant simply to make it easy for the Baptists to find their friends . But down came the signs , at the order of Dr. James Henry Rushbrooke , goat-bearded British secretary of the Alliance , who said crisply , " Do n't let 's have any more nonsense about color . " Not quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the election of a " consecrated , learned , experienced black minister " as president of the Alliance , to " answer the challenge from barbaric paganism . " He nominated Dr. Lacey Kirk Williams , learned black pastor of one of the world 's largest churches , Chicago 's Olivet Baptist ( membership : some 10,000 ) . The Alliance then elected Dr. Rushbrooke its president . There was no more nonsense about color , most delegates feeling that Atlanta , which quietly shelved some of its racial laws during the congress , had kept tar-baby trouble at a minimum . <P> If racialism bothered the congress little , nationalism caused it some trouble . Most of the " messengers " were for telling off Hitler and Mussolini . Thereupon a German Baptist bitterly accused the congress of not understanding Germany , while an Italian defended Il Duce as Baptism 's protector against the Roman Catholic Church . Dr. Rushbrooke , with no particular national ax to grind , made a speech which further suggested that , in Europe , religious minorities like the Baptists try to play off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure of the priest , " rather than King Carol , for Baptist troubles in Rumania . He paid his respects to " the intolerant temper of the Roman Catholic hierarchy in Spain , " but cited Generalissimo Franco 's pledges for freedom of worship , which he said he believed . <P> <P> *Baptist groups which do not believe in foreign missions and " human institutions " such as Sunday school do not belong to the Alliance . Stay-at-homes-unless they wished to pay 25 to sit in the audience at night meetings of the congress-were Foot-Washing , Two-Seed-in-the-Spirit , Hard Shell Primitive , Six-Principle , Seventh Day , Free Will , Streaked Head Baptists . All these sects are small , quirky .
