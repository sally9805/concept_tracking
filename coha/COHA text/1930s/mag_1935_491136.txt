T WO processional ideas now control both our economic thought and our political conduct ; and , like Fabre 's caterpillars , all the other ideas we have seem to follow these two round and round the endless rim of the jar , on the way to somewhere .. One is the idea of limitation ; the other is the idea of division . What shall be limited is the free , competitive proliferation of material wealth . What shall be progressively divided is that same wealth , the production of which shall be limited . The idea of limitation proceeds from the blind notion that we have not only of everything already enough , but the ruinous potentiality of too much . The idea of division follows that assumption and itself proceeds from the admirable emotions of economic idealism . All the premises are fascinating , as , for example , the premise now so familiar that the problems of production have been solved , witness the fact that we know how to produce more than we can buy ; or the premise that the life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking , all that is necessary is to pass proper laws of division . They are such premises as ought to be true . However , if they are not true they are perilous . If it is possible by any principle to produce less and divide more , then the spectacle of a toiling , upward-groping human race , self-condemned to the scars of thrift , saving and privation , is meaningless , and no mind can rightly conceive the irony of it . If it is not possible , then these two ideas together  --  one of limitation and the other of division  --  can lead only to disaster ; and if we follow them far we shall learn how much easier it is to make ourselves poor than it was to make ourselves rich . And it will not be as if we had made ourselves poor on purpose , in the manner of the Spartans . More than 700 years before Christ , the Spartans had a ruler who perceived that they could not all be equally rich , yet he believed in equality and so resolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with these two ideas  --  namely , limitation and division . He limited agricultural production by dividing the land , to each free citizen an equal portion and just . enough to provide the minimum of sustenance for himself and his family , so that no one should have a surplus . Then he suppressed gold and silver money and put in place of it iron money ; and the value he fixed for iron money was such that a cart and yoke of oxen were required to move the mass of iron that repre-sented a trifling sum . That put an end to business and deprived everyone of the incentive to produce or accumulate surplus wealth . Traders , artists , teach-ers , enterprisers and capi-talists all fled . Nothing luxurious could be imported because nobody could pay for it , and nothing could be exported because there was no surplus of anything to sell . Then he made their houses to be all equally fude , no sawed lumber in them , no ornamentation whatever , lest they should be tempted to compete in the vanities of better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were glad to dine out at a common mess table . Thereafter for ninny years the Spartans passed their time in mental heroics and rituals of athletic idleness . except to mind their slaves , who did all the work , and occasionally to exert themselves in war . The Spartan was the poorest , hardest , freest. of ( he Greeks ; but . a slave was more a slave in Sparta than anywhere else in the Greek world . With his two ideas of limitation and division , Lycurgus , the Spartan ruler , was logical . He produced exactly the effect he intended . But in the modern case there is no ideal of equal poverty . Not even the Communists want that . By limitation and division we are to achieve the more abundant life . We shall work less , produce less and divide more . The free competitive system endured for a century and a half . We were founded upon it ; and at about the same time in Europe it superseded the policy of regulation , restraint and licensed monopoly that had hindered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the Middle Ages . Whatever its ruthless evils  --  and they were many  --  the free system did increase divisible wealth at a rate that had never before been imaginable . By no other means had it been possible to create either the modern world in which we live or that immense body of surplus wealth that . does , temporarily at least , give the laudable extremes of economic idealism their appearance of immediate possibility . A System of Limitations and Restraints N O ONE could have imagined that we should ever return to the historic European policy of limitation that was administered jointly by the guildhall monopolies and by the crown  --  a system of permissions , sanctions , edicts , fines , penalties , subsidies and minute regulations , touching every act of producing and exchanging wealth . That was the policy of a stationary world in which everything was made rigid by custom and law , in which the unemployed were treated as paupers and vagabonds , in which the increase of population , as the last result , was limited by toll of misery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of the free competitive system , we set up a scheme of limitations , jointly administered by a Federal bureaucracy representing the state and by business representing itself , and it touches , also by permission , sanction , edict , fine , penalty , subsidy and minute'regulation , everything we may think of to do in the field of economic exertion . The restraints are direct and indirect . Basically , first. , there is restraint of the land in order to limit the volume of crops ; this is accomplished both by the compulsion of edict and by subsidies . The farmer is paid by the Government not to produce a surplus . The money to pay him with is provided by drafts upon the public treasury and by taxes laid upon the consumer . Basically , second , are the restraints upon industry , designed so to limit . the industrial output that it shall balance with effective demand  --  that is to say , in order that no more of anything shall be produced than people can afford to buy at a fair price . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of plant capacity that is forbidden or restrained , in others the output itself , again in other cases the speed of the work or the operating time of the equipment , meaning the number of revolutions per day a machine shall be permitted to make . Such as these are direct physical limitations . Quite as effective , even more , perhaps , are the indirect restraints in the same laws of code . In some cases , minimum prices are fixed  --  that is to say , prices below which it is forbidden for anyone to sell . The minimum price acts as a positive limit upon production . When the demand at that price is satisfied , production must stop . At a lower price there may be a large unsatisfied demand  --  there is always  --  yet this further demand can not be met , the producer is forbidden by law to meet it , even if he should wish to do so , for to meet it would injure the price . In general , however , the laws of code , instead of fixing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and selling below cost . These are terms that can never be exactly defined . Their total effect is to give the Federal bureaucracy representing the Government and the code authorities representing business the power to control and restrain competition . To what end ? Entirely to the end that production shall be limited to a quantity that may be sold at a fair price . That must be the aim of any policy of limitation  --  the fair price . It was the aim of the guildhall monopolies of old in Europe . They are not to be understood otherwise than in relation to a conception of the just price . What justified the price was always beyond inquiry . Though it should hinder the increase of wealth , though it should create monopolies that were tyrannical , though by limiting the demand for labor it should make paupers and vagabonds , or , as we should say , unemployed , for whom workhouses had to be provided as charity ? " the men to grind malt and other works and the women to use their hand-deed , or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the just price that no one could define or account for was the very principle of economic stability . Now again we yearn for that blessing of economic stability , forgetful of the fact , first , that when it has been established by sanction and edict of Government , business concurring , it will have powerful means of defending itself , whether we like it or not , and the fact , secondly , that restraint of competition and limitation of output for the sake of a fair price are the terms of monopoly . Where Law Regulates Labor Hours BASICALLY , re in the third case , there is the restraint upon labor . This is a fundamental limitation . The hours of labor are foreshortened and limited by law purposely in order that more labor shall be required to produce a. given quantity of wealth , whereas for 150 years the first formula for increasing the sum of divisible wealth had been to raise the productivity of labor per man hour . As by the ingenuities of science , power and method the productivity per man hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hours been shortened , and that was leisure earned . Naturally in this way the hours of labor were shortened one-third or more during the life of the free system , and it was all earned . Now the hours are // shortened by law , the operative hand wherewith we produce all the satisfactions of life is restrained , not because the productivity per man hour has been suddenly increased but only in order that the product of industry may be divided among a greater number . And then , in order that the wage worker shall he able to pay the fair prices that are everywhere ordained for the limited output , there is fixed by law at the same time a fair price for labor  --  that is to say , a minimum wage . But if the production of divisible wealth be limited , so also and exactly will the real division be limited at last  --  not the division of money but the division of things  --  and although this may be temporarily obscured , although the realization may be for a while postponed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which fair prices and fair wages are paid , or to create artificial buying power by colossal movements of public credit , nevertheless , it will turn out to be a relentless fact ; and labor itself may discover that a minimum money wage fixed by law tends to become in effect a limitation upon real wages . It is not to be suggested that the idea of limitation will be found only in a certain climate of political thought  --  as to say , for example , that it is a mental property of the New Deal exclusively . It inhabits also the mentality of business , and it always has . No error is more common than to speak of the free competitive system as if it had been jealously defended by business . That is not so . Again and again business has betrayed it  --  believing in it and still betraying it . The explanation is that business has believed in it as the philosopher believed in virtue who said , " I see the better way and take the worse . " The weakness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historic sense it has it perceives the truth ; rationally it embraces the principles . The textbooks of its orthodoxy teach that although the free system destroys much , it destroys only to re-create , and that by competition wealth is enormously increased and may continue to be increased extravagantly without end . Yet monopoly is sweet ; the profit of today is the morsel itself . It would be almost unheard of for business to avert its face from an occasion to restrain competition for the immediate profit of the industry or the trade as a whole . The Weakness for Monopoly ADAM SMITH , who wrote its Bible , who gave it the gospel of a free system and a free price , once said that if you should see three men of business earnestly conversing together , you might be sure they were proposing a way to limit supply and raise the price . And in his Wealth of Nations he speaks of the " manifest interest of every parlieular class of them to prevent the markets from being overstocked , as they commonly express it , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality always to keep it understoeked , " and how " each class was eager to establish regulations proper for this purpose , and , provided it was allowed to do so , was willing to consent that every other should do the same . " All in the name of the just price . " The enhancement of price , " he added , " is everywhere finally paid by the landlords , farmers and laborers of the country , who have seldom opposed the establishment of such monopolies . They have commonly neither inclination nor fitness to enter into combinations ; and the clamor and sophistry of merchants and manufacturers easily persuade them that the private interest of a part . and of a subordinate part of the society , is the general interest of the whole . " In a word , stability for the total good . A balanced economy . That was written more than 150 years ago , before railroads , steamships , electricity . Business has learned to know better . It keeps by heart the precepts and axioms of Adam Smith . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor has its inner power to resist temptation been ever heroic . In the same divided light one must regard its attitudes toward Government interference . When it speaks on this point , you might suppose it was always resolved to resist Government interference on principle , in defense of the free system . Not so . The only kind of interference it resents is a kind it does not want . Benevolent interference it welcomes . How easily , for example , did it accept the NRA code laws , that were to restrain competition , in place of the antitrust laws , that were to enforce competition  --  an exchange of the tough bread of freedom for the cake of stability . The free economic system was never in any sense invented . Certainly business would never have invented it . What happened was that a sudden onset of mechanical invention , unlike anything that had ever happened before in the experience of the human race , together with an idea of progress new in itself , opened an ern the wonder of which is still upon us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were supported by a tremendous movement of liberal political thought . The doctrine of laissez faire was embraced , and there could have been no other , for thereafter there was to be no stability but the stability of change . There was to be freedom in all dimensions . Political freedom and economic freedom were the two aspects of one thing , inseparable . The guildhall monopolies were swept away . New crafts and new trades belonging to the machine , new things , new opportunities , evolved so fast . that no policy of regulation could ( Cantinm  --  d an Page 101 ) overtake them . The destruction of old things was appalling . The handcrafts were ruined . The hand weavers put a man and his loom on a hill , in silhouette against the sky , for those to see who passed that way on the first passenger train ever moved in England . The machine was wrecking a complete and stationary world , and it was a world that had been loved , for all its wretchedness . How else was a new world to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this new world today the unemployed are better clothed , better fed , better housed , healthier , than were most of the fully employed working fourteen and sixteen hours a day in that world that was to pass ; besides , that at . least 100,000,000 human beings now live who in that other world , if it had continued , could never have been born , or , being born , could not have survived , because it would not have been possible to feed them . And how lightly now we take all that for granted At the very beginning of the modern world this was a country in the gristle . With very little that was old and rigid to be destroyed , its position was one of obvious advantage . The free system , the free price , competition as a principle and a condition  --  these were the articles of our economic faith . The Government insisted upon them ; it declared that any restraint upon competition was a sin against public policy . The statute books are strewn with laws forbidding combinations , practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where there was such a thing as a natural monopoly in fact , especially in the field of public utilities , the principle of regulation was imposed , the intent of every law of regulation being to prevent limitation of output to enhance the price . Every law either to forbid restraint of competition or to regulate a natural monopoly in private hands had to be enacted and enforced over the ominous protest of business . Nevertheless , business flourished , more here than anywhere else in the world ; and although you could think of many reasons why this should be so , still there was always one that stood unchallenged . Here the economic system was freer and competition more reckless and daring than anywhere else . The Balance of Good and Evil Booms and depressions were the consequences , both evil in themselves ; and yet if , in fact , these are evils inseparable from the workings of the free system , as they may be , then they should be weighed against the benefits , for else we might as well judge and condemn the weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has that been ? Consider , first , that there can be no meaning to the struggle , to the pain of change , to the machine , to all that may be comprehended in the term " industrial civilization , " unless it be progressively to cheapen the cost and thereby increase the availability of human satisfactions . That has happened . In the strict sense of the word , it has happened , because , with competition free , it has been uncontrolla ble . The total result has been so amazing that , although we take it all for granted , still , no one now living can imagine what it was like to live in theworld before , without plumbing , refrigeration , central heating , steamships , railroads , motor cars , aviation , electric light and electric utilities , telephone , telegraph , radio , fresh fruits and green vegetables in all seasons , white bread to the point of satiety , silk stockings or anything but homemade clothes , except for the rich . However , it never happened smoothly . A statistical line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we consume and enjoy would be a very irregular line , resembling a rude stone stairway with slanting steps of unequal depth and width . The jaggedness of this line represents the play of two forces  --  namely , the power of established business to hold an advantage for its own profit and the power of free competition to overcome it . And this may be easily explained . The Mechanics of Production There are various ways to cheapen the cost of producing our satisfactions , by mechanical energy , by arts of technology and method , by saving time , by mass production latterly , and so on ; but all of these ways come in the end to one thing  --  namely , that the productivity of human labor per man hour is increased . As the productivity of labor is increased , the cost falls , and as the cost falls , prices and wages remaining the same , the profit rises . This is the advantage business is continually striving to gain . Again and again it does gain that advantage , and yet never can it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is free . The rising profit tempts established business to expand its own capacity and at the same time attracts competitors who rush in to mob the profit . These bring new capital , build additional capacity with all new equipment and the last word of method . Among them there is competitive bidding for labor . Wages rise . Speculation appears . This is the boom . Presently the total productive capacity is so increased and the competitive pressure to sell the product becomes so great that prices crash , under the weight of what we name overproduction . This is the depression . The crash of prices means that the free system is working . What change takes place as prices fall ? It is this , that what had first been capitalized in the form of private profit  --  namely , the benefit of reducing the cost of production by enhancing the productive power of labor  --  now passes directly to the consumer . Business has been unable to keep that benefit for itself . The profit having vanished , many factories will temporarily shut up and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be lost . Banks will fail . But if the free system is permitted to go on working , there will be these further effects : First , the demand for all things will increase , or , that is to say , more of the hitherto unsatisfied demand will become effective because more people can afford to buy . Secondly , the cost of production will begin at once to fall again by the operation of three causes . The raw materials used in manufacture are cheaper since prices have fallen . That is one thing . Money wages will fall somewhat . That is the second thing . But lastly  --  and this is the important thing  --  a great EVENING POST deal of old and bubble capital will be wiped out . The capitalized value of the means of production will be sealed down , and as that occurs the fixed capital charges that lie upon production will be much less than before . Such is the step . Gradually then profit is restored on a broadened base and the things that satisfy human wants are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so fast , that in a little while the capital that was lost is quite forgotten . After a fall in prices buying power is bound to increase for two reasons . One is that the people who save and all who live by fixed incomes , such as rent , interest , and so on , will buy more . Another reason is that although money wages may fall , they fall less than prices , so that it may be , and it invariably has been , that while money wages fall real wages rise . If prices fall 30 per cent and money wages fall only 10 per cent , there is a rise in real wages ; the buying power of wages is increased . Why money wages fall less than prices is easily understood . There is organized resistance to wage reductions and none to falling prices . If , in contrast to that statistical line representing the progressive cheapening of goods by jagged steps , you should draw one to represent the rise in wages , you would see that the wage line was much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little and rising again almost at once to a higher point than before . Indeed , to see it clearly you must regard both lines together , for the statistical evidence of the cheapening of human satisfactions may appear either as a rise in wages with prices standing still , or as a fall in prices with wages standing still , or in both ways either alternately or together . None of this is theory . It . is but the history of our experience . During seventy-five years before the World War the buying power of wages , with never one serious setback , increased threefold . The Cycle Theory of Business Through 150 years of the free system this cycle as described had occurred so often that we knew the pattern very well . We had written a kind of precision literature about it , under the general title of the cycle theory of business . Then it was occurring again , on a very much greater scale than ever before , because all the parts were greater . During the ten or twelve years preceding the last price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology to production were so magnificent that we began to speak of the second industrial revolution . There was a constant pilgrimage of industrialists , bankers , statesmen and labor leaders from all over the world to see how we did it .. Our high standard of living  --  the highest to which one people had ever attained  --  was so envied that the accounts of it caused serious political unrest in other countries . Our methods and ideas were carried abroad to be imitated , and the phrase " rationalization of industry , " meaning " do it like the Americans , " was heard everywhere in Europe . Again , you see , the cost of producing the things that satisfy human wants had been cheapened , and more , perhaps , than ever before in a comparable period of time . Again , for that reason , profits were very high , and again , because of the high profit , capacity was expanded in a competitive manner , not only here but in Europe , in Asia , all over the world , in imitation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by everything we know of the cycle pattern , a terrific fall of prices was indicated . Why ? In order that the benefits of cheapened production , especially the benefits of the increased productivity of labor , should be passed on to the consumer ; or , to mean the same thing , in order that an unsatisfied demand equal to our enormously increased power of production should become effective . Likewise indicated at the same time was a terrific loss of capital , or , that is again to say , a revaluation of the capitalized means of production . Just then , of course , nearly everybody was self-persuaded that for once it would not happen . Stability had been achieved ; this profit would go on forever , and Wall Street conducted itself by that delusion . Nevertheless , it was inevitable and did happen . It was not the system that failed . The system was working in a relentless manner . It was only our intelligence that failed . The Hand of Government But when it had happened , when prices had fallen headlong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were almost through the bad part of the cycle , one of the very strange events in our history occurred . The Government and business , for opposite reasons , struck hands on a policy of limitation . In the name of the New Deal they formed a partnership to limit production , to restrain competition and to restore prices by artificial means . Suddenly and without debate , there was the end of the free economic system . The idea that controlled the mind of Government was so to re-create the economic scheme as to bring back the old forgotten blessing of stability , to banish and forbid cyclical storms , on the ground that they were socially intolerable , and , in place of what it called the anarchy and cannibalism of the free system , to substitute an order of planned economy and balanced production , with no more ruinous surplus to destroy the fair price . The idea of business , as you may suppose , was very simple : to see prices rise again , to be able , in collaboration with the Government , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inflated capital as had not already been wiped on t . And as it was in the time of Elizabeth , when business , in the shape of the honorable body of licensed weavers and the honorable body of licensed soapmakers and various honorable bodies of licensed artificers and traders , was continually going to the crown for regulations to limit apprenticeship lest the guild monopolies be injured by a surplus of practitioners , or to restrain chiselers , who were any that refused to respect the just price , so now again business , represented by the code authority for textiles or the code authority for coats and suits or the code authority for steel or buttons , looks to the Government to guarantee everybody the fair price and to exercise for that purpose its power to limit output and control competition . It is suggested that this new policy , shall have international extension , either on the initiative of the Government or on the initiative of business . An instance of the former kind is the thought of the AAA to bring about an international agreement to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited the American crop . An idea of the latter kind may be taken ( Continued en Page 204 ) ( Continued from Pape 1027 ? at random From the newspapers , as , for example , an interuational plan to save the shipping industry ? for its own good , to be sure , and yet for the good also of all associated industries in all of the twenty-five maritime countries concerned . The plan is that the twenty-five governments shall collect special tonnage dues on every ship that enters port , and the money so collected shall constitute a fund out of which shipowners shall be paid to withdraw from service and to tie up the ships that do not pay . Then there will be no surplus of ships tramping the seas and shippers may have the pleasure of paying rates such as the shipowners deem to be fair . Except that it is international and that it happens to be ships , the idea is the same as for the American Government . to collect from consumers a special tax , the money so collected to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or , that is to say , for not producing a surplus of cotton , wheat , corn , hogs , tobacco , rice , and so on , Who built the ships ? Private persons and private corporations built them . They built , as they say , too many . What shall be clone about it. ? Implemental Forms of Wealth A ship is one of the many implemental forms of wealth , and what is true of one form is true of every other form in the sense that follows . The first interest of society in the ship is that it shall produce transportation ; and it has a right to expect that it will produce transportation , because , under the free economic system , any private person or corporation possessing the capital is free to command the materials and the labor necessary to create a ship , so that you have a ship in place of any other implemental form of wealth that might have been created with the same amount of materials and labor . In the exercise of this free right the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suppose the ship does not pay , owing to the competition of many private persons and private corporations doing the same thing . The owner , therefore , is unable to make a profit on his capital . What then ? Well , in that case he may break the ship up or tie it up at his own risk ; he may write away as much of its value as represents the disappointed expectation of profit and go on with it ; he may sell it at a loss and be done with it ; he may turn it over to his creditors , who , if they can not make it pay , may , in their turn , put it on the auction block and sell it to someone who , if he buys it cheaply enough , is certain to make it pay . But in no case , under the free system , is it permitted that one who has created an unprofitable ship in place of all the other things that might have been created with the same amount of labor and material shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and save himself from loss by making the shipper pay him not to operate the ship . But that is the new way of thinking . A policy of limitation will work . It did work for many centuries , though while it worked progress in wealth and common well-being was very slow . We can not now imagine what poverty was like 200 years ago . But n policy of limitation together with the idea of progressive division presents a difficulty in reason before which the common sense stands helpless . What is it to be divided ? Call it wealth , buying power , income , or what you like ; but there are only to be divided the things that satisfy human wants , such as , first , sustenance , housing , clothing and comforts , then luxuries , recreations , entertainment and ornament ; and all these are produced by the hand , the mind , the imagination and the spirit , acting on the resources of the environment . Do you miss capital ? But capital is only what has been saved from preceding exertions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit . Capital exists in the implemental forms of wealth , and these can not be divided . You can not divide , for example , a railroad . It is an implement for producing transportation ; the transportation is divisible . You can not divide a textile mill , only the cloth ; nor an automobile plant , only the automobiles . The procedures of division are two , one economic and one political . Economic division is current , so much for the hand , so much for the mind , variable rewards for the imagination and spirit , all according to a customary scale . There is much higgling over the terms , the hand always demanding more , and both the hand and the mind often uniting to complain of the rewards that go to the imagination and spirit where these represent such things as discovery . pre-empted advantage , enterprise and capital . In consequence of the higgling , the customary scale is always changing . This is the strife and bargaining over terms of division in a free economic scheme . There is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But there is no human experience with political division tending even slightly to indicate that people will ever be content with its terms or cease from quarreling about them bitterly . The Philosophy of Labor For a long time economic division was the only procedure we knew in this country , and until a very recent time no part of society more insisted upon it than organized labor . No matter how bitter might be its conflict with capital , no matter how dissatisfied it might be with the terms of division , nevertheless , it resented welfare work , any sentimental interference , utterly rejected the idea of social service , and was willing to fight against unemployment insurance , saying  --  what was true  --  that all such benefits as these represented a political wage . It did not want a political wage . It wanted only a fair economic , wage , and in a thousand ways it said : " The transactions between labor and capital are economic , not political . Labor does not want to be uplifted and it does not want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Give it that and it will do what it likes with the wage it receives . It will attend to its own welfare , support its own old age , insure itself , lift its own standard of Living , and if it does not do these things for itself out of a fair economic wage , still that is its own business . " With that philosophy it passed through every cyclical storm before this one . That was the philosophy that enabled it to embrace the American idea of unhindered , unlimited production , thereby breaking with traditions of Old World trade unionism ; and when it could embrace that idea , then for the first time it was possible to destroy in this country the European doctrine of a limited wage fund . That doctrine was that wages were paid out of capital , wherefore there Was a line above which wages could not go without devouring capital . We perceived the simple fact that wages are not paid out of capital . They are paid out of production . It follows logically that the only limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise to any point , provided production be correspondingly increased . That . was a truth that capital and labor in other countries were never quite able to seize together . It was ours . By acting upon it we liberated production from the last of its restraints , which had been an imaginary one of classic economic dogma . The effects were  --  one , as already given , that in seventy-five years the buying power of wages increased threefold ; two , that we reached the highest standard of common living ever known , and three , that we became the paramount power of the world . All that time , of course , the unit labor cost of manufac ture was falling because the productivity of labor per man hour was rising , and rising even faster than wages . The difference was profit . Then political division . Its procedures are indefinite and unsettled . This is so because there is no customary scale . That is one reason . Another reason is that in a common effort to increase the division  --  for that purpose and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motives are extremely different . Thus , politicians whose social ideals are very dim , but who perceive the opportunity to buy public favor with public funds , walk in the halo with those whose zeal for social service is deep , religious , economically irresponsible . These may despise the politician , and yet they will exploit him for ends that justify the means . A third reason is that with the extraordinary rise in the last twenty-five years of what Frances Taussig , president of the American Association of Social Workers , in her annual report for 1932 , referred to as the social-service industry , the public conscience has been enlarged . Poverty 's New Lexicon Aspects of poverty that were common a generation ago are no longer endurable . Standards of minimum relief have been rising . Notions of the responsibilities of the state to the individual have been made over . Even the terminology has been changing . Such words as " charity , " " philanthropy " and " benevolence " are vanishing and we hardly miss them ; such as pauper , " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and city boards charged with the care of the poor , the delinquents , the ineffective and the unfit , have erased from their doors the hateful legend , " Charities and Corrections , " substituting for it the more friendly and sympathetic one , " Public Welfare , " and the trained social workers inside speak not of applicants for relief but of " clients . " Thus the stigma of applying to a public source for aid has been almost removed , as was intended . Moral responsibility for human distress  --  in theory , at least  --  is transferred from the individual to society . In that way arises in the mind of the individual a sense of right to receive relief , and at length a sense of vested interest in that right . The words " public welfare " have come to have a precise , special meaning , insisted upon by social workers . They no longer mean the common good or the common weal , as for so long " general welfare " in the preamble of the Constitution was understood . Public welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are entitled to demand and to receive from society beyond what . they are able to provide for themselves by their own exertions , enough more to give them- a minimum standard of decent living . This might go rather far and still not represent political division . A line to mark the distinction between public-welfare activities charged to the public funds and political division is at first not easy to draw . There is a debatable zone . The Rise of a Profession A society , like a large family , is bound to have a fringe of dependents , physical and mental defectives , the very old and the very young in helpless circumstances , the victims of disease , calamity and sudden economic change , and the incorrigible poor . No civilized society entirely neglects its dependents . In a poor society the only semblance of organized charity may be the church , with almsgiving as an act of the private conscience , moved by the sight of human misery . The royal conscience comes next , when every royal house has its almoner . Private philanthropy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rich conscience , is a later phase , appearing as the wealth of society increases . In this country , private philanthropy assumed enormous proportions . Twenty of the large philanthropic foundations created between 1900 and 1930 had total assets of 4858,000,000 . All these foundations were meant to confer upon people cultural and material benefits such as they were supposed to be unable to confer upon themselves . To administer their affairs a personnel had to be created and trained , and from this necessity arose a profession hitherto unheard of  --  namely , the profession of social service  --  bringing theory , research , imagination , and , of course , a strong professional bias to bear upon social problems , particularly , at first , the immemorial problems of poverty , disease and crime , and then on to those that appear in the inequalities of social and economic life under modern conditions . This new profession , with its own schools , its own scientific methods , its own predetermined point of view , and , presently , a wonderfully ramified organization , appealing always to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unselfish , came to have an irresistible political significance . Not only was it always on the popular side  --  and that was what counted with the politician  --  but its own motives were never to be questioned . Besides acting directly upon human distress so far as the means of private philanthropy would permit , it acted also , by earnest and ceaseless propaganda , upon the public conscience in order to move social legislation and put welfare activities upon the broader , richer base of public funds . As the public conscience increasingly adopted welfare activities , and with the rise of social legislation , first the cities , then the state governments , and at length the Federal Government were all in need of trained social workers , and these the profession stood ready to provide , having trained them in its own schools as part of its work . Thus the profession began to pass from social-service work to public-welfare work , taking its point of view along . Social-service work is financed by private funds ; public-welfare work is financed // by the taxpayer . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social legislation that began after 1900 , the profession exhibited true political sagacity . Always its ideas were ahead of its demands , but it insisted only on what Was possible at a given time , and then , having made a notable advance in one place , it would set tlia t up as a standard with which to shame other cities and other states . Auxiliary school services , recreation for children , mass entertainment for adults , clinics , public nursing , maternity and child hygiene , mental hygiene , day nurseries , widows ' pensions , employment and vocational guidance  --  such as these were the entering forms of social legislation . Some of them undoubtedly partake of the character of political wages . This term , " political wage , " is in the terminology , and means that to the economic wage that people have earned for themselves there is to be added the value of comforts , ministrations and various satisfactions provided at public expense . Call it a political wage and yet you have not arrived at political division , really . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assenting , and a. rich society in which the production of divisible things is free and rising may well afford very large expenditures to ameliorate human misery , simply as such . Where then does political division begin ? It begins when it is proposed in the name of public welfare to act not upon the unequal consequences of life , with ameliorative intent , but upon the conditions of life . Naturally , the profession of social service , with its thought of founding a science , would give much study to the causes of human deficiency and destitution . It has considered heredity , physical and mental health. , environment and economic conditions , with shifting emphasis ; but latterly , and especially since the depression , it has stressed beyond any other the economic cause , and from doing so , a fixed point of view has been established . The great cause of human distress is the bad distribution of wealth . There are inequalities in the nature of life , to be sure , but these are intensified by the economic inequalities , and the economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Give the people more and there will be less poverty ; give them enough and there will be no poverty at all . And since economic division has not produced that result , the recourse must be to political division . The Intricate Machinery of Relief This is the conclusion that may be said now to dominate the mentality of government ; it was brought to government by the profession . Under the sudden necessity to administer public relief on a scale never before contemplated , owing to the magnitude of the depression that began in 1929 , first again the cities , then the states , and at length the Federal Government were obliged to call upon the profession of social service for advice , personnel , experience and executive ability . Only the profession knew how , Its services have been invaluable . Administration of emergency relief has been , on the whole , an extremely fine performance . And yet , from the beginning it has been complicated by the ideas of wealth and its proper division that the profession brought with it and implanted throughout t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency unemployment relief , as to say , " How much fat have we got to live on and how far can we make it go ? " To the contrary , it has been assumed that the amount of fat was unlimited , or that , in any ease , it was nothing to worry about , for if a good deal of lean got divided with the fat , so much the better . The depression , in fact , has been treated by the profession ae an opportunity to give political effect to its conviction that social welfare requires a redistribution of wealth . hence its disposition to push the standards of emergency relief higher . Hence , in the beginning , on public-relief works , a scale of wages higher than the customary local scale , which was to use relief as a leverage to raise wages ; and that , obviously , during an emergency , was a reckless waste of fat . The Bread.and , Sugar Line Never since the beginning of the New Deal has the administration of emergency unemployment relief been free of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of achieving recovery and economic reform together . This duality of purpose appeared very clearly in the original wording of the great work-relief bill as Congress received it in January from the pen of the Administration . Concerning the incredible sum of $4,800,000,000 to be placed in the hands of the President , the words were that he should spend it not only to provide " relief from the hardships attributable to widespread unemployment , " but also to relieve " economic maladjustments , " and to improve " living and working conditions . " Congress debated how it might edit the words . That was all it could think of to do . The unlimited expectations that are raised can not be edited ; and if ever they have to be disappointed that will be very difficult to explain to people who could so easily entertain them . Compare what the individual has now the right to expect from government with what one still living and not yet old was born to expect . Formerly the things you had a right individually to expect from government were few and simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the maintenance of order , defense against the aggression of foreign enemies , and charity in eases of extreme physical need , with even then a stigma to it . Then , as the country grew very much richer and when the standard of common living had risen to the highest point over known , the individual might expect that the consequences to himself and to his family of his own deficiencies , moral , physical or economic , provided only they were bad enough , would be mitigated by aid and comfort from the public funds , because a sensitive public conscience had put a limit to poverty . There was a floor through which the individual must not be permitted to sink . The profession of social service was never content with the level of the floor . Then it became dissatisfied with the idea of a floor at all , and moved to the modern conclusion . Human misery is the first concern of government . Misery is from deficiency . Therefore , it is the Government 's business to fill all the cups of deficiency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be necessary from the cups that are full , self-filling and running over . Such now is the undertaking . Ml those who are underprivileged , says the President , shall be effectively lifted up ; those who are overprivileged shall be weeded out . The old , old inequalities shall be reduced . Those who have pitched upon poor ground shall be moved to good ground . The Government will do it . Those who live in wretched houses shall have better ones . The Government will provide them . Those who can not pay the interest on their mortgages may expect the Government to save them from foreclosure . Those who owe more than they can pay may expect the Government to ease them of their debts . Those who stand at an economic disadvantage may expect the Government to equalize them . Those who are economically maladjusted may expect the Government to readjust them . Those in whom thrift is not a habit need not worry about it .. They may expect the Government to practice thrift for them . Was it for a rainy day ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for those who lose their jobs the Government will provide jobs on public works . Was it for the support of the dependent old that one would have saved ? These shall be neither a burden any more nor go to the poorhouse . The Government will support the aged on pension , not because they may be destitute but because they are old . Nor need those who are still young worry about their own old age and deprive themselves of present enjoyments in order to put by for it ; the Government will do the putting by for them . And at last , what you have a right to expect from government is complete , insured economic security . If the Government can not remove the hazards and vicissitudes of life and living , still you may expect it to protect you from them . The Dilemma to Come But what will happen when we face the dilemma of having to satisfy unlimited expectations out of limited possibilities ? Suppose it were true that if the hazards and vicissitudes of life could be removed the need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can not be removed all schemes of insurance will be delusive . The great practical weakness of political division is that it has no relation whatever to production . It is governed by twoassumptions  --  namely , first , that under the free economic system there has taken place a vast , unprecedented concentration of wealth in a few hands ; and second , that this The two M. P. 's eyed Lieutenant Drowne 's red boots askance . A pair of boots like that meant an officer from G. H. Q. at least . " All this place around here is called La Cense , sir , " offered one of the M , P. 's . " There 's millions o ' these little roads do n't go nowheres ! " " Would it be the outfit down by the jerry howitzers ? " the other asked his companion . " Might be . What a bunch o ' johns ! The skipper come down here this concentration of wealth is the cause of economic and social inequalities . Then follows the conclusion . By casting down the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole , can be made richer and happier . Ask again what it is that may be divided . Not those peaks . They represent ownership of the implemental forms of wealth , and these are not divisible . Only the product is divisible . And it is the first natural law or capitalism that unless those privately owned implemental forms of wealth continuously perform the function of increasing the output of human satisfactions they become worthless and there is no profit in owning them . Under the feudal system the lord and his retinue could directly consume the surplus product of labor ; they did not have to sell it . In that scheme , labor might have been held forever at a bare subsistence level , yielding the whole of its surplus to the castle . In the modern capitalistic scheme the owners of the implemental forms of wealth can not consume the product . They must sell it . They must sell it to those whose labor produced it . Therefore , the increasing surplus product of labor must be increasingly divided with labor . Shareholders In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices and money it may transfer buying power from one economic group to another ; it may destroy profit. ; it may deliver to labor the whole product of divisible things ; yet these measures produce nothing , and unless production be increased , it is impossible to divide more . Any illusion to the contrary will mean only that we are devouring unawares the implemental forms of wealth , which is what happens when we consume the whole of their product and let them wear out . In the feudal scheme , if labor had been able to divide with itself the whole of its product. , only the castle would have starved . In the modern scheme , a progressive division of divisible things by political means , with no corresponding increase of production , can lead only to common disaster . How shall production keep pace ? Suppose all limitations were cast off . Still could production keep pace with the expectations that run wildly ahead of political division ? How significant that when the social-security bill was introduced in Congress in January , it was already disappointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though the security might be there , it was not rich enough . And this in a country that is not yet out of physical touch with its pioneer tradition of jealous self-helpfulness. morning , askin ' would we go up and guard them guns for ' em . There 's a coupla batteries the Boche could n't get out up there . You might ask , sir . If they was n't the right one , they might know where the other one was . " " How far away are they ? " asked Drowne , eying the woodland track with distaste . It was not at all improbable that there might be Germans down that road as well as Americans . " About five minutes , sir . The loo-tenant want me to go with him ? "
