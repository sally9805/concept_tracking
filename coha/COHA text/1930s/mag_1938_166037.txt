Los Angeles last week celebrated the homecoming of Douglas Gorce Corrigan , who few months before left a workaday mechanic 's job to flivver off into the sky , blarneyed his way to Dublin and back and became the most fabulous escapist of his time . Back down from the sky , he came , after a triumphal tour of 44 cheering cities , looking as modest as Lindbergh , when he stepped out of his little ship at Glendale airport . <P> But then strange things started to happen . " Drive slower , so everybody can see , " the chauffeur heard Corrigan say as the procession started for City Hall . When the welcoming parade was over , Douglas Corrigan had his appraisal ready : " What ? . . . only two hours and fifteen minutes . ... In Kansas City the parade was two hours and forty minutes . " Down at the Hall Corrigan got a shiny gold medal . " This is a pretty good medal , " he vouchsafed to Mayor Frank L. Shaw . Then he added : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real surprise came during a mass interview in the Ambassador Hotel , where Douglas Corrigan was assigned a double suite with no less a roomie than Governor Frank F. Merriam . While Governor Merriam took phone calls ( " Mr. Corrigan 's suite . Mr. Merriam speaking . . . . " ) , Douglas Corrigan admonished woolgathering reporters to listen more sharply and hold their tongues , refused to repeat answers to questions . When the ticklish interview was over , Reporter Agness Underwood of the Herald &; Express ducked into Corrigan 's half of the suite to telephone her story in time for her paper 's next edition . " Who 's that in my room ? " growled Corrigan like all three bears . American Airlines Pressagent Carl Anderson , whose employers squired Corrigan 's tour , told him . " Well , get her out , " said Corrigan . Pressagent Anderson tried to explain . " Listen here , you , " barked Corrigan , " when I tell you to do something , you jump . " Anderson fetched Miss Underwood away from Corrigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for reelection this fall , came to the rescue . " Little lady , " said he , " you may use my phone any time you wish . " <P> Later that afternoon , Hero Corrigan headed another parade , this one for school children . It was during this that close observers got their widest eye-opener . One part of the line of march led through a barren stretch along Western Avenue . Perched on the folded top of the official car sat Corrigan , bowing grandly right and left and not a soul on the sidewalks to bow to . <P> Next day , Corrigan made a few public cracks about his parson uncle , the Rev. S. Fraser Langford . Stories about him " teaching me navigation and me living in his home are a lot of hooey . . . . The guy . . . started sending me cables to appear in ... night clubs , . . . and him a preacher , at that . " Day later , at San Francisco City Hall , beside Mayor Angelo Rossi , he noted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Casey , Murphy , Reilly ) : " . . . From the names ... I figured I was back in Ireland . And here I always thought you were all Eyetalians up here . " The crowd tittered uncertainly , then Corrigan said his last word : " You came to laugh at me and I came to laugh at you , so I guess we 're even . "
