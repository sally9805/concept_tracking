Kidnapped ( Twentieth Century-Fox ) . In telling this story . Robert Louis Stevenson indulged in a few frank errors . But the only far-reaching one was his foreword , saying ' ' how little I am touched by the desire of accuracy . " For from this offered inch Hollywood was bound to make an ell . The past cinema season has been pretty rough on Stevenson-adding a blonde Kozatsky dancer to the Soviet 's Treasure Island ( TIME , Jan. 31 ) , flaunting an unimagined Hollywood ingenue in a Technicolored sarong in Ebb Tide ( TIME , Nov. 29 ) - but in Kidnapped , R. L. S. takes the count . Producer Darryl F. Zanuck. the better to display a fine figure of a lass named Arleen Whelan , has shifted many of the novel 's best scenes to strange and shadowy positions , has relegated to the attic the memorable ball-and-cutlass siege of the Brig Covenant 's roundhouse , has made storied Patriot Alan Breck ( Warner Baxter ) play nursemaid . <P> Until Director H. Bruce Humberstone discovered her and took her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arleen Whelan was a Hollywood manicurist . A lithe , natural lass with Celtic charm and an unaccountable suggestion of a double chin , she was soon rumored to be David Selznick 's choice for Scarlett O'Hara . But Zanuck had already signed her . In Kidnapped her voice lacks depth , except when she is singing a Scottish ballad with Maxine Sullivan flavor . She acts as if she were not quite at home in Scotland or Hollywood . <P> As the solemn Whig lad , David Balfour of Shaws , 14-year-old Freddie Bartholomew may be a shade on the jackanapes side for those who want their Stevenson straight , but he fits this feckless Fox version . Gibbous nose aloft and in fine priggish voice , Master Freddie imparts phonetic reality to an age when Britishers wrote s 's that looked like f 's . <P> Epochal scene : Freddie , feeling his oats , winning a tussle with crabby old Uncle Ebenezer , tossing off a mug of small beer and strutting about with today-I-am-a-man cocksureness . <P> Three Comrades ( Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ) . Like many another able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this script , with Edward E. Paramore , he tried to adapt Erich Maria Remarque 's novel into a corrosive arraignment of Nazi Germany . They wrote a scene in which a poor Jew proclaimed his love for Germany , another in which a rich Jew refrained from cheating three young gentiles , a scene in which famed books , including Remarque 's , were burned by Nazis . Hays office censorship left none of these scenes in the finished picture . Much political content is removed by a camera shot of a blowing newspaper dated October 1920 , still more by removal of all definite party labels . What is left is a love story , beautifully told and consummately acted , but so drenched in hopelessness and heavy with the aroma of death , of wasted youth in a world of foggy shapes and nameless menaces , that its beauty and strength are often clouded and betrayed .
