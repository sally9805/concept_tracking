txt Wiley Post 's third attempt to crack the transcontinental airplane speed rec ? ord by way of the stratosphere ended here today when , plagued by supercharger trouble , he brought the Winnie Mae down on Purdue university airport . Streaking away from the Burbank Union air terminal at ** a. m. cago time , Post averaged 231.48 miles an hour . landing here at 3:40 p. m. , having been In the air 8 hours 123k minutes . Over this college community the sturdy ship which has set around the world marks failed him . After circling the university field four or five times Post came down on a six foot skid attached to the bottom of his plane 's fuselage in what airport attaches termed a " sweet landing . " Landing Gear Dropped . Post had dropped his landing gear just after his California takeoff to cut wind resistance to a minimum . " Get my hat off , " were Post 's first words . He was wearing a visored aluminum helmet and a 16 pound rubber fabric suit In which he received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was asked . " I do n't know , " Post replied . " I do n't want to talk about it at all . " More than 160 Purdue university students and townspeople jammed around the plane . Souvenir hunters displayed a bit of paint they had scratched off the ship . Within a short time trafic was tangled for blocks about the field . Mechanism Is Damaged . Post said a clutch on one of his superchargers was stripped . He remained at the field for some time superintending the placing of wooden skis on the wheel  --  less snip so it could be stowed into a hangar . He Indicated he would remain here awaiting arrival of landing gear to be fitted on the ship . Post told those who helped him out of his flying togs that he was somewhere between Cincinnati and Chicago when the trouble in the supercharger developed . He turned back , intending to land at Chicago , then remembered the Lafayette airport . The erstwhile Oklahoma farm boy who established two around the world marks carried no radio sending equipment in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time a his takeoff until he was forced down . Depends Upon Radio . He flew through the stratosphere at an average altitude of approximately 33,000 feet . He depended mainly on a radio receiving set for plotting his 900 mile course by tuning in broadcasting stations . The flight was designed to test the feasibility of superspeed air mall and express flights across the continent above weather disturbances . Roscoe Turner set the present west  --  cast transcontinental record of 10 hours and 2 minutes in Sept. , 1934 . Post was forced down Feb. 22 in the Mojave desert 125 miles out of Burbank by motor trouble which later he alleged was caused by sabotage . On his second attempt to set a. coast-tocoast record he came down at Cleveland because of depletion of his oxygen supply . Flying Conditions Bad . Post said flying conditions today were unusually bad . Despite a barrage of questions thrown at him con- I tinuously , he refused to comment on anything except , to say he probably would stay here for three or four days . On this trip Post carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superchargers enabled the Wasp en-1 gine to maintain its full rating of 550 horse power up to 30,000 ' feet . Above that there is a gradual failing off in power . The stratosphere , in general , is a dry rarefied layer of atmosphere within which the temperature decreases very little with increasing altitude , and there are no storms . Post believes because of this freedom from atmosphonic disturbances found at the lower levels that aviators in the future will fly to great heights to reach a maximum of efficiency . Bar Jubilee Use of King 's $16,000,000 Tableware LONDON , April ** at a state banquet in Buckinghamipalace May 6 in honor of the king 's jubilee will not eat off the king 's famous gold dinner service after all . It has been decided that the service , which with the rise in the price of gold is now worth approximately $16,000,000 , is too valuable to risk its getting scratched up . Instead it will be placed on exhibition in the banquet hall for the guests to admire while dining off more prosaic china .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
