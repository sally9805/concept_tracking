Illustration : " Wonderful ! The World 's Unparalleled Upside-Down Man ! " Disowned By Victor Endersby * * * * * Sidenote : The tragic misadventure of a man to whom the sky became an appalling abyss , drawing him ever upward . The sky sagged downward , bellying blackly with a sudden summer rain , giving me a vision of catching my train in sodden clothing after the short-cut across the fields , which I was taking in company with my brother Tristan and his fiancee . The sullen atmosphere ripped apart with an electric glare ; our ears quivered to the throbbing sky , while huge drops , jarred loose from the air by the thunder-impact , splattered sluggishly , heavily , about us . Little breezes swept out from the storm center , lifting the undersides of the long grass leaves to view in waves of lighter green . I complained peevishly . " Ah , mop up ! " said Tristan . " You 've plenty of time , and there 's the big oak ! It 's as dry under there as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun ! " twittered Alice . " To wait out a thunder-storm under a tree ! " " Under a tree ? " I said . " Hardly ! I 'm not hankering to furnish myself as an exhibit on the physiological effects of a lightning stroke -- no , sir ! " " Rats ! " said Tristan . " All that 's a fairy-tale -- trees being dangerous in a thunder-storm ! " * * * * * The rain now beat through our thin summer clothing , as Tristan seized Alice 's hand and towed her toward the spreading shelter . I followed them at first , then began to lag with an odd unwillingness . I had been only half serious in my objection , but all at once that tree exercised an odd repulsion on me ; an imaginary picture of the electric fluid coursing through my shriveling nerve-channels grew unpleasantly vivid . Suddenly I knew I was not going under that tree . I stopped dead , pulling my hat brim down behind to divert the rivulet coursing down the back of my neck , calling to the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back at me curiously , and Alice began to twit me , standing in the rain , while Tristan desired to know whether we thought we were a pair of goldfish ; in his estimation , we might belong to the piscine tribe all right , but not to that decorative branch thereof . To be frank , he used the term " suckers . " Feeling exceptionally foolish , I planted myself doggedly in the soaking grass as Alice turned to dash for the tree . Then the thing happened ; the thing which to this hour makes the fabric of space with its unknown forces seem an insecure and eery garment for the body of man . Over the slight rise beyond the tree , as the air crackled , roared and shook under the thunder-blasts , there appeared an object moving in long , leisurely bounds , drifting before the wind , and touching the ground lightly each time . It was about eighteen inches in diameter , globular , glowing with coruscating fires , red , green , and yellow ; a thing of unearthly and wholly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and shrieked at Tristan , half terrified , half elated at the sight . He wheeled quickly , there under the tree , and slowly backed away as the thing drifted in to keep him company in his shelter . We could not see his face , but there was a stiffness to his figure indicating something like fear . Suddenly things I had read rose into my memory . This was one of those objects variously called " fire-balls , " " globe-lightning , " " meteors , " and the like . I also recalled the deadly explosive potencies said to be sometimes possessed by such entities , and called out frantically : " Tristan ! Do n't touch it ! Get away quickly , but do n't disturb the air ! " He heard me and , as the object wavered about in the comparative calm under the tree , drifting closer to him , started to obey . But it suddenly approached his face , and seized with a reckless terror , he snatched off his hat and batted at it as one would at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stunning detonation , and a violent air-wave which threw me clear off my feet and to the ground . I sat up blindly with my vision full of opalescent lights and my ears ringing , unable to hear , see , or think . * * * * * Slowly my senses came back ; I saw Alice struggling upright in the grass before me . She cast a quick glance toward the tree , then , still on her knees , covered her face and shuddered . For a long time , it seemed , I gazed toward the tree without sight conveying any mental effect whatever . Quite aside from my dazed state , the thing was too bizarre ; it gave no foothold to experience for the erection of understanding . My brother 's body lay , or hung , or rested -- what term could describe it ? with his stomach across the under side of a large limb a few feet above where he had stood . He was doubled up like a hairpin , his abdomen pressed tightly up against this bough , and his arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Getting my scattered faculties and discoordinate limbs together , I made my way to the tree , the gruesome thought entering my mind that Tristan 's body had been transfixed by some downward-pointing snag as it was blown up against the limb , and that the strange stiffness of his limbs was due to some ghastly sudden rigor mortis brought on by electric shock . Dazed with horror and grief , I reached up to his clothing and pulled gently , braced for the shock of the falling body . It remained immovable against the bough . A harder tug brought no results either . Gathering up all my courage against the vision of the supposed snag tearing its rough length out of the poor flesh , I leaped up , grasping the body about chest and hips , and hung . It came loose at once , without any tearing resistance such as I had expected , but manifesting a strong elastic pull upward , as though some one were pulling it with a rope ; as I dropped back to the ground with it , the upward resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it occurred to me that his belt or some of his clothing was still caught , and I jerked sidewise to pull it loose . It did not loosen , but I found myself suddenly out from under the tree , my brother dragging upward from my arms until my toes almost left the ground . And there was obviously no connection between him and the tree -- or between him and anything else but myself , for that matter . At this I went weak ; my arms relaxed despite my will , and an incredible fact happened : I found the body sliding skyward through my futile grasp . Desperately I got my hands clasped together about his wrist , this last grip almost lifting me from the earth ; his legs and remaining arm streamed fantastically skyward . Through the haze which seemed to be finally drowning my amazed and tortured soul , I knew that my fingers were slipping through one another , and that in another instant my brother would be gone . Gone -- where ? Why and how ? * * * * * There was a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine , as Alice , whom I had quite forgotten , made a skyward running jump and clasped the arm frantically to her bosom with both her own . With vast relief , I loosed my cramped fingers -- only to feel her silken garments begin to slide skyward against my cheek . It was more instinct than sense which made me clutch at her legs . God , had I not done that ! As it was , I held both forms anchored with only a slight pull , waiting dumbly for the next move -- quite non compos by this time , I think . " Quick , Jim ! " she shrieked . " Quick , under the tree ! I ca n't hold him long ! " Very glad indeed to be told what to do , I obeyed . Under her direction we got the body under a low limb and wedged up against it , where with our feet both now on the ground , we balanced it with little effort . Feverishly , once more at her initiative , we took off our belts and strapped it firmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuddering , beneath it . The blase reader may consider that we here manifested the characters of sensitive weaklings . But let him undergo the like ! The supernatural , or seemingly so , has always had power to chill the hottest blood . And here was an invisible horror reaching out of the sky for its prey , without any of the ameliorating trite features which would temper an encounter with the alleged phenomena of ghostland . For a time we sat under that fatal tree listening to the dreary drench of rain pouring off the leaves , quivering nerve-shaken to the thunderclaps . Lacking one another , we had gone mad ; it was the beginning of a mutual dependence in the face of the unprecedented , which was to grow to something greater during the bizarre days to follow . There was no need of words for each of us to know that the other was struggling frantically for a little rational light on the outre catastrophe in which we were entangled . It never once occurred to us that my brother might still be alive -- until a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy we sprang up . He was twisting weakly in the belts , muttering deliriously . We unfastened him and pulled him to the ground , where I sat on his knees while she pressed down on his shoulders , and so kept him recumbent , both horrified at the insistent lift of his body under us . She kissed him frantically and stroked his cheeks , I feeling utterly without resource . He grew stronger , muttered wildly , and his eyes opened , staring upward through the tree limbs . He became silent , and stiffened , gazing fixedly upward with a horror in his wild blue gaze which chilled our blood . What did he see there -- what dire other-world thing dragging him into the depths of space ? Shortly his eyes closed , and he ceased to mutter . * * * * * I took his legs under my arms -- the storm was clearing now -- and we set out for home with gruesomely buoyant steps , the insistent pull remaining steady . Would it increase ? We gazed upward with terrified eyes , becoming calmer by degree as conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last field , Alice faltered : " Jim , we ca n't take him right in like this ! " I stopped . " Why not ? " " Oh , because -- because -- it 's too ridiculously awful . I do n't know just how to say it -- oh , ca n't you see it yourself ? " In a dim way , I saw it . No cultured person cares to be made a center of public interest , unless on grounds of respect . To come walking in in this fashion , buoyed balloon-like by the body of this loved one , and before the members of a frivolous , gaping house party -- ah , even I could imagine the mingled horror and derision , the hysterics among the women , perhaps . Nor would it stop there . Rumors -- and heaven only knows what distortions such rumors might undergo , having their source in the incredible -- would range our social circle like wildfire . And the newspapers , for our families are established and known -- no , it would n't go . I tied Tristan to a stile and called up Jack Briggs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Tristan had met with an accident , asked him to say nothing , and explained where to bring the machine . In ten minutes he had maneuvered the heavy sedan across the rough wet fields . And then we had another problem on our hands : to let Jack into what had happened without shocking him into uselessness . It was not until we got him to test Tristan 's eery buoyancy with his own hands that we were able to make him understand the real nature of our problem . And after that , his comments remained largely gibberish for some time . However , he was even quicker than we were to see the need for secrecy -- he had vivid visions of the political capital which opposing newspapers would make of any such occurrence at his party -- and so we arranged a plan . According to which we drove to the back of the house , explained to the curious who rushed out that Tristan had been injured by a stroke of lightning , and rushed the closely wrapped form up to his room , feeling a great relief at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack went downstairs to dismiss the party as courteously as possible , Alice and I tied my brother to the bed with trunk straps . Whereupon the bed and patient plumped lightly but decisively against the ceiling as soon as we removed our weight . While we gazed upward open mouthed , Jack returned . His faculties were recovering better than ours , probably because his affections were not so involved , and he gave the answer at once . " Ah , hell ! " said he . " Pull the damn bed down and spike it to the floor ! " This we did . Then we held a short but intense consultation . Whatever else might be the matter , obviously Tristan was suffering severely from shock and , for all we knew , maybe from partial electrocution . So we called up Dr. Grosnoff in the nearest town . * * * * * Grosnoff after our brief but disingenuous explanation , threw off the bed covers in a business-like way , then straightened up grimly . " And may I ask , " he said with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first-aid for a case of lightning stroke ? " " He was delirious , " I stammered . " Delirious my eye ! He 's as quiet as a lamb . And you 've tied him down so tightly that the straps are cutting right into him ! Of all the -- the --  " He stopped , evidently feeling words futile , and before we could make an effective attempt to stop him , whipped out a knife and cut the straps . Tristan 's unfortunate body instantly crashed against the ceiling , smashing the lathing and plaster , and remaining half embedded in the ruins . A low cry of pain rose from Alice . Dr. Grosnoff staggered to a chair and sat down , his eyes fixed on the ceiling with a steady stare -- the odd caricature of a man coolly studying an interesting phenomenon . My brother appeared to be aroused by the shock , struggling about in his embedment , and finally sat up . Up ? Down , I mean . Then he stood , on the ceiling , and began to walk ! His nose had been bruised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the blood moved slowly upward over his lip . He saw the window , and walked across the ceiling to it upside down . There he pushed the top of the window down and leaned out , gazing up into the sky with some sort of fascination . Instantly he crouched on the ceiling , hiding his eyes , while the house rang with shriek after shriek of mortal terror , speeding the packing of the parting guests . Alice seized my arm , her fingers cutting painfully into the flesh . " Jim , " she screamed . " I see it now -- do n't you ? His gravity 's all changed around -- he weighs up ! He thinks the sky 's under him ! " The human mind is so constructed that merely to name a thing oddly smooths its unwonted outlines to the grasp of the mind ; the conception of a simple reversal of my brother 's weight , I think , saved us all from the padded cell . That made it so commonplace , such an everyday sort of thing , likely to happen to anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysterious , in all truth , than that which we were now witnessing -- but we are born to it ! * * * * * Dr. Grosnoff recovered in a manner which showed considerable caliber . " Well , " he grunted , " that being the case , we 'd best be looking after him . Nervous shock , possible electric shock and electric burns , psychasthenia -- that 's going to be a long-drawn affair -- bruises , maybe a little concussion , and possibly internal injury -- that was equivalent to a ten-foot unbroken fall flat on his stomach , and I 'll never forgive myself if .... Get me a chair ! " With infinite care and reassuring words , the big doctor with our help pulled my brother down , the latter frantically begging us not to let him " fall " again . Holding him securely on the bed and trying to reassure him , Grosnoff said : " Straps and ropes wo n't do . His whole weight hangs in them -- they 'll cut him unmercifully . Take a sheet , tie the corners with ropes , and let him lie in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to the strength of this arrangement before Tristan was at comparative peace . Dr. Grosnoff effected an examination by slacking off the ropes until Tristan lay a couple of feet clear of the bed , then himself lay on the mattress face up , prodding the patient over . The examination concluded , he informed us that Tristan 's symptoms were simply those of a general physical shock such as would be expected in the case of a man standing close to the center of an explosion , though from our description of the affair he could not understand how my brother had survived at all . The glimmering of an explanation of this did not come until a long time afterward . So far as physical condition was concerned , Tristan might expect to recover fully in a matter of weeks . Mentally -- the doctor was not so sure . The boy had gone through a terrible experience , and one which was still continuing -- might continue no one knew how long . We were , said the doctor , up against a trick played by the great Sphinx , Nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had never before taken place in the history of all mankind . " There is faintly taking shape in my mind , " he said , " the beginning of a theory as to how it came about . But it is a theory having many ramifications and involving much in several lines of science , with most of which I am but little acquainted . For the present I have no more to say than that if a theory of causation can be worked out , it will be the first step toward cure . But -- it may be the only step . Do n't build hopes ! " Looking Alice and me over carefully , he gave us a each a nerve sedative and departed , leaving us with the feeling that here was a man of considerably wider learning than might be expected of a small-town doctor . In point of fact , we learned that this was the case . The specialist has been described as a " man who knows more and more about less and less . " In Dr. Grosnoff 's mind , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . " * * * * * Tristan grew stronger physically ; mentally , he was intelligent enough to help us and himself by keeping his mind as much as possible off his condition , sometimes by sheer force of will . Meantime , Dr. Grosnoff , realizing that his patient could not be kept forever tied in bed , had assisted me in preparing for his permanent care at home . The device was simple ; we had just taken his room , remodeled the ceiling as a floor , and fitted it with furniture upside down . Most of the problems involved in this were fairly simple . The matter of a bath rather stumped us for a while , until we hit upon a shower . The jets came up from under Tristan 's feet , from the point of view of his perceptions ; he told us that one of the strangest of all his experiences was to see the waste water swirl about in the pan over his head , and being sucked up the drain as though drawn by some mysterious magnet . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no servant problem to deal with . But he was going to need care as well as companionship , and I had to earn my living . For Alice , it was a case where the voice of the heart chimed with that of necessity ; and I was best man at perhaps the weirdest marriage ceremony which ever took place on this earth . Held down in bed with the roped sheet , all betraying signs carefully concealed , Tristan was married to Alice by an unsuspecting dominie who took it all for one of those ordinary , though romantic sick-bed affairs . From the first , Tristan felt better and more secure in his special quarters , and was now able to move about quite freely within his limits ; though such were his mental reactions that for his comfort we had to refinish the floor to look like a plaster ceiling , to eliminate as far as possible the upside-down suggestions left in the room , and to keep the windows closely shaded . I soon found that the sight of me , or any one else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of Alice did other considerations remove the unpleasantness . Little by little the accumulation of experience brought to my mind the full and vivid horror of what the poor lad had suffered and was suffering . Why , when he had looked out of that window into the sky , he was looking down into a bottomless abyss , from which he was sustained only by the frail plaster and planking under his feet ! The whole earth , with its trees and buildings , was suspended over his head , seemingly about to fall at any moment with him into the depths ; the sun at noon glared upward from the depths of an inferno , lighting from below the somber earth suspended overhead ! Thus the warm comfort of the sun , which has cheered the heart of man from time immemorial , now took on an unearthly , unnatural semblance . I learned that he could never quite shake off the feeling that the houses were anchored into the earth , suspended only by the embedment of their foundations in the soil ; that trees were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that soil was held to the bedrock only by its cohesion . He even dreaded lest , during storms , the grip of the muddy soil be loosened , and the fields fall into the blue ! It was only when clasped tight in Alice 's arms that the horrors wholly left him . All the reasoning we might use on his mind , or that he himself could bring to bear on it , was useless . We found that the sense of up and down is ineradicably fixed by the balancing apparatus of the body . * * * * * Meanwhile , his psychology was undergoing strange alterations ; the more I came to appreciate the actual conditions he was living under , the more apparent it seemed to me that he must have a cast-iron mental stamina to maintain sanity at all . But he not only did that ; he began to recover normal strength , and to be irked unbearably by his constant confinement . So it came about that he began to venture a little at a time from his room , wandering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , he could not yet look out of windows , but sidled up to them with averted face to draw any blinds that were up . As he grew increasingly restless , we all felt more and more that the thing could not continue as it was ; some way out must be found . We had many a talk with Grosnoff , at last inducing him to speak about the still half-formed theory which he had dimly conceived at the first . " For a good many decades , " he said , " there have been a few who regarded the close analogies between magnetism and gravitational action as symptomatic of a concealed identity between them . Einstein 's ' Field Theory ' practically proves it on the mathematical side . Now it is obvious that if gravitation is a form of magnetism -- and if so it belongs to another plane of magnetic forces than that which we know and use -- then the objects on a planet must have the opposite polarity from that of the planet itself . Since the globe is itself a magnet , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of a magnet on any plane , because then the human race would be divided into two species , each polarized in the sign opposite to its own pole ; when an individual of either race reached the equator , he would become weightless , and when he crossed it , would be repelled into space . " " Lord ! " I said . " There would be a plot for one of your scientific fiction writers ! " * * * * * " I can present you with another , " said Dr. Grosnoff . " How do we know whether another planet would have the opposite sign to our own bodies ? " " Well , " I chuckled , " they 'll find that out soon enough when the first interplanetary expedition tries to land on on of ' em ! " " Hmf ! " grunted the medico . " That 'll be the least of their troubles ! " " But you said the polarity could n't be that of a magnet ; then what ? " " Do n't you remember the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An accumulation of positive electricity repels an accumulation of negative -- if indeed we can correctly use ' accumulation ' for a negativity -- and it is my idea that the earth is the container of a gigantic accumulation of this meta -- or hyper-electricity which we are postulating ; and our bodies contain a charge of the opposite sign . " " But , Doctor , the retention of a charge of static electricity by a body in the presence of one of the opposite sign requires insulation of the containing bodies ; for instance , lightning is a breaking down of the air insulation between the ground and a cloud . In our case we are constantly in contact with the earth , and the charges would equalize . " " Please bear in mind , Jim , that we are not talking about electricity as now handled by man , but about some form of it as yet hypothetical . We do n't know what kind of insulation it would require . We may be constitutionally insulated . " " And you think the fire-ball broke down that insulation by the shock to Tristan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing was shaping up hazily , but unmistakably . " But , then , why do n't we frequently see people kiting off the earth as the result of explosions ? " " How do you know they have n't ? Do n't we have plenty of mysterious disappearances as the result of explosions , and particularly , strangely large numbers of missing in a major war ? " My blood chilled . The world was beginning to seem a pretty awful place . Grosnoff saw my disturbance , and placed a reassuring hand on my shoulder . " I 'm afraid , " he said , smiling , " that I rather yielded to the temptation to get a rise out of you . That suggestion might be unpleasantly true under special circumstances . But I particularly have an eye out for the special capacities of that weird and rare phenomenon , the fire-ball . It is n't impossible that the energy of the fire-ball went into the re-polarization rather than into a destructive concussion -- hence Tristan 's escape . " " You mean its effect is qualitatively different from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so . It is known to be an electric conglomeration of some kind -- but that 's all . " * * * * * Meantime circumstances were not going well with us ; the financial burden of Tristan 's support , added to the strain of the situation , was becoming overwhelming . Tristan knew this and felt it keenly ; this brought him to a momentous decision . He looked down at us from the ceiling one day with an expression of unusual tenseness , and announced that he was going out permanently , and to take part in the world again . " I 've gotten now so that I can bear to look out of the windows quite well . It 's only a matter of time and practise until I can stand the open . After all , it is n't any worse than being a steel worker or steeplejack . Even if the worst came to the worst , I 'd rather be burst open by the frozen vacuum of interstellar space than to splash upon a sidewalk before an admiring populace -- and people do that every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed great delight . His patient was coming along well mentally , at least . Alice sat down , trembling . " But , good Lord , Tristan , " I said , " what possible occupation could you follow ? " " Oh , I 've brooded over that for weeks , and I 've crossed the Rubicon . I think we 're a long way past such petty things as personal pride . Did it ever occur to you that what from one point of view is a monstrous catastrophe , from another is an asset ? " " What in the dickens are you talking about ? " I asked . " I 'm talking about the -- the --  " he gulped painfully --  " the stage . " Alice wrung her hands , crying bitterly : " Wonderful ! Splendid ! Tristan LeHuber , The World 's Unparalleled Upside-Down Man ! He Does n't Know Whether He 's On His Head Or His Heels . He 's Always Up In The Air About Something , But You Ca n't Upset Him ! Vaudeville To-night -- The Bodongo Brothers , Brilliant Burmese Balancers -- Arctic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LeHuber , The Balloon Man -- He Uses An Anchor For A Parachute ! " At last indeed the LeHuber family will have arrived sensationally in the public eye ! " There are , " Alice raved , " two billion people on the earth to-day . Counting three generations per century , there have been about twelve billion of us in the last two hundred years . And out of all those , and all the millions and billions before that , we had to be picked for this loathsome cosmic joke -- just little us for all that distinction ! Why , oh , why ? If our romance had to be spoiled by a tragedy smeared across the billboards of notoriety , why could n't it have been in some decent , human sort of way ? Why this ghastly absurdity ? " " From time immemorial , " said Grosnoff , " there have been men who sought to excite the admiration of their fellows , to get themselves worshiped , to dominate , to collect perquisites , by developing some wonderful personal power or another . From Icarus on down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ecstatics of medieval times , the Hindu Yogis , even the day-dreaming schoolboy , have had visions of floating in air before the astounding multitudes by a mere act of will . The frequency of ' flying dreams ' may indicate such a thing as a possibility in nature . Tradition says many have accomplished it . If so , it was by a reversal of polarity through an act of will . Those who did it -- Yogis -- believed in successive lives on earth . If they were right about the one , why not the other ? Suppose one who had developed that power of will , carried it to another birth , where it lay dormant in the subconscious until set off uncontrolled by some special shock ? " Alice paled . " Then Tristan might have been --  " " He might . Then again , maybe my brain is addled by this thing . In any case , the moral is : do n't monkey with Nature ! She 's particular . " * * * * * Tristan 's vaudeville scheme was not as easily realized as said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skeptical in spite of Tristan 's appearance standing upside down in stilts heavily weighted at the ground ends ; and even after his resistance was broken down in a manner which left him gasping and a little woozy , began to reason unfavorably in a hard-headed way . Audiences , he explained , were off levitation acts . Too old . No matter what you did , they 'd lay it to concealed wires , and yawn . Even if you called a committee from the audience , the committee itself would merely be sore at not being able to solve the trick ; the audience would consider the committee a fake or merely dumb . And all that would take too much time for an act of that kind . " Oh , yeh , I know ! It 's got me goin ' , all right . But I ca n't think like me about this sorta thing . I got to think like the audience does -- or go outa business ! " After which solid but unprofitable lesson in psychology , we dropped the last vestige of pride and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Nah , the rubes do n't wear celluloid collars any more . Ya ca n't slip any wire tricks over on ' em ! " " But he can do this in a big topless tent , or even out in an open field , if you like . " " Nope -- steel rods run up the middle of a rope has been done before . " " Steel rods in a rope which the people see uncoil from the ground in front of their eyes ? " " Well , they 'd think of somethin ' else , then . I 'm tellin ' ya , it wo n't go ! Sure , people like to be fooled , but they want it to be done right ! " " Yes ! " I sneered . " And a hell of a lot of people have fooled themselves right about this matter , too ! " He looked at me curiously . " Say , have ya really got somethin ' up y'r sleeve ? " " You 'd be surprised ! " Thus he grudgingly gave us a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But on thinking it over , he decided like the vaudeville man . " Listen ! " said Tristan suddenly , in a voice of desperation . " I 'll do a parachute jump into the sky , and land on an airplane ! " " Tristan ! " shrieked Alice , in horror . The circus man nearly lost his cigar , then bit it in two . " Sa-ay -- what the -- I 'll call that right now ! I 'll get ya the plane and chute if y 'll put up a deposit to cover the cost . If ya do it , we 'll have the best money in the tents ; if ya do n't , I keep the money ! " " If I do n't , " said Tristan distinctly , " I 'll have not the slightest need for the money . " But the airplane idea was out ; we could think of no way for him to make the landing on such a swiftly-moving vehicle . Again Alice solved it . " If you absolutely must break my heart and put me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blimp ! " Of course ! And that is what we did -- on the first attempt coming unpleasantly close to doing just that to Alice . * * * * * The blimp captain was obviously skeptical , and betrayed signs of a peeve at having his machine hired for a hoax ; but money was money and he agreed to obey our instructions meticulously . His tone was perfunctory , however , despite my desperate attempts to impress him with the seriousness of the matter ; and that nonchalance of his came near to having dire consequences . The captain was supplied with a sort of boat-hook with instructions to steer his course to reach the parachute ropes as it passed him on its upward flight . And he was seriously warned of the fact that , after the chute reached two or three thousand feet , its speed would increase because of the rarefaction of the air ; and in case of a miss , it would become constantly harder to overtake . These directions he received with a scornful half smile ; obviously he never expected to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circling overhead , Tristan upside down in his seat suspended skyward , a desperately grim look on his face ; and Alice almost in collapse . We were all spared the agony of several hundred feet of unbroken fall ; the parachute was open on the ground , and rose at a leisurely speed , but too fast at that for the comfort of any of us . I do n't think the wondering crowd and the dumbfounded circus people ever saw a stranger sight than that chute drifting upward into the blue . We heard nothing of " hidden wires , " then or ever after ! The white circle grew pitifully small and forlorn against the fathomless azure ; and suddenly we noticed that the blimp seemed to be merely drifting with the wind , making no attempt to get under -- or over -- Tristan . Our hearts labored painfully . Had the engines broken down ? Alice buried her face against my sleeve with a moan . " I ca n't look ... tell me ! " I tried to -- in a voice which I vainly tried to make steady . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that its crew of three , captain included , had been so completely paralyzed by the reality of the event that they had forgotten what they were there for until almost too late . Now we heard the high note of its overdriven engines as it rolled and rocked toward the rising chute . For a moment the white spot showed against its gray side , then tossed and pitched wildly in the wake of the propellers as , driven too hastily and frenziedly , the ship overshot its mark and the captain missed his grab . * * * * * I could only squeeze Alice tightly and choke as the aerial objects parted company and the blue gap between them widened . Instantly , avid to retrieve his mistake , the captain swung his craft in a wild careen around and a spiral upward . But he tried to do too many things at a time -- make too much altitude and headway both at once . The blimp pitched steeply upward to a standstill , barely moving toward the parachute . Quickly it sloped downward again and gathered speed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upward on its momentum . Mistake number three ! He had waited too long before using his elevator ; and the chute fled hopelessly away just ahead of the uptilted nose of the blimp . I could only moan , and Alice made no sound or movement . Next we saw the blimp 's water ballast streaming earthward in the sun , and it was put into a long , steady spiral in pursuit of the parachute , whose speed -- or so it seemed to my agonized gaze -- was now noticeably on the increase . The altitude seemed appallingly great ; the blimp 's ceiling , I knew , was only about twenty thousand ; and my brother , even if not frozen to death by that time , would be traveling far faster then than any climbing speed the blimp could make ; as his fall increased in speed , the climb of the bag decreased . At last , with a quiver of renewed hope , I saw the blimp narrowing down its spirals -- it was overtaking ! Smaller and smaller grew both objects -- but so did the gap between them ! At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little gray minnow . In one long agony I waited to see whether the gap would open out again . Lord of Hosts -- the blimp was slanting steeply downward ; the parachute had vanished ! Then at last I paid some attention to the totally limp form in my arms ; and a few minutes later , amid an insane crowd , a pitifully embarrassed and nerve-shaken dirigible navigator was helping me lift my heavily-wrapped , shivering brother from the gondola , while the mechanics turned their attention to the overdriven engines and wracked framing . Did I say " helping me lift ? " Such is the force of habit -- but verily , a new nomenclature would have to come into being to deal adequately with such a life as my poor brother 's ! Tristan seized my hand . " Jim ! " he said through chattering teeth , " I 'm cured -- cured of the awful fear ! That second time he missed , I just gave up entirely ; I did n't care any longer . And then somehow I felt such a sense of peace and freedom -- there were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of insecurity . I just was , in a great blue quiet ; it was n't like falling at all ; no awful shock to meet , no sickness or pain -- just quietly floating along from Here to There , with no particular dividing line between , anywhere . The cold hurt , of course , but somehow it did n't seem to matter , and was getting better when they caught me . But now -- I can do things you never even imagined ! " * * * * * Thus began my brother 's real public career -- he had arrived . After that he was able to name his own compensation , and shortly during his tours , began to sport a private dirigible of his own , which he often used for jumps between stands . He told me jokingly that it was very fitting transportation for him , as his hundred and sixty pound lift saved quite a bit of expense for helium ! He developed an astonishing set of tricks . After the jump , he would arrive on the field suspended above the dirigible doing trapeze tricks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go through some more of them , with a few hair raisers of his own invention , one of which consisted of apparently letting go the rope by accident and shooting skyward with a wild shriek , only to be caught at the end of a fine , especially woven piano wire cable attached to a spring safety belt , the cable being in turn fastened into the end of the rope . Needless to say , Alice was unable to wax enthusiastic about any of these feats , though she loyally accompanied him in his travels . She would sit in the tent gazing at him with a horrible fascination , and month by month grew thinner and more strained . Tristan felt her stress deeply ; but was making money so fast that we all felt that in a short time , if not able to finance the discovery of a cure , at least he could retire and live a safer life . And he found his ideal haven of rest -- in a Pennsylvania coal mine ! Thus , the project grew in his mind , of buying an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters , environed with fungus gardens , air ferns and the like , plants which could be trained to grow upside down ; he emerging only for necessary sun baths . As time went on , I really grew accustomed to the situation , though seeing less and less of Tristan and Alice ; during summers they were on tour , and in winter were quartered in Tristan 's coal mine , which had become a reality . So one summer day when the circus stopped at a small town where I was taking vacation , I was overjoyed at the opportunity to see them . I timed myself to get there as the afternoon performance was over , but arrived a little early , and went on into the untopped tent . Tristan waved an inverted greeting at me from his poise on his trapeze , and I watched for a few minutes . There was an odd mood about the crowd that day , largely due to a group of loud-mouthed hill-billies from the back country -- the sort which is so ignorant as to live in perpetual fear of getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is told , looking for something ulterior behind every exterior . Having duly exposed to their own satisfaction the strong man 's " wooden dumbbells , " the snake charmer 's rubber serpents , the fat woman 's pillows , and the bearded lady 's false whiskers ( I do n't know what they did about the living skeleton ) , these fellows were now gaping before Tristan 's platform , and growing hostile as their rather inadequate brains failed to cook up any damaging explanation . " Yah ! " yelled a long-necked , flap-eared youth , suddenly . " He 's got an iron bar in that rope ! " They had come too late to see the parachute drop . Tristan grinned and pulled himself down the rope , which of course fell limp behind him . At this , the crowd jeered and booed the too-hasty youth , who became so resentfully abusive of Tristan that one of the attendants pushed him out of the tent . As he passed me , I caught fragments of wrathy words : " Wisht I had a ... Show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * * Tristan closed his act by dropping full-length to the end of his invisible wire , then pulled himself down , got into his stilts , and was unfastening the belt , when the manager rushed in with a request that he repeat , for the benefit of a special party just arrived on a delayed train . " Go on and look at the animals , old man . " Tristan called to me . " I 'll be with you in about half an hour ! " I strolled out idly , meeting on the way the flap-eared youth , who seemed bent on making his way back into the tent , wearing a mingled air of furtiveness , of triumph , and anticipation . Wondering casually just what kind of fool the lad was planning to make of himself next , I wandered on toward the main entrance -- only to be stopped by an appalling uproar behind me . There was a raucous , gurgling shriek of mortal terror ; the loud composite " O-o-o ! " of a shocked or astonished crowd ; a set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then a woman 's voice raised in a seemingly endless succession of hysterical shrieks . Thinking that an animal had gotten loose , or something of that kind , I wheeled . Unmistakably the racket came from Tristan 's own tent . Cold dread clutching at my heart , and with lead on my boot soles , I rushed frantically back . At the entrance I was held by a mad onrush of humanity for some moments . When I reached the platform , Tristan was not in sight . Then I noticed the long-necked boy sitting on the platform with his face in his hands , shrieking : " I did n't mean to ! I did n't mean to ! Damn it , do n't touch me ! I thought sure it was a fake ! " I saw a new , glittering jack-knife lying on the platform beside the limp , foot-long stub of Tristan 's rope . Slowly , frozenly , I raised my eyes . The blue abyss was traceless of any object .... * * * * *      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
