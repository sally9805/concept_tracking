More Heler <P> When the wealthy Juilliard Musical Foundation gave the Metropolitan Opera Company $50,000 last year John Erskine , president of Juilliard 's Music School , made public a list of strings to the gift . One was that the Metropolitan should pay more attention to native talent ( TIME , March 13 , 1933 ) . President Erskine had taken to writing opera librettos but the Metropolitan had already scheduled the Hanson-Stokes Merry Mount for its single native venture this season . It fell to the Juilliard School last week to present Helen Retires , on which Mr. Erskine collaborated with Composer George Antheil . <P> Helen Retires is a leftover from the onetime best-selling Helen of Troy , which made Writer Erskine 's fame . The opera starts with Menelaos ' funeral banquet and Helen as tart a widow as ever she was in the novel . Though she has been loved . she has never known love 's madness . So she sets out to find Achilles on the Island of the Blest . Act I ends with movies showing a diving submarine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descent to the netherworld . There the warrior-ghosts have taken on ectoplasmic shapes . Against their warning Achilles emerges , in white knee skirts , white mittens and a skin-tight sweater with a letter A on his chest . With Helen he shoots up out of Hades on the elevator . <P> The Act III setting , supposed to be the Elysian Fields , looks like an old-fashioned cut-out valentine with harp strings on one side and a foot bridge across the middle . There Helen and Achilles sit and sing love duets . An old fisherman comes by . convinces Helen that no love can last forever . She sends Achilles back to the other ghosts , stretches herself out to die . A younger fisherman appears . After he dances vigorously for her , the incurable Helen decides to try again . <P> George Antheil branded himself seven years ago as the most freakish of U. S. composers . He grew up in Trenton , N. J. , went to Paris to live when he was 20 . After six years he celebrated his homecoming by putting on in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an airplane propeller , assorted horns , whistles and bells . The critics ' jeers drove him back to Paris . Lately he claimed that he had reformed . Helen Retires was to illustrate his conversion to melody . But basically most of its music seemed just as empty as his percussive ballet . The student singers did their parts creditably enough but most of the Erskine lines were lost in fuzzy orchestration . Helen 's 20th Century ways were described by hippety-hoppety jazz . The love waltz might have served for a routine in a banal musical show . <P> After the performance Conductor Albert Stoessel gave the collaborators medals from the American Opera Society of Chicago . Engraved on each was a message wishing " the continued success of such a fine work for the great cause of American musical art . "
