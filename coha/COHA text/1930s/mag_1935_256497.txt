Last week the following were news : <P> In Reconstruction days after the Civil War good housewives bought " Pratt 's Astral Oil , " a clear-burning , high-grade brand of kerosene refined on Long Island by two bright young men named Charles Pratt and H. H. Rogers . John Rockefeller bought out their firm in 1874 , taking the two partners with him . At that time Herbert Lee Pratt was a three-year-old in the oilman 's large family . When he was 23 and his father had grown exceedingly rich as a Rockefeller henchman . Son Herbert was graduated from Amherst in the Class of 1895 along with Dwight Morrow and Calvin Coolidge . <P> Promptly to work in a Brooklyn refinery went Son Herbert . After an eight-year apprenticeship , he was promoted to one of the Rockefeller central committees - old Standard Oil 's committee on manufacturing . When the Oil Trust was busted in 1911 , Herbert Pratt was made vice president of the New York fragment , now Socony Vacuum Oil Co. , Inc . And as he mounted to the presidency and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Standard group , the name Pratt grew as potent in the oil industry 's gasoline age as it had been in kerosene . Last week Mr. Pratt suddenly severed all connection save that of stockholder with the company he had served for 40 years . He declared that he was taking advantage of the company 's retirement plan . <P> If that meant that the company was pensioning him off , Mr. Pratt must have had his tongue in his cheek . The Pratt family 's interest in Socony is exceeded only by that of the Rockefellers , Harknesses and Whitneys . And the Pratt family is a close-knit unit . On a 1,000-acre tract in lush Glen Cove , L. I. are seven Pratt houses-four occupied by Brothers Herbert , Charles , Harold and Frederic , another by the widow of Brother John , onetime Congresswoman Ruth Baker Pratt . In the centre of their communal estate are their stables and dairy barns , an institutional layout manned by numberless grooms and milkmen . As many as 100 big &; little Pratts and their in-laws assemble for annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herbert went other changes in Socony 's high command . John A. Brown , executive committee chairman , was made president , and President Charles E. Arnott stepped down to a vice-presidency in order to devote more time to his plans for stabilizing the oil industry . <P> The prospect of a hot contest for the presidency of the New York Stock Exchange disappeared just before election last month when Richard Whitney decided not to seek official renomination for a sixth term and refused to head an independent ticket ( TIME , April 15 ) . He did , however , consent to become a candidate for one of the ten regular governorships open each year . Many an Exchange liberal was surprised when Broker Whitney polled 1,146 votes for Governor , 15 more than the vote which elected Charles R. Gay to the presidency . Last week Governor Whitney was elected chairman of the Committee on Bonds .
