IT SEEMS to be taken for granted in the I United States that our happiness and our destiny are both tied up to an unlimited growth in the production of mechanical things . That this is the point of view of our government and of all popular literature is unmistakable . That it is the basis of our national policy is admitted , or rather , proudly proclaimed . It is just as freely acknowledged that this view of the American fate is the cause of that peculiar psychology which produces for us , after each period of prosperity , a reaction of violent economic collapse . We climb higher and fall harder than do other nations . Our President is very much a man of this hour . He believes , and so do his advisers believe , just as thoroughly as do big and little business men , that the picture of life formed in our minds between 1914 and 1929 is the true American picture and the one to be figured on and calculated from in framing large national policies . Economically , Roosevelt is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartily than were Coolidge and Hoover . So no matter of party politics can be involved in a discussion as to whether this notion of our destiny is sound and useful , and if it is not sound what its dangers are , and what its bearing is on our continued economic misfortunes and on our social arrangements . Ours is a great industrial nation , and the basis of its industry is steel . It is nottoo much to say that steel is in fact the bony structure of our present civilization . But it is more than that ? it is an adaptable material which competed once with wood and stone and competes now with aluminum and topper . It has been modernized into innumerable alloys . It has fitted itself to every stage of our progress from railroad trackage on to the building of skyscrapers and automobiles and streamlined trains . Steel is both machinery and the product of machinery . It roars under our windows and it rattles over our heads . Except for steel this would he a silent and a necessarily peaceful world . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States from its beginning . In 1870 our mills produced sixty-eight thousand tons . In 1936 they produced forty-seven million tons . I have drawn a chart of the whole history of American steel . I ask the reader to examine without prejudice born of the gilded twenties the fluctuations of steel production for the past sixty-seven years . What is revealed ? Forget that this is steel . Forget also that it is American steel . And forget too your theories about the depression , and then examine the record . It is the record of something whose energies of growth have tapered off . I know all the reasons why that can not be so . I read and reread them all in a hundred financial prospectuses between 1927 and 1931 . I have been filled up , as every reader has , with the abounding faith that the New Age has just begun . But the record says no . The record says that the great age of machinery has grown out of youth into a troubled maturity since the World War . For the smoothed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a population and of a man . I have drawn this normal direction up to point A , which may be taken to represent the year of our entrance into the World War . There was no question , up to then , where we were going . The growth curve had flattened out as our population curve had long before flattened out early in the nineteenth century . After 1917 three views are possible as to what is happening to American steel . I have indicated those possibilities by my three-branched curve . It might be held that the tendency of the increase in steel production and consumption is destined to go up illimitably along the line A B. That , it is very obvious , was the boom line of the 1920 's . Along such a line of advance we quite clearly have to travel to attain our President 's hope of a hundred-billion-dollar national income within the next decade , if that income is to have a purchasing power comparable to that of a 1936 dollar . I am not contending of course that the national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past where we have any accurate record of our income that is a correlation , which seems very natural when we consider into how many phases of production , of building , and of agriculture steel enters in its old and new forms . : So it is very difficult to imagine our attaining such a rise of income without steel production following the upward course indicated on my chart . But no human eye can look dispassionately at that chart and believe in the line A B as representing the probable future of whatever it is recording . Since 1919 it has become too difficult for steel production to continue the speed of growth it enjoyed from 1900 to 1917 . And those years since 1919 have been years of extreme stimulation by government and by private capital . The common-sense view would be that by 1914 our period of high-speed industrial growth was ending . The youth of steel was past . Its curve was definitely flattening off . The War interrupted this phenomenon with a sudden demand . Between 1925 and 1930 we were again operating beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fact was revealed by the disastrous collapse which followed and which resulted , in 1932 , in the output of our steel mills falling to a tonnage below anything recorded in the preceding thirty years . That , I say , is the common-sense view : it is represented by the line A C and corresponds with our experience that 1936 was a normal year , and that 1925 to 1929 were abnormal years . If that is so , then steel is in the last phase of its curve of activity , which would mean that we are consuming almost as many pounds per capita as we need for a satisfactory life and that the growth in output will tend to adjust itself more and more closely to the growth in population . Except for the influence of boom psychology this seems an extremely reasonable thing to have happen . Because in 1936 each one of us was accountable for the use of some 700 pounds of steel and in addition some 400 pounds of pig iron , steel production has been going on for seventy years , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is bound sometime to occur . It is my view that we are approaching it and are trying desperately , and on the whole vainly , to ignore the fact and its consequences . It is also possible to examine this chart and to conclude that the line A D represents its trend . If so , what has happened in our lifetime is that the peak of the mechanical age has been passed , and in that view the boom of the 1920 's was its final flowering and the Empire State building its most splendid monument . I am not contending for this view , which I do not hold ; but it is just as much of a possibility as that the line A B will go on rising toward a supermechanical future . In the output of automobiles and in the registration of cars we see a more rapidly developing example of a growth curve that begins slowly , straightens out into an amazing rise , and then levels off again , exactly as does the growth curve of steel production . This is an age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant invention of new household devices and the substitution of electric power for steam in so many factories have caused the output of power to rise while other indices were declining . But the great growth lay between 1910 , when only one-fifth of our homes and factories were using current , and 1930 , when four-fifths of our factories were electrified and two-thirds of our homes . From now on more and more effort will be necessary to push up the power output of this electrical age . HARPER 'S MAGAZINE is not a technical journal , but I am presenting an economic fact that contradicts too many prepossessions of the present hour to be able to do so conclusively without showing you one more diagram . What the facts mean is the theme of this article , but the facts themselves , while available to all , have been ignored or denied in our policies and in our thinking and in the endless discussion of the great business depression that has hung for so long like a black cloud over our lives . Our mechanical civilization has grown up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise in our production ? is not a phenomenon of any so-called business depression of mysterious or political origin . What we are now calling a depression is something different from any setback that has ever occurred in the United States before . It is the culmination of our growth and the ending of a long chapter in our history , and just as inevitably the beginning of another . It is the result of the maturing of our mechanical culture , which can not be induced to continue its former rate of growth , any more than a man of twenty-two can be made to grow like a youth of fourteen by any medicine or system of exercise . I have plotted here the rote of growth by decades of the most significant factors in our economic history , as well as the rate of our population growth since 1850 . At the beginning of the life of anything the rate of growth , in per cent a year , is high . That rate drops off as the growing thing approaches its maturity . Here is the record of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our output of steel , our output of electric power , and the registration of automobiles . It was inherent in the headlong speed of our mechanical development that we should reach a ceiling sometime , a point beyond which our progress would be necessarily slower , more normal , and more mature It was also inherent in our national character that we could not believe that fact when it arrived , that we should fight it in the old pioneer spirit . We fought it industrially first , with new devices of production . ( The World War coming at that time gave us the illusion of a victory . ) Then we fought financially . Later we fought it politically , that is by direct government action . We produced fluctuations , but the growth rate was not noticeably affected . The converging and leveling of these rates of growth means that a new America is being born in a period of violent protest at that fact . There is no pessimism in this statement . A continuously rapid growth would mean a supermechanical saturation such as could hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for us to face the reality and to modify our policies to fit the actual world we live in . For a long time it has been observed that the human death rate rises in every boom . What conditions , what pressures of exertion or overactivity produce that rise are not completely known , but obviously some factors not humanly advantageous have accompanied our rapid industrial expansion . It is not the business of economists to record that between 1914 and 1930 the artificiality of American life rose as decisively as did the national income and the national consumption . The American people adapted themselves to the creation and use of roughly six hundred dollars ' worth of manufactured goods a head within a year . But they did so only through other kinds of extravagance of behavior that do not always figure in charts and that do not always add to final satisfaction . There was an ugliness in our national life in those boom years , an increase in crime , in drinking , in divorce , in general superficiality , and in physical violence of death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death in war . They were almost , by those records , our nation 's most shameful years , and the world 's most shameful years . Now it may be that a better distribution might prevent all those consequences of the large production and consumption of manufactures , and it may be too that it would make them more general , if we pushed forward during the next decade to a hundred-billion-dollar national income , and so out-fevered the fevers of 1929 . But it remains to he proved that the differences which have made some men farmers , some village-dwellers , some city clerks , some mechanics , and some bankers are wholly economic . It is assumed that there is a preference on the part of all for the necessarily more artificial life of high industrial production and consumption , and that this preference is desirable , and that it is the state 's business to promote it . It is assumed that in a year such as last year , when bank balances were higher than at any time in our history except in the three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and savings accounts larger than ever before , it was only fear which prevented the stubborn consumer from consuming , and the stubborn capitalist from expanding his investments in industry . But how do we know it was fear ? How do we know it was not a general and still scarcely conscious indigestion of material things , and an impatience with the kind of life they lead to ? There is evidence for that conclusion . And how do we know that business needs capital to be invested in expansion ? That is a highly theoretical notion wherever it is held . In a year when nothing is operating up to capacity but airplane factories , and in a country where nothing has been operating at capacity for seven years ( except now and again in textiles in rush seasons , which have been followed by long relapses ) , when we have too many railroads and too many motor cars and too much of everything for those who have money to buy them , it would seem that our machinery is not stalled by a lack of capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the question of the distribution of our wealth , which is always top-heavy in every civilization and was just as topheavy in 1929 as it is now . Much has been done to improve the distribution of our national wealth through the support of the unemployed , through the soldier 's bonus , and in many other ways . But the main fact remains that when we speed up production , as we did in 1936 , and distribute the wages of production , which are higher relatively than ever before , and insure the prosperity of agriculture , as we never did before , demand falls off , and the wheels of production stall . And savings rise . II There is nothing mysterious about our slowing down . The twenty-year hump in our growth curve of manufacture and consumption was not all a production of perishable goods or improvements . A man who comes to my door to sell eggs may come every week and be welcome and sell eggs . But a man who comes to sell heating equipment need call only once or twice in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true that every American would enjoy having a new motor car every year . But cars are durable , and the market is glutted with good used cars from which pleasure and use may still be had . And this is apparently a permanent condition , brought about by the improvement of the materials from which cars are constructed . Also , strange as it may seem to some , there are many men who do not wish their families to own motor cars for reasons not wholly economic . Of that more later . Despite that fact we have nearly reached a point at which there is one car registered for every family in the United States . I do not say that that is a natural ceiling , but it is a ceiling nevertheless , which may he pierced only with increasingly greater effort . Such ceilings are close over the heads of every great American industry except the manufacture of airplanes and of implements of war . In both of those cases there are psychic ceilings . Another factor in our decline in growth rate is this : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and machinery which is largely self-perpetuating . So our proportion of the world 's foreign trade , which rose sharply in those boom years when we were supplying material for the reconstruction of Europe , has fallen back to its former level of about ten per cent . It leaps up again when any nation goes out of production and goes in for war . It did in 1937 , but that fact did not halt our decline . The world is growing up industrially . We are no longer its pioneers . We have taught our neigh-hors to fend for themselves on the American plan . And though there are great potential markets for our productions in China , Japan , India , and parts of Europe , the great illusion of the 1920 's can no longer be maintained . We can not sanely anticipate selling our products to foreign lands through the device of lending them unlimited capital with which to make the purchases , as we attempted to during the last great boom . We discovered then that if they repay us at alt they must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every item they buy , and in that fact is another limitation on the future of our production . Our population growth preceded our industrial growth and for a long time paralleled and stimulated it , because we were lucky enough to own huge areas of virgin land still unsettled at the beginning of the industrial age . But as pioneer conditions disappeared our growth slowly declined to half its pioneer rate . In the past few years it has been proceeding at one-quarter of its pioneer rate . In his Biology of Population Growth Raymond Pearl has made a study of the factors which produce a gradual decline in the growth rates of human populations . Those factors sometimes operate obscurely , but it is not strange that when growth for its own sake is no longer as desirable as it used to be growth should slow down , whether for men ranging over the whole round globe of the world or for fruit flies in a milk bottle . The invention of power-driven machinery made possible all over the civilized world denser populations than wholly agricultural life was ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reduce human fertility , especially when it is accompanied by the increased conveniences and more varied amusements which industrialism made accessible . That is not a directly economic result , but rather a social and psychic result . But when population growth slows down , that fact reacts on an industrial growth which has always been paced to a rapid expansion of demand . So the two growths of people and of machinery tend to leap up and then to slow down together . A fourth factor in the slowing of our growth curves for industrial products is the one , I feel , we shall have finally to reckon with most , as we turn from the problem of booming our output to that of extending the benefits of our output to those who are still poor in things . It is my observation that among the middle classes men are growing more and more restive , and less and less content with their position in this industrial scheme . Not until this age have men ever been compelled to forgo the general interests of life and to surrender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the minor boom of 1935 many employers of labor discovered that workers ? even heads of families ? preferred to remain on relief rather than to accept employment at higher rates of pay in private industry . Instances prove nothing . But the general belief that men are more willing to be idle than they used to be may have a basis of fact that is not at all derogatory to them or to the policies of the New Deal . Whatever may be true of the lowest-income group , in the middle classes , where the largest consumer demand is certainly now to be found , men are beginning to find themselves in a peculiarly disadvantageous position . For a span of years , fairly coinciding with the boom time , advertising copy has been addressed more and more to the desires of women and children . The woman has become the family spender . Now allowing to the American male all possible chivalry and pride in his wife and children , there is a point in the family economy at which a certain crude justice is likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suggest that it has supervened . At about the time when the doctrine that woman 's place was in the home was abandoned politically and socially , and in a sense morally , salesmanship for mechanical improvements concentrated on the home a battery of devices of a predominantly feminine utility . The result was that , although woman 's place was not exclusively in the home any longer , the home became more and more woman 's domain ? or rather the woman 's and children 's domain . And once it was a man 's castle . It is the woman 's domain , but manufacture is relieving her of many ofits traditional burdens . Manufacture is able to do very little for the man as a domestic animal . And every burden that goes off of her shoulders goes onto his . And that is right enough , up to a point . And then it is not . Well beyond the point where it is not , the curve of our mechanical rise slows down . For the past twenty years we have held hard to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a washing machine , an oil heater , a new car every year , a telephone , a radio , and in time an air conditioner and a television receiver . That is our domestic creed . But there is a psychological difficulty with that creed , which is otherwise excellent economics . Everyone does not wish life to require so much trouble , any more than every boy of seventeen wants , can take , or will endure further schooling , except under heavier and heavier pressures . Big business and government in the business of stimulating consumption have run up against a fact more potent and more understandable than fear . And that fact is the inherent inability of men to want for their women and children what men can personally get along without , and can easily believe that women and children are better off without , if those advantages involve a larger individual struggle than men arc satisfied to make . It seems to be forgotten that the United States has produced not only a Henry Ford but a Henry Thoreau , and that the two men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new term in American economics . Customer reluctance with rising bank balances is almost a new phenomenon , as applied to our general production of things . But when the Boy Scout movement and the summer camp movement and the dude ranch movement began to grow , parallel to the growth in consumption of manufactured goods , notice was being served that the American was also human and not merely a symbol in economic theory . Every sample modern house , of the sort recently exhibited in New York and elsewhere as a stimulus to consumption , gives a wholly feminized picture of life . In this view the passing of the easy chair was economically more significant than the invention of the radio . In the average home , up to the beginning of the era of our greatest mechanical expansion , there was certain to be a Morris chair or a Larkin rocker where the man of the house was relaxed , enthroned , and at ease . Quite truly ours was then a male world , but a male world moving forward and digesting its own progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family motor car , and the new sense of sharing and companionship and even of male superiority which it made possible . But now , in a modern home of the same class , where the family car is in constant requisition by the younger generation , where the woman often has it to herself for nine hours a day and the man practically never , there is a very different picture . There is a radio , whose entertainment is mainly directed to that juvenile or female taste which controls the purse strings . The Morris chair or its equivalent has disappeared as an old-fashioned and slovenly relaxation , and its modern substitute is covered with velour . I am depicting this change mainly from a study of the mail-order catalogues of the past twenty years . It is not necessary to insist on this explanation as the only one , or even the most significant one for the fact recorded in the charts . I can not prove statistically that men will not push themselves on much faster for this kind of a world , where they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can afford a set of golf clubs . But the general business charts indicate that there is something basically wrong with our mechanical scheme , and something that is not a temporary disorder , although we behave politically as though it were . As James Roosevelt said in Middletown , Ohio , in reference to government spending , " When we taper off , your income goes down , and we go farther away from a balanced budget . " That is the fact I am dealing with . Translate that fact into other terms and it says just this : for our people as a whole , and as they are at present constituted , a point of marginal utility has been reached , and not only been reached , but possibly passed in the demand for mechanical productions , by a large part of our population , and reached in America first of anywhere in the world . Ill The principle of marginal utility is merely applied common sense . If a man has to labor or to worry more for a higher standard of living than for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time the process that forces him on will fail of its effect . And there is a limit beyond which more of the same kind of things will not entice him to increased effort . The evidence is clear that many of us passed that limit sometime between 1914 and 1929 . More clothes , more golf , more alcohol , more gasoline , and more bridge , however illimitably offered , failed to drive men on into the promised land of still more golf , alcohol , clothes , gasoline , and bridge . And whatever else life had to offer was not mechanically contrived or conditioned . In regard to mechanical devices our main problems are solved . Additional inventions become necessarily more special and more complex , and the time arrives when further devices become less and less important , whether their maintenance is more of a burden or not . Other people 's motor cars are a physical danger , and our own a financial hazard . Other people 's radios are a mental burden , and our own a social responsibility . There can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sery ants from whom the producing member of the family gets the least benefit . At some point such a set-up is bound to break down . Television , for instance , is more complex than radio , particularly in its transmission . It is a more delicate device to just the extent that two dimensions are more complicated than one . Even in its present development it is a successful and a marvellous invention . But it does not add so much to life as radio did . It may bring the stage and the moving picture into the home , where the moving picture can already be had , and it may transmit the daily news more vividly than we can now get it from our broadcasters or the papers , and it will be precious for propaganda . But what can it add to life but a new way to present current events and entertainment ? The radio has already achieved that for the home . The stage and moving picture provide dramatic pleasure with the slight additional satisfaction of a change of environment . So what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but my point is that the element of necessity does not go along into the further complexities of new invention . We can not expect to make a new age out of the pursuit of mechanical toys , however ingenious or profound the theories on which those toys are constructed . It is not consonant with human nature . In almost every American home there is an electrical or mechanical train if there is a male child in the house . But where is it now ? Locked up in a bureau drawer till next December , while the boy is playing with a baseball and bat , over on the vacant lot . We are only grown-up children . And there are many human pleasures which too much machinery interferes with . Conversation is one , walking , reading , and sleep are others . If the facts mean what I take them to mean , much that now seems merely a perversity of fate becomes intelligible . But that meaning points on to a kind of future world quite different from that predicted by those who are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to a faster but to a slower rate of growth . The diffusion of advantages , rather than the creation of new ones , will be its chief social problem ; not to stir up a new boom , but to insure steady progress toward a general happiness , not built on debt . As agriculture is doing to-day , industry will be supplying all reasonable needs with a constantly diminishing manpower . What will all the rest of the men and women of that world be doing ? Because we do not yet know the answer to this question , because we are so conditioned by our mechanical dream that we can not imagine an answer in terms of our present world picture ( except perhaps to employ these people in singing songs , painting pictures , or doing aesthetic dances on the green ) , we are inclined to reject the possibility altogether . It is far easier for us to picture people as spending their time whisking about aboard rocket ships , on God knows what errands of cosmic salesmanship , or playing ball with atomic bombs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner , it seems to me that the problem will be solved very simply if we begin to solve it now for the unemployed of our present machine-filled world . What do we need most ? In that question lies the secret of our destiny . Is it really more motor cars ? Is it really television ? Is it really a new product , or are those not rather the answers of desperation than of truth ? I admit that we can still he persuaded , but what do we really need ? Better housing of course , but not for those who have adequate housing . Whatever economists may say , old homes are not worse than new homes if they have the necessary fittings we have accepted as needful to health . But what we do need is clear enough , and it has very little to do with super-skyliners and one-wheel trolley cars . We need more teachers and more nurses , more doctors and more dentists , more surgeons , more scientists studying the problems of life and health , more foresters and bigger forests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn out an article that is a real 1938 , and not a slavish duplicate of a million other pieces ; we need more hand-wrought things of every sort . We do not need less machinery , but we do need more civilization , and I believe that need is the one that is now asserting itself . Business and government ONE HUNDRED have not yet digested that fact , but we ourselves are digesting it and proclaiming it , and are forcing a new kind of civilization to appear . It is not jobs that make needs , but needs that make jobs . And that is the fact which stalls us now . It is a fact which has refused to respond to all the financial devices used to get round it . And so long as we continue to think of the general needs as purely mechanical needs it is likely to stall us forever . There are two things going on now in society that seem destined to shape its future . One is a struggle , on the part of the underprivileged , for those necessities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is the dynamic remainder of our growth , but it is very far less of a force than the one existing when all of us were struggling together for a conquest of famine and weather and cold , because it reaches down to those who are individually unable , or unprepared , or even unwilling to struggle , and who must be helped and led . And that is not a spectacular , but a mature task . Not at all a pioneer business , in any old sense of the phrase , but a growth within . The other force is the urge for luxuries . But that also is not so dynamic as were the forces that drove us to conquer the West , and mine coal , and transport the Western wheat to our Eastern cities , and our Eastern necessities to the West . These new devices are , after all , mere finishing touches . One can take them or leave them alone . So it is not likely that all of our present dreams will be fulfilled except our dreams about human knowledge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school boy of to-day , those soaring towers , those cellophane cities , those super airplanes , have all a darker and once invisible side that is plain now and in the light . Machinery is a terrific irritant of human passion . Dug-up things are not illimitably good . Even the dreamers of the late nineteenth century could not think of any sound use for their new machines but the one they came to in 1914 . The easier we make it to go to new places the less variety remains in the places we get to . There is no earthly paradise to be had through motion . Only a smaller earth . We have preceded the world in this mechanical conquest of nature . We have attained that conquest with the least possible irritation to ourselves . The slowing of our growth rate in the production of devices predicts the fate of the world , and we may well thank a kind Heaven for what it predicts . Population pressure is the general cause of war . The immense development of industrialism early in the nineteenth century , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan whose pressures are now the great disturbance to human peace . When the industrial pace slackens , that supporting factor of over-population will end . With us population growth slowed first and that is obviously the better thing to have happen ; for much of Europe seems doomed to a period of protest , whose violence we need not share , as nationalistic dreams of unlimited growth and power face the realities of a maturing industrialism . Beyond that danger zone of time there is the possibility of a better world and a more contented world than any that we can remember . Despite our present difficulties we are in a very lucky position , and can make good use of it , if we can accept the truth about ourselves . Ask any one of a hundred busy men what he wants most and the answer will be the same ? more time . Millions of men have labored through this industrial era fighting for time to live . Thousands who have attained that goal have never discovered how to use the time they have won . For in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of time has been lost for many men . We have hints already in the growing demand for national forests , for better game laws , for small pleasure craft , that the use of time is being slowly rediscovered . The decentralization of industry is a move for the better and more healthy use of time . The old countries are forgetting what they knew about time , as we forgot it . Their pressures grow grimmer , because they are following at our heels without our natural advantages . If America is to pioneer in anything memorable during the second third of the twentieth century it is my guess that it will pioneer in a return to natural social pleasures for all . An increase of knowledge and its diffusion , and its application to all the interests and arts of life , instead of only to motions , is a progress of illimitable dimension now within our power to achieve . If the hope of great masses of our people is to find more jobs in more mills , to make still more jobs in still more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will be blasted by the event . The problem is more interesting but not so simple . Industrialism has come of age . It can no longer live on itself alone . Now , in our own lifetimes , a great problem has to be faced and solved . What was it for ? For what kind of living did we plow the wheat fields , dig the mines , build our cities , heat our homes , and carry electric mains across the continent ? Answering that is the only way we shall arrive at jobs for the jobless . For those who are not needed in factories will have to be busied , and will have to be taught how to be busied at occupations that bear on the way men live , and not at occupations that derive from more and more machinery and equipment .

Mussolini understands it well enough . We can accept their way or we can find a new way of our own . The great boom is over . What we have been waiting for is here , a maturely growing civilization that has mastered nature and can now set about using that mastery for its own happiness , with a larger humanity than was ever possible before . But if we insist that expansion is still our only reason for being here on this lucky spot , every good now in our hands to grasp may be destroyed by our childish folly .                 @ @ @ @
