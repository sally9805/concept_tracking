THE GARISH DAY A STORY BY DOROTHY THOMAS L ursE was helped into a gingham dress so stiffly ironed that it crackled , coming down over her head , and the sleeves had to be worked open with her fingertips . When the belt was tied crisply behind her she stood obligingly quiet while her grandmother rearranged her curls and fastened her ready-tied , pale-blue bow to the top curl . " There ! " her grandmother said , " She 's ready , but I do n't know about you letting her go over there . We do n't know those people . " Her mother turned from the stove to say , " Well , Fred was right here in the kitchen when they ' phoned to ask for her . If he 'd thought it was n't the thing to do he 'd have said so . They 're neighbors . If we did n't let her go after their asking it would likely make a feeling . You look nice now , Louise . Keep clean and remember to thank her when you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose it ca n't hurt her any , " the grandmother said . " I guess we coddle her too much . A child 's got to get used to different kinds of people some time . She 's nine . If she do n't know how to behave away from home and be a little lady , goodness knows when she ever will know . " " You must ask them to come over , dear , but not for any set time , " her mother warned ; " looks like there 's a raft of them . We 'll have them  --  have to I guess  --  but we 'll hold off until spring if we can and have them outside . We could have ice-cream , I suppose . " " And coconut macaroons ? " Louise asked . " I expect so . Get your wraps on now . Looks like Papa 's ready . Better take your sweater too , and leave it on to play in if the house is chill . That place is little warmer'n a barn , as I remember it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pocket that held her best Sunday handkerchief , her lace-edged one . To take the handkerchief without asking was wrong likely , but after all she was going visiting , even if it was only to the Hendersons ' renter 's place . Her grandmother helped her into her coat and tied her scarf tightly about her neck , then kissed her and turned her round for her mother 's kiss . " Be a good girl , " her mother said , " and do n't keep Papa waiting when it 's time for him to come for you . Have your overshoes on and be ready . " Her father was waiting for her . The engine was throbbing . He said nothing but smiled at her over the noise , tucked the blankets about her , backed the car into the Y he had made next to the pump-house in other turnings , and headed for the road . Louise put up her hand in her red fur-trimmed glove and waved to the two at the kitchen window . She was proud of her gloves . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they loved her and wanted good things for her , both her mother and her grand-mother had thought the red leather gloves too " fancy " for so young a girl . She rested one hand on her knee and smoothed the back of the glove with her finger-tips , and when her father , as they had made a sharp turn on to the highway , looked down at her , she smiled at him over the edge of her scarf , thanking him once more with her look for the gloves . He was intent upon driving on the snowy road and did nor talk . When they came to the driveway that led up to the Hendersons renter 's place he brought the car to a careful stop and said , " Here you are , Daughter . I 'll come for you round five , " and opened the car door for her . She leaned to him and kissed his cold chin , and he patted her back with his mittened hand . " Got on your galoshes ? Well , keep to the rut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see they 're coming to meet you . Good-by . " The wheels spun , and he was away , and she was left alone in the snowy road to meet strange children . Her heart heat fast . There were three of them , running down the slope , their hair and garments whipping in the wind . They had on no wraps . The big one , the one she had seen going past in the wagon with his father , was ahead . The Barkers had been in the Hendersons ' renter 's house less than a week , and since it was the week of New Year , there had been no school and Louise had not met them . " Hi , " the boy panted when he was near enough . " Thought you were coming for all day ! We been watching for you a long time . " " My father was going to town , " Louise said , " I came when he was ready to bring me . " Had they thought she would come alone ? " Hello , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came quite near and saw the splendor of Louise 's new white cap and scarf set and her red gloves , were silent in awe , glanced at each other , and stood shivering , with their shoulders humped up , staring . " Come on , " the boy said , " race you to the house , " and turned and ran . " Are n't you cold , " Louise ventured , " without your wraps ? " " Shucks , " the bigger girl laughed , " we do n't wrap up , ' less we 're going some place . Come on . Keep in Jimmy 's tracks . " Jimmy had not followed the road but had plunged up the slope between the little fruit trees , making a path of his own . Louise and the girls followed , stretching their legs to keep in his tracks . A short plump woman with a baby in her arms and a ring of little ones round her opened the door and welcomed them into a kitchen warm and steamy with a mingled smell of baking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hello , come on in , " she said , " the children been so lonesome , not knowing a soul in this neighborhood . We 've seen you going past with your folks , and they teased this morning for me to ' phone and have you down . We just got the ' phone in this morning . Louise  --  that 's your name , ai n't it ? How 's your mother ? How 's your folks ? " " Weil , thank you , " Louise said . The oldest girl had begun , gently , to untie and unwind Louise 's scarf and the next biggest lifted her cap from her curls as though it were a May Queen crown , and then held it to her cheek a moment . Other , smaller children came and stood close , looking at Louise with frankest adoration . " Ai n't she pretty , Mama ? " one of the girls breathed , and the boy who had come down to the road to meet her shouted in embarrassment at such open praise , " Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be soaked when that melts . " Louise had felt the dampness against her legs , but she had been too interested in the people and the house to pay attention to it . She looked down and saw that her new wool stockings were caked with snow . " Here , " the mother said , " you 'll catch cold ! Fetch a chair , Jim ; put her up to the fire . " " You bet , " the boy said , glad of a chance to do something and dumped a pile of baby clothes and a legless doll from a kitchen chair and slid it toward her . One of the girls let down the oven door , " There , get your feet up and dry ' em , " the woman said . Another of the girls squatted to take off her galoshes . " But there 's bread in the oven , " Louise protested . The mother shrugged her plump shoulders and laughed . " It 's done I think , " she said . " Yes , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " She stooped with a good-natured groan to lift out the big bread pan . " Mom , " the boys shouted , " give us a loaf ! " " Do you like hot fresh bread ? " the woman asked . " Our kids love it . All right . Hold your horses now ! Mary , get some jam . It 's in that big box over there , " she turned to smile on Louise . " We ai n't all unpacked yet , " she apologized . " Jim 's got to put up some shelves before we can have places for morc'n half our stuff . This place is short on shelf and closet space . My canned stuff 's still in that big box . " " Here , you , " one of the boys shouted , " look't , Mama ! Baby 's got her wraps ! " They all went for the smallest girl who had put Louise 's cap on her head and wound the scarf about her neck . The child ran laughing , and rolled under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of them , even the mother , on all fours , to persuade her to come out . One of the boys crawled under the bed after her and dragged her out by a leg . The scarf was somewhat the worse for the maneuvers . " She 's spoiled , " the mother told Louise , after she had given the baby a spank that made her yelp one half-laughing cry . " She 's not really the baby you know , but she was for so long we still call her Baby . She 's just three . The baby 's five months old . " " Want to see our baby ? " one of the girls asked . " Now you just let her dry that snow off first , " the mother said . " Jimmy , toss her wraps up on top of the cupboard , whydo n't you ? They 'll be safe enough there . Baby , you keep outa them galoshes ! " The one loaf that was to be theirs , hot , had been given to the boys and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here , " the oldest boy said and thrust a great hunk toward Louise . " Well , do n't give it to her like that , " the oldest girl said . " Wait till I spread it for you and put it on a saucer . Here , I got opened raspberry jam and peach butter  --  whici. ' 11 you have ? " " Peach butter , " Louise said and found her mouth watering while she watched the snowy bread being spread , first with pale butter then with peach butter . " See to the fire in the good room , why do n't you , Jim ? " the mother asked , " and you kids go in there and play and have a good time . Go on now , you boys , and bring in more cobs . " Two of them after a little wrangling went out without wraps to bring in a tub of cobs , and the girls stood round Louise , each with her piece of new bread and the jam of her choice ( Baby had both kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't it ? " one of the little ones asked . " Very good , " Louise said . The boys came in with the cobs and carried the tub through to the living room , swaggering and looking back at Louise , wanting her to admire the size of the load they had fetched . One of the little girls kicked the cobs that rolled off on to the floor toward the side of the room out of the way . A small girl , the darkest one , brought the baby , the tiny baby , and laid it across Louise 's knees . Louise had never before held a very little baby . She touched the tiny pink fingers and felt , in wonder , the strength of them as they closed on her own . Little Barkers crowded about , talking to the baby gently , lovingly . They stood on the rungs of Louise 's chair and breathed against her neck and were delighted when she said , " She 's so little , so pretty ! " " It 's a boy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seems like , a boy and a girl , and a boy then a girl , except for Susie here . She shoulda been a boy after Mary , by rights , but she was n't . " " How many are there of you ? " Louise asked . " We 're just eight , with the baby , " Mary said . " There 's Jim and then me , and then Susie , and then Jack , and then . . . " " Come on , " the boys called from the living room . " It 's good'n warm in here now  --  come on in and play . Ai n't your stockings dry yet ? " Louise got up from the chair and wiped the melted butter from her fingers with the lace-edged handkerchief . " Oh , what a pretty handkerchief ! " one of the girls cried  --  little Doily , Louise thought , but was n't quite sure . " Could I ? Would you let me hold it a while ? " " Oh , you might lose it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I wo n't , " Dolly said . " I 'll be so careful . I 'll hold it in both hands , like this . " She made a treasuring nest of her two hands and looked coaxingly at Louise . " Well , if you 're going to carry it , you ought a have it pinned on , " Mary said . " Are you going to let her , Louise ? " " I guess so , " Louise said , " for a little bit . " Susie ran to fetch a safety-pin . " I took it off the baby , " she giggled , " he 's gettin ' his dinner and will lie still and wo n't need it . Mama did n't care . Here , let me pin it on you , Dolly . " " Not way up there ! I ca n't see it ! " Dolly protested . " Sure , pin it down on her stomach where she can see it , " Mary said . " No , if you pin it too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the three-year-old , was already near and preparing to grab . Whatever she did was considered charming and adorable by the older Barkers . Arms went out to stop her eager little hands now and older sisters cautioned " Must n't touch , honey ! Just look at it ! " Doily decided it was better to have the handkerchief pinned just under her chin and that , with the aid of her mother'scracked hand-mirror , she could enjoy it just as well . " Are n't you gon na play ? " the boys were yelling . " Come on , you kids . Come on , Louise , you can go first . Take off your shoes , kids . " Louise turned from the handkerchief affair to find the boys had rearranged the living-room furniture ; had slid the tables and chairs about to get ready for some kind of game and had taken off their shoes and piled them all together in a corner . " We made it up last night , " Mary said . " And we call it ' Round We Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack said , " we put all the chairs and tables and stuff so you can jump from one to the other and then round we go like this . " Jim and Jack began the demonstration . First Jim jumped and Jack clambered to the long , deeply scarred mission-oak library table , from there to the top of the piano , from the piano to the back and the seat of a very lumpy davenport , from the davenport to a chair , from the chair to a packing box , from the box to a chest of drawers , and on to the library table again . " See , " they shouted , " it 's easy , come on ! " and Round We Go began . Mary helped Baby , who had to have her part in the game too . For the long jumps loving arms were held out for her , and the ones ahead halted a little to watch . Louise found herself sailing through the air from the top of the piano to the davenport , shouting with the fun of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she fell between the packing box and the chest of drawers and the six of them yelled in gleeful , clapping chorus , that she 'd got them seven years of bad luck , and picked up the pieces and put them in the stove . Baby watched her chance and snatched at the handkerchief and got it . Mary rescued it and the little piece that had stayed with the safety-pin , and brought it to Louise with apologies , but Louise was too intent on the continuation of the Round We Go game to care , as she should have . The boys had decided that jumping from the piano to the davenport was much the best part of the game , so they had narrowed it to that . Louise was given every third turn because she was company , and she found herself enjoying it . She had been dreading , when she took time to think of it at all , the moment when the mother who , she had been told , was feeding the baby , would come to the door and see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably order her home . When she came at last , the baby still in her arms , it was only to say , " You kids be careful now , and mind Baby so she do n't get hurt . " " Let 's go outside , " one of the boys suggested , " it 's gettin ' too hot in here , " and all the Barkers shouted agreement . The room was indeed too hot . The front door was flung open , the Barkers put on their shoes and charged out into the snow . A white-and-yellow dog came to join them , and a new game began . No one had taken time or thought to put on wraps . Wraps , with the Barkers , were for school days , for going out to meet the world . As they got too cold for comfort they ran indoors to warm a moment and to snatch refreshments that consisted of apples and soda crackers , and ran out again to share their " piece " bite by bite with Baby who had a great appetite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ladies . " All three of the boys were knights and as many of the girls as felt a leaning toward knighthood . The lances were dried sunflower stalks and shields an old boiler lid , a small smashed tin tub , a washboard , and a piece of sheet-iron . The sheet-iron , while it afforded the most protection , was hard to hold , so two knights hid behind it , one to carry it , the other to fight . A lady was a lady when she wound round her shoulders a snow-wet lace window curtain . The curtain was passed from girl to girl . Louise was queen and wore , without her right to it being questioned , a long strip of flowered China silk that a friend of the family had given Mrs. Barker to cover aquilt for the new baby . The boys thought she should have a crown , and Jimmy ran in and came out with a shiny syrup pail that fitted well enough over her curls . Her ribbon was found ( it had been lost in Round We Go ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below her ear and could be seen from the corner of her eye . It came off in time and fell into Baby 's hands . To keep Louise warm and her feet from freezing they brought her a pitchfork handle and suggested that , with it for a charger , she should gallop round and round the " field of combat " to see how the tournament went . Once a lance hit her in the shoulder and the fighting ceased and they all gathered round to find out how badly she had been hurt . She somehow kept from crying aloud , but the tears came and were wiped away with Mary 's apron . Looking on , the boys decided to give up fighting and to go into the house . The living-room door and window had been left open and the room was too cold for them , so they all went into the kitchen . There Mrs. Barker welcomed them with cookies , fresh from the oven , and a great earthenware crock full of buttermilk . Cups and glasses were brought from the cupboard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another to get the biggest possible milk mustaches . " Why do n't you read something while you 're getting dry ? " Mrs. Barker suggested . Baby was the only one whose stockings had been changed , but they had all taken off their shoes again and piled them behind the stove to dry . " Are you a good reader , Louise ? I bet you are . " " Sure she is , " Jimmy said , " you 'd know she was  --  the way she talks . " Louise 's denials were cried down , and the books were brought . There was a warped and ragged Just So Tales , a book of the adventures of Pop Eye , a very large book of fairytales with old-fashioned illustrations , and a Boys ' King Arthur . The book was chosen by laying all four in a row , then rearranging them while Baby 's eyes were shut  --  Susie 's hands over her eyes  --  and allowing her to choose . The Just So Tales were chosen , and with the Barkers lying round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a folded comfort brought from the bed in the corner , and began to read : " In those high and far-off times , Oh best beloved " . . . stopping to take a bite of cookie or a drink of buttermilk when she pleased , while her listeners waited in all patience . She was nearing the end of " How the Elephant Lost His Trunk " when Mr. Barker 's car was driven into the yard and all the children forsook her without apology , to run out to meet their father . He had brought " suckers " for all of them and a bag of pink peppermints , and he offered the peppermints first to Louise . When they all had suckers and the father had gone to look at the baby and been told how good he had been , and that Louise " liked him a lot , " they wanted to hear the rest of the story and gathered round her again . Their mother good-naturedly stepped over them , bringing the lamp for Louise to see by , fetching a great pan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighted his pipe , took Baby on his knee and listened too , and at the end said , " That 's sure a whale of a yarn , " and they all laughed and rolled round in delight when little Dolly said gravely , " No , Papa , that 's not the whale one . " " Get out , you boys , get out and bring in the cobs and fill the water pails , " Mrs. Barker said , and the boys began to fuss about it , and their mother said maybe they 'd better put on their coats , and a hunt was begun among the many coats hung on the hooks behind the kitchen door . " Here 's your father come for you , looks like ! " Susie sang out . " Oh , pshaw , Louiseie , it seems like you 've hardly been here ! Get down her wraps , Jim . " Jim began leaping to reach her wraps from the top of the cupboard , but Mary had to bring a chair to search for the second glove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the cupboard had been moved out from the wall . Baby gave itup at last from where it had been tucked down her front inside her undershirt . All the Barkers stood silent , watching wonderingly while Mary helped wind the white scarf about Louise 's neck and Susie fetched and held the galoshes . Several times little Barkers had run to the door to shout to Louise 's father , " She 's coming . She 's getting her wraps onl " They went out , an escort of seven , to see Louise into the car , to watch the tucking of the blanket about her , to wave and shout , " Good-by , good-by , good-byl " The first stars had come out , very clear and bright in the winter sky . The sky and the snow too were palest blue . Louise 's father was quiet except to say , " Their fence here needs fixing , bad . Hope they get at it soon . " Louise found it necessary in the cold , to sniff , and felt in her coat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remembering the good handkerchief , she remembered too that she had not thanked Mrs. Barker  --  that she came away without saying the things a little girl should say at the end of a visit . She thought of their kitchen at home , with its clock-ticking quiet ; with everything in its place , and she felt that she had been away a long time , in a strange country , with a strange and happy people . She was tired , tired to sleepiness , and leaned against her father . He had begun to hum to himself , to hum " Lead Kindly Light , " and listening , too tired , too content to hum with him , Louise thought the words of the song , " I loved the garish day in spite of . . . " He patted the blanket over her knees and said , " Did you have a good day , Daughter ? " " Yes , " Louise said sleepily , " just  --  just garish , Papa . " " That 's good , " he said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play with you some Saturday . " The Barkers playing Round We Go in their living room ! It was past imagination . It could not happen ever in the world . The Barkers , themselves , and their life were as unreal as one of the tales ? *01 " ta'r -- she had read to them . How their eyes had shone listening . Now she saw the lights of her home and the orderly door-yard and knew how the supper table would look set with its four blue plates . " Here we are , " her father said . She knew her grandmother would say when she saw her with her dirty cap , rumpled dress , without her bow on her hair , " Bless me , is this my girl ? " and how if she spoke the truth , she would say , " No , Grandma , no . I 'm not . I 've been a Barker  --  and I liked it . " HOME WITHOUT DUCKS BY ROBERT P. TRISTRAM COFFIN T ROSE ahead of two good morning stars 1 . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a boy . Two miles of night I walked through , and I came out in a light Made half by dawn and half by frost . Each pine Stood feathered with the frost and full of shine , The flakes of light shook off the trees and flew Ahead of me as I went pushing through , I had soft white around me in a shower , And I was walking through an opened flower . I came upon a pool where as a boy I sat upon my legs in midst of joy So long that all the lower part of me Was there no longer and my head swam free , Until the ducks came slanting , and I shot And sprang up from a boy , a man white-hot . But not a duck came slanting steep as rain To change me from a man to boy again , Nothing in that vast white beauty stirred Where trees were blossoms , not a single bird . I started home without a thing to show Along a hill hung with a breath of snow , And suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two aureoles , They went along with me , the trees took fire , The hill became a diamond entire , A thousand rainbows trembled through the trees , I walked deep in them above my knees , And I drew in , each time I took a breath , Light enough to last me beyond death .
