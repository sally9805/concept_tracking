What the U. S. entered in 1929 and emerged from in 1935 was a Depression . The current fall of security values and business indices was officially designated by President Roosevelt in his message to Congress this week as a Recession . <P> In several particulars the Recession is more remarkable than the Depression . It is remarkable because the 35% plummet from last summer 's high is the swiftest decline in the history of U. S. business and finance . It is remarkable because the big , obvious factors which are usually held responsible for economic retrograde- swollen credit , top-heavy inventories , unmanageable surpluses-are not in existence . Business did overextend itself last spring , just before the President dampered the roaring commodity boom . But in large measure the principal cause of the Recession appears to be purely psychological , the result of Capital 's mass pessimism about the future , and a consequent reluctance to make future commitments . The Recession is also remarkable because , of all the men in the U. S. who had the statistical information about it at hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming . Rapid but not remarkable were the first of the moves with which he undertook , last week , to battle Recession . <P> Awaiting the start of a special session called before the current slump had been diagnosed as much more than a technical reaction in stocks , Franklin Delano Roosevelt spent the week much as Herbert Hoover spent November 's second week eight years ago : holding conferences to find some way to halt the decline , to restore confidence throughout the land . <P> First came the official callers : WPA Administrator Harry Hopkins , Economist Leon Henderson , Isador Lubin of the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Lauchlin Currie from the Federal Reserve 's Division of Research and Statistics . Asked if the situation called for expansion of Government spending , WPA Administrator Hopkins answered that it was much too early to say . Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau , who presumably stated his chief 's views on budgetary matters in his speech two days later ( see p. 16 ) , also popped into the Executive wing , as did Daniel Roper , Acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Assistant Secretary of Labor in September to become RCA 's director of labor relations-and Chairman Robert L. Doughton of the House Ways and Means Committee . <P> Then came the businessmen : President Robert E. Wood of Sears , Roebuck , President Gerard Swope of General Electric , Chairman Marriner Eccles of the Federal Reserve Board , President Henry C. Turner of Turner Construction Co. , Banker S. Sloan Colt . When the stock-market promptly registered a hopeful advance after these conferences , it was so much like old times that the New York Sun printed a parallel series of 1929 and 1937 headlines . In the Hoover tradition , but not the Hoover manner , the President let it be known that he hoped to end the decline not by Government spending but by doing all he could to persuade private capital to take up the slack caused by the curtailment of Government spending . This maneuver entailed a Recession from earlier New Deal fiscal policies . <P> As the President saw them , these were the chief immediate ills and this was what to do about them : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
