txt Withdrawal of Southern Pacific 's financial support for the St. LOUIS Southwestern Railv.ay Co. and a substantial money loss for the Southern Pacific Co. appear as the probable results if the Interstate Commerce Commission acts in accordance with recommendation of its examiner that it deny application of the latter road to acquire control of the former by purchase of capital stock . Examiner Thomas F. Sullivan . : n his report which is not final , but a recommendation to the full commission , stated that upon the facts presented the commission should find that the public interest has not been shown to require the proposed acquisition . The price to be paid for the stock , the examiner stated , is " clearly too high in view of the substantial and consistent reduction in earnings and the substantially weaker condition of that , carritrr : " Southern Pacific has already purchased 57.200 shares of Cotton Belt preferred and 42. - 600 common .

In the event the commission does not authorize the acquisition of control by that date the Southern Pacific will , prior to October 13 , 1931. substitute for itself another purchaser of the stock upon the same terms .

Road Agreed to Make Up Any Shortage If the net proceeds of such sale amount to less than the unpaid balance of the purchase price , the Southern Pacific agreed to pay the difference between such proceeds and the agreed price , whereas any excess would be paid to the applicant road . The stock purchase was arranged by Henry ' W. de Forest , chairman of the board of directors of the Southern Pacific Co , with New York Investors , Inc. , and the bankers then took the stock as escrow agents at a commission of $1 per share . Report stated that when two representatives of minority stockholders approached Chairman de Forest . asking to be advised of the Southern Pacific 's attitude in regard to the minority stock , they were informed that a statement of the Southern Pacific position in this regard should be made only at the hearings on the application . when all minority stockholders would have the same information at the same time . " At a later date , prior to the hearing and after the decline in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the Cotton Belt , " report stated , " representatives of the minority stockholders were informed that the applicant probably would make no offer for of around 12a. for the common and 20 for the preferred Southern Pacific has a total paper loss of approximately $15,700.000 .

See- . Upset for Official Plan Examiner 's report opposed assigning the Cotton Belt to th Southern Pacific system in stead of to the Illinois Central system as provided by official consolidation plan of th. coralMS-51011 Report admitted that while the plan may not be regarded as the final word on the subject , but may he modified as conditions warrant . it is apparent , nevertheless , that certain fundamental principles have been regarded in making the allocation which may not be upset v.ithout throwing the plan into confusion it not actually destroying it .

" Further ; statement was made that the Southern Pacific proposed notning which would impair the value of the minority stock but that on the contrary its position might be improved under the proposed plan . Minor:ty'stockholders intervened in the hearings on the application with Walter E. Meyer , of New York City , representing the St. Louis Southwestern Protective Committee , and after close of the hearings an intervening petition was filed by Lucius R.

The Southern Pacific already owns 87,200 shares of preferred and 42,600 shares of Cotton Belt common stock .

Southern Pacific began purchasing Cotton Belt stock in 1929 .
