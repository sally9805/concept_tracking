 | Are There Too Many of Us ? Condensed from the New Outlook ( March , ' 33 ) Louis I. Dublin Vice-President and statistician of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company , who has made a ten-year study of American population R EVOLUTIONARY CHANGES are taking place in the population of the United States . Few , even in high places , in government or in business , realize how far-reaching these are . How many know , for example , that the present generation is not reproducing itself ; that in only a few more decades we shall reach our maximum numbers , likely never to exceed Y 50 millions ; and that our population will change from one that is predominantly young to one that is predominantly old ? The old grandiose dreams of America 's future will die hard because they still seem to be supported by the facts . The 1930 l1 . S. Census recorded a population of 122,775,046 . The increase in Yo years was in excess of 17 millions , the largest in the history of the country . The population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the largest in the world . But the rate of growth during the last Yo years was about as low as for the preceding decade when , because of the World ' %1 ' ; u- and the influenza epidemic , it was the lowest for any 10-year period in the history of the country . The increase , moreover , was largely in the earlier part of the decade ; and it is now clear that the tendencies of the last 2o years are becoming much accentuated . In 1931 , for example , the numerical growth in population was only approximately 800,000 . With possibly one or two exceptions , we must go back at least 65 years before we find a year when the increase was so small . At that time the country was less than one third as large as it is now . The change is due primarily to two forces . First , there is the striking fall in immigration resulting from restrictive legislation . Indeed , due to the depression , over 1 20,00o more people left the country in 1931 than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excess of births over deaths . In the last Yo years our birthrate has declined nearly 25% , while the mortality rate has remained fairly stationary . When the next Census is taken in 1940 , there will be many surprises . The best guess is that in 1940 our population will not exceed 131 millions . I recall a  | conference of business leaders , economists and statisticians only a few years ago which outlined a program of automobile production for the present decade on the assumption of a population increase each year up to 140 millions by 1940- These are facts which should be disquieting , especially to business leaders who until recently thought only in terms of continued expansion at the old rate and who built up the productive facilities of their plants to meet ever increasing consumer demand . They now ask whether these changes are only temporary slips resulting from depression ? Or are we to look henceforth to continuously slackening growth with a stationary population at a comparative low level only a few decades off ? These are not academic questions . On their answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor , and the general planning of a successful economy . Our past unprecedented increase in numbers was due not so much to natural fertility as to external causes . Immigration not only swelled our numbers but gave us a huge reserve of very fertile people at the ages of parenthood . The native population , living largely on the farms , was also much more prolific than it is now . Today the number of children to a completed marriage has arrived at a point - namely , just under three - where the population no longer reproduces itself . The excess of births over deaths , which still amounts to about 900,00o a year , would be completely wiped out were it not for the effect of the artificial and temporary condition of a favorable age distribution - that is , the disproportion of our people who are under age 30 . The present rate of decline in ; the birthrate can not continue unabated without the obvious consequence of early race suicide . On the very likely assumption that the birthrate will ultimately decline from the present level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will reach its maximum of somewhat less than 1 5o million about 1970 and will then go into a rapid decline . It should fall to 140 million by the year 200o and to 75 million by 2100 I believe that this prognostication is very likely to be realized if present ' tendencies toward very small families continue to prevail . The most significant part of our analysis relates to the changes which will occur in the age distribution of the population . There will be a continued and marked drop in the proportion of young people and a corresponding increase in the number of older persons . In 1930 those under 20 constituted 38.8o " fo of the popula-  | tion ; those over 50 , 17.1% % , When we shall have arrived at a stationary population , the proportion of persons under 2o will be approximately 26% , and of those over 50 years , 35% . We shall then give every appearance , not of youth but of age . These estimates , which have been carefully checked and confirmed by students of population , will make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . Industry , in the past , has been geared to an ever increasing local market for goods , the psychology of the nation in the past has been altogether an expansionist one . We prided ourselves on the fact that we would be the greatest people in the world , greatest in numbers , in riches , in our capacity to produce and consume . This attitude reflected our youth - the energy and exuberance that goes with a preponderance of young people . There is obviously to be a cruel awakening , and this awakening will come soon . We shall then all realize that America has had its day and has begun to decline . It is the o Id story all over again . As nations have grown in power and wealth , they have invariably indulged in selfish pleasures at the expense of family life . It will become increasingly necessary for business men to readjust their programs of pro duction in conformity with the slackening increase of population during this and the next decade , and , later on , with stationary and even declining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create the kind of goods demanded by a population in which the middle aged and the old will increasingly predominate . The note which I have struck is , however , not necessarily pessimistic . We have the natural resources and all of the necessary facilities to provide for a population of 150,000,000 on a very high standard of living . It is vital , however , that we shall not permit our numbers to fall much below this figure . If our population should diminish to the 100 million mark and then to 75 millions , the consequences would be appalling . We should be a ' beaten people , burdened with unused facilities and a crushing overhead . With numbers properly adjusted to our facilities and resources , we can enjoy a wellorganized society , free of such obvious maladjustments as poverty . We need only employ our matured men and women for short hours for what each can do best ; our youth must be permitted more time for education , on the one hand , and our superannuated , on the other , can be provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
