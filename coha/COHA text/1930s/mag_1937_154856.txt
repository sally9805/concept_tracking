For a quarter of a century British racing crowds have shouted themselves hoarse , exulted , wept , torn handkerchiefs and smashed toppers for a bandy-legged , wizened little Irishman who always responded to an imploring " Come on , Steve ! " Last week in London , Steve Donoghue , still going strong at 52 , announced that this , his 31st year as a jockey , would be his last . <P> Steve Donoghue 's first mount , Turkish Delight , at Dublin 's Phoenix Park in 1907 , was a winner , but Jockey Donoghue did not become a familiar figure to British enthusiasts until he won the Cambridgeshire at Newmarket three years later . In 1915 he was entrusted with a Derby favorite . S. Joel 's Pommern , and won-a performance he repeated two years later with Gay Crusader . In 1921 Jockey Donoghue became a British hero when he brought in his third Derby winner , the 6-to-1 shot Humorist , who dropped dead from heart failure six weeks after the race . The following year , when his mount , Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the starting parade and the odds jumped to 10-to-1 , Steve Donoghue rode to his smoothest Derby victory . When he won again the next year with Ben Irish 's 100-to-15 shot Papyrus , he and his mount were sent to the U. S. to race against that year 's Kentucky Derby winner , Zev , with famed Earl Sande up . Donoghue and Papyrus lost the race and Mr. Irish lost the $100,000 purse . <P> Steve Donoghue won the Derby once more after that-in 1925 with H. E. Morris ' Manna-to set a record of six Derby victories . His total of 1,840 winners does not approach the all-time record of 2,775 , established by England 's 19th Century Fred Archer . He has won for his employers considerably less money than Jockey Sande 's record of $3,034,858 . And by retiring this year he will cut himself off from another record : 46 years of jockeying , set by Great Britain 's John Osborne . As a public figure , however , Steve Donoghue has equaled any of them . When he broke his leg during a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best wishes for a quick recovery . Already well known to British cinema audiences , he appeared on the U. S. screen last spring in a Derby picture called Wings of the Morning , where his silks shone in Technicolor and he amiably submitted to jokes about his height . <P> To the last Jockey Donoghue kept his weight down to 110 lb . Lately a contract rider for Sir Victor Sassoon , owner of Shanghai 's ill-fated Hotel Cathay ( see p. 14 ) , he hoped to win this year 's Derby with Sir Victor 's Renardo , but finished in the ruck along with the favorite , the Marquis Evremond de St. Alary 's French-bred Le Ksar. * But he showed his old touch on other occasions this season by winning the Oaks at Epsom Downs and the One Thousand Guineas at Newmarket with Sir Victor 's Exhibitionist , the Irish Derby with Phideas . Jockey Donoghue 's new job will not be training Sir Victor 's horses , as was expected , but writing racing news for an Australian syndicate . <P> *Last week at A. S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Le Ksar 's famed sire , Ksar , died of an internal hemorrhage.
