txt President Roosevelt 's wealthsharing tax program , so far as it relates to corporations , will draw the continuous fire of the nation 's leading business men and financial leaders , a number who were asked for their opinions declared yesterday . Corporation heads and principal executives of financial institutions made no secret of their antipathy to the measure , which they declared , almost to a man , was unfair , unsound and unworkable . The President 's tax message appeared to have stunned financial leaders . Even yesterday , although they have had several days in which to weigh the merits or demerits of the proposal and to analyze the probable effects , if it were enacted , upon the earnings of large corporations , most of the executives interviewed seemed to have no clear idea as to how they should move to register their protests . Most of them were frankly pinning their hopes on a revolt in the House of Representatives against efforts for the adoption of the measure without allowing ample time for hearings , debate and further study . Corporation Schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation should be made into law , " said one spokesman for finance . " If it should be enacted , it is safe to say that leading business men will not rest until they have Seen the law amended ; not that they object e to paying high taxes , but because the present graduated corporation income tax is inequitable . Should Congress fall in line . or should there appear to be strong likelihood of enactment of the program in its present form , there would be a protest from important business men and bankers that would be of a striking character . " For the time being , it was indicated , the attitude of financial leaders is to sit back and wait . The chief contention of the opposition is that there is no justification for basing , tax rates upon the mere size of income without relation to the proportion which that income bears to the amount of capital invested . If a graduated tax were wanted , they said , it should be in the nature of the excess profits tax employed during the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invested . Under the proposed schedule , a corporation having a net income of more than $1,000,000 would pay 17 per cent , although that income might be equal only to a fraction of 1 per cent on its capital , financiers argued , while a smaller corporation with low capitalization might earn a high rate of return on its invested funds and pay only a 10 per cent tax . Bankers pointed out that such an arrangement would not be a " soakthe-rich " program , because the " poor " shareholder of such a corporation as American Telephone and Telegraph Company would have 17% per cent deducted from the earnings of his company , while a rich shareholder of a smaller corporation would face only a 10 per cent tax before the earnings of that corporation were passed on to him as dividends . Several corporation officials said that enactment of such a law might lead to wholesale changes in the capital structures of many leading corporations . Some , such as the Socony-Vacuum Corporation , among others , recently completed a reorganization of their corporate structures , consolidating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present proposal is made law , it was said , there would be a strong motive for many companies to revert to their former status , by setting up separate operating companies under a holding company , each operating company or subsidiary making its own tax return . Standard Oil of New Jersey is one Of the large industrial enterprises which is today in that position . American Telephone and Telegraph ' Company is an outstanding instance in the utility field . Both have a number of operating subsidiaries . Because subsidiary companies may make direct tax payments before passing their earnings into the consolidated income account , it is difficult to reach an accurate figure as to taxes paid under the prevailing flat rate of 13% per cent on corporation income and what these schedules would be under the proposed graduated scale . Assuming , however , for the purpose of illustration , that a consolidated income report of leading companies would serve as the base for tax levies , the follovhng table gives an indication of what the proposed tax plan would mean to eleven leading corporations : Tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C.

The United States Steel Corpo- ' ration last year reported a total deficit after all charges , but before preferred stock dividends , of $21 , - 667,779 . Consequently , it would not fall in the category of companies that would be affected by the new tax proposal . However , in the five years 1926 to 1930 inclusive , the company reported net incomes of $116,667,405 , $87,896,846 , $114,173,775 , $197,592 ; 060 and $104 , - 421,571 . The average per annum in this period was $124,150,331 .

On a 17% per cent basis , It would approximate $21,720,000 , a difference of $4,500,000 .

United States Steel is one of comparatively few companies which makes known the amount of taxes of all kinds that it pays . Under the existing Tax Law , a parent company does not pay an income corporation tax on dividends received from domestic subsidiaries . However , in the case of foreign-1 owned subsidiaries , it was explained , the parent company must , I pay a tax on all dividends received from them . Throughout the country there are many , corporations which are primarily family affairs , the stock being passed down from father to son , and no market for the shares ordinarily exists .

Bankers wondered what would be the effect of such a tax , for example , upon the Ford company , which is an outstanding corporation of this type . Among the organized groups registering their views on the tax program were the Merchants Association and the New York State Chamber of Commerce . The former made public a letter to the President , urging him to let the tax plan go over to the next session of-Congress on the ground that it is legislation of such far-reaching importance that it should not be enacted without due consideration and discussion . The State Chamber of Commerce , in a resolution adopted by its committee of taxation , but not as yet acted upon by the full membership , also urged delay , declaring that no emergency existed to justify haste , and that the proposed graduated tax on the net income of corporations would fall heaviest on small investors because of the wide distribution of corporate securities .
