txt A Dangerous Traffic Point . To the Editor of The New York Times : Traffic conditions on 102d Street , Richmond Hill , from Jamaica Avenue south are dangerous . At the Ninety-first Avenue intersection there have been several collisions this month . By way of making collisions more certain , the authorities have removed the red light standard that until a few days ago occupied the centre of this lively crossing . The number of near-collisions at this point is past counting . The scream of locked wheels dragging rubber over asphalt has an almost monotonous regularity . We no longer look unless we hear it end in a thud or tinkle of glass . Several remedies suggest themselves . One is the adoption of the Chicago " through street " system . Another is to make this a one-way street with a blinker marking this intersection as dangerous . A third is to have this street carefully patrolled by motorcycle policemen to prevent operation at the high speed which seems to be the unchecked practice of most of those who make use of 102d Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 28 , 1930.
