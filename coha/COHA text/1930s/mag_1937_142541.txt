A frantic obstetrician and an excited policeman chased through Boston last week , expecting disaster when they caught up with Mrs. Rubina Hartman . A few hours after giving birth to a girl in City Hospital , Mrs. Hartman , 33 , had dressed , visited friends , then gone to her home in suburban Roxbury . Nurses found the infant lying alone in Mrs. Hartman 's hospital bed . No mania impelled her , the mother averred when doctor and policeman reached her . She felt well ; she had work to do at home ; she was going to do it ; the hospital , she knew , would look after the baby and bring it to her in good time ; as for bad after-effects to herself , why she was not one of those dieting , pinched-hipped , nervous women who needs a doctor every time she has a twinge . " I 'm not going back to the hospital , " said Mrs. Rubina Hartman . <P> Discovering that she was going to give birth before she could travel from her house to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for advice . With the telephone receiver clutched to her ear . she then proceeded to do precisely what the alert obstetrician at the other end of the line told her to do . After eight minutes of this Mrs. Nelson cried that she had borne a son and started to hang up . A neighbor , however , snatched the receiver , yelled over the phone : " She 's going to have a twin . " The doctor : " Let me talk to Mrs. Nelson again . " For five more minutes Mrs. Nelson followed telephoned directions , bore her second son , sighed . " Thank you , doctor , " and hung up .
