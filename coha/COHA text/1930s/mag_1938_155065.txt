For two days last week baseball 's major-league club owners sat in secret session in Manhattan 's swank Waldorf-Astoria Hotel , solemnly plotting the 1939 course of the U. S. national game . Meanwhile baseball 's henchmen-managers , scouts , oldtimers , sportswriters , votaries-set up their " hot stove " in the Waldorf 's elegant lobby , toasted the crumbs that fell from the sovereigns ' table . <P> American League bigwigs , following in the four-year-old tracks of the National League , granted the Cleveland and Philadelphia clubs permission to play seven home games apiece under lights next year. * Both leagues compromised on a uniform ball for 1939 : an American League ( thinner ) covering with National League ( five strands instead of four ) stitching-the one extra strand supposedly giving the pitcher a better grip on the ball . <P> Of most interest to the hot-stovers were the trades the managers cooked up . Most active trader was the New York Giants ' Bill Terry . After making an even-Stephen swap with the Chicago Cubs ( Bartell , Leiber , Mancuso for Demaree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week before , the Giants paid the Washington Senators $20,000 ( plus two players ) for hard-hitting Zeke Bonura. then picked up a few more players in the lobby of the Waldorf . Most outstanding trade of the week was the Detroit Tigers ' acquisition of Pitcher Freddy Hutchinson , 19 , of the Seattle Rainiers ( Pacific Coast League ) for a reputed $50,000 and four players . <P> " Big Hutch , " a 200-lb. , 6 ft. 2 in. righthander , the sensation of the West Coast last summer , had major-league scouts tripping over one another in the Rainiers ' ball park . When he finished the season with 25 games won , seven lost , 145 strikeouts , an earned-run average of 2.48 and a batting average of .313 , Owner Emil Sick of the Seattle club put a $100,000 price tag on this rookie pitcher , fresh from high school . Although no club owner was willing to pay that amount in cash , the Tigers - outbidding the rich Yankees , Red Sox , Pirates and Cubs last week-gave almost the equivalent of $100,000 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This year the National League Brooklyn Dodgers drew 178,000 fans to seven night games , admitted that the same seven games , played in the afternoon , would have drawn 35,000.
