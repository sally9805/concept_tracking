There is still no way to get from California to China on a scheduled airline , but after three years of exploration and exploitation , Pan American Airways promises there will be April 21 when regular service is started on its 690-1111. hop from Manila to Hongkong . Meantime , last week the ship that is going to make this run was 9,000 mi. away in the Antipodes making the first test flight over Pan American 's second great transpacific venture , the 7,000 mi. airway from California to New Zealand . <P> Three years ago , when Pan American started to lay out the China line , a small cutter steamed quietly out of Honolulu , headed for the South Seas with a crew of aviation experts . Months later they were back with reams of preliminary data about weather , harbors , landing bases . Still no mention was made of any airline project , for in New Zealand Pan American 's representative , Harold Gatty , the quiet Australian who flew around the world with Wiley Post ( TIME , July 6 , 1931 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British Dominion to give landing rights to Pan American . New Zealand did not see why the U. S. should not grant her reciprocal rights . These have not been granted , but three weeks ago New Zealand capitulated , gave Pan American exclusive permission to fly into New Zealand from the U. S. Immediately the world 's No. i airline swung its efficient organization into action . <P> Up from San Francisco climbed a brand new Sikorsky S-42B flying boat named the Pan American Clipper after the sister ship which made the tests on the central Pacific service . In command as always when Pan American starts a new project was its taciturn senior pilot , Captain Edwin C. Musick . With a six-man crew he buzzed uneventfully to Honolulu , slowing down to let Amelia Earhart pass undisturbed . From Honolulu , few days after Miss Earhart crashed ( TIME . March 29 ) , Capt . Musick again soared into the sky . this time turned southwest and faced the world 's most ticklish navigation problem- that of finding a speck of land 120 ft. long , 90 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no plane had ever seen . This tiny spot is Kingman Reef , discovered some 80 years ago by Captain John Kingman of the U. S. schooner Shooting Star . Other ships occasionally spotted it afar , but not until 1921 was it officially recorded by the U. S. S. Eagle .
