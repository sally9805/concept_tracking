txt The Merchants Association of New York and the Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York , through their presidents , a &; vised employers yesterday not to take advantage of the Supreme Court 's NRA decision to reduce wages and increase working hours . Louis K. Comstock , president of the Merchants Association , counseled the association 's members through their official bulletin , Greater New York , to make no changes in hour or wage schedules until the industrial situation was clarified . Lawrence B. Elliman spoke for the State Chamber , of which he is president , in a forum discussion over WOR with Joseph P. Ryan , president of the Central Trades and Labor Council , and Jacob J. Javits , attorney . Mr. Ryan warned that labor " can not , will not and should not stand for lowered wages and increased working hours , " and that millions of workers would rally to an American Federation of Labor call for a ' general strike in fortyeight States  --  a step which , according to Mr. Ryan , labor does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor to " shudder . " Mr. Javits proposed that Congress by legislation grant immunity from anti-trust laws to employers engaged directly or indirectly in interstate commerce who would agree not to engage in specified unfair methods of competition . In his statement to members of the Merchants Association , Mr. Comstock said : " Because of the wide divergence of opinion that existed among our members , the Merchants Association refrained from taking any position either for or against the extension of the NIRA . " It appears , however , that there are a very large number of business men who feel that the program of shorter hours and increased wages brought about by the NRA has been of benefit in promoting employment and the expenditure of money for consumer goods . " I am glad , therefore , to endorse the appeal of employers made by Harper Sibley , president of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States . I definitely suggest that employers should not make changes in hour and wage schedules until the situation is clarified . I believe this should be the policy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there will be . no hasty action in discarding those features of the NRA which are constructive . The Supreme Court decision has given to business the opportunity to prove that , with liberty of action , it will function efficiently , noci with the , best interests of the country . in mind . I believe that business will live up to its responsibilities . " Elliman Predicts Cooperation . In his address , Mr. Elliman said : " I am firmly convinced that American industry will meet this new test successfully and will demonstrate through the maintenance of present wage and hour schedules that it has the vision and foresight and decency to do these things without any threat of criminal prosecution . " The ruthless exploitation of labor , sweatshop operations , child labor , unendurable working hours and starvation wages were never typical of American business , They were the product of a very small minority of business men , estimated at 10 per cent of the whole . " The decent labor and competitive standards maintained in this country prior to the depression were the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the result ' of any compulsion by ilaw or otherwise . " There is absolutely no ' reason why American industry ' can not maintain the standards which have been in existence for the past two years without the compulsion of law . The question today is Whether , as business men , we can be trusted to treat labor fairly and to assure a decent standard ? of living , or whether it is necessary by foie of law to compel us to do these things . " It is probably not too much to say that the very ' future of our industrial history will depend largely upon the immediate conduct of American business men in meeting this crisis : " Ryan . Warns of Labor 's Stand . Mr. Ryan , speaking for labor , said : " Unless something is done , and done immediately , to retain the gains made by labor , labor will be forced to act on its own behalf . Labor can not permit the gains made so slowly in the past two years to be wiped out with one fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labor does not wish to threaten , it does not wish to go on strike , but it will not permit itself to be subjugated , to be crushed , and to be pushed aside . " The American Federation of Labor has a present membership of 7,500,000 people , in addition to which there are millions more who would rally to its call . The threat of a general strike is not a pleasant thought . That which happened in California can be made to happen in forty-eight States . It is not something that we wish . It is something at the thought of which we shudder . " But labor will not permit the gains of the last few years to come to naught . It will not permit industry to work employes longer hours than the codes have stated ; it will not permit wages to be cut ; it will not permit a return of child labor ; it will not permit a return to sweatshop conditions . " My plea is not to labor as much as it is to industry . We need your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not get along without us . You must have our help , our cooperation . " I ask labor to remember that this is a period of transition  --  a difficult period , in which labor must keep - its head and help those who wish to help , Labor must not grow impatient . They know we will not permit  --  their rights to be infringed upon . We ask labor to let us know when and where they hear of hours being increased or wages being reduced . " Voluntary codes are not , the answer , and it should be realized that they can be , a very bad . stopgap until legislation is enacted . Legislation must be enacted speedily . " If the Supreme Court is to continue to be the sole tribunal- to decide the constitutionality of all Federal legislation , then a method must be set up by which all Federal legislation must be submitted to it immediately upon its passage and before it is adopted , so that the whole American people will not be placed in the ridiculous position that they are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States for two years before Chief Justice , Hughes and his colleagues tell us something which they were evidently aware of at the time . " Dr. E , E. Pratt , former chief of the Bureau et Foreign and Domestic Commerce of the Department of Commerce , who is engaged in trade association and code administrative work , declared the Supreme Court decision had pointed definitely the road to . recovery through cooperative effort among industrialists and business men , for which Congress should frame the necessary legislation . Lucius Boomer , president of the Hotel Waldorf-Astoria Corporation , announced that there would be no change in the scale of wages and hours for employes of the Waldorf-Astoria . Mr. Boomer made the statement in response to inquiries concerning reports that some of the larger hotels would reestablish the seven-day week and reduce wages . The throwing . industry , embracing more than 200 Companies - With 340 mills in twenty-three " States , producing silk and rayon yarns for hosiery and weaving manufacturers , has agreed to maintain NRA wage and hour provisions for at least thirty days , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was announced by H. E. Bishop , executive secretary of the Throwsters Research Institute .
