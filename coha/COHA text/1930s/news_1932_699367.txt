txt The deciding battle in the wet campaign for liquor legislation at the present session of Congress opened today when the House took up the Collier bill for 4 per cent beer . Its passage by the lower chamber was accepted as a fofegone conclusion , but its ultimate fate was anybody 's guess , with both sides confident that preliminary maneuverings and carefully planned strategy made ultimate victory certain . The differences between House and Senate rules and President Hoover 's known desire to secure additional tax legislation and a balanced budget before his term of office expires were controlling elements behind the scenes as the debate began , which is expected to end in a vote Wednesday night before Congress adjourns for the Christmas recess on Thursday . Wets were understood to have planned insertion of numerous additional revenue features , including a general sales tax and extension of the one-year federal gasoline tax in the-Senate , where flexible rules permit any amendment to a revenue measure which adds to the federal income . Drys Hope to Make Changes Before it leaves the House , drys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will refuse to accept the measure . Amendments they plan to offer would redfice the percentage to the original 2.75 by weight and would prohibit its sale except in restaurants or for private home consumption . In its preliminary House stages the measure has been carefully limited to the one item of beer . This has been done to prevent its being loaded down with absurd revenue amendments which would make its ultimate defeat certain . Under House rules a bill providing for one tax is not a general revenue measure and other taxes can not be added . But in the Senate it will be open for all revenue amendments , which the House will not be privileged to reconsider when it returns . it will simply have to accept or reject the entire bill , and it is assumed the desire for beer legislation will out weigh the manufacturers ' excise items which are expected to be added . These additional revenue Items will also provide the bait with which wets hope to tempt President Hoover . If they offer him boor in the form of a general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they believe it will overcome ? his I scruples on the nullification implied 1n 4 per cent beer . Catering to President A consideration which might induce the President to follow this line is the understanding which will be , reached in the House Ways and Means Committee to bring out more revenue legislation at this session of Congress . As such legislation must originate with It , , it means that the beer bill is the only vehicle which can be used for extending the special manufacturers ' excise levies passed at the lad session for a one-year period only . Unless such a course is taken the special nuisance taxes in the present tax bill will expire on June 30 , 1933 and the Treasury will have to fall back on the provisions of the former act , which has proven inadequate under existing economic conditions . Despite these considerations drys are determined that beer shall not be legalized as a result of the action of the present Congress . They maintain that beer of the strength provided in the Collier bill-3.2 per cent by weight , or 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even be considered by Congress as long as the Eighteenth Amendment remains the fundamental prohibition law of the nation . Have Some Wet Support In this they arc supported by a considerable number of legislators who favor repeal of the amendment . but who are unwilling to be a party to nullification . Dry strategy contemplates amend- ments to reduce the strength of beer in the bill froth 32 to 2.75 as originally provided ; to increase the tax from $5 a barrel to $7.50 ; to limit legal ingredients to domestic produce ; to increase license fees and to prevent the return of the saloon by prohibiting sale of beer except in bottled form , and then only to restaurants and for home consumption . If they fail in securing beer , wets still have recourse to elimination of appropriations for prohibition enforcement In their drive for some action at the present session . But they have so loudly proclaimed their certainty of securing beer before March 4 that failure on this score would be a serious blow to their prestige and morale . It would be interpreted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeal and might well provide the beginning for a swing of the prohibition pendulum back in the dry direction .
