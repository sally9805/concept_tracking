LIFE in Soviet Russia had to become very different before Stalin could clasp the hand of Nazi Ger- many and engage in expansion . Foreign policy mirrors domestic conditions . The Russo-German pact and the events that flowed from it can only be fully understood against the background of new Soviet internal developments , which will be discussed in the third article of this series . But to enable Germany and Russia to march together , the  --  etamorphosis inside Russia had to synchronize with equally great changes outside  --  changes which produced the present European war . It was the war against the Nazi aggressor that made Bolshevik aggression possible . This is the clue to the pact and to the entire altered relationship between Germany and Russia . The international scene is a giant jigsaw puzzle . When one piece falls out of place , all the other pieces move . While England and France allowed Germany to win victories in Spain , Austria , and Czechoslovakia , Hitler played up the Bolshevik menace in order to prevent a bloc of the Western powers and Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more concessions from England and France , he turned to Russia . The Soviet government had for years sought to win England and France to an anti-Nazi policy . It feared a combination of England , France , and Germany which might be directed against Russia . But when the mounting antagonism between the two democracies and Germany ruled out such a combination , Russia 's fear of Germany vanished . The Russo-German pact of August 23 , 1939 , was not signed by Moscow for self-defense . The champions of the new Bolshevik-Nazi relationship contend that but for the pact Germany , having invaded Poland , would have marched into Soviet territory and engaged the Soviet Union in a war . This argument has no validity . If Hitler was certain that England and France would not honor their pledge to Poland and would not go to war , why should he have been prepared to share Poland with Russia ? Why make his anti-Bolshevik crusade look so ludicrous ? Hitler was not so confident of ChamberlainDaladier appeasement as he had been in 1938 . He needed Moscow to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and if war came , he did n't want Moscow to be an enemy . For these favors he was willing to pay Moscow , and he did pay . You do not pay a fellow because you are not going tohit him . Hitler did not intend to strike at Russia . No self-defense on Russia 's part was necessary . Suppose that on September 15 , when Polish resistance collapsed , the Allies had not been at war with Germany . Despite the pact with Moscow , Hitler could have kept right on going into Russian territory . The pact is only a piece of paper , not a protection . Why did he not attack Russia ? Because he had to turn around and face the Allies in the west . It was Moscow 's conviction that the Allies would fight , and not the fear that they would not , which brought about the pact . If the Russians had been worried about a German attack , they would have sought safety with the Allies . They would never have trusted themselves alone with Germany in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied with a war in Western Europe . Thus , as long as the followed a policy of appeasement and surrender to the fascist aggressors , the Bolsheviks were pro-Ally . And the moment the Allies took a firm stand against a fascist aggressor , the Bolsheviks made a pact with him . That is what is called dialectics . There will be an endless and fruitless debate on whether Stalin fooled Hitler or Hitler fooled Stalin . Stalin and Hitler entered into their partnership for the mutual benefits they thought it would bring them . No one expects altruism from statesmen . What looks like idealism in foreign policy is often merely a long view of selfish ends . If Stalin and Hitler were serving their countries ' best interests they were entitled to act as they did . But human beings make mistakes . Unless Stalin is invested with the infallibility which some Communists ascribe to him , and unless one says mystically that a socialist state can do no wrong , one must assume that he may have blundered . The Kaiser did not intend to ruin Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruin it . Chamberlain thought that the Munich surrender to Germany in September , 1938 , would bring " peace for our time . " Look at that peace now . Perhaps Stalin made a mistake . Lenin committed errors and admitted them . In 1920 the Poles invaded the Soviet Ukraine and captured Kiev . Soon , however , the Red Army drove them back into Poland . A violent controversy broke out in Moscow . Should the Soviet forces pursue the fleeing Polish army and seize all of Poland ? Lenin said yes , and . Stalin agreed . Trotsky had no enthusiasm for the yenDecember 30 , 1939 hire , but its most outspoken opponent was Radek , brilliant Soviet publicist , himself a Pole , who argued that if the Russian troops remained poised on the Soviet frontier the Polish workers and peasants , encouraged by the Red Army 's proximity , would rise in a revolt which the demoralized Polish troops could not crush . On the other hand , the penetration of the hated Russians into Poland would kindle Polish nationalism and enable Pilsudski to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view , however , was rejected . Lenin even quarreled with Radek and broke off relations with him . The Red Army did invade Poland , General Tukhachevsky , a Bolshevik military genius of twenty-seven , leading the advance on Warsaw , and Budenny and Stalin commanding a cavalry force in the direction of Lvov . Then exactly what Radek had prophesied happened . The Red Army was thrown back from the gates of Warsaw , and the revolution did not materialize . Once , late at night , Lenin went to the telephone and called Radek , and said , You were right ; I was wrong ; come to see me . Lenin subsequently told the whole story to Clara Zetkin for publication . Perhaps Stalin erred again where Lenin and he erred before  --  on the question of Poland . THE PACT : AN UNMIXED BOON FOR THE NAZIS The entire subject of Russo-German relations should be examined dispassionately on the basis of what has already occurred . Hitler knew that Germany lost the first World War because it had to fight on two fronts , Every German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if compelled to cope with the Anglo-French forces in the west and the Russians in the east . The Kaiser started with enough resources and allies to withstand this formidable Triple Entente for several years . Hitler was less fortunately situated in 1939 . And he was intent on avoiding the fate of the Kaiser . By signing with Russia he has eliminated it as a potential pro-Ally belligerent . He is now engaged in a one-front war . In other circumstances Hitler might not have gone to war . The pact with Russia makes all the vast difference to Germany between certain defeat and a chance of success . Nothing that Hitler has yielded to Russia can compare even remotely in importance with this advantage . Hitler had a second motive in concluding his treaty with the Kremlin . He hoped for Russian supplies to facilitate the prosecution of the war . In this he is likely to meet considerable disappointment . Russian materials can not offset the strangling effect of the Allied blockade . We know little about German internal conditions , and some observers are prone to exaggerate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acute shortages in Germany ' of fats , copper , and petroleum  --  all , indispensable td the conduct of a war . It was the scarcity of fats in 191748 which undermined Ger729 many 's resistance . Fats are not only necessary nourishment ; they are the basic ingredient of soap  --  already doled out in a niggardly ration in Germany  --  and an element in munitions . Russia , however , lacks sufficient fats and meat to feed its own population . Russia imports ' copper and therefore can not export any . It also imports such vital non-ferrous armament metals as lead , zinc , nickel , and antimony . Russia is the world 's second-largest oil-producing nation . But its home consumption has mounted with domestic industrialization and motorization , and its exports to all countries , under commercial contracts which it must honor , constitute only a small fraction of Germany 's war-time oil deficit . What Russia has to sell  --  grain , for instance ? Germany still possesses in adequate quantities . With Russia 's increased military expenditures in Finland it will have still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Germany ? The disintegration of the anti-Comintern bloc is not one of them . That Italian-German-Japanese partnership was based on the correct assumption that each act of aggression would smooth the path to the next act of aggression . Mussolini was encouraged to invade Abyssinia by the pusillanimity of England and France in China . The supineness of the British and French governments on the Spanish issue conduced to the brazenness of Hitler toward Czechoslovakia . Successful fascist violence bred contempt . It worked in peace time . But war has changed all that . For Japan and Italy to collaborate with Germany now means to fight , and that is very costly and therefore very unattractive . Japan rejected a military alliance with Germany before the Russo-German pact was negotiated . Italy has waged two wars recently , in Ethiopia and Spain , and can not at present afford a third . With the war in its current " sea and air " phase , Italy and Spain would be smashed if they moved to help Germany . This , and not the Russo-German pact , is what shattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Poland of no great economic value , and has retired from certain positions in the Baltic states , where it had no territory but where German immigrants had established cultural and business stakes . The Russian shadow has lengthened over the Balkans . Yet when a nation gambles for its life as Germany is doing , these are small considerations compared with the benevolent neutrality of a tremendous country like Russia . The arrangement between Germany and Russia also has social implications . The bolshevization of Germany looms slightly larger as a prospect . But that could arise solely in case of a German defeat or from a desperate effort to stave off such a defeat  --  the Allies would then seek to check the upheaval  --  and it is typical of the Hitler regime that its leaders proceed on the principle " After us the deluge . " What have they to lose from bolshevization , if they first lose their power and position ? For the purposes of the war the pact with Russia is an unmixed boon to the Nazis . RUSSIA AND THE WESTERN POWERS But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapprochement with Germany ? We judge a man by the friends he keeps , by what he does , and by the way he talks . Nations too are judged by these criteria . Russia wanted the friendship of Great Britain , France , and America . Now its spokesmen and press attack those powers . At the same time it collaborates with Germany and defends Nazi policies and acts . Russia had never occupied the territory of other nations after the fashion of Germany , Italy , and Japan . Now it has . Russia had consistently condemned aggression and defended the rights of small countries . Today the Soviets are talking a very different language . Moscow has abandoned every tradition of Soviet foreign policy and discarded the principles of Lenin , Chicherin , and Litvinov which once guided that policy . Russia has swapped streams . Soviet relations with the outside world divide into three parts : between 1917 and 1920 Russia was invaded by foreign nations ; between 1921 and 1938 it was not invaded ; in 1939 it invaded other countries . In 1931 occurred the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan attacked China . Moscow 's sympathies were with China . In the years that followed , Moscow opposed every attempt to modify existing territorial conditions . The symbol of that opposition was the Soviet government 's adherence to the League of Nations . Moscow joined with alacrity in anti-Italian sanctions because it did not wish to see aggression elevated into a principle . It saw its own safety in a punitive League which could teach transgressors a respect for international law . Its policy was peace , and " peace , " as Litvinov first said , " is indivisible . " The years 1936 , 1937 , and 1938 were the dark age of appeasement . The democracies helped every aggressor and helped no victim of aggression . Moscow was the only effectively anti-fascist government in the world . In China and Spain the Soviet government was actually protecting the British and French empires . It had no objection to doing so because it regarded these ancient agglomerations as stabilizing influences . They were sated , conservative , and unambitious , and therefore no danger to world peace or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , the Third International preached , " is war . " The assumption of Soviet policy vis-a-vis Spain and China was that Moscow would support them until the British and French finally woke up to a realization of where their true interests lay and themselves took over the onerous burden of rescuing these weak states from the assaults of rapacious imperialists . Stalin was concerned lest repeated fascist victories undermine the morale , stamina , and strategic strength of the democracies , who were the natural allies of Russia against an expanding Germany and Japan . Anti-fascism was good power politics in addition to being congenial to the Soviet public . The Western powers , nevertheless , slept in naive self-assurance . Anglo-French policy in Spain and the unnecessary capitulation on Czechoslovakia at Munich in September , 1938 , buried many Soviet hopes . The Soviet leaders wondered if the West would ever rouse itself to resistance . The Kremlin began to ask itself whether the progressive forces in democratic countries were worth-while allies . Loyalist Spain , for instance , had rallied to its standard many friends in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from left to right , the Communists , the Socialists and labor elements , most liberals , many conservative Protestants , and a large number of prominent conservative politicians . Yet these alignments failed to budge any one of the three democratic governments a single inch in the direction of a more pro-Loyalist policy . Chamberlain and Daladier were firmly intrenched , and they persisted in yielding to the aggressors . Moscow believed that the British and French governments wished to channel fascist aggression toward Soviet territory . Still Moscow paid court to the Western powers . Soviet aid to the Loyalists continued until January , 1939 , when Catalonia was still receiving arms ; and Moscow was ready to assist the republic in prolonging resistance in the central Madrid zone even after the Catalan collapse . Then Hitler revolutionized European diplomatic relationships ; German troops entered Prague on March 15 , 1939 , and annexed the Czechoslovak rump . This was reveille . That day Chamberlain made a statement in the House of Commons . He admitted two days later in a speech at Birmingham that this statement was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a , misapprehension . " " Some people , " he added , " thought that because I spoke quietly , because I gave little expression to feelDecember 30 , 1939 ing , therefore my colleagues and I did not feel strongly on the subject . I hope to correct that mistake tonight . " He did . What had happened was a revolt in the Con- ' servative Party against Chamberlain 's " cool and objective " reaction to the demise of Czechoslovakia . The British were alarmed . The people called for action . The French saw danger looming . Hitler turned the Reichswehr toward Poland . If Poland were lost , France would be the next victim . Chamberlain was prodded from be- , hind . This was the development which Moscow had hoped for and worked toward through all the years of collective security and the popular front . The goal of those policies was a coalition of imperialists and antifascist , democratic , League of Nations elements which would compel the Western governments to stem aggression . It had arrived . Now the Soviet government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely at this moment of victory that Moscow contemplated dropping both policies  --  the-popular front and collective security . - The result of the new spirit in London , and Paris was the British guaranty to Poland on March 31 , 1939 , to fight Germany in case Germany assaulted Polish independence . That day is the historic dividing line in the post-war ( pre-war ) history of Europe . " It must be admitted , " Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Molotov said in Moscow on May 31 , " that the mutual-assistance pact between Britain and Poland alters the European situation . . . . There are a number of signs that the democratic countries of Europe are coming to realize that the non-intervention policy has collapsed . " Appeasement was dying . And the end of appeasement was the beginning of the Russo-German pact . By giving pledges of protection to Poland and subsequently to Rumania the British and French were actually undertaking to protect the western frontier of Russia . The guaranties to Poland and Rumania were ipso facto guaranties to the Soviet government . Accordingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government in Moscow about a mutual-assistance treaty , the Russians felt that they had already received from England for nothing almost everything that England could give them . The guaranties to Poland and Rumania came too quickly for the successful con ( i duct of the conversations with Moscow . Now if the British desired help from the U. S. S. R. they had to offer something over and beyond the guaranties of the Soviet-Polish and Soviet-Rumanian frontiers . Moscow asked concessions in the Baltic area . The stubborn resistance of Finland to Russia 's demands suggests that it would have been extremely difficult for England to persuade the three other Baltic states ? Lithuania , Latvia , and Estonia  --  to accept the infringement of their sovereignty which Moscow later wrung from them under the threat of force . 731 Molotov had the bargaining advantage because England , now more hostile to Germany , needed Russia 's friendship . Thus the negotiations were ill-starred from their inception : one party was minus its major trumps , the promises to Poland and Rumania ; the second party insisted on something which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guaranteed the Baltic states as they had Poland and Rumania against foreign attack . But Russia wanted more ; it wanted to be able to check " indirect aggression " or a change of regime inside its small neighbors which it might deem a threat even if no foreign power moved . Since Moscow was necessarily to be the judge as to whether " indirect aggression " had occurred , the Soviet government would be in a position at any time to march in and assume control of the four Baltic countries . It is obvious therefore that Russia was asking England to obtain for it what Germany subsequently gave it . The crux of the entire Russo-German pact is that the guaranty to Poland was the reverse of " Munich . " If the purpose of Munich was to direct German expansion eastward against the Soviet Union , then the British pledge to Poland was insane , certainly inconsistent . Had the Allies wished Germany to attack Russia they would have said : " This is fine . Hitler is preparing to invade Poland . Let him . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Instead they said , " If Hitler attacks Poland , we fight " ( the present war is adequate proof that they meant it ) ; and in all the talks with Moscow the British and French governments assured the Kremlin that they would not expect Russia to enter the war before they did . The Bolsheviks consequently decided that since the Allies would create a western front against Germany , Russia would lose nothing from the proximity of Germany or from a German advance into Poland . On August 22 , the day before the pact was signed , Neville Chamberlain wrote a letter to Hitler , now printed in the British " Blue Book , " in which he said : " Whatever may prove to be the nature of the German-Soviet agreement , it can not alter Great Britain 's obligation to Poland . . . which they are determined to fulfil " ; and he cautioned Hitler that " it would be a dangerous illusion to think that , if war once starts , it will come to an early end even if a success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be engaged should have been secured . " This warning was intended to deter Hitler . But the British attitude it enunciated reassured Moscow . The new Allied policy had a double motivation : ( 1 ) Poland was the last pro-Ally satellite in Eastern Europe . Its disappearance would weaken the Western powers and finally convince Hitler of his invincibility. ( 2 ) The annihilation of Poland would bring Germany into contact with Russia . That might precipitate a war between them , but since Russia was weaker than Germany , it would ' also present the dreaded prospect of collaboration between them . 732 The present war is the logical consequence of the British pledge to Poland . Moscow saw this coming . It gave Russia a freedom of choice . Before that Russia could only have been pro-Ally . Now it had an alternative . Allied hostility to Germany and the scrapping of Munichism allowed Russia to be pro-German . If Russia sided with the Allies it would have to participate in a war in case one came , but without obtaining what it coveted in Poland and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sided with Germany , it could remain aloof from the major conflict and yet gather booty outside its territory . These considerations disrupted the Anglo-Soviet negotiations , not petty questions of rank , mandates , and diplomatic niceties . Had Stalin been eager for an agreement with The NATION the British , but on better terms , he would have negotiated openly with Germany . That would have constituted pressure on London . But the talks with Germany were secret . Downing Street knew nothing about them . Instead , to extract better conditions from the Germans , the Russians negotiated openly with the British . Great Britain thus helped Russia to obtain more from Germany . The Anglo-Soviet negotiations were doomed from the start to failure . Not only did Strang waste his time . Halifax himself would have wasted his time . Mr. Fischer 's second article , dealing with the negotiations that led up to the Russo-German pact and with the trend of Russia 's new foreign policy , will appear next week.               @ @ @ @ @ @
