TRANQUILLITY NOTE : The other morning a fun-loving member of one of the large downtown banking houses turned off the stock ticker , in a moment of jest . The jest went off faintly . It was three hours before anyone noticed it . TECHNOLOGICAL NOTE : When we suggested to the Burlington Railroad recently that they hire idle college graduates to swab the dirty sides of the Zephyr , we had a secret fear that some inventor would read our paragraph . That is exactly what happened . There is a machine now for washing the dirty sides of trains : the Erie is using one in Jersey City ( Spotless Town ) on the dirty sides of their unstreamlined but fastidious locomotives ? the kind that go chu chu chu , ff f000000 . WE hope The Surrey , residential hotel at No. 20 East Seventy-sixth Street , did n't order any large amount of their embossed stationery . Sooner or later somebody ( somebody besides us ) is going to notice the beautifully embossed line " ADJOURNING FIFTH AVENUE , " and then the management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anywhere else but in the East Seventies you could keep it and use it . years ago this week The New Yorker put in an appearance , and the town was yellow with the dust of butterfly wings . That was a sound , hopeful winter in the island , when , if you ordered orange juice , it was brought to you without a collar of foam on it from an electric squeezer . Hylan was mayor . New York was an oligarchy , and the local population was well taken care of by direct political methods , rather than by relief . James J. Walker was the minority leader in the state senate . The clamburger had not appeared on roadside stands . A lot of people who are now dead were then alive and well . Flo Ziegfeld was putting on the " Follies " and using the word " glorification .

Gregory Kelly , our favorite actor , was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling to Louis Wolheim " Wait for Baby ! " nightly at the Plymouth . People were going down to the Neighborhood Playhouse for drama of the esoteric sort , and the morning IV oriel was campaigning against dirty shows , on the page opposite Heywood Braun . When you took a cab , the meter began at 15 cents . Motorcars were high-ceilinged and easy to get in and out of . Enright was police commissioner , and everybody was trying to get distant points on the radio and to solve the crossword puzzles in the puzzle books published by a couple of visionaries named Simon and Schuster . President Coolidge rose early , mounted his electric horse , and led the country through a thrifty morning-time . The antitoxin had been taken successfully to Nome . Here in town , people were telling their dreams to analysts , and the streets were full of little blue runabouts belonging to the Police Department , unequipped with radio and completely out of touch with crime .

Vomen were smoking in public places , quite brazenly . Jazz was regarded as respectable , and serious musicians discussed Gershwin gravely . Quite a chunk of the populace was away , in Palm Beach . The rest were at home , drinking in ill-ventilated restaurants called speakeasies , faintly excited at the possibility that the men at the next table were federal agents . A World Court Ball was in progress at the Plaza . Thus the decade . We feel old , not in years but in events . Too much has happened for the good of anyone . More seems likely to happen . Today , on our tenth anniversary , they are discovering that the more auto-mobiles are turned out , the fewer men are em-ployed . And they are fingerprinting John D. Rockefeller , Jr. , as though it were his fault . Only yesterday ; lunching in a mirrored grill , we overheard a man telling about a new way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tune the worm in and the apple out . Thinking of all these immediate matters , we dream of ten years ago , when a man 's only worry was that the world was coming to an end . Today it 's not as simple as that  --  obviously the end is not yet . ' To the next ten years ! Transport TRANSPORTATION stories continue to flow in , good , bad , and indifferent , like the transportation . An elderly and apparently unassertive lady tried to stop a bus on Fifth Avenue the other day , but without much success . Several times , as she stepped off the curb to signal , a car came along and frightened her hack , and the bus rolled by without stopping . One of our observers noticed her predicament and that she was about ready to cry with vexation , and was just going to do something about it when a whitewing , who had been quietly sweeping the gutter , noticed what was going on , and acted . lie stepped in front of the next bus and held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lady got on she said something in the way of thanks . The white-wing pulled off his hat and bowed . " It 's all part of our duty , lady , " he said , and went hack to sweeping . Then there is another item , about a bus and a large lady with an executive temperament and four children , who hoarded an uptown coach which was pretty well filled . She dispatched the young ones to odd seats here and there . When the conductor came along , she told him in crisp tones precisely where everyone was . A boy upstairs in a blue cap , a girl upstairs in a red coat , two boys downstairs , one there and one there . She put five dimes in the snatcher . " And , " she added , " that lady in green up front got on when we did . " Shy Little Thing ANY stories you hear about Elisa-beth Bergner 's shyness and aver-sion to publicity are pretty likely to be true . What convinced us was the alarm a friend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bergner is living . Miss Bergner would move , her friend said flatly , if her address became known , and this would he a pity , because she went through hell getting settled in New York . She wo n't eat in public , and she dislikes steam heat . She spent two miserable weeks waiting for her apartment to he made ready , sitting in a hotel room with the radiator turned off , browsing unhappily off trays , and wearing a fur coat . Added to these discomforts were her usual conviction that her opening was going to be a disastrous flop , and a hazy notion that she was in danger of being kidnapped by gangsters . She feels better now , though ; has an open fireplace and a big kitchen for her own Viennese cook , and " Escape Me Never ! " is doing well . She loves skating ; one of these crisp afternoons , if you were very , very lucky , you might see her skating in the Park  --  probably late on a matinee afternoon . She hates matinees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seclusion , she 'd have to keep pretty quiet , as she 's not very strong ( " About the size of a jonquil , " a sentimental friend of hers once remarked ) , and her stage work takes a lot out of her . She had to cut short the London run of " Escape Me Never ! , " while it was still playing to full houses , because of her health . She 's in fine fettle now , though , and does n't seem a hit bothered by the stiff schedule of work laid out ahead of her : twelve weeks at the Shubert , a movie version of " St. Joan , " and then a new Barrie play . She 's already studying the Barrie script . It 's a slight exaggeration to refer to her , as some of the newspapers did , as a refugee from Nazi Germany . She has n't been in Germany since 1930 , long before Der El - threes time . On the other hand , she probably could n't go back to Germany now . The film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catherine , opened in London last year at the Leicester Square Theatre while " Escape Me Never ! " was playing at the Apollo . A friend of ours was backstage , being introduced to Miss Bergner , when two frantic , white-tied film executives burst in upon them . " Catherine " was a great success , they shouted , and would n't Miss Bergner throw a fur coat over her costume and nip over to the Leicester Square to take a bow ? Miss Bergner 's eyes widened , as if she had been offered a grotesque and improper suggestion ; impossible , she said . But everybody was there , they told her the Austrian ambassador , and the Prince . " I think the whole idea is disgusting , " she said calmly , and that was that . About the only time Miss Bergner has made concessions to an admirer was when she first came to England , and Shaw wanted to see her . She had a cold . Shaw tried again the next week , and she had another cold . The third time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have the courage to say so . Shaw came to see her , and caught the cold . Table Manners APROWLER we know who goes around prying into nooks and crannies to see how people live dropped into a cheap coffee shop on Third Avenue one afternoon . A big truck-driver was sitting at the counter with a cup of coffee in front of him and a chocolate eclair in his left hand . Ile had just plunged the eclair into the coffee when the boss of the lunchroom , who was as big and as strong as the truckman , walked down behind the counter and spoke to him . " Listen , " he said . " In here , eclairs you do n't dunk . Dough nuts , yes . Eclairs , no . " That put a stop to that . Vegetables IN the corridor between the dining- I-room and the bar at the Hotel Madison , they 're unveiling this week the first of a series of so-called vegetable tableaux , or , more fancily , tableaux de legumes . We got an advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clever and colorful posing of vegetables in human and other forms . This first one has to do with St. Valentine 's Day and has doves in it . We happened to hear about this event when we went over to the offices of Vogue to ask about the results of a picture they had printed in their December 15th issue , a color photograph by Anton Bruehl of a creche ( a representation of the Three Kings visiting the Holy Family ) done entirely in vegetables . You may have seen it . The editors of Vogue accepted it , and then the trouble began . One member of the staff was horrified , and said so . Others joined her , and before long the office was divided bitterly into two camps . For days , they say , no one talked of anything else . The whole Conde Nast organization was drawn into it , including Mr. Nast himself and Mr. Crowninshield . The opposition granted that for centuries cr  --  ches had been made by peasants out of the humblest things , stones , hits of wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely impious . Vegetables were things you threw at people . The other side asserted that vegetables were miracles of life , like flowers . It finally was decided to consult the clergy , and accordingly the picture was shown to three of the highest local dignitaries of the Catholic Church . They all liked it , saying that no Catholic could object to it and that the question could come up only in this country . They advised Vague to go ahead , warning them merely to expect possibly some complaint from the Puritans . Well , it 's two months since the publication and but one letter has come in , from a lady who expressed mild surprise only . There are a couple of other stories in connection with the business . It seems that Scott Vilson , the artist who posed the vegetables in the first place , wanted to top off the turban on one of the Three Kings with a cranberry . ( The king was a small squash with a beet for a head and a mushroom turban . ) He made his creche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in season . He tried the A. &; P. , Washington Market , the Second Avenue pushcarts , and Charles without success . Finally he ended up at Shaffer 's on Madison Avenue , and there Mr. Shaffer himself admitted to having exactly one quart of cranberries , ordered specially and held for one of his best customers . He told Mr. Wilson to wait , disappeared into his storage vaults , and emerged with a single cranberry wrapped in tissue paper . When the Madison commissioned Wilson to do a series of tableaux , he was faced with the problem of fixing his vegetables so they would keep their shape and color . He did n't know of anything on the market to preserve them , but he thought painting them with liquid glass might do it . He wrote to the Corning Glass people , who turned him over to the research department of the du Ponts in Wilmington . There was certainly no one thing , the du Pont people said , which could be used on all vegetables , because of their varying chemical compositions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since then , they 've sent him various formulae for different vegetables , as proven . They have warned him against one thing , however : they 're convinced that nothing can be done about spinach . ? AMR . CULLEN telephoned us Wednesday afternoon to report that he had just been walking along fifty-seventh Street when a young woman approached with a violin case , and just as she got abreast of him the case came open and what seemed like a peck of potatoes rolled out onto the sidewalk . Mr. Cullen started to pick them up , but he 'd gathered only half a dozen or so by the time the girl had jumped into a taxicab and driven off . That 's all Mr. Cullen had to tell us . Heavy Water VOU may have been mildly bewil1 dered and agitated by the recent stories in the newspapers about a Professor Hansen in Oslo , Norway , who has been boldly drinking a substance called " heavy water . " Some scientists have ventured the opinion that the stuff might kill a man because it once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause laymen little uneasiness , because there 's not much heavy water in the world , and what there is costs around twelve hundred dollars a pint . This assurance was given us by a worried gentleman who went up to Columbia University to talk to Dr. Harold C. Urey about heavy water . Dr. Urey won the Nobel Prize last year for his discovery of heavy hydrogen , which makes the production of heavy water possible . Heavy water looks like plain , everyday water but weighs a little more , about ten per cent more . It consists of two parts heavy hydrogen ( called deuterium ) and one part oxygen , and its chemical symbol is D20 instead of H2O . Four years ago two professors in California , Birge and Menzel , monkeying around with hydrogen , announced that there were probably both light and heavy hydrogen atoms , but only one heavy one for every five thousand light ones . That started Dr. Urey to experimenting , and finally , by distilling liquid hydrogen and getting rid of the light hydrogen atoms through evaporation , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spectrograph , and thus became the discoverer of them . It took him seven months  --  from April to November , 1931 . Other scientists began experimenting for themselves , and in 1933 Dr. G. N. Lewis , in California , using electrolysis to remove the light atoms , produced water that was ninety-nine and nine-tenths heavy . It takes fifty to a hundred thousand gallons of ordinary water to make one gallon of heavy water . At first , heavy water was valued at seventy-five thousand dollars a gallon because it was so difficult to make , but now you can buy it for only ten thousand dollars a gallon . That 's because a fertilizer firm in Norway found that when it got through making fertilizer , the water it used was already part heavy water , so that it did n't take so much time and electricity to complete the work . This firm makes ninety-five per cent of all the heavy water that 's produced , and sells it for twelve hundred and fifty dollars for a five-hundred-gram lot ( about a pint ) . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nobody is sure yet what heavy water is good for or bad for  --  outside of the tact that it is had for guppies and certain vegetation . A Dr. Taylor at Princeton put a guppy in a small amount of the water and it died . Then Dr. Lewis , in California , put it on some plants and they died . As to whether it 's poisonous to man , the exasperating Philo Vance spoke truly ( " The Casino Murder Case , " p. 232 ) : " No one knows , do n't y ' know . It might be . No way of tellin ' yet . Intcrestin ' subject . . " Dr. Urey says that the small amounts  --  only ten grams  --  the Norwegian professor has been takin ' would n't do any harm anyhow . Maybe if a person substituted heavy water for all the water in his system ( seventy-five thousand grams ) , he would die , but nobody knows for sure . Interestin ' subject . Columbia University put in a plant for making heavy water a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy water have been produced there . The university buys slightly heavy water from a chemical company for twenty dollars a gallon and goes on from there . The process takes three hundred hours . Dr. Urey , who sailed for Sweden early this month , has not been doing any experiments with heavy water himself , but most of the other scientists at the university are . Dr. Urey is now trying to separate the light atoms of oxygen from the heavy atoms of oxygen . Heavy oxygen atoms were discovered nine years ago by Professors Giauque and Johnston in California , but nobody has done anything with them . Lothario AN intrepid young lady of New Jer-sey , who was making an afterdinner trip from Forty-second Street to the downtown Hudson Tubes via the Eighth Avenue subway the other night , looked up from her newspaper in mild surprise when the train came to a sud-den , between-stations stop just south of Canal Street . She was , she found , the only passenger in the frontmost car . As she stared around , the motorman , a good-look-ing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked straight over to where she was sitting . " You got a date tonight ? " he inquired . Quite aston-ished , she said she was afraid she had . The mo-torman did n't press her at all . " No hard feel-ings , " he said , went back where he belonged , and the train started moving again . Gunman IF you 've ever gone much to track meets , you 've seen Mr. John James ( Johnny ) McHugh , with his pistol and ( of evenings ) his derby hat and dinner jacket . People have told us that Johnny is the greatest starter of all time . As to his record of service , nobody ever heard of one that even approaches it : in the last thirty-seven years , he has started some two hundred and four thousand races , with an estimated total of five million runners . ( Some public-school events have two or three hundred entrants . ) You could figure out how long it would take these to pass a given point , and have an interesting statistic . Johnny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dash up , and he has officiated at indoor and outdoor meets at home and abroad  --  was the starter at the 1924 Olympic Games in Paris . Sometimes he gets a fee , sometimes not . He fires an average of six thousand cartridges every year and wears out two pistols . He uses a .22-calibre blank-cartridge pistol for indoor work and a .32 , which has a much louder hang , for outdoors . Never fired a real gun in his life , he told us proudly . Johnny began his career more or less by accident . He was putting on a track meet at the old Pastime A. C. , and when the regular starter did n't show up , Johnny filled in for him . ' fiat was in ' 98 , and he 's been at it ever since . Up to 1928 he averaged two hundred meets a year , The depression cut that " T hey used to be players . " figure to one hundred , but now things are looking up again . Nobody has ever been able to tell what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor just a matter of saying , " On your marks . Get set , " and pulling the trigger . There 's much more to starting than that . You could n't do it . You 've got to be steady as a rock , for one thing . Runners at important meets are always in a keyed-up , jittery state and it 's up to the starter to keep them under control . You have to work things so that the runners are all poised with equal firmness and hence will get away evenly . All the runners know Johnny and have confidence in him , and that is important . Once in a while he slips up , though : the cartridge does n't explode , or he 's forgotten to reload the pistol . You ca n't imagine what it does to an athlete 's system to hear a tiny click instead of an expected hang . Johnny was the first starter to stand ahead of the runners , instead of behind them . First time he did it was at a high-school track meet in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line ; he liked the new position so well that he 's used it ever since , and to do practically all the other starters . Johnny estimates that about ninety per cent of the official track records on file at the headquarters of the Amateur Athletic Union have his signature as starter . Of all the champions he hasseen , he admires most Nurmi and Paddock . He does n't think Paddock was especially fast on the getaway , though ; best in this department he ever saw was one Bill Easton , of Boston . Johnny never gets very far away from athletics ; his real job for the past twenty-eight years has been that of Athletic Inspector for the New York City Board of Education . Casting about for a few interesting anecdotes , we asked Johnny what was the very worst moment of his starting career . He told us . It was about what you 'd expect . Happened in 1912 , at a meet in the old Madison Square Garden . The best sprinters of that day were crouched on the line for the finals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Johnny , and then , " Get set . " Just as his finger tightened on the trigger , a man in one of the boxes barked , " Go ! " The memory makes Johnny shudder even now . " I give you my word , " he says solemnly , " if there had been real bullets in my pistol , I 'd have shot him dead . " Dolt ARIVERSIDE DRIVE lady of fine feelings tells us about a severe disappointment she has had . She 's always gone on the assumption that people in the humbler walks of Life have souls just like anybody else  --  her milkman , for example . And look what he did ! The other night she was feeling rather kindly toward him because she 'd found he 'd called fruitlessly during the afternoon with his bill when nobody was home , and she wrote him a poem , which she put in a milk bottle , along with his money . This was the poem : The milkman 's reply , found in the same bottle next morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Only $ 1.40 in the bottle . A dollar , a quarter , a dime , and a nickel .
