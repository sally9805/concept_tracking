txt Letters From Readers of the Times ARCHITECTURE IN THE MAKING Modern Design Here Held to Require American Background To the Editor of The New York Times ; In a survey of the progress of American architecture during the past half century it was recently stated through the columns of Tan TIMES that " architecture has become a combination of the arts and the sciences and not merely an expression of art . " This seems to be the equivalent of saying that American architecture has ceased to draw upon Old World sources in governing motif and is entering a renaissance period out of which will develop a basic root symbolic of a new form and design affecting all contemporary architecture . In other words , the acceptance by the architects of the interrelationship of science and art marks an epoch that truly may be said to have provided the foundation for a clearly defined school of ? American architecture  --  a dynamic school expressing an economic and cultural advance through the strength and utility of a natural line adapted to the newer materials , such as structural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In studying the evolution of American architecture the link between art and science seems to have been firmly welded through the pioneer research and achievement of city planning in defining the relation in the usage of urban land and urban space with respect to the social and hygienic welfare of the social structure . The milestone marking the progress within architectural practice was initiated by the late George B. Ford . who gave us zoning regulations and the so-called " set-back " form of construction . New York 's Skyline . The adaptation of these two fundamental ideas permitted the architect the creation of new forms in such a way that the silhouette of the skyline of New York City is now taking the shape of superimposed horizontal structural areas by means of which the height and bulk of the city is rising and becoming orientated within controlled stages of construction and basic structural form . The practical significance of the movement is clear when we consider that it has been the means of release for the individual architect to acquire creative expansion for his form and design , for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vertical content of his project form as a finite unit , since he knows that both the land and the space occupied can be made to conform with a horizontally regulated scheme in effect within the particular zone in which he is working , and , in turn , assimilated within the growing plan of the city as a whole . A New Profession . While city planning has not yet acquired the dignity of an exact science , the relation of city planning to structural and municipal engineering is so close we seem to be gradually developing a new professional branch which can only be classified as that of architectural engineering . This step int , advance , however , seems to require a background of experience and training uniquely and dynamically American . Its postulates , premises and hypotheses are so closely linked to the science of mathematical physics , it is an obvious deduction that the physical correlation of architectural form with design has already been included within the American scene , and that the interdependence of art to science within the field of architecture is a scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of art that is consistently and absolutely American in its origin . GERALD PRESTON HERSEY. , Ridgefield , Conn. , Sept. 30 , 1930 . CRITICIZES MR . DURANTY . To the Editor of The New York Times : Though I doubt if you will print this letter , I nevertheless must express my indignation and protest against the report of Mr. Duranty dated Sept. 26 . A handful of people have made a slaughterhouse of a country with 150,000,000 people . That bloody demonstration is spreading poison and decay all over the world . calling into existence monsters like Italian , German and Austrian Fascism , China 's banditism , Palestine pogroms and other dark forces . Looking over this morning 's TIMES , one comes to the conclusion that there is no tranquil , safe , light spot on the globe today , including the United States . Of course , I do not ascribe all the evils of our present social life to the " Red menace . " But the question is , What is the right way to solve these evils ? Is it by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Then , Is it not high time to understand that there can be no compromise between the two ways ? Is it not high time to understand , as well , that it is foolish . stupid and criminal to say that while America and Europe may be run by democratic principles , Russia , Italy or any other country should be cured by dictatorial methods ? But Mr. Duranty seems to think otherwise . He is trying to bring together his native capitalistic and democratic country with a country which is dreaming of establishing an international cheka . I think no intelligent man would behave himself in a foreign country as Mr. Duranty does . It is especially inadmissible for a correspondent of one of the best , greatest and most influential papers in the world . M. WEINSTEIN . New York , Sept. 28 , 1930 .

However , in another respect she may be able to establish a record of her own . Mr. Mikimoto , the Japanese leader of the culture pearl industry , is planning to build a high tower on the summit of Mount Asakuma , itself 2,000 feet high , near the sacred imperial shrines ' of Ise . He is not erecting that tower for a record in height , but as a ' pinnacle for pearls . It is to cover and protect a million pearls , worth 100,000 , - 000 yen , or $50,000,000 , which are to be deposited there and topped by that tower . They are to be " kept for the people of a hundred years hence .

PAKTONG A RARE OLD ALLOY Articles Made of This Eighteenth Century Metal Bring High Prices To the Editor of The New York Times : Probably few of your readers have ever heard of paktong , or tutenag , an exceedingly rare eighteenth century . English alloy which In its day was considered only less precious than gold and silver , and was accordingly cast and finished by expert metal workers after the finest designs of the period . The ability to recognize and identify this silver-white metal may , however , prove of real advantage to the layman , for a number of excellent examples of paktong candlesticks , fire grates and fenders have been brought to the United States in recent years , and their value , because of their beauty and rarity , is high . That these pieces should have passed into the hands of owners who are unaware of their importance is to be expected , for two reasons : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paktong and , second , because old paktong candlesticks were subsequently silverplated by those ignorant of their worth , and paktong fire grates were sometimes covered with stove polish or black lead by those who felt that a " silver " grate was not in style . Although some ingenuity may be required to rediscover specimens of paktong , it is well worth the effort , for if investigation of some blackened Adam-style grate ( all paktong grates are of this design ) reveals the glisten and glitter of silvery paktong , the owner might well refuse $1,000 for his " find . " Paktong was the first good imitation of silver produced in England . It predates German silver about seventy or eight years and britannia metal about forty . It resembles " sterling " so closely that in some instances the difference is indistinguishable by the eye alone . One reason so little is known about this metal is that paktong pieces were produced only for a brief period , 1750 to 1800 . There is no record of paktong being made , even at the beginning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " white copper " native to China rather than the alloy we now know it to be , and one of the reasons given why its manufacture was discontinued is that the Chinese Government forbade its export . Origin a Mystery . Until recently the very name " paktong " has been in dispute . The metal was called " tutenag " in England and was also popularly known by a meaningless corruption . of this name ? " tooth and egg " metal . In fact , the ls-T origin , composition and history of paktong is so shrouded in mystery that there are probably not more than a dozen dealers in all of London who can give any information regarding this old English alloy beyond that relating to its rarity and antiquity . Although most paktong is of museum calibre , practically all paktong pieces listed by collectors are privately held . The Victoria and Albert Museum in South Kensington , England , however , exhibits a number of fine paktong candlesticks , and our own Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City has purchased an of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarest and finest of any work in paktong is exemplified by the firegrates and fenders . An idea of their present value may be gained by the record of a paktong grate which was originally sold for 100 guineas in 1771 and was offered at $1,000 in 1860 . When held by dealers ignorant of their importance , paktong candlesticks may sometimes be purchased for $20 or $25 a ' pair , but those who know the scarcity of paktong or are competent to estimate value from quality of design , realize that they are worth several times this figure . Paktong is a silver-white alloy of copper , nickel and zinc . It is very hard and tough and for this reason paktong pieces are rarely found bent , dented or scratched . Paktong resists corrosion far better than silver , brass or copper . When allowed to tarnish the oxide formed on the surface is of a very pale greenish-brown color and , once formed , remains about the same shade . Paktong can be cleaned quite easily , however , and when well polished becomes a brilliant silverywhite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maker 's Marks . Specimens of paktong which have been assayed show a composition which accounts for the fact that while some pieces are as white as silver others have a faint yellowish , greenish or bluish cast . This difference is usually so'slight , however , I that it can most readily be detected only by comparison with silver itself . One of the tests that help identify paktong is the clear , bell-like ring which is heard when the hollow base of a paktong caadlestick is struck . ' In fact , even the solid shapes give a distinctively musical sound when this Itest is applied . Paktong candlesticks bear no maker 's marks of any kind . They may be engraved with the owner 's initials or crests underneath the base or on the collar or base , but if the piece shows assay office marks or maker 's initials , impressed or done in the casting , you can be sure that it is German silver of an early Victorian date rather than paktong . Paktong was always cast in a mold and finished by hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface of the metal underneath or inside the base of paktong candlesticks was nearly always scraped or chiseled away to remove the roughness left in the casting ; whereas in the German silver sticks this was invariably left as it came from the mold . Astonishing as It may seem , there is but one authentic treatise on paktong in existence , the book by Alfred Bonnin , entitled " Tutenag and Paktong , " published ( in limited edition of 400 copies ) by the Oxford University Press , England . Those who wish further information on the subject of paktong will be pleased to know . that this lucid and well-illustrated volume may be found in the New York Public Library , Fifth Avenue and Forty-sprung-1 Strppf SAMUEL ' CHESTER REID PARIS HURST .

A HALL FOR HORTICULTURE To the Editor of The New York Times : It was with much interest and pleasure that I read Dr. Gager 's remarks recently on the progress of horticulture In European countries as compared with the United States . That this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but this is undoubtedly due to the great number of years that the old countries have vied with each other in their endeavors to produce the finest parks and gardens , both public and private , and also the interest that private individuals have always taken in their gardens , both large and small . In my European travels I have often been astonished at the wonderful displays seen in many of the smaller gardens , both in flowers and ' vegetables , the cooler climate being helpful to them , permitting plant and vegetable life to mature naturally to a state of perfection . There is a great good-natured rivalry over there among the exhibiting amateurs , particularly in England , my home country , and as a consequence every small town has its horticultural society . Many years back the Royal Horticultural Society of England decided to have a home of its own and took over the Drill Hall at Westminster , but the inadequacy of its size was soon apparent , and it was newly constructed into what is now known as the Royal Horticultural Hall and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twenty-two s ears I have been resident in New York it has always been my contention that this great city , or perhaps one or other of the many horticultural organizations , or combination of same , could easily afford to erect a building as suggested by Dr. Gager . From a financial standpoint alone it would undoubtedly prove good business , as well-organized flower shows have demonstrated themselves to be a great attraction and draw multitudes from all parts of the metropolis and further afield . Then . too , the interior of the building should be without pillars and so give more floor space , affording a better display of exhibits , and could be rented also for ** &c.,; and would maintain itself with handsome profits in a few years . ERNEST P. PRINCE . Brooklyn , N. Y. , Sept. 28 , 1930 . POETRY . To the Editor of The New York Times . The discussion in THE Times proves that all interest in poetry is not dead . But how many really know the meaning of " poetry " ? No dictionary adequately describes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meter and rhyme , but the expression of a beautiful , profound and inspiring thought in flowery words . A poet must understand human nature to appeal to his reader , whether he writes of comedy , tragedy , illusion or delusion or of real facts . He must be able to hold the interest of his reader unto the end . Poetry Is harmony , and the real poet will refrain from uttering a discordant note . That note may be the lack of continuity of thought , incongruity or the irregularity of rhyme or rhythm , " poetic license " too often held as an excuse . The poet speaks the " language of the gods , " gently , softly , sweetly , harmoniously . M. SIMON . Atlantic City , N. J. , Sept. 16 , 1930 . CAN UNBELIEVERS BE BELIEVED ? Many Could Be Disqualified as Witnesses Because of Religious Views To the Editor of The New York Times : The new decision of the Supreme Court of North Carolina in the Gastonia textile mill murder case , and the less recent decision by Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving testimoney , make the following excerpt based on my article in the Yale Law Journal entitled " Denial of Equal Rights to Religious Minorities and Non-Believers in the United States " pertinent and interesting : The world has been so long habituated to giving credence to affidavits founded on religious beliefs that expressing by such an oath belief in a Supreme Being ( not necessarily Christ ) who will hold you to account either in this world or in the world to come for false swearing seems even today to the largest numbers of conservative men to be an unfalle ing and reliable means of taking an obligation to tell the truth . This is the common law except where changed by statute . Yet it needs no argument to prove that it is not the exclusive of the sole reliable test , no more than that virtue rests only in the bosom of religionists , true or false . As in all time and climes , religion continues to be a cloak , and that too in relation to affidavits . Credibility and Religion . Is a man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious organization or belief in its tenets ? There will be , of course , the widest range of opinion . Were Thomas Paine , the atheist , and Thomas Jefferson , the disbelieving theist , patriots of the Revolution , less worthy of esteem and credibility , ' than their believing religious contemporaries ? The world highly esteemed Robert G. Ingersoll , the American agnostic ; likewise Darwin , Huxley and the evolutionists , their thousands of followers of yesterday and today . These , together with many other skeptics , were well worthy of belief , . either on their word or on . their affidavits or promises solemnly to tell the truth . Yet none of them could , in conscience , nor would , take an oath on the Gospels or with reference to God . If cnadenged as to belief in a Supreme Being , they would not qualify , and upon the test of belief in a suture state of reward and punishments in this world or elsewhere under His dispensation they would fail . There are many highclass lawyers of the type of Clarence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; likewise many good . churchmen who call themselves Modernists . The State is interested in the truthtelling of witnesses , not in their religious beliefs , warning them ail the while of the penalties of false swearing . It does everything to make the obligation to tell the wnole truth solemn and impressive , binding on the conscience of the affiant , with . the caution that perjury will be met by punishment as an offense against the peace , order and dignity of the State , and not against a Supreme Being . The fervor of the Colonists ' religious devotion was reflected in the ancient common law view that non-conformists and non-believers in the God of the established Church were non dignus fide , unworthy of belief because perpetui inimici , eternal enemies . Scruples Are Recognized . It was a later development , not yet reached in all States , that there are non-believers , even atheists , whose word can be believed , even in the court room ; who have " conscientious " scruples about truth-telling , who feel that the criminal laws against perjury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious belief ; that any obligation , howsoever administered , binds their conscience and that they stand in fear of the State 's punishment for perjury . In order to accommodate the Universalists , the belief as to punishments in a future world was abandoned in favor of belief in punishment inflicted by God in this life . Since the eighteenth century case of an English court entitled . Omychund v. Barker reversed the miszhievous dictum of Lord Coke consigning unbelievers , even as witnesses , to eternal damnation , there : has grown up in England and America a body of public opinion , reflected in legal decisions , that the oaths of such men deserve the fullest respect . That no person is " incapacitated from being . a - witness on account of his religious belief " ( overruling Chancellor Kent of New York ) and that any form of oath suffices which actually binds the particular witnesses ' conscience , even if it varies from the orthodox form . But the Church has not relaxed its hold . In 1870 a constitutional amendment was passed by the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General , Robert G. Ingersoll , because by a Supreme Court decision disbelievers in a Supreme Being were disqualified as witnesses . Maryland , by the Bill of Rights ( 1867 ) , goes to extreme limits in requiring as the qualification both of witnesses and jurors belief both . in " the existence of God and that under His dispensation such person will be held morally accountable for his acts and be rewarded or punished therefor in this world or in the world to come . " This is already used as an excuse to evade jury duty . Worthy Witnesses Disqualified . Wills have been thrown out because attesting witnesses were shown to be disqualified as non-believers under State law , and the same is likely to follow with other important legal documents . Even under Federal practice it is still a moot question whether a non-believer in a State such as referred to above may apply for a patent , trademark or copyright , a passport or the like ; and it has been said such a one may not even be allowed to file schedules in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act of Congress renders the testimony of such a witness incompetent in a Federal jurisdiction . It is certain that many others than avowed infidels would on cross-examination fail to qualify under such requirements as are set forth in the law of Maryland , and to a like entent the law of North Carolina and . New Jersey , with quite a number o. : States following the same method of disqualifying worthy witnesses . B. H. HARTOGENSIS . Baltimore , Md. , Aug. 28 , 1930.
