In 1870 Congress was beginning to hand out Civil War pensions . It gave one to the widow of the Civil War President . Mary Todd Lincoln 's $3,000* a year was the first pension for a Presidential widow . Since then pensions have been granted to nine other Presidential widows-Julia Gardiner Tyler , Sarah Childress Polk , Julia Dent Grant , Lucretia Rudolph Garfield , Ida Saxton McKinley , Edith Carow Roosevelt , Helen Herron Taft , Edith Boiling , Galt Wilson , Grace Goodhue Coolidge . Last week this polite beneficence was impolitely questioned for the first time . <P> Ohio-born Mary Scott Lord Dimmick had been widowed by Lawyer Walter Erskine Dimmick when she married Benjamin Harrison-in 1896 , four years after he left the White House , five years before he died . Last week the Senate Pensions Committee favorably reported a bill grant Mrs. Harrison , now nearing 80 , a $5,000 annuity such as other Presidential widows have received , but Massachusetts David Ignatius Walsh found it his unpleasant duty " to file a formal protest . Pointing out that Mrs. Harrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harrison " and that both her husbands left her trust funds , Senator Walsh objected : " At a time when millions of our citizens are destitute .. . what justification can be advanced to vote a pension out of the public treasury to one who has ample private means and no vestige of claim for such a public bounty except the slender circumstance that tor a brief period she was married to a man who had once been President ? " <P> Although the possibility that anything could stop the Harrison pension remained slim indeed , Mrs. Harrison 's friends sprang indignantly to her defense . Ihey denied that she had sought the pension herself , recalled that the resolution had first been introduced by New York 's late Representative Theodore A. Peyser at the suggestion of " friends , " had passed the House unanimously . Most agreed that Mrs. Harrison could use it . All agreed that she deserved it , for sundry reasons . Among them : 1 ) she had lived in the White House two years nursing her ailing Aunt Lavinia , the first Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a the expense of attending various functions , notably the Republican National Convention of 1936 ; 3 ) the Government pensions the widows of war veterans who married long after their period of service . In Manhattan where she lives in a small swank Fifth Avenue apartment with one maid , Mary Lord Harrison said nothing whatever .
