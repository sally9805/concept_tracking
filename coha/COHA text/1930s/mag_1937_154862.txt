In the year ending June 1937 , U. S. exports to Mexico totaled $94,000,000 as against $68,000,000 for the previous twelve months . This made the second biggest U. S. neighbor the sixth best U. S. customer . Last week this healthy trade was endangered by a new form of taxation devised by Mexico . <P> Unable to collect income taxes on the Mexican income of many U. S. firms which do business by direct mail or by traveling representatives ( firms which maintain no offices in Mexico ) , the Mexican Government issued an order to its consuls all over the world : in addition to the previous 5% customs prepayment , let consuls collect a 3% income-tax prepayment , on the invoice value of every shipment granted a visa . <P> To Montgomery Ward , U. S. Steel , Du Pont , Sherwin-Williams and International General Electric , and other firms with Mexican customers , the new tax was a new headache . It fails to make any allowance for the fact that some transactions result in losses . It seriously affects contracts already made with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will also result in double taxation for any concern which maintains an office in Mexico , since such offices already pay income taxes . According to the new decree , these offices will be entitled to a rebate , but U. S. exporters sniffed that the chance of getting money back from Mexico was like the chance of getting it back from the grave or the U. S. Treasury . <P> In Mexico City U. S. Ambassador Josephus Daniels , having complained to the Mexican Government , was informed that the tax could not be suspended or revoked except by the improbable consent of the Mexican Congress . But while exporters grumbled and protested , it was already apparent that Mexico like other governments which try to plug income tax loopholes was not going to be 100% successful . Foreign sellers promptly treated the tax like an import duty , added 3% to their invoice prices , thus passed the bulk of the new tax to the down-trodden Mexican who will eventually buy their products .                @ @ @ @ @
