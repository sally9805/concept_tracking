Febrile , high-powered , insouciant is Reno , Nevada , divorce capital of the U.S. With rare abandon it orders its life , welcoming all comers : moody socialites , glittering cinemactresses , minor celebrities who will bring front-page space as did Cartoonist Peter Arno and Author Cornelius Vanderbilt Jr . when they quarreled boyishly ( TIME , June 29 ) . Loving to be unique , Reno was pleased last week when there arrived in town Dr. Thomas Kiley Gorman , 38 , first Roman Catholic Bishop of the new diocese of Reno , Nevada ( TIME , Aug. 3 ) . For Bishop Gorman is no run-of-the-mill prelate such as another State might get : he is a golfer , joke-teller , smoker of big black cigars , and the youngest Catholic Bishop in the U.S. <P> Consecrated five weeks ago in Los Angeles , Bishop Gorman arrived last week in Reno bringing with him his own publicity man , Fred V. Williams . Day after his arrival he was formally installed in old brick St. Thomas Aquinas Church , which is now elevated to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From its porch he could look across the street to El Cortez Hotel , where lives many a divorce-seeker . Five blocks away is " Gamblers ' Row " - Douglas Alley and Center St. Eight blocks away is the Reno Court House , where Monday " wash-days " are held . <P> After his installation Bishop Gorman banqueted with priests and assisting bishops . ( In his diocese of some 10,000 souls are 33 churches , 14 priests , one parochial school , one Catholic hospital . ) At the State Building next evening he was given a public banquet . Said he : " It is already becoming embarrassing to be pointed out ' as Reno 's ' boy bishop , ' Parents have always warned their children that they should be seen but not heard . " He busied himself meeting and talking with his welcomers . Among them were Nevada 's Governor Fredrick Bennett Balzar , California 's Governor James ( " Sunny Jim " ) Rolph Jr. , Reno 's Mayor Edward Ewing Roberts , Justice Edward Ducker of the Nevada Supreme Court , onetime District Attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reluctant to discuss moral questions in his new home than he had been in California , Bishop Gorman commented , after a tour of the town : " Before we can save the world , we must save ourselves . No crusades are intended . " <P> To the United Press he issued a signed article : " Naturally my position on divorce is that of the Catholic Church . Marriage is a permanent relation of lifelong duration , and separation for grave cause may be permitted , but without freedom to remarry . As a question of principle , the problem of divorce in Nevada is no different for the Bishop of Reno than for any 1 other Catholic Bishop . Nevada is n't unique . . . . What does make Nevada the divorce mecca is the absolute freedom for immediate remarriage . . . . Only one more step remains to reach a state of promiscuity prevailing in the barnyard or jungle . . . . <P> " Gambling , in a strict sense of the word -I do not mean the laying of small wagers for fun-is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly as other vices . Communities and families where the gambling fever obtains can not long continue sound either economically or socially . "
