By the terms of the Social Security Bill , enacted in August 1935 , most payrolls in the U. S. are taxed 2%-1% paid by the employer , 1% by the employe-to pay for pensions for workers over 65 . This enormous levy was bitterly debated in Congress before it was passed , has been bitterly debated by U. S. economists , political pundits and taxpayers ever since . Last week , two incidents caused the debate to wax more bitter than ever . One was the case of a Washington secretary named Mabel Shea . The other was a proposal to use Social Security old-age reserve funds , which will this year amount to about $400,000,000 , to help promote a housing boom financed principally by private capital . <P> Mabel Shea works for Washington Columnist Mark Sullivan ( Our Times ) , who pays her $35 a week . Last month , Columnist Sullivan used the case of his secretary to illustrate two stanchly conservative theories : 1 ) that by deducting 1% of her salary for an old-age pension the Government was unjustifiably meddling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her money , and 2 ) that , even more deplorably , the Government 's handling of the money which it forced him to deduct from her salary was highly unbusinesslike , if not downright dishonest . The law , said Columnist Sullivan , had promised that all such collections would be saved up for use in paying the pensions . Instead , the Treasury was using the money to pay current expenses in a fashion which would cause a private citizen who followed the same procedure to " go to jail quickly and for a long time . " <P> What actually happens is that the Treasury sells its own bonds to the Social Security old-age reserve fund . The fund pays for the bonds with Social Security taxes , which the Treasury then uses for general Government expenses . In effect , instead of selling bonds to the public to pay the deficit , the Treasury sells bonds to itself . <P> Three days after Mark Sullivan had introduced the subject of his secretary , Columnist Walter Lippmann , whose articles appear on the same page of the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear up some of Columnist Sullivan 's confusion by elucidating the theory of Social Security finance . He reached the conclusion that , while the Government was acting according to law , the law itself was at fault . Last week , the subject of Mark Sullivan 's secretary came up again when her employer wrote a column saying that , despite Columnist Lippmann 's reasoning , he was " still mystified " by what the Government was doing with its share of Mabel Shea 's salary . Same day the subject of Mabel Shea jumped from the pages of the Herald Tribune into Franklin Delano Roosevelt 's White House office . Grey-haired James L. Wright of the Buffalo News asked the President if he had been reading about Mr. Sullivan 's secretary . While the President chuckled , Reporter Wright explained that " Walter Lippmann says that you have been taking the 35 a week that Mark Sullivan sends you . . . and spending it on riotous living . " <P> Asked Mr. Roosevelt : Is Mark here ? " <P> " Yes , " drawled Columnist Sullivan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
