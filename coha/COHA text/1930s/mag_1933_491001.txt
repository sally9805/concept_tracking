I recalled my tranquil graystone house built when Pennsylvania was a virgin forest inhabited by Lennil.enape Indians and Philadelphia was a little , staid settlement of brick and flowering trees on the Delaware River , the property of Mr. Penn . I thought of General Washington , dark and immutable in the winter of Valley Forge , and of the Northwest Territory . I thought of New Orleans , French , then Spanish and French again , and of Andrew Jackson , who wore until the end of his life a miniature of his wife on a ribbon . I thought of Texas and the plains , mountains of silver , and copper mountains , Butte and Leadville and the Santa F6 Trail . Furs floating down the Missouri River in canoes to St. Louis . I thought of the Civil War : Jeb Stuart wound in his yellow sash and Forrest with his immense saber , I thought . of amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and men . Puritan theocracy and evangelical circuit riders in the wilderness . I thought of Richard Byrd and Grover Cleveland , Walter Reed , George Rogers Clark , Alexander Hamilton , Alfred Emanuel Smith and the elder Morgan . The images , the incredible accomplishments , of a hundred rnen swept through my mind ; men made by and making America . I thought of national virtues and faults , appalling ignorance and perfect understanding , sentimental flaws and credulity , and a serenity of character hard and ringing like metal . But , more than all the rest , I thought of the loveliness of the American land : The banks dark with violets after winter in Chester County ; the moss-hung oaks of the Bonaventure Cemetery in Savannah ; the high mesa of New Mexico ; the immemorial , murmurous trees by the Klamath River ; the Battery and gardens of Charleston ; immaculate Mennonite farms in Eastern Pennsylvania ; the mountain streams at dusk , the swift , vermilion-marked trout of Virginia .

Too obvious and too often referred to . It was impossible , I found , to construct a satisfactory existence on the presence of the Mediterranean Sea and crepes Suzette . I went to a succession of villas , to casinos , with an increasing sense of futility ; I listened to the Franco-British version of American speech , the always delicate and asthetic conversation , with a rapidly growing weariness . I continued to gaze with surprise at men dressed in all the hues of brilliant parrots . I speculated seriously about severe girls indifferent to both life and men . The conviction seized me that , like the United States , in Cannes I was a little crude , not wholly civilized . I could not , with success , wear a beret , and it . seemed to me that espadrilles were damned uncomfortable . Retreat From the Riviera I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , to me , the Riviera seemed to be a place where men grew weak and women strong . I added  --  fortunately , in silence  --  that the Riviera was a pink sewer . A perfumed drain attached , for their better sanitation , to the countries of Britain and the United States , and emptying into the Mediterranean Sea . There was , now , no decent , thoughtless pleasure in the worlds , the islands , of Europe and North America . The times were hard and demanded hard , unsesthetic , measures and men ; women with the simplicity , the honesty , of deep feeling . Women , in short , who were primarily women ; and with an immense sense of relief I left the Riviera  --  in a red-lacquered compartment  --  for more serious considerations and cities . I watched  --  it was evening  --  the promontories gilded with lights , the illuminated casinos and villas , the dark , calm sea , retreat into a region of the past . that I would never , it was probable , see again ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indifferent to an immense national present , a problematic and not entirely safe racial future . They were not , however , in that apparent freedom of mind , enviable ; for , I recognized , their minds were not free . Memory troubled them . The loneliness of aliens oppressed t heir hearts . In the morning I reached Paris and moved rapidly toward the Ritz Betel . I realized once more the fact that , beyond all doubt , Paris was the most beautiful city in the world . The autumn foliage everywhere was brown ; the houses , in an early sunlight , were more silver than gray ; the parks and fountains , the monuments , succeeded each other in a lovely pattern of green sod , water in cascades , and marble . The inimitable perfection of an urban and witty spirit was everywhere visible . My taxicab turned into the Place Vendome and stopped before the inconspicuous entrance to the Hotel Ritz . My room , however , was by the Rue Cambon , above a formal garden ; and , pleased to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked forward to the enjoyment of Paris . It was so totally different from the Riviera . I dwelt on the celebrated gayety of Paris , the famous restaurants and caf  --  s , late suppers and champagne and the French girls . Devotees of Terpsichore and Mammon I WOULD , I decided , taking advantage of so much , live while I was in Paris in a lightness of spirit impossible to the Riviera ; and , consequently , I went to Maxim 's for dinner . It had been twenty-five years since I dined at Maxim 's , and it was largely rearranged , newly decorated , the maitre d'hetel pointed out . That , however , I silently thought , had not been an improvement . Dinner , though , was excellent  --  a clear soup and fowl , a green vegetable , cheese and coffee ; a half bottle of claret and a glass of Vieille Cure . Two remarkably pretty girls were seated opposite me and , the serious question of food settled , I made it possible for them to move to my table for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , engagingly . polite ; they scarcely referred to the fact that their dinners were unpaid for . I assumed that obligation at once  --  a very reasonable sum  --  and the girl with dark hair inquired if I cared to dance . I danced with her ; I danced with the girl whose hair was light ; and then , when it became evident that I was at the point of leaving Maxim 's , a vigorous argument  --  an altercation really  --  at . once began . It rose from a cause both simple and profound  --  how much the girls would charge me for the privilege of paying for their dinners . The one with light hair declared they should each have two hundred and fifty francs . The other . skeptical of getting what she admitted was their due , thought a hundred francs might be sufficient . The blond girl reminded her indignantly that both of them  --  both  --  had danced with me . Four hundred francs was the least they could accept .

In a former letter , you will remember , we requested you to call on our dealer in Tylerville , Mr. A. H.

I inquired at the local chamber of commerce and elsewhere , and found that Mr. Yerkes is the only man in town who is in a position to take over and successfully carry on the dealership which Mr. Smith is giving up . Before offering Mr. Yerkes the job , however , I decided I would have a look at this Smith guy . I had met him once several years ago , and I remembered him as one of our most successful dealers . " Perhaps , " I said to myself , " old man Henderson 's idea that we ought to drop him in the garbage can this way is just as cockeyed as some of his former ideas . " So I went around and called on Mr. Smith . I asked him what was the matter . And I am very glad that I did . The poor fish has certainly been having rotten luck . His business is completely bankrupt , and he himself seems on the verge of a nervous breakdown . Honestly , Henderson , his story was pitiful . The way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tears .

If he borrows the money , he will have to pay it hack sometime , and it does n't look to me as if he ever could . But difficulties such as these never discourage Alexander Botts . I am leaving this afternoon for Chicago . where I will attempt to negotiate the necessary loan . If I fail , which is more than likely , the Earthworm Tractor Company will have to advance the fifty thousand dollars . Otherwise we ca n't keep Mr. Smith as our dealer .

D EAR BOTTS : Your letter is received , and I am not in any way delighted to know about " this generous piece of rescue work . " I do n't wish to seem harsh or unfeeling . And I deeply regret the fact that Mr. Smith 's business has failed . But you must realize that the Earthworm Tractor Company can not pay your salary and expenses while you rush about the country attempting to negotiate a large unsecured loan for a completely bankrupt gentleman who has already notified us that he has severed his business connection with us . Your suggestion that the Earthworm Company might lend Mr. Smith fifty thousand dollars is absurd . This company is a business concern , not a philanthropic organization . You will return to Tylerville at once , and follow out my instructions regarding the investigation of Mr. John Yerkes . Very truly yours , GILBERT HENDERSON , Sales Manager . ALEXANDER BOTTS ' SALES PROMOTION REPRESENTATIVE EARTHWORM TRACTOR COMPANY BLACKSTONE HOTEL , CHICAGO . ILLINOIS . Saturday , February 6 , 1932 . MR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , EARTHWORM CITY , ILLINOIS . EAR HENDERSON : Your letter of yesterday D is here , and there is one thing about it that pleases me very much . When I wrote you that l thought you would be " delighted to know about this generous piece of rescue work , " I had , all the time , a sort of a hunch that perhaps you would not be delighted at all . Your letter proves , in a very pleasing way , that I was right . It confirms an opinion I have had for a long time  --  to the effect that practically all my hunches are correct . And it encourages me to go ahead and act upon a very distinct hunch which has recently entered my mind . This new hunch is a sort of vague feeling that in business , as well as elsewhere , we always get along better if we act in a large , generous and open-hearted way  --  looking always at the idealistic , inspirational and humanistic aspects of a problem , and refusing to stultify ourselves by a narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it . is obvious that I will have to follow out my original plan in this Smith matter , in spite of your orders to the contrary . But do not get the idea . that I am blaming you in any way for giving me these orders . In fact , I will admit that the fault. , if any , is entirely mine . My letter to you from Tylerville had to be cut short so that I could catch the train for Chicago . I did not have time to give you the details of my interview with Mr. Smith . Consequently , when you wrote me , you did not know the facts of the case . And it was perfectly natural for you to write without any real comprehension of what you were saying . At present , fortunately , I have plenty of time . The banker whom I came to see has gone out into the suburbs somewhere for the week-end , so it will be necessary for me to remain here until he gets back on Monday or Tuesday . This will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the hotel is very comfortable , not to say luxurious . And , as I loll about comfortably on the elegant upholstery of a large armchair , I will give you an account of my visit to poor old Mr. Smith , and explain exactly why I am right in this matter and why you are wrong . Mr. Smith 's business offices had , as you know , burned down . So I called on him at his home  --  a handsome brick house amid pleasant surroundings in the outskirts of Tylerville . The room in which he received me was elegantly furnished and pleasing to the eye , but Mr. Smith himself was indeed a pitiable spectacle . I had remembered him , from my brief acquaintance of years ago , as a most admirable person with handsome features and a commanding presence . But all this was now changed . Before me I saw a weak and trembling creature , with a furtive expression , a nervous shiftiness of eye , and a general hangdog air of discouragement . and defeat . If you had been there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him as I did . And your warm heart would have at once prompted you to do everything you could to help him . As soon as I had introduced myself , Mr. Smith began a long and tedious discussion of his troubles . And out of his rambling remarks I was able to piece together the salient facts of the case  --  which are , briefly , as follows : Mr. Smith 's business is carried on through the Smith Tractor Company , a corporation in which he owns practically all the stock . The company 's main asset is  --  or rather was  --  a handsome building which cost three hundred thousand dollars , and which housed the tractor salesrooms and offices . The building was mortgaged to the local building-and-loan association ; the final payment of fifty thousand dollars being due next week . Besides this , the local national bank held the company 's note for ten thousand  --  also due next week . Mr. Smith did not have the sixty thousand to make these payments  --  the tractor business has been a bit slow lately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or borrow the money somewhere , as the building was worth so much more than the loans , and was well insured . And then , without warning , Mr. Smith was visited by a series of astounding misfortunes . His bookkeeper , whom he loved and trusted like his own son , fell in love with a girl who worked as assistant cashier at the building-and-loan office . They got so warm and confused about each other that they both forgot all about business . The bookkeeper forgot to mail the check that Mr. Smith gave him for the fire insurance , and his head was so full of poetry that he paid DO attention to the notices that came in from the insurance company . The building-and-loan association never uttered a peep , because it was the job of the assistant cashier to check the insurance on property on which they held mortgages ; and the assistant cashier , poor girl , was so busy thinking about moonlight and roses that she , naturally , could n't keep her mind on her work . All of which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles of biology , but it was certainly tough on poor old Mr. Smith . Well , the happy , though demented , pair got married a week ago Wednesday and left for Kansas City , where the bridegroom had found himself a new and better job . So that was all right for them . But the next day  --  Thursday  --  Mr. Smith 's building burned down . And on Friday he was hit in the face with the news that there was no insurance , and that his company was in the hole with debts of sixty thousand , and assets , including the building lot and a few things sated from the fire. , of about ten thousand . This regrettable situation was in no way the fault of Mr. Smith . It would be unfair to claim that he should have realized the state his bookkeeper was in , and checked up on him more closely . No mere tractor man can be expected to grasp all the psychological and fiscal implications of a love affair between a bookkeeper and an assistant cashier . The disaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that the three Fates , or possibly a couple of other sinister goddesses of misfortune , sneaked up on Mr. Smith when he was not looking , and just naturally gnawed the seat right out of his pants . And even this was not all . When the poor man realized his condition , he began rushing around to the banks , hoping to get an extension on his loans , or else to borrow enough to meet his payments . But everybody sized him up as busted beyond hope , and nobody would give him any accommodation at all . None of his friends would help him . And this final misfortune just tore the remains of his pants right off , removing in addition all that was left of his courage and morale . At the time I visited him , he could see nothing but the dark side of things . " I am ruined , " he said . " And , what is worse , I am disgraced . I am no better than a common thief .

Name Street City crate This offer not good in Canada ( Coneinded from Page 56 ) time when , individuals of the highest principles and learning asserted , it was necessary to discard nil national barriers in the civilized world and unite for a common good ; when arms should be reduced to a vanishing point , I had an increasing desire to see the United States as solidly national , as selfish , as possible ; I wondered by what strange reasoning disarmament had come to be identified with peace .

No indication existed of their candid willingness to disarm . No great steel works , it was recognized , could exist without the making of arms , the eventuality of war . This was true in Germany and France , England and in the United States . I was able to find no evidence that , for the cause of peace , great mills were being dismantled . There were no public protests in the countless formal discussions of peace against a secretive advertisement and provisional sale of arms . There were sincere men , even statesmen , who passionately demanded the exposure and end of all such practice ; but they formed a minority ; they were not , finally , in power . I could not find the slightest cessation of historic European national animosities and fears : France dreaded Germany and the future ; Germany was both politic , in its heavy , self-absorbed manner , and significantly , patiently , silent ; England , apparently occupied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands of the most capable bankers , the shrewdest nationalistic profiteers , that existed . Italy was saturated by a renewed sense of power , a resentful pride of importance . None showed a spirit . of international good will ; not one , it seemed , had been moved , impressed , by the economic and human waste , the destruction , of war . The United States , however , was different  --  a large part . of America was filled with a large , a generous , idealism . We wanted to bring peace , an American prosperity , to everyone . We could , we were certain , cure all the ills of the world by the principles , the optimism , that had not exactly succeeded in the United States . The Traditional American Desire The traditional American desire to be loved , to be appreciated and applauded , by the entire universe had again , in a desperate and secretive modern world , made us ridiculous . The underlying cause for this , accurately measured , was depressing ; it did not come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfortunately , the reverse was true  --  we were not growing stronger , increasingly superior , but weaker . The wrong sense of values , an admiration for mean things , an indifference not only to national but local government , the habits of hypocrisy and empty boasting , had nll operated to undermine our character and weaken our position in the world . The rich acknowledged to no responsibilities , and the poor , inured to the injustice of a general political and commercial dishonesty , had grown satirically indifferent to the benefits , the threatened progression , of a land it was difficult for them to enjoy . No country , I reflected , lying awake in the train carrying me to Bremerhaven and the United States , could exist without the confidence , the admiration and support , of a majority of its citizens ; the French dearly loved France ; the Germans  --  mostly  --  stood firmly on the soil of their Fatherland ; the English continued without a regret to give their lives for England ; only in the United States were there men of influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vague , an impracticable , international Utopia . Even Russia was more solid than that . I was thinking , specifically , about the war debts , recalling the natural , the inevitable , efforts of the European nations to escape a most difficult payment . I could see why France , with the probable loss of German resources , should make every effort to evade the responsibility of a debt contracted in desperation ; I understood why England tried with the greatest skill to put off , or perhaps stop , the further draining of her already seriously diminished riches ; and Germany , for the present , I was willing to believe , had little or no money ; only the United States confounded me . A growing willingness , in the most unexpected and instructed quarters , to cancel the European debts left me in a state of discouraged surprise . An act of idiotic unselfishness that , together with all the other considerations , we simply could not afford . I had a clear vision of what , if the situation had been reversed , the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done . I could almost hear the relieved and acidly humorous comments of Europe if its indebtedness to America was canceled . The Only Road to Peace Gold and its fullest equivalent in political weight and commercial economic advantages , I said aloud in the cold German dawn . The only America that could hope to survive the present calamities and threats was a strong and self-confident America ; an America that neither expected nor dealt in favors . The United States would have to reconcile itself to the fact that , rather than admired , it was , more than not  --  and for a sufficiency of reasons  --  universally disliked . It was potentially powerful . If the barrier of nations came to be discarded for an international common interest with , for example , the United States and the British Empire , it would not occur through a cancellation of obligations , but for the reason that America was so strong , so unified , so well armed in all its departments , that it could not be ignored . Then , it was conceivable , peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied with Europe , actually thinking about the United States . The Europa slowly left its stone pier : a gray mist of rain hung over the German coast ; " Good-by , " I said to the receding shore . " Good-by . " The faint vibration of the ship 's engines filled my cabin , mingled with the audible , forced rush of air through openings above my head . The sea was calm and then piled in great black mountains of water : the Europa was swept . with ponderous waves and a storming , frigid spray . The sea , again , was calm ; coming back to a countryside that , I believed , was more beautiful than any other , austere in early winter , I was filled with a renewed sense of realities , a profound gratitude and affection .

On more than one occasion , when he was smaller , she had related to him , with gestures , the tale of Blanquita . It was , in fact , a simplified version of this same story which Antonio had begun in his letter to the American boy scout . Antonio sat up straight to make himself as tall as possible . Then in the simple , direct style favored by all masters of the word , he bought the lucky lottery ticket , discovered Blanquita , and decided to give her a career .

Blanquita had no more than begun her musical education before she was observed by Diego Montez , who , in spite of the police on his trail , paid her insistent and unwelcome attentions . The matter climaxed when , by a bold maneuver , the bandit kidnaped Blattquita and carried her to the deserted hut , closely pursued by Antonio on his brother 's bicycle . " Two more coffees.

With a superhuman strength I wedged through . - What a sight was mine when I found myself in that place of horror , senor ! " " I 'll say , " commented Mr. Buvelly in the language of Shakspere .

As for you , I detest you now and forever . ' It was this speech , senor , that roused the devil in him . Pulling the automatic from his pocket , he aimed deliberately at me and fired .

The bandit had gone , leaving behind him a bloody trail , evidently the effect of my resist2LTICO . II is automatic was on the floor . " " Two more coffees , " said Mr. Buvelly . " We were taken to Blanquita 's home . There , owing to my insistence , we were married . I know nothing of this , senor . I can only repeat what was told me with the evidence of the marriage certificate . All this time I lived and acted without the slightest consciousness of what I was doing . Then one day , a month after my rescue of Blanquita , it seems I dropped down motionless , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the story had far outrun the simple legend which it had been Antonio 's purpose to relate . It had soared from the miasmatic atmosphere of diplomacy to that purer altitude of art for art 's sake . " It was along- , tedious illness , during-which I lay in a stupor . When I became conscious I perceived I was once more in the home of my parents and about my bedside were the loving faces of my mother and father and my brothers and sisters . I called for Blanquita . She did not come . Desperately I sprang from the sheets , dressed myself and hurried to the humble dwelling that she occupied with her mother , only to find it deserted . They were both gone . They had disappeared during my illness . No one knew where . " Tears stood in Antonio 's eyes . " Since then , senor , my life has been a torment . As far as my means permitted I have searched for her constantly . You are a man of experience , senor ; what shall I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then responded in the language of Shakspere . " You ought . to smoke up , " he said . " Your pipe has gone out . Two more coffees . " Antonio realized the insult , together with his failure . Mastering his emotions , he controlled his facial muscles . " It is a problem , senor . " " It 's worse than that , " agreed Mr. Buvelly . It occurred to Antonio that . at least he might shoot a parting arrow and leave the barb rankling in Mr. Buvelly 's hide . " The Senor Vice Consul , " he said slowly , rolling the words over on his tongue , " is giving a dinner party tonight at seven in honor of his birthday . He is inviting some of the Americans iu Puerto Largo . " A diplomat who indulges in private malice is no longer a diplomat . Immediately Antonio was aware of his fatal error , With a- wholly unexpected vivacity , Mr. Buvelly had risen from the table . " Seven o'clock , ' he said in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consul , my boy , I 'll be there at seven sharp . 1 wo n't forget . " And talking down Antonio 's gasped explanations that no one had been invited but Nora and her mother , he hurried off without even offering to pay the score . " Toodamfresh ! " Antonio commented bitterly as be fished the pesetas from his pocket , paid the waiter , and tried to forget his outraged stomach . For moment he racked his brains for some fresh method of showing up Buvelly , thereby reconciling the young sweethearts and reinstating himself with the Senor Vice Consul . Then , suddenly and gloriously , the idea came . IV IT WAS half-past six in the evening . With a word of polite greeting to Julio , the chauffeur , Antonio deftly slipped into the consulate by the back door . Caramela turned from her conversation with the cook to greet him . " And here is the Senor Vice Consul 's little monkey , " she observed . Antonio swallowed the insult , happy enough to discover that as yet the household was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pocket , he explained his presence in the kitchen with rapid mendacity : " These American cocktails , already mixed at the American Bar of the Hotel Ingle 's , I have procured at the suggestion of the Senor Vice Consul for Senor Buvelly . And do not forget to tell Senor Buvelly where the cocktails are ; as the Senor Vice Consul himself , for diplomatic reasons , must appear to know nothing about it . " Disregarding the perfunctory objections of Caramela , Antonio now calmly took off his coat , and after proper precautions to avoid observation by the vice consul , proceeded to aid in the setting of the table . The three places arranged for Nora , her mother and the vice consul he increased to four and , always concealing his anguish in masterly fashion , he dodged his late employer and awaited the arrival of Mr. Buvelly . At exactly seven the American came , in company with Nora and her mother . From behind a door Antonio observed Mr. Buvelly , in his sweepingly polite way , thank the vice consul for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come through A ntonio . With a suavity of which Antonio had not . believed the vice consul capable , the latter shook the hand of his guest and bade him welcome . It was only after Mr. Buvelly had been seated in the reception room , together with Nora and her mother , that Antonio overheard the vice consul expressing himself in a low monologue . The subject of the monologue was Antonio ; and Antonio knew enough of the language of Shakspere to realize what the vice consul was saying about him . He gritted his teeth and waited . His idea was simple , being based on the sound principle that , given enough rope , a man will hang himself . There was no doubt that Mr. Buvelly had come to the dinner party already dosed with strong liquor . A proper amount in addition would certainly cause him to do or say something which would show him up in his true colors . Nora would be disgusted and the vice consul , when he learned all , would give back Antonio 's job . Caramela @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice to Mr. Buvellv , who excused himself and followed her to the little nook outside the dining room . A little later when Antonio ventured to peep at the tray , three of the cocktail glasses were empty . He took a long breath while he thrilled with a stimulation almost as pleasant as if he had drunk the stuff himself . " The Senor Vice Consul , " he now explained audaciously to Caramela ,
