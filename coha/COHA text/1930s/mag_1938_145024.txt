Of the 12,000,000 Negroes in the U. S. , about 50,000 play golf-either on public links or on 20-odd private Negro courses . <P> Northern Negroes , settling in large cities , rarely know a brassie from a mashie until they have become prosperous enough to enjoy the game as a pastime . But in the South , where country clubs use Negro caddies in great numbers , many moppets learn the fundamentals of golf along with their ABCs . <P> Last week , on the Palos Park ( public ) golf course just outside Chicago . 135 of the country 's top-notch colored golfers ( including 16 women ) met for the 13th annual Negro championships of the U. S. Thirty-four played for money . 101 for fun . Some carried their own clubs , others paid white caddies $1 a round . All were extremely courteous to the lone white competitor , a local enthusiast named Charles Hlavacek who entered the tournament because he disliked to interrupt his habit of playing daily on the Palos Park course . <P> In the opening round of the Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Robert Patrick ( " Pat " ) Ball , Chicago grocer who had won the title three times . Others with a lively following were dapper John Dendy. defending champion who works as a locker boy at North Carolina 's fashionable Asheville Country Club ; and Hugh Smith , a Thomastown ( Ga. ) office boy who recently shot a 263 in a southern tournament and was forthwith sent to the national meet by his boss ( for whom he caddies weekends ) . <P> After the first round , however , the greater part of the gallery of 300 trudged around after lanky , woolly-topped Howard Wheeler of Atlanta-watched him tee up on the edge of a match folder , shuffle along the fairways in a Stepin Fetchit gait , plop down on the greens while waiting his turn to putt . A onetime professional whose occupation has been " just walkin ' round " since he lost his job at Atlanta 's Lincoln ( Negro ) Country Club in 1933. 29-year-old Howard Wheeler proved last week that he could still teach folks a few golfing tricks . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please many a top-flight white golfer : rounds of 68 , 73 , 72 , 71- on a tough , hilly course he had never seen before . His 284 not only won the tournament and first prize of $200 but set a new record for the Negro championship-just three strokes higher than the all-time U. S. <P> Open record set by famed Ralph Guldahl last year . <P> With this accomplishment , Howard Wheeler took his place alongside Bobby Jones , Charley Yates and others who have made Atlanta a starred spot on the world 's golfing map .
