txt Four armed bandits working apparently on a planned ten-minute schedule robbed the Raritan State Bank here today of between $12,000 and $14,000 , herded two bank employes and six customers into a steel grilled vault , and escaped in a stolen car by crossing near-by railroad tracks a split second before a passing train blocked a police car hot in pursuit . The bandits deliberately passed up another $50,000 in cash when they decided not to tarry for the electrical mechanism of a supervault inside the main one to tick off the fifteen minutes required to open the steel thickness of the bank 's main treasury . They waited only long enough to watch a revolver prodded employe demonstrate the mechanism , then ran for their waiting car carrying waste paper baskets filled with the loot already collected . The imprisoned victims almost immediately released themselves through a self-opening device inside the vault , and telephoned the alarm to the Raritan police station which is almost around the corner . There , Eddie Diesbusky , Superin- tendent of Streets , was sitting while the police force was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police car , and whirled out on the street just as the bandit car zoomed by . Train Halts Pursuer About 150 yards behind them , and gaining every second , he saw the gates on the Central Railroad of New Jersey descending at the Anderson Street crossing some two blocks from the bank . The robbers got across . Diesbusky was blocked . He detoured around the train but by that time the bandits had disappeared and there was not a witness to say in which direction they went . Within a few minutes State police headquarters in Trenton and Morristown had patrols combing both main highways and secondary roads for miles around . A witness to the escape had furnished them with the license number of the car  --  New Jersey LL 886 ? which was quickly established as the registration number of a car stolen yesterday in Trenton . Former United States Senator Joseph S. Frelinghuysen , who is president of the bank , and formerly a resident of Raritan , was not here when the four men entered the twostory brick bank building at Somerset and Anderson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employes of the bank , and the only persons there at the moment were Albert P. Klein , 33 years old , assistant cashier , and Mrs. Alice Barbo , 22 , secretary and bookkeeper . Mr. Klein was at the counter and Mrs. Barbo was at a desk typing . The robbers , two of them wearing dark glasses and all garbed in rough fashion , without coats , walked up to each of the four tellers ' windows and covered them with revolvers , which , the police believe , were of .32 caliber . " This is a stick-up , " they announced . " Put up your hands . " After a quick survey one of the robbers went to the door and took up a station there . Another ordered Klein to lie on the floor behind the counter . A third directed Mrs. Barbo to cover her hands . The men moved around behind the tellers ' windows and began scooping up all the cash in sight and emptying the trays in the drawers under the counter . Klein said later that he tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn his face down . He said there was no mechanism behind the counter by which he could set off an alarm . When all the money at the counters had been collected , one of the men made Klein get up from the floor and lead the way into the vault . This is a grilled affair on the same floor , about ten feet deep and five feet wide . Meanwhile , customers had begun to enter the place and the man at the door was dealing with them in efficient fashion . First to arrive was Dr. Milton Nimaroff , a dentist . He no sooner entered the place than the bandit on guard at the door flourished a revolver at him . " Sit on the floor and keep your hands on the floor , " he ordered . The dentist complied without a word . Then Patrick di Paulo , 16-yearcld son of former Police Chief Nicholas di Paulo , entered the bank clutching two $5 notes . " Give me them , " the bandit said . Young Di Paulo handed over one but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy 's back . Di Paulo protestingly handled over the other $5 and squatted on the floor with the dentist . He was soon joined by another youthful friend . Edward R. Harcharik , also 16 , sauntered through the door to pay $60 rent in behalf of his employer , Samuel Kahn . He said that the man at the door told him , " All right , kid , get in the corner too . " " He had his hand in his pocket but I did n't see his revolver , " the youth said later . " But he did n't see my $60 , either . I 've still got it . " Then came Miss Ann Cunningham , secretary and treasurer of a local coal company . She had $65 in cash and some checks for deposit . " I 'll take that , " said the bandit . He pocketed the cash and handed back the checks , then made her sit on the floor too . Other victims who happened to stroll in during the robbery were Peter Moswrick , a depositor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were made to join the others on the floor . Time Lock on Main Vault In the meantime Klein was inside the vault with one of the robbers . This man was interested in the main vault , and was trying to get Klein to open it . The assistant cashier , who admitted later that the revolver made him " awfully nervous , " showed the bandit some $1,200 in silver in another drawer , but explained as convincingly as he could that the main vault opened electrically , and that it took fifteen minutes to open it . " Do n't give me that stuff ; I 'll blow your brains out , " the robber retorted . Klein thereupon gave a demonstration of the lock mechanism . Meanwhile one of the bandits outside called out , " Come on , - hurry up . We 've only got two minutes . " About eight minutes had elapsed . " 0 . K. , we ca n't wait . " the man inside the vault said . He ordered the others inside . Klein was locked behind an inner grill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grilled door that was selfunlocking from the inside . The bandits debated closing the huge steel door . Klein begged them not to . Although this would have cut them off from all possibility of giving an alarm and would have entailed considerable difficulty in rescuing them , the bandits yielded to his entreaties . They left the key to the grilled door which locked him in with the victims outside . Then they bolted . 1 moment later Walter L. Darrell , cashier of the bank , entered . By that time the alarm had been given . A confectioner across the street and a passing truck driver saw the getaway and Yelped spread the alarm . Within twenty minutes hundreds of persons were milling around the scene , Chief of Police Lorenzo Rossi , who was at home eating i lunch , had arrived and taken over the investigation and the State police from Morristown and Trenton already were covering the countryside . The victims of the hold-up reported that there was no hysterian among them . State police said the stolen car used in the robbery belonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trenton . It has not been recovered .

A. ; Goodman handed over the money hag , the leader said , ' Do n't make any noise until we get out of here .
