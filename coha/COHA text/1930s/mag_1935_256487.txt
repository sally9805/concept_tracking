To drag out the month-old story of George V 's Jubilee , nearly every illustrated magazine in England continued to blaze last week with reproductions of the King 's possessions . There were pictures of his horses , racing , hunters and parade , his Clumber hunting spaniels , his late mother 's Labradors , his wife 's collection of old Chinese jade , his Empire stamp collection , his great houses of Sandringham , Buckingham , Balmoral and , 500 years older than the others , Windsor . To the King 's treasures at Windsor , the Connoisseur gave nearly an entire issue. * <P> But all these royal treasures were entirely eclipsed last week by publication of a two-volume work called A Catalogue of the Drawings of Leonardo da Vinci in the Collection of His Majesty the King at Windsor Castle , + by 32-year-old Kenneth McKenzie Clark , Director of London 's National Gallery and Surveyor of the King 's Pictures . The King 's collection is far &; away the biggest and finest collection of Leonardo drawings now known to man . In his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of great Leonardo , one of the brightest , blandest and most mysterious men who ever lived . The second volume is given over to 614 Leonardo drawings . <P> As mysterious as Leonardo is the manner in which most of his surviving drawings turned up in the possession of the : British kings . Leonardo left most of his notes to his pupil Francesco Melzi . All his life he had worked less on particular jobs than on general problems , on the reason for things , on a vast effort to transpose a closely-observed reality into a dream of possible perfection . Could he have found a serviceable fuel , he might have produced an airplane in the 15th Century . All his life he returned again &; again to the study of the flight of birds , the flow of water , the wherefore of wind , the movement of horses , the muscles of men . Of this mass of unfinished work , none of his heirs had the wit and industry to make anything . <P> Melzi 's son sold most of the manuscripts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who in turn sold at least one volume to a Spaniard named Don Juan de Espina . This volume attracted the notice of Thomas Howard , Earl of Arundel , friend to Anthony Van Dyck . For more than ten years the earl 's agents nagged de Espina to sell . When Arundel died in 1646 he owned the book , but by that time Charles I had surrendered to the Scots rebels . Hence , suggests Kenneth Clark , the drawings did not at once pass to the British kings but were , instead , lost to the world for 45 years . <P> In 1690 a dull-witted secretary to William III , one Constantine Huygens , wrote that he had just bought a book of Leonardo 's drawings for 3 guineas . He was too thrifty to give it to his King and he seems to have forgotten the book entirely . More than 70 years later , early in the reign of George III , a Mr. Dalton reached into a chest at Windsor Castle , pulled out the priceless book of Leonardo drawings .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
