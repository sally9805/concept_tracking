Apart from certain tears physically shed in the House of Commons last week , apart from the unprecedented gush of emotion as His Majesty 's Government admitted their Ethiopian policy to be all wrong , apart from other sensational and high strung happenings in London ( see p. 12 ) , there emerged the first clear-cut exposition of what has actually been done behind Europe 's diplomatic scenes to end the Ethiopian war . <P> This exposition was made by Sir Samuel Hoare , 55 , the day after his resignation as British Foreign Secretary and three days before he was succeeded by Mr. Anthony Eden , 38 , the youngest British Foreign Secretary since Earl Granville in 1851 . Its continuing vital importance was well indicated by New-York Timesman Charles A. Selden who cabled from London thus : " Anybody who went to the Commons expecting to hear reproaches and recriminations between Sir Samuel Hoare on the one hand and Mr. Baldwin and other members of the Cabinet on the other was disappointed . There was not a trace of bitterness on either side . The atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lobby after Sir Samuel , Mr. Baldwin and Sir Austen Chamberlain had finished their speeches wondered if the Cabinet break had not been a sham battle or at least an arranged episode to serve some future useful purpose . . . . Another factor that has made many members feel that Sir Samuel 's retirement was not permanent was Sir Austen 's remark in his speech that he hoped ' the tragedy which has caused the resignation is only temporary . ' " <P> Useless Sympathy , With such views current in the House of Commons , the future course of His Majesty 's Government regarding Ethiopia seemed certain to take its bearings from basic factors which have not changed in the slightest because of the resignation of Sir Samuel Hoare . These factors he ably set forth . <P> The Hoare-Laval Deal to make peace between Italy and Ethiopia , mainly at the expense of Ethiopia but leaving the greater and by far the richest portion of the Empire intact ( TIME , Dec. 23 ) , Sir Samuel approached not apologetically but with a brisk question as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace have in fact been made by the Emperor , the Dictator and the League . Ignorance was obvious on all sides . Many M.P.s sat up to listen as though hearing for the first time much which they might have read weeks and months ago in the Press . As if for the first time , the House seemed to learn that last autumn Haile Selassie offered to cede territory to win Peace* ; that Italy has juridical claims upon British and French tolerance of her intrusion of Ethiopia based on the treaty of 1906 and the exchange of notes of 1925 ; and finally that in the past , when British aid has been offered in a spirit of idealism to native peoples such as the Arabs of famed Colonel T. E. Lawrence 's Revolt in the Desert , results have too often been dishonorable . <P> " I have been terrified , " cried Sir Samuel , " at the thought we might lead Ethiopia to think the League could do more than it can , and that finally we should find a terrible moment of disillusionment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
