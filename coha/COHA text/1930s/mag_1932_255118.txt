A past ( 1917-18 ) president of the American Medical Association , Professor Arthur Dean Bevan of the University of Chicago , recently told a subcommittee of the U. S. Senate that a great many doctors sign their liquor prescriptions in blank and sell them to druggists . That gives the druggists legal security to sell whiskey to any customer . If the doctor is called to account he dare not deny his complicity , sometimes goes to jail . <P> The medical economics of the situation incensed Professor Bevan : " Any rich man in Chicago today can buy a case , that is 24 pints , of whiskey at the corner drugstore for from $150 to $165 a case . That is made possible by three factors , the bootlegging druggist , the bootlegging doctor and the bootlegger . The druggist buys it at about $40 a case . One doctor or several doctors furnish the prescriptions at $3 apiece or a total of $72 . That makes $112 . The bootlegger and the druggist split the rest . " <P> But in condonation he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States , at least 80,000 have an annual income of $2,500 or considerably less . A doctor is allowed 400 prescriptions a year . At $3 apiece it is a terrific temptation for a man making $2,000 a year to have an opportunity to make $1,200 extra . " <P> Dr. Bevan was of the opinion that nine out of ten liquor prescriptions are bootlegged . In Connecticut , he had heard that 99.9% of the 2,000 doctors " take out liquor prescription books and write prescriptions . " <P> Was eminent Dr. Bevan a telltale , fussbudget , or ignoramus ? By last week U. S. Medicine had not decided . But there was much squawking . <P> Dr. William Frederick Lorenz , University of Wisconsin professor of psychiatry who attended the Senate hearing with Dr. Bevan resented " any inference that dominantly the profession is engaged in bartending . " Querulous members of the Chicago Medical Society , to which Dr. Bevan belongs , cried for his condemnation , if not ousting . <P> Stormed the Journal of the American Medical Association : " Unfortunate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Extraordinary lack of confidence in his professional brethren . " <P> The Medical Society of the County of New York , potent in the East , and touchy , bellowed " disbelief and disapproval . "
