DON GYPSY-Walter Starkie-Button ( $3-50 ) . <P> If you are fat and fortyish , but a fiddler you might possibly be able to spend your vacations the way Professor Starkie does . <P> But unless you were also at home in three or four languages , one of them Calo ( Gypsy ) , you could not follow his footsteps very nearly . Few men have so succeeded in combining the respectable with the vagabond life . In term-time Walter Starkie is professor of Spanish literature in Dublin University , a director of the Abbey Theatre , the most indefatigable diner-out in Dublin , with a finger in every literary , academic and musical pie . With the beginning of the summer vacation he says good-by to all that ( and his wife and two children ) , tucks his fiddle under his arm . stuffs 3 in his pocket for emergencies , and hies him off to Hungary , Rumania . Spain , to play tunes for his supper . Last week he published the account of his latest wanderings : this time they took him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gypsy songs and customs than with gorgio ( non-gypsy ) politics . Fiddler Starkie had little seismic to report of a land that was soon to become a volcano of civil war . Only headlined name he mentioned was that of Largo Caballero. whom he heard characterized as a big-talking bourgeois . <P> Following no set itinerary , Fiddler Starkie started playing in the Tangier streets for coppers , was soon invited to make one of a brothel orchestra . In Andalusia he joined a circus , left it after a single performance in which his fiddle-playing act degenerated into a clownish tussle . In the gypsy caves of Granada he spent a riotous night . Knowing the gypsies of old . he rarely had trouble scraping acquaintance with members of the tribe . <P> Once he spent three uncomfortable days and nights in a gypsy camp , during which time he was the anxious witness of four fights , blood-letting but invariably ending in kisses . Occasionally he was led into temptation , but never forgot that he was a married man . <P> As a kind of sentimental homage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilgrimage to La Mancha , in Don Quixote 's footsteps . Unfortunately , although he often felt like Don Quixote , he looked much more like Sancho Panza. was once so hounded by a pack of small boys that he sought sanctuary in a church . <P> When he emerged , one of his tormentors came up and apologized , explained that they had picked on him because he was a stranger- " besides , you were so fat and all . " Readers who are in a hurry may grow impatient with the meanderings of this musical picaroon ; but for those who enjoy armchair travel and are not averse to scholarly or musical digressions by the way , Don Gypsy is a better than " tiny dose of Pantagruelian jollity of mind pickled in the scorn of fortune .
