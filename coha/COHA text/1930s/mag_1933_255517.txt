The solemn Aldermen of the City of London are like a pack of cards that is never shuffled . Once a year the top ( senior ) card is slipped off and becomes Lord Mayor . Cards slipped off in previous years return to the rank of Aldermen , designated forever after as having " passed the civic chair " ( i. e. been Lord Mayor ) . Last week in London 's gloomy but impressive Guildhall there was pompous slipping . <P> " Oyez , Oyez , Oyez ! " shouted the Common Crier . " All ye who are not of the Livery depart this hall on pain of imprisonment ! " <P> Nobody stirred . All the Aldermen are " Liverymen " - representatives of London 's ancient Guilds . The top card , as always , was the Senior Alderman who has served as Sheriff of the City of London , this year Alderman Charles Henry Collett . <P> " Those of you in favor of Charles Henry Collett , Knight , Alderman and Glovemaker ? " shouted Common Sergeant Judge Holman Gregory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this shout did not stop the Common Sergeant . He read off the names of all eligible Aldermen . <P> " Later on ! Later on ! " cried the Liverymen at each name , sure that London 's Mayoral pack will be dealt in proper order from now until Doom 's crack . Knowing that her husband was bound to win , Mrs. Collett watched beaming from a balcony beside the outgoing Lord Mayor , Sir Percy Greenaway , Stationer . Sedately the Aldermen , who form a small key group in the great body of Liverymen , retired to vote in private for the inevitable top card . <P> Emerging at last through a great door , they introduced and presented to the Liverymen as though they had never seen him before Glovemaker Collett of the Worshipful Company of glovers , a tycoon of British haberdashery . After congratulations all round , Stationer Lord Mayor Sir Percy Greenaway invited Glover Collett into the ornate Lord Mayor 's coach , carried him off to a reception at the Mansion House while four trumpeters split the air with deafening blasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected last week , will not assume office until Lord Mayor 's Day , Nov. 9 , must spend at least 3,000 to please the London populace by staging that pompous , freakish annual pageant , " The Lord Mayor 's Show , " plus 3,000 for the Lord Mayor 's banquet . Paid an annual salary and allowance of 50,000 , the Lord Mayor of London normally spends some 30,000 of it on civic entertainment during his year in office .
