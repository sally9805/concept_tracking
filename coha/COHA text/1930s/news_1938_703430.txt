txt Evaluating the Legion Opinion Is Expressed That " Treasury Raiding " Is the Real " Danger " To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I have read Dr. Gellermann 's book on the American Legion . He is raising a large sheet on a pole and scaring little children . His thesis is that the American Legion is a canker in the breast of the Republic , and he may be right or he may be wrong . It all depends on the trends of our social structure . If , perchance , the country gets into desperate straits , as Germany got , and is looking for a Fascist Government , the Legion might well become the nucleus around which such a movement might gravitate and the Legion commander might become the American dictator . If , however , we pull through and keep on a reasonably even keel , neither the Legion nor any other outfit can have much effect of a serious nature . Dr. Gellermann is right about the leadership of the Legion . These birds all have fat jobs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into fields very foreign to the original concepts of the founding fathers of the Legion . Any organization is prone to do that , but we have always had somebody to call attention to the straying . Keeping Things Stirred Up As long as the Legion membership puts up the dough , just so long will the leaders lead ? at so much per lead . If they did n't keep things stirred up and controversial issues in the forefront , there would be nothing to do and the jobs would peter out . The boys in the front office will see to it that there is always some bogy to fight and some benefits to flow from their efforts to the members . Everybody not a damn fool knows that . The good doctor has missed the point on the real danger of the American Legion 's total disregard of the welfare of the country by-raiding its Treasury . Had Dr. Gellermann devoted his time and effort to setting forth the damage the Legion has done by plastering taxes on the citizens and showing up the methods which the Legion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a much better job . The ordinary Legionnaire is in the small-town post and that is the hub of the social universe . He loves to put on a clambake , a uniform and march around blowing a bazoo , to the delight of the populace . He knows nothing of the leaders and cares less . Men , for some cockeyed reason , delight in uniforms and a lot of parading . The Legion supplies this outlet . If it were not the Legion it would be the Sons of Bella/ or something else . We have nothing to fear from the ordinary Legionnaire . He will never tear down the temple . So long as things go on an even keel he will never support his leaders if they try to tear it down , either . No " United Front So far as fighting " subversive elements " is concerned and battling communism , Dr. Gellermann truly says that the Legion is as divided on the definitions of those things as the rest of us . After all , until people settle on some really definite object they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its " education " policy , I do n't think that the Legion has any . Surely , the Legion is not big enough to steer education of the young in any given direction . So what ? I think that the doctor should go back and try again . He is dead right in a lot of things and scared to death of a lot of other things which are not calculated to scare the thinking man . I do not think that we can support Dr. Gellermann in his conclusions about all the Legion being Fascist . I think that the Legion is Fascist and unpatriotic and everything else that savors of a racket at the top , but the rank and file are just plain dumb clucks who hope for some money from the government , who love to march around the square pretending that they are heroes either going to or returning from battle while the mammas cheer .. I think that somebody should point out to Dr. Gellermann that he has missed the point and should really examine the " Legion Danger " ? Treasury raiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Webster on Education ' To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Dr. George D. Strayer in Thin TIMES of July 13 expressed his opposition to President Roosevelt 's proposal to extend Federal money to parochial schools . It would be interesting to know how he reconciles his stand with those sentiments in the Ordinance of 1787 , to which Daniel Webster refers as follows : " It need hardly be said that that paper expresses just sentiments on the great subject of civil and religious liberty . Such sentiments were common , and abound in all our State papers of that day . But this Ordinance did that which was not so common , and which is not even now universal ; that is , it set forth and declared it to be a high and binding duty of government itself to support schools and advance the means of education , on the plain reason that religion , morality and knowledge are necessary to good government , and to the happiness of mankind . " Religion , morality and knowledge were never before in our history more essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these should , in all justice , be aided , not discriminated against . The President 's ? aim to deal justly in this regard , I frankly believe , will not in any way interfere with the doctrine of separation of church and State . JERE J. ALcoom . Brooklyn , July 13 , 1938 . Landscape Architects ' Fees To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW Yosx TIMES : The landscape architects of New York are much distressed by Miss Esther C. , Grayson 's statement in THE TIMES of July 10 : " Landscape architects , because of the high fees which their profession commands , are often beyond the reach of the moderate pocketbook . " It seems to the New York Chapter , ? American Society of Landscape Architects , that this statement is deliberately unfair . We have no set fees for con. sultations and they may range according to the reputation of the member and the importance of the work from practically nothing up . The older members of our profession become daily more ' humble as they realize the- extent of their field , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of horticulture , and years of practical experience to produce a worthy result . It is our belief that the client gets about what he pays for and that there is more chance of overpaying the " garden consultant " than there is of overpaying the landscape architect .

Suggesting a Way Out Gifts of Public Land to Farm-Minded Folk Urged as Economy Measure To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Impressed by the current unemployment and feeling that farm life offers real help in lessening the same , I some time ago wrote to Secretary Wallace outlining a plan for allocating to farmminded couples in our cities small areas of public land which would become their own and be deeded to them after a year of industrious occupation . In reply to my letter Roy F. Hendrickson , an assistant to Mr. Wallace , wrote me that " with the loss of foreign markets the opportunities for inexperienced persons or those ' without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I had , however , no idea of commercial agriculture when I wrote to Secretary Wallace , but was thinking primarily of a means whereby couples might assist in their own self-support so that the pressure for increased governmental expenditure might be lessened and individuals heretofore dependent on . the government rendered less dependent and made in some degree conscious of their rights as proprietors , with measurable chances for self-maintenance . Since my letter to the Secretary I have been forced by facts to believe my position justified . I think we need an increased land-owning population , proud of their own initiative in dealing with the problems of the soil ; and fortunately , there is vast material for such a class right in the heart of all our great towns where the back yards of thousands of workers ' families prove their native gift for gardening . Let us say our farmer never gets rich , yet his chance for permanent self-support exceeds that of the WPA man who faces the chance of unemployment at short Notice . My objective is the welfare of plain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objective as realizing an ever-lessening ' demand on our Treasury . Is it not time that we gave a chance of cooperation with the sources of wealth ( the land itself ) to a far greater proportion of our city working people than we have yet done ? , Would it not be an economy and promote independency ? If our present intriguing substitutes for this habituate millions to look to governmental agencies rather than to their own inherent powers for present and future livelihood , let us consider a better way out .

Peter Stuyvesant 's Statue TO THE EDITOR OF TEE NEW YORK TIMESI May I add one or two details to a report in THE TIMES of July 9 concerning the erection of a statue of Peter Stuyvesant , Director General ( not Governor General , as stated ) on the grounds of the Netherlands Pavilion of the New York World 's Fair . More than two years ago the Netherland-America Foundation , with a view to reclaiming in the popular mind the identity of Stuyvesant Square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stuyvesant as a permanent memorial in that somewhat forgotten portion of Peter Stuyvesant 's old farm . Mrs. Whitney 's sketch was accepted by the foundation 's Stuyvesant Statue Committee , of which Mrs. A. Barton Hepburn is chairman and Mrs. Adolphe Boissevain is treasurer , by the Park Department and the Municipal Art Commission . The statue on which Mrs. Whitney Is working in its enlarged form will in due course be erected in Stuyvesant Square on a site set aside by the city . In the meantime , with the hearty approval of Mrs. Whitney and the Netherland-America Foundation , it will be exhibited on the grounds of the Netherlands Pavilion during the World 's Faia , NEIL VAN AKEN , Secretary Netherlands Participation Committee .
