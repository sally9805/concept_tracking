THE HAPPIEST MAN ON EARTH A STORY BY ALBERT MALTZ J EssE felt ready to weep . He had been sitting in the shanty waiting for Tom to appear , grateful for the chance to rest his injured foot , quietly , joyously anticipating the moment when Torn would say , " Why of course , Jesse , you can start whenever you 're ready ! " Fortwoweeks he had been pushing himself , from Kansas City , Missouri , to Tulsa , Oklahoma , through nights of rain and a week of scorching sun , without sleep or a decent meal , sustained by the vision of that one moment . And then Tom had come into the office . He had come in quickly , holding a sheaf of papers in his hand ; he had glanced at Jesse only casually , it was true  --  but long enough . He had not known him . He had turned away . . .. And Tom Brackett was his brother-in-law . Was it his clothes ? Jesse knew he looked terrible . He had tried to spruce up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had gone badly ; in his excitement he had cut himself shaving , an ugly gash down the side of his cheek . And nothing could get the red gumbo dust out of his suit even though he had slapped himself till both arms were worn out . . . . Or was it just that he had changed so much ? True , they had n't seen each other for five years ; but Tom looked five years older , that was all . He was still Tom . God ! was he so different ? Brackett finished his telephone call . He leaned back in his swivel chair and glanced over at Jesse with small , clear blue eyes that were suspicious and unfriendly . He was a heavy , paunchy man of forty-five , auburn-haired , rather dour looking ; his face was meaty , his features pronounced and forceful , his nose somewhat bulbous and reddish-hued at the tip . He looked like a solid , decent , capable business man who was commander of his local branch of the American Legion  --  which he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spend time on him . Even the way he chewed his toothpick seemed contemptuous to Jesse . " Yes ? " Brackett said suddenly . " What do you want ? " His voice was decent enough , Jesse admitted . He had expected it to be worse . He moved up to the wooden counter that partitioned the shanty . He thrust a hand nervously through his tangled hair . " I guess you do n't recognize me , Tom , " he said falteringly , " I 'm Jesse Fulton . " " Huh ? " Brackett said . That was all . " Yes , I am , and Ella sends you her love . " Brackett rose and walked over to the counter until they were face to face . He surveyed Fulton incredulously , trying to measure the resemblance to his brother-in-law as he remembered him . This man was tall , about thirty . That fitted ! He had straight good features and a lank erect body . That was right too . But the face was too gaunt , the body too spiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His brother-in-law had been a solid , strong young man with muscle and beef to him . It was like looking at a faded , badly taken photograph and trying to recognize the subject : the resemblance was there but the difference was tremendous . He searched the eyes . They at least seemed definitely familiar , gray , with a curiously shy but decent look in them . He had liked that about Fulton . Jesse stood quiet . Inside he was seething . Brackett was like a man examining a piece of broken-down horse flesh ; there was a look of pure pity in his eyes . It made Jesse furious . He knew he was n't as far gone as all that . " Yes , I believe you are , " Brackett said finally , " but you sure have changed . " " By God , it 's five years , ai n't it ? " Jesse said resentfully . " You only saw me a couple of times anyway . " Then , to himself , with his lips locked together , in mingled vehemence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't everybody ? I ai n't no corpse . " You was solid looking , " Brackett continued softly , in the same tone of incredulous wonder . " You lost weight , I guess ? " Jesse kept silent . He needed Brackett too much to risk antagonizing him . But it was only by deliberate effort that he could keep from boiling over . The pause lengthened , became painful . Brackett flushed . " Jiminy Christmas , excuse me , " he burst out in apology . He jerked the counter up . " Come in . Take a seat . Good God , boy " ? he grasped Jesse 's hand and shook it ? " I am glad to see you ; do n't think anything elsel You just looked so peaked . " " It 's all right , " Jesse murmured . He sat down , thrusting his hand through his curly , tangled hair . " Why are you limping ? " " I stepped on a stone ; it jagged a hole through my shoe . " Jesse pulled his feet back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had come from the Relief originally , and two weeks on the road had about finished them . All morning , with a kind of delicious , foolish solemnity , he had been vowing to himself that before anything else , before even a suit of clothes , he was going to buy himself a brand new strong pair of shoes . Brackett kept his eyes off Jesse 's feet . He knew what was bothering the boy and it filled his heart with pity . The whole thing was appalling . He had never seen anyone who looked more down and out . His sister had been writing to him every week , but she had n't told him they were as badly off as this . " Well now , listen , " Brackett began , " tell me things . How 's Ella ? " " Oh , she 's pretty good , " Jesse replied absently . He had a soft , pleasing , rather shy voice that went with his soft gray eyes . He was worrying over how to get started . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine .... Well , you know , " Jesse added , becoming more attentive , " the young one has to wear a brace . He ca n't run around , you know . But he 's smart . He draws pictures and he does things , you know . " " Yes , " Brackett said . " That 's good . " He hesitated . There was a moment 's silence . Jesse fidgeted in his chair . Now that the time had arrived , he felt awkward . Brackett leaned forward and put his hand on Jesse 's knee . " Ella did n't tell me things were so bad for you , Jesse . I might have helped . " " Well , goodness , " Jesse returned softly , " you been having your own troubles , ai n't you ? " " Yes . " Brackett leaned back . His ruddy face became mournful and darkly bitter . ? You know I lost my hardware shop ? " " Well sure , of course , " Jesse answered , surprised . " You wrote us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot , " Brackett said . " I keep on being surprised over it myself . Not that it was worth much , " he added bitterly . " It was running down hill for three years . I guess I just wanted it because it was mine , " He laughed pointlessly , without mirth . " Well tell me about yourself , " he asked . " ' What happened to the job you had ? " Jesse burst out abruptly , with agitation , " Let it wait , Tom , I got something on my mind . " " It ai n't you and Ella ? " Brackett interrupted anxiously . " Why no ! " Jesse sat back . " Why however did you come to think that ? Why Ella and me ? " he stopped , laughing . " Why , Tom , I 'm just crazy about Ella . Why she 's just wonderful . She 's just my whole life , Tom . " " Excuse me . Forget it . " Brackett chuckled uncomfortably , turned away . The naked intensity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It made him wish savagely that he could do something for them . They were both too decent to have had it so hard . Ella was like this boy too , shy and a little soft . " Tom , listen , " Jesse said , " I come here on purpose . " He thrust his hand through his hair . " I want you to help me . " " Damn it , boy , " Brackett groaned . He had been expecting this . " I ca n't much . I only get thirty-five a week and I 'm damn grateful for it . " " Sure , I know , " Jesse emphasized excitedly . He was feeling once again the wild , delicious agitation that had possessed him in the early hours of the morning . " I know you ca n't help us with money But we met a man who works for you ! He was in our city ! He said you could give me a job ! " " Who said ? " " Oh , why did n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why as soon as I heard it I started out . For two weeks now I been pushing ahead like crazy . " Brackett groaned aloud . " You come walking from Kansas City in two weeks so I could give you a job ? " " Sure , Tom , of course . What else could I do ? " " God Almighty , there ai n't no jobs , Jesse ! It 's a slack season . And you do n't know this oil business . It 's special . I got my Legion friends here but they could n't do nothing now . Do n't you think I 'd ask for you as soon as there was a chance ? " Jesse felt stunned . The hope of the last two weeks seemed rolling up into a ball of agony in his stomach . Then , frantically , he cried , " But listen , this man said you could hire ! He told mel He drives trucks for you ! He said you always need men ! " " Ohl . . . You mean my department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , Tom . That 's i t I " " Oh , no , you do n't want to work in my department , " Brackett told him in the same low voice . " You do n't know what it is . " " Yes , I do , " Jesse insisted . " He told me all about it , Tom . You 're a dispatcher , ai n't you ? You send the dynamite trucks out ? " " Who was the man , Jesse ? " " Everett , Everett , I think . " " Egbert ? Man about my size ? " Brackett asked slowly . " Yes , Egbert . He was n't a phony , was he ? " Brackett laughed . For the second time his laughter was curiously without mirth . " No , he was n't a phony . " Then , in a changed voice : " Jimmy , boy , you should have asked me before you trekked all the way down here . " " Oh , I did n't want to , " Jesse explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' no . ' He told me it was risky work , Tom . But I do n't care . " Brackett locked his fingers together . His solid , meaty face became very hard . " I 'm going to say ' no ' anyway , Jesse . " Jesse cried out . It had not occurred to him that Brackett would not agree . It had seemed as though reaching Tulsa were the only problem he had to face . " Oh , no , " he begged , " you ca n't . Ai n't there any jobs , Tom ? " " Sure , there 's jobs . There 's even Egbert 's job if you want it . " " He 's quit ? " " He 's dead ! " " Ohl " " On the job , Jesse . Last night if you want to know . " " Ohl " . . . Then , " I do n't care ! " " Now you listen to me , " Brackett said . " I 'll tell you a few things that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't dynamite you drive . They do n't use anything as safe as dynamite in drilling oil wells . They wish they could , but they ca n't . It 's nitroglycerin ! Soup ! " " But I know , " Jesse told him reassuringly . " He advised me , Tom . You do n't have to think I do n't know . " " Shut up a minute , " Brackett ordered angrily . " Listen ! You just have to look at this soup , see ? You just cough loud and it blows ! You know how they transport it ? In a can that 's shaped like this , . see , like a fan ? That 's to give room for compartments , because each compartment has to be lined with rubber . That 's the only way you can even think of handling it . " " Listen , Tom ? " " Now wait a minute , Jesse . For God 's sake just put your mind to this . I know you had your heart set on a job , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in special trucks ! At night ! They got to follow a special route ! They ca n't go through any city ! If they lay over , it 's got to be in a special garage ! Do n't you see what that means ? Do n't that tell you how dangerous it is ? " " I 'll drive careful , " Jesse said . " I know how to handle a truck . I 'll drive slow . " Brackett groaned . " Do you think Egbert did n't drive careful or know how to handle a truck ? " " Tom , " Jesse said earnestly , " you ca n't scare me . I got my mind fixed on only one thing : Egbert said he was getting a dollar a mile . He was making five to six hundred dollars a month for half a month 's work , he said . Can I get the same ? " " Sure , you can get the same , " Brackett told him savagely . " A dollar a mile . It 's easy . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much ? It 's easy  --  until you run over a stone that your headlights did n't pick out , like Egbert did . Or get a blowout ! Or get something in your eye , so the wheel twists and you jar the truck ! Or any other God damn thing that nobody ever knows ! We ca n't ask Egbert what happened to him . There 's no truck to give any evidence . There 's no corpse . There 's nothing ! Maybe tomorrow somebody 'll find a piece of twisted steel way off in a cornfield . But we never find the driver . Not even a finger nail . All we know is that he do n't come in on schedule . Then we wait for the police to call us . You know what happened last night ? Something went wrong on a bridge . Maybe Egbert was nervous . Maybe he brushed the side with his fender . Only there 's no bridge any more . No truck . No Egbert , Do you understand now ? That 's what you get for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment of silence . Jesse sat twisting his long thin hands . His mouth was sagging open , his face was agonized . Then he shut his eyes and spoke softly . " I do n't care about that , Tom . You told me . Now you got to be good to me and give me the job . " Brackett slapped the palm of his hand down on his desk . " No ! " " Listen , Tom , " Jesse said softly , " you just do n't understand . " He opened his eyes . They were filled with tears . They made Brackett turn away . " Just look at me , Tom . Do n't that tell you enough ? What did you think of me when you first saw me ? You thought : ' Why do n't that bum go away and stop panhandling ? ' Did n't you , Tom ? Tom , I just ca n't live like this any more . I got to be able to walk down the street with my head up . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's one out of five drivers gets killed . That 's the average . What 's worth that ? " " Is my life worth anything now ? We 're just starving at home , Tom . They ai n't put us back on relief yet . " " Then you should have told me , " Brackett exclaimed harshly . " It 's your own damn fault . A man has no right to have false pride when his family ai n't eating . borrow some money and we 'll telegraph it to Ella . Then you go home and get back on relief . " " And then what ? " " And then wait , Cod damn it ! You 're no old man . You got no right to throw your life away . Sometime you 'll get a job . " " No ! " Jesse jumped up . " No . I believed that too . But I do n't now , " he cried passionately . " I ai n't getting a job no more than you 're getting your hardware store back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skilled work . I 'm rusty now . I 've been six years on relief . The only work I 've had is pick and shovel . When I got that job this spring I was supposed to be an A-1 man . But I was n't . And they got new machines now . As soon as the slack started they let me out . " " So what ? " Brackett said harshly . " Ai n't there other jobs ? " " How do I know ? " Jesse replied . " There ai n't been one for six years . I 'd even be afraid to take one now . It 's been too hard waiting so many weeks to get back on relief . " " Well you got to have some courage , " Brackett shouted . " You 've got to keep up hope . " " I got all the courage you want , " Jesse retorted vehemently , " but no , I ai n't got no hope . The hope has dried up in me in six years ' waiting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're crazy , " Brackett muttered . " I wo n't do it . For God 's sake think of Ella for a minute . " " Do n't you know I 'm thinking about her ? " Jesse asked softly . He plucked at Brackett 's sleeve . " That 's what decided me , Tom . " His voice became muted into a hushed , pained whisper . " The night Egbert was at our house I looked at Ella like I 'd seen her for the first time . She ai n't pretty any more , Tom ! " Brackett jerked his head and moved away . Jesse followed him , taking a deep , sobbing breath . " Do n't that tell you , Tom ? Ella was like a little doll or something , you remember . I could n't walk down the street without somebody turning to look at her . She ai n't twenty-nine yet , Tom , and she ai n't pretty no more . " Brackett sat down with his shoulders hunched up wearily . He gripped his hands together and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood over him , his gaunt face flushed with emotion , almost unpleasant in its look of pleading and bitter humility . " I ai n't done right for Ella , Tom . Ella deserved better . This is the only chance I see in my whole life to do something for her . I 've just been a failure . " " Do n't talk nonsense , " Brackett commented , without rancor . " You ai n't a failure . No more than me . There 's millions of men in the identical situation . It 's just the depression , or the recession , or the God damn New Deal , or . . . l " He swore and lapsed into silence . " Oh , no , " Jesse corrected him , in a knowing , sorrowful tone , " those things maybe excuse other men . But not me . It was up to me to do better . This is my own fault ! " " Oh , beans ! " Brackett said . " It 's more sun spots than it 's you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It looked swollen . " Well , I do n't care , " he cried wildly . " I do n't care ! You got to give me this ! I got to lift my head up . I went through one stretch of hell but I ca n't go through another . You want me to keep looking at my little boy 's legs and tell myself if I had a job he would n't be like that ? Every time he walks he says to me , ' I got soft bones from the rickets and you give it to me because you did n't feed me right . ' Jesus Christ , Tom , you think I 'm going to sit there and watch him like that another six years ? " Brackett leaped to his feet . " So what if you do ? " he shouted . " You say you 're thinking about Ella . How 's she going to like it when you get killed ? " " Maybe I wo n't , " Jesse pleaded . " I 've got to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all think , " Brackett replied scornfully . " When you take this job your luck is a question mark . The only thing certain is that sooner or later you get killed . " " Okay then , " Jesse shouted back . " Then I do ! But meanwhile I got something , do n't I ? I can buy a pair of shoes . Look at me ! I can buy a suit that do n't say ' Relief ' by the way it fits . I can smoke cigarettes . I can buy some candy for the kids . I can eat some myself . Yes , by God , I want to eat some candy . I want a glass of beer once a day . I want Ella dressed up . I want her to eat meat three times a week , four times maybe . I want to take my family to the movies . " Brackett sat down . " Oh , shut up , " he said wearily . " No , " Jesse told him softly , passionately , " you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he pleaded , " I got it all figured out . On six hundred a month look how much I can save ! If I last only three months , look how much it is  --  a thousand dollars  --  more ! And maybe I 'll last longer . Maybe a couple years . I can fix Ella up for life ! " " You said it , " Brackett interposed . " I suppose you think she 'll enjoy living when you 're on a job like that ? " " I got it all figured out , " Jesse answered excitedly . " She do n't know , see ? I tell her I make only forty . You put the rest in a bank account for her , Tom . " " Oh , shut up , " Brackett said . " You think you 'll be happy ? Every minute , waking and sleeping , you 'll be wondering if to-morrow you 'll be dead . And the worst days will be your days off , when you 're not driving . They have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . And you lay around the house eating your heart out . That 's how happy you 'll be . " Jesse laughed . " 111 be happy ! Do n't you worry , I 'll be so happy , I 'll be singing . Lord God , Tom , I 'm going to feel proud of myself for the first time in seven years ! " " Oh , shut up , shut up , " Brackett said . The little shanty became silent . After a moment Jesse whispered : " You got to , Tom . You got to . You got to . " Again there was silence . Brackett raised both hands to his head , pressing the palms against his temples . " Torn , Tom ? " Jesse said . Brackett sighed . " Oh God damn it , " he said finally , " all right , I 'll take you on , God help me . " His voice was low , hoarse , infinitely weary . " If you 're ready to drive to-night , you can drive to-night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brackett looked up . The tears were running down Jesse 's face . He was swallowing and trying to speak , but only making an absurd , gasping noise . " I 'll send a wire to Ella , " Brackett said in the same hoarse , weary voice . " I 'll tell her you got a job , and you 'll send her fare in a couple of days . You 'll have some money then  --  that is , if you last the week out , you jackass ! " Jesse only nodded . His heart felt so close to bursting that he pressed both hands against it , as though to hold it locked within his breast . " Come back here at six o'clock , " Brackett said . " Here 's some money . Eat a good meal . " " Thanks , " Jesse whispered . " Wait a minute , " Brackett said . " Here 's my address . " He wrote it on a piece of paper . " Take any car going that way . Ask the conductor where to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Thanks , " Jesse said . " Thanks , Tom . " " Oh , get out of here , " Brackett said . " Tom . " " What ? " " I just ? " Jesse stopped . Brackett saw his face . The eyes were still glistening with tears , but the gaunt face was shining now , with a kind of fierce radiance . Bracken turned away . " I 'm busy , " he said . Jesse went out . The wet film blinded him but the whole world seemed to have turned golden . He limped slowly , with the blood pounding his temples and a wild , incommunicable joy in his heart . " I 'm the happiest man in the world , " he whispered to himself . " I 'm the happiest man on the whole earth . " Bracken sat watching till finally Jesse turned the corner of the alley and disappeared . Then he hunched himself over , with his head in his hands . His heart was beating painfully , like something old and clogged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in desperate tranquillity , gripping his head in his hands .
