txt " Johnny " Weinstein , the pepperytempered Washington Street produce dealer , hotly denied Detective Charles S. Corbett 's story of the $100,000 bribe offer in the Drukman murder case yesterday . Instead , he gave a new version which depicted the detective as actually a grasping bribe-seeker . Weinstein , testifying in the trial of the five men accused of conspiracy before Supreme Court Justice Erskine C. Rogers in Brooklyn , said the State 's chief witness had distorted completely a conversation the two men had shortly after the murder of Samuel Drukman . It was Weinstein , according to Corbett , who offered the $100 , - 000 . Corbett came to him , the witness said , and asked for an opportunity to " get in " on some of the money which he " heard " was being made available by the Drukman defendants . The detective 's zeal for collecting graft in the market district was so marked , according to Weinstein , that he was reputed-to have been willing even to " take a red-hot stove . " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weinstein has been mentioned throughout the trial as " Johnny " Weinstein , but his real name is Abraham J. Weinstein . He turned out to be as sensational a witness as Corbett himself . His explosive manner , his racy characterizations and his insistence on cross-examining his inquisitors caused an uproar in the court . The defense version of the bribe story was only one phase of the broad attack begun yesterday on Corbett 's entire testimony . A police captain called to the stand by the defense denied several important parts of the detective 's testimony , but he also supported other significant points brought out earlier by the State . Detective Giusseppe F. L. Dardis , one of the defendants , took the stand and was put through a long direct examination by his counsel , Leo Healy , who attempted to show that during the period the alleged conspiracy was under way Dardis was diligently at work every day digging up evidence . The detective 's wife , a motherly looking woman , likewise testified concerning the family 's financial affairs . The prosecution had brought out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a $500 bribe in the Drukman case , had a substantial bank account which was augmented frequently by large deposits . Not Told of Bribe Story The police captain was John T. , in charge of the Brooklyn homicide squad , who testified to a number of conversations involving not only Corbett but other persons mentioned in the conspiracy indictment . He admitted that Corbett made no mention to him of the bribe story , denied Corbett 's assertion that Chief Assistant District Attorney Frederick J. Kopff had given an order to " pull off " the case , and denied the detective 's story that Assistant District Attorney William F. was " drunk " when he questioned Drukman witnesses on the night of the murder . The defense also succeeded in getting on the record some medical testimony concerning Corbett 's mentality , which the defense contends is badly impaired . This witness was Police Surgeon Joseph S. Baldwin , who told the jury that Corbett was crying when he examined him early this year . He added that Corbett was highly emotional . Weinstein , a sportily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air of one whose name had been bandied about too much . He readily admitted that Corbett had sought him out at his place of business , shortly after the murder . Corbett said he went to Weinstein , whom he had known for years . seeking evidence against Meyer Luckman , one of the murderers , who operated a trucking business in the market district . " Corbett said did I think they would kill this man for $3,000 , " testified the witness , " and I said , ' Why , that 's foolish , Corbett . Those men can get fifty or a hundred thousand dollars any time they want it . I would give it to them if I had it myself . Why , they 've got a friend , Abe Rosenblum , up the block , who is very friendly with them and who can get anything they have got . ' " $3,000 Found at the Scene It was recalled that $3,000 in cash was found at the murder scene on March 3 , 1935 , when Meyer and Harry Luckman and Fred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Luckman garage . The three men , who were caught with the body in the garage , were exonerated by the regular grand jury , but were convicted after the case was reopened . Corbett , it was also recalled , had testified that Weinstein mentioned Rosenblum as the " money man " and the " big shot " in the case . The witness denied Corbett 's assertion that he had said " there was a man a block or so away who would have $100,000 in ten minutes " for Corbett and Dardis . He denied telling Corbett that " a big mob " was behind the Luckmans . He did , however , assert that Corbett telephoned him later at his home at 2.710 Avenue K , Brooklyn , and asked to see him . " I said , ' There 's no place like my own home , Charlie , ' " declared the , witness . " He said he would come there right away . He came to my home and he said , ' Johnny , I understand the Luckmans are handing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I want to Ifs taken care of . ' " I said , ' What can I do about it ? Why are you picking on me ? ' and he said , ' They are friends of yours and you can speak to them . ' I said , ' If you are a friend of mine you would n't send me on a message like that . ' I told him I would n't do it and I asked him to step out of the house . I 've never seen Charlie Corbett since that time . " Did Corbett say what he would do if you did n't get him some money ? " asked Mr. Healy . " He said , ' I will spill the beans , ' or ' I 'll open up , ' or words to that effect . " Cross-Examination Spirited The cross-examination of the witness consisted of an exchange of questions between him and J. Edward Lumbard of the prosecution . In place of the usual yes and no Weinstein shot back a torrent of " why not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And how ! " or a " yes sir-ee . " " Do n't you know , " inquired the mild-mannered prosecutor , " that when Corbett spoke to you about money that was merely his way of getting information on a case ? " " Well , " replied Weinstein , " he would n't refuse money if he got it . Maybe it was his way but he asked for the money just the same . " Mr. Lumbard attempted to refresh Weinstein 's memory on this point from testimony he gave before the grand jury . He read excerpts which caused Weinstein to boil over . He pointed his finger at the surprised prosecutor . " Where 'd you get that ? " he demanded . " Where was that taken ? " The court intervened with an admonishment that he must not be pugnacious . Weinstein sputtered at the judge and turned on Mr. Lumbard with renewed fury . " I want you to tell me where you got that ! " he shouted . Mr. Lumbard smiled and the judge intervened again . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his exertions , " I want to know where he got that . " Reads Testimony Again Mr. Lumbard told him he was reading from the grand jury records and he read the testimony over again . " Did you say that ? " demanded ' he lawyer . Weinstein was now Seaming . " Why , yes , that 's right , " he quietly retorted . Mr. Healy took over the examination again . " Did you ever hear of Corbett taking money elsewhere ? " he asked . " Sure , up in the market , " said Weinstein . " If they did n't come through he would see to it that their things were taken off the sidewalks , and heaven knows what else . " He turned to the jury in the manner of a man who had got started on his favorite topic of conversation . " You men on the jury ? " he addressed them in a confidential tone ? " you men on the jury know what it is when they give out traffic tickets . " Mr. Healy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The defense lawyer asked : " Was n't Corbett 's reputation such that he would take a hot stove ? " The question tickled the witness . He squirmed a delighted assent . " Huh , and the poker too . " Abraham Rosenblum , who followed Weinstein to the stand , tesifled that he had never acted or of , fered to act as " pay-off " man in the case . He denied any connection with the bribe story . " You 're a nice , mild little man , are n't you ? " asked Mr. Healy . " Yes , " the witness replied . Dardis testified that he was born in Italy , came to this country in 1902 and became a policeman in 1912 . He was assigned as Corbett 's partner in 1928 , he said . He was taken over the same ground covered by other witnesses in connection with the murder investigation . But his attorney framed his questions so as to show that Dardis , from the night of the murder until the case against the three men was dismissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly efficient investigation of the case . When court was adjourned he was still testifying on direct examination . His wife , Mrs. Emily Dardis , testified that their two children contributed $15 a week to the family fund , Dardis gave $240 a month , and $50 a month was received from a tenant in their house . This money was kept in the house until $509 was reached , then it was deposited , she said . On cross-examination she admitted that they had bought two houses , one for $13,500 and one for $13,400 , but she said that there were mortgages on both . Charles and Catherine Dardis , the children , corroborated her testimony . The State contends that Dardis received $43,000 in salary from the Police Department between 1920 and 1935 , and during the same period had banked $10,000 and acquired equities in real estate worth $16,000.
