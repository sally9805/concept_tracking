THE HOUSE OF THE LABURNUMS A STORY BY MOLLIE PANTER-DOWNES " T IHIS is the house  --  number eighteen . " " Oh , yes . " She backed to the edge of the pavement , lifted her head , and looked doubtfully at the upper windows . The young man from the agent 's office stooped to put the key in the lock . " It 's a bit stiff . But all it wants is a touch of oil . " The back of his fresh-looking neck and the tips of his raw downy ears were red with the exertion of the little tussle . He glanced up , smiling anxiously . He was young and keen to please . " What an old-fashioned lock . " " Oh , it would be a simple matter to fit a Yak . These are old-fashioned houses , you know . Early nineteenth-century , I should say . " The key turning at this moment seemed to give him confidence . Patting the stucco pillar of the porch , he added more firmly , " Even earlier perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere . " " Ye-es . " They stood in a hall papered in some dark mottled design above a chocolate painted wainscoting . It was lit by a landing window which had small **26;445;TOOLONG panes of three colors , crimson , deep blue , and a harsh purple . The young man opened a door that led to the front room . Turning , with one hand on the door knob and the other hand impressively waving the typewritten list of addresses , he gazed at his client earnestly with his perfectlyround blue eyes , and his voice squeaked and boomed . " This is just the type of house that everyone is after . Everyone , I can assure you . We do n't keep this kind of thing on our books for two minutes . " And the house seemed to be on the point of sprouting wings and flying away , so impatient did he make it sound . It was situated in a terrace in St. John 's Wood . Acacias and laburnums gave it a country air . Someone who had once seen a pagoda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , and this bit of Chinoiserie darkened the downstairs rooms considerably . It was in bad repair . Paint had cracked and plaster wreaths flaked from the ceilings in a Vesuvius trail of ashes . " But it is going for a remarkably low figure , " said the young agent winningly . " It 's certainly the lowest on your list . " " Oh , it 's an absolute bargain . We sha n't have it on our hands long , I can tell you , madam . The air in this part of London is so good . " His firm , it appeared , had the air on their books as well . " And the quiet . " He skipped to the window and opened it . " Yes , the street seems very quiet . " " At night nothing passes . " He frowned sternly . " You might be in the country . " She agreed that the laburnums were very pleasant . But the house oppressed her strangely . She told herself that this THE HOUSE OF was because she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she tried to bring the rooms to life by imagining her curtains at the windows and her furniture against the walls . She tried to picture tired people sleeping here , hungry people eating , and people in a hurry running up and down the stairs . It was in vain . She knew that she could never live here . Perhaps it was the fault of the day , which was gray ; but the upper rooms seemed as dark as the rooms downstairs that were shadowed by the verandah . She felt the most acute depression and a longing to get out in the open air . The place smelled stale and muggy  --  the sort of atmosphere you get in a crowded room where the windows are all closed , the fire roars , and the flowers in the vases are not fresh . But there was no one here and the grates were all cold . This feeling seemed to crystallize in the big bedroom , a fine room with two windows . She felt as though she were swimming through something warm and heavy . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How trying this spring weather is , " she murmured . " Yes , it is close  --  very close , " the young man agreed eagerly . He led the way to the top landing . Preparing to follow him , she paused in the doorway and looked back . A sharp pain shot suddenly through her head , producing a slight sensation of dizziness . As though it were a tableau revealed in a spurt of magnesium ribbon , she saw that the empty room was now occupied by two people . Pale curtains were looped from the wall over a bed on which lay a young woman . Beside her a man knelt and choked her to death . Intent and speechless , almost like lovers helpless with fascination , they gazed in each other 's faces . Her eyes stared , her face was dark and convulsed . He was a big man with hair of a peculiarly vivid shade of red . He was in his shirtsleeves , and his brawny wrists , seeming to shoot out of their cuffs , were covered with curling hairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the sweet pea-covered wallpaper were patches of brighter sweet peas where other people 's pictures had hung . On the top landing the young man glanced out of a window and saw a tennis court where two girls in bright sweaters ran . He thought swiftly of tennis , of his young lady , of warm summer nights , long kisses , dimmed headlights of cars parked on the crunching red grit of new side roads . Sighing , he turned to his client . She was not there . Leaning over the banisters , he saw her standing on the lower landing . She called up to him . " I do n't think it is any use going on . " He ran down the stairs . He was considerably crestfallen . " But you have n't seen it all , madam . There are several excellent rooms ? " " I have seen quite enough . It wo n't do at all . It is not what I want . " And she hastened downstairs , past the red-and-blue window , with the young man trotting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shaken ; her head was splitting with pain . She felt convinced that what she had just seen had been a terrible episode called up out of the past . Although she had had no experience of the kind before , the peasants in Ireland , where she had spent her childhood , had told her that she had the seeing eye . It never occurred to her that her tired brain might have played her tricks . The two faces , the man 's and the woman 's , were so clear in her mind . She had been right to feel that this was a sad , exhausted house . As they went through the hall , she asked : " Who lived here before , do you know ? " Rallying from his wan reverie , the agent 's clerk started forward like a watcher to the bedside of a patient who has decided not to die . " A Miss Wilmott  --  an old lady , I believe . When she died the house came on the market . " " She had lived there for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lived there all her life . That explains the old-fashioned wallpapers and the dark colors , you know . Fresh paint would make a wonderful difference  --  it would be a new place altogether . " " Nothing has ever happened here , has it ? " " Happened ? " He stared . His tie was striped like his cheeks , pink and white . " There was something in the atmosphere , " she murmured . Relieved , he caught joyfully at the word . " Yes , it has got atmosphere , has n't it ? It 's not like these modern houses . It really is an exceptional little property . Early n i ne teen th-century  --  ab-so-lute-lyperiod . You do n't feel . . . ? " " No , no , it wo n't do . " She could not get the experience out of her mind . Whenever she thought of it she had a sharp and dreadful sensation of horror . Again and again the two figures went through their helpless silent charade in her memory . Far from diminishing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the living people round her seem like phantoms . She began to sleep very badly . Afraid of herself , she told her husband , who listened attentively , laughed , and patted her shoulder . " Nonsense ! You were over-tired , the house was depressing . All empty houses are depressing . " " You do n't believe that I saw them ? " " You saw something , my dear ; but what you saw was in your own imagination . Do n't let yourself get fanciful . Take a good tonic . " And he pottered off in his carpet slippers to pack his books in wooden crates , ready to be taken to the new house ; she had been successful in her search . Some weeks later she came face to face with the young woman whom she had seen on the bed in the empty house . It was at a friend 's home . The young woman was introduced to her as Miss Ellen Caber , the niece of the hostess . Good God ! There could be no mistaking that face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a feeling that she was struggling in a nightmare , she watched Miss Caber show off a fine ring with all the little airs of the happy engaged girl . " You are going to be married soon ? " " I think so  --  quite soon . We have found a house already . Robert signed the lease this morning . It is in St. John 's Wood  --  Fulke Terrace . Do you know it ? Ohl " " I 'm so sorry  --  how terribly clumsy of me . Has it gone on your pretty dress ? Yes , I know FriIke Terrace quite well . " " I come from the country , you know , so the trees and gardens up there rather please me . Just now all the lilacs and laburnums are out . At the present moment the house is frightful , but I think it can be made nice . And it 's quiet . Robert particularly insists on quiet . " " Is your fianc ? here ? " " Yes , there he is . You must meet him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked down and saw the red and gold hairs curling over his wrist under the starched cuff . The young couple glanced at her strangely once or twice , for her conversation seemed wild and straying . As soon as possible she went to find her husband and said to him in a low agitated voice : " You remember my story of the empty house in St. John 's Wood ? That is the couple I saw . " " What , Miss Caber and her fiance ? Do n't be ridiculous ! " " It is quite true . They have taken the very house . What shall I do ? " " Do ? Do nothing of course . What 's the matter with you ? I 've never known you as nervy as this before . It 's a coincidence , that 's all . " " You do n't understand . I feel the most terrible responsibility . Whatever I saw , it was a ghastly tragedy and they were the people in it . I 'd know them anywhere . " THE HOUSE OF " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get in such a thoroughly morbid state . I 've never seen a less spooky couple than Miss Caber and Gates . Why not tell them ? They 'd enjoy the joke . " " No , I ca n't . That would be . . . " " Well then , have a drink . " He strolled off to get one for her . He chuckled to himself , putting the whole thing down to his wife 's vivid Irish imagination which was always bursting out in little " feelings " ; quick and often entirely misleading intuitions about people and places . This dash of livelier blood entranced him , and he was fond of pointing it out to strangers as though it were the indigo tongue of a Chow , a sign of genuine stock . He was a plain man himself and went through life without seeing anything peculiar . He relied on his wife for the racy trimmings that lend spice to a solid dish . She could not decide what to do . From her friend she learned that Robert Gates and Miss Caber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terrace . Several times she was on the point of going to see young Mrs. Gates ; each time something happened to prevent it . She felt that if she could only sec the house looking normal , with sunlight streaming through the open windows , new curtains fluttering , half the horror of her experience would be gone . That unlucky visit to the empty house seemed as though it were going to obsess her whole life . It would return to her suddenly , bringing an appalling feeling of uneasiness . She recalled the calm and happy face of Miss Caber , the smiling face of her fianc ? . But she found that she could remember far more vividly the sweet pea pattern of the wallpaper in the stuffy bedroom . She saw the pink and mauve flowers , the delicate tendrils , brighter in patches . She saw the faces , the eyes , and sometimes she felt that she must really be going mad . One summer evening she was in St. John 's Wood , walking to her bus from a visit to a sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fulke Terrace . The lilacs and laburnums had faded ; the young green of the trees was white with dust , and from the tennis courts came the ping of balls and the sound of voices , ringing at once vibrant and languid on the still summer air . In one of the little gardens a man in shirtsleeves pottered happily with a trowel . Everything was peaceful . She was on the opposite side of the road from the Gateses ' house . She paused and looked over . The little house looked smart with new paint . Light curtains hung at the freshly polished windows ; she could see stacked deck chairs in the verandah . She told herself that it had lost its frightening anonymity and was now a happy home belonging to happy daylight folk . Long drying pods hung from the laburnum trees . But suddenly this would not do . Standing on the pavement , with the shirtsleeved man making soft little comfortable scratching noises with his trowel in the warm earth behind the railings , she felt sick with dread . All at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Her heart beat loudly ; her knees shook . She knew that she must cross the street as quickly as possible , ring the bell , and ask for Ellen Gates . For a moment she was unable to move . Behind her the man , squatting on his haunches , scratched in the dirt and the odorous decaying geranium leaves ; slowly the tassels swung from the laburnum trees opposite . As she took a step forward , the door of number eighteen burst open , and a maid , apron strings streaming , terror pasted chalk white across her face , ran shrieking into the street .
