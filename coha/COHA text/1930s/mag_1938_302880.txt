U. S. Attitude <P> Sirs : <P> TIME , March 28 : " But before in the U. S. , world developments over the last year have produced a profound and insufficiently publicized change in attitude toward war in general . Last week the change of attitude was perhaps better indicated by several reactions to the Hull speech than by the speech itself . Wrote Pundit Walter Lippmann : . . . " <P> I read Pundit Lippmann 's column in full . He too made the statement , which he signally failed to support with any evidence , that this country 's people have changed in their attitude toward war during recent months . Now you say the same thing ; or at least I so interpret your rather awkward sentence ; though you do not say whose attitude has been changed , or how many attitudes . <P> I should like very much to have some of this " evidence " you mention . Lacking it , I seriously doubt your and Lippmann 's statements . . . . <P> ARTHUR COLEMAN Associate Editor Holland 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> TIME had no intention of implying that the people in the U. S. are less pacific now than they were when they turned against the League of Nations . But that they are less inclined toward isolation and more inclined to collective action , TIME , considering recent public polls and public utterances of prominent Congressmen , trade unionists , editors , liberals and Democratic wheel-horses , does not doubt. - ED . <P> Hoping &; Praying <P> Sirs : <P> We like your TIME magazine very much but . . . . <P> When we have to memorize it we would just as soon memorize the daily newspaper , and that 's what we are doing in the Public Speaking Class , but it is NOT OUR IDEA . <P> This class is hoping and praying that less goes on , especially in Foreign News also in Business and Finance . <P> OAKRIDGE HIGH SCHOOL Public Speaking Class Oakridge , Ore . <P> Manufacturer <P> Sirs : <P> TIME 's account April 4 of the execution of a small reddish-brown pig at San Quentin . Calif , was incorrect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in twenty seconds and in all probability it was dead within a minute . <P> There has been much erroneous information published about Lethal Gas Chambers and this method of execution , but I did expect TIME to keep their records straight . My company has designed and manufactured Lethal Gas Chambers for all of the six states mentioned except Nevada and Arizona and including Oregon which was omitted . . . . <P> J. R. TRAVIS General Manager Eaton Metal Products Co . Denver , Colo . <P> The report made by W. H. Rockingham of the California State Division of Architecture : <P> At 10:39:20 a. m. cyanide eggs were dropped into a pan of sulfuric acid ; at 10:39:30 the fumes reached the pig . It staggered to its feet nine times . At 10:40:05 it fell to the bottom of the cage . At 10:41:40 all reflex actions stopped , two minutes 20 seconds after the start of the execution. - ED . <P> Backward Mexico <P> Sirs : <P> Reference to TIME March 21 :            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
