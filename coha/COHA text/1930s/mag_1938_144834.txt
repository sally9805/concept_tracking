With one of those gestures which he loves and executes so well , Franklin Roosevelt last week assembled 23 Southerners in Washington and sent them a message which made Page 1 news throughout the South . <P> " It is my conviction , " he said , " that the South presents right now the nation 's No. 1 economic problem-the nation 's problem , not merely the South 's . " <P> He said he had had various of his administrative agencies draw up a statement of the South 's economic handicap and shortcomings . He wanted the 23 Southern gentlemen to examine and discuss this , restate it if they liked until it represented " the South 's own best thought . " Then he would present it to the Congress . To guide the Southern gentlemen 's deliberations he detailed Lowell Mellett , director of his National Emergency Council . <P> The personnel of the deliberating group included assorted college presidents , a Columbia , S. C. lawyer , two minor judges , a C. I. O. organizer , an A. F. of L. delegate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representative of the Southern Tenant Farmers ' Union . Southern business was represented by a lumber man from Picayune , Miss. , a Birmingham banker , an aviation-company official from Dallas , a Virginia utility man , a Ken tucky varnish maker , and President J. Skottowe Wannamaker of the American Cotton Association . <P> Prepared for these gentlemen to frown over and approve was an indictment of the South 's condition as to markets , freight rates , capital , absentee ownership , farm earnings , health , education , soil abuse , fertilizer , power , etc. , etc . The gentlemen solemnly " agreed " to it all , adding Wages &; Hours as a point of their own to be considered . Then they left Washington apparently leaving it up to Director Mellett to frame their " report to the President . " <P> Lowell Mellett , 54 , is a coiner nowadays in the Administration 's inner circle . Brother of the late crusading Editor Don Mellett of the Canton , Ohio News , he , too , is a newspaperman of wide experience . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as a candidate being groomed to succeed wily old Charles Michelson , 69 . Democratic national pressagent ( see p. 27 ) . <P> If he does a good job on the report of the 23 gentlemen from the South , Mr. Mellett will present President Roosevelt with a useful document : a " report " whose homely truths would go down more easily in the South than such blunt criticism of Southern wages and economic standards as Franklin Roosevelt voiced last March at Gainesville ; a basis for Administration action which would then look more like an obedient answer to the South 's requests than Presidential interference in the South 's favorite ways of life .
