Nevada 's sole Representative in Congress , nature-loving former Governor James Graves Scrugham. remembers seeing once , in the high Sierras , a mother eagle pushing her young one by one out of their eyrie over a sheer abyss , letting them flutter far earthward , swooping to save them just before they crashed , carrying them aloft to repeat the spartan experiment until they learned to fly . Representative Scrugham , a fairly New Dealish Democrat , was unopposed for renomination in last week 's primary , will fight it out in November with Republican Harry Stewart , former mayor of Reno . But the Senatorial race in his party brought to mind Mr. Scrugham 's eagle story . Young Albert Hilliard , Reno lawyer , tried his wings against roseate Old Senator Patrick Anthony McCarran , who was lightly marked for Purging because of his vote against the Court Bill . On his way through Nevada in July , Franklin Roosevelt encouraged the fledgling New Dealer by calling him " Brother Hilliard . " Last week young " Brother Hilliard " crashed to earth as old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCarran in November will run Republican Tasker Lowndes Oddie , old-time two-termer ( 1921-33 ) , whom Senator McCarran beat in landsliding 1932 by only 1,964 votes .
