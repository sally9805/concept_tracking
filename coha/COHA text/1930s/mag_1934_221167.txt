Last week President Roosevelt named as Governor of the Federal Reserve Board a onetime Republican who , eight days before Herbert Hoover left the White House , urged upon a Senate committee a recovery program which today can hardly be distinguished from the New Deal . Recommending big relief grants to the States , a $2,500,000,000 public works outlay , domestic allotment farm relief , high income and inheritance taxes , unification of the banking system and government regulation of the securities business , the witness smiled at the startled Senators and remarked : " I 'm a capitalist . " <P> That New Dealer was Marriner Stoddard Eccles , 44 , Utah banker who since last January has served Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau as a special assistant . Grandson of a covered-wagon pioneer , son of a rich &; pious Mormon , Governor Eccles graduated from Brigham Young College at 19 , promptly went to Scotland as a missionary . As if to allay fears of his Leftish theories , his business career was carefully itemized last week in a long White House release . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longtime head of a $50,000,000 group of Utah and Idaho banks " which came through the banking crisis in such splendid condition as to reflect great credit upon his ability as a bank executive " ; 2 ) president of a big construction company which got fat contracts at Boulder Dam and owns a 300,000-acre ranch with " 40,000 sheep and 25,000 cattle " ; 3 ) director of Pet Milk Co. ; 4 ) president of Sego Milk Products Co. ; 5 ) vice president &; treasurer of Amalgamated Sugar , a big Mormon beet-sugar enterprise ; 6 ) president of Stoddard Lumber Co. which cuts 30,000,000 ft. of timber annually , in eastern Oregon ; 7 ) director of a chain of lumber yards ; 8 ) director of a farm implement house . Said the White House release : " All of these concerns have successfully weathered the years of Depression . " <P> Governor Eccles is a thoroughgoing New Dealer who will do what President Roosevelt wants him to do . Yet when he was putting his ideas into the Congressional record nearly two years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may frighten those who possess wealth . How ever , they should feel reassured that it is to save the rich and not soak them . " <P> Last week Governor Eccles stepped to the stage front to pooh-pooh any radical impressions his Senate testimony may have created . " I have certainly , for instance , never advocated the redistribution of wealth , " he said . " That is perfectly impossible under the capitalistic system . "
