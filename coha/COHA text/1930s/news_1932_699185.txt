txt Chicago like other cities has seen its measure of recovery from the summer lows in the shape of better retail and wholesale trade , a slight upturn in employment and a pick up in the industries making consumers ' goods . For instance , August retail trade was 26% under the corresponding month last year , while September showed only about 20% under a year ago . The belief is that with sufficient push through advertising this will hold through October . Pleased as they are at these developments , business and financial leaders here are talking and thinking in terms of the long pull rather than in terms of this week or this month . Chicago looks westward to the farm belt where prices are at record lows and where foreclosures and forced sales drive land values clown and down . A sustained rise in wheat would oe a wonderful stimulant in this city . Also Chicago is a steel center . More than any other large city , its prosperity is directly linked with the prosperity of the railroads . The city 's financial condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Currently also are the disclosures in the Instill situation which are rendered certainly no less vivid by the fact that public officials connected with them are seeking return to office in November . Some of the City 's Problems All of this is not to paint the picture of a city beaten or despairing . On the contrary . Chicago seems in a sane and calm mood , ready to assess developments at their true value . A banker tells of plants which have shown a recent pick up . often seasonal , sometimes better . But he adds that he knows of scarcely a plant which could not produce 20 to 30% more with its present working force . This raises the pron. lem of increasing employment and stimulating buying power . From another source conic figures that Chicago is feeding 600,000 at a cost of *3,300,000 a month . The packing plants , which now are feeling the seasonal increase in the Southern demand for salted and cured meats , are looking to the financial results of their year which ends October 31 . For the smaller plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October business . some of the larger packers may not do so badly either . Then there are the farm implement makers and the mail order houses . Here one begins ? .. o see effects of a situation which , although in different terminology , is like that of the financial district a. short time ago when securities already depressed in price by vanishing corporation earnings were driven down still further by the forced liquidation of distressed holders . Depressed Farm Conditions Reflected Low farm prices have done more than cut the buying power of the rural population ; they have reduced the value of farm lands . Some of these farms are mortgaged for even more than 100% of their present value . At present prices the payment of interest on such a debt is next to impossible . There are arrears and foreclosvresThen a mortgage of more sound proportions may fall due . With land values already dropping from forced sales , renewals are extremely difficult to obtain. - There may be another foreclosure . The mortgage holder himself often is not in strong position . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further depresses land prices and the circle of capital deflation 25 under way . There have been discussions here , in the West and between these points and Washington of methods of refinancing farm mortgages . The Reconstruction Finance Corp . is understood to have talked with insurance companies and offered to take at 100% face value refinancing mortgages made on a sound basis . The companies are said to have felt that their appearance as R. F. C. borrowers might be misunderstood . a reflection of the Congressional action in insisting on publicity for rt . C. loans . The R. F. C. wants the joint stock land banks to be less pressing . The statement is made in this section that some of these bs , ars are press .. ing foreclosures and selling for what farms will bring to get funds to buy in their own bonds at present low levels . The discussion of mortgage refinancing still is under way . The ratio of what may be called distress farms to the total number of farms is small . The difficulty is that the sales of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are thus weakened . It is like the condition of a short time back when sale of a few bonds frequently had a depressing effect on a whole issue totaling millions . No one can tell when this cycle of farm liquidation will end any more than it could be predicted when security liquidation would end the distress phase . There are some indications that the course is nearly run and that farm lands are getting into strong hands . When that is done , the farm sections will be on a basis to rebuild from the shocks that first hit them 12 years ago . Competent tesimony is that land purchased at present level will yield a living and return on investment even at existing prices . When buildings and improvements are considered , farm lands have never been so cheap as now , not even in the homestead days of land at one dollar an acre , nor iiave terms been so easy . Another consideration is that something over 50% of the farms are mortgaged and of these many area on a very conservaive basis still . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living and come out with some cash even at present levels . - The farmer heavily in debt still has something to eat and a roof over his head . In the rural districts there is not the suffering from actual want that one finds in the large cities .
