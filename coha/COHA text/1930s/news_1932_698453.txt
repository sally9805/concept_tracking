txt The United States delegation to the general disarmament conference at Geneva will exercise a quiet but firm irole to facilitate an agreement among the nations which , if not productive of arms reduction , will lead to a treaty limiting armaments and paving the way for greater steps at a future conference . This outline of the aims of the United States at Geneva was given authoritatively today after the American delegation received its final instructions and Congress provided an initial appropriation of $450,000 for the expenses of the delegation . The final instructions were not made public , but it was made clear by administration spokesmen that the delegation will consider with an open mind every question on its merits , and be prepared to lend its good offices in the accommodation of differences among nations by urging them to solve their common political problems so the way might be prepared for an armament treaty . Aloof From Security Efforts . This policy of facilitating an understanding , it was asserted , would be confined to moral suasion on the part of the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the politics of Europe to the extent of joining in security pacts . This attitude , it was emphasized , was well understood by the other countries . Congressional action on the $450 , - 000 appropriation resolution was completed when the House adopted it by an overwhelming vote after a debate in which a group led by Representative Blanton , Democrat , of Texas , contended the Geneva conference would be futile , and sought unsuccessfully to reduce the amount to $200,000 . This move was defeated by a vote of 200 to 135 . The Senate passed the appropriation last Wednesday . It will be sent to the White House for the President 's signature tomorrow . Secretary Stimson said farewell today to Senator Swanson of Virginia and other members of the American delegation , who will sail on the Presi- dent Harding from New York on Wednesday . General Charles G. Dawes , chairman of the delegation . remained at the White House as the guest of President Hoover . Several of the advisers and technical aides to the delegation went to New York tonight preparatory to sailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congressional critics of the Geneva conference . the administration believes the conference will be one of the most important held in a long , time , and that even an agreement merely to limit armaments without reducing them would be productive of good because it would tend to eliminate national rivalries and pave the way for a future conference when real reduction might be achieved . The naval question has been largely settled , so far as the United States is concerned , by the Washington and London Treaties . Lend armies will be the primary issue at Geneva , and as the American Army is already on a skeleton basis it is expected the role of the American delegation will be largely one of assisting an agreement among the others . The problems at Geneva , it is felt , will concern other countries . Political and economic problems . it is believed , have contributed to the present armament competition . The administration does not anticipate that efforts will be made at Geneva to trade off reduction in intergovernmental debts for disarmament concessions . It was said today that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be considered by the United States here and not in Geneva , but the probability of such a trade was waved aside as rather remote . After General Dawes returns to this country late next month . Hugh S. Gibson , Ambassador to Belgium , will carry on as acting chairman , according to present plans , although a permanent chairman may be selected to sucece:i General Dawes before the conferecce is over . Mr. Gibson is thoroughly familiar with the problems and will be most active when technical phases of the deliberations are reached . Heated Debate in House . Consideration of the $450,000 appropriation resolution by the House was mat kqd by a heated debate between House groups which have been at odds on international affairs since the Hoover moratorium plan was presented . Led by Mr. Blanton and Representative , Republican . of Pennsylvania , one group insisted the Geneva conference would only involve the United States in European politics . Mr. Blanton maintained that much of the S450,000 would be used by the American delegates in having a " good time . " Representative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoover of having " sold out " the country in ne- ' gotiating the debt-holiday plan . de- I clared that what European governments want moist is to involve the United States in a discussion of intergovernmental debts and reparations . He attempted to amend the resolution to bar the American delegates from discussing the international debt problem . His motion was ruled out on a point of order raised by Representative La Guardia , Republican , of New York . Representatives Linthicum , Democrat , of Maryland , and Temple . Republican , of Pennsylvania . chairman and ranking Republican of the Foreign Affairs Committee , led the successful effort to put through the resolution substantially as recommended by the State Department . Representative Ruth Bryan Owen , Democrat , of Florida , daughter of William Jennings Bryan . and member of the Foreign Affairs Committee ; Representative Tilson of Connecticut , former Republican leader of the House . and Representative French , Republican , of Idaho . ranking minority member of the Subcommittee on Naval Appropriations , 9. nd Representative La Guardia spoke for the resolution . La Guardia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blackboard into the Chamber and , waving a pointer toward the House , said : " Let the House resolve itself into a class on simple arithmetic . Let 's see what we can find out about this resolution . With a crayon Mr. La Guardia jotted figures on the board . He put down the amounts to be appropriated this year for " war preparations " and payments for " past wars . " His table read : Cost of army and navy 5644.650.000 Upkeep veterans of former wars 926,000,000 Sinking . fund for public debt caused by last war 426.4 ? 9.600 sInterest on the public debt 640,000.000 This year 's part of new naval construction under Vinson bill 60.000,0011 Total s2,697,139,600 " And the $450,000 asked in this resolution is just 166 ten-thousandths of this amount we will have to pay this year as a result of war , " he shouted . " I say the conference is worth $450,000 : " Britten Sees Waste of Money . Representative Britten . Republican of Illinois , leader of the " Big Navy " group . said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sewer . " " That conference will go up in smoke , " declared Mr. Britten . " European nations are afraid of each other and rightly they should be . Let Europe hold its own conference . We belong on this side of the Atlantic and let 's stay here . " Opponents of the resolution made no attempt to register a roll-call vote on final passage of the resolution after the motion to reduce the appropriation to $200,000 was defeated .
