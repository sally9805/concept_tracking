He was third secretary at Stockholm , proceeded methodically to second secretary at Bucharest and , after spending three years in Washington as secretary in the Division of Western European Affairs , at the State Department , became first secretary at Berne . From 1927 to 1931 he headed the Division of Western European Affairs . In 1931 he was made counselor of the Embassy in Paris , soon became better known to U. S. travelers , including members of the Roosevelt family , than many members of the Embassy staff . In the meantime he had acquired a promising reputation by serving with special American delegations abroad and at one period was made charge d'affaires in Switzerland . Rumor had him slated for a minister 's post . Last year he went to Beirut , Syria for experience in the consular service .

S. When he applied for a visa , Consul General James Theodore Marriner approved it , had it mailed to Mejardich <P> Mr. Karayan forgot a forwarding address . <P> Karayan .
