" Whereas , in view of the acute financial emergency now existing in the City cf Detroit and throughout the State of Michigan , I deem it necessary in the public interest and for the preservation of the public peace , health and safety . . . . <P> " I hereby proclaim . . . Feb. 14. 1933 to Feb. 21 ... to be public holidays during which time all banks , trust companies and financial institutions within the State of Michigan shall not be opened . . . . " <P> Thus as had happened in Nevada last autumn , in Louisiana last fortnight , a banking moratorium was proclaimed this week in Michigan . It shut tight for eight days 530 banks with some $1,500,000,000 in deposits , was the biggest moratorium since the Depression . <P> Direct cause was the precarious position of Detroit 's $51,000,000 Union Guardian Trust Co. , potent unit of the $400,000,000 Guardian Group , brought on by heavy investments in real estate mortgages . On Monday night lights gleamed from the directors ' room on the seventh floor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conference hurriedly assembled . The Guardian clearly could not face another day . From Washington came Secretary of Commerce Roy Dikeman Chapin. a Detroit man . and Under Secretary of the Treasury Arthur Atwood Ballantine . Most of Detroit 's industrial and banking tycoons jammed the smoke-blue room . At 2 a. m . Governor Comstock announced simply that he would declare a holiday . Over the violent protest of the bankers , he told the " unvarnished story " of Union Guardian 's plight : <P> " Like other financial houses it Union Guardian has suffered depreciation of its assets and was seeking to get out of the banking business . ... To do so it would have to pay off depositors in cash and it did not have the funds available . . . . The company had already borrowed $15,000,000 from the R. F. C. and had asked for more . Representatives of the R. F. C. were in Detroit going over the assets and were prepared to loan an additional $23,000,000 . . . . This loan would have still left the Guardian about $2,000,000 short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . were General Motors Corp. , Chrysler Corp . and Ford Motor Co . Both G. M. C. and Chrysler had agreed to subordinate their deposits to the R. F. C. . . . and smaller depositors . The Ford company refused to make such an agreement and the result was the necessity of a moratorium . . . . Unless it had been declared , the larger depositors who were informed in advance would have withdrawn their money and left the smaller ones ' holding the bag ' . ... I understand that the deposit of the Ford company . . . was about $7,500,000 . . . . " <P> The Detroit Stock Exchange closed during the day . Outside trading of bank stocks was banned . On the New York exchanges both stocks and bonds slumped sharply . Meantime throughout Michigan plans were rushed to permit withdrawals for household accounts and payrolls . General modification of the " holiday " ' was envisaged . <P> More immediate modification of another sort took place next day when Governor Comstock retracted his charges against the Ford company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
