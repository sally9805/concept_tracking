Students at New York 's City College have become accustomed to discovering that their pompous college officials have feet of clay . Four years ago they tittered when their president , bland Dr. Frederick B. Robinson , wrote an article for Bernarr Macfadden 's sensational True Story Magazine . Last week City College 's students caught another member of the administration in an embarrassing position . <P> Students in the College 's School of Business and Civic Administration have no great love for its dictatorial dean , Dr. Justin H. Moore . In 1934 he suppressed an April Fool issue of The Ticker , student weekly , for " obscenity . " He once censored the Monthly , has suspended editors for sauciness . Last week student editors learned that in 1934 Dean Moore wrote a book called Mexican Love , hitherto unknown to U. S. readers because it was published in London by Herbert Jenkins , Ltd. , publishers of popular fiction . <P> City College 's student publications thereupon published belated reviews of this book . Chapter titles : " A Platonic Kiss , " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Its big scene : a nude woman , lying on a couch of black velvet , seducing the hero : " ' You hold yourself in control like a bloodhound in leash , ' she said with a provocative movement of her lips . . . . Flushed , panting , in a frenzy of passion , she clung to him , kissing him with avid lips , aroused to wild lubricity . ' Beat me if you like , ' she cried , ' strike me , crush me . I crave violence . ' " <P> Violent were the guffaws on City College 's campus when Dr. Moore 's work was reviewed last week . One student publication reported that U. S. Postal authorities had threatened to bar it from the mails if it printed a story containing excerpts from the book , and that John S. Sumner , head of the N. Y. Society for the Suppression of Vice , had denounced Mexican Love . <P> Meanwhile , successive editions of the Manhattan press printed fresh explanations by Dean Moore . Said he : " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's on Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer 's preferred list . . . . It 's a sugar-coated study of a social scene . . . . When you write a book for young people , that is , for the general public , you like to make the titles rather interesting . "
