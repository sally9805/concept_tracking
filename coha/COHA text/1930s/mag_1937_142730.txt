To Congress and the public President Roosevelt last week gave the evidence which had caused him to release a blast at wealthy tax-dodgers ( TIME , June 7 ) . It was in the form of a 3,000 word letter from Secretary Morgenthau and amounted to a short course in the art of tax-dodging as perfected by high-priced lawyers . <P> Bill of Particulars . Mr. Morgenthau listed eight kinds of tax-dodging , all of which he classed as " moral fraud " : 1 ) setting up personal holding companies in the Bahamas , Panama , Newfoundland and other places from which tax money can not be extradited ; 2 ) buying one-payment life insurance ( from a Bahama company ) , borrowing back the " payment " and claiming tax deductions for interest paid on the loan ; * 3 ) establishing personal holding companies in the U. S. , which in spite of special taxes still pays those who are rich enough ; 4 ) incorporating yachts , town houses , country estates , racing stables so that their operating losses can be claimed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding companies so as to claim the interest as an income deduction ; 6 ) creating trusts for wife , children and relatives so as to divide family income and keep it out of the highest surtax brackets ; 7 ) taking wives and children into partnership for the same purpose ; 8 ) creating pension trusts , which pay reduced taxes , for the benefit not of ordinary employes but of a few high officers of a company . To these dodges Mr. Morgenthau added three others " which the law itself permits " : 1 ) claims for depletion by oil and mining companies , which are allowed as a deduction from income and prevent the Treasury from collecting up to $75,000,000 a year ; 2 ) dividing a husband 's income with his wife in tax returns from the eight States which have community property laws , + thereby reducing individual surtaxes ; 3 ) the flat tax of 10% on U. S. income of nonresident aliens , imposed by the revenue law of 1936 . This reduced the tax on the $300,000 income of an American-born woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Morals . Said the President : <P> " Mr. Justice Holmes said , ' Taxes are what we pay for civilized society . ' Too many individuals , however , want the civilization at a discount . . . . <P> " A feeling of indignation on reading this letter will , I am confident , be yours , as it was mine . . . . <P> " Very definitely , the issue immediately before us is the single one relating to the evasion or unethical avoidance of existing laws . . . . Already efforts to befog this issue appear . Already certain newspaper publishers are seeking to make it appear- first , that if an individual can devise unanticipated methods to avoid taxes which the Congress intended him to pay , he is doing nothing unpatriotic or unethical ; and second , that because certain individuals do not approve of high income-tax brackets , or the undistributed earnings tax , or the capital gains tax , the first duty of the Congress should be the repeal or reduction of those taxes . In other words , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . <P> " The decency of American morals is involved . The example of successful tax-dodging by a minority of very rich individuals breeds efforts by other people to dodge other laws . . . . "
