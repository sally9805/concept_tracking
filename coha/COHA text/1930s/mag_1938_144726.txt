For nine years , Publisher Samuel Emory Thomason of Chicago 's tabloid Daily Times ( p.m. ) was Vice-President and Business Manager of the Chicago Tribune ( a.m. ) , published by his Northwestern Law School classmate and former law partner , Robert Rutherford McCormick . The Daily Times is the closest imitation in U. S. journalism of New York 's tabloid Daily News , published by ' ' Bertie ' ' Mc-Cormick 's cousin , Joseph Medill Patterson. * The Chicago Times , like the New York Daily News , is a gay and vigorous supporter of the New Deal . Nothing delights the Times more than baiting solemn Colonel McCormick 's morbidly anti-New Deal Tribune , self-styled " The World 's Greatest Newspaper . " During the 1936 Presidential campaign , the Tribune each morning grimly tolled off the number of days remaining in which ' ' to save your country " at the polls . On election " day , the Times , only important Chicago daily supporting Roosevelt , impudently ridiculed the Tribune ' ? , predictions of doom with a gigantic front-page headline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Classmate Bertie demonstrated last week that he still had the old school spirit . Early one morning , a fire started among the newsprint rolls in the basement of the Times plant , crippling the presses . Promptly , the Tribune offered its presses . Promptly , the Times accepted the Tribune ' ' ? , " good neighbor " offer and , missing but one edition , managed to run off 250,000 of its normal 380,000 daily print order . Fun-loving Times Managing Editor Louis Ruppel , onetime Washington correspondent of the New York Daily News , put a picture of his smoking plant on the front page with a series of wisecracking banner headlines for his " Fire Editions . " The headlines : <P> ARE WE BURNED UP ! <P> HOT OFF THE PRESS ! ( The Tribune 's ) <P> FIRE IS OUT , SO IS TIMES <P> By week 's end , the Times was printing most of its full run on its own presses , the rest on the Tribune 's . <P> <P> * The nineteen-year-old Daily News , 1,738,667 daily and 3,233,407 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. In a modest way , Publisher Thomason has also emulated this kind of success . In four years , the Times 's circulation has grown from 152,813 to 349,855 , passing Hearst 's morning Herald &; Examiner and lacking about 80,000 to equal Hearst 's evening American and Colonel Frank Knox 's evening News . The Tribune , with a daily circulation of over 825,000 , remains Chicago 's biggest paper .
