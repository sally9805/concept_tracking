In 1831 , a few months before the first meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science , David Brewster wrote to John Phillips : " The principal object of the Society would be to make the cultivators of science acquainted with each other , to stimulate one another to new exertions , and to bring the objects of science more before the public eye , and to take measures for advancing its interests and accelerating its progress . " <P> Last week in Nottingham , Sir Edward Bagnall Poulton , D. Sc. , LL . D. , F. R. S. , distinguished zoology professor at Oxford , this year 's president of the B. A. A. S. , said : " The British Association provides a very favorable field for the discussion of many-sided subjects . . . . " <P> British scientists as a class are less afraid of their colleagues ' opinion than U. S. scientists , and at their meetings they adhere less to the orthodox line of matter-of-fact reporting . In his presidential address Sir Edward , who is 81 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has been going to B. A. A. S. meetings for 56 years and he remembers the shifting course of B. A. A. S. opinion about organic evolution . That was what he talked about last week . <P> There still exists a good deal of controversy about how evolution works , but even old Sir Edward can not remember back to the time when the evolution process itself was attacked by reputable scientists . However , smoke from the old battle of Lamarckism v. Natural Selection has not yet finally cleared . Lamarckism is the theory that acquired characteristics can be inherited , that some profit from experience can be passed on to succeeding generations as a sort of protoplasmal memory . Natural Selection holds that accidental variations which happen to be favorable to the organism will be preserved by the survival of the fittest . Lamarckism is in general disrepute for the simple reason that evidence for it is scanty and dubious . The grosser physical aspects of it have long been disproved , notably by the classic experiment of Weismann who cut off the tails of generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being born with full-length tails . But a few Lamarckists still insist that imponderables like acquired habits and tendencies can be inherited . <P> Last week Dr. Poulton brought into court certain characteristics which could not possibly have been developed by inherited experience , since the experience in question is fatal . Example : protective coloring in insects . If the coloring is defective and the insect is detected and devoured by preying birds , it can not profit by the experience of being eaten or pass on any profit to any offspring . Only alternative is the neo-Darwinist conclusion that the insects which happen to have the most protective coloring will live longest and pass on their advantages to large numbers of offspring .
