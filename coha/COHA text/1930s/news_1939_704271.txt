txt Press Conference was all over yesterday but President Roosevelt called it back , holding aloft a small mechanical gadget over which he appeared to be as happy as a boy . Asking if reporters could remember the old cyclometer that used to record mileage on bicycles , President Roosevelt proudly explained that this new contrivance worked after the same fashion , to measure the electricity used in a small house . And instead of costing $10.00 which is what the big meter costs , this new one would cost about halt that . Mr. Roosevelt was so pleased with it that he held it aloft from his swivel chair all the time he talked about it , so that the circle This was n't the whole story either , for Mr. Roosevelt explained that a system is being worked out for letting farmers read their own meters ! This sounded Utopian , until he added that every six months the REA , or the local power company or whoever was selling the power would send around its own checkers to examine results . In other words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semi-annual checkings , with the monthly checkings made by consumers themselves . The cost of meter readings and of sending out bills under such a system , he declared would be reduced from an average of 15 cents to 3 cents a month . The Press Conference was pleased and filed out leaving the President still looking affectionately at the gadget on his big desk .
