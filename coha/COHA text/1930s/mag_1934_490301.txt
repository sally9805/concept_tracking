Notes and Comment I ENTEN NOTE : Among the books chosen by the Syracuse Public Library for its shelf marked " Devotional Reading for Lent " is Clarence Day 's " God and My Father . " STURM-UND-DRANG NOTE : During the recent blizzard , a notice was posted on the outgoing train board in the Grand Central : " 1 1 A.M. train annulled . Passengers will take 12 o'clock train , " WE encountered a writer this week who wanted our advice . He wanted to know whether he should give up his job teaching school and move to town , where he could meet other writers . " What do you want to inert other writers for ? " we asked sharply . And he did n't know . " If you just want to know how they look , " we continued , " they look terrible , particularly in the late evening in groups of three to seven , or in the morning singly . If you want to know what they talk about , they talk about themselves and the things they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his useful work of teaching school and writing , 19- safe for a few months more , anyway , from the demoralizing effects of mingling with his craft . AFTER he had gone , we sat here wondering whether we had been justified in advising a writer to stay away from writers . The longer we pondered the matter , the surer we felt of our ground . In each other 's com-pany , writers tend to magnify the sig-nificance and difficulty- of writing and to destroy its essential simplicity and directness . They also act up more than is necessary to preserve the tradition of temperament . The breakage is very high . In clusters , writers lack that nobleness and grace of character from which come nobleness and grace in art . They ruin tablecloths with lead pencils . Jealous as pigeons , they knife each other in the hack and are sorry the next day . We doubt if the total output of writers , good and had , justifies the enormous fuss and clatter they make out of the business of literature . Another reason for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the tactics of the procurers . An overwhelming number of all books , plays , articles , reviews , stories , poems , and pamphlets that are written in the course of a year originate not as the result of the author 's urgency but of somebody else 's persuasion or direction . The vestibule of the Muse is packed with solicitors . It seems to us that the great restlessness of publishers , agents , and idea men is degrading and a too great drain on the reservoirs of creation . Anybody who can spell is sought after these days by middlemen holding out sugar cookies . OF course , mixing with literary peo- ple has its amusement value . Certainly there is no sight more engrossing than that of a writer getting ready to write something . We have known several writers who spent virtually their whole Lives trying to get themselves into position to create . Something was always wrong : either they needed fewer people about , or they needed more people about , or a room higher up from the earth , or a room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't write because the passion was too absorbing ; if they were out of love , their pen stood still for want of love 's urging . One writer once told us he had to be " right down on the ground where he could touch it " before he could create . We have always been mildly jealous of persons of this sort , who find in preparation for work a pleasant substitute for work itself , and whose whole skill is in making sun , moon , and stars conspire for one perfect moment of literary labor . APORTUGUESE paper , Mario dr Noticias , published in Lisbon , carried the most competent account of the Welfare Island raid . Perhaps it would he permissible to quote the first paragraph , translating as we go along : New YORK , January 26 . ? The discovery the day before yesterday of the great scandal of the Welfare Island prison excited the public opinion over the fact to know that , practically , this penal institution has been governed by two " gangsters " in company with police agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most illustrious in New York , and who lived there up to the date of the last civic elections . Somehow this idea of Tammany Hall as a notorious woman ( a brunette with flashing eyes , probably ) is attractive to us . It would he decidedly more picturesque to have the city in the hands of a ravishing and wily female than merely a prey to some ambitious old Democrats . E recommend for your delecta-tion and dismay the article by Stuart Chase in Scribner 's for March . It is the most legible thing we have read on the metaphysics of ownership , the moonbeams of presumptive future earnings . Great matters such as the control of corporate wealth arc not things we have ever been privy to ; these mysteries , these architectures , are not for the little man of destiny . So it is stirring to discover , at this rather late date , that the holders of stock in many corporate enterprises have been a good deal like passengers in a train operated , not manually by an engineer , but remotely by persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn thing . Or at least by throwing it frequently off schedule . It occurs to us that enough is now known of the higher twiddling of corporations to make it compulsory that certain kinds of stock certificates carry , in italics , the following explanatory note or reminder : " The purchaser of this share in our business should bear in mind that the corporation , though operated for profit , is controlled for despoliation . May we remind you , as you come into the fold , that though the directors want things to go well , behind them are the far hunters who will see to it that things go erratically , even go bust ? God bless you , little man , and keep you safe ! " Crazy to Write ONE of our Washington men spent a recent rainy afternoon nosing around the Library of Congress and made an interesting find on Deck 43 . There is stacked an assortment of volumes known as the X Collection . The legend is that it contains books written , in the supposition of the librarians , by lunatics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tender Buttons , " by Gertrude Steinea published in 1914 ; it bears the Library of Congress catalogue number X3873 . Right next to it on the shelf is a copy of a book called " Making a Medium , " by one W. E. Stanton , the title page of which bears this printed legend : " Below ? Handwriting of God , " followed by this , in script : " It is my Will that this little book shall be translated throughout all the Earth . God the Father . " Our man dipped into only two or three more of the volumes . He began to feel kind of queer and went on to the Eugene Field shelf . Life of a Star A DOLOROUS knight , returned from the Hollywood wars , dropped in to see us and told us about a conversation he overheard between Gloria Swanson and a young movie director . The director explained to the radiant lady that his three principal interests were really fishing , Airedale dogs , and Staffordshire pottery . " I have only one hobby myself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a queen . " Which reminded us of the enchanting story of what once happened to Gloria Swanson and her former husband , the Marquis de la Falaise dc la Coudraye , here in our city . It was on the occasion of their first triumphal entry into New York as Marquis and Marquise . They attended , shortly after arriving , a concert in Carnegie Hall , and they sat like two gleaming jewels in the midst of the assemblage of less glamorous people . Both were handsomely gowned ( the Marquis was , of course , not exactly " gowned , " but probably some of the plainer and blunter husbands in the audience thought of him as " gowned " ) . Anyway , there they sat , with all eyes dressed upon them . Shortly before the intermission two gentlemen , friends of Miss Swanson and notorious wags , the Messrs . James Creelman and Sport , Ward , slipped out of the auditorium and returned at the start of the intermission , each bearing two chocolate ice-cream cones . They walked impressively down the aisle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could until they were directly upon the innocent pair . Then , with quick , low , simultaneous bows , they solemnly extended their offerings , Mr. Creelman handing his two cones to the Marquis and Mr. Ward presenting his to Miss Swanson . Automatically , without thinking , the two victims accepted the little tokens , and there they sat , each of them holding two ice-cream cones , one in one hand and one in the other . This situation , like certain holds in wrestling , is difficult to get out of . As a matter of fact , the Marquis and the Marquise did not , for a long time , get out of it . They just sat there , holding their cones . Miss Swanson by this time was " on to " the fact that the thing was a spoof , an 7l-timed , slowly melting spoof ; the Marquis , however , thought for a while that the presentation was simply an old American custom . They were saved , in a way , by the return to the stage of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strayed from the couple for a moment , and in this interval , after a hurried whispered consultation , the lovely lady and her bridegroom put their four cones on the floor under their seats . 6 St. Luke 's Place Timmy WALKER 'S house in St. Luke 's J Place , now owned by a gentleman who deals in essential oils , was a fashionable dwelling in Civil War days . It was one of a row of houses built by William S. Vanderbilt , and it was still fashionable when Jimmy , age seven , went to live in it with his father and mother . The present owner , Mr. Eric Coupey , kindly allowed us to roam with him through the place the other day , making notes on our cuff and looking for Hattie Carnegie in the dumb-waiter , The house is , of course , empty and forlorn , save for a room on the third floor front which used to be Jimmy 's study and which now contains a couple of essential-oil clerks busily sending cables . The plaster walls in the downstairs hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dismal as death . Following our guide up uncarpeted steps , we explored , in a spirit of reverence , Jimmy 's bedroom , third floor rear . The carpet was gone , but a bleak four-poster remained , lumpy with a gray mattress ; also an excessively dingy chaise-longue minus its upholstery . The only traces of the Mayor were a leather belt hanging lonely in a closet and a bag containing five or six dozen collars in a startling variety of hues and designs , Walkerian to the last dot . Mr. Coupey intends to preserve these , in case Mr. Walker should ever drop in . On the top floor was Mrs. Walker 's bedroom , which still bristles with twenty-one shoe racks . Under a window was a mysterious switch , which Mr. Coupey is having the Edison Company trace to its source . The whole house , in fact , seems to have been amply wired ? with an inter-room phone system and a special device by which the Mayor was able to change circuits when he suspected that the enemy was tapping his wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a green Victrola , yellowing copy of " Will You Love Me in December as You Do in May ? , " and , face down under a battered desk , a large drawing of Cardinal Hayes , signed by him . Drawings and photographs of Jimmy also littered this room , which was apparently used as a catchall during the inoving-out process a year ago . There were various old bills from markets and shops , and an illuminated scroll in Spanish made out to Sr Alcalde de la Municipalidad de New-York . " I 'm going to have it framed , " said Mr. Coupey , thoughtfully . With the aid of a flashlight , we invaded the cellar , where a couple of men from the Phone Company were trying to pry the lock off the switch-hoard , unsuccessfully . Two built-in wine cellars were full of dust and old newspapers and old , faded deck-chairs . In one corner was the Mayor 's fishing tackle . In the laundry we paused for one hallowed moment in front of the ironing board on which the celebrated creases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some paintings in this room  --  oils of Jimmy 's father , his mother , his first wife , and one of Christ . Houses that people have gone from are very sad places . Mr. Coupey intends to use the house as part home , part office . He and his wife and two children were to move in shortly . He told us that essential oils are lemon oil , orange oil , geranium oil , jasmine oil , and about fifty other oils , derived in the main from fruits and flowers and made in Japan , Greece , Java , and wherenot . Castor oil is not essential . Bad Mans WE are told , a little late , about the alarming experience of a young lady from Tennessee who got to town during the taxi strike . It was her first unchaperoned visit to the great city , and she came laden with parental advice and admonitions . Among other things she was never , under any circumstances , to ride alone in a taxicab after dark . The young lady stayed out of cabs until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be less terrifying to get into one than ride the subway again . She hailed an empty taxi somewhere in the West Forties . " Can Ah have this cab ? " she asked . " Why sure , lady , " said the driver , " if you want to take the risk , but you may get a brick in your face , " " My God , " thought the young lady , " Mamma was right ! " She fled . Big Boy TAST spring we made a resolve that ' I during this theatrical season we would write up Al Goodman , a man who has had a hand in more musical shows than anybody else , yet who never gained much fame with the public . Of course , he has quit the theatre and gone radio , but we will tell you about him anyhow , on the ground that his memory is still green . There is , or was , nobody quite like him . A native of Russia , able to sing grand-opera arias in a nice alto when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just out of his teens , and has been at it ever since . He is forty-three now . During a period of a few weeks in the 1926-27 season , there were nine musical shows running simultaneously with Goodman-trained orchestras . It was Goodman 's custom to organize an orchestra and then stick with it only through the out-of-town trials and the first week or two of the Broadway run . Then he 'd turn the baton over to another conductor . He get five hundred dollars a week , they say , more than twice as much as an ordinary leader , and he brought into New York a hundred and fifty musical shows ( to a hair , he says ) . Everything went as smooth as sealskin with Al conducting , but sometimes his departure demoralized the show for a time . Once , in 1927 , two French dancers , Roserav and Capella , simply could n't get along under the baton of Goodman 's successor in a revue Goodman had " set . " So every night he had to leave another show he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct for them . When the revue went to Chicago , Goodman conducted the opening night there . The next night , without him , Capella dropped Roseray and she suffered a fractured skull . When " Big Boy " was running at the Winter Garden , it was a conceit of Al Jolson 's to stop the show every now and then and ask " Is Al here ! ' " He was n't , of course  --  he was over at the Century , starting off " The Prisoner of Zenda " or something  --  hut they 'd send For him and he 'd rush over and lead the orchestra for a few Jolson . songs . Sometimes he conducted in his shirtsleeves . The audience and both Als liked this . Jolson was really the discoverer of Goodman . He found him conducting " So Long Lefty " on the Pacific Coast and took him out of that into " Sinbad , " " Bombo , " and " Big Boy " ( the three Jolson shows that ran a total of nine years ) . Goodman also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of his great admirers is Morris Gest , who always went down the aisle after an opening night , patted Goodman on the shoulder , and said , " The best yet . " Last spring , after Goodman 's first broadcast , the phone rang in the studio . It was Gest for Mr. Goodman . " The best yet , " said Gest . Goodman conducted the orchestras in the Irvin Cobb and Jack Pearl programs late hut year , and then left for a long vacation in Miami . He 's hack now to handle the music for George M. Cohan 's broadcasts . Immediately the opera season is over , he is going to lead a fifty-piece orchestra on a " variety " program Lucky Strike is planning . Goodman 's father , a cantor , began teaching his boy music when he was seven . At twelve he won a scholarship in the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore , singing to the surprised judges a difficult aria from " Faust . " One of his fellow-pupils was John Charles Thomas . After he graduated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played the piano in theatres here and there . Then he got a job rehearsing the Milton Aborn Company 's orchestra , and shortly after that went to the Coast . Since then he has directed for every producer and every dancing and singing star there is , or darn near . Endorsement DOWN from Buffalo conies an incident that happened in a kink there , when a woman came in to cash a check that had been made out to her by her husband . The teller said she would have to endorse it , but she did n't seem to understand . He told her just to sign her name on the back . But her husband had already signed it , and right on the front , she said . The teller took a deep breath and explained that her signature on the back would he a receipt for the money , would show her husband that she had got the money all right . With a smile of enlightenment , she went to the desk , scribbled away , and finally handed the check in , triumphantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Redder IF you are going to have plenty of spare time for a while , you might try reading the Encyclopredia Britannica , starting at " A " in Vol. 1 and winding up with " Zygote , " Vol. 23 . If you complete the whole thing in less than four years and a half , let us know , for you 'll have broken the record now held by the only person we know of who has ever accomplished the feat in any number of years . His name  --  and you can wash our mouth out with soap if you think we 're fib- bing is Shirk . A. Urban Shirk is the complete name . Mr. Shirk is not a professional reader , but a businessman with offices at 90 Vest Street and a home in Little Neck . He directs the sales and advertising of the International Products Corporation . He reads the EncyclopRdia because he likes it and because he thinks it makes him a better businessman . It was the eleventh edition of the Encyclopmdia that Mr. Shirk went through in four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him longer than that to finish the fourteenth edition , which he has now got well started on  --  being , as we go to press with our puny paragraphs , nearly halfway through Vol. 4 ( BRAT to CAST ) . He does n't skip around . He opens Vol. 1 to " A , " reads all about this first letter in our alphabet , and then goes to " Al AT LLOYD 'S " ( popular expression denoting super-excellence ) , " AA " ( name of many small European rivers ) , " AABENRAA " ( town in Denmark ) , and so on , taking each subject in its order and omitting none . Mr. Shirk finds some of the mathematical and scientific stuff tough going , but much easier to read in the fourteenth edition than in the eleventh . He finds the fourteenth , so far as he has gone , a big improvement on the eleventh generally . Ile has made no specific comparisons between the two , but his impression is that most of the material was completely rewritten . Mr. Shirk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history during the World War , and started to read ' Williams 's twenty-four-volume " Historians ' History of the World . " It took him two years . Among his other feats of methodical reading are an eighteen-volume set of Dumas ( read twice ) , it thirty-two-volume set of Bedzac ( twice ) , and a twenty-volume set of Dickens ( three times ) . lie does n't think much of the Five-Foot Shelf or of the fifteen-minutes-a-day idea . Ordinarily , he reads about three hours every night , although not always the Britannica . He may dig into Balzac , his favorite writer of fiction , or read a contemporary hook . It has taken him from two to six months on each of the volumes of the new edition of the Britannica . He jots down in each the date he starts it and the date he finishes . He usually takes a volume along on business trips  --  something to read on the train . He never reads the Britannica while commuting , however ; only the newspapers , or a novel . Mr. Shirk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hit ( water colors ) and collects gramophone records . He has twelve complete operas . He has asked us to Little Neck to hear them some time , played alphabetically . Diffident FROM Boston to Portsmouth the train went through a place called Breakfast Hill . %Ve noticed the conductor cooling through the car , stopping at each seat and asking something in a low voice . Soon it was our turn . He bent over and whispered , " Are you getting off at Breakfast Hill ? " " No , " we hissed . " Why ? " " Because if you are getting off there , the next station is it . " " But this secrecy ! " we whispered . " What 's up ? " The conductor then told us his story ? that he was no longer able to call out the name of Breakfast Hill , because it made him feel silly . " I used to do it , " he said , " but I ca n't any more . "
