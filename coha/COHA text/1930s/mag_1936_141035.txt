Britain 's Will H. Hays is a distinguished old peer named William George Tyrrell . Like his U. S. counterpart , Baron Tyrrell of Avon , onetime British Ambassador to France , has no governmental standing but , as salaried ( $10,000 ) president of the Board of Film Censors , a creation of the British film industry , he takes public responsibility for that organization 's acts . Actual work he leaves mostly to a professional Cato , one J. Brooke Wilkinson , who works on the principle that any footage controversial enough to ruffle the customary calm of a cinema audience should be deleted . <P> Censor Wilkinson has had his troubles with the March of Time from its inception . Overruling the March of Time 's claim that , as journalism in celluloid , it must be as free to handle controversial news as the Press , Watchdog Wilkinson has on various occasions removed from the British March of Time shots of German Nazis persecuting Jews , members of the French People 's Front demonstrating against the Fascist Croix de Feu.     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
