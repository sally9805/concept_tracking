Tears are constantly secreted by glands which get their water from the blood and lie just above the outer curve of each eyeball . Tears float slowly over the eyeballs and drain into the nose and throat through two holes at the inner corner of each eye . Ordinarily this flow &; drainage of tears is imperceptible , and serves simply to keep the eyeballs clean and slippery . But dirt or stinging stuff in the eyes makes those glandular reservoirs suddenly empty in a protective local reflex . The excess causes weeping , sniffling and gulping , for hard crying produces more tears than the tear ducts can carry off , and the excess overflows the lower eyelids onto the cheeks .

The possibility of the production of sinusitis and otitis media secondary to irritation by chloroacetophenone commonest tear gas is not at all fantastic . Chloroacetophenone is not the practically harmless substance it is commonly reputed to be . " <P> Dr. William D. McNally , University of Chicago toxicologist and lieutenant-colonel of the Chemical Warfare Reserve Corps , recommends a 0.4% solution of sodium sulphite in a mixture of 75% glycerin and 25% water as an antidote for tear gas in the eyes .
