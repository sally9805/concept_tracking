For 100 years the indigent aged who live in New York City 's municipal poor houses on Staten and Welfare Islands , have been issued standard raiment . In a century it has grown almost as quaint as the outfits of Beefeaters in London 's Tower . For men it consists of high shoes with elastic inserts like Congress gaiters and cotton suits whose intrinsic shapelessness is a true reflection of the style of nightshirt in which they have to sleep . For women it consists of coarse cotton mother hubbards , black cotton stockings , shoes like the men 's , floppy sunbonnets . To both sexes the official dress gives an air of covered wagon days , and to the city 's present 3,175 old paupers , who daily look across from their island homes to the skyscrapers of Manhattan , it is a sore trial . <P> Last week there was jubilation in the city 's poorhouses . The Department of Hospitals announced that henceforth paupers will have a choice of nightshirts or pajamas , suits cut like tailors ' advertisements and shrink-proof , shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt hats for winter , straws for summer , stockings still cotton but in stylish tan . As a special treat , garters will be issued to both sexes . Reason : the city discovered that the paupers ' clothes were so old-fashioned they had to be made to order ; it will be cheaper to buy modern clothes from stock .
