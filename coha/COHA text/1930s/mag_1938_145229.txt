The reason for Japan 's invasion of China is that Japan wants not only all of China 's raw materials but all of her markets . One of the things that China produces is opium poppies . One of the things China buys is narcotics which are made from opium poppies . This is accepted as an ideal situation by the Japanese , who have made an enormous profit briskly boosting both ends of the dope trade . <P> According to a report given last summer to the League of Nations Committee on Traffic in Opium , Japan 's main supply of opium , which she sold under Japanese Army supervision to the Chinese , was imported from Iran ( TIME , June 27 ) . That report is now out of date . The bustling Japanese now produce most of China 's narcotics in Japanese factories in Manchukuo , route the supply down from Dairen to Shanghai and Nanking . <P> Latest word on Japan 's profitable dope traffic came last week from Dr. Miner Searle Bates , vice president of the U. S.-supported University of Nanking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had personally made , Dr. Bates declared : <P> &gt;In Nanking 50,000 persons , one-eighth of the population , are being slowly poisoned by heroin ( an opium product ) sold by Japanese-directed rings . <P> &gt;At least 5,000,000 Chinese dollars are made every month in the Nanking area by dealers belonging to or allied with the Japanese Army . Out of this , Japan 's puppet Chinese " Reformed " Government gets a sizable cut . <P> &gt;Japanese and Korean prostitutes " attached " to the Japanese Army fortnight ago brought into Nanking 80 cases of opium . <P> &gt;Japanese agents three weeks ago delivered 400 cases of Iranian opium to Nanking 's Opium Suppression Bureau , which ostensibly was set up to curb the traffic but which actually distributes opium through its own sales agencies .
