<P> After reading 80 angry letters of protest , William J. Egan , director of Public Safety in Newark , N. J. , last week told Sidney Franklin ( Frumkin ) , Brooklyn toreador , that he could not hold a bullfight in New Jersey . Toreador Franklin had planned one for next week . He wanted to show U. S. citizens how he did it in Spain . He promised that it would be a gentle fight . He planned to use a rubber sword , pad the bull 's horns . He said he would wave his cape and let the bull run at him . But not unless it was absolutely necessary would the bull be harmed . <P> When Minnie Maddern Fiske , animal-loving actress , read about the fight she was in New Haven lecturing to Yale students . Instead of telling them about modern drama she urged them to write letters of protest to New Jersey authorities . Many gallantly complied , including Professor William Lyon Phelps . Other letters came from President Jonn Grier Hibben of Princeton University ; the Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Humane Society of New York , the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals . <P> When Mrs. Fiske heard about Director Egan 's decision she said : " My compliments to Mr. Egan and the Mayor . The people of the world will be informed that the United States will not even tolerate a burlesque bullfight . " <P> Retorted Toreador Franklin : " The idea that bullfights are cruel comes from cheap literature and hearsay . "
