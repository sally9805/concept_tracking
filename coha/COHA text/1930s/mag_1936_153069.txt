Hot but happy was Topeka , Kans. last week as it turned out to salute John Daniel Miller Hamilton , returning from Cleveland to hand the Republican nomination to Governor Alfred Mossman Landon and to plan with him how their glowing prize may be converted into the U. S. Presidency . Co-Candidate Knox reported in Topeka , too , and , after an appropriate amount of hat-waving and handshaking , John Hamilton , with characteristic snap and simplicity , lined up an executive campaign committee . Included were such new faces as Congressman Joseph W. Martin Jr . of Massachusetts , Earl Warren of California , Robert P. Burroughs of New Hampshire , Ezra R. Whitla of Idaho- such old faces as Charles Dewey Hilles of New York , Harrison Spangler of Iowa , Rentfro Banton Creager of Texas , " RedHeaded Rooster of the Rio Grande . " <P> Figures unfamiliar to Kansans began to appear in Topeka 's streets : Charles P. Taft , younger brother of Ohio 's favorite son , Robert Taft , come to help Governor Landon prepare speeches ; Charlton MacVeagh of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offshoots of conservative families ; Ralph West Robey of Columbia to advise on economics ; Earl H. Taylor , formerly of The Country Gentleman , to advise on farm problems ; E. Ross Bartley , onetime secretary to Vice President Charles G. Dawes , later press-agent of Chicago 's Century of Progress , to take charge of Nominee Landon 's press relations . <P> John Hamilton quickly made plain that this " Brain Trust " would have little to do with the campaign .

In early autumn while Nominee Landon is relatively quiescent , Co-Nominee Knox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But for the early part of the campaign the major burden would be thrown on G.O.P. Chairman Hamilton . His virile features and straightforward talk would be offered the U. S. as a contrast to Democratic Chairman Farley . Trusting to his physical stamina , he would be pushed unceasingly , would fly from state to state , cover the country from coast to coast , make two , three , four speeches daily . <P> Burden-Bearer . Easily the most newsworthy product of the Cleveland convention was John Hamilton , his youthful looks , engaging smile , curly chestnut head , frank manner , direct speech . To bored political onlookers , not Alf Landon but John Hamilton was the young Lochinvar come out of the West .
