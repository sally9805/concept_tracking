ALL THE HONORS A STORY BY GORDON ARTHUR SMITH S OENATOR DACIER lay motionless in the bed and listened to his nurse , Miss Thornton , who was energetically cleaning up the room . She made no more noise than usual , but when she lifted and replaced an object she did it with a finality that always reminded the Senator of the last stroke of a hammer . Why , he wondered , why should she feel compelled to clink so many glass bottles against plate glass table-tops . She probably was not aware , for he had been either too proud or too patient to tell her , that every slightest noise made his heart jump . Oh , of course , she never by any chance made any good loud noise  --  she knew her business better than to do that  --  but the succession of little crystal and metallic clinkings was even more nerve-racking . The Senator felt really too exhausted to remonstrate . He knew that he was going to die before very long , anyhow . Something or other followed by something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , most unfortunately , they found that his heart was in a grave condition . Well , that last he knew without being told ; and he suspected , justly or unjustly , that if they had n't bungled away so long with the something or others his heart would have been all right . " They just drained the strength out of me , " he thought , " and then they were hellishly surprised to find Ihad n't any left to go on with . " All right then , he was dying , and nobody , not the doctors , not Miss Thornton , not himself , could do much about it . Just the same , he thought , Miss Thornton might keep quiet for a minute . A minute of silent prayer would do her good . He wished it were eleven o'clock on Armistice Day  --  but , no , he doubted if even that would immobilize her . " Miss Thornton , " he said , " why do n't you cultivate repose ? " She turned her head to smile at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-ordered face . " I 'll be through now in just a second , Senator Dacier . We have to keep things tidy , you know . " He did n't know . If keeping things tidy hurt his heart and if his heart hurt him , he saw no reason in the world for keeping things tidy . But he was too weak to explain . He reached for the morning paper beside him and closed his eyes behind it because he did n't want to read ; and although he did n't especially want to think , he had discovered during the eight tedious months of constant weakness and intermittent agony that it was possible to make his thoughts play fair . It was true that until he had dominated them and put them in their proper place they had given him some rather terrible days and nights . They had had a way of exaggerating all his little peccadillos  --  of turning and torturing and magnifying everything in his past , like a clever prosecuting attorney aiming to fasten a crime on an almost guiltless person . Almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or any other day for that matter . Active in politics for thirty-two years , he had never traded his vote for anything that in law could be construed as a bribe . He had , like many another shrewd man with powerful friends , made a modest fortune into one less modest ; but , unlike many another shrewd man , he had never laid himself open to going to jail . He chuckled a little . He chuckled at the idealistic jackass he had been in his youth . State Assemblyman Dacier , six years out of Harvard , if you please , believing rather uneasily that the will of the people was the will of God , had on two occasions ventured to vote for what he was convinced were vaguely inspired causes . He had voted against his own party  --  the Grand Old Party . . . . Well , really , as he looked back on it , they had been very lenient with him . But during the rest of his career he had never made another such slip on a vote of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying in his bed at sixty , was a world figure , a statesman , as he could n't help phrasing it , who had won the admiration and the respect of the Republican Party throughout the nation ; and that party except for the unfortunate eight years of Wilson and the recent fiasco of last November , had been the will of the people and hence for the time being , the will of God . Yes , that was the way in which he had taught his thoughts to behave . Better to think that way than to read the newspapers these dark days . Strange , unprecedented goings-on were being reported by the papers . The miserable ignorant masses had elected for president a Democrat who , as the Senator interpreted it , had turned Socialist overnight . " Pretty soon , " thought the Senator , not at all gloomily , " this country is going to be run for the benefit of the lazy , ignorant , incapable poor . Thank God , I 'm getting outl " And he was very well aware that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would have been ignominiously kicked out . As it was he had two more years of office and perhaps only two more weeks of life . Could n't last much more . In fact , almost any day now .. . . Not for the first time he wondered what had become of Adele . He had not been able to do much about Adele during the months in the hospital when the surgeons had been cutting things out of him . A good part of the time he had scarcely been conscious : intense pain  --  morphineblessed blankness  --  and then more pain . But at his insistent demand Adele had been permitted to come once to see him . She was very lovely as always and , as always , quite unaffectedly cheerful ; and never having known great physical suffering herself , she was never convinced that such a thing was not exaggerated both by the sufferer and , to a less degree , by those who ministered to him . " You 're all right , " she had said , " in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about you so much you 'd be on your feet in two weeks . " The Senator , from whom they had but recently removed several feet of intestines , had been glad to see that she really believed what she was saying . He had not disillusioned her . " You 've been a ridiculous optimist all the ten  --  the twelve years that I 've known you , " he had said . " And you look plenty well enough . And you 're still young . How old are you ? Thirty-five ? " " Dear me , " she had said , " I 'll soon be forty . " " Well ? " and he had spoken only with a great effort and because he had made up his mind that he ought to speak ? " well , my dear , get another and a younger man . Do n't hang round in the night air after sunset , " Then he had instructed her to call on Hershey , his lawyer , and , because the time was up and he knew himself exhausted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he calculated , had been almost six months ago and he had not seen her since . They had insisted on conveying him in an ambulance from the hospital in Washington to his sister 's house nearby in the country . To convalesce ? They knew better . . . " Blah ! " he said , more than half aloud . " I beg your pardon , Senator ? " begged Miss Thornton , alert to catch at a straw . " Nothing . I said , Blahr What I was thinking though was that hypocrisy is all very well as a design for living , but it has no place in a scheme for dying . And I 'd like to see my sister if she 's not busy . " The nurse looked at him dubiously . He might have been a very handsome man , she thought , before he had had all this sickness . And everybody told her that he had a great mind . Perhaps , she humbly thought , that was why , even after the months she had tended him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she much cared . " I 'll see , " she said , and went to the hall in her rubber-soled shoes . In three minutes she knocked and opened the door simultaneously . Good hospital training , that . " Miss Dacier 's come to see you , Senator , " she announced with a sort of bright exultation , as if she had managed to bring in Joan of Arc . " Hello , Hester , " said the Senator . " Sit down here and do n't move anything in the room . All right , Miss Thornton  --  thank you . " The door shut and Hester , smiling , sat down on the chair indicated . " Good morning , Henry , " she said . " It 's a beautiful day and the lilacs are coming out . " " As if I cared , " said the Senator gently . " No ; I do n't suppose you do . But you 'll probably be annoyed because your bed is going to be wheeled to the window . Doctor Boughton 's orders . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Something more for Miss Thornton to do . " And he added viciously , " I 'd like to have Miss Thornton helpless in this bed so I could wheel her round  --  and give her alcohol baths . " " I see that you 're feeling better , " said Hester . " Yes , perhaps I am . I 'm better enough to have something on my mind . That 's why I asked for you , I want you to consent to something that you wo n't like , but I warn you in advance that I 'm going to have my way . " " Very well , " said his sister ; " what is your way ? " There was a pause . As he had well known , his way would be difficult to indicate  --  the more so because he was essentially a man who had always adhered to the good old outward conventions of conduct so long as they did not seriously interfere with his wellbeing . Nevertheless , he decided to come clean . " There 's a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her name is Adele Bates . Do you know her ? " Hester smoothed back her smooth , closely coifed brown hair . " I have n't met her , " said she , " but I have n't avoided meeting her . It was quite natural that those mutual acquaintances we have should not have thrown us together . . . . If you 'd care to have her come out here to see you , Henry . I 've not the slightest objection . " The Senator gazed at his sister with that sense of uneasy awe that he invariably felt when another human being read his mind . Hester was very keen . He remembered now other occasions on which she had proved to be keen . " Deep , " he thought , " but not forever solemn about it . She 's a Dacier . " Aloud he said , " Thank you , Hester . You 've made it a little easier for me to say that I want Adele to come here and stay in the house . Now wait ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't to ask you to do this . It 's your house , and you 're my sister , and twelve years ago Adele was my mistress . I 'm not going to pretend to you that we were just good friends  --  although we were that too and , thank God , still are . And I 'm not going to excuse myself by pointing out the rather agreeable fact that my legal wife has seen best to save Humanity away from her home . Her work has carried her to far away places  --  which is entirely her own fault . And to be quite truthful , Hester , I do n't in the least mind her saving young girls and bringing jellies to convicts  --  at a suitable distance from me ... . Adele has more than filled her place . I want Adele here . " He was not exhausted , but he had cleared the hurdle . He closed his eyes and waited . " If you 'll give me the address , " said Hester , " I 'll write to Miss Bates to-day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great deal , not from me but from her . " The Senator held out his hand , she patted it reassuringly . " You 're good , Hester , " he said . " You 're a remarkably good woman . I 'm taking advantage of the fact . " " Time 's upl " called Miss Thornton , like a bold , bright bird in the doorway . Hester wrote to Adele that afternoon . Not being at all a fool , she had known long ago of the intimacy between the Senator and that rather mysterious Miss Bates , a woman who knew all of the amusing people in Washington and who yet never made the slightest attempt to step into a strictly defined social circle where she would have been perforce rebuffed . She was a woman who , the harshest of her critics had to admit , " knew her place " ; and for knowing it and not showing the least concern about it , much was forgiven her . But Hester was well aware that what she was about to do would create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Adele 's presence at Senator Dacier 's deathbed could be interpreted in only one way ? " and the right way , too , " added Hester to herself . Certainly the right way . A dying man summons the woman he loves . That he has a legal wife elsewhere is merely unfortunate for everybody . Hester smiled . " Legal wife . " For years now the Senator had never referred to Florence Dacier otherwise . " My legal wife , " in a tone of pity , of sarcasm , or of complete indifference . Florence , of course , should have divorced him . That was where Hester had been perfectly in accord with her brother and , indeed , on two occasions had ventured to tell Florence so . But Florence was a selfish woman and an earnest , ambitious one , who was determined to continue her career of helping fallen girls and neglected convicts with the prestige of being the important wife of Senator Dacier . Hester sighed ; and her note to Adele was urgent and cordial . . . . Adele @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invitation twice to herself and then , not without hesitation , handed it to Carlos , who sat beside her . As he read it his face betrayed a frowning inter-est that verged on anger . When he had finished it he tossed the note carelessly back to her . " So he is at last really dying , " he said , his English only touched with a Spanish accent . " We can not truthfully say that we are sorry , can we , dearest one ? " " I can and do . He was a grand man . " Carlos shrugged his shoulders . He was five years younger than Adele and he treated her like a child . He liked to think that he did her thinking for her . " Let us gladly admit that he was a grand man  --  a grand and stubborn man who has outlived his usefulness . It would be tragic for him were he to live longer . It has been tragic for you and for me that he has lived so long . . . . Now this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse it , carissima . It is an insult . " He was not yet angry , but she saw that he was preparing to be . He stood up  --  tall , slender , dark , a most creditable example of a Guatemalan mestizo . The quarter strain of Indian that was in him was plainly and pleasantly evident . It had given him a grace of movement and a beauty of bearing and far-seeing black eyes . The rest of him , which was Spanish , was indolent and arrogant and perfumed . " It is an insult , " he repeated when he was on his feet He wondered why she remained silent . Was it possible that she did not comprehend that it was an insult ? Women never saw eye to eye with men when it was a matter of insults ; and , stranger still , they disagreed among themselves concerning them . The reason for this was , as he well knew , that no woman possessed a code of honor , however low , to which she was willing consistently to adhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She uncrossed and recrossed her handsome legs . " No , " she said at last ; " I guess that I 'll have to go . " He glanced at her sharply , sat down again beside her , took her head between his hands and firmly turned it toward him . He kissed her on the lips , but if the kiss meant anything at all it meant simply that she must be good . Then he told her how and why . " You do not grasp the significance of your going to the Senator 's deathbed . You have not stopped to consider the only interpretation that the public could put upon your presence there  --  in his sister 's house , remember , and at his command or request or prayer or what you will . Very well , then , let me explain . First let me ask you what persons may the public expect a man naturally to call for when he is dying ? His wife ? Certainly , but you are not his wife . His blood relative ? Certainly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor , his lawyer ? Obviously , but you are neither . His trained nurse ? Yes , but you are not site . His mistress , then ? Yes , indeed ' What more human and natural and comprehensible and touching than that a man should call out from his deathbed to summon his well-loved mistress ? Oh , my dearest little na  --  ve child , need I point out to you that if you accept the Senator 's entirely selfish invitation you and he will be declaring to the world that you are precisely his well-loved mistress . You can go in no other role  --  or at least the eager public , if you go , will accept you in no other role . You will be cast to play that part for life . . . . There , now I think that I have made it all quite clear , have I not ? " She answered him absent-mindedly , as if all the time she had been many jumps ahead of his elucidations . " But you 're so silly , Carlos , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean , what everybody would think . " " What everybody would at last be completely justified in thinking , " he corrected her . " There is a difference . " She smiled . " Not so very much , " she said , too casually for his taste . " Not so very much after all . And the poor dear old Senator  --  at his age  --  with a mistress  --  oh , my darling ! " It was at this point that Carlos became angry . He perceived only too well that she was attaching no importance to her reputation , that she was recklessly willing to be publicly branded . Unfortunately this branding business would affect not only her own future , but his . " And so you laughl " he cried hotly . " And so you are able to laugh and to quibble . The poor old Senator , you say , at his age with a mistress , and you laugh . Yes , you laugh . Mother of God , you can /aught Because of his age you are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand , is it not ? You would prefer perhaps to be known as the Senator 's former mistress  --  the mistress of his youth . " " Oh , never of his youth , " she put in ; " Iet 's say his prime . I never laid eyes on him until he was forty-eight . " " The mistress of Senator Dacier when he was forty-eight ! " shouted Carlos . " Is that the way I shall say it ? Eh ? The mistress of Senator Dacier when he was forty-eight , the former mistress who continues to be so intimate with him that she is invited to close his eyes when he dies  --  yes , yes  --  and who continues to occupy the apartment for which he has always paid the rent  --  yes , yes , I say yes  --  and who is generously remembered in his will . " Adele , having had enough , stopped him short . " He might change the will , " she suggested brightly but pointedly . " Yes , yes , it 's my turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change the will . Some people just wo n't forgive ingratitude , you know . " Well , she had known that this remark would be devastating ; but she was enough in love to be ashamed for him when she saw how completely he could be stunned by a purely mercenary argument . He ceased at once to be vocal and she judged that he was probably trying to adjust himself to the new situation , weighing the value of her reputation against the value of the Senator 's bequest . She tried to tell herself that this was not really as contemptible as it seemed ; that he was bound to give due consideration to her future financial independence ; that if the Senator should leave her penniless it was within the range of probability that she would starve . This preoccupation of his in regard to her financial future would have been excusable perhaps except for one damning thing : he intended to share that future with her . She had promised to marry him  --  she wanted to marry him  --  she was passionately in love with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stipulated that they should not go through any public and formal ceremony during the Senator 's lifetime . She said to herself , " Perhaps I was wrong to have done that . Perhaps the Senator would n't have minded so very much . " She glanced at Carlos who was still weighing values . He looked sullen and discomfited . Poor boy , it was hard on him . He very likely would have to give up his career in the diplomatic service of Guatemala . Young diplomats do not marry other men 's branded mistresses . And then suddenly she was terrified . Suppose that he should decide to solve his problem in the way most satisfactory to himself  --  allow her to go to the Senator 's bedside , remain until his death , and receive his gratitude , his blessing , and the legacy . Let her be publicly branded if that was necessary . All that Carlos would have to give up in that case was legitimizing their present relations . " Carlos ! " she cried in alarm . " What are you going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He understood that , for the moment , he had triumphed . He was pleased to observe that she was now as anxious as he . That was better  --  that was as it should be . He was mollified . " Beloved , " he said gently , " the only unselfish advice I can give you is to go to the Senator . It means that I lose you , that of course we can never marry . But I am bound to put your interests above mine . You must , as you said , go to the Senator . You must not as you so wisely hinted just now , show yourself ungrateful to a dying man . " Exactly what she had expected . How well  --  how cruelly well  --  she knew him . How sickening that , knowing him , she should passionately adore him . " You 're pretty despicable , are n't you , Carlos ? " He looked at her soberly in the eyes . " You should not say that , my dearest . I have never deceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you have always considered me despicable . . . . And yet you claim to have loved me . " He kissed her hands . " I am leaving you now . Whatever you decide to do I , at least , shall not consider you despicable . And I shall continue , carissima , to love you . " She admitted to herself when he had gone that the last thing he had said was true  --  whatever she decided he would continue to love her to the same extent he had ever loved her . Adele 's arrival at Miss Dacier 's followed her prompt telegram of acceptance by only six hours ; and Miss Dacier had herself driven to the station in the limousine to meet her guest . A little too urban perhaps , the limousine , especially on a lusty May day with all the lilacs in bloom ; but Hester was over fifty and felt that she no longer had to pretend to enjoy too much open air . The meeting of the women on the platform held no complications . Yes , Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the chauffeur , promptly attended to these . " Of course , " said Adele as they started away , " of course , Miss Dacier , I had really no idea how long I should be here . You wo n't think it presumptuous of me to have brought a trunk ? even a small one ? " How beautiful she looked , thought Hester . How healthful and how young in comparison to poor , pain-shrivelled Henry . Probably not forty yet and appeared several years less . " I 'm afraid , " said Hester , " that none of us knows how long . My brother has all of his mind left but scarcely an ounce of his vitality . There is nothing the doctors can do for him except to lessen his suffering as much as they can . I think , Miss Bates , that he needs you very much , and I need n't say that I am very grateful to you . " Adele hesitated a moment before she spoke . She might , she knew , do one of two things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her being Hester 's guest at this very especial time , or she could face it frankly . But whichever course she chose , she knew that she must choose it at once . She was smiling a little when she turned to Hester . " Miss Dacier , " she said , " a lot of good people are going to pillory you for asking me out here . It 's not done , is it ? " " No , " agreed Hester , " it is not done . " " In fact it 's scandalous . " " There will be a scandal , " said Hester evenly , " and I wonder if you will mind my saying that I fear it is you who will have to bear the brunt of the scan-dal . That is why I appreciate so deeply your coming to us . " Adele drew a breath of relief . " I do n't believe people can hurt me as much as you think . If they say that I must have been your brother 's mistress  --  well , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that you asked me out here might tend to whitewash me . You see it could work two ways . " Hester said , " Yes , Miss Bates , it could work two ways but it wo n't . You 'll be voted guilty and I shall be accused of aiding and abetting the crime at the last . " She held out her hand . " Conspirators , " she said , with a dim smile . " By all means , " said Adele , and shook the proffered hand warmly . . . . " What gorgeous lilacs you have , Miss Dacier I " Hester was gratified . She had found likeable qualities in this Miss Bates . Adele was allowed to see the Senator that afternoon . " Ten minutes only , " said a mystified Miss Thornton , outside the door , " and of course you know that the Senator must not be excited . " " Oh , " said Adele , " I never excited anybody in my life . " Miss Thornton did not believe her , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just the same she had " heard talk . " Adele bent and kissed Senator Dacier , first on the forehead and then on each cheek . Then she sat down . " Well , here we are , Henry , " she said . The Senator grunted . " Adele , you 're the ace of trumps . " " Am I ? 1 do n't mind being the high card , but it is n't like you to be so humble . " " Hell , " said the Senator , " they 've broken my spirit " He kept his eyes on her . What a very lovely woman she was , he thought . A small , blonde woman in a big chair . Plenty of brains too , but she did n't gobooming all over the country . His legal wife did that . " If you want my opinion , " said Adele , " I think you 're looking pretty well . " " I know what I look like , " the Senator told her calmly . They wo n't let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a mirror to my face once in a white . It 's not encouraging . .. Listen to me , Adele , and do n't talk cheerful nonsense . I know I 'm going to die any day and I do n't mind in the least . Now , that 's the truth . All halfway decent people ought to be very glad to die before they 're murdered by the Communists . Even if they do n't kill you they 'll take all your property , my dear . " She laughed . " Not if I marry a Commissar , or whatever they call them . " " Good ! you 've brought up my first point . I do want you to marry , Adele , as soon as I 'm out of the way . And you 'd better marry a future Commissar because , as you know , you 're going to be a woman of some property . That brings me to point number two . No , do n't start a string of objections . I 'm not leaving you any startling sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my will . My legal wife gets her legal share , and Hester the rest . I 'm not leaving you a thing  --  I 'm giving it to you to-morrow . There , now , I 've made clear the two things that were on my mind . " He was panting a little . It was quite plain that he must not be crossed . " AlI right , my dear , " she said . " It 's nice of you to make me rich and to try to marry me off . " " No , " he said , " it is n't . And until Miss Thornton comes in I love you very much . " She kissed him quickly on the lips . " Even after Miss Thornton comes in , " she said . When , a few minutes later , she was alone in her large bedroom , so beautifully designed by and for a lady , she asked herself if she was not out of place in it . Miss Dacier 's quietly expensive chintzes and old mahogany and clean-scented linen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rule , was far from being a woman given to imaginings , could not help admitting that she had brought along with her from that last sordid and unsavory conversation with Carlos a trace of the gutter . Usually she tried to be honest with herself . Usually she could be honest with herself and not be ashamed . But lately , ever since her love for Carlos seemed to have become for her the most important thing in her life , she had begun to doubt her own decency . Could a woman pretend to be decent , she asked , and continue to be in love with a cad ? Cad ? It was n't a pretty word , but gigolo , though more euphonious , amounted to the same thing and merely shifted the character from melodrama to farce . " Poor Adele Bates is madly in love with that cad , " sounded a shade better , she thought , than : " Poor old Adele would do anything in the world for that gigolo of hers . " But  --  honestly again  --  both of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwittingly perhaps , making everything so easy for her . Carlos or no Carlos , money or no money , she would have accepted Miss Dacier 's invitation . That much she sturdily insisted upon as a point in her favor . All right . But what really did she stand to lose ? Her public reputation  --  yes , of course . As Carlos had said so fiercely , she would be " branded . " And , as a sequel , she would lose all chance of a marriage to him . But would she ? Had n't she just now called him a cad and a gigolo ? Well , then . The Senator was going to give her a sum of money to-morrow  --  in cash , shesupposed , or stocks or bonds . He was not waiting until he died . That was thoughtful of him , for it obviated her name being publicized in his will . She had no intention , and she had never had any intention even before she met Carlos , of refusing this money . She had not greatly cared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind to ask ; but Hershey , the Senator 's lawyer , had told her when she had gone to see him at the Senator 's request . About one hundred thousand dollars . If she packed that up in her trunk and returned to Carlos tomorrow she had no reason to fear for the future . Her brief overnight visit to Miss Dacier 's house might be pardoned by the gossips , or even never known . But was n't a longer visit expected of her ? Was n't it really her duty to stay on and on , until he should die ? Duty  --  duty ! Of course it was her duty . It was her duty but it was n't obligatory . She was not compelled to be decent . She could grab her money and go . " And , of course , " she said to herself stoutly , " of course I 'll do no such thing . . . . At least I hope I wo n't . " She went down to join Hester for dinner . They sat facing each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a porch off the rather vast dining room . Hester , who disliked outdoor discomforts , had managed somehow or other to make the porch bug-proof and draft-proof ; and although the flames of the two candles swayed nonchalantly from time to time , they never were in real danger . It was peaceful , sybaritic , and unostentatious . They talked a while of current politics , about which Miss Bates was by far the better informed ; but they were both interested in what they then were saying and there was no effort made to avoid a more intimate conversation , It was Miss Dacier who asked at length , " How did the Senator 's condition impress you , Miss Bates ? " " It 's hard for me to say . I 'm afraid , Miss Dacier , that I 'm the sort of person that ca n't think a case is hopeless unless I see desperate signs of it before my very eyes . If the Senator had had , let 's say , a leg or an arm amputated I 'd be more shocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come home to me . But when I see him lying there in bed with all his arms and legs , and his mind active and sharp as ever , and just as contented as ever to be discontented with the affairs of the nation  --  well , I do n't know . He seems like a weak , emaciated Senator , but not  --  but not necessarily a dying Senator . Does that sound as if I were awfully thick-skinned ? " " No ; it sounds perfectly reasonable . Of course you 've not seen him during one of his attacks . They are rather terrifying . We do n't think he can live through another of them , and that 's why we are selfish enough to hope you will stay with us until it 's all over . I 'm not sure that my brother thinks of it quite that way ; all I know is that he would rather have you with him now than anybody else in the world . Perhaps I ought to tell you that he has violently forbidden me to ask his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Adele reflectively . And then , with a smile at Miss Dacier , she said again , " yes . " They rose from the table and moved down the porch to take their coffee off cushions and rattan . The scent of the lilacs came to them on the mannerly breeze that Miss Dacier now permitted to enter . Suddenly Adele said , " Miss Dacier , I 'm going to be married . The Senator does n't know it yet and if I tell him he wo n't like it . He wo n't like it mainly because he has no use for the man . As far as my getting marriedgoes , he 's all in favor of it in the abstract , but .. . " Miss Dacier looked at her closely in the very dim light , and when Adele did not go on to complete her sentence , she said , " I devoutly hope you wo n't tell my brother anything about it . I think that it might seriously upset him , and  --  and surely you do n't think it necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It would not be at all necessary , " answered Adele gravely , " except that to-morrow the Senator intends to give me a hundred thousand dollars . " How much of the true situation Miss Dacier grasped Adele never knew ; but she hoped for the sake of Carlos that Hester could believe that this small fortune had not entered into his prenuptial calculations . All that Hester said was , " Oh , so that 's why Mr. Hershey is coming out to-morrow . " And she added after an interval , " I 'm extremely glad , Miss Bates  --  sincerely glad . And although I think I appreciate your scruples , it seems to me that it only makes it the more important that you should n't tell my brother of your proposed marriage . Do n't deal him that blow , I beg of you . He is in no condition to balance nice ethical questions  --  are any of us , in fact ? Come , Miss Bates , a thing is either right or wrong to me only in the effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wo n't you agree with me ? " Adele nodded . " I 'll agree with you , Miss Dacier . I wo n't tell Henry , and I 'll stay here with him as long as you want me . " " I think , " said Miss Dacier slowly , " that that is rather wonderful of you . " The next morning Adele was sure that it was quite wonderful of her . The maid brought in a telegram on the breakfast tray . It was brief  --  well within ten words  --  but it was ominous . " Insist you return immediately . All Washington already gabbling . " There was no signature . There was none needed . She knew it was Carlos giving her her last chance to become his respectable wife . Poor Carlos  --  for even at his worst she thought of him only as " poor Carlos ? " making his gentlemanly gesture , salving his strange conscience , and no doubt hoping that she would disobey him and , by so doing , not return empty-handed . She had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Senator and Mr. Hershey was not until eleven o'clock ; there was plenty of time to bathe and to dress and to deliberate . There was time even to look through the Washington newspaper that the maid had brought in to her . .. Nothing in the paper  --  that is , nothing that was personal to her or the Senator . Oh , yes , Mrs. Senator Dacier had made a speech urging everybody to give everything they had to the Emergency Fund . It was very noble of her . And the American dollar had dropped to about eighty-four cents . That was n't so good . . . . The Senator was propped up on his pillows talking to Hershey when Adele came into the room . He looked a very sick man in the morning light . " You two know each other , do n't you ? " he said . " AI1 right . . . . No , I do n't feel rested this morning , so for God 's sake do n't ask . Hershey , bring out the tin box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the box he took a packet of bonds and laid them on the bed . " This , " said the Senator , " is a ridiculous proceeding . Are you sure you 've counted them correctly , Hershey ? Well , I 'll believe you . If you believe him , too , Adele , there are a hundred and two thousand dollars ' worth of bonds of the U. S. Government , payable in gold  --  in gold , mind you . Well , the Democratic Administration has recently decided that they just wo n't pay you in gold  --  that the whole thing wasonly a joke on the bondholders . If they continue with that sort of financial wizardry it is quite possible that what I 'm giving you to-day wo n't be worth more than a bunch of old newspapers to-morrow . However , it 's the best I cart " do . If I were you I 'd sell them right away and invest what you can get for ' cm in a good honest oil stock or a silver mine in Nevada . Lone women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hershey ? " The lawyer smiled tolerantly . " I imagine , " he said , " that Miss Bates knows you well enough not to take you seriously . " " Pahl " said the Senator . " I was never more serious in my life . No , Adele , I 'm giving you the securities that people used to set aside for widows and orphans , and if the United States goes back on its word , it 's not my fault . You will remember that I lived and died an honest Republican , and that honest Republicans have n't much to say this ) . ear . " " I 'll be voting for you in 1934 , " said Adele . The Senator 's face relaxed into less querulous lines . He nodded at Mr. Hershey . " She 's all right , Hershey , is n't she ? One of the Old Guard . Straight Republican ticket every time , God bless herl . . . I think you 'd both better get out , now . Go down and talk to Hester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Yes , yes , Miss Thornton , come in . The conference is over . " Adele did not follow Mr. Hershey downstairs . Instead , with the tin box under her arm , she went back to her own room . Obviously one did not bring a tin box into Hester 's parlor or even onto her porch . No , the tin box must be placed in her trunk and the trunk carefully locked . The maid had not finished doing up the room , but Adele dismissed her . She hoped that maids did not know that tin boxes usually contained things of great value . She felt a little guilty ? as if she had stolen something . When she had put away what she absurdly was beginning to think of as her loot she sat down at the desk to compose an answer to Carlos ' telegram . As to what she intended to do , her mind was definitely made up . If the hundred and two thousand dollars was loot , she at least would sacrifice herself to earn it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blank . " Am staying indefinitely . " And while debating whether to add more , she decided that that was enough . The question then arose of how to dispatch the message with a fair amount of discretion . She wondered if Miss Dacier would be willing to let her drive herself to the station in the Senator 's roadster , and her mind was about made up to submitting this request when Miss Dacier , herself , knocked at the door . Adele saw at once that something must have happened of no picayune importance , for Hester was not only embarrassed but angry . Her usually delicately tinted face was flushed . Her usually firm lips were actually trembling . At that moment she reminded Adele of the Senator on the occasions when he let himself go . " I 'm sorry , Miss Bates , but I 've got to talk to you . Something terrible has happened  --  terrible and inexcusable . " Immediately Adele thought of her tin box and its contents . That illogical feeling of guilt still was in her . She asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that  --  if Miss Dacier , doubtless spurred on by Mr. Hershey , was going to protest against so generous a gift . But she quickly learned that she had misjudged the Senator 's sister . " I am very much upset , " said Hester in a tone that proved it , " I am very angry . Just now I lost my temper with that  --  that damned woman . " Hester used her " damn " with the relish known only to those who are not habituated to the word . " That damned whited sepulcher I " said she . " Good for you , Miss Dacier , " Adele exclaimed . " Do sit down , and please do n't try to keep calm . " Hester permitted herself a wry smile at her own wrath , but although she sat down , the wrath was by no means appeased . " The Senator 's wife has just arrived , " she said ? " the Senator 's legal wife , as he calls her . " " Good God ! " said Adele . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Good God from every point of view . It will kill the Senator among other things . I do n't suppose she stopped to think of that . No , she heard things in Washington , she said . She heard things in Washington and she thought it time to assert her legal rights to come to her husband 's bedside . She wants to assert her legal rights to kill him , because just the sight of her would send him into a rage  --  in fact just the knowledge that she was here in the house . And a rage would kill him . " Miss Dacier paused to catch her breath before she concluded with the rather remarkable statement , " I 've locked her in the library ! " Adele regarded her with a look of amazed admiration . " You 've locked her in the library ! " she repeated . " Yes , and told the servants not to let her out . It 's my house , after all . She might have remembered that it was before she drove up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep her in the library forever , Miss Dacier . " " That , " said Miss Dacier grimly , " is the trouble . " Adele had to think quickly . The way to her own instant departure was clearly indicated . An instant departure was in truth being forced upon her . She went to Miss Dacier and patted the back of her hand sympathetically . " 1 ca n't tell you how sorry I am about all the complications that seem to be piling up on you , Miss Dacier , and you 'll understand , I 'm sure , that I 'm in no position to advise or to  --  well , I ca n't say what I think as freely as you can . The only thing I can do is to eliminate myself as soon as possible . It 's out of the question , naturally , that the Senator 's wife and I  --  the good old phrase is the best  --  that the Senator 's wife and I should ' steep under the same roof . ' " Hester nodded a gloomy acquiescence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has made it impossible for everybody . All I can do is to apologize for her . " " There 's no need of that , Miss Dacier . If you do n't mind , I 'll ring for the maid to help me pack . Do you know when the first train goes ? " Miss Dacier said ruefully that there was one in an hour , but she insisted that Adele drive in the limousine to the city . " Just a moment , " objected Adele . " I forgot to ask . Does Mrs. Dacier know I 'm here ? " " She said she knew it . She said she had heard people saying so in Washington , and ? " " And she decided to dispossess me . " " That , " said Miss Dacier , " is about the sum of it . You know that I wish to heaven you would stay in spite of her . But I have n't insulted you by begging you to do so . " Adele smiled and shook her head . " One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this I think you 'll find that it 's not often the wife who goes .. . . Legality has its privileges , Miss Dacier . " She was packed and ready to depart in twenty minutes . The tin box she had managed to squeeze into her small suitcase which she herself carried down the stairs to the hall . Miss Dacier was waiting for her . In one hand she held a large key  --  to the library , thought Adele , and laughed aloud . " Yes , " said Hester with a valiant toss of her head , " I do n't trust her . She would be quite capable of rushing in on the Senator the minute I let her loose . " She put her arm on Adele 's shoulder . " You wo n't mind if I kiss you , my dear ? " she asked gravely . " It is very seldom , you see , that I have the privilege of meeting such a splendid person . Good-by , Miss Bates , and may God bless you and be as generous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the limousine Adele wondered if she was being in the least generous to anybody . At her feet lay the suitcase with the tin box and a hundred and two thousand dollars . In a little more than an hour she would be back in Washington . As far as Carlos was concerned she had but obeyed his orders and returned promptly . There was now not the slightest doubt in her mind that he would gladly make her his legal wife . " Legal wife , " she repeated . The words had a new and an unpleasant connotation . " Legal wife ? " It gave her a little mental shudder ; but once again she tried to be honest with herself . Was it the institution of marriage that had ceased to appeal to her , or was it the person called Carlos ? The latter , she thought ; and she was rather inclined to thank God .
