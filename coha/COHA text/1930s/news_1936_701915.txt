txt On a materially expanded volume of business through April and the first half of May the automobile parts and equipment makers have shown impressive gains in earnings . Continuing heavy releases for the remainder of May and probable substantial business in June make prospects good that earnings for the quarter will be well in excess of the of the second , and best , quarter of 1935 . A few of the largest suppliers whose first quarter profits were under the corresponding 1935 period expect a recovery that will lift profits this quarter up to or above a year ago . Those whose first quarter 's net was ahead of a year ago will , with probably no exceptions , earn profits this three months which will be larger than for the second period last year . Large Gain in Production The greatly improved outlook arises from the heavy production of automobiles which for the current three months will be approximately 24cr , over the first quarter of this year and about 11% ahead of the corresponding quarter of last year . Indications are that the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around 270,000 cars , whereas the second quarter gain last year amounted to but 155,000 units . Of considerable significance in the larger earnings prospect this year has been the ability , of the industry to maintain an unusually uniform pace of production . Production line from its peak in late April has gradually declined , and probably will continue this trend except for minor interruptions until production is stopped sometime in the Summer for plant thangeovers for new models . But the change has been so gradual that the industry has been able to maintain its employment and operate close to maximum efficiency . Ford Production Earnings decline shown by some parts makers in the first quarter was accounted for in large part by Ford Motor production which was under its high rate of the previous year . Ford 's output in the current three months has been . at an even rate and promises to exceed slightly that of the first three months when , in common with the industry , assemblies were at changing rates because of the February slump . Almost half of the gain in production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be by- General Motors units , this corporation having made notable progress in increasing its share of the car market this year . Since the corporation owns many of its parts and equipment suppliers , the independent accessory companies will not participate as heavily in the production gain as would be the case if other automobile manufacturers were to enjoy comparable increases . Auto-Lite and Motor Wheel Electric Auto-Lite Co. and Motor Wheel Corp . are likely to show the widest gains over the second quarter of last year , as well as over first quarter results . Auto-Lite , while doing a large business last year with Chrysler as a principal customer , enjoyed only a small rnar ? gin of profit with net profit in the second quarter amounting to about $650,000 , or 49 cents a share on the common . It is likely that earnings this quarter will more than double that amount . They will compare also with net of approximately 6859,000 , or 65 cents a common share . in the first quarter . Motor Wheel , doing a business with General Motors , Chrysler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to show a large increase as compared with a year ago when second quarter net was roughly $260,000 , or 30 cents a share . In the first quarter of this year company reported $370,000 or 43 cents a share . Such companies as Briggs Manufacturing , Murray Corp . of America , Houdaille-Hershey , Bohn Aluminum and others doing a considerable Ford business are enjoying larger earnings currently and at least one and probably two of these will have as profitable operations this period as a year ago if Ford production continues to hold somewhere near present levels , as is expected . These companies all do business with Chrylser and their volume for this account will be larger this quarter than a year ago . Third Quarter Prospect Looking beyond the current three months into the third quarter the outlook is reckoned as for somewhat larger operations and probably a little better in the way of profits than for the corresponding 1935 period . Present plans are for most lines to close a month earlier than was the case a year ago , with production by parts makers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and September . Thus , they are apt to get business in the third period which last year did not materialize until the final quarter . No important model changes are expected . with one exception , so that the shutdown for re-establishing production facilities for new models should take very little time . The heavy volume of retail sales of automobiles currently , together with the persistent high level of cyders for new cars at factories , is a potent spur to management to be out of production for as short a period as possible . One important manufacturer will continue operating at a fast pace into the middle or latter part of July in order to supply its present and indicated demand . The uniformity with which production is continuing makes for more orderly scheduling of production and at the same time enables the manufacturers and parts suppliers to devote more time to prepare for new model production . As a result parts makers already are gradually making necessary manufacturing revisions preparatory to picking up new model production with the least possible delay .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
