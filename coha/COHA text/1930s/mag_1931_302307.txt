No Eye on Bottle <P> Sirs : <P> In your issue of Nov. 16 there appears an article on my election to Congress , a part of which surprised and considerably distressed me . You state that " he went into the campaign as a lashing , slashing Wet . He declared that he always got all the liquor he wanted and that he intended to keep on drinking whenever he chose . " <P> It is true that I stated repeatedly during my campaign that I thought the 18th Amendment had proved a mistake and that I was therefore in favor of its repeal and pending such action I favored any reasonable modification of the enforcement act . Since my opponent had exactly the same views , needless to say the Prohibition question was not an issue in the campaign . <P> When I did discuss the Prohibition question I was particularly careful never to mention my personal habits or tastes as I felt very strongly they had nothing to do with the matter . I therefore can not imagine where you secured the information on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made me appear a somewhat blatant devil-may-care individual who keeps one eye cocked on the bottle , without much regard for law and order . This I hope is quite foreign to my nature and is not , I am sure , the opinion of my constituents . <P> I realize that on entering into politics one becomes somewhat of a public character and must expect to be misrepresented occasionally . Ordinarily , therefore , I would have paid no attention to your article but I have had so many protests from my friends that I have felt compelled to write you . I have been a subscriber to TIME for years and knowing the high calibre of its circulation I feel distressed at this misrepresentation . . . . <P> JOHN B. HOLLISTER <P> House of Representatives , U.S. Washington , D. C. <P> TIME , misinformed , regrets having misreported Congressman-elect Hollister 's stand on Prohibition. - ED . <P> <P> Texas ' Connally <P> Sirs : <P> The undersigned , registered ( poll tax ) voters of Texas , ask you to give an account of Texas ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ERNEST BAKER W.
