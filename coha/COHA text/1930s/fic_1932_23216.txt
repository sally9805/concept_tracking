BLACK ULYSSES A STORY BY R. HERNEKIN BAPTIST H A ! A rich , sunny day , the cold spring wind gone . The bird of happiness in Tenona 's heart , for long months together humped and ruffled in silent gloom , stirred and stretched itself . Tenona actually began to sing over his work  --  the heavy sigh and the song together which hot sunshine often forced from him . The canary also sang , with that ecstasy the activities of man seem to bring to little captive bodies denied the joy of energy in flight . For more than three years the bird and the man had sung together when the sun bade them . It was as if the bird also lifted weights , swept and polished his new day in the cage . Tenona piled up chairs and little tables in his arms as casually as a waiter piles up plates . It was nothing to Tenona when cleaning the bedrooms at great half-yearly upheavals to clasp a small wardrobe to his breast when a small wardrobe needed to be moved . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to his wife , a divine genius for luggage . Never had he had a hall porter so powerful , so willing , so silent in action , so childishly innocent and honest in money matters as this African blackamoor , Tenona . It was very obvious , too , that his clients appreciated that remarkable smile of welcome . Had d'Afrique ! Why , the man was a living inn-sign of the old days , a picture come to life . Certainly he had brought luck . He and the black cat Euclide , who had been systematically encouraged , nay , almost trained , as far as a cat may be trained , to sit on the doorstep or on the ceremonial mat of the Mel d'Afrique . Of course the black African was often morose and difficult on days of gloom and cold when he could hardly be got to move from the aura of the kitchen stove . But who that is human does not have his dark hours ? The sun can not always shine , that is certain . Tenona piled up tables and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soles , resilient and solid as the tire of a motor , danced and skated over the shining oilcloth which represented black and white tiles . Euclide , the black tomcat , imperial in his little collar of red leather , watched from the doorway the movement of those feet . When he paused in the prolonged toilet necessitated by the splendid morning , Euclide followed , with the unseeing intensity of preoccupation , the movements of those feet which had once been modelled by a passing sculptor to prove that the classic Greek foot , the male godlike foot , was not yet extinct in this world of clerks and weedy slaves of the machine . Tenona , his ritual in the hall finished , stepped over Euclide on to the pavement . He must now polish the bell , the knob of the door , and the beautiful brass plate on which it said " Hotel d'Afrique . " The pavement always made Tenona sing , on fine mornings . As he swept and polished , looking round on the new day , on the passing people , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Monotony , the meat and drink , hearth and roof of contented souls : rhythm in endless repetition , like a mirror of the seasons , the swinging cradle of the days  --  monotonous song was like a hand gently stroking an alien heart into comfort . On wet days the monotony of song filled the alien heart with tears . One had to fall silent . Oh , it was then that the weight of all the world 's loneliness bowed his head ! Like Atlas forever stooping under the world 's sorrows , so Tenona bent his head to the voice of memory . But on fine days his soft crooning , the crooning high-pitched whisper of the deep negroid voice , accompanied every gesture of the vigorous form . " ' Hotel d'Afrique , ' a black servant and a black eat . The omens are good . I shall outspan here whatever happens . " A young man getting out of a taxi .. . " Morning , John ! Sakubanal ( I do n't suppose I know his lingo , though ? he 's sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sakubona John ! " Tenona 's polishing song was interrupted by strange , familiar , beautiful sounds . A word fell like the voice of a bird in his ear . Like the voice of the bush-dove , so friendly and faithful , like the lovely speech of the lory which makes a man both to laugh and to cry , for is it not home and peace made audible ? " Master ! ' Nkosi " Who shall say the cry of the serf can not sometimes be mistaken for the cry of a child to his father ? Two grown men look in each other 's faces as brothers of one family will lookafter long separation , with smiles of joy , with a spontaneous clinging together of the hand . Beneath those smiles and that telegraphic pressure lies a lifetime of mutual experience . The depth of it no man can fathom . Who shall fathom it when it is as wide as Africa , warm as an African morning , safe as a fire in the hut ? " Baas ! Sakubona , " You are Zulu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tenona 's head is high , Tenona 's voice rings deep . Yet tears run down his face , speaking a language of their own . It is a language of which no savage is ashamed . No ! not until civilization has brought hardness and empty laughter will those inner fountains of the natural man dry up or freeze . " Your name and district ? " Name , chief 's name , name of his village  --  the heart is like a frozen river that flows again on a warm spring day ! " Umshongwi ? My uncle is magistrate there . Not far from BashoweMr . Brownlaw ? " " Baas ! Oh , Baas ! I was one of his police boys ! " At the thought of those proud and happy days Tenona turned aside and hid his face in the crook of his arm . Oh , it was too much soreness for him , the heart was too sore ! For , next to the military life , there is no white man 's profession which so harmonizes with the savage 's arrogance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom , and power as the profession of native police boy . Ha ! to march into a native kraal  --  it may , with luck , be one 's own village  --  dressed in the garb of white authority  --  what is that for happiness ! Switching your cane against your polished leggings , conscious of the glorious angle of your forage cap as it perches over one ear . . . The Hotel d'Afrique , with its unend-BLACK ULYSSES i69 ing small ritual of brushes , mops , buckets , cigarette-ends , and dirty wineglasses , suddenly overwhelmed Tenona , with shame . He thought , too , of the day when the chef had thrown a saucepan at him . True , the chef often threw a saucepan at the French kitchen boy Adolphe . But that was a different matter . Adolphe was not a Zulu . Adolphe , a puny creature , had never been in the notable police force of Zululand . He had never polished Mr. Brownlaw 's leggings nor brought round his horse , shining and beautiful . In fact , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty saucepan on the side of his head . Pride , so long asleep , began to stir in the breast of Tenona . And all because he was listening to the voice of Mr. Brownlaw 's brother 's child , and beyond that to the voice of the kraal , and beyond that again to the voice of Africa . What good fortune that Tenona had an evening off that Friday ! Young master must be protected in this town of great wickedness and astonishing ignorance . It was scarcely credible , but not one soul in it had ever heard of Bashowe , of Chief Samuel Gamuza , or of Mr. Brownlaw . Had they indeed even heard of the great country of Zululand ? Even that was " to be doubted . Tenona leaped , snorting his scorn and singing his joy , through the day 's work . Near the dinner hour he knocked respectfully , firmly on the young gentleman 's door , respectfully entered with the hot water . Mr. Brownlaw 's brother 's child was half-dressed and repacking . The room was in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of days when Mr. Brownlaw was getting ready for a journey . " Hullo , Tenona ! When are you going to show me the parts of the townthat are not in the guide-books ? You said you would , and my boat sails before noon to-morrow . And you promised to tell me how you got here , too . " " This night , my Baas , I will tell Baas that tale . Young 13a,9-5 come with me . I show him the ways in this town . Baas too little to be without Tenona in this town at night . Too little . " The words were repeated , his eyes searching the young man 's face , with that extraordinary , tender inflection that suffuses the black man 's voice when he speaks to the white child beloved . Johnnie Brownlaw , a fully fledged doctor , tall as Tenona and twenty-seven , laughed delightedly . It was long since he had heard that inflection . It was good , after six years in London , to be returning to his native Natal . Here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nearness of Africa even without this strange encounter with a native . " All right , Tenona , you shall look after me . I 'll be ready about eight . " Tenona saluted smartly , his tribute to the accomplished manhood of young Baas , and retired with the feline noiselessness of his race . But when they set out together it was noticeable that the black man observed the unwritten rules of Africa , while the white man did his best to upset them . Tenona walked behind , and a little to the side of , young Brown-law at the respectful distance of one yard . That yard between him and a white South Africa , between him and a native wife at his rear  --  such simple measurements spelled order and sanity in a world profoundly immersed in chaos and madness . Gradually the old police swagger dominated Teriona 's gait and carriage . Who could walk with Mr. Brownlaw 's brother 's child and not be dignified by the proximity ? Almost it was as if he walked again the good earth of Zululand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cane was tucked under one arm . " Look at this conceited nigger , " thought the people in the street . " How he struts ! And just look at his hat ! " They did not know , those narrow souls , that that rakish angle of the hat was that of the uniform of a famous African police force ! They did not know that the conceited one was walking in proud humility exactly a yard behind the white man , his friend and fellow-African . " Tenona , you must take me through some of the poorer quarters . I do n't want to stay in streets like this . I can see this anywhere . " " No , Baas , no . Young master please not go to those dirty places . Young master too ? " " Tenona , if you say again that I 'm too little to see the slums I shall  --  beat you ! Run away and leave you . Come now  --  march ! Which way ? " Tenona compromised , taking his way through not quite the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But even there a woman with whom unluckily he was slightly acquainted called out to him from a window : " Bringing me a nice customer , nigger ? Oh , the pretty boy ! " Fortunately the creature 's French was not of the kind taught to good South African schoolboys by their innocent English-University-bred teachers . But it offered no difficulty to Tenona , after three years of Marseilles . He refrained from the reply suitable to the dirty Jezebel . Any altercation in such a spot would not only enlighten young master too clearly as to the way of living followed by native Africans in European cities : it might also lead to a fight or pursuit in which every doorway might spew forth enemies . Therefore , Tenona 's ears swallowed the pursuingscreams of vituperative laughter without moving one muscle in protest . " The lady seems annoyed , " said Johnnie . He felt , in his youthful holiday zest , that he was seeing " continental life " as it should be seen , that he was an experienced citizen of London who knew his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live many bad women here , " said Tenona , spitting contempt into the gutter . In spite of the drawbacks there was an advantage in leaving the more respectable quarters of the town . Tenona was able to choose a cafe near the waterfront where differences in skin pigment were even less noticeable than in some of the grander places of a cosmopolitan city . " Shall we have coffee ? " said Johnnie . He saw that others were drinking wine , but his African training forbade him to offer alcohol to a native . " They make such fine coffee in France . " Seated one yard away from the table , Tenona gravely touched his forehead in consent and thanks . That good child of his old Master 's brother ! He would never give a Zulu intoxicating liquor . Tenona felt touched , warmed to the core of his being . How much grander was this than getting abominably drunk as he always did on his night out . Nevertheless , one does not drink even coffee with a young white master from Africa . Tenona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his . Even then he drank modestly , respectfully , sitting turned away , as if he tried to ignore the physical act of drinking . This was not lost on Johnnie but he had better manners than to break down the familiar etiquette , the natural barrier clung to with joy and relief by a homesick black man . " Tell me now , Tenona , what brought you here ? " " Baas , I am British soldier . South African Labor Contingent . " Somber pride , pride without exultation , deepened the deep African voice of Tenona : pride without the childlike conceit of the native who is under military discipline , conversant with the many flags , the drums and trumpets of military glory . That innocent conceit , innocent and gay as a child 's bright air balloon . " Labor Contingent ? But that was during the War , was n't it ? And now it 's ten years since Armistice . .. . I was sixteen or so ? At school . " " Yes , Baas . Baas big piccanin then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on some object just above the level of his friend 's head . It might have been a star hanging over the funnels of a ship that was lying some way out on the dark , gleaming water . " And you 've never been hack to South Africa ? " " No , young Master . No . Tenona never been again to that place . My heart is too sore , Baas . There is great pain  --  here . " He pressed his hand to his chest . Something seemed to be laboring there . As if , waking from dreams of flight , a captive eagle brushed the prison bars with his wing , raked them with an incredulous beak . Young Brownlaw sat very still . The hypnotic approach of the vision that held Tenona 's tawny gaze held his too . Through tobacco smoke he stared at the advancing unknown . " Baas , I have fear . I , a Zulu , hold fear in the breast . I fear-1 fear  --  the sea ! " Ugh ! It was out now . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry of shame . Such a cry as escapes from one who , stripped naked , is shamefully flogged . There it was ! As the pain jumps from a sick man 's throat in the shape ofa frog or a snake at the witch-doctor 's bidding , so leapt the leaden pain from the breast of Tenona . True , he had not actually seen the evil shape  --  only the witch-doctor can make evil visible ? but he had felt the sickening expulsion upward from the laboring breast . Tenona rose and with deep breath chanted the magic words of release from bondage . " I have fear . I fear the sea ! It is the sea I fear ! I have fear , great fear ! The water will hold me ? " Becoming aware of his isolation in a room full of staring eyes , Tenona suddenly fell silent . Abashed to have drawn attention to the fact that here was young Baas sitting with a black man , he lowered himself noiselessly to his chair , guiltily silent . " Do you mean you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirals carefully , as if nothing had happened to break the spell . " Collision is correct word , Baas ! We are collision . " Adjusting his voice to a lower pitch , Tenona took up the thread . " Baas , that water too cold . . " We play cards on the deck . We laugh and toss the pennies . Soon we are to get off the ship . All wear heavy coats . They are new and beautiful . Our boots are heavy but beautiful and new , like white officers ' . We are told soon to get off the ship . We feel cold but we laugh and jump . We play with those balls and rings the officers gave us . We laugh because we soon get off the ship and begin to fight for the King . Long way we came ? long , long way over much water . Some very sick . At first it was nice and warm . Now very cold . That sea not blue any more . Not enough blue . There is no sun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We are seven , eight hundred men . Some say even a thousand . We go to fight for the White King over the water . We are told many enemies have arisen . He has called for our assistance . Never before has our tribe been so full of honor . It is true there were men of other tribes , but we spit on them when those officers not looking . It is Tenona 's tribe the King asks for -- has not all the world heard of our fighting men ? Who has ever heard of the Swazi ? As for those Matabele , those Bechuana , they are filth and the sons of pigs . Those Basuto chatter like monkeys . " Baas , those officers would not let us take our knobk , erries with us . No sticks . No knives . And with many there is grave dissatisfaction . We have not been allowed to take our own weapons . How can men fight like men without the shield and assegai ? At least a gun . But we have no guns . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Those officers said , ' Give them no time to fight one another . Keep these men very busy , and then no trouble . ' Sometimes we must spit and feel very angry because no fighting allowed . We play cards on the deck . Every day play cards on the deck . " Baas , that ship stay at England long time . Those young white men , many young men who go up in the sky ? they land there . Not come back any more on ship . All safe . And , Baas , we are told much gold- one million pounds of gold  --  is left at England . Safe , all safe . Then all South African Labor Battalion must remain on ship . We sail again . We go to France ? something called Western-front . A very ugly ship go with us . They said , to save us from being killed . " Baas , it was too cold , that weather . Then a very large mist came and hid us from that other ship . We see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they have fear , they cry very loud . They bellow like bulls . We creep very slow . " It is too cold ! We walk very quick and stamp our feet on the deck . Our new boots make nice noise , but our feet feel too cold in those boots . Many take off the boots to feel warm . We say we dance to make warm . " Then a white man cry very loud on the ship . Other men in that mist cry loud . The ship bellows much noise . All those sailors begin to run somewhere . We say , Whattah matter ? ' ? Nobody reply . Very great noise COMES . . . " Everybody cry out and stagger . Some fall over . That ship trembles , she make funny sound everywhere . For one , two moments all very quiet . Everybody listening too much . . " Baas , then that officer come quickly and call out . He say Boat drill as usual . All places ! ' Boat drill , boat drill ! All run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice flatness . " Tenona 's voice died away . His eyes were set again in a fixed stare on the sinking star . Only for a moment . The urgent narrative went on as if there had been no hiatus in the flood . " A man say , ' What 's the mattah with this boat ? ' The ship stand up like there is storm . But there is no storm . " The ship bellows like imvubn. ( hippopotamus ) . . . . That ship cry too loud . None can hear to speak . " I hasten , putting on life-belt . All at once ship cry no more . All is quiet down there in the passage . I hear that little lieutenant from Rhodesia talk loud in officers ' cabin . He cry tears like children cry . He say , ' Not a quarter of them can swim . ' He say , Swim no good in freezing water . ' He say , ' They trusted us . ' Many times he cry very loud ? They trusted us ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That little lieutenant rush out with life-belt . Not weep any more . " All go on deck . We put on life-belts . Our men say , ' What 's the mattah with this boat ? ' I see men roll down to the deck-rail . Others fall . They laugh . It only boat-drill . White sailors ' business . . . . " Baas , that deck too steep ! On our side those little boats ca n't be put in the water for boat drill . We cling to railings . Little boats go up , up . " That officer call loudly through big speaking-trumpet . He say , ' Men , there is collision . The ship is rammed . She sink in water . We can only save if you listen . ' He say to climb out on ship 's side and we must try lower boats from there . He say uo pushing , all in order like soldiers . We listen . All very quiet while a man could count ten sheep . " My master , a few of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They fight to climb up on ship 's side . That officer cry aloud in the trumpet to keep order . Like soldiers , he say . Those men not listen . They have fear . Too much fear . Than Nadala , son of my chief , cries to us with very big voice . He very big man . Very great voice , like from the mountains when we cry the news . He speak good words to us , holding himself tight to ship 's rail . He speak Zulu , he speak those words again like Sesuto , like Xosa . He say , ' Brothers , we are going to die . Pass the news ! We are about to die . They say to us " Boat drill . " Let us show these white men we are not women to be fed with lies . These white men can not fight their quarrels with another tribe without our help . Now we see that neither can he control the sea when bad things happen . Brothers , we arc drilling the death-drill ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers ! Swazis , Pondos , Basutos we die like brothers ! Matabeles , Fingos , we are the sons of one Chief , we are the sons of our Father Africa . Raise your war-cries , brothers ! They made us leave our assegais in the kraal , but our voices are left with our bodies . Follow me , brothers , not one man hurting another . ' " Baas , the son of my chief he climb quickly up , he stand on the ship 's side . Always we hear men cry out below us , many men of our tribes cry out in the water . That mist too thick , we can not see those men . They cry very sore cries . . . We look up at my chief 's son , we climb quickly , not one man molesting another . We make loud song . Like the wind in the mealie fields , it travel swiftly . We stand on ship 's side like on a roof . We laugh ! We dance ! Those beautiful overcoats , those nice loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's clothes away . Baas , we feel warm without them . We dance ! We cry our war-cries ! .. . Those officers are afraid . They can not make us help and drop those boats into the water . That loud trumpet no good . A madness like battle is upon us . We are men  --  not British Contingent . Many feet drum the ship . We think we hold our assegais . We feel warm like the sunshine again . " My chief 's son cry to us to make battle formation . We obey . . . . Those officers cut chains . The little boats tumble into the sea . Some white sailors jump after them . Baas , that ship 's captain not go . Our major , that fat man from Umbala , he not go . That little lieutenant from Rhodesia , he not go . " They stand with us . Very stiff they stand . They salute my chief 's son . They salute us , the sons of a chief . " We shout ! We give those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Morena/ Bartel ' " Young master , that ship roll straight again before she sink . She spring up very quickly , like wounded buck jump up before he die . No man can keep a footing . We jump ! - jump ! ? jump ! ? like buck into the sea . We follow Nadala , the son of my chief . My little lieutenant he cry , Keep clear , men ! Keep clear of the ship , men ! . . That wattah cold like ice . We struggle . Many cry out . Someone holds my ankle  --  I think it ingwenya . I think it that crocodile . I scream with great fear . The ship goes down like imautru . I am pulled down , I am dead man . . . . - Baas , child of my master 's brother , I wake in a boat . One of those little boats too near the water . All white men look at me . All those sailors . One give me very strong slcokiaan in little bottle . One throw a coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where are my friends , please ? No reply . I say sharply , ' Where my friends please ? ' " All look at ship 's officer . He sit by me . He say not many saved  --  perhaps none but me , perhaps other boats pick up some of those men . He speak very thin , like he wants . cry . His hand is upon me . I cover my head with grief . I lie very still . I hear that officer say , ' That Zulu giant of yours saved a panic all right . ' He say , ' I think we need one like him in every ship . ' I jump up . I cry , ' Panic , what is panic ? I wanta go home . wanta go back , please , to the kraal . ' " My voice cry too loud . I feel alone when I hear its loudness . I try to jump back in the wattah , but those white sailors hold me . I whimper like little baba . The disgrace is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white men . " Tenona shivered . He woke from his dream , cast a bedeviled eye all about him , and bowed his head to the present . Oblivious of the staring wine-drinkers , who had felt impelled to listen to this story unfolded in a language they could not understand , Tenona 's countryman arose , crossed the invisible barrier represented by a yard of space , and laid a warm , awakening grip onthose respectable blue-serge shoulders . " You 'll come with me , Tenona ! Come in my ship , back to my uncle at Bashowe , to-morrow . I 'll keep the  --  the horrors from getting you . I know how . " But when he felt the prolonged shudder that violently laid hold of Tenona at the mention of the word " ship " he very much doubted if he did " know how . " Just like those wretched shell-shocks , he thought . Wandering about ten years , still looking for a way back to safety .. . . " Baas sees ? " gasped Tenona , wiping the sweat from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea has made a child of me . I , a Zulu , am fit only for women 's work . But young master not make Tenona go on a ship ? Please , please ! " He clung frantically to Johnnie 's arm . " Of course , Tenona , there 's another way for you to go to Africa . " Walking back to the hotel , Tenona was quite himself again . Johnnie spoke over his shoulder to his bodyguard . " And what 's more , I know a flyingbaas who would do it for you if I told him about you . A bans that came from South Africa like you and me . Rhodesia . " " Rhodesia ? Baas , that is where my little officer came from . Perhaps it might even be his sister 's son , or the son of his brother . " Johnnie followed the lead . A native can not conceive that the world is anything bigger than a magistrate 's " district " with all its intimate relationships . " Very possibly that may be so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would n't mind flying with hint , would you ? Just think what you 'll be able to tell them when you get home  --  that you 'd flown in the air across the sea . As easy as an eagle flying across a river . " BLACK Tenons jumped an extra step , lessening the barrier by one foot . " My Baas ! Tenona fly like an eagle ? Like ukozi that fly from krantz to krantz over the mountain gorges ? Or over the sheep in the lambing season ? " Tenona knew airplanes well . But not until he visualized himself in one did he realize their true magic , their immense importance . " Yes , just like that , Tenona . But of course that flying-baas will not be able to fly anywhere near Zululand . You 'd be landed in the top of Africa somewhere , and you 'd have to manage the rest of the journey . Africa never starves a man . Keep to the Nile first , then the lake steamers might help , and the big road where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home when you reach Northern Rhodesia or Nyasaland . It 'll sound near home , but there 's a good step between there and Zululand . I should think seventeen hundred miles or so . And two thousand or more before you get to Abereorn . You do understand , Tenona ? " " Baas , I am good walker . A man can walk in Africa , when the way is to his own kraal , forty , fifty miles from sunrise to the first owl . " Tenona leaped another foot nearer to the white man who also knew Africa as a child knows its mother . " Baas ! When shall I go with that gentleman that flies ? To-morrow ? Sunday ? " " Well , not quite so soon as that . He 's in England now and busy . It might not be for several months . I 'll have to write to him before I sail and tell him all about you , and he 'll write to you what to do and where he wants you to meet him  --  in France or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to cross the sea . " " Yes , my Baas , I wait . " All the divine patience of natural ULYSSES 2,75 things , of rocks and stars , of animals and wild men , rang childlike and trusting in Tenona 's voice . " Son of my master 's brother , I waiL ! " With those words Tenona sprang forward the last foot of the barrier . He walked beside the white man as child beside father . Like a great locust , but without the locust 's facility in casual , neat landings , the plane ran along the yellow ground . ? " Are we at Africa now , Baas ? " In the sudden peace after the uproar of the engine , Tcnona 's voice was a whisper , infinitely subdued . " We 're at Africa now , Tenona . All your troubles over . " The Rhodesian did not laugh at the sight of a black man hurling himself to earth , going on his knees in the dust of Egypt , scraping up handfuls of that ancient mixture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were water , laughing and crying , springing to his feet to walk slowly up and down like a man savoring his own farmlands after long absence . .. . There had been terrible moments when they flew over the sea . There lay his old enemy , lying in wait for the eagle-men like a crocodile at the drift . .. . Tenona had closed his eyes for a very long time . When he opened them again they were flying over land . What land it was , who shall say . All looks so different from the height of an eagle . Like those pictures called maps that hung in Mr. Brownlaw 's office . Then they had dropped lower . A river was visible and some remarkable objects like stone tents had gradually revealed their shape . Perhaps they were the dwellings of a great chief . Now they had alighted near a very large village with many white buildings . It was not anything like Bashowe . Then came men running towards them from some peculiar sheds . And a motor car came quickly along some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what shall I do with you now ? I must leave you . I 'm taking passengers back to-morrow . Sorry I ca n't drop you a bit nearer home . " " But , Baas , say this is Africa . I now walk to Mr. Brownlaw 's office . There will be no trouble . " " Well , it 's a long way . And through some very bad country , I 'm afraid . Swampy ground and forests . Fever , and so on . Sunstroke  --  you 've never been near the equator in your life and you 'll have to be careful to wear a thick hat . Then there 'll be elephants and a whole lot of other animals you do n't see in your part of the world . And the natives  --  they may give you trouble here and there . You wo n't know how to speak to them . A man alone going through strange country is n't too safe . " Tenona listened respectfully and made respectful reply . " Bass , what you say is very true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of my throat no harm will befall me . This sun is my father , the soil is my mother what ill shall befall me in the house of my father ? Better be trampled by that elephant in my own country than feel a sore heart in the white man 's places . Sooner would I fall to the spear of a strange brother than do women 's work in white man 's houses . But , Baas , a man hungry and carrying neither spear nor little gun will come to no harm in a stranger 's kraal . " " I believe you 're right , Tenona , " the airman ruminated . " If only I had the guts to come with you ! Chuck up contracts and check-books and see Africa on foot . . . . Walk in home one day . What do I know of Africa ? May as well fly over one of those relief maps for all that we know of it . By the way , you should have a map , should n't you ? " " Baas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa that 'll show you whose territory you 're in . You can read , I suppose ? " " Yes , Baas . But if Baas will draw in the sand a picture of how a man walk to Zululand , I shall see it better than on a paper picture . Never will it get lost if I see it like a picture in this sand . " Oblivious of the approaching squad of loafers and helpers , the airman drew with the point of Tenona 's little cane , a very creditable outline of Africa . Inside this he drew a few lines , explaining with each stroke what it meant . " This is where we are , right up in Egypt . And here 's the Sudan , and here 's Abyssinia . Now I 'll put the Nile River in , which will help you on your way right down to here . Here 's the Belgian Congo , but keep out of it , keep a bit more east where you 'll find English people all the way  --  Kenya , Tanganyika  --  they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhodesia , perhaps a hit of Portuguese-East , Southern Rhodesia , and then you can begin to ask the way to Zululand . " As the lesson went on Tenona 's face began to beam with joy and purpose . " I then ask the way to Bashowe . Everybody know Bashowe . All men know Mr. Brownlaw .

With a military , strutting walk he went in search of the Nile , mother of all Ethiopians .
