( See front cover ) <P> The difference between professional hockey and professional baseball is a lot bigger than the difference between the two games . In the U. S. , big-league baseball is 62 years old , big-league hockey 13 . Whereas baseball has two big leagues of eight teams each , hockey has one big league divided into two divisions-International and American-of four teams each . Whereas baseball 's annual championship is a World Series in which the leading team of each league takes part , hockey 's championship is not a series between the leading teams but a complicated round robin ( for a battered $50 cup ) in which the three top teams of each division take part . <P> Since no team is out of the race for the Stanley Cup until it can no longer climb out of cellar place in its division , last week , with only five games to go , the hockey season was at its height . In the International Division-led by the Toronto Maple Leafs , with the Montreal Canadiens and New York Americans struggling for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cellar . But in the American Division- with the Boston Bruins and New York Rangers well out in front-the Detroit Red Wings , in the cellar , were close on the heels of the Chicago Black Hawks . Thus seven of the eight teams still had a good chance to win , place or show , and the Rangers , famed for their spirited stretch finishes , were only four points behind the Bruins and battling for first place . <P> Red Light Parade . To the uninitiated , hockey , the fastest game in the world , looks like a haphazard melee in which someone by luck occasionally pokes a puck into a net . But professional hockey players , who are required to make snap decisions while speeding 30 ft. a second , have well-timed plays ready for almost every circumstance that arises , seldom make goals save by effective teamwork . Baseball had its famed **25;1504;TOOLONG combination , but every big-league hockey team has a forward line ( left wing , centre and right wing ) that functions with the precision of baseball 's great trio . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winks . Last week the fast-passing Rangers were leading the red-light parade with 135 goals , seven more than their nearest rival , the Toronto Maple Leafs . To the confusion of casual readers of sports pages the individual scoring heroes were two gentlemen named Dillon and Drillon . Cecil Dillon , Ranger forward , was leading the American Division last week with 20 goals and 17 assists for a total of 37 points for the season . He stood , however , well behind the leader of the International Division , 187-lb . Gordon Drillon of the Maple Leafs who had tallied 22 goals and 24 assists for a total of 46 points . <P> Saving Grace . While the goal-scoring forward line goes zooming towards fame and the two burly defensemen crash violently against their opponents to the cheers of the galleries , the goaltender , encased in 25 lb. of pads , is grimly occupied with the job of making saves . If one of his teammates makes a slip , it is too bad , but if a goalie makes a slip , it is a score @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he must be nimble as a squirrel , sharp-eyed as a hawk . And since a perfect performance for him is a shutout , he works for naught on the scoreboard.
