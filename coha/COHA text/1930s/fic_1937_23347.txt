- Z11.11:1 THE HAUNTED PALACE A STORY BY ELIZABETH MADOX ROBERTS ryl HE House stood at the head of a val1 ley where the hollow melted away into the rolling uplands . The high trees about the place so confined the songs of the birds that on a spring morning the jargoning seemed to emerge from the walls . The birds seemed to be indoors or within the very bricks of the masonry . In winter the winds blew up the hollow from the valley and lashed at the old house that stood square before the storms . The place was called Wickwood . It had been the abode of a family , Wickley , a group that had once clustered about the hearths there or had tramped over the courtyard or ridden through the pastures . From a road that ran along the top of a ridge two miles to the east , the House could be seen as a succession of rhomboids and squares that flowed together beneath the vague misty reds of the mass . Or from the valley road to the west , looking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be seen as a distant brick wall set with long windows , beneath a gray sloping roof . Sometimes a traveler , allured by the name of the place or by the aloof splendor of the walls as seen vaguely from one or the other of these highways , would cross the farmlands by the way of the uneven roads . He would trundle over the crooked ways and mount through the broken woodland to come at last to the House . Leaving his conveyance , he would cross the wide courtyard on the smooth flagstones , and he would hear the strange report his foot-falls made as they disturbed the air that had , but for the birds and the wind , been quiet for so great a length of time that it had assumed stillness . He would wonder at the beauty of the doorways and deplore the waste that let the House stand unused and untended . He would venture up the stone steps at the west front and peer through the glass of the side lights . The strange quality of the familiar fall of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had discovered , so that he would at last come swiftly away . The country rolled in changing curves and lines and spread toward the river valleys where it dropped suddenly into a basin . The farms were owned by men and women who had labored to win them . But among these were younger men who worked for hire or as share-owners in the yield . One of these last , Hubert , lived with Jess , his wife , in a small whitewashed shelter behind a cornfield . Jess spoke more frequently than the man and thus she had more memory . She had been here two years , but before that time she had lived beside a creek , and before that again in another place , while farther back the vista was run together in a fog of forgetting . She had courted Hubert in a cabin close beside a roadway . She remembered another place where there was a plum tree that bore large pink-red fruits , and a place where her father had cut his foot with an axe . Now , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a cornfield to play . Beyond these peaks in memory , going backward , the life there rested in a formless level out of which only self emerged . She met any demand upon this void with a contempt in which self was sheltered . Hubert was a share-laborer , but he wanted to be able to rent some land . He wanted to use land as if lie were the owner , and yet to be free to go to fresh acres when he had exhausted a tract as he willed . After the first child , Albert , was born , he said to Jess : " If a person could have ahead , say , four hundred dollars , and against the Dean land might come idle . . . " His fervor had the power of a threat . He was knotty and bony and his muscles were dry and lean . He had learned at school to write his name and to make a few slow marks that signified numbers or quantities , but later he had used this knowledge so infrequently that most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painfully , and writing , he drew his fingers together about the pen . His breath would flow hard and fast under the strain , his hand trembling . If there were other men standing about he would , if he were asked to write his name , sometimes say that he could not , preferring to claim complete illiteracy rather than to undergo the ordeal . " Against the Dean land might come idle . . . " He had a plan over which he brooded , wanting to get a power over some good land that he might drain money out of it . He was careful , moving forward through the soil , taking from it . When the second child came they lived at the Dean land , behind the cornfield . Jess would fling a great handful of grain toward her hens and they would come with reaching bills and outthrust necks , their wings spread . She would throw ears of corn to the sow and it would chew away the grains while the sucklings would drag milk , the essence of the corn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems , to build the sow a little shed against winter comes , " Jess said to Hubert . " We might eat the sow . I might fatten up the sow and get me another . " " She always was a no-account sow . Has only five or six to a litter . It 's hardly worth while to pester yourself with a lazy hog . " " Fannie Burt asked me what was the name of the sow or to name what kind or breed she was . ' Name ? ' I says . As if folks would name the food they eatt " Hubert laughed at the thought of naming the food . Names for the swine , either mother or species , gave him laughter . To write with one 's hand the name of a sow in a book seemed useless labor . Instead of giving her a name he fastened her into a closed pen and gave her all the food he could find . When she was sufficiently fat he stuck her throat with a knife and prepared her body for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being glad to have decisions made for her , and thus she accepted the flesh of the brood sow . Of this she ate heavily . She was large and often of a placid temper , sitting in unhrooding inattention , but often she flamed to sudden anger and thrust about her then with her hands or her fists . She did not sing about the house or the dooryard . Singing came to her from a wooden box that was charged by a small battery . She adjusted the needle of this to a near sending station and let the sound pour over the cabin . Out of the abundant jargon that flowed from the box she did not learn , and before it she did not remember . . . . Jess had a few friends who came sometimes to see her . They were much like herself in what they knew and in what they liked . She would look curiously at their new clothing . But one of them , named Fannie Burt , would come shouting to the children as she drove up the lane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day with remembered sayings and finer arrangements . When Fannie came Jess would call Al-bert , the oldest child , and send him on his hands and knees under the house to rob the hen 's nest if there were not enough eggs in the basket ; for the day called for a richer pudding . Fannie had no children as yet and she could be light and outfiowing . She went here and there and she knew many of the people . " Miss Anne mended the cover to the big black sofa in the parlor . . . " She would tell of many things  --  of tapestry on a wall , blue and gold . Words seemed light when she talked , as being easily made to tell of strange and light matters . Jess was not sure that Fannie knew more of these things than she knew herself since the words conveyed but an undefined sense . The lightness of bubbles floated about Fannie , things for which Jess had no meanings . Fannie had lived the year before at a farm where the owner had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call there , staying all day as a friend . " Miss Anne mended the cover to the sofa where it was worn . " Jess laughed with Fannie , and she scarcely knew whether she laughed at the sofa or at the mended place . She herself could not sew , and thus she could not mend any broken fabric of any kind . She laughed however , Fannie 's call being just begun . She was not yet hostile to it . She tried for the moment to stretch her imaginings to see something desired or some such thing as grace or beauty in the person who leaned over the ancient tapestry to mend it . The effort was spent in won-del and finally in anger . Fannie laughed at the sullenness that came to Jess . The sofa had come from Wickwood , she said . It had been given to Miss Anne at her marriage , for she was somehow related to the Wickleys . Laughing , Fannie tossed the least child and settled to tell again . Her tales would be , all together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and settling into new abodes . She was gay and sharp , and her face was often pointed with smiles . Or she would be talking now with the children and telling them the one story she had from a book . " Then a great ogre lived in the place . . . a thing that threatens to get you .. . a great Thing . . . destroys . . . eats up Life itself . Drinks the blood out of Life . It came with a club in its hand . . . . It was a fine place , but had a Thing inside it .. .. That would be when little Blue Wing went to the woods to play . She found this place in the woods . . . " " What was that ? " Jess asked suddenly . " What kind was that you named ? " " A giant . Ogry or ogre . A Thing . Comes to eat up a man and to eat Life itself . . . . " Fannie would be gone and Jess would be glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much had been asked of her she would sit now in vague delight , and she would forget to run her radio instrument while she saw Fannie 's bright pointed face as something slipping past her . The stories that had been told had become a blend of indistinct mental colorings that would drop out of memory at length , as a spent pleasure no longer wanted . She would reject the visit completely and turn to anger , thrusting Fannie out . Then , complete hostility to the visitor having come to her , she would set roughly upon her tasks . If the children spoke of the stories that had been told she would order them to be quiet . Some of the farms had lost their former owners . A house here and there was shut and still while the acres were farmed by the shifting men who lived in the cabins or in the town . A man came searching for Hubert at the end of the harvest to offer him a part of the Wickley place to farm . " It 's said fine people once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his offer . " If they 're gone now I would n't care . " " It 's not like any place ever you saw in life . It 's good land howsoever . " Other tenants would be scattered over the acres , laborers who would farm by sharing the crops . Hubert would rent the acres about the house and he would live there . " Is there a good well of water ? " " Two wells there are , " he answered her . " I never heard of two wells . " " One has got a little fancy house up over it . " " What would I do with a little fancy house built up over a well ? I ca n't use such a house . " As if more might be required of her than she could perform , Jess was uneasy in thinking of the new place to which they would go . She did not want to go there . " It 's a place made for some other , " she said . She could not see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not discover what they might carry in their hands and what their voices might call from the doorways , or how they would sleep or dress themselves or find themselves food . In her troubled thought , while she came and went about the cabin room where the least child lay , shapes without outline , the women of the Wickleys , went into vague distances where doors that were not defined were opened and closed into an uncomprehended space . But the next day Fannie Burt came and there was something further to know . The Wickley farm was called Wickwood , she said . Miss Anne 's father had gone there in old Wickley 's lifetime . Together these two men had made experiments in the growing of fine animals . Sometimes it would be a horse old Wick-ley wanted . " Egad ? " he would say , or " I 'm not dead yet ? " Another story running into a comic ending , " A good colt she is , but a leetle matter of interference . Look at her hind feet . " Fannie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was told imperfectly , thrown out in a hint and retained in a gesture , put back upon Miss Anne , who could tell with fluent words and meaning gestures . She would be sitting over the last of the dessert in the old , faded dining room . She would be telling for the pure joy of talking , laughing with the past . " Pappy went over to Wickwood . . . . It was Tuesday . . . . Came Sunday then and we all said , ' Where 's Pappy ? ' Came to find out and he 's still over to Wickwoodwith Cousin Bob . All that time to get the brown mare rightly in foal . And all still on paper . " Fannie would seem to be talking fast , and one thing would seem to be entangled with another , although she spoke with Miss Anne 's quiet , slow cadence . In her telling men would be sitting together in a library . One would be making a drawing of a horse , such a horse as he would be devising . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much as foaled . This would be old Robert Wickley , a pen between his thumb and his fingers . " What we want after all is a good Kentucky saddle horse , fifteen hands high and two inches over . Take Danbury H , say , over at Newmarket . . " " You take Danbury and you 'll plumb get a jackass . " " Pappy laughed over a thing once for a week before he told us , " Miss Anne 's speaking through Fannie 's speaking . " Pappy in a big tellen way one day and he let it be known what he was so amused about . " A man had come in at the door at Wickwood , a hurried man with money in cash saved by . He wanted the Wickley land on which to grow something . He wanted to buy , offering cash . " Do you think you could live in my house and on my land ? " old Wickley asked . Fannie would be telling as Miss Anne had told and , beyond again , the father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who came on business were let in at a side door . " Business was a Nobody then , " Miss Anne said . Mollie would be off somewhere in the house singing . Carline had run off to get married . Old Wickley , father to Robert , rolling back his shirtsleeves because the day was hot , and walking barefoot out into the cool grass , or he would be standing under the shower in the bath house while somebody pumped the water that sprayed over him . Miss Sallie made the garden with her own hands and designed the sundial . They made things for themselves with their hands . Bob Wickley sketching for him-self the horse he wanted on a large sheet of manilla paper . His grandmother had , as a bride , set the house twelve feet back of the builder 's specifications in order to save a fine oak tree that still grew before the front door . A man wanting to plow his pastures .. . " Two hundred dollars an acre for the creek bottom , cash money . " Wickley had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pappy laughed over it for a week . ' You think you could live in my house ? Come back three generations from now . ' . .. ' And egad , he could n't , ' Pappy said . " " Hogs want to root in my pasture , " Bob Wickley said . He was angry . . . . Miss Anne speaking through Fannie 's speaking , reports fluttering about , intermingled , right and wrong , the present and the past . Fannie could scarcely divide one Wickley from another . One had gathered the books . One had held a high public office . One had married a woman who pinned back her hair with a gold comb . Their children had read plentifully from the books . Justus , William , and Robert had been names among them . Miss Anne now owned the portrait of the lady of the golden comb . There had been farewells and greetings , dimly remembered gifts , trinkets , portraits to be made , children to be born .... In this telling as it came from the telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who danced along the great parlor floor with one named Mollie . Mollie was the wife of Andrew . She had come from a neighboring farm . When they danced the music from the piano had crashed and tinkled under the hands of Miss Lizette , Robert 's mother , or of Tony Barr , a young man who came to visit at Wick-wood . Down would fling the chords on the beat and at the same instant up would fling the dancers , stepping upward on the rhythm and treading the air . Mollic 's long slim legs would flash from beneath her flying skirts , or one would lie for an instant outstretched while the pulse of the music beat , then off along the shining floor , gliding and swaying with the gliding of Robert , until it seemed as if the two of them were one , and as if they might float out the window together , locked into the rhythms , and thus dance away across the world . " Where are they now ? " Jess asked . Fannie did not know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be Andrew , the one that was her husband ? " She was angry and she wanted to settle blame somewhere . He would be beside the wall . He would look at Mollie with delight . His head would move , or his hands , with the rhythm , and his eyes would be bright . Mollie loved him truly . Sometimes it would be the old fast waltzes that were danced , and then Miss Lizette and old Bob would come into it . Then they would whirl swiftly about the floor and the music would be " Over the Waves . " The young would try it , dizzy and laughing , or they would change the steps to their own . " What did they do ? " Jess asked . " I feel staggered to try to know about such a house . " " They had a wide scope of land , " Fannie answered her . " They burned the bricks and made the house . They cut the timber for the beams of the house off their own fields . " The House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legends of it . All the Wickleys were blurred into one , were gathered into one report . " There was a woman , Mollie Wickley . She was the mother of Andrew , or maybe she was his wife , " Fannie said . " I do n't recall . It 's all one . There was a Sallie Wickley . I do n't know whe'r she was his daughter or his wife . " " Iffen he could n't keep it for his children , " Jess called out , " why would he build such a place ? " " He lived in the house himself . " Jess and Hubert would be going to the place where these had been . All these were gone now . The land was still good . Hubert would be able to take money out of it . He would hold the plow into the soil and his tongue would hang from the side of his mouth in his fervor to plant more and to have a large yield . The people would be gone . Jess dismissed them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be coming nearer . In Fannie 's presence , while she sat in the chair beside the door , they came nearer to flit as shapes about her fluttering tongue while Jess fixed her gaze upon the mouth that was speaking or shifted to look at the familiar cups and plates on the table . Shapes fluttered then over the cups . Vague forms , having not the shapes of defined bodies , but the ends of meanings , appeared and went . Fannie knew little beyond the myths she had made , and Jess knew much less , knew nothing beyond the bright tinkle of Fannie 's chatter . " It was the horse then , " Fannie said , in part explaining . " Now nobody wants enough horses . . . . Now it 's tobacco . " Hubert and Jess came to the place , Wickwood , at sundown of an early winter afternoon . Hubert talked of the land , of the fields , growing talkative as their small truck rolled slowly through the ruts of the old driveway . When they had passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its former growth , they came near to the house . It seemed to Jess that there was a strange wideness about the place , as if space were spent outward without bounds . They went under some tall oaks and maples while Hubert muttered of his plans . A great wall arose in the dusk . The trees stretched their boughs toward the high wall in the twilight . When it seemed that the truck would drive into the hard darkness of the wall that stood before them as if it went into the sky , Hubert turned toward the left and rounded among the trees . Other walls stood before them . Jess had never before seen a place like this . It seemed to her that it might be a town , but there were no people there . The children began to cry and Albert screamed , " I want to go away . " Jess herself was frightened . " Hush your fuss , " Hubert said . His words were rough . " Get out of the truck , " he said to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jerked her out of her fear and dispersed a part of her dread of the place . It made her know that they , themselves and their goods , their life and their ways of being , would somehow fit into the brick walls , would make over some part of the strangeness for their own use . He had climbed from the vehicle and he walked a little way among the buildings , stalking in the broad courtyard among the flagstones and over the grass . He looked about him . Then he went toward a wing of the largest house and entered a small porch that stood out from one of the walls . " We 'll live here , " he said . She did not know how he had discovered which part of the circle of buildings , of large houses and small rooms , would shelter them . He began to carry their household goods from the truck . Jess found her lantern among her things and she made a light . When the lantern was set on a shelf she could look about the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door through which they had entered . Outside , the rain dripped slowly through the great gnarled trees . The rain did not trouble her . A press built into the wall beside the chimney seemed ample to hold many things . Hubert set the cooking stove before the fireplace and fixed the stovepipe into the small opening above the mantel . The children cried at the strangeness , but when the lamp was lighted and food had been cooked they cried no more . When Jess set the food on the table they had begun to live in the new place . Hubert went away across the courtyard and his step was hollow , amplified among the walls of the building . He came back later , the sound he made enlarged as he walked nearer over the flagstones . " It 's no such place as ever I saw before , " Jess cried out . She had begun a longer speech but she was hushed by Hubert 's hostile look . They would stay here , he said . It was the Wickley place . She closed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their living , being afraid of the great empty walls that arose outside . The beds were hastily set up and the children fell asleep clutching the familiar pillows and quilts . Her life with Hubert , together with her children and her things for housekeeping , these she gathered mentally about her to protect herself from being obliged to know and to use the large house outside her walls . She began to comfort herself with thoughts of Hubert and to court him with a fine dish of food she had carefully saved . The morning was clear after the rain . Hubert had gone to bring the fowls from their former abode . Albert had found a sunny nook in which to play and with the second child he was busy there . " What manner of place is this ? " Jess asked herself again and again . Outside the windows toward the south were the great gnarled trees . Outside to the north was the courtyard round which were arranged the buildings , all of them built of red , weathered brick . Toward the west , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up their home , arose the great house . There were four rows of windows here , one row above the other . The buildings about the court were empty . A large bell hung in the middle of the court on the top of a high pole . There was a deep well at the hack of the court where the water was drawn by a bucket lifted by a winch . Jess had a great delight in the well , for it seemed to hold water sufficient to last through any drought . Not far from the well stood a large corncrib , holding only a little corn now , but ready for Hubert 's filling . She went cautiously about in the strange air . She had no names for all the buildings that lay about her . She was frightened of the things for which she had no use , as if she might be called upon to know and to use beyond her understanding . She walked toward the west beneath the great wall of the tallest house . There were birds in the high trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wren was somewhere about , and the cry of the bird was spread widely and repeated in a shadowy call again and again . Jess rounded the wall and looked cautiously at the west side . There were closed shutters at some of the windows , but some of the shutters were opened . In the middle of the great western wall there were steps of stone . They were cut evenly and laid smoothly , one abovz another , reaching toward a great doorway about which was spread bright glass in straight patterns at the sides , in a high fanshape above . Jess went cautiously up the steps , watching for Hubert to come with the fowls , delaying , looking out over the woodland and the fields . Hubert had said again and again that this would be the Wickley place , Wickwood , that they would live there , tilling the soil , renting the land . Jess saw before her , on the great lefthand door , a knocker . She lifted it and tapped heavily , listening to the sound she made , waiting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light echo that seemed to come from the trees . Her own hate of the place forbade her and she dared not tap again . Standing half fearfully , she waited , laying her hands on the smooth door frame , on the fluted pillars and the leading of the glass . A cord hung near her hand and , obeying the suggestion it offered , she closed her fingers about it and pulled it stiffly down . A sound cut the still air where no sound had been for so long a time that every vibration had been stilled . The tone broke the air . The first tone came in unearthly purity , but later the notes joined and overflowed one another . She waited , not daring to touch the cord again . The stillness that followed after the peal of the bell seemed to float out from the house itself and to hush the birds . She could not think what kind of place this might be or see any use that one might make of the great doorway , of the cord , of the bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her own being until it seemed strange that she should be here , on the top of a stair of stone before a great door , waiting for Hubert to come with her hens . It was as if he might never come . As if hens might be gone from the earth . She saw then that the doors were not locked together , that one throbbed lightly on the other when she touched it with her hand . She pushed the knob and the door spread open wide . Inside , a great hall reached to a height that was three or four times her own stature . Tall white doors were opened into other great rooms and far back before her a stairway began . She could not comprehend the stair . It lifted , depending from the rail that spread upward like a great ribbon in the air . Her eyes followed it , her breath coming quick and hard . It rose as a light ribbon spreading toward a great window through which came the morning sun . But leaving the window in the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , lost from view for a space , to appear again , higher up , at a mythical distance before another great window where the sun spread a broad yellow glow . It went at last into nothingness , and the ceiling and the walls melted together in shadows . When she had thus , in mind , ascended , her eyes closed and a faint sickness went over her , delight mingled with fear and hate . She was afraid of being called upon to know this strange ribbon of ascent that began as a stair with rail and tread and went up into unbelievable heights , step after step . She opened her eyes to look again , ready to reject the wonder as being past all belief and , therefore , having no reality . " What place is this ? " she asked , speaking in anger . Her voice rang through the empty hall , angry words , her own , crying , " What place is this ? " At one side of the floor there were grains of wheat in streaks , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jess thought of her hens , seeing the scattered grain , and she knew that they would pick up the remaining part of it . They would hop from stone to stone , comingcautiously up the steps , and they would stretch their long necks cautiously in at the doorway , seeing the corn . They would not see the great stairway . A light dust lay on the window ledges . A few old cobwebs hung in fragments from the ceiling . The dust , the webs , and the wheat were a link between things known and unknown , and , seeing them , she walked a little way from the hail , listening , going farther , looking into the rooms , right and left . She was angry and afraid . What she could not bring to her use she wanted to destroy . In the room to her right a large fireplace stood far at the end of a patterned floor . There were shelves set into the white wall beside the large chimney . She left this room quickly and turned toward the room at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall doors opened wide . There were white shapes carved beneath the windows and oblong shapes carved again on the wood of the doors , on the pillars that held the mantel . Before her a long mirror was set into a wall . In it were reflected the boughs of the trees outside against a crisscross of the window opposite . She was confused after she had looked into the mirror , and she looked about hastily to find the door through which she had come . It was a curious , beautiful , fearful place . She wanted to destroy it . Her feet slipped too lightly on the smooth wood of the floor . There was no piece of furniture anywhere , but the spaces seemed full , as filled with their wide dimensions and the carvings on the wood . In the hall she looked again toward the stair and she stood near the doorway looking back . Then suddenly without plan , scarcely knowing that her own lips spoke , she flung out an angry cry , half screaming , " Mollie Wick/ey1 Mollie ! Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocked among the upper walls after her own voice was done . Turning her back on the place , she went quickly out of the doorway . In the open air she looked back toward the steps she had ascended , seeing dimly into the vista of the hail and the upward lifting ribbon of the stair . A sadness lay heavily upon her because she could not know what people might live in the house , what shapes of women and men might fit into the doorway . She hated her sadness and she turned it to anger . She went from the west front and entered the cum tyard . Hubert came soon after with the fowls and there was work to do in housing them and getting them corn . On a cold day in January when his ewes were about to lamb , Hubert brought . them into the large house , driving them up the stone steps at the west front , and he prepared to stable them in the rooms there . The sheep cried and their bleating ran up the long ribbon of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus the wailing was incessant . Hubert and Jess went among them with lanterns . The ewes turned and drifted about among the large rooms ; but as they began to bear their lambs Hubert bedded them here and there , one beneath the stairway and three others in the room to the right where the empty bookshelves spread wide beside the tall fireplace . The night came , dark and cold . " They are a slow set , " Jess said . She wanted to be done and she was out of patience with delaying sheep . " Whoop ! here ! Shut fast the door ! " Hubert called . Jess was wrapped in a heavy coat and hooded in a shawl . She went among the sheep and she held a lantern high to search out each beast . If a ewe gave birth to three lambs she took one up quickly and dropped it beside a stout young beast that was giving life to but one and she thus induced it to take the second as her own . She flung out sharp commands and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with the crying of the sheep . Threats came back upon her from her own voice so that she was displeased with what she did and her displeasure made her voice more high-pitched and angry . Anger spoke again and again through the room . She wanted the lambing to be easily done , but the days had been very cold and the sheep delayed . " It was a good place to come to lamb the sheep , " she called to Hubert . " I say , a good place . " She had a delight in seeing that the necessities of lambing polluted the wide halls . " A good place to lamb . . . . " " Whoop ! Bring here the old nannie as soon as you pick up the dead lamb , " Hubert was shouting above the incessant crying of the sheep . The ewes in labor excited her anew so that she wanted to be using her strength and to be moving swiftly forward , but she had no plan beyond Hubert 's . " Whoop , rouse up the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there ! " He was everywhere with his commands . When the task was more than half done he called to Jess that he must go to the barn for more straw for bedding . " Whoop ! Shut the door tight after me . Keep the old ewe there up on her legs . " He went away , carrying his lantern . Jess fastened the outer door and she turned back into the parlors . Then she saw a dim light at the other end of the long dark space that lay before her . She saw another shape , a shrouded figure , moving far down the long way . The apparition , the Thing , seemed to be drifting forward out of the gloom , and it seemed to be coining toward her where she stood among the sheep . Jess drove the laboring mothers here and there , arranging their places and assisting their travail with her club . She would not believe that she saw anything among the sheep at the farther end of the rooms , but as she worked she glanced now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It was there or it was gone entirely . The sheep and the lambs made a great noise with their crying . Jess went to and fro , and she forgot that she had seen anything beyond the sheep far down the room in the moving dusk of white and gray which flowed in the moving light of her lantern . All at once , looking up suddenly as she walked forward , she saw that an apparition was certainly moving there and that it was coming toward her . It carried something in its upraised hand . There was a dark covering over the head and shoulders that were sunk into the upper darkening gloom . The whole body came forward as a dark thing illuminated by a light the creature carried low at the left side . The creature or the Thing moved among the sheep . It came forward slowly and became a threatening figure , a being holding a club and a light in its hands . Jess screamed at it , a great oath flung high above the crying of the sheep . Fright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to curse with her voice and to hurl forward her body . " God curse you , " she yelled in a scream that went low in scale and cracked in her throat . " God 's curse on you ! " She lunged forward and lifted her lantern high to see her way among the sheep . " God 's damn on your The curse gave strength to her hands and to her limbs . As she hurled forward with uplifted stick the other came forward toward her , lunging and threatening . She herself moved faster . The creature 's mouth was open to cry words but no sound came from it . She dropped the lantern and flung herself upon the approaching figure , and she beat at the creature with her club while it beat at her with identical blows . Herself and the creature then were one . Anger continued , shared , and hurled against a crash of falling glass and plaster . She and the creature had beaten at the mirror from opposite sides . The din arose above the noise of the sheep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass continued to fall . Jess stood back from the wreckage to try to understand it . Then slowly she knew that she had broken the great mirror that hung on the rear wall of the room . She took the lamp again into her hand and peered at the breakage on the floor and at the fragments that hung , cracked and crazed , at the sides of the frame . " God 's own curse on your She breathed her oath heavily , backing away from the dust that floated in the air . Hubert was entering with a load of straw on his back . He had not heard the crash of glass nor had he noticed the momentary quiet of the sheep . These were soon at their bleating again , and Jess returned from the farther room where the dust of the plaster still lay on the air . Hubert poured water into deep pans he had placed here and there through the rooms . He directed Jess to make beds of the straw in each room . Their feet slipped in the wet that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was near midnight . Jess felt accustomed to the place now and more at ease there , she and Hubert being in possession of it . They walked about through the monstrous defilement . Hubert was muttering the count of the sheep with delight . There were two lambs beside each of the ewes but five and there were but two lambs dead and flung to the cold fireplace where they were out of the way . There were thirty-two ewes , they said , and their fingers pointed to assist and the mouths held to the sums , repeating numbers and counting profits . Lamb by lamb , they were counted . There were two to each mother but the three in the farther room and the two under the staircase . These had but one each . " Twice thirty-two makes sixty-four , " they said to assist themselves , and from this they subtracted one for each of the deficient ewes , but they became confused in this and counted all one by one . Counting with lantern and club , Jess went again through the halls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost the sums and became addled among the words Hubert muttered . At last by taking one from sixty-four and then another , four times more , in the reckoning they counted themselves thirty-two ewes and fifty-nine lambs . The sheep were becoming quiet . Each lamb had nursed milk before they left it . At length they fastened the great front door with a rope tied to a nail in the door-frame , and they left the sheep stabled there , being pleased with the number they had counted .
