National Editorial Association was founded 51 years ago in the interest of the " little fellows " of U. S. journalism : editors and owners of weeklies and semi-weeklies of modest , local circulation . The Association grew to include some 3,500 members , set up a Washington lobby to see that their cherished patent medicine advertising was not jeopardized , awarded annual prizes for excellence in typography , editorials , job printing . With Depression , N.E. A. fell on evil days . Some 1,000 members defaulted their dues and pessimists saw the end in sight . Last week a new lease on N. E. A. 's life was assured when N. E. A. 's Acting Managing Director William W. Loomis , publisher of the La Grange ( Ill . ) Citizen , announced to 250 delegates at this year 's convention in Poland Springs , Me. that necessary funds had been pledged by the membership to continue N. E.A. 's operations indefinitely . <P> Pleased , the delegates listened to greetings from Maine 's Democratic Governor Louis Jefferson Brann , raised to the presidency their Vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guide , decided the best editorial page in their membership was that put out by Charles Lendrum Ryder of the Cobleskill ( N. Y. ) Times , wound up their meeting by setting out on a 1,000-mi. boat and bus junket through the state of Maine .
