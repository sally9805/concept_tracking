MY NEXT BRIDE-Kay Boyle-Harcourt , Brace ( $2.50 ) . <P> Last week Author Kay Boyle published a book at least a hundred years old . No copycat , she simply revealed the historical fact that she and her fellow-romanticists ( Ernest Hemingway , William Faulkner ) have succeeded in bringing off a 20th Century Romantic Revival . Like their early 19th Century predecessors , they have rediscovered the romanticism of the neurotic .

When Sorrel makes senile love to her , when the colony breaks up in mutual recrimination , Victoria in despair debauches herself with one man after another , but never with Antony . Antony leaves for the U. S. on business . Victoria discovers she is pregnant , makes herself ill by overdoses of pills .

At 19 she went to France with her husband , has lived there ever since ( she is now 31 ) . Two years ago she married Author Laurence Vail , by whom she has " two daughters , one named Apple ( see cut ) .
