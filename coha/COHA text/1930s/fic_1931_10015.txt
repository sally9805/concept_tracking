White Bird Flyingdays , and Eloise went many times to the stairway with : " Laura , whatever are you doing ? Do get at some work . We all have to work , ? people in our circumstances , at least . If we were better off maybe you could sit around that way , but we might as well face facts that we never will be wealthy and able to enjoy life . " There are those who would have taken exception to Eloise 's statement . But that was Eloise 's philosophy : great wealth brought comfort and happiness . And having no great wealth , she resigned herself , perforce , to a state of no great comfort and no deep happiness . Laura would dutifully get up , stir things around a bit in her room and then settle down to the absorbingstory . It was entitled " A Love That Never Came to Pass " or " The Professor 's Life Tragedy . " It involved the unrequited love of a college professorfor a fellow member of the faculty . To be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a happy culmination of the affair , excepting the adviceagainst marriage freely given by a villainous unmarried roommate of the wooed-but-not-won lady , the former resembling Aunt Grace so thoroughlyin Laura 's mind that she felt a little guilty over the accurate description . On the third day of the composition period , the embryonic author grew so upset over the tragic affairthat she cried too copiously to see the pages clearly . It was in this state that her mother found her . Exasperated mother and embarrassed daugh-30A White Bird Flyingter took part in a dialogue which got them nowhere ; indeed , which only seemed to push them farther apart in their understanding of each other . " That child worries me so , " Eloise told John that evening . " Do you suppose anything could be " ? Eloise was pale in her earnestness ? " wrong with her ? " " Of course not . She 's a smart kid . " " But where did she get it . . . that foolish emotion ? Not from my side of the house , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility . . . the Deals . " John grinned . " The Wentworths are all so practical . Look at Uncle Harry Wentwort  --  orth a half million , if a dollar . " " I thought that money originally came from his wife . " John could not resist . At which Eloise closed her mouth with the unspoken eloquence she sometimes assumed , and John went silently back to his office . When Laura had carried the sad life story of the professor to a close which ended in a : grave under a weeping-willow tree with the erstwhile juggler of his happiness planting bleeding-heart bushes on the grave , she washed the visible liquid form of her emotion from her eyes , and went down to cousin Katherine 's . Katherine 's and Jimmie Buchanan 's new home was lovely and modern and smart , just as Katherine3IA White Bird Flyingherself was lovely and modern and smart . Its lawn was only beginning to emerge , pretty and green , from the recent dirt of the excavation . But the house itself was a finished affair from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and white incinerator . Laura opened the immaculate white front door and stepped into the hall with a little , " Hoo-hoo ! " She reveled in the sight of the lovely rooms with the gay wedding gifts all about , the inner doors with their sparkling glass and filmy lace , the mahogany and white stairway winding to the upper rooms , the long lovely sitting-room with the one end taken up by the fireplace and the open bookcases . No one was in sight , but immediately she heard a door open , and Katherine 's head appeared around the corner of the upstairs hall to be followed by the rest of Katherine in an orchid-colored underslip . " Oh , it 's you , Lolly . " That was Katherine 's pet name for her cousin . Millard , she had long ago dubbed " The Tribulation , " shortening it later to Trib , a nickname which half the town called him now . " Come on in and make yourself homely , Lolly , " she called down . Laura giggled appreciatively . Kathie was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , that was not quite the right thing to think .

" You 're the queer. 32A White Bird Flyingest little duck , " she would say whenever Laura venturedone of her mature opinions on any subject . " I 'm going out , Lolly , " Kathie looked down at her as she dropped a lovely orchid afternoon gown over her head . " Bridge at Mrs. A. R. Brown 's , that 's short for Ashes of Roses , I suppose . " Laura giggled . " My word , Laura , this little burg has as much going on as Omaha , ? that is , providing you count every church supper and every study club and every female tea .

" She was downstairs now , lovely and slim and sparkling . Laura thought she had never seen any one so gay and pretty . And she smelled like the violets at the foot of the old trees by the creek bed . She threw her arms around Laura now and gave her a swift caress . Laura was surprised and embarrassed beyond measure . So seldom did Katherinenotice her except to tease . " How old are you , Lolly ? Twelve ? " " Thirteen last week . " " Imagine ! Bless your little kid heart . Well , all I can ask for you , Laura , " she was suddenly sweet and serious , " is that seven or eight years from now , you 'll be as gloriously happy as I am. " 33fl White Bird Flying " If you mean getting married , " Laura said , with the crimson creeping under the olive of her skin , " I 'm never going to .

She shrank from the thought of placing herself in the pictur  --  anted only to look at others . Katherine laughed , " You 're a queer little duck . " She threw her arm around Laura again . " Well , I must go , honey . There is n't anybody here . My butler , maid and chef have all gone . They 're all one person , you know , ? I call her my unholy trin-ity . ' " Do you care if I stay and read ? " " Of course not . But . . . " Katherine paused in slipping on a white coat . " What makes you read so much , Lolly ? Why do n't you get out and do more ?

There 's old man **25;612;TOOLONG , Stay here , Lolly , and do n't squeak , or we 'll have to march with Sherman to the sea all afternoon . " 34A White Bird FlyingKatherine slipped out to the back door , accepted with thanks the beets all washed and clean , took them gingerly out of the old bucket with a rope for the handle , kept surreptitiously closing the door a little more while the old man was talking and finally escaped back to Laura . " It was n't Sherman . It was eatables . Knew some families further out on the prairie had a worse time than us . ' " Katherine imitated the old man 's high husky voice to perfection . " Did n't have nothin ' to eat . . . no money . . . last resource was to go out on the prairie ' n ' gather up the bleached bones o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a dollar a load . Nature is kind under her harsh exterior . . . . Always leaves somethin ' around . . . even if it 's only bones bleachin ' on the prairie . ' " Laura laughed . Katherine was so droll . But something hurt her , too . It troubled her to think of the old man trying to tell that to Kathie in her orchid-colored chiffon dress and her lovely white coat . It was true about the buffalo bones . Grandma had said so , too . Then Katherine , gay and lovely , left for the bridge party . When Laura saw the car go out of the drive , she locked the front door and went into the long living-room . But she did not read . She tiptoed down the length of the room as though even then some one might be listening . In front of the fireplace she stopped and looked up35A White Bird Flyingat the huge portrait which filled the entire space above the mantel . It was the painting of a lovely lady in velvet draperies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ string of pearls at her neck . In her slender tapering hand she held a hat with a long drooping plume . It was no ordinary painting , ? but an heirloom that had come to Katherine on her wedding day , ? the picture of lovely Isabelle Anders-Mackenzie , Katherine 's and Laura 's own great-great-grandmother . Standing there alone in the silent house and looking up at the lovely lady , Laura recalled all that her Grandmother had told her about it , ? how the lady had been an aristocratic Scotch woman ; how her only son , Basil , riding to the hounds , had met and wooed and won a little sixteen-year-oldIrish peasant girl on the Scottish moors , married her and taken her home to the great estate near Aberdeen ; how this lady of the picture had tried to make a grand dame of the little Maggie O'Conner , but had not succeeded , for the little bride would put on her peasant dress and shawl and run away over the moors to her own folks . Isabelle Anders-Mackenzie died , and the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slip away and revert to the crown . They had come to Americathen with their children , and Grandma herself had been born soon after they landed . It was only because Grandma had told about hear , 36A White Bird Flyinging of this huge painting that used to hang on the landing of the great house in Aberdeen that Kathie knew about it . She had teased her father to find it . Uncle Mack had set agents to work and though it had cost a great deal of mone  --  e never would tell how muc  --  hey had found the painting and shipped it to Katherine . That was just like Kathie . Kathie always got everything she wanted . She wondered if Kathie cared very much for the painting , now that she had it . For a long time Laura stood and looked up at the lovely lady . The lovely lady looked back at Laura . But Laura was the first to speak . " Isabelle Anders-Mackenzie , " she said aloud , and the sound of her voice in the silent lovely room half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isabelle Anders-Mackenzie gazed back from heavy-lidded eyes , her cupid's-bow lips smiling mysteriouslyas though she possessed the concentrated wisdom of all the ages . One could not conscientiouslysay that she seemed pleased at the news and approving of it , but neither could one justly contend that she was annoyed and distressed . She merely smiled that puzzling smile as though , sphinx-like , she knew the secret of deep mysteries . " I live in a little house all by myself , " Laura toldthe lady confidentially , " no one can touch me whenI 11 I am there . And no one can come in . " She wasenjoying herself , dramatizing the situation . Shecould see herself , a member of the fifth generation37161A White Bird Flyingbeyond the lady of the portrait , standing in front of the ancestor and confiding in her . " I hereby take a vow . . . " she went on . All at once it struck her that there should be some special emphasisto such a serious statement , some rite performedwhich would verge on the sacred . She ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite relish the thought of puncturing her own anatomy . She wished she had something that would make a good imitation of blood . Perhaps Kathie had beet juice . She tiptoed to the icebox . There were potatoes and head lettuce , pickles and pie and cold meat , but not a single red condiment . In the medicine closet her quest ended . With the cork from a bottle of disinfectant she went back to the scene of her solemn promise . " This is a symbol , " she said , touching her forehead with the scarlet-col. ored drug : " Laura Deal . . . I hereby plight my troth to a career . Nothing shall keep me from it . If love comes by , I shall spurn it . " She liked the sound of that statement so well that she repeated : " If love comes by I shall spurn it . . . him . . . " Of course , love had to be a him . She fell to wondering what he would look like , providinghe did come by . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not come by to be spurned . It made the tears come to her eyes to think how terrible he would feel . But she would be obdurate . Obdurate , ? that was her new word . She must n't forget it. 38A White Bird FlyingThe door bell ringing suddenly and harshly threw the author into something of a panic . She hastily drew a handkerchief from her blouse pocket and wiped from her forehead all pharmaceutical manifestationsof the oath of allegiance to a career . Her heart thumping rapidly , she tiptoed to the door and peeped cautiously out through the lace-covered glass . It was no one at all but Allen Rinemiller , dressed in brown corduroys and a blue shirt open at the throat . Allen had graduated that spring from High School and the captaincy of the football team . He was big and blond . There were three distinct waves in his close clipped hair ; his eyes were crinkling and jolly looking and his tanned skin was smooth and firm . She opened the door . " Hello , Allen . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first where all decent tramps and peddlers go , but nobodycame . You the hired girl ? " Laura laughed . She did n't know Allen Rinemillerso very well , but she had watched him lots of times at football games and heard the older girls talk about him , and sometimes when she had been at Grandma 's he had plowed or used the disc or picked corn close to Grandma 's yard , for his father 's land joined it . " Cousin Kathie 's gone away , " she volunteered . " What did you want ? " " I did n't want anything . She 's the one thatwanted it . Wood . " And Laura noticed for the39fl White Bird Flyingfirst time the truck in the driveway . " Dry elm wood for the fireplace . I want to know where to put it , but first I want to try a chunk in the fireplaceif I can , to see if the size is right . " Laura told him to come right in and try the chunk and she would phone Kathie at Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . So Allen Rinemiller , stepping gingerly over Kathie 's oriental rugs , brought in a huge chunk , carrying it easily on his stalwart shoulder . And when Laura came back with the message that the wood was to go in the south end of the basement , he had the screen removed and the chunk in place . " O. K. . . . if this one goes , they all go , " he said and stood up , looking curiously about him . " Gee . . . swell joint . " He was evidently appreciatingthe lovely rooms with their soft rugs and draperies , their attractive furniture , books and picturesand bowls of flowers . " Gosh . . . I 'd like a house like this . " Without apology , he walked back to the hall and looked out to the diningroom . There were lavender asters on the dark polished table out there and a big bowl of white ones beyond on the bench in the green and white breakfast-nook . He could even catch a glimpse of the white enamel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows . " Gosh , " he reiterated " . . . just about perfect . " " I think it 's nice , too . I like to come here . " Laura was glad Allen Rinemiller liked it so well. 40A White Bird FlyingShe had been in his house with her grandmother and knew that it was scrubbed to a shining neatness but terribly plain , straight wooden chairs , shining oak table and sideboard , coarse lace curtains ruffled and starched . When he was going back to the fireplace for the chunk , he stopped short . " Who 's the dame ? " Laura almost blushed in her fear that the lovely lady in the picture might suddenly open her cupid'sbowmouth and start to tell all she knew . " That 's Kathie 's and my great-great-grandmother , " she told him . And for the first time she sensed a rather snobbish pride in the aristocratic ancestor . No one could say Allen 's ancestors , on his father 's side at least , were aristocratic . Old ChristineReinmueller , his grandmother , was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never even learned to talk all English , but would mix her German words atrociously with the Americanones . They said Gus , his grandfather , who died a few years before , had wound rags around his feet for socks . " Her name was Isabelle Anders-Mackenzie , and she lived on a big estate in Scotland . My Uncle Mack in Omaha had this painting sent over from Scotland this summer when Kathie was married . And those pearls she has around her neck in the picture are the very pearls Grandma Deal gave Kathie for a wedding present . " " Can you beat it ? " 41A White Bird Flying " It was painted lots more than a hundred years ago , about a hundred and fifty , I guess , and the agent Uncle Mack hired had an awful hard time finding it . " Laura was surprised at her own talkativeness . After all , it was n't hard to talk to any one who was really interested in the same thing you were . And Allen Rinemiller acted interested . He asked her another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " Can you beat it ? " and suddenly came to the present with a cheerful : " Well , this 'll never buy the baby a shirt , " shouldered his log lightly and started away . At the door he paused . " Did you know I 'm going up to the University to school ? " It was the pride of the male of the species strutting a little before the other sex , even though the female was a plain brown wren of a girl . " Why , Allen , I 'm glad . Is n't that nice ? " Laura was genuinely surprised . Not many of the Reinmuellershad gone away to school . But Laura was forgetting something . Laura was forgetting that it was the Reinmuellers who seldom went away to school . And Allen , of the third generation , was a Rinemiller . " Is Verna Conden going , too ? " She asked the question teasingly . It still seemed slightly audaciousfor her to be talking to the big High School football captain . Allen grinned . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or something . Say , Laura , I 'll ap-42A White Bird Flyingpoint you a committee of one to keep an eye on my girl when I 'm gone . " Laura laughed at the frank retort . They talked a few moments more about the University , and then Allen went singing to the truck and the piling of the wood . For a long time she could hear the chunks whackingagainst the cement and a gay unmusical voice singing of a lady in a balcony in a little Spanish town . CHAPTER IVWHEN Allen Rinemiller left Katherine Buchanan'shome , he drove around by the Conden cottage and dated Verna to go down to Weeping Water to a show in the evening . Verna was pretty in a wind-blown fashion , with fly-away hair upon which a beret was usually perilously perched . She was gay and noisy , conscious always of her own vivacity . Her eyes were hard and bright , her generous mouth too scarlet . " Landed a job yet ? " No , Verna had not landed a job . She guessed she 'd just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ought to be her own kitchen . She believed maybe she 'd advertise for a man . Her hard bright eyes laughed at Allen . Allen liked he  --  e liked her a lo  --  ut whenever she talked that provocative way it made him uncomfortable . When he left her and started home , driving the little truck fast over the graveled roads , he gave her no more thought . In fact he was thinking of the home in which he had just been . He wished their own house looked like the Buchanans ' . There was something about it that you just absorbed into your system , ? it was so satisfying . Several of the mem ? 44A White Bird Flyingbers of his old High School class had homes similar , ? all low-shaded lights and cushions and book-ends and rugs that were soft as Turkish towels . He believedhe 'd talk to his mother about getting some new things . His drive on the highway was very short , only a half mile beyond the town limits . But there was another quarter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house sat back so far that one approachedit down a long private lane bordered by walnut trees . The house itself was plain , a white box so symmetrical that , save for the narrow porch across the front , it looked like a child 's huge cubicshapedblock set down in the exact center of the Rinemillers ' holdings . Old Gus Reinmueller , dead these many years , had come over sixty years before into the young state with Christine , " his woman , " driving oxen hitched to a rowboat on wheels with a dingy cover over it . They had been part of that great general movement in settling Nebraska . Bison herds , bands of Indians and wild fowl had held complete possession of the land until the first isolated settlements , clinging to the banks of the sluggish Missouri , made their advent . Indian trails then became trails for adventurers , Mormons , gold hunters , freighters . These were followed by the settlers with the homing instinct of so many birds of passage . Covered wagonsjolted over the old trails and made new ones through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flyingsteaders were of the old stock of corn farmers from Illinois , Iowa , Indiana , Wisconsin . Many more were of foreign blood . These latter , because of their common language and background , tended to group themselves in the same regions . Thus , KearneyCounty became predominately Danish ; Phelps County , Swedish . The Mennonites grouped in Fairbury , the Bohemians in Saline and Butler Counties , the Hollanders in southern Lancaster . All were highly efficient farming people . But everywhere came the Germans , equally efficient and thrifty . Of these were Gus and Christine Reinmueller , Allen 's grandparents . And a far cry it now seemed from old Gus and Christine to young Allen with his finer sensitiveness , his clear-eyed modern viewpoint , his flexibility toward all the modes of the times . In those old days Gus and Christine had built a dugout at the end of a ravine by digging into the low hillside , setting sturdy tree trunks a short way from the opening and covering the top with poles cut from the branches of the few trees growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid roofingof sod . Into this , with only the hard dirt floor and the one opening , they had moved from their wagon . For several years they lived there with their babies , like so many rabbits in a hutch . Gus and Christine worked early and late ; Christinein the field by the side of Gus , staying away from her man 's work only when her babies were born , proud of the small number of days she took 46A White Bird Flyingoff for those events . They bought almost nothing . Clothes were handed down from child to child . They ate what they raised . They suffered with the rest of the pioneers through all the long hardships of drouth , grasshoppers , blizzards , crop failures . They suffered with the other early settlers , it is true , but with one difference , ? their hardships were all physical . There was no suffering of the spirit , like that which came to the Lutzes and the Deals . They were stolid , inured to poverty , cared nothing that they were deprived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write one 's name on a receipt the only necessity for schooling . When money came in they hoarded it . They thought only of one thing . Land . Before Gus had quite finished paying for the first eighty acres of land he was contracting to go in debt for another . To enlarge their holdings became a fetish with them . Two eighties now . " That 's like paying for a dead horse , " Will Deal , his neighbor , had once told him . " Y  --  ead horse . " Gus had shrugged his shoulders . " But purty soon already . . . that dead mare she come to life . Ya ? " The dugout gave place in time to a small cheap two-roomed frame house in which they all huddled . They were up at four o'clock in the morning , routing out the children , too . The little boys husked corn with half frozen hands . Three eighties . Four eighties . ? Later they added two more rooms . The girls could husk now . Five eightie  --  ix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighties . It was across the road on this eighty that they built the white house as it now stood , large , cubic-shaped , as long as wide and as high as long , a cheap narrow porch across the front , four square rooms downstairsand four square rooms up . They bought more land of Oscar Lutz . Oscar was living in town now , merely holding his land for investment . Eight eighties . Some of the boys could work away now , the girls take places in town , and all bring home their wages . Nine eighties . There were no conveniencesin the house ; water was carried from the well in buckets . Small kerosene lamps made glowwormlighting in the rooms when , indeed , lighting became necessary . It was extravagant to sit up and use kerosene . " Get to bed , all of you . To-morrow yet the husking begins . " They kept the two front rooms closed . Too much fuel to have them open . " Keep hustling . . . all of you . If you 're cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get out at that milking . " Oscar Lutz still owned two eighties . Gus and Christine could not stand it to see the black loam across their barbedwirefence ; could not bear to see Oscar Lutz 's tenant plowing up close to their own holdings . They made Oscar an offer . " Too much he wants . For himself he say he keep two eighties . To come back from California summers and see some of his own land yet he wants . I no more ask him , " Gus had said . But Christine 's mind had harried her with land glut-48A White Bird Flyingtony ; her little eyes glinted with the thought of the ownership of the mellow soil . " Du narr . . . Some more you ask . " She had urged Gus . " A little more you offer . Go on . . . qvick . " And finally Oscar Lutz had sold . Ten eighties . Eleven eighties . No one in this end of the county owned so much . Only one boy was left at home at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknownreason , Gus and Christine had been a little more lenient with Herman . There had been a bit more leisure for Herman , not quite so much " Get to work . . . you " for the youngest . Herman had gone into town almost every day to school , riding his pony and carrying rye bread and sausage in a tin pail . They had only required him to stay out at husking time and for plowing . Herman had gone clear through the eighth grade , had even gone on into High School for one year , but Gus and Christinehad put an end to that foolishness . " For what good you think them Latins is ? " Christine wanted to know . And Gus had laughed , " Ya , Herman . . . that Latin make you pick more corn faster and bring you in more pigs . . . huh ? " So Herman had dropped the subject of going onthrough High School and had cut alfalfa all thatfirst day when his class entered as sophomores . But as time went on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so thoroughlybefore the god of Work . He had laboredhard enough , when he was at it . But he had done49fl White Bird Flyingother things too . He had taken farm papers . He had put a tin bathtub in one of the empty upstairs rooms , fixed it with a plug to let the water run out even though he had to carry the water up to it , had " slicked up " and gone to all the town doings , left the church of his fathers for an English-speaking one , had begun going with gentle Lucy Steele without a drop of German blood in her veins . About this last procedure , Gus and Christine had made a great many caustic comments . " Why do n't you get yourself a German girl ? " Gus had wanted to know . And " Ya 1 " Christine had snorted . " A stark . . . strong one mit some harte muskel  --  uscles . " And then , while Herman was still going steadily with the pretty and refined Lucy Steele , old Gus had suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipping up on him unawares , with no more advance notice than the scratch of a shingle nail . Herman , looking at the red wound , had wanted his father to go right over to town to the doctor . But Gus and Christine had said no , the doctors just took your money whether you needed any treatment or not and they would put plenty of fat pork on it to draw out the poison . But the drawing qualities of the butchered hog had failed to materialize , and quite suddenly old Gus was dead . " At the seedin ' time , too , " Christinehad wailed . " Mit the calves comin ' in . . . and all . How ve get-along already ? Mein Gott ! " soA White Bird FlyingSurprisingly , old Gus had made a will . John Deal had drawn it up . It had been signed by Gus and duly witnessed , ? signed with a cross and a notary public 's affidavit that the cross was the signature of one Gus Reinmueller . The land was left to Christineto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christine was the more crafty of the two . And old Christine had land then . Old Christine had her life 's desire . Lots of land . The boys were all on the various eighties . Heinie here , Fritz there , Ed on another , Emil farming two quarters , the girls ' husbands on others . All had bought more land of their own . All but Herman were getting toward middle age . They were hard working , well-to-do . Their homes were beginning to have conveniences , and they were sending their children on through High School . Christine deeded over an eighty to each of six , but gave two , including the home eighty , to Herman . Three adjoining ones she kept for herself . Then Herman married the soft-voiced Lucy who had gone through High School and taught a year , and brought her home to the cubic-block of a house , up the long road by the walnut trees . Old Christine had said a great many things about it . She had gone over to her neighbor , Abbie Deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ach . . . Gott ! " She had wrung her hard hands in distress . " Sale carpets on de two front51A White Bird Flyingrooms . . . mit green roses every t'ree or four feet already . Curtains by de vindows . . . mit ribbons tied back . Ndrrish . . . voolish . " " But , Christine , that 's nice . " Abbie Deal had comforted her . " You ought to be glad . You ought to be happy because Herman is happy with such a nice wife and that she is fixing it up so com-fortably . " But Christine could not be comforted . She had waddled in disgust back down the lane road at the Deals ' , her blue calico dress gathered at the waistline , angrily switching the dusty jimson weeds . Each time she had gone over to the Deals ' there was more distressing news to convey , ? the advent of a piano and a piece of furniture in the dining room she thought they called a " boardside . " But of them all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " mit de green roses every t'ree or four feet , " as though the multiplicity of flowers added insult to the general prodigal expenditure . Old Christine had lived with Herman and Lucy the greater part of a year . And then Herman , seeing that his beloved Lucy was ill and nervous , and that Christine was making her more so , quite firmly had moved his mother to a small tenant cottageacross the road , and had seen her comfortably settled there in the little house where the wastefulnessof fuel and the lavish squandering of money for kerosene need not distress her . That was the 52A White Bird Flyingyea  --  ighteen years befor  --  hat Herman and Lucy 's only child had been born , ? Allen . That was also the year that Emil and Fritz and Ed and Herman and all the rest of the Reinmuellers met together and decided to drop the superfluous letters from their name .

At home now , Allen put the truck under the shed and went into the house , looking about him with the eye of a critic . He saw the shining oak chairs and sideboard , the scrubbed oil-cloth , the rope portieres hanging between the rooms , the axminster rugs which had long since replaced the carpet that had so distressed his grandmother . He knew nothing was right . You could n't just get something new and put in as he had planned on the way home . It would n't improve things a rat-i-ta  --  hat was a cinch , he said to himself . The only way to go about it was to ditch everything out and start new .

For a moment , with eyes glued to the white card , he had a fleeting vision of driving past an aristocraticlooking building up at Lincoln the night after a basket-ball game at the University Coliseum . It had great cathedral-like pillars in front , and was brightly lighted on three floors . Cars were drawn up at the curb and fellows in dress suits were get-54A White Bird Flyingting in and out of them . There were girls in velvetevening wraps ? . He raised his head and spoke eloquently : " Oh , my good gosh ! " CHAPTER VM IRACULOUSLY , to Allen 's way of thinking , he was pledged Pi Tau and the aristocratic house with the cathedral-like pillars became his home . But Fate , that old woman of the loom , snapped the bright colored thread of her weaving in the spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Allen went back to the square white house at the end of the lane of walnut trees to take complete charge of the work . But something had happened to Allen . He was not satisfied , ? not with himself , not with the oldfashionedmethods of his father , with the machinery on the farm , nor with his limited knowledge of the management of the business side of it . To his surprise and deep mystification he was not even satisfied with Verna Conden . He lived only for the day when he could go back to school , ? could tie together the broken strands of the weaving and see the whole of the design . Herman Rinemiller 's death had done something to Old Christine , too . She spent most of her time over at the square white house talking of Herman , handling things that had been Herman 's , recalling childish anecdotes about him . " A calf . . . he vas56A White Bird Flyingsick once . . . my leetle Herman t'ought he vas todt . . . dead . Und @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . and ven ve looked out , leetle Herman'scoat vas all around de yard runnin ' . " She told it gently in pride and sorrow . It had come to her out of a harsh past , from the life of her little son whose boyish playtime had been given to work , ? a sacrifice on the altar of greed . Poor Christine ! She had long ago spent the days of her young motherhood in the market place , and now that they were all squandered , she had so few pleasantthings left to remember . So she crouched low over the dull embers of a few half-memories in order to warm her old heart . Lucy , Allen 's mother , was always kind to her old mother-in-law , as hard as it was to do anything for her . " You can come here and live with Allen and me now , Grandma . You know you 're as welcome here as though Herman was alive . " Old Christine 's pale blue eyes filled with unaccustomedtears . Two or three dropped down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good girl you are , " she said suddenly , and wiped the miscreant water away with the back of a red hand as hard as wood . Allen , always tenderhearted when it came to old people and children , seeing her unusual distress , added his own brisk : " Sure , Grandma , I 'll set you tip a little stove in the east room and make you a37A White Bird Flyingwood-boxso you can have your own heat and not depend on ours . " After which , old Christine tied a veil over her head , took her basket of eggs , and in her blue calico dress trudged over to town , went into John Deal 's office and gave Allen two eighties of land via a will to which so many codicils had been added that , with more amendments than body , it looked much like the Constitution of the United States . She signed her name with a cross , saw it witnessed , and trudged stolidly back to the farm in her blue calico dress gathered full at the waistline . High @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to any young person in the Cedartownsof the country , ? a period of youthful ups and downs , illusions and disillusions , of long-lived friendships and short-lived enmities , of study so interspersed with play that youth does not always understand where the one leaves off and the other begins . Laura 's achievements in those four years were of extremely varied results . She was the shining star member of all English classes and the dumbest integralportion of all mathematical ones . Composition ? Although verbally as noncommunicative as her father , she wrote reams on any and all topics with girlish abandon . Algebra ? Eloise , varying her home instruction with scolding , sarcasm , and plaintive encouragement , managed to assist in pull . ing her daughter through it . American Literature ? 58 A White Bird Flying iLaura had read and absorbed most of the assignmentsbefore they were assigned . Physics ? Her father , beginning with extreme patience to try to j44 augment the teacher 's instructions , admitted toward the middle of the term an inglorious defeat , and quite frankly worked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She read all the plays demanded in the curriculum , and all the others not so nominated in the bond . Plane Geometry ? John and Eloise together in combined effort , dragged , tugged , and pushed their offspring through part of that science which treats also of the magnitude of space and its relations , to a passing grade . Advancedcomposition ? Laura dashed off essays , poems , parodies , stories and biographies , both for herself and for such of her girl friends as stood in dire need of material assistance . Solid Geometry ? Instructor and parents , for once in peaceful united decision , gave up with calm resignation and allowed her to substitute something which , like that portion of her mathematical head , was not so solid . Laura was prettier now in her Senior year than she had ever been . Her clear olive complexion with its warm underlying pink , her brown eyes , the softnessof her well kept dark hair , the suppleness of her body , all helped to make an attractive whole . But Laura herself was odd . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an age when High School dating was the most important of the extra curricular events , Laura did not enter into the pastime with59A White Bird Flying A White Bird Flyingany degree of pleasure . She did not care for boys . Dating , perforce , meant boys . And because things that are equal to the same thing are equal to each other , it followed that Laura did not care for dating . Q. E. D. As skating companions , tennis partners , and members at large of any other form of out-door sport , she not only tolerated them , she liked them . But when it came to rear-seat riding , semi-gloomy-corner sitting , and all similar modes of entertainment , Laura was just not among those present . More likely , she was curled up in some cushionedcorner reading or dreaming dreams of her own . She was used to hearing people say she was odd . But for the most part she did not even care . " When Laura gets her nose in a book , she 's just dead to the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide awake about housework , either . She does her work mechanically as though she did n't have the slightest interest in practical things . At times I think she 's lazy . " " Oh , I do n't know , " John returned , " she 's young . She is n't lazy about things she likes to do . Maybe we do n't understand her . Mother always seemed to understand her so well . " Immediately he saw that he had said the wrong thing . Eloise 's firm lips gave an example of one of the few theorems which had been comprehensible to Laura , ? that a straight line is the shortest distance between two ppints . " I 'm sure , John , that 6ono one can understand a child so well as the mother who gave it birth . " To which conclusive biological statement John made no reply . He had long ago learned that it was less trying not to argue . And for that matter , he did not understand Laura himself . He loved her devotedly in his busy way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not let the subjectlie . She had to dig it up again and worry it around as a dog digs up the bone he has buried and stands barking foolishly at it . " I 'm as fond of books as Laura . She takes that from me as much as the Deals . But I do n't moon over them . I go in for knowledge and data and not the emotion to be obtained from them . " Eloise took a keen delight in her club assignments . For days before the club meetings , she would work on her paper surrounded by an array of text books and encyclopedias . She would write and rewrite , hitching a sentence from one text book onto a sentence from another in an intricate form of rearrangement , and read over the result with deepest pride . " When I go into a subject , I go thoroughly , " she would say , " I marshal all the facts to be ob-tained . " " Fact  --  acts . . . what good are just facts ? " Laura would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely words was infinitely more alluring thanall the facts of her Mother 's cherished club work. 6i8A White Bird Flying " Mother never wrote an original thing in her life , " she would admit to herself . And then in a sudden feeling of revulsion at the disloyalty of the thought , would throw her arms around Eloise , who , stiff as a ramrod , would submit to the hasty caress with : " There , there , Laura , let mother get at something practical now . " Eloise 's life seemed not rounded out . One may ' work at trivial uninteresting tasks and be neither small nor tiresome . But Eloise chose to dwell on the fact that she was doomed to a life of trivialities . She gave the impression that Providence , through some oversight , had neglected to place her in the way of a larger life , whatever that was . One inferred that having been formed of more artistic , less dusty dust , as it were , than the Deal family into which she had married , by some great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than they . She dilated long and enviously upon the fact that her Uncle Harry and Aunt Carolyn Wentworth had a great deal of money , lived in the East , traveled long distances frequently , and that by comparison , her own life in Cedartown was a constant sacrifice , but cheerfully borne . A card from the Wentworths mailed at Havana or Miami or San Diego always set her off . " Just think of it , some folks have all the luck . At least they have plenty of money which amounts to the same thing these days . Where will Uncle Harry and Aunt Carolyn go next ? They 've 62fl White Bird Flyingbeen everywher  --  ust everywhere . Japan . . . Philippine Islands . Imagine just packing up and going places like that . I have n't seen them for years . I do wish we could all see them . " To be sure , Eloise had other uncles and aunts but only these two possessed the golden aura so necessary to peace and comfort . In the former years she had harbored a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in her oldest son , Wentworth , inasmuch as he carried the family name , but for some reason Uncle Harry never seemed to warm to the subject of Wentworth via letter , inquired more often about Laura , when he saw fit to write at all . And now that Wentworth was in the South these years , marriedthere and settled down , Eloise had given up the thought of connecting him in any way with the affluent uncle . Laura , however , she urged to take time and pains to write to Uncle Harry . " How can I correspond with some one when I do n't know what they 're like ? " Laura would insist . " You seem able to write everything else , " Eloise would point out . " Why not to as important a man as your Uncle ? " " Because I have to know the kind of person anyone is , anc : then I can be like them . I can feel justlike anybody , " she explained . " I can feel like anold lonely person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flyingkind , and then when I get into the feeling of it , it is easy to write it . " Eloise often grew out of patience with her , and because she could not understand her little daughter , there were many trying scenes . And because there were many trying scenes , Laura retired more constantlyinto the privacy of her own thoughts and dreams . " I like to talk to people that nobody understandsor likes , " she confided to Katherine one day , " and make discoveries about them . It interests me just as it interests some people to dig for Indian curios along the Platte and the Missouri . " " You 're the oddest creature , Lolly . Well , what do you find when you dig into Old Uncle Lutz , ? buffalo bones and chunks of sod houses and skeletonsof those grasshoppers that et all the crops in 1874 ' ? " Laura laughed as she always did at Kathie 's light and airy chatter and her imitation of old Oscar Lutz 's high cracked voice . Katherine was laughing a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To hear Kathie 's comments on the subject one would have thought that the process of reproduction was the joker in life 's deck of cards . For in the tag end of the winter , with almost as much pomp and ceremony as royalty demands , Katherine 's daughter was ushered into the world . She was christened Patricia and arrived home from 64A White Bird FlyingOmaha a month later with the highest priced carriagein Nebraska and a nurse whose services , as well as those of the smart vehicle , were presented to the little Buchanan family by that unfailing source of all luxuries , ? Mackenzie Deal . Kathie , having given life to her child , proceeded to call the obligation square and to take up her countless social duties exactly where she left off . It was spring again , with Laura seventeen now , ready to graduate , and old man Lutz home . From March until the last of October the communitywould see him : dreamy old man Lutz sitting on the porch in the sunshine watching Cedartown go by , rugged old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thump-thumping on the walks that lay over the prairie where the oxen had traveled , grizzled old man Lutz laboriously climbing CottonwoodHill to stand with his hand on the gnarled old trunk of the cottonwood tree he had planted over a half century before , wistful old man Lutz thump-thumping along the graveled walks of the cemetery where all the old friends lived in their little narrow houses . He lived next door to the John Deal family so that Laura saw him often . His house was as old-fashioned as he himself . Many years before , the Cedartown newspaper hadcarried the item that " Our distinguished citizen , Henry Lutz , is moving into the beautiful mansionwhich he has just completed . This is now the finest65fl White Bird Flyinghouse in Cedartown , " and other descriptive matter in small town hyperbole . One year later , the same paper carried an item so similar that it might have been the identical one with the name changed , ? " Our distinguished citizen , Oscar Lutz , is moving into the beautiful mansion which he has just completed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If any sinister motive of brotherly competition lay under these items , no one of Cedartown 's citizens was bold enough to mention the possibility , for Oscar and Henry Lutz had been unusually close companions . If , perchance , there flowed any competitive corpuscles of blood through the veins of Martha and Sarah Lutz , the brothers ' wives , no one felt equal to the task of mentioningthat , either . And , in any event , Oscar and his Martha held the advantage over Henry and Sarah , for they waited until the latter had expressed themselves in a cupola and fancy cornices and gingerbreadrosettes , and then put on two cupolas , made the cornices more fantastic , and spiced up the gingerbread with what was supposed to be an Egyptian lotus effect , but which proved , when Asy Drumm , the local architect-and-carpenter , had finished the job , to look more like the heads of wild cows which needed dehorning . Laura in her pretty white sport dress was sitting on one of these gingerbread railings of the old man 's porch now . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 66A White Bird Flying " When Marthy and me moved to Nebraska , we . built a little pine and cottonwood house over there on the hill north of what 's the cemetery now .

Henry and me built together , ? that is , we all lived in our wagons while we was gettin ' his house ready ; as soon as his was done we all moved in it and worked on one for Marthy and me . Hauled the lumber from Weeping Water by oxen , it was only ten miles but it took all day to get down and another day to come back . " Laura let the old man ramble on with no commentfrom her .

" 67A White Bird FlyingLaura , listening , said , " Why , that 's quite a clever thought , Uncle Oscar . " And immediately she was thinking out a poem : " The little house was like a drum . . . " That was the way Grandmother Deal used to be , ? sort of poetical . She wondered , ? did living close to the prairie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner consciousness of the beautiful ? She liked to remember how she and Grandma Deal held the same liking for lovely things in literature . It was queer that an old woman like Grandma with very little education would like the things she did . There had never been any one since who could fill her place , ? to whom she could talk so readily . But she could not have held converse with Grandma Deal ten minutes without deep interest . They would have touched upon some topic attractive to both , laughed at some anecdote toward which they displayed the same sense of humor , winked back a tear over some happening about which they felt the same sympathy . Yes , there had been some deep and definite understanding of life in Grandmother Deal to which she herself held the key . She did not know what it was , could not defineit , found it impossible to put into words . She only knew that in this kinship , mortal or spiritual , there had been a unity of thought and expression , a oneness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unusual relationship between them , which had s-eemed so much more important 68A White Bird Flyingthan the mere relationship of blood , she made no attempt to tell any one about it . And because , even to herself , she could not put into the limitation of exacting words the vague yearning for something beautiful which life was to give to her , she thought of it always as a white bird flying . It seemed in some indefinable way to connect itself with the dreams and desires of her Grandmother . It was like a legacy from her , a benediction . She would say to herself : " Pain has been and grief enough and bitterness and crying , Sharp ways and stony ways I think it was she trod , But all there is to see now is a white bird flying , ? Whose blood-stained wings go circling high , ? circling upto God . " She knew that in some vague , undetermined way she was always to follow with wistful eyes this faroffsheen of silver wings , that by some unexplainable magic she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a white bird flying . CHAPTER VIND then , one day in the summer after Laura 's graduation , with no previous announcement of their coming , and as nonchalantly as though they were arriving at a large hotel to which they had wired for accommodation , Uncle Harry Wentworth and Aunt Carolyn , a chauffeur and a maid , came into the driveway . Cedartown is used to good-looking cars slipping unconcernedly along the graveled highwayswhich cut through the town . Indeed , Cedartown'sresidents , themselves , and the owners of the surrounding farm land close their garage doors on as many fine cars as do their city neighbors . But the Wentworth 's car , an audaciously long affair that sported more de luxe equipment and trimming per square foot than the most pretentious one in the community , made all the children stop their play to stare , and the old men on the post-office corner temporarily cease whittling out the affairs of the nation . To say that Eloise was upset when Uncle Harry Wentworth and Aunt Carolyn arrived is merely to make a trite statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is round . " And to look out and witness the descent of Uncle Harry Wentworth from that levia-70A White Bird Flying ' than of a car , was as devastating to Eloise 's poise as to have been an eye witness through the centuries to the entire descent of man . But not for long was Eloise 's mind a mental gyroscope . She took hold of the situation with heroic efficacy . By eleven o'clock , Aunt Carolyn was on the davenport with pillows under her shoulders and a cup of hot tea in her plump hand . Uncle Harry was in an overstuffedchair with a foot-stool under his immaculate spats and a glass of iced lemonade in his slim hand . Watson , the chauffeur , was in the garage rubbing down the car as though it were a thoroughbred horse . Annette , the maid , was unpacking . Lunch was well under way and John was being summoned home from the office . Laura was assigned the task of visiting with the heretofore unknown relatives ( although she had begged to fix the salad instead ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbor . Whatever faults may have been Eloise 's , she was not inefficient . Uncle Harry and Aunt Carolyn , having comefrom Denver , were now about to go up into thewoods of northern Minnesota . And so it cameabout after lunch that Uncle Harry , in as matter-offactmanner as though he were offering to take themaround the block , suddenly decided that Eloise andLaura and Trib were going , too , as their guests . " We 'll take them , wo n't we , Carolyn ? " All at oncehe seemed remembering to ask his wife 's opinion , 71A White Bird Flyingalthough Laura had a swift intuition that Aunt Carolynassented to everything . Uncle Harry was slim , debonair , pink-cheeked , his snow-white hair and snapping brown eyes forminga striking contrast . His hands were long and slim , the nails as pink as his cheeks . He was nervous , unsettled , never still a moment when talking . He rocked up and down on his heels and toes when standing , fidgeted about when sitting . He darted his bright brown eyes here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , too , seemed darting about in the same agile way , seeking something it never found . Aunt Carolyn was a complete antithesis . Physically fat , shapeless , and two-chinned , her mind also seemed fat , shapeless and two-chinned . She answered questions slowly if at all . Much of the time she merely smiled in answer to Uncle Harry 's rather exaggerated statements . Having been left behind on most of her husband 's mental flights , apparently she had now given up the breathless pursuit and settled back in obese complacency . Eloise was delighted with the invitation but unable to see how it could be done . Uncle Harry assumedall details of the plan . The front seat was wide , ? he and Watson and Annette could all three sit there very comfortably , Aunt Carolyn and Eloise in the back seat , Trib and Laura on the adjustable ones . They would start early the next morning , get to Okoboji for lunch , Minneapolis by night , and the 72A White Bird Flyingsecond day easily reach the north woods hotel to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make their stay longer in Cedartown , but apparentlyUncle Harry , having thought of the new scheme , wanted to carry it out immediately . He seesawedup and down on his slim immaculate shoes , waved his hands in illustrative gesticulation , winked a roguish eye at Laura , chucked her under the chin , sat down and tapped the chair arms , stood up and rubbed his hands together in nervous glee . Aunt Carolyn lay shapelessly among the pillows of thedavenport and smiled steadily without effort . To Uncle Harry 's sudden inspiration that Johngo up on the train and meet them , Laura 's father only shook his head and named two or three importantreasons for not doing so , ? the Blackman estate , a guardianship case , preparation for the schoolboard suit . Uncle Harry looked at John Deal with something akin to curiosity . Here was a man who seemed irrevocably tied by a hundred chains to a desk . For a brief moment he might have been wondering how it would seem not to be able to go where he wished , whenever he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another tangent . When it was decided that they were really to go , Eloise rose to the management of the preparations like a bass to the lure . Her efficient brain pigeonholedevery activity of the household . Trib was to ride on his bicycle and give certain instructions to the woman who did cleaning for her . Laura was todeleted linesof the cares that harassed him . He was like the old man of the sea , ? the burdens of the community the bundle on his back . It was a gay lark to glide along the country in Uncle Harry Wentworth 's great car . Uncle Harry sat with Annette and the chauffeur , a young married couple . He had his arm on the back of the seat and sometimes he would touch the back of Annette 's white neck with his nervous slim fingers . Once Aunt Carolyn said , " Annette , if you 're crowded , you can come back here . " Much of the time he was turned around talking excitedly to Laura and Trib who sat on the smaller extra seats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She sat quietly with the little fixed smile on her fat face . Laura stole surrep , titious glances at her sometimes and wondered just what she was thinking . Did she enjoy her husband 's nervous chatter ? Did she approve of his extravagantstatements ? Did the little fixed smile mean she was happy ? Or was it a mask ? Sometimes she went to sleep for a few moments , her head against the gay cushions , and the smile vanished , so that her plump face looked flabby and sad . Laura , stealing a covert glance at her then , tried to picture her in anotherenvironment , and invariably she saw her in a washable house dress and big white apron , her plump hands , white with flour , making cookies for hungry little grandchildren . It was a foolish notion , Laura told herself , but it seemed the setting in which she really belonged , rather than the present one of trav-76A White Bird Flyingeling about the country in the palatial car with her silver-mounted luggage and her maid . It made Laura think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It was queer what clothes and setting did to one . She pictured Katherine Buchanan in sleazy cheap clothes , and her own father as a section boss in overalls , thought of Allen Rinemiller in his collegiate-looking suits and hats since he had been to the University . The group of travelers stopped for a little time by the shores of Storm Lake and again at Okoboji and Spirit Lakes . Laura and Trib were charmed beyond words . Children of eastern Nebraska , they had known intimately only the Missouri and the Platte and a small lake or two . There was a night in Minneapolis at a big hotel , with Uncle Harry in his breezy way creating a stirand commotion in getting settled when there was noneed of either , and then the long trip to the northlakes . At the first odor of pines and the first sightof white birches bending above blue waters , Laurafelt that old emotional uplift she always experiencedwhen drinking in a new atmosphere . Immediatelyshe was reveling in the " feel " of the setting ; picturingsleek-haired Indian maidens and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palm itched for the touch of a pencil and , because she had no means of putting down her emotionaldisturbances just then , she sat for a long time77A White Bird Flyingsaying nothing , but mentally composing snatches of description and bits of verse . The two weeks spent there at the rustic hotel were by way of being a bit of heaven both to seventeen-year-oldLaura and thirteen-year-old Trib . The white birches drinking forever from glass-clear waters , the tall pines massed against sapphire skies , the clear spongy carpet of sweet-smelling needles , all filled Laura with the poetry of living that she always experienced when everything was " just right . " Trib 's sensations were not of a poetical type . The motorboat at the dock , the box of lures , the rods and reels for which Uncle Harry arranged , constituted a large part of his own particular joy of living . The mornings were spent in fishing , up the long lake in the motorboats , casting for the sporty bass or trolling for the common pike , with the hope alwayspresent of getting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again at four , when the water was full of young people and old with water-wings and joy balls . After dinner , cards for the older people , dancing for the young , inside the hotel or on the screened-in porches into which the mosquitoes could only gaze hungrily . Aunt Carolyn and Eloise settled themselves each night for bridge . But Uncle Harry danced , always with the prettiest and youngest girls . Sometimes Aunt Carolyn , calm and placid , watching the dancers , would send for him . She wanted a silk shawl or 78fl White Bird Flyingwould he please go and see whether Watson had looked over the car in preparation for the trip tomorrow . It seemed queer to Laura . She could not quite sense what was wrong . Aunt Carolyn was pleasant . Uncle Harry punctilious in attendance . But something was not just right . " Is Aunt Carolyn lots older than Uncle Harry ? " she asked her mother once . " Goodness , no " . . . Eloise laughed , " he 's anywaytwo years older , ? maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for having the same wife all these years , Laura . " Well , why should n't he , Laura wondered . Why was that any credit to him ? She thought about it a great deal . It worried her , ? the something which was not right , ? but she could not quite put her fingeron the defect . It was a queer marriage , ? Uncle Harry , gay and slim and debonair , sipping the tips of the blossoms of pleasure , Aunt Carolyn , fat and old-lady-like and settled , drinking her tea and cuddlingher hot-water bottle . Laura thought often of her father down home , working at the desk . She felt a great pity for him that he could not be up here , too . She wished he could do something that would make him happy and care-free and boyish . Working and working for other people without a great deal of compensation , always on the town council and the school board , always assigned to church and civic committees , his tasks never finished , a rest never earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but not being able to , she did the next best thin  --  he sympathized with him , writing a note every day telling him of all their activities , never failing to add " I wish you were here , too . " She did not know that her father put them all away in a private drawer in his desk where they stayed for years . John Deal in his silent way loved his young daughter deeply . It seemed queer to John Deal to live alone in the empty house . He missed the lively chatter of the children and Eloise 's good housekeeping . He scarcely knew what to do with himself on the few free evenings which were his . Sometimes he read , and for one whole evening he sat in a big chair in the living room and dozed or looked at the group on the mantel . Many a descendant of some old sea captain has above his fireplace a miniature brig with sails bravely flying , to which he points with pride as the traditionalembodiment of the spirit of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mantel , the oxen molded in the act of drawing it , wellformedand life-like , their huge horns tipped realisticallywith brass knobs . Eloise had protested the advent of the piece . There was no covered-wagon episode in the life of Eloise 's parents , she said . Her people had originallycome over in the Mayflower ( at which John had surreptitiously grinned and mumbled something that sounded like " poor old over-loaded boat " ) , 8oit White Bird Flyingthey had always remained city people and easterners , for that matter , until her own father came to Iowa . She did n't think the huge clumsy bronze thing looked in place in what she had tried to make an exceptionallydainty room . If the statue were something graceful , now , a deer , or even the long sinuous lines of grayhounds ; but oxen , ? huge and dull-looking and stolid , ? and a wagon with every flapping piece of canvas molded in the bronze . She had said a great deal about the price , too . " Bronz  --  hy bronze is terribly expensive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? I 'll wager anything , we could n't afford it . " As a matter of fact , he should n't have afforded it . Eloise was right about that . It had cost an evenhundred dollars , the entire fee of a client . But he11had been attracted by it as he was waiting for Laura to make a small purchase ; had stood for a long time before the little group , coveted it with a good healthy covetousness ; had thought about it many times and finally gone back to get it , half in hopes that it was gone , half worried for fear it was . He liked to look up at it as he smoked , forgetting the petty quarrels of his country clients in remembering some of the tales his people had told him . Their lives seemed hard in retrospect , but after all , there had been something free and untrammeled about them , like the winds that blew over their prairie home .

He remembered just how the old soddie looked , ? he must have been eight or nine when they moved from it into the frame house . He could close his eyes and visualize the one main living room with the general bedroom off of it , the cookstove where they sometimes burned corn , and the deep seats in the two windows formed by the width of the sod strips . He could see his cheery mother at her endless task of mending the clothes , his big strong father coming in with the milk pails , smell the odor of cornmeal cooking , hear the never-ceasing wind blowing against the little soddie . Here he sat now in comparative comfort , complete luxury even , if likened to the soddie ; and yet his problems seemed more difficult than his father 's . He wondered why , with all the added comforts , there had been no lessening of worries . Sometimes , the difficult questions confronting him seemed more than humanity could solve . There had been the question of defending the guaranty law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the depositorsin the failed banks heavy upon him . He had the story of old Mr. and Mrs. Kleinman losing their life savings ringing in his ears ; the pitiful tale of Amy Hall , the little seamstress , saving a dollar or two a week for twenty years only to see it swept away ; almost on his own cheeks the tears of young Mrs. Wise who had ? deposited her husband 's insur-82A White Bird Flyingance money just before the crash . How could he have gone up to the legislature and not fought to the finish for a fund with which to reimburse these ? It had made Mack angry . Mack and the other bankers were lying down on further taxation . Alreadythey had paid out several million dollars . " Poured it in a rat hole " Mack had said . For the fund was insolvent . Weak banks had been allowed to run on when it was known they were weak . Crackingdown on the first few would have saved the many , he had thought . " The trouble was long before that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and start a bank where two roads crossed , if they had ten dollars and a blank book and a pencil . " The whole thing had been bungled . People had been led to think the state was solidly behind their deposits . Then came the land slump , depression , banks crumbling , ? good bankers were required to pay for the sins of the poor ones . It made a vicious circle . Mack and the others had rebelled . Confiscatory they called it . Unconstitutional . " No state has a right to take one man 's property to pay another man 's debts . " Mack had said it a hundred times . They had argued hotl  --  rother against brother . " But you did n't call it confiscating when you were playing it up big in your ads . Now that it 's a heavy burden you 've changed your mind . " They had grown hot in their arguments , ? had lost their former comradeship . Civil war in the Deal family. 83A White Bird FlyingWell , it was n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of what to do now . How to compromise . How to fight to get back old Mr. and Mrs. Kleinman 's money with which to bury them , and sickly Amy Hall 's savings and young Mrs. Wise 's only fund for herself and two babies , ? and at the same time keep the other banks solvent , ? keep the whole system from crashing with a far greater catastrophe than the present one . He would go over and over it , silent , brooding , with a deep feeling of compassion for them all . Life was like the old plains before the trails were made . It took initiative and foresight to find one 's way through it . The old plainsmen moved through an uncharted region with only the sun and the stars for guidance . Their children and their children 's children moved now through just as uncharted a wilderness . If only the stars and the sun could guide them , too . Sometimes he would look up to the exquisitely done bronze on the mantel and feel a touch of mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made him realize that every age has its long tiresomejourney . Sometimes it is an endless lurching over miles of dry grass and sunflowers , and the breaking of raw prairie sod . And sometimes it is an endless fighting for the peace and comfort ' of fellow men . He was glad he had bought the bronze . CHAPTER VIIIAURA and her mother seemed in some inexplicableway to draw closer together in spirit there in the north so many miles from home . Sometimesthey walked together through the needlecarpetedwoods . Once they came upon the remains of a tepee set high upon the bluffs , so that Laura was transported in fancy to the days when Indians lived by the lake . She was deep in an emotional retrospectionof the time , when Eloise called practically : " No , Laura ; look here . It 's of recent date . The poles at the top are bound together with a patented wire . Scouts or Hi-Y boys ! No Indian ever put those poles together . " Laura had to admit defeat . But why could n't Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these walks that Laura approached a subject long on her mind . She did n't want to go to the University ; not at all . The University seemed so huge with its six or seven thousandstudents on the one campus . It frightened her , the very thought of it . Could n't she stay home and read and write ? She 'd make good use of her time . Really , she would . But Eloise was firm . " It 's just what you need , Laura . Mother knows best . You need to mix with85A White Bird Flyingpeople . This is a practical world we live in . You 'll just have to shake yourself out of that dreamy way of yours . " It hung over like a menacing thing ; she wished she could stay forever in her blue and white room or out in the grape arbor . The middle of September grew to seem as threatening as some date of impendingdisaster . " Sometimes , Laura , I think you 're a nineteenthcenturygirl in a twentieth-century setting , " her mother said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , Laura threw off the thought of the dread change , preferring to live in the happy present and make the most of her pleasures . And then , in the midst of the other excitements , as though her experiences were not sufficient for happiness , she met Miss Westcote , ? Miss Evelyn Westcote , the writer . Miss Westcote and a friend had a cottage where the pines tapped on the roof and inquisitive squirrels ran nimbly around the chimney . To one in Laura 's state of mind concerningwriting , the place seemed hallowed ground and Miss Westcote a goddess who had lost her way between Olympus and some Utopia . She spent every moment near Miss Westcote that propriety allowed . Sometimes she walked past her cottage with scarcely a glance in that direction , so that she might not seem to be thrusting her presence upon the writer . If Miss Westcote was the first to notice and invite her 86A White Bird Flyingin , Laura lived in a heaven of bliss . She could not understand , though , why Miss Westcote seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book like The Chime of Bells and not talk about it ? She ventured to ask her one day . Miss Westcotelaughed in her merry way , the lids of her eyes crinkling . " For the same reason that the candy manufacturer does n't stand and eat his own candy . We all like to get away from our business and forgetit . " " But , Miss Westcote , ? it is n't like a business , surely . " Laura was surprised , a little disillusioned . " I thought it was . . . oh , always inspirational , you know . " Miss Westcote suddenly sobered . " I rather think it always is , when one is very young . But oh , my dear , " she added , " for such a short time does one stay young . " Eloise , too , was delighted to meet Miss Westcote . Was she not to review one of Miss Westcote 's novels in club that very fall ? She was jubilant about the fact that they were to be thrown together for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said to Laura . " I can question her all about it and get my informationfirst hand . The ladies will certainly sit up and take notice of that . " " But , Mother , " Laura was diffident about the matter . " She 's here on a vacation . She 's resting and playing around . Maybe she would n't relish an interview . " 87A White Bird FlyingBut Eloise knew better . " You ca n't tell me , " she affirmed , " I 'll wager there never was an author yet who did n't like to talk about himself and his books . I shall ask her beforehand of course . This is really an opportunity that I could n't have dreamed would happen . " Miss Westcote was quite gracious about the inter , view . She would be glad to tell Mrs. Deal any time about the writing of the novel . Eloise and Laura drove over to Silver Lake Corners before the interview to buy a notebook for the occasion . A fat man in a straw hat waited upon Eloise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs . People were buying fishlines , sinkers , rods , lures , ice-cream cones , movie magazines and pop , getting their mail , and sending postcards of pigmy-looking people nonchalantly holding up twentyfivepound muscallonge . From the Corners they drove straight to Miss Westcote 's cottage where they found her sitting in a long deck-chair busily engaged in doing nothing but gazing out on the lake whose waves danced under a golden shimmer in the afternoon sun . She rose to meet the two , pulled other lounging chairs forward , and slipped back comfortably into her own . Laura , too , made herself comfortable . But not so Eloise . She sat upright on the edge of her chair , pencil poised over the notebook , and the interview was on . " My first question comes under the head of 88A White Bird FlyingAuthor 's Motive ' , " Eloise said pleasantly , briskly , " Miss Westcote , why did you write The Chime of Bells ? " " Well , " Miss Westcote said pleasantly , but not briskly , " you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all authors possess in common , ? at least , after the first fine thrill of writing to reform the world is over and they have settled down to make a business of it . They would like to sidestepthe issue , and most of them do . " " And what is that ? " Eloise was ready to write the answer verbatim . Miss Westcote 's eyes twinkled and then closed in narrow slits , a way they did when she was silently laughing . " Because we can no longer use buttons , trinkets and beads for trade and barter , and because writers are charged practically the same for food , clothing , tooth paste and gasoline that other people are charged ; you will figure out for yourself what was at least one motive for writing it . " Laura laughed , but Eloise looked a little pained , so that Miss Westcote said hastily : " But that 's too sordid a motive for you to tell your club , is n't it ? And now I 'll give you a more literary sounding reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little black book . And then , " Who are your primary characters ? " That was easy , and Miss Westcote named them . " Your secondary characters ? " Scratc  --  cratch in the little black book. 1itA White Bird Flying " Your tertiary characters ? " Miss Westcote 's eyes narrowed again into quiver ? ing slits . " My dear Mrs. Deal , you 're getting me worried . Is there such a word as quartuary ' for the fourth in importance ? " Eloise said she thought there was one with that meaning , although she had her doubts about it being that particular word . " And I rather think the three . . . the three . . . what shall I call them . . . ? " " Layers , " Miss Westcote suggested , her eyes crinkling . " Sets , " Eloise corrected . " I rather think the three sets of characters are enough to report . " " So do I , " agreed the creator of those characters . " Now for the questions . " Eloise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you consider your chapter of climax ? " " What are the main crises before the climax ? " " What were your controlling factors in plot formation ? " Miss Westcote later related the incident to the friend sharing the cottage : " She had me completely floored . I could scarcely remember the names of the characters . If there was a climax I had mislaid the thing . I could n't have sworn absolutely that I wrote it . In a maze of academic questions , she had destroyed my poor little story . It was dead , ? killed on the dissecting table under an anesthetic . If a story , Blanche , is worth mulling over in a meetingat all , it 's worth reviewing as a thing of flesh90A White Bird Flyingand blood and spirit rather than of bones and dead tissue and numerical dimensions . The girl was darling , sweet and understanding , ? but the mother , ? one of those highly efficient women who would have arranged the stars in symmetrical rows and dis , pensed with the milky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the second week , Uncle Harry grew restless and irritable . Aunt Carolyn seemed striving to be carefully tactful . She began inquiring about a hotel in northern Wisconsin , casually speakingof the delights to be encountered there as related to her by some young woman who had been a guest the year before . Uncle Harry became interested , cheerful . With much commotion and questioning he collected data about it : distance , roads to take , prices , conveniences , kind of people there . He spent a long time sitting on the steps leading down to the dock with the young woman who had given Aunt Carolyn the information . The two weeks were over , the beautiful two weeks . Laura thought she could not stand it , never again to see the lovely birches and the winding roads , smell the pungent green pines and hear the lapping of the cool blue water . She felt sad and depressed with that emotional thrill which always accompanied the sensations . She went over to see Miss Westcote and to bid her good-by . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miss 911 White Bird FlyingWestcote . " Laura 's serious brown eyes met the kindly twinkling ones of the older woman . " And I 've loved knowing you , too , " Miss Westcotewas saying . She held Laura 's hand . " Keep up your writing . Write the things you know and understand . . . " She smiled down on her , " . . . your own prairies and your own people . Write it in your own way . . . the way you see it . Do n't imitate or copy . . . you would n't do that with words . . . but do n't even do so with the spirit of the thing . Do n't try to look at your own prairies and your own people as an outsider does . Interpret them as you feel about them . . . knowing that there will be others who see and feel as you do . " Laura wanted to talk more , to ask a dozen questions , to tell this wise woman many things that were close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her mind and take the thoughts out one by one and show them to Miss Westcote . She wanted to repeat to her the verses she had run across after her grandmother 's death , to tell her that no one had ever held her complete confidence since that time , to confide in her about the wonderfulmagic dreams and desires she and Grandmotherused to discuss , to make her understand that all there was to see now was a white bird flying . But she felt that old tight-throated sense of restraint , and only thanked her , told her she would do the best she could , and said good-by . When she turned away and walked down the little path where the 92A White Bird Flyingpine needles lay like a thick brown rug , she felt that nothing in the world could keep her from making another Miss Westcote of herself , that she would never let anything in life handicap her or swerve her from the goal . When they parte  --  he Deals were to go home by train at the Wentworths ' expens  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 're coming with me again . You 're coming East to stay with me awhile , " he said suddenly , as though he had just thought of it , " is n't she , Carolyn ? " Aunt Carolyn smiled and said yes , that would be lovely . Uncle Harry grew more enthusiastic . He went ' up and down , see-saw fashion , on his slim immacu- Ilate heels and toes . " I 'll send for you . Soon . She Il ! can come , ca n't she , Eloise ? " Eloise was pleased and made no effort to hide it . " It would be the making of her . " She was earnest and grateful . " I 'll drop you a line when the time comes . And send you a check . I would n't want my little girl to be at any expense when she 's visiting me . " He shook hands again . He sprang on to the running board and into the car , tilting his youthful hat jauntily , winking a bright brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger at her and saying : " You'llhear from me , you rascal . Probably next summer , you 'll hear from your Uncle Harry . It 'll be fun to have you ther  --  nd a lot of your friends around . " 93A White Bird FlyingAunt Carolyn settled herself heavily in the big car , with Annette fixing cushions and the footrest . She had on a loose shapeless dress for comfort in riding and wide flat oxfords . The big car drove off with Uncle Harry waving his jaunty , boyish hat . Laura felt depressed . There was something wron  --  something terribly . wrong ther  --  ut she did not know just what it was . Marriageought not to be like that . CHAPTER VIIIW HEN they were back in Cedartown , slipping comfortably into the old routine , Laura realized that she was being swept along in the stream of preparation that emptied as it were into the great gulf of the University . It seemed a terrible thing that she could not stop it . Why could n't people do what they wished ? Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had spent so many years , and looked longingly at the old building as one looks at the familiar face of a friend . She fancied it looked kind , motherly , almost compassionatethat she was to go away . Strangely enough she failed to remember that she once felt the same temerity upon entering its portals that she was now feeling . The clan all discussed her , long and openly , at Katherine 's on a Sunday afternoon in August . The lovely little English home was full of Deals : Aunt Margaret and Uncle " Doc " Baker and Grace Deal , who was teaching in the University now , were there from Lincoln . Aunt Isabelle and Uncle Harrison Rhodes were there on their annual trip out from Chicago . Uncle Mackenzie and Aunt Emma Deal , their son Stanley and his wife and two children wereH95A White Bird Flyingthere from Omaha . John , Eloise , Laura and Trib were all there , as well as Jimmie , Katherine and littlePatty , six months old now and the center of attraction . " Going into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Emma who inadvertently began it . Eloise immediately answered for her . " Oh , yes , Laura 's going into a sorority . " " Mother , " Laura was disturbed , embarrassed . " 1 do n't know that I would be taken . " Eloise 's mouth set in a firm line . " I think you 'll be taken all right . " Why did mother say that out before every one ? She might not be pledged . Others had something to say . Immediately it became the topic of conversation . The Deals were always like tha  --  oisy and argumentative , each one sharpening his wits against the other 's judgment . There was diversity of opinion here . Jimmie Buchanan , Uncle Doc Baker and John Deal were decidedly anti-fraternity . Eloise , Aunt Margaret , Aunt Emma , Katherine , Stanley Deal and his wife were all Greek letter advocates . Because it had no direct bearing on music , the Rhodeses were not especiallyactive in the discussion . Uncle Mack was neutral , ? dipping in here and there on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know , inasmuch as she taught there , declared they were necessary evils . " I do n't like everything about them . . . but just suggest something constructive to take their96A White Bird Flyingplace . You ca n't criticize without substituting some constructive idea . " " Dormitories . . . treat everybody alike . I 've been working for that move for a long time . " It was John Deal . " Of all utterly snobbish outfits the frats get the hand-crocheted waffle-iron , " was Jimmie Buchanan 's verdict . " Yes , they ought to be abolished entirely . Think of a democratic tax-supported institution . . . and a decent tax-payer 's son ca n't go up there without . . . " " But , John , " it was Margaret Baker , " it 's human nature to form in cliques . Seven thousand people ca n't all go together in one nice democratic crowd . " " That 's it . . . there you are . . . that 's the answer , " several said triumphantly . Katherine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunches . Say the charters were all taken away to-morrow , Uncle John , and the chapter houses turned over to the University . . . if that were possible . . . by next Sunday the crowds living in them would all have reorganized and have new names : " The Apache Indians , " or " The Ancient Arabs " and " The Dirty Devils . " Every one laughed at that , and it temporarily cleared the atmosphere which was becoming warmer with slight indications of a storm . " Kathie 's right , " Eloise put in , " I 'll say it 's better974 White Bird Flyingto be organized nationally with creeds and super-visors . " " Maybe it 's all right for the East with their older traditions , but here in this democratic Midwest . . . " " Where men are men and women are W.C.T.U. members , " Katherine inserted with her usual flippancy . " Look what the fraternity did for Allen Rinemillerin the time he was there , " some one said . Eloise snorted . " You ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jimmie Buchanan took it up . " That 's a frat for yo  --  ounced on a green country kid like Allen because of his fine athletic record . He makes a few important plays and the frat sits back on its haunches and takes all the glory . " " But , Jimmie , look what it did for him socially ? took the shine off his hair and put it on his shoes ? got his hair cut righ  --  ut him in a tuxedo . " " And the Pi Tau hous  --  ou ca n't put a fellow in a house furnished like that and not have his standardsof living raised . The Pi Tau house is a beauty ? it looks like a church , and ? " " Ha ! Ha ! That 's pretty good . " It was Jimmie Buchanan , again . " Looks like a church maybe ... " And he went off into a personal and private gale of laughter . " Allen 's going back again now , " Laura volunteered . " I met him yesterday on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FlyingThey discussed the subject long and noisil  --  he Deals . They were like that , full of interest toward all that was going on around them . In the midst of the brisk debate , there was a taptappingsound on the cement sidewalk . " Uncle Oscar , " Emma said with supreme resignation . " Now the shouting and the tumult will die , " Katherine predicted , " and we 'll hear a little about the original brotherhood of fraternities , . . . the Ancient Order of Ox Drivers . " ' The old man came in smiling , his black hat in his hand , in his shabby coat the G.A.R. button and " 68 . " He felt a great happiness to see so many of his old friends ' children and their children in one group , a deep gratification that he had taken the notion to walk down here just at this time . He had brought lettuce to Kathie in the pail with a rope for the handle . Although Jimmie held a chair ready for him , theold man stood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into all their faces . " There'sabout as many of you here as there was the timeyour father and my brother Henry and I fixed upa wagon to haul the whole neighborhood down toWeeping Water . I mind as how at the County fairthey was goin ' to give a prize to the precinct thatcould get up the largest representation . Well , sir , Will Deal and Henry and me put our heads togetherAnd said old Stove Creek precinct would just natu-99A White Bird Flyingrally come home with that money . Took boards and spliced out the longest wagon box you ever see . . . had four team of oxen on it . . . " Every one was avoiding Kathie 's laughing eyes . " Piled all the Deals and the Lutzes and the Reinmuellers and some others in ' n ' drove to the fair . You should o ' heard ' em shout when we come . Equipage was so long we could n't turn around . . . had to go on through the little street and turn around on the prairie beyond the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Abbie Deal was playin ' the accompaniment to Red , White and Blue ' and Columby the Gem of the Ocean . ' Wagon was so long they could n't keep together in their singin ' . Will Deal and I was drivin ' the ox teams . And Henry would run along side ' n ' yell : " Read  --  et -- -sing . ' Once Henry come up to the back end and says : Darn it . Quit singin ' that Who Will Lead Me Home To Heave  --  he front end 's singin ' Three Blind Mice . ' " And he slapped his knee and chuckled over the pleasant memories . If John Deal did not care about his daughter going Greek , Eloise had no greater desire than that she would . Laura knew which one would win , providingshe were invited . She added the last always , feeling very young and unsophisticated and not havingany too much confidence in her own appearance , By the next week party bids began arriving . Laura was surprised beyond measure . It seemed unbe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bird Flyingnothing unbelievable about the daughter of a Wentworthhaving plenty of invitations . She was planning to go to Lincoln with Laura to see that the affair was engineered correctly . " I could n't trust Laura to see the thing through herself , " she said to John . " She 's such a day dreamer , and she seems to care almost nothing about getting on socially . She 'd be apt to forget to keep her most important house bids . There are the Chi Taus now . . . wealthy girls . . . and the Alpha Betas . . . family counts the most there . . . the Gamma Zetas are a lively bunch , prominent socially . . the Rho Phis are awfully good nationally ? she has party bids from them all . . . and it 's of the utmost importance that she make one of these . " " Why is it ? " John wanted to know . " Laura 's a nice ki  --  he 'll make friends anywhere . " " Of course , you would say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  nd just stud  --  nd make a few frowsy friends . . . " " I had a faint notion we were sending her up there to study . When I was in the University ... " " Yes , we know . You curried Dr. Overman 's horses and stoked the Chancellor 's furnace ... " " And made plenty of good substantial friends : .. " he returned warmly . " Well , Laura ca n't stoke furnaces . . . " " Nobody wants her to work her way when she does n't have to ... but it seems to me you put a lot of stress on the social side . " IOIfl White Bird Flying " I do , and there 's plenty of reason for it . Listen to me , John Deal . You 're a man and could n't be expected to have the intuition a mother has . Prac. tically every girl who leaves school , leaves it en gaged . Now I 'm far-sighted enough to prepare for that . If she goes Alpha Beta or Gamma Zeta or one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hastened to answer her own question : " The brothers and the friends of Alpha Beta or Gamma Zetas . See ? It 's as simple as daylight . " " And where 's the assurance that the brothers and the friends are going to be so all-fired nice ? " But that was too much for Eloise . If one could not comprehend the superiority of the brothers and the friends of Alpha Beta or Gamma Zet  --  here was simply no use discussing it . So Eloise fitted Laura out in pretty new clothes , and armed with the party invitations and her own efficient management , accompanied her to school . John hated to see his little girl go . She was only seventeen . The school seemed so huge . Would she come back to him still sweet and unspoiled ? Or snobbish and sophisticated ? He wanted to tell her how much he loved her , how proud he was of hei little talent , how happy he wanted her always to be . But he could not bring himself to say any of those things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her cheerfully , when she left . The more deeply he felt anything , the less articulate he was . IO2A White Bird FlyingHe had always been that way , and Laura was like him . Eloise and her ewe lamb stayed at a leading hotel during the rush week . Aunt Margaret Baker had offered them the hospitality of her lovely home , but Eloise said no , they would be right down town ready for anything that came up . And plenty of things came up . Laura was herded to breakfasts and luncheons and dinners , to afternoon teas and evening parties . Some of the chapter houses were gorgeous in their furnishings . One or two were not quite finished so that they stepped over lath and plaster in part of the rooms . There seem always to be lath and plaster on the campuses of midwest colleges . Laura could not quite understand the queer quality of the atmosphere . There was something about it she had never experienced befor  --  something tense and important , as though every one 's welfare hung in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exterior of convention seemed to cover something primitive that might at any moment break its leash and bound out . Girls she had never seen before put their arms around her . Many told her she was a darling . Some confided that , honestly , she was the keenest girl that had been in the house . Laura said to herself : " That is n't so . I can see right through them . " But some of the girls had other qualities , ? graciousness that seemed a part of them and not103A White Bird Flyingassumed , sincerity that showed in their conversation . Some were jolly with infectious laughter . At first , Laura met them curiously with some attention to their various characteristics ; but after a time she grew tired , confused , unable to tell the ones she fancied from those she did not . And once in the mad rush , her mother happened to remember that Laura must go to the huge Coliseum to register for classes . It seemed a waste of time to Eloise , but after all , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought also . Registration was effected with no casualties , although it was well for Laura that her own chosen course carried no science of number and quantity and all their respective relations . It was very trying , and in the midst of the confusion , she sometimes longed for an hour in which she could go out in the grape arbor of their back yard , and sit and read and think . The rushing parties were all over at last , and , in the temporary shelter of the hotel room the potentialauthor shed nervous tears . She was so bewildered , she told her mother , she had n't the faintest . idea with which group she wanted to align herself . But Eloise chose for her . " Alpha Beta , " she said unhesitatingly , firmly . " That 's your first choice , Laura . I do hope they will take you . It seemed the last word to me in an aristocratic group . Gamma Zeta is your second choice , and Rho Phi third . When you turn in your list , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 104A White Bird Flying " And where 'll I live if not any of those three bid me ? " Eloise 's nostrils quivered , and her mouth became a firm straight line . One might have wondered if the whole system did not totter perilously in that moment . But the old order of things was happily preserved , for Laura went Alpha Beta . A little frightened and decidedly homesick , she was towed to the house at the specified time by Eloise , triumphantand self-complacent . The Alpha Beta house was old , and like WestminsterAbbey , fruit cake , and wine , all the better for that . In fact , its very antiquity gave it an air of superiority which is the ultima thule of attainmentat colleges west of the Missouri , in some of which Time has not played so long in the cast that he has called in his partner , Tradition . The house had an atmosphere of mellowed aristocracy which exactly suited Eloise 's aspirations for Laura . The white woodwork and mahogany doors , the delft blue hangings , soft-toned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quaint chintzes in the sunrooms , the rather old-fashioned furnishings of the bedrooms all seemed combining to make capital of the fact that they represented one of the first chapterson the campus . Eloise was satisfied . And as she did after most attainments of the John Deal family , cut another notch in the gun of her own efficient management ; although as a matter of fact , if the interior ofIOSA White Bird FlyingEloise 's mind had been disclosed to the chapter , nothing would so certainly have lost Laura her bid as the knowledge that her mother had definitely picked Alpha Beta for Laura , before Alpha Beta had done its own picking . When Eloise said good-by to her Alpha Beta pledge in the wide open spaces of the lower hall where the stairway with the dull mahogany handrailcurved up to the higher regions , Laura thought she could not stand it to see her mother go . Not especially companionable in the deeper sense , Eloise was a good mother , and Laura felt closer to her at the farewells than she had ever felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home a year before I came , " Laura was winking fast , now that the partingtime had come . Her mouth was trembling . But Eloise kept a stiff upper lip . " You will be very happy here . Just think what mother has accomplishedfor you " ? ( the Alpha Betas should have heard that ) ? " I 've got you in what has seemed to me the very best one of all . You 'll ' meet the best people . And maybe " . . . Eloise was archly playful : " maybe you 'll have a nice young man some day . . . the brother or cousin of one of these aristocraticgirls . " " Oh , no . " Eloise could not have said it at a more inopportune time . " Oh , no , I do n't care for men , Mothe  --  ot at all . I really do n't . You do n't understand .... " Seeing that Laura was genuinely distressed , Eloise Io6A White Bird Flyingchanged her tactics . " After all , I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She was the personification of tact . " So just keep your mind on your studies . Good-by now . . . keep your head up . . . do n't let any one run over you . The Deals are all good capable peopl  --  ou do n't need to be ashamed of the name Deal . Your father has been in legislature . Your Uncle Mack is a banker in Omaha , your Aunt Grace on the University faculty , your Aunt Margaret a leading physician 's wife here in Lincoln , your Aunt Isabelle a music teacher in Chicago . " Eloise tabulated them as though it were all news to Laura . " The Deals are all decent , capable peopl  --  nd above all that , remember your mother was a Wentworth . " With this parting dose of nerve stimulant , Eloise placed her small-town child in the lap of the gods . And University life had begun . " She probably would n't have made it , " Eloise said complacently to John on her return , " if I had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decision . " " And what if she had ? " " If she had . . . " Eloise lowered her voice in the hushed tones one associates with grief and bereavement , " If she had , she might never have been bid again . " Yes , Laura went Alpha Beta . But some did not . One girl was not taken on account of her freckles , one had been tabulated a crock the moment sheI07A White Bird Flyingstepped inside the door , and another had made the fatal error of eating a bite or two of the garnishing on her salad . In the four years of their schooling , Laura saw the tan spots miraculously fade into the background of a pink and white complexion , the crock become the May queen , and the lotus-eater ? no , lettuce-eate  --  arn the Phi Beta Kappa key . But it 's a wise sorority that knows its own child , and no fraternity can read all there is in the stars and the crystal ball in one mad week of rushing . CHAPTER IXI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freshmen are the pawn  --  aura was given intothe care of a sophomor  --  ne Bernice Fowle  --  brisk capable girl with so many of the characteristics of Laura 's own efficient mother that one might havewondered if the two girls had not been interchangedat birth . Laura had not lived with her a full dayuntil she had altered the position of all the furniture in the room , rearranged Laura 's hair , ripped a lacecollar off one of Laura 's dresses and instructed herto wear brown beads with it instead , discussed achange of music teachers for her , and run over a listof male acquaintances to pick out a boy friend forher . By evening Laura also had received her firstlesson in fraternal rivalry . Standing at the window of their room on third , she asked guilelessly : " Whyare there so many cars all around the Gamma Zetahouse ? " To which Bernice Fowler said signifi ? candy : " It 's probably because there 's a stop buttonthere . There are never more cars around theGamma house than around ours . Remember that . " At the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few French words , the factthat she did not stand correctly in Phys . Ed. , thatIo9A White Bird Flyingthere is much more to the science of botany than pressing flowers collected along old Stove Creek , that all men are not born free and equal , that all Alpha Betas are God 's own children , that Pi Tau men rate much higher than Tau Phis , that Omega Gammas are the lowest species in the genus Greek , and that a barb is a microscopic organism of the animal kingdom . To be sure , some of this instructiondid not assimilate easily . And when food or instruction do not digest readily , they cause distress if they can not be thrown off . Laura was sensitive , deeply responsive to the feelings of all humans with whom she came in contact ; and this being so , she could neither wholly believe nor totally disregard . So she suffered a little in characteristic silence . All the first semester she was quite depressed concerninglife . But gradually when it was borne in upon her that most barbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually without the pale by choice ; that the lowly Omega Gamma men , who did not rate well , laughed and sang and danced and slapped each other jovially on their respective lowly backs and gave every evidence of wholeheartedlyenjoying life ; that some of her own exclusive Alpha Beta sisters had periods of depression , homesickness , no dating , deflated pocketbooks , and disappointments ; the world began to swing back into its natural orbit . Life was queer . But it was somewhatgaining its equilibrium . Several times she- met Allen Rinemiller on the IIOA White Bird Flyingcampus . Allen looked very collegiate in his up-todateclothes . And evidently he was popular , for he was always with football boys whose names were familiar to every one , ? fellows who were known for their campus activities -- or prominent sorority girls . Always they spoke , and once or twice Allen dropped out of the group he was with and talked to her a minute . The first time he did so Laura experienced a queer sensation , for although she despised herself for the snobbish thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , ? that at home a Deal was a bigger person than a Rinemiller , but that here a Deal was quite grateful for a little attention from a Rinemiller . And when she attended the football games with a bunch of Alpha Betas and saw Allen , big and grimy and dependable , get through the solid phalanx of the enemies ' lines , with the entire stadium gone wild , she felt quite important to think he was from home . Some girls are apparently born with dates ; some through much personal activity , achieve them ; but others seem by necessity to have dates thrust upon them . By going home for week-ends all fall , Laura evaded the dating question for which she had no great hankering , but by the time their own formal party was to be staged , it became apparent that she must have a date thrust upon her . Bernice Fowler secured this necessary equipment . And Laura was not overwhelmed with the gratitudeBernice seemed to consider her due . She dreadedIIIA White Bird Flyingthe ordeal much more than she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small talk . More than ever she was realizing how much like her father she was . Eloise saw that Laura had a pretty new gown . It was soft ivory silk , simply made on graceful lines , but all the more fetching for its simplicity . The " date " was a mere freshman , but in the abstract and unknown he presented to Laura all the horrible prospect of a masculine Gorgon . But when he was announced and she went down to the lower hall to meet him , seeing him in the flesh , ? and more bone than flesh at tha  --  oyish and nervous in his tuxedo , in her characteristic way , she suddenly felt tactful and at ease with him . She wondered why she always felt that way toward boys , almost motherly . He seemed nothing to her so much as Trib grown tall and dressed up , painfully trying to please her . When he smoked pompously , and spoke darkly of wild partieshis frat had thrown , she sensed that he was not quite used to it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him not to take the trouble to impress her with his worldliness . The formal at a big hotel was an elaborate affair . Your Cornhuskers and Jayhawkers and Hawkeyes are not entirely what their names imply . Elaborate gowns and decorations and imported musicians made up the ensemble . Because they have been doing this kind of social thing a less number of years than theirI12A White Bird Flyingeastern prototypes , perhaps they stress the settings even more . Allen Rinerniller was there with one Delores Thaxter , a Gamma Zeta . It was the first time Laura had seen Allen in evening clothes , and Allen in eveflingclothes was Apollo in a tuxedo . His superb well-built physique , his jolly clean-cut countenance , his blonde hair with its three distinct waves , his flippantease with every one , ? Laura thought she had never seen a man look nicer . They made as ideal looking a couple as Jimmie and Katherine , Laura decided , ? Allen and that Delores Thaxter . The girl was in dark red velvet . She was a sophisticated looking young woman from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social affairs all her life . Her older sister had been a friend of Kathie 's , ? they had been duchesses or princesses or something important together at the same AkSar-Benball . While she was lovely to look upon , Laura decided she did not like her . She made her think of a cat rubbing her sleek head against Allen . " I can almost hear her purr , " Laura said to herself as she danced with her bony freshman . When they accidentally bumped into Allen and Delores on the crowded dance floor , Miss Thaxter threw out a little annoyed frown at them , but Allen laughed , " Hello there , Laura . . . traffic 's congested , " and went on his pleasant terpsichorean way . Laura could not help but think of Allen in a tux there on the dance floor with the haughty Omaha113/1 White Bird Flyinggirl , in comparison with what her grandmother had told her about old Gus and Christine Reinmueller coming into Nebraska in a wagon which had been constructed from a rowboat , the bow facing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canvas doorway . It made her smile to herself to think of the change in the three generations . Nebraska had certainly been a melting-pot . " What brings out the dimples , ducky ? " It was her worldly-wise escort . Oh , how silly ! " Pardon ! My mistake , " Laura said coolly , and began analyzing herself even as she danced . Why was she different ? Most girls would have liked that simple kid 's remark . Yes , she guessed people were right , ? she was odd . And then by some shifting which Allen seemed to manipulate , the freshman , who knew Delores Thaxterslightly , was to dance with her , and Allen with Laura . But dancing with Allen proved to be more painful than dancing with the freshman . She could talk generalities to the freshman , but coming from the same community as she and Allen did , there seemed nothing for her to say except things that pertainedto home . And she could scarcely talk about Christine Reinmueller or his old girl , Verna Conden . Allen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for that terrible restriction on conversation which took hold of her . Everything that came to her mind to say seemed uninteresting , and her tightly constricted throat seemed in league with her dullI14-A White Bird Flyingmind . So aside from a few brief answers to Allen 's pleasant remarks , she had nothing to offer and quite in relief saw him go back to the dashing Delores , who from her animated appearance was in no way at a loss for small talk . The freshman took her to supper in that nervous am-I-pleasing-you manner which he had shown from the first of their meeting . He did everything correctlywith the chairs , the silver , the tipping , the wraps , but in a sort of tense manner as one who is doing something he has learned by rote . " His fraternityis doing a good job , " Laura told Bernice Fowler . " But he made me think of some one driving a car who sits stiffly at the wheel and never takes his eyes from the road . " Bernice was impatient with Laura 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no small amount of diplomacy in arranging the affair , and she did not choose to have it looked upon lightly . In countries where matrimonial affairs are arranged by a third party , Bernice would have made an excellent go-between . " He 's a nice man , ? from one of the oldest pioneerNebraska City families , and if he pays you any further attention , you grab it , " was her sisterly advice . " Most of our pioneer families in Nebraska are all of three generations old , " Laura returned , " and if you call him a man , then Allen Rinemiller is ready for the old folks ' home . " It brought on a discussion about Allen . TwoI15rWhite Bird Flyingother girls , a Dresden-china blonde and a tall Carmen-lookingone , were curled up in the two biggest chairs in the room . They were agreed in saying that Allen was one of the keenest men on the campus . Laura swung an active leg from a daybed and informed them : " Allen 's grandfather and grandmother , old Mr. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the state the very same day about sixty years ago . A Mr. and Mrs. Henry Lutz , ? those were my Aunt Emma 's parent  --  nd a Mr. and Mrs. Oscar Lut  --  hey all me  --  n their covered wagons , you know , ? at Plattsmouthor Weeping Water or some place along there , and came on to their land together where they settled . " " And they all lived together in a little crooked house ? " chirped the blonde . " They did not , " said Laura . " They built two little frame houses and a soddie and a dugout in the side of a ravine , and Allen Rinemiller 's granddad was the one that lived in the dugout . " " Can you feature it ? Can you feature it ? Imagine , ? thatritzy looking Pi Tau mar ' ! Who could believe it , ? his grandfather living in a dugout ? I never heard anything so perfectly unbelievable , " said the Carmen girl , whose grandfather had hauled hogs dead from cholera to an oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load . CHAPTER XTAURA 'S first year at the University was ove  --  year of readjustments , perhaps , more than of accomplishments . She passed the minimum of requiredgrades by a good margin , but with no apparentprospects of a P.B.K. ever coming to rest on the lapel of her jacket . She had made some friends , assimilated a certain amount of fairly , important information , and learned to concentrate in the midst of buzzing , laughing , crying , whistling , singing , typingand arguing . She wore an Alpha Beta pearl ? encrusted insignia on her breast and carried home the pleasant memories of freshman friendships , and the unpleasant ones of freshman disillusions . She had teachers who were apparently as kind to her as though she were not one of dozens who felt that they could write . John Deal was pleased with his young daughter . He saw no apparent change in her , and felt a little conscious-smitten that he had predicted such a thing . This was not surprising , for the greatest change that had taken place in Laura was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls who had traveled more or less . For a year she had listened to instructors speak casually of the East and Europe. 117A White Bird FlyingThe greatest change then in Laura Deal was that no longer did Cedartown seem satisfying . No longer would a blue and white room and an old grape arbor constitute a world . The day after she returned , Laura went immediately to see every one , as though she had just come from far countries instead of the distance a car could drive in a single hour . She met old Christine Reinmueller on the street and stopped to talk to her . Old Christine with her flat braided hair and blue calico dress , seemed more gentle , she thought , ? mellowedthe last year , as though in preparing to part with life she had grown tender toward it . Once , as she was talking , she wiped her hard old hand across her eyes . She spoke deprecatingly of Allen , ? the big fau  --  azy , ? he was all for graduating from the University , such a fehle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the gleam in her watery blue eye , detected that she was as proud of him as a peacock . At Kathie 's , she found Patty , sixteen months old now , as sweet as babies of that age usually are . Kathie , herself , was leaving for a bridge afternoon . " Oh , Kathie , how can you leave her just when she 's so cunning ? " Laura wanted to know , as Patty toddled back and forth in the nursery and did funny slobbery things with her pink mouth . Katherine laughed shortly , " Old-fashioned as ever , Lolly . I thought the Alpha Betas would take some of that out of you . I suppose you 'd have me I18A White Bird Flyingstay at home and watch over her like a mother hen and her chicken . No , I have this new Verna trained like a seal . She 's awfully good with her . " " Who 's Verna ? " " The new gir  --  Verna Conden . " " Verna Conden ? She works for you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't kno  --  just was surprised . She used to be so pretty and popular in High School . " " Well , she 's pretty yet . But I do n't know anything about her popularity . If she gets her work done and takes good care of Patty , it 's all I want to know . And do n't you get it in your little brown head that I 'm neglecting my baby . I have Dr. Rayburnlook her over at stated periods . Dr. Moss is watching her teeth , ? and she 's on as regular diet as the champion heavy-weight . The modern . mother puts it all over the ante-bellum one , Lolly , and so kindly remove that critical beam I see in your eye . " It struck Laura that Katherine was really irritated , that she was genuinely offended at her innocentremark . When she was leaving , Verna Conden , in a cap and apron , came quietly around the side of the house and called to her softly , " Laura , may I speak to you a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " " I 'm all right . I wanted to ask you something . " She was embarrassed . Her hard brown eyes lookedat Laura with level familiarity a moment and thenI19A White Bird Flyingdropped . " Does Alle  --  o with any one at the University ? " " Why , Vernal " It was Laura 's turn for confusion . " It 's different at the Universit  --  ou know ? every one dates . No one thinks anything about it . I scarcely ever see Allen . " " That 's all I wanted . Thanks . I know now . " And she turned and slipped back to the kitchen door . Laura went home depressed . Verna still liked Allen . Poor Verna , in her cap and apron , working for Kathie . And Allen , who was so popular at school , ? a " ritzy Pi Tau man , " dating Delores Thaxter . It was too bad . Things were awfully turned around in life sometimes . At home she spoke to her mother about Kathie 's flare-up when leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm line . " You stepped on her toes , unintentionally , Laura . I 'm glad you said it though . She just gads , gads , gads . That Verna Conden ought not have so much charge of that child . Jimmie does n't like it . He takes more care of Patty right now than Kathie . " Eloise dilated at length on what seemed to her crass neglectof a child . Laura was sorry she had started her mother off , for she was genuinely fond of Kathie and hated to hear her criticized so forcibly . Over at old Oscar Lutz 's Laura found him on the side porch watching the Cedartown small stream of life go by . He was delighted to see her , and talked I20A White Bird Flyingsteadily in his high voice . It was about odds and ends of things , with no special correlation . " Had plenty of gum to chew and did n't have to buy it in no pink or silver paper neither . Take a can and go out on the prairies , find some rosin-weed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gum that oozed out on the stalks . She liked it . . . get it for her lots o ' times . . . " Laura lisrening , knew who " she " wa  --  wondered idly how it would seem to have thought so much of a person . Immediately he was off on another tangent , althoughwhatever reminded him of it Laura could not see : " I mind how the dust storm of ' 82 come up . She and I was on the way to old man Norton 's funeral . Dust so thick , could n't see ahead of us . She sat in the end of the wagon with Christine Reinmueller . . . Gus could n't go and so we took Christine . . . all at once a horse come up and put its head right between her and Christine . They squealed right proper . . . guess the horse was every bit as surprised as Marthy and Christine . " In whatever he related , interwoven through all his talk , like a little silver song of accompaniment went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she had said , and laughing that thin high laugh about them . Laura sometimes secretly wondered why it was that he was not sad . How could he laugh so heartily ? If you loved some one and that person died . . . how could you ever after-I2IA White Bird Flyingward be anything but grieving ? And now he was saying : " I was telling her just yesterday . . . " Suddenly Laura ventured it : " Who , Uncle Oscar ? Telling whom ? " He stopped in surprise , " Why , Marthy . " " But , Uncle Oscar , it could n't have been just yesterday . How can you say that when she is n't here ? " He looked startled for a moment . " That 's right , " he said , as one who has suddenly admitted it . " She ai n't here . " For a brief time he sat leaning forward on his cane , so that Laura was angry with herself that she had said so cruel a thing . " Well , now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave you entirely . Now take me . . . I set here on the porch . . . and she seems to be working inside . When I 'm inside , I just think of her as bein ' out in the yard for a minute . . . sometimes I can hear her shut the door and go about her work . ' Tai n't so , I know , ? do n't think I 'm off in my head . . . but it pleases an old man 's fancies . And when the lilacs come out . . . it always seems she 's around . Lilacs . . . always associate her with lilacs . " Laura left him sitting ' there saying : " Yes , it pleases an old man 's fancies . " CHAPTER XI'YOUTH sees life as a plot , a gay , romantic adventuresomeplot . But they who have lived past their youthfulness , know that life does not arrange itself forever in well-defined patterns , nor does it always arrive at solutions . Life is like a rive  --  groping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its way through mists and shadows to some far sea . Every human is a part of the interminable flow . Every human is a part of the story . One life touches another and is gone . There is contact for a brief time , ? an influence for good or ill . And the river goes on , endlessly rising and falling , finding its way to the sea . Laura 's sophomore and junior years carried her a little farther toward that unknown shore , other lives touching her own , leaving their imprint . Classes in Narration and English Composition turned to Poetics and Advanced Narration . Philosophy and Child Psychology were left behind . Psychology of the Emotions and Mental Hygiene entered . Laura moved down on second floor and back on third . She roomed during different semesters with the Carmenlookinggirl and the little Dresden-china blonde and a sloe-eyed freshman . She attended ball games and1234 White Bird Flying fl White Bird FlyingIjisang lustily with twenty-five thousand others : " There Is No Place Like Nebraska " and , carried away by mass emotion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sacrificial pound of flesh if Nebraska , in the guise of Shylock , had demandedit . She went in and out of the Alpha Beta house with all the intimacy of her own home , and when , between courses at the candle-lighted dinner table , the girls sang : " Alpha Beta , I Love You , " and she saw the familiar faces of her sisters all about her , she would have thrown herself loyally on a burning pyre for Alpha Beta . But luckily , Alpha Beta required no such offerings to the gods . She wanted merely that one keep up to standard the honor of the house , which translated , meant scholarship , campus activities , appearance , and a high rate of dating . The summer between Laura 's junior and senior years saw her leave for the East on the long-promisedbut **25;639;TOOLONG invitation of Uncle Harry . It saw Eloise in a state of excited interest in the coming close proximity of her daughterto the wealthy uncle and aunt . It saw John Deal plodding faithfully back and forth his office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It saw Kathie flitting about , coaxing a thrill from life ; and curly-headed Patty , three years old now , in a constant state of waving farewells to her mother . It saw Jimmie attending strictly to his business in the bank , - mothering Patty between times. 124It saw old Oscar Lutz tap-tapping on the sidewalks of Cedartown , carrying gifts of vegetables to those whom he bored , accompanying every cabbage and turnip and radish with a recollection of the old days . It saw old Christine Reinmueller trudging about the farmyard , picking up in her apron a few cobs that the men had dropped from the wagon , scolding at the wastefulness , or sitting in the shade counting over and over on her hard calloused fingers the eighties she had once owned , trying to remember where each had gone . The summer saw Allen farming his acres of rich black soil , directing his help , but with his own broad shoulder to the work , too . Allen was nearly through school now , ? only another semester in which to finish a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his life , was searching constantly for the answer to his unrest . July saw his wheat harvest under way , the high tide of the year for agriculturists . For those who love their Midwest it is a gladsome sight , ? when the fields are half harvested , when half of the gold of the fields has turned to the bronze of the stubble . The old glamorous days of the harvest are over . The romance of the harvest season is practically a thing of the past . The rhythm of the scythe which once stirred poets is heard no more . One-man combinesdo the work of six men without the spectacular aid of the brawny bodies of harvest hands . Time was when the harvesting was a struggle of manyI25fl White Bird Flyingdays , the workers , men , women , and horses , ? exhaustedwhen the grain was safely threshed and stored . Once a stream of harvest workmen migratedfrom the southern tip of the continent to the northern border , following the lead of the ripening grain , ? a subject matter for novelists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the continent with hands on their gear-shifts . The rustic daughter who once carried the jug to the field , whose favor was the prize for which the hero and the villain threshed the wheat or husked the corn , is now usually home from college for the summer , doing anything but picking her dainty way through stubble to the men who run the combine . When half of Allen 's wheat was in the shock , the rains descended for a day and a night . But Allen was also a corn and alfalfa farmer , and , as he said , what was " sauce for the goose was applesauce for the gander . " It is this diversified farming as it is practiced to-day that has steadied weather conditionsin the Midwest . In the days when the hot winds blew from an unbroken expanse of stubble fields and barren lands , serious damage was done . But under modern conditions the landscape is broken with such regularity by crops still unmatured , that serious damage from the winds is no longer likely . When the wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the corn tall and maturing in the fields , Allen went back to school for his last semester. 126A White lira , FlyingLaura , returned from the East , was plunging into her senior year . Sociology , Browning , Magazine Article , Novel Study , ? she looked over her schedule with happy anticipation for the amount of constructivework for which it called . Apparently , Allen was to date Delores Thaxter again this year . Laura saw them sometimes on the campus , standing and talking by Science Hall . Often Allen 's long green roadster stood in front of the Gamma house where traffic continued to be thick , although Laura , herself , would not have admitted now that it was from causes of popularity . Whenever Allen saw Laura he was always cordial . At sight of her he would break into his cheerfulgrin and give her some kind of a high sign . Sometimes they stopped a few minutes by the Ad. ministration building to talk or ran into each other at the college book store . " What 's new back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How 's every one in the sticks ? " He seemed to gloat over the fact that he came from the country . " Now us farmers , . . " how serious was Allen 's affair with Delores Thaxter Laura did not know . All University affairsappeared serious to an onlooker . Laura , herself , even now at the beginning of her senior year had no deep and desperate love affair as had the127A White Bird Flyingmajority of her sorority sisters . She accepted dates to keep away from the opprobrium of being a crock , and thereby bringing utter disgrace upon a group which prided itself upon a one hundred per cent dating . But the dates were looked forward to with no passionate longing nor back upon with any degree of heartstab . Part of the time she was frankly relievedwhen they were over and she could slip into her own room and read or dream and scribble . That trip east to Uncle Harry 's and Aunt Carolyn 's had added further zest to her dreams of a future of accomplishment , had set her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She felt aloof , a little like a candidate for a sisterhood , a novice who would some day take the veil . She lived and moved and had her being with her family and friends , laughed , joked , conversed with them , but was not one of them . A story accepted by The Prairie Schooner , Nebraska 's own literary magazine of highest type , was a thrilling reality . A poem in the same periodical , following later , added fuel to the little flame that burned so steadily within her very being . It seemed strange that one could so thoroughly play two parts , she told herself , ? that a girl could take her place in the activities of college and sorority life , genuinely enjoying most of them , and remain the cloistered nun looking out through windows upon the panorama of the world . But it was true . That was her own dual personality . And the clois-128A White Bird Flyingtered person was the real one , ? the real Laura Deal , who , looking through the windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She could now scarcely realize that this was the beginning of her senior year . Where had the time gone ? It seemed such a little while ago that she had parted tearfully with her mother in the lower hall of The House . She said something of that now to Bernice Fowler . Bernice had dropped out after her sophomore year to teach , and as a consequence was to finish with Laura . She was in all campus activities , wasa Mortar Board , Big Sister , Y.W. , ? everything was grist for her busy mill . The little blonde and the Carmen-looking girl , and a red-haired young person whose talk was usually as crisp and vivid as her flaming hair , were all in Laura 's and Bernice 's room lounging about in the various attitudes which one finds in the illustrations of " Daily Exercises . " They formed a little inner circle in the sorority , a sort of unacknowledged and unnamed sorority within the sorority . They were all seniors , and four years of habitation under the same roof had rendered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insults . The talk now was desultory . By no manner of excuse could one term it conversation . It fluttered about over a dozen scattering topics as a swallow dips from one place to another . Quite suddenly it lighted , with no apparent reason , on the odd ideas which people who do not live there have129A White Bird Flyingof the Midwest . Every one knew an anecdote which she brought out in turn and deposited with scorn on the scrap heap . " The Midwest , ? what does it mean to people who 've never been here ? They 've the craziest notions . My cousin . . . a kid in his teens . . . was visiting in one of the New England states , and something was said about a story he 'd read in the SaturdayEvening Post . The dumb-bell he was visiting said , Oh , do they have Saturday Evening Posts in Nebraska ? ' Can you beat it ? " " Prof. Newton told me , himself , he knew just two things about Nebraska when he came out to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Laura said . " A woman in Omaha , a musical critic and smarter than smart , told my mother she was in England and met an Englishman , ? you know , girls , Englishmen inhabit England , ? and when the introduction took place , the one who did the deed said , I want you to meet Miss So-and-So of Omaha , Nebraska . ' Whereuponthe Englishman toddles around and hunts up his wife and says , I want you to meet Miss So-andSoof Omaha , fllaska . ' " They all laughed , and Bernice Fowler said , " Anybodycan forgive an Englishman . . . I 'll bet you think that Manchester is on the Isle of Man , ? but what burns me up is Americans , themselves . A neighbor of ours in Nebraska City was some place East . . .

" " I 've an aunt who has never come out here visitingbecause she thinks she 'd have to lug along a tin bathtub . " " How do they get that way ? " some one asked . " It 's the writers , " the Red-Head said . " They 're to blame . Nobody writes anything about Nebraska as it is now . And of course , everybody thinks it 's just like it used to be when the Indians jazzed around and played You 're it ' with arrows .

' She told afterward she had been ready to see everything there was and take solid pleasure in it , but it was their manner that got her , and she vowed to herself she would n't have a thrill to please them . I wish I could remember everything she told , but part runs like this : " There was something head-lining the papers about General Pershing and she grew chesty about him being a Nebraskan .

As there was nothing more pressing than the term paper on " American Criticism , " the outline of Englishidioms , and the unfinished but scarcely important parody , Laura said she was not busy , ? not at all .

" " They took Grandma over to the State Hospital yesterday . " " Oh , Allen ! The State Hospital . She 's not " Yes . . . gone nuts . " " Oh , I 'm sorry ! " " She 's not very bad .

I 'll be awfully glad to go with you if you want me . " And she was up the stairs again on third to get a chic little brown hat and a fur . Red-Head , Dresden-China and Carmen all met her in the upper hall . " Lolly Deal , however did you work it ?

" " What big teeth you have , Grandmother 1 " " The better to eat you , my dear ! " Laura turned at the top of the stairs , said succinctly , " Go sit on three tacks , " and went down to Allen. 137CHAPTER XIIFROM the sorority house they drove in Allen 's long green roadster through the shaded streets of Lincoln , where elms and poplars bordered the close-cropped lawns , past lovely homes set in emerald frames of shrubbery untouched yet by frost , until they came to the group of buildings which make up the little city of unfortunates . Up the long curving drive they swung and parked the roadster near a graveled path . They went first into the office , but were there directed back to the yard . They found her under the trees with one of the nurses in uniform . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peasant woman of the old school , with her shapeless body , her seamed red face , and her faded hair braided in its thin flat braids like a colorless little rug pinned to the back of her head . Idly under the trees sat old Christine Reinmueller , her gnarled red hands with their broken and blackened nails , lying in her lap . " Do you know me , Grandma ? " Allen bent low over the shrunken little figure . She looked up at him with dim blue eyes , blurred and watering . " You 're . . . one of ' em , " she said. 138A White Bird Flying " Yes .. . . I 'm Allen . . . your grandson . . . Herman ' ; ' s and Lucy 's son . " " Ya . . . I know . " She was listless , inattentive . " And ( this is Laura , Grandma . " Allen drew the girl forward . " Do you know her . . . Laura Deal ? " The olld eyes turned to Laura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deal . . . Deal . " She brightened . " Ya . . . you I kncow , too . " She put up her hard old hands and drew Laura 's soft white one into them . " So ? For so long . . . I not see you . . . huh ? For so long a time , you not come by me . And so many tings togedder ve do . Ya . . . I know . . . " She nodded wisely . " Of me you take care ven my babies are born .. Of you I take care ven your babies are born . . . " " Oh , I say , Grandma . . . " Allen reddened a little . Suddemly , Laura knew . " Never mind , Allen . She thinks I 'm my grandmother . She thinks I 'm Abbie Deal . " " Ya . . . dats it . . . Abbie . . . I remember hard now . Abbie ! My frien ' . . . my frien ' for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink palm with her own calloused ones , and uttered little soft purring sounds .

De long grass wave . . . de sunshine . . . all vas f reundscha f t . . . friendship . Togedder all vas freunde . . . frien 's . How you not come see me . . . my Abbie frien ' ? " Laura 's ready emotions were stirred unaccountably . She was winking back the tears . How dramatic ! How story-like ! " I 'll come now . . . often . I 'll drive out again . " " I 'll bring her , Grandma . " Allen promised solemnly . He was a little embarrassed , anxious to get away . " Ya ! Bring her . . . you ! " She was evidently not fully conscious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ve talk . . . togedder ve remember . . . " " Yes , Grandma . " Allen 's fine blond head bent low , " we 've heard you tell all about those old times . You had a pretty tough time , did n't you . . . gettingall your land in shape . . . ? " A change came over Christine . An evil expression slipped over her leathery , wrinkled face . It grew malicious , cunning . " De land . . . " she said , " So ? It 's you knows about my land . . . all my eighties . . . eleven eighties I have . . . So ? My land you take . . . ? " She was rising , menacingly , stepping toward them with threatening gestures . Involuntarily , Laura slipped back against Allen and his arms went tightly around her . Together they stood for a few moments , uncertain what to do . Then the nurse shook her head at them and nodded toward the140A White Bird Flyingparked car . Allen 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they walked over to the car . They drove away silently , the shadow of the interviewover them . Laura was distinctly disturbed . Part of that emotional disturbance seemed to come from the things the old German lady had said , but a little of it was from that queer moment when she had involuntarily slipped into Allen 's arms . She did not go in for that sort of thin  --  ad no taste for it ? the girls at The House laughed at her for being old-fashioned , but she quite distinctly knew her own mind . She wished now that she had kept her head a little better . There had been no real danger from old Christine . It looked a little as though she had chosen to make the most of a simple situation . In reality , it had been done almost without her volition . And with Allen Rinemiller , of all people ! It was foolish , of course , to exaggerate the small incident , so she ignored the memory of it and opened the conversation with : " Poor old lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of get you . . . to think about their coming here over sixty years ago ? My grandmother used to tell me about it . Your grandparents and mine and old Oscar Lutz and his wife , and my cousin Katherine 's grandparents , Henry and Sarah Lutz , all met at the Weeping Water and came on into our community the same day . Grandma used to say there was n't a thing to be seen but the blue sky , the prairie grass141A White Bird Flyingin every direction on the low rolling hills , and a few trees along the creek bed . The sun was going down , the four wagons made a circle and they built a campfirein the center . The Indians camped near them , and frightened them silly . Can you feature it ? " " Lor  --  magine i  --  he very same spot where our farm lies , and the graveled roads and Cedartown . I never thought much about it , but hearing you tell about it , makes it pretty clear . Feature the compariso  --  ith cars going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailing over the farm ? . " And voices from both coasts coming into the homes , and being able to talk to any one by long distance . . . " " And a combine doing a hundred acres a day ... " They were approaching the turn now which would take them back to the University . " How about driving out farther ? Too busy ? " American Criticism and English idioms seemed suddenly very unimportant phases of life . " Oh , no , " said Laura , " I 'd love it . " They drove until there was just time to get back to the Pi Tau and Alpha Beta houses for dinner . In the meantime , they had discussed fraternities , sororities , friendships , athletics , professors , sunsets , careers , columnists , plays , moving pictures , life , love , and the best way to get rid of sparrows . When they had driven up in front of the Alpha Beta house , and Allen had gone with Laura to the142A White Bird Flyingdoor , he said rather seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if I may . " They could see the girls passing into the dining room . There would be no time to change . " Why , yes , Allen , " Laura laughed up at him , " we 'll have to have another talkfest and settle all the questions Congress ca n't . " At the table , she came in for a sly bombardment . " How did you find Grandmother , Lolly ? " They called it softly across the candles and low bowls of flowers , in the gentle well-bred tones requiredof Alpha Beta ladies at dinner . " Did you lift up the latch and walk in ? " " Any nice young woodsman rescue you , Lolly ? " Laura laughed at their nonsense . She felt gay , light-hearted , buoyant . A very nice thing had happened , ? shehad made a new friend . In one hundred and twenty minutes ticked off by her jeweled watch , a strange thing had happened . There flashed through her mind all those past years of inhibitions , ? that period in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could talk intimately . There had never been any one but Grandmother Deal to whom she could turn her mind inside out . Even as the girls thrust verbal pins into her with smooth suave voices , she was thinking of her father 's taciturnity , ? hermother 's lack of understanding , ? of cousin Katherine , ? of Aunt Grace , ? of her teachers , ? the girls here and those at home , ? there had never been any one of them to whom she could tell her in-143A White Bird Flyingnermost thoughts without confusion . Not until now . And just to-day something had happened . This afternoon a very lovely thing had taken place . She had found she could talk about anything toAllen Rinemiller . CHAPTER XIIII AURA went home over the week-end . But this s time she rode in Allen Rinemiller 's long green roadster . Allen was trying , as he said , " to keep one eye on the farm , one on the football field and one on the last of his studies . " The ride over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Midwest presents some days that are flawless . Blue skies , splashes of gold and scarlet along the river 's banks , fields of winter wheat as faintly green as fairy carpets , huge oblong patches of newly plowed earth , and whispering cornfields ripe for the husking . To top one of eastern Nebraska 's low rolling hills in October and see the entire hollow bowl of the world fitting the entire hollow bowl of the skies is to glimpse a bit of Infinity . Often there is a haze in the atmosphere , faint , ethereal , clinging in the hollowsof the far hills as though smoke from Indian campfires of long-gone Octobers lingered in the valleys . Allen and Laura , riding home in the green roadsterspoke of it ofte  --  he beauty of the day . They were both quite touched with gratitude at the generositywhich Nature was displaying for their benefit . Si145A White Bird FlyingHome seemed restful and quiet to Laura after the noise and confusion at The House , which usually resembled a martin-house with girls ' heads protrudingfrom all the doors in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give her Saturday afternoon over to attending a funeral service , Kathie 's Grandmother Lutz was brought from Kane sas City to be buried in the old home cemetery . She had been a dressy old lady , smart and bright-eyed up to her last illness . Looking at her in death , Laura could think of nothing so much as a little waxen doll with curly snow-white hair , pink cheeks , and dainty waxen hands across a satin dress , sunk down in the elegance of a white satin box . " My , my , how my brother Henry loved that girl , with her snappy black eyes and her pink cheeks and her merry ways , " Old Oscar was saying . It gave Laura a moment of shocked surprise , to think that the eighty-six-year-old waxen doll had once been a young girl . And evidently Oscar Lutz still thought of her as youthful . In the early evening Laura had strolled over to his yard when she saw him covering his roses with leaves and tying gunny-sacks about them . Old Oscar was getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much getting himself ready as his house and garden . He had sat down on the edge of the porch when he saw her coming . " And now Sarah 's gone . . . " be was saying , " and Old Christinebabbles about her land and I guess folks think146it White Bird FlyingI 'm not much better . My , we was a lively , husky crowd , ? Marthy and me , Henry and Sarah , Will and Abbie Deal , Gus and Christine Reinmueller . . . Well , I 'll go soon , too . " How could he , thought Laura , how could he speak so cheerfully of it , as though it were a casual trip into the next county . " One of these days I 'll catch up with ' em all . . . my old crowd . . . I 've lived way beyond my allotted time now . Do n't fear it a mite , not a mite . Only fear I have is that it 'll be a long-drawn-out sickness , slow like a tree rottin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches . . . sufferin ' all the time and puttin ' somebody to a lot of trouble . No , I want to go quick like a sturdy tree crashin ' in the wind . " " Do n't think about it , Uncle Oscar . Everybody would see that you had a good nurse . " " Would n't want a nurse , " he snapped . " Could n't afford one . " Laura wished that he did not have that trait of stinginess . Every one knew he had money , plenty of it . Every week or so he went into the bank and took his tin box back into her father 's office and looked over his bonds and mortgages . Laura liked the old man , but she wished he did not have that unlikable characteristic . " Quee  --  i n't afraid to die . But hate to leave , too . Hate to hand over the community to the new generation for ' em to run it . Always seems as though the country around here just belonged to us147IIA White Bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Balboa and the rest of ' em had that same feeling of ownership . " He laughed at himself deprecatingly . She had never heard him put it in so many words before , but she had always sensed it in him , ? a sort of brooding over the community as though he were personally responsible for its sins and virtues , its shortcomings and its good points . It was his state , his land , his people . Laura , listening , and only half attention , thinking that it was almost time for Allen Rinemiller to drive up , wondered idly if people understood the old man , ? realized that what they chose to look upon as meddling was in reality not that at all . Thumping along the graveled highways , tap-tapping on the cement sidewalks he went his way , advising , discussing , recalling , watching , planning . " Old Mind-As-How " they called him . She decided people did n't understand him . It was not that he wanted to meddle . He had merely never lost his sense of ownership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had merely wanted them not to forget . His state , his land , his people ! His cracked old voice went on its musing way : " Sarah was buried there to-day in the very land Henry gave for the cemetery . Sarah 's little orphanednephew died . . . she 'd brought him out on the long journey from Michigan . He was down by the creek bed one day and got snake bit . Doctor worked with him all night , but it killed him . He was the first one to be buried there . I made him a 148A White Bird Flyingpine coffin and Abbie Deal and Christine Reinmuellerlined it with one of Sarah 's quilts . Marthy helped Sarah wash and dress him . Henry picked out a knoll on his land , and him and I dug a little grave up there . . . the sun was hot and the wind was blowing the dry grass . . . and there was n't a sign of shade tree nearer than Stove Creek . That was the beginning of the cemetery . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your Grandmother Deal 's . We put a little wooden fence around them three graves so the cattle would n't step on ' em nor the coyotes bother ' em . The tumbleweedswould come rollin ' across the prairie and bunch up like dried brown snowdrifts . " Laura thought of " Hillside " as she had seen it that day , ? the lovely well-kept city of the dead with its hundreds of markers , its graveled paths and its huge shade trees , and could scarcely believe that old Oscar had seen the beginning . " Do n't know what 'll come of us , ? whether we'lljust lay there a long time . . . " Laura heard himgoing on as one hears the wind in the trees , ? an oldman talking only of death to a young girl who wasthinking only of life . " . . . Do n't see much difference , however it is . The bodies anyway go back tothe good old soil . Leaves and flowers , animals andpeople . . . under my eyes I 've seen ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time theelements run up through the trees and grasses andcome to life again . If I thought I 'd just help along149A White Bird Flyingthat way , it do n't seem so bad . I like to think that I 'll always be a part of the prairie round about here somewhere . " " Do you know , Uncle Oscar , ? you 're full of poetry ? " " Me ? S.iappin ' crocodiles ! Ai n't never read any poetry in my life but One Hoss Shay ' and Barefoot Boy ' and a few like that . " " Well , let me say one to you then and see if it is n't just about what you 've been saying . " And Laura , who always had poetry at her tongue 's end , told him the verses about : " Never gravedigger shall shovel me under , I shall arise with the loam 's mellow thunder To drift in the gray of the moor-mist yonder . " Never in grave 's maw I 'll be lying , With the wild geese in heaven flyingAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pretty . . . awful pretty . . . " He mumbled it over several times , as though he were alone . Allen drove up to the curb at her home and Laura slipped away . For a long time the old man sat there on the porch , through his mind running the pleasant thought of the mist on the prairies and the soun.1 of the wild geese honking . CHAPTER XIVOLD Oscar was distinctly interested in the fact that he had seen young Rinemiller drive up for Laura . On Sunday morning he tap-tapped over to the Deals ' and took walnuts in the old pail with a rope for a handle . When Laura emptied them , he said slyly : " You would n't want never to marry Allen Rinemiller , Laura . " Laura was amused at the old man 's meddling . " No , I know I would n't , " she agreed amiably , and added : " But why would n't I ? " so that old Oscar smiled behind the wind-break of his beard . " Nice boy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gus . . . his grandfather . Tightest-fisted Dutchman you ever see . Was so tight , that when he built their new house back in the old days , he picked up all the little pieces of stone no bigger than these walnuts and saved ' em for another foundation . . . so tight , he us. , d to pick the seeds out of the ground when they did n't sprout . . . tighter than the bark on a tree . . . and Christine worse than him . . . used to put her flatiron down in the coals so she would n't have to use much fire for ironing . . . used to sit up close to the stove so she would n't have to light lamps . . . not just savin ' . . . plain skinflints for stinginess . " I5 ' /I White Bird Flying " But those were his grandparents , " Laura said , " and Allen 's no more like that than anything . He 's the third generation , Uncle Oscar . " " You would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said confidentially that afternoon , when he cornered Allen at the curb in front of the Deal home . " Who said I would n't ? " Allen asked , so that the old man smiled behind the duck-blind of his beard . " Nice girl . . . " he mused , " but sort of thin and slimsy and delicate , not robust and hearty like the kind of girl you ought to have on a farm . Pick out a good stout one when the time come  --  ne with big bone and muscle , and you 'll have a partner instead of a plaything . " Allen laughed good-naturedly at the old man 's meddling . " When the time comes , it 'll be a wife I 'll want , not a hired man . " Old man Lutz tap-tapped back home . " Well , " he said cheerfully to himself as he packed his battered old bag for the California trip , " I do n't know much poetry , but I mind as how there 's a verse that says : " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agin ' the man ; And if that wo n't make a weddin ' Why , there 's nothin ' else that can . " Laura thought it was very kind of Allen to take her back to school Monday morning in the green roadster , ? neighborly and friendly . Allen thought 152if White Bird Flyingit very kind of Laura to go back with him , ? neighborlyand friendly . Late that night , with the sorority house locked and barred , and lights in the big brick structure snapping out one by one , Laura , in yellow pajamas , brushing her soft brown hair , heard the Carmen girl across the hall say : " Hot news , girls , ? they say over at the Gamma House that Allen Rinemiller is about to hang his frat pin on the dashing dapper devoted Delores . " Laura paused with the brush in her hand and frankly listened . It was not so surprising , but even so , it startled her a bit . She could see the three girls through the open door lounging about on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was Dresden-china . " She 'll be the next to pass the candy over there . And if you ask me , they 're beating us with announcements . We 'll have to pep up a bit . Carmen , ca n't you do something for God , home and country ? " Brush in hand , Laura walked into the room with : " All I can say is that Thaxter person will make a hot farmer 's wife . I 'll bet she does n't know any more about farm life than a kid from the sidewalks of New York . She probably thinks you plant winter wheat in winter and that a silo is a new kind of vege-table . " " Well , what do you care , Lolly ? " " I do n't care . But I hate to see Allen taken in . Do n't forget he comes from my home town . " 153fl White Bird Flying " That 's right , we forgot , Lolly . Our families are friends . His grandmother knew my grandmother . His grandfather knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt knew my ? ' " " Oh , choke her with the curtain tie-backs . " Laura would not laugh . " The Rinemillers have lots of land and Allen has big things ahead of him . He 's up on the very latest things in scientific farming .. . he gave a talk on some of the new methods to our Commercial Club at home . . . " " Listen to the little press agent . " " Not sour grapes about Delores ? " " Acid raisins , Lolly ? " The Red-Head chanted : " Lolly 's mad and I 'm glad , and I know what 'll vex her , When the big green car has gone afar And Allen no longer necks her . " They all howled . Laura said in her most courteoustones , " I hope your children all have hangnails . " Then she went into her own room and shut the door . Allen took Delores Thaxter to the Military ball for which he had already dated her . But to the amazement of Alpha Betas and Pi Taus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal . " How about it , Lolly ? " The girls teased her . " Off again , on again , gone again . . . " " Who gets the nice big football man for a prize ? Gamma Zeta or Alpha Beta ? " 154A White Bird FlyingAnd the Red-Head stood on one foot , bent her body forward and shading her eyes with her hand , recited dramatically : " The girls came around the bend with chariot wheels almost touching . Black horses and white were neck and neck . Eyes glued to the front , they urged on their sweating steeds . Laura Ben Hur was a little in the lead of Delores Messala . . . " Laura , herself , had to laugh at that bit of foolishness , but she retorted : " You girls give me a pain in the neck . " To which they returned an immediate musical answerin soprano , contralto and tenor form : " We give her a pain in the neck We give her a pain in the neck We 're awful sad to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck . " " And what 's more , " Laura spoke after the last musical chord had died away : " Delores can have him when it comes to marrying . I would n't marry him if he were the last man in the world . " " You would n't have to marry him , then , Lolly , " the ' Carmen-girl drawled languidly . After the Pi Tau formal , Allen very frankly went only with Laura . No Alpha Beta knew just what happened , but quite suddenly , Delores Thaxter was importing a medic from Creighton University , and Allen Rinemiller was ringing the Alpha Beta door bell one hundred per cent of the evenings in a week. 155A White Bird FlyingEloise was upset beyond measure . She talked about it most of her waking hours : " Imagine sendingher up there with several thousand young men running around loose on the campus , ? some of them from Lincoln 's and Omaha 's best families . She does n't pay much attention to those , of course , ? and then , out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In Eloise 's cold nasal tones it sounded as though it were " Rhinoceros . " " I ca n't think of a nicer chap , " John retorted . " Clean , decent , smart , good mixer , well-fixed . What more do you want ? " Eloise snorted . " Every time I look at him I see old Gus driving to town on a load of hogs and Christine in her blue calico dress . " " Every time I look at him I see a good old product of the Midwest 's melting-po  --  erman and American . He has the thrifty ambitious traits of the grandparent  --  is father 's honesty and decency , his nice mother 's refinement . Good kid , I say . " But Eloise 's mouth was straight and fixed in grim determination . All her life she had managed the family and not yet was she ready to yield the scepter . That night she wrote a long explanatory letter to Uncle Harry Wentworth . And she mailed it herself . CHAPTER XVALEN finished in the mid-year and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had a dozen changes he wanted to make , plans which would increase his business materially , he believed . And business it was to Allen . He turned the southeastroom into an office , installed a desk , two filing . cases and a typewriter . He was keeping a full tabulation of figures on production and cost and profits . If the wraith of old Gus could have hoveredover the scene , it would have been heard to say : " For what you expect to use them furnitures and books . . . to plow mit and harrow ? Mein Gott ! " But though Allen had many plans , the one Plan which preceded all others was now definitely formed . It was spring and Allen was young , and Springtime and Youth are a call to the rainbow 's end . Laura was home in April , ? home to discuss with her father and mother which of two positions she would take . Pretty lucky , she told herself , to have two from which to choose . Some of the girls had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a moody creature , soft and hard , gentle and ferocious , as capricious as a girl. 1574 White Bird FlyingSaturday was cloudy , with warm languorous sprinkles of rain smelling of moist loam and plum blossoms . There was an odor , too , of bonfires smoldering on through sudden gentle showers . Laura , in a snugfittingraincoat , full of the joy of living , did errands for her mother in the morning . When she came out of Kathie 's on the way home , Verna Conden stopped the sweeping of the front walk , and with that same air of embarrassment Laura had noted before , said : " I guess you must have been laughing in your sleeve at me . . . that day I asked you about . . . Allen . " Her voice was tense , a little bitter . " Why , no , I did n't , Verna . " Laura 's brown eyes looked frankly into the girl 's . Verna laughed shortly : " Well , it does n't matter , now , " and turned away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spring morning a little spoiled . Verna had referred to Allen 's and her friendship , of course . It bothered her all the way home , like a gnat that sung about her head and irritated her . At home again , she found two things had happened in the short space of time she had been gone . Old Oscar Lutz had arrived from California . And her mother had received a letter from Uncle Harry Wentworth . Eloise seemed nervously elated . She wanted Laura to get out of her things at once and find an easy-chair in which to sit while she read . The letter was important , so important that Laura 's 1584 White Bird Flyingwhole life would be changed by it , her mother told her . Laura slipped out of her wet coat , took the letter over by the east windows , and read it . Eloise was right . Eloise would have said she was always right . Laura 's whole life was to be changed by the letter . So different was it to be after the arrival of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What about the decision between the two positions ? " Laura was ready to say : " I 'm not taking either , Allen . I 'm going to my Uncle Harry Wentworth 's in New York and stay , well , until Christmas , anyway . " He was taking Laura back to the University , driving on a side dirt road rather than the graveled highway . The road dipped down little hills , trudged up steeper ones , turned a bit across small bridges set cornerwise to cut across a vagrant brook . There were wild plum blossoms along the right of way . The box-elders were pale April green , the maples dark April green , the winter wheat vivid April green . Fields were mellow for the planting ; pastures lush for the feeding . Pert robins darted across the highway , flying low and saucily in front of the car . At farmhouses , purple martins were doing nose-dives and other spectacular aeronautics . A little brown pheasant hen stepped daintily out of the grass and with slow unflurried movements stepped daintily back again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring winds from over the ; 94 White Bird Flyingprairies . Blowing into their young nostrils , it mignrr have been like the breath of life when man became a living soul . They were at the top of the highest of the hills between their home and Lincoln . They could see in every direction to the horizon line , which became for them a circle complete in its visible circumference . It seemed to them half the world and they the center of the hemisphere . Allen stopped the car at the side of the grassy road on the hill top . They were alone in the center of the world , ? their world . And Laura was tumbling a little of that world about Allen 's ears now by saying some strange words : " . . . go to my Uncle Harry Wentworth 's in New York . . . " " Until Christmas ? " He said the words as though Christmas were some date in a future century . " Well , I 'll be home by Christmas ; and after that , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , the biggest one of all is to write . " " Other plans ? Going to marry ? " he asked teasingly . " Oh , heavens , no . I 'm never going to marry . " " So ? " " Yes . I 've known that ever since I was twelve . " " That 's bad news . I thought . . . Laura . maybe you 'd marry me . " Laura raised frank brown eyes to Allen and then dropped them immediately . It is not given to femininity to look unabashed into the muzzle of 16oA White Bird FlyingThe Great Question , however flippantly or awkwardlythat question may have been asked . " Yo+ ? Oh , Allen ... that 's nice of you . . . and everything , if you mean it . . . " For a sudden fleeting moment , she was human enough to think of the pleasure of telling the girls at The House . " Of course , I mean it . Gee , Laura . . . I do n't know ... ever since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grandma ... " " But I . . . was n't counting on that . . . Allen . We 've been such good friends this year . " " There 's something greater than friendship . " " I know , Allen . But I could n't . . . not at all . " Aller was trying to save his self-respect , sustain a balarce between the expression of romance and his usutl cheerful banter . So he said lightly , " You could do worse . " " Yes . . . but if I did n't , I could do verse , " Laura countered . And they both laughed . Youth is youth , laughter comes easily , and the great Amer. ican Youth dearly loves his own wit . " That was n't such a good wise-crack ,  - -  but it 's true . Allen , I 'm going in for a career in good earnest . There 's something in my life that I want to confile in you about . . . " " You 're the duke 's daughter , kidnaped by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make light of it if it pleases you , Allen ; but it 's really an awfully serious thing to me . Do you remember a day , ages ago , when I was a kid , 1614 White Bird Flyingand you brought wood to Kathie 's and you saw for the first time that painting of my grandmother 's grandmother ? " " I mind as how , ' as old man Lutz would say . ' " She was my great-great-grandmother , " Laura went on . " Imagine it ! Her name was Isabelle Anders-Mackenzie , and she was one grand aristocrat . My own Grandmother Deal used to tell me how she always thought of this lovely lady , and when she was young , how the thought of her was kind of an inspiration to want to do something great , ? sing or paint or write , ? some genuinely creativething . Well , Grandmother Deal never did , ? not any of the things she planned to do when she was young . You know how she just married and came West and raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman without doing any of those things that had so inspired her when she was young . " " She was a fine old lady , " Allen said stoutly , as though he were shielding her from criticism . " Do n't I know she was , and her life in its way was full and wonderful . I think at the last she would n't have had it any different . But just the same , when she told me all that , ? her cherished hopes that never were fulfilled , I could sense that she felt she had missed something , ? and she said to me : Laura , you 'll have a fine education and you 'll do some of the things I never did . ' Well , I 'm going to , Allen . . . I 'm going to do some of the things 1624 White Bird Fryingshe never did . Now , this is the mysterious thing I was going to tell you . . . that very day you brought the wood , standing there in front of the lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little , I said that I 'd have that career which Grandmother missed , ? first of all , selfishly . . . I guess we 're all more or less self-centered. . . but secondly , for my grandmother 's sake . She had so much faith in me doing what she always wanted to do and never did . " " I 'll go down and talk to the painted dame myself . . . tell her king 's excuse , you 've changed your mind . " " Do n't make light of it , Allen ; I 'm serious . " " But that does n't keep you from marrying . " He , too , was serious agai  --  erious and earnest . " Marriagedoes n't keep women from careers now , any more than screens keep out the breeze . " " It would me . " " I thought you were modern and up-to-date . As a matter of fact , you 're as old-fashioned as the dickens . There 's nothing to keep you from going on with your writing , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on with their chosen work outside their homes . And you would n't even have to leave your home to do your kind of work . Look at your own Aunt Isabelle Rhodes in Chicago . Has n't she been a professional singer and music teacher ever since she and Harrison Rhodes were married ? " 163A White Bird Flying " Yes , but they 're different . They work together . He composes and she sings . " " Well , so could we . You 'd write , and I 'd sharpen your pencils . " Modern youth may be as romantic as the swain of other generations , but he bestows the sweets rolled up in acrid flippancy . " No , Allen . It just does n't work , ? marriage and a career . I 'll modify that statement and say , it may work for some women but it would n't for me . I would want to do one or the other well and thoroughly . " She named two famous unmarried authors . " They 're my ideals , and I 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 'll raise your bid . Three clubs . " Allen retorted , and named three equally famous ones who had married and raised families . Laura chose to ignore the scored point with : " And you 'll always live here , Allen , of course , and I could n't . " He was genuinely amazed at that and at Laura 's stating flatly : " Not here , Allen , I could n't do anythingworth while here . " " Why not ? " " Answer it yourself . What is there to write about here ? No material here and no attractive atmosphere , and atmosphere is what counts . Look at all successful literatur  --  n it the atmosphere of old New England , the atmosphere of London nights , of romantic New Orleans , of California 's Spanish missions and the goldrush , of New York 's Ghetto and Broadway and old Hudson river romances , of 164A White Bird Flyingqueer hill-billies , of Alaskan settings . The first writers who used the midwest pioneer material got all the picking  --  ust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there left here to do ? " Allen looked around rather helplessly . The late afternoon sunshine of the mellow April day touched the tips of the low rolling hills and lay in shallow lakes of light on the fields and meadows . It looked very beautiful to Allen . He felt young , alive , strong , viril  --  ne with the maples in which the sap had long been running , with the newly opened cottonwoodbuds that had burst into green life , with the fallow fields calling for the seeding , with the mating songs of robins , with swallows on the nuptial flight . " Oh , I ca n't tell , " he said helplessly . " But those things are easy for you . I should think you 'd know . It looks . . . " he waved his hand around at the landscape , " mighty good to me . " " Scenery , " Laura said , " just setting . And there 's no story in a setting . " " But the people , " Allen was stanch in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people ? " " I 'm not arguing about their characters , but just substantial people ' do n't mean a thing in the literary world . In fact , substantial people ' are about the poorest material one could find . . . there 's no dramaticinterest in them , whatever . " " If you mean they do n't kill their offspring or run away with other men 's wives , I 'm glad I do n't live in a dramatic community . " 165White Bird Flying " Oh , you do n't get the point at all , Allen . This is my home as much as yours . Do n't I love it too , every bit as much as you do ? I intend always to come back to it . But my life work call  --  ee ? If you were an explorer , for instance , you could n't stay in Cedartown to explore . " " Too deep . . . ca n't follow . " " Professor Throckmortin says it 's because there 's no spiritual uplift here . " " Spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no great beauty here ,  - -  that without mountains and seas , the monotony of the landscape brings out in Midwesterners a pessimism of the spirit and a depression of the soul , ? and that it 's reflected in our writings . " " Good Lord . Does he say that ? I 'll stack the Midwest up any time by the side of any other part of the country he 'll bring on . Think of the ten thousand lakes of Minnesota with their birch trees . . . . Tell him to go out and see the colored Bad Lands of Dakota as I did last year , and look at the Grand Canyon 's rival . Take a look at the blue skies over the sandhills of northern Nebraska when a crane flies across it . . . Look at this right here . . . Gosh , I call that a sight for sore eyes . " " Well , do n't get all hot and bothered , Allen . I like it , too . " Laura turned to take in the circle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spring afternoo  --  he whole picture of roll-166A White Bird Flyinging hills and dipping valleys , a lovely thing of greens and tans and blues , as dainty as a Corot , but painted on a canvas the size of a half world . " I love my home as much as any one , but you 'll just have to admit it 's the common or garden-variety spot of the map for atmosphere , speaking in a literary sense . " " I 'm not speaking in a literary sense ; but I 'll be darned if I 'd go back on my part of the country in anything . And , anyway , we 've wandered fourteen miles from the original argument . I 'm telling you , I love you , and you 're telling me everything about American civilization and medieval literature in answer . You 've cluttered your answer all up with other issues . What I want to tell you is , that I love you and you 're the one girl in the world for me . And what I want to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if any ? " " I think a lot of you , Allen , ? as a friend . And knowing very definitely what I 'm going to make of my life , I wo n't even analyze my feeling any further . " " Aha ! You 're afraid to . I 'm coming on . " " Not at all . I 'm just thinking of other things ; my career most of all . Going East to Uncle Harry Wentworth 's again in the summer , for another . They go about a great deal , and he 's wealthy and they 're childless . . . and Mother thinks it 's a great chance for me , and I do too . " Laura was unaware that her mother had assisted Chance materially by167fl White Bird Flyingadroitly worded letters concerning the young man in whose car she was sitting . " It reads like a story , Allen , ? it 's drama itself . I 've told you about Grandmother Deal 's aspirations that never amounted to anything . And here 's more about it : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice of two things ... came to the parting of the ways , as it were . Two men loved her and wanted to marry her . She had to choose between Grandfather , whom she really loved , or a young doctor . . . I do n't know hissname , but he became a big New York surgeon . She chose Grandfather Deal , and came out here and went through that hard pioneering with him . . . whereas , if she had chosen the doctor and gone East , she might have had the career , for she had a lovely voice . Do you see the connection ? Just like Grandmother , I 'm making my choice ... " " To get yourself a nice young surgeon ? " " No , foolish . Carry out the thing Grandmother did n't do . It was n't surprising that she did n't . Life was different then . Every one was tied down , The old inhibitions were masters of girls ' fates . She could hardly break away from any thought but doing the thing she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. . in a modern setting . . . a University education .. free . . . sort of heir of the ages , ' all that stuff , you know , ? and I can choose deliberately . But I 've got to be free . . . as free as the wind that blows , with no entanglements of any kind . " " You sound like a mule in a wire fence . " 168A White Bird Flying " Thanks , Allen . . . lovely simile . " " You 're welcome . " They both laughed , and Laura went on : " I think and eat and sleep and talk in terms of writing . " It was true . Even as she said it , that other person , who played so great a part in her life , was composingin her mind : " The girl spoke , earnestly , without emotion . . . . " " No one in my life , up to dat  --  ot my parents ? not even Miss Fisk or Professor Throckmortin , my two favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one person has had as much influence over me as my Grandmother Deal . She had me with her much of the time and she always inspired me to do something fin  --  o find what was the most worth-while thing in life and see it through . Soon after she died , I ran across a poem . It was like this : " Pain has been and grief enough and bitterness and crying , Sharp ways and stony ways I think it was she trod , But all there is to see now is a white bird flyingWhose blood-stained wings go circling big  --  ircling upto God . ' " I have n't the faintest idea what or whom theauthor meant when she wrote it , or the real significance of it . That 's the beauty of poetry , anyway . We can all put our own interpretation on it . Tome , it was my grandmother who had known thebitterness and crying and had trod the sharp and169White Bird Flyingstony ways , for her life , like all of those pioneer women , was terribly hard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , But all there is to see now is a white bird flying . ' This is the first time I 've ever told this to a soul . . . in fact , I do n't know any one else I would tell it to , Allen . . . . " " Thanks . " " Do n't mention it . " Allen grinned and Laura laughed lightly . " But that line has grown to be sort of . . . what shall I call it ? . . . an influence or an ideal or inspiration or something like that . . . to me . It 's kind of a vision of things to com  --  appiness and success in a career . A white bird flying . ' I say it to myself lots of times . . .

" I 've only one life to live , Allen , and I do so want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , was serious . There was no laughter , now , for either . He slipped an arm around her and caught up her hands . " And does n't a home of your own and all it means . . . does n't it seem to give the most out of life ' ? Ca n't you see that it would ? " " No , Allen , " she shook her head . " I can see nothing at all . . . " She smiled up at his face bent low over her own . " . . . Nothing at all but a white bird flying . " CHAPTER XVIiJTHE month of May brought all of those final events so important to college students . One of the early dates was Ivy Day . When the smoke of battle had cleared , Bernice Fowler , efficient and capable Mortar Board , emerged triumphant as May Queen . Many of the co-eds on the campus shrugged their shoulders and said it was an empty honor , the result of intensive political strategy . Most of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes . A shower in the morning , swift and sudden , threatening disastrous results for a time , suddenly stopped and left in its wake glorious sunshine and a sparkling campus . Suddenly there were the townspeopleand students massing themselves for the annual parade . There were the processional by the military band and girls carrying the daisy chain entering the green triangle set aside for the ceremonies , a chorus of sorority representatives singing " Who will plant the Ivy ? " and the pages announcing on silver trumpets the entrance of the queen . There was a great white throne encompassed about , not quite with angels , but by pretty co-eds in appearance falling not far short of that appellation . There were170 .7t11 White Bird Flyingthe crowning of the Queen , the competitive interfraternitysing , the reading of the Ivy Day poem , the giving of the Ivy Day oration and the planting of the traditional ivy plant . In the outside world stocks went up and down , stores sold their commodities , hospitals cared for their sick , ships sailed to far countries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , a little world that had eyes only for the traditional exercises , and for the tappingof the Innocents and the masking of the Mortar Boards , with all their attendant enthusiasms and disappointments . Now that the time was coming to leave , it seemed to Laura a far sadder occasion than . she had dreamed . She had a recurrence of the same feeling she had known when she was to be thrust out of the grades into High School , when she was to be pushed out of Cedartown into the University . Now , it seemed she could go on longer here more easily than she could take another new step . The month of May and the few days of June remaining on the school calendar passed into the shadows of days gone by . And Laura was in cap and gown in the huge coliseum where she had registeredfour short years before , standing with several hundred others , and hearing the Chancellor pronouncethe end . Then she was home , and Cedartown seemed strangely quiet and uneventful , the blue and white room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 172 ? White Bird Flyingold grape arbor nothing but a shelter from the sun . She set the first of August for the date to leave home for Uncle Harry 's . In the meantime , she assisted her mother with the homely daily tasks , read and wrote , strolled down to Kathie 's often , chatted some with old Oscar Lutz , and drove almost every evening with Allen . Allen seemed older and more mature this summer . Away from the University , he had lost a little of that snappy way which had always come to him so readily . He seemed more serious , talking often about his work to Laura . To her surprise , she found herself growing interested in his experiments with feeding , his plans to set out a grove of walnut trees in his lower pasture , the success he was having with sudan grass , and she grieved with him over what he termed a piece of blundering on his part , losing some sheep with sweet-clover bloat . He talked no more of his love for her , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as though some great change might have taken place in her mind by that time . Any reference to this , Laura only evaded , putting aside the thoughts that came to her as one avoids unpleasant realities . June and part of July drifted along dreamily enough . Sometimes Laura chided herself for being a two-faced person who pretended one thing even as she planned another . She ought to tell Allen all about that trip to Uncle Harry 's . She ought not let him look forward to Christmas as he173 III jA White Bird Flyingwas doing . Just as Allen was too fine to be trifled with in any foolish , flirtatious way , so was he to fine to be hurt by the bungling of a friendship . Sometimesshe wakened in the night , thought of herself with deepest scorn , and decided to tell him the truth . When she saw him again she would lose her courage , and all her nocturnal resolutions would go into nothing . Sometimes she thought she would talk to Kathie about it . But she and Kathie lived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousin , she was admitting this summer that she was disappointed in her . Always light-hearted and gay , Kathie seemed more than that now . There was something strangely restless about her . She went to Omaha too often , and left Patty with Verna . It was as though both Cedartown and Omaha were her homes and she must attend every social event in each . She and Jimmie were seldom out together any more . The banking proposition had been a hard one the past few years and Jimmie , serious and conscientious as always , was giving the business the best that was in him . Uncle Mack came down often and together they would go over the notes . Laura had often heard her Uncle say , " The heart of the bank is the note-case . A good banker keeps his note-case clean , just as a housekeeper keeps her kitchen clean . " And Jimmie , with his inclination to put his whole soul in anything , had been giving his every thought to keepingthe bank in good condition in these perilous174A White Bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not think it necessary that he give it so much thought and worry . She made sport of his conscientious endeavors , and not always with good taste . Several times Laura suspected that she openly embarrassed him before their friends . Lately she had been going to Omaha for longer periods , leaving Verna to take the entire charge of Patty . Laura disliked to speak of it to her mother , for Eloise was radical in her criticism , and Laura was genuinely fond of Kathie , even when she was disappointed in her . Old Oscar had changed too , this summer , but his was the natural change of age . He seemed much more feeble than at this time last year , Laura thought , as she lay in the hammock watching him now , fussing among his roses . Poor old man . He would be gone one of these days . She ought to do something for him . " I 'll walk over and let him talk to me , " she told herself , " that 's about the biggest treat any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him . " It was true . He was delighted beyond measure to see her slip through the opening in the privet hedge . There were low-hanging clouds in the west and when she spoke about it , the suggestion opened up a whole stream of talk : " Speakin ' of storms , ? " He sat down on the edge of the porch , and was off on a monologue highly pleasing to himself , if not his audience . " You know that there big cottonwood left standin ' north of the cemetery ? Well , I 'll tell175A White Bird Flyingyou somethin ' about that . Marthy 's and my first old house stood right over there a few yards beyond the pasture fence north of the cemetery . That big cottonwood up there on the hill is the last one of those I planted . It 's powerful old . . . I could figger it up exact , but I wo n't stop . I mind as how , if I was away from the house in the field or at the barn or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd always hot-foot it up for the house . She was always scairt o ' storms . Never got over it . Lived through Injuns coming , rattlesnakes in the yard , wind and snow and blizzards . Never complained about ' em . But let a thunder and lightnin ' storm come up and she was just a little girl . Always was . I mind as how , I never could see a storm comin ' without droppin ' everything and hurryin ' up to the house to her . After she died . . . the first time there was a storm . . . Queer ! . . . I come hurryin ' home here . There she was . . . gone .. . safe , you might say , from storm . . . but could n't get over she was waitin ' for me to come and stay with her . " In his tiresome old way he was repeating : " When we lived out there in that first house , no matter whether I was in the north cornfield . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . I 'd always come up there through the draw . If it got dark , she 'd set two lights in the windows . We had a kitchen with two windows about three . . . four .. . feet apart . " He measured it off with his hand and 176A White Bird Flyingthe hoe . " There was a little cupboard atween the two windows . And if it got dark she 'd set a light in each one . Always said most any one would have a light in one window , but I need never mistake anybody 's lights for ours on a dark night , for she 'd always have them two , about three . . . four .. . feet apart . Used to joke her quite a little about that . Marthy , ' I 'd say , suppose I 'd come home tighter ' n ' a fiddle some night . . . and be seein ' double and get in the wrong house ? ' " And he laughed his high cracked old laugh . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd hot-foot it up there , and when I 'd get to the top o ' the knoll where the big cottonwood tree still stands , I 'd hoo-hoo and call out to her I was comin ' . And when I 'd come in she 'd run to me and say : ' My ! Oscar ! I 'm glad you 're home . Now I 'm not afraid . ' " He said it diffidently , almost shyly , like a young lover . Laura looked at him , so old , so gaunt , with his huge bent frame and his ashengraycheeks flabbily wrinkled above his beard . How queer ! How could one , as old as that , remember ? How could love for another last through the years like that ? " Queer , how all three little girls had to die one after the other . " He was evidently speaking of his own children now . " One was diphtheria . . . never heard of anti-toxin . See her just choke up and die . One was tuberculosis . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what to do . . . lust stuff177A White Bird Flyingup the cracks in the window so she would n't get night air . One was probably appendicitis , but never heard of it , just called it acute inflammation ' and watched her go , too . Queer ! Us old codgers ai n't got any call to say times ai n't better now . " Suddenly he said , with complete change of sub , ject : " I used to play a jew's-harp : There Was an Old Miller Who Lived by the Mill ' and Comm ' Thru the Rye . ' " Childish , Laura thought . First you were a little child , and then you were mature , and then you were a child again . Well , that thought was n't new . Others had thought that all out long ago . Second childishness and mere oblivion , sans teeth , sans eyes , sans taste , sans everything . An  --  esire shall fade and man goeth to his long home . CHAPTER XVIILAURA had one more week at home and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wanted to make the most of it , to hold it to her heart as one fondles a precious thing . There was something vaguely painful in seeing her father come home from the office , care-worn and tired , and her mother go monotonously over all the household tasks each day . They would miss her . But so would they miss her no matter what she might be doing away from them . She felt a sort of patient fondness for Trib , now that so soon she was to see him no more . Trib was seventeen now , ? a queer mixture of man and boy . All his young life he had ridden hobbiesup hills of enthusiasm , abandoned them one by one , and trudged down into valleys of neglect , only to find there steeds of different hue and temperament . One year it had been an enthusiasm for carpentering , in which he had made countless toot chests and benches and more or less wobbly pieces of lattice-work . One year he had been an embryo naturalist , every waking moment spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nests for them , every spoken sentence a statement concerning his feathered friends . He had filled all179ijfl White Bird Flyingavailable places with wrens ' nests , made a martin house large enough for all the relatives , both blood and law , that might arrive , and built various fancy habitations for bluebirds , brown thrashers and flickers . When the winged bipeds for which the houses were intended failed to understand his kind motives , and the sparrows moved in en masse , Trib abandonedthe whole interest with superb scorn . There had been a year of photography , with part of the cellar curtained off into dungeon-like quarters , where one , venturing in , fell over old magic lanterns and electric light bulbs , became entangled in coils of wire and rolls of films . Eloise had been in a state of exasperation and actual concern over these variousinterests , dilating long and with much detail upon her difficulties with Trib . This summer he had grown strangely quiet and read too many lightweightmagazines . Laura , looking at his sleek dark head bent over one , felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vague disquietude that she was not to be near him any more , not again to be an amused and exasperated onlooker at those boyish enthusiasms . July was slipping away in a procession of hot " corn weather " days . It made Laura think in contrastof the lovely times in the northern woods . She wished her father and mother might go up there , but the former seemed tied always to the day 's grind and the latter with martyr-like spirit stayed by him , though she called attention quite frequently to the180A White Bird Flyinggrace she exhibited in so doing . Some day , Laura thought , she would be in a position to take them all on such a trip , and others still more interesting . It gave her a warm feeling of contentment for her lot . In the late afternoon of one of these last July days , dressing in cool white after her bath , Laura decided as she slipped into the fresh things , to go down to Kathie 's . She could not have known the disturbing conditions in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Jimmie was home from the bank , with the information that he was going to Lincoln on a business trip . Katherine had expected Jimmie to go with her on one of her all-too-frequent Omaha social journeyings , ? and Jimmie was not going . Furthermore , ? andaye , there was the rub , ? Jimmie was quite frankly saying that he thought Kathie ought not to go either , that the weather was hot and Patty needed her . Words , which at first were only ironicallypolite , grew into words that were strong and bitter , ? incriminations , ? denunciations . And now Jimmie was stooping and kissing four-year-old Patty , giving one of her light corkscrew curls a playful pull , saying with pronounced sarcasm : " If your business interferes with your pleasure , Patty-girl , put off your business , " and cool and calm with no word to Katherine , walking on out of the house . Katherine 's temper rose in a perfect storm of anger . So this was what their marriage had come to , had it ? They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new house , discouraged buying the banking interest if it were purely on his account , absolutely refused the gift of a car for himself . She would take the afternoon train to Omaha , and when she returned , some one of the old crowd would take pity on her and drive her back . She enjoyed the pitiful thought of herself accepting a charity ride from some one . She would come back this time . But not for long . Not for long . There would be a lot of things to see to and then she would take Patty and go home for good . To take Patty away from Jimmie ! That would punish him more than anything in the world . Evidently he did n't care anything about her any more . It would n't be any punishment for him to lose her . He could be free then to go and pick out some prissy thing that would cook and bake and scrub and have his babies . That was the kind of girl he wanted . Maybe he had her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him suffer to lose Patty . She was cramming things in the bags . She finished packing , took her bath , and gave directions to Verna about Patty . It was then that Laura came in . Katherine 's fury rose again . Now that she had Laura to talk to , she freed her mind of countless bitter things : " Imagine ! Dictating to me ! Telling me I can and ca n't do this or that . Insinuating I 'm neglecting his child . What child ever had the care 184A White Bird FlyingPatty has ? Tell me that . Neither you nor I. Dr. Rayburn for one thing , Dr. Moss for another , Miss Lawrence 's model pre-kindergarten school . He said I cared more about playing bridge when she was at the pre-kindergarten school than I did the psychologyof it I was always pretending I was interested in . He said , Psychology be damned . A baby needs her mother and not a scientific textbook . ' He said she 'll always remember Verna more than she will me , ? that Verna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The words tumbled over each other in their harshness and anger . Laura had never seen Kathie in such a state and the sight was unlovely . She was deeply astonished and grieved and so embarrassed that it seemed she could not endure the sensation . Kathie and Jimmie ! She had loved them , idolized them . Ever since they were married they had seemed to stand for all that was attractive and ideal . Fine , clean , upstanding Jimmie , and lovely , laughing Kathie . She thought of them as the bride and groom who had settled in this beautiful little home a few short years ago . With an ache in her heart so intense that it hurt her very body , she listened to Kathie 's tirade , dully watched her write and tear up and rewrite several notes to Jimmie in the vain hope of getting one which would be scornful enough to suit her . She saw her kiss Patty good-by , give Verna a final directionand leave . All the way on the train to Omaha , Katherine 185A White Bird FlyingBuchanan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readiness to tell her mother . At seven , she was in Omah  --  t seven-twenty in her girlhood 's lovely home . Emma Deal was delighted to see her daughter , her youngest child . Emma in her sixties , now , was gray haired , beautifully preserved with all the modernpreservation that money can accomplish . She had a complacent , easy , good-natured way about her which gave her a certain serenity . " Dad 's not here , " were almost her first words . " Has to miss the party . Larry Albrett and the Millers are going with us . " " Where is Dad ? " Katherine 's head ached a littlefrom emotional fatigue . " Lincoln . A called bank meeting . He phoned just before he left . " Her mother was serene , unruffled . Katherine emitted a feeble " Well ! Jimmie 's gone , too . " Suddenly it seemed a little ridiculous to tell her mother all she had intended . It was rather flat to blow in with a tale of being the victim of a tyranny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and find her mother apparently a victim of the same cruelty , and taking it as unconcernedly as though it were of no consequence . However , that did not account for the other bitter things Jimmie had said , ? those about her neglect of Patty . She steeled herself against the thought of him . So Larry Albrett was going to be in the party , was he ? Larry 186A White Bird Flyinghad liked her a lot at one time . And Larry was fun . Later , in her own old room , she slipped the rose-colored gown over her creamy white shoulders and looked at her slim , supple figure in the glass . " Kathie , you do n't look a day older than when you left home , " she told the lovely girl , looking out at her . " But you would . . . " She curled a scornful lip , " You would , if you took your family as seriously as Jimmie thinks you should . " Laura went home from Kathie 's in such an unhappystate that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegiance to Kathie which she always possessed , she would not tell her mother of the agitated scene . She was in her blue-and-white room with closed doors , trying to settle her own agitation before helping her mother with the supper . As much as she thought of Kathie , she knew Kathie was the one to blame . Jimmie was fine . Jimmie had no doubt said bitter things . But they were true . Kathie was in the wrong . She did n't pay much attention to Jimmie or Patty or her house any more . Over and over she thought of the miserablyunhappy atmosphere in the lovely little house , all the more bitter for the contrasting thoughts of the happiness she had seen there . " I guess Tennysonwas right , " she said to herself , " that a sorrow 's crown of sorrow is remembering happier days .

If it were she and Alle  --  hey would not have handled the situationso poorly . They would have ? She called back her truant thoughts sharply , soundly provoked at their strange stampede , and concentrated on Kathie and Jimmie . Kathie was selfish . She had always had everything she wanted . And now , having everything , she was restless and self-centered . Jimmie , having stood a great deal , had evidently exploded to-day . So that was marriage ! Luckily she was not going into it . She went downstairs with the sensationof an emotional depression too deep for comfort . CHAPTER XVIIIKATHERINE went back to her home late in the evening of the second day . Larry Albrett drove her down . The night was lovely . Larry , who had " thought a lot " of Kathie , once , had not changed . Which is to say he was still single , still flitting about taking his pleasures where he found them , still thinking a lot of Kathie . At least so he told Kathie . And Kathie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flesh pots tremendously , listened . The night was lovely and she was a little foolish . It was very late when they drove up to the house . Lights shone from Verna 's room and from the upper hall . Kathie had a swift intuition then that something was not right , but put it aside , and asked Larry in . She was not going to slip in like a young girl sending her lover away , she told herself . Whether Jimmie liked it or not made no great difference now . They went in , and Kathie , excusing herself , ranit upstairs to see how everything was after the twodays ' absence . Jimmie was not in his room . Sheslipped down the soft carpeted hall to Verna 's room . it Verna was there in a chair and Jimmie in pajamas and robe was bending low over her , his arms . .. Oh , not that ! Not Jimmie !
