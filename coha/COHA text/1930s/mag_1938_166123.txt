In London 's famed Madame Tussaud 's all the great characters of history are exhibited in wax . On Broadway this season much the same thing is being done in grease paint . Already Abraham Lincoln , Jesse James , Pieter Stuyvesant , Gilbert &; Sullivan , Marie Antoinette , Queen Victoria and Oscar Wilde have been on view ; * this week brings Danton and Robespierre ; the next few weeks promise Henry IV , Henry V , Henry VI , Richard III , General Howe , Queen Elizabeth , Madame Jumel , Lord Byron , Herod and Harriet Beecher Stowe . <P> Such a run on the history books is abnormal . For , despite the theatre 's love of dressing up , historical plays are notoriously bad box office . But if the success of such plays as Oscar Wilde and Abe Lincoln in Illinois is due to competent writing and first-rate acting , the vogue for historical plays in general is really a commentary on the times . With war , fascism , strikes , depressions bearing down on all sides , playwrights and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and plays laid in the settled past offer a ready form of escape . <P> Some historical plays , to be sure , are made of sterner stuff and use the past for what it can say to the present . In Abe Lincoln in Illinois , Playwright Sherwood beats the drum for liberal democracy ; in Knickerbocker Holiday , the author of High Tor gives comfort to high Tories . <P> But even if such plays have a message they proclaim it in broad enough terms to avoid the narrowly controversial or flagrantly partisan . And this is significant , not least as box office ; for , if , in the commercial theatre , the historical play is a gamble , the " propaganda play " is an out-and-out luxury . <P> <P> * Queen Victoria and Wilde have appeared twice : in the plays bearing their names , and together in Knights of Song .
