IS THERE a way to keep America out of war ? If there is such a thing as intelligence left in the craniums of mankind , a thing so monstrous as another modern world war must be avoided . There certainly is no moral justification for war between civilized nations . No moralist or philosopher worthy of the name in modern times has ever been able to defend it . The veriest jingo in the United States does not dare to stand upon any public platform and attempt to justify war as such . The peoples of the whole world abhor it . Yet it is apparent to any student of international affairs that the post-war era has come to an end , and that the world is once again in that precarious condition in which the bad temper of a dictator , the ineptness of a diplomat , or the crime of a fanatic may let loose irremediable disaster . As these words are being written , early in October , the conflict in Ethiopia has already begun . No one knows how fast or how far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely the first of a series of conflagrations that will roar from continent to continent . But of this we may be sure : if the flames sweep Europe there will be mighty forces presently at work ? forces of cunning or desperate diplomacy , of propaganda , of greed , and of thoughtless patriotism ? to force us too into the insane debacle to preserve our fancied honor , or freedom of the seas , or " neutral rights . " At present the desire to keep the United States from becoming involved in any war between foreign nations seems practically unanimous among  | the rank and file of American citizens ; but it must be remembered there was an almost equally strong demand to keep us out of the last war . In August , 1914 , few could have conceived that America would be dragged into a European conflict in which we had no original part and the ramifications of which we did not even understand . Even as late as November , 1916 , President Wilson was reelected because he " kept us out of war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save the world for democracy " in the " war to end war . " In the light of that experience , and in the red glow of war fires burning in the old countries , it is high time we give some thought to the hard , practical question of just how we propose to stay out of present and future international conflicts . No one who has made an honest attempt to face the issue will assert that there is an easy answer . But if we have learned anything at all , we know the inevitable and tragic end to a policy of drifting and trusting to luck . We know that however strong is the will of the American people to refrain from mixing in other people 's quarrels , that will can be made effective only if we have a sound , definite policy from the beginning . Such a policy must be built upon a program to safeguard our neutrality . No lesson of the World War is more clear than that such a policy can not be improvised after war breaks out . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late to apply reason . I contend with all possible earnestness that if we want to avoid being drawn into this war now forming , or any other future war , we must formulate a definite , workable policy of neutral relations with belligerent nations . Some of us in the Senate , particularly the members of the Munitions Investigation Committee , have delved rather deeply into the matter of how the United States has been drawn into past wars , and what forces are at work to frighten us again into the traps set by Mars . As a result of these studies , Senator Nye and I introduced the three proposals for neutrality legislation which were debated so vigorously in the last session of the Congress . A part of that legislative program was battered through both houses in the closing hours of the session late in August ; a very vital part of it was held in abeyance . Senator Nye and I made no claims then , and make none now , that the neutrality proposals will provide an absolute and infallible guarantee against our involvement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can stay out of war if it wants to , and if its citizens understand what is necessary to preserve our neutrality . We feel that the temporary legislation already passed and the legislation we shall vigorously push at the coming session of the Congress point the only practical way . II Let us examine that legislation briefly . It will be recalled that the three resolutions I have mentioned provided for mandatory embargoes upon munitions and implements of war to belligerent nations ; for positive prohibition of loans and credits to warring countries ; and for the extension of embargoes to contraband articles other than those strictly defined as war implements . The resolutions were not hastily drawn . They came as the result of long and patient study of the whole question of those forces which draw nations into war ? particularly as to who gets the " profits " from war . But our proposals were pounced upon immediately and vigorously by those who did not want any neutrality legislation  | and by some who thought the provisions were too stringent . One camp contended that mandatory power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtail loans and credits , and to prohibit shipments of articles declared contraband would never do . It should be left permissive at the discretion of the President of the United States to exercise those duties . Some shouted to high heaven that our nation should by all means be left free to co-operate with other nations in " pressure " against aggressors to prevent war , and that mandatory neutrality would violate a lot of fine American foreign-policy traditions . It would . That is what I ? speaking for myself ? hoped it would do . Our neutrality policies have not only failed to keep us out of foreign quarrels , but certainly dragged us into the War of 1812 and the World War . Unless changed , they will drag us into every major war of the future . All the fine jousting of parliamentary battle was necessary to get any legislation passed by the present Congress . There loomed ahead of our proposals an uncertain fate in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . There awaited them the bitter and relentless opposition of the munitions makers , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was to be taken into account the attitude of the Administration itself , which , expressed by both President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Cordell Hull , strongly favored permissive powers instead of mandatory provisions . As finally passed , the joint resolution on neutrality provides for t e pro I MT ' of the exportation of arms , ammunition , and implements of war to belligerent countries ; the prohibition of the transportation of arms , ammunition , and implements of war by vessels of the United States for the use of belligerent nations ; for the registration and licensing of persons engaged in the manufacturing , exporting or importing of arms , ammunition and implements of war , at all times ; and for the restriction of travel by American citizens on belligerent ships during war . The act is to terminate February 29 , 1936 . It is a stop-gap only . But it is pointing the way we intend to go . The President is empowered to enumerate definitely the arms , munitions , and implements of war , the exportation of which is prohibited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this enumeration in a proclamation , following closely the list submitted to the disarmament conference at Geneva in our government 's proposals for international control of the munitions industry . A National Munitions Control Board has been established , composed of the Secretaries of State , Treasury , War , Navy , and Commerce , with the administration of the board in the Department of State . It is contemplated that by November 29th , when the Act takes effect , the manufacturers and exporters of war implements will all be listed in the office of this board . After that date such materials as are specified may not be exported without a license issued by the board to cover such shipment . This will , obviously , permit the government to prohibit shipments to belligerent nations . The act makes it unlawful for any American vessel to " carry arms , ammunition , or implements of war to any port of the belligerent countries named in such proclamation as being at war , or to any neutral port for transshipment to , or for use in , a belligerent country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to restrict the use of American ports and waters to submarines of foreign nations in the event such use might disturb our position of neutrality , and to proclaim the condi- tions under which American citizens on belligerent ships during war must travel entirely at their own risk . Two provisions from our original program failed to pass : prohibition of loans and credits to belligerent nations , and the application of strict embargoes upon contraband materials other than munitions and war implements . These are the unfinished items of our neutrality proposals , and I shall discuss them presently . III It was inevitable that our munitions investigations should follow the trail that led us up to the brink of war in 1917 . From the lesson of that study our new neutrality program was largely drawn . One is forced to the conclusion that our statesmen and our people knew very little about the forces ready to draw us into war when the conflict broke in Europe in 1914 . President Wilson issued his proclamation of neutrality and we went on with business as usual , in the happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the mess . Our professional diplomats were not much more astute . They assumed that all we had to do to keep out was to observe the rules of international law and insist upon our neutral rights . About two weeks after the outbreak of hostilities our State Department issued a public circular on the rights and duties of a neutral in wartime . It took the position that " the existence of war between foreign governments does not suspend trade or commerce between this country and those at war . " It told American merchants that there was nothing in international law to prevent them from trading with the warring nations . It told munitions makers that they were free to sell their war materials to either or both sides . It took no steps to warn American citizens of the dangers of travel on vessels of the warring nations , even after passenger ships had been sunk without warning . This attitude , strange as it may seem to-day , was in full accord with the rules of international law as generally understood at that time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about both war and neutrality . From all the study of that World War drama , four conclusions stand out in my mind : ( 1 ) That a policy based on defense of our so-called neutral rights led us into serious diplomatic controversy with the Allies and the Central Powers , and in the end brought us to a point where we were compelled to choose between surrendering these rights or fighting to defend them . In 1917 we chose to fight . ( 2 ) That " national honor " and the " prestige " of the nation are inevitably involved when American ships are sunk on the high seas ? even though the owners of these ships and their cargoes are private citizens seeking to profit from other nations ' wars . Passions are quickly aroused when American lives are lost ? even though the citizens who took passage on belligerent ships knew in advance the risks they ran . ( 3 ) That the economic forces set in motion by our huge war trade with the Allies made it impossible to maintain that " true spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outbreak of the conflict . ( 4 ) That among these economic forces , those which involved us most deeply were the huge trade in arms and ammunition and other war materials with the Allies . I have called the present neutrality act a stop-gap . But it has not stopped the activities of our American warmunitions makers anxious for profits from imminent conflicts . Reports from centers of manufacturing and ex- porting of war implements all tell the same story : there is a boom in war preparations . Chambers of commerce in cities with large war-materials plants proudly report reemployment of skilled munitions makers in large numbers , the stepping up of output to as high as three hundred per cent , the rushing to completion of new additions to plants . Day-and-night shifts in the brass and copper mills , rising prices and large shipments of these metals , and the acquisition of large capital for immediate wartime scale production , all indicate that Mars has waved his magic wand in our direction . Where are these war-implements shipments going ? There is no proof that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will prohibit shipments to belligerents after November 29th , but it stands to reason they are making hay while the sun shines . Our Munitions Investigation Committee has not had time to look into immediate developments , but it needs no stretch of imagination to contemplate the rich profits that would flow from an Italian-Ethiopian war , with England jumping into the fray against Italy , and other European nations following suit on one side or the other . And , of course , there 's lots of war business right here at home . We have increased our expenditures on our Army and Navy in preparation for another and more dreadful war more rapidly than any European country in the period since the World War . In 1914 the total cost of our Army and Navy combined amounted to $348 , - 000,000 . For this year we authorized the expenditure of $821,000,000 in two bills for the support of our armed forces ? an increase of more than 130 per cent over 1914 . With the funds which will be allotted under the Works Relief Bill and those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our expenditures this year will run far in excess of a billion dollars . To a large extent our professional military men have been allowed to dictate not only our military policy but our national and foreign policies as well . We have been very free to criticize the militarism of other countries dominated by military or naval cliques . We ought now to recognize that we have submitted more docilely to being plundered by ship builders and other purveyors of munitions than have other peoples . I would not be understood in any way to reflect on the character or the patriotism of the officers and men of our military and naval services . They are quite uniformly men of courage and honesty and patriotism . But they habitually assert that the country can be saved only by increases in armament . They are the last who should be permitted to decide our foreign policy . To the fact that the delegations from all nations to all disarmament conferences have been accompanied by squads of admirals and generals the failure of those conferences may be directly attributed . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neutrality act on February 29th , the battle for a practical policy of neutrality will have to be fought all over again . We who believe that the detour around another devastating war is to be found only in new conceptions of neutrality will fight for the retention of the present legislation and for the passage of the two items left out in the cold at the adjournment of the Congress . I firmly believe , whatever the status of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute at that time , whatever the position of other European powers as belligerents or as neutrals , that the United States of America can not turn back to a policy of so-called neutrality that finally pulls us into conflict with one or all the  | belligerents . Surely it is obvious that the legislation forcing mandatory embargoes upon war materials will serve to check the growth of another vast munitions trade with warring powers and the dangers that follow a swing of our foreign trade in favor of our munitions customers and against those who can not purchase the munitions . Why shall we contend for embargoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and credits to belligerents ? Because it takes these two items to complete any sort of workable neutrality program . If we are in earnest about neutrality we may as well plan to be neutral . The futility of the old plan should be apparent . As a neutral in 1914 , we claimed the right to trade in war materials and all other goods with the warring nations . This right ? with two main exceptions ? had been recognized under the rules of international law which had grown up over more than a hundred years . The exceptions were important : A warring nation had the right ? a right which we recognized ? to capture goods called " contraband . " Originally " contraband " consisted of guns and explosives and other munitions intended for the use of the armed forces . Great Britain , for example , had a legal right to stop an American ship on the high seas if it could prove that the vessel carried munitions bound for Germany . In 1909 the leading sea powers drew up a list of contraband in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Declaration of London . When the World War broke out , however , this declaration had not been put into force by any of the Governments . When our State Department asked the British Government whether it would accept the list of contraband articles in the Declaration of London , the British declined . They argued that under modern conditions of war , food and raw materials , and almost anything except ostrich feathers , which were sent to the enemy peoples , were as important as guns and explosives for the army . Modern war is not merely a contest between armies on the field of battle . It involves the entire population of nations and becomes a death struggle in which the warring country tries to overcome the will of the enemy to resist . Anything which helps the enemy to carry on the war is of vital importance . It was from the vast extension of the term " contraband " by both the Allies and the Central Powers , combined with the expansion of the doctrine of " continuous voyage , " that most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed enlarged rights to interfere with our trade with other neutral countries . On the British list of contraband compiled November 5 , 1915 , were 299 articles of absolute contraband and 78 of conditional contraband . The latter category was dropped within a few months , and in the list presented to Parliament in April , 1916 , there were 170 categories of absolute contraband , representing far more than the former list of 299 because of the fact that many separate articles were combined in each category . France and Germany paralleled the British action and made equally extensive additions to the list of contraband . By the end of 1916 Great Britain had placed almost every article exported by the United States on the lists of contraband . Our State Department protested that the British had no right to change the old rules of international law . We sent a stream of indignant notes to London . But Great Britain was engaged in a death struggle and knew that one way to win the war was to starve the enemy . Our notes fell on deaf ears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | Our government protested even more violently to Germany . While British ships were seizing contraband and taking American vessels into port , German submarines were sinking merchant ships on sight . The Imperial German Government argued that their submarine campaign was the only effective means of combating the Allied blockade which was starving the German people . They complained bitterly against the blockade and they protested our huge trade in munitions and war materials with the Allies . Public opinion in the United States became inflamed at the ruthless destruction of unarmed merchant ships and passenger vessels . When the Lusitania was sunk in May , 1915 , with the loss of one hundred and twentyfour American lives , our patriots began to shout for a strong policy . President Wilson parried with diplomatic notes , and for a time Germany offered to compromise . No one , it seems , thought of asking whether private American citizens in pursuit of fat profits had a right to involve us in war . In the end we were led to the point where we had to choose : we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or we could give up those rights and stay out . Monsieur Tardieu , subsequently French premier and cabinet member , saw the situation very clearly during the War . He has said : " Colonel House had vainly tried to make the belligerents understand the American refusal to distinguish between violations of international law . ' Neither London nor Berlin admitted this fairness . And if an attempt had been made to force both sides to admit it , a break with both sides would have been the result . To break with every one because unwilling to break with any , such was the paradox to which Wilsonian diplomacy led . To remain logical with itself , it would have had to declare two wars instead of one , as some people jump into the river to keep out of the rain . Robert Lansing frankly admitted it on December 23 , 1916 , when he told the Washington correspondents : Our rights are more and more traversed by the belligerents on both sides . We are getting nearer and nearer the brink of war . ' Which war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States wanted two enemies , it had to choose one . Neutrality was admittedly a failure . " The only logical result of attempting to enforce neutral " rights , " as they were described , was to get us into war with both sides or to force us to join hands with one violator of our rights against another . On April 6 , 1917 , Congress declared that a state of war existed between the United States and Germany . Thus we got into the war on the side of those with whom we were doing a business of billions of dollars , yet they , too , had violated our neutral rights . Let us foresee that under conditions of modern warfare everything supplied to the enemy population has the same effect as supplies to the enemy army , and will become contraband . Food , clothing , lumber , leather , chemicals ? everything , in fact , with the possible exception of sporting goods and luxuries ( and these aid in maintaining civilian " morale " ) ? are as important aids to winning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our ships carrying contraband will be seized , bombed from the air or sunk by submarines . Let us not claim as a right what is an impossibility . The only way we can maintain our neutral rights is to fight the whole world . If we are not prepared to do that we can only pretend to enforce our rights against one side , and go to war to defend them against the other side . We might at least abandon pretense . On the matter of loans and credits to belligerents , the train of events which pulled us into the World War is  | equally significant . Correspondence which our Munitions Investigation Committee discovered in the files of the State Department offers illuminating proof that there can be no true neutrality when our nation is allowed to finance one side of a foreign war . One letter , written by Secretary Robert Lansing to President Wilson , dated September 5 , 1915 , lucidly points out that loans for the Allies were absolutely necessary to enable them to pay for the tremendous trade in munitions , war materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that trade would have to stop . He declared that the Administration 's " true spirit of neutrality " must not stand in the way of the demands of commerce . About one month later the first great loan ? the Anglo-French loan of $500,000,000 ? was floated by a syndicate headed by J. P. Morgan and Company . This company had been the purchasing agents for Allied supplies in the United States since early in 1915 . Other loans to the Allied powers quickly followed . Our Committee is pressing further the investigation of American loans and credits to Allied nations during the World War , and I can say with confidence that in the coming session of the Congress our findings will present irrefutable proof of the influence of the big money lenders and money changers in drawing us into the conflict . One statement needs no proof to intelligent men : You can not finance one side of a war and remain neutral ! IV " But , think of the profits ! " cry our theorists . " America will never give up her lucrative trade in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Ernest Angell in a recent discussion in HARPER 's asserted : " The American public is not prepared to pay the price of complete abstention from trade with belligerents , and only at that price can neutrality be effectively preserved . " I am quite prepared to admit that this program involves the sacrifice of transitory profits . I do not know how the American people will receive these neutrality efforts , but I feel they are worth presenting . I contend that profits are not worth the cost of involvement in another World War . I contend that all the profits of all the wars are not worth the cost of them . I would ask those who compile the figures to show how profitable in trade in munitions and necessities another war would be , who point to a " profit " to the United States of five billion dollars from trade with the Allies in 1914-1918 , to take a look at the twenty billion dollars of debt ? and the world depression ? we got in return . Just who profited from the last war ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high wages and steady jobs . But where is labor to-day with its fourteen million unemployed ? Agriculture received high prices for its products during the period of the War and has been paying the price of that brief inflation in the worst and longest agri-cultural depression in all history . Industry made billions in furnishing the necessities of war to the belligerents and then suffered terrific reaction like the dope addict 's morning after . War and depression ? ugly , misshapen inseparable twins ? must be considered together . Each is a catapult for the other . The present world-wide depression is a direct result of the World War . Every war in modern history has been followed by a major depression . Therefore I say , let the man seeking profits from war or the war-torn countries do so at his own risk . A business representative of Swift &; Company was shot in Cuba a year or two ago , and our war party started talking of military intervention . Every man profit- bent or impelled by idle curiosity in the war-torn areas of the world carries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys . He can be made the cause for war . His profits from the warring countries are his own business ; let his risk be his own business too . If there are those so brave as to risk getting us into war by traveling in the war zones ? if there are those so valiant that they do not care how many people are killed as a result of their traveling , let us tell them , and let us tell the world that from now on their deaths will be a misfortune to their own families alone , not to the whole nation . The profiteers and others who oppose any rational neutrality shout : " You would sacrifice our national honor ! " Some declare we are about to haul down the American flag , and in a future war the belligerents will trample on our rights and treat us with contempt . Some of these arguments are trundled out by our naval bureaucracy . The admirals , I am told , objected strenuously when the State Department suggested a new policy of neutrality somewhat along these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that our national honor demands that we must sacrifice the flower of our youth to safeguard the profits of a privileged few . I deny that it is necessary to turn back the hands of civilization to maintain our national honor . I repudiate any such definition of honor . Is it not time for every lover of our country to do the same thing ?  |
