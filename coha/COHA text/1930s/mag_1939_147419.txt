Baldwin-Anderson <P> Sirs : You quote Earl Baldwin of Bewdley as saying in two long paragraphs and 175 words ( TIME , Aug. 28-Education ) what Maxwell Anderson made Washington say better in the play about Valley Forge in 15 words : " This liberty will look easy by and by-when nobody dies to get it . " JOHN J. LIPSEY Colorado Springs , Colo . <P> The better it is said ( TIME , Dec. 10 , 1934 ) , the truer it is. - ED . <P> After a Famous Victory <P> Sirs : Mention of Robert Southey 's The Battle of Blenheim in your geograpnic Background of War brings to mind 141-year-old lines that are becoming all too current . Peterkin 's grandpa should have been nonplussed when he recalled <P> " With fire and sword the country round <P> Was wasted jar and wide , <P> And many a childing mother then , <P> And newborn baby died ; <P> But things like that , you know , must be <P> At every famous victory . <P> " They say it was a shocking sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand bodies here <P> Lay rotting in the sun ; <P> But things like that , you know , must be <P> After a famous victory . " <P> Should there be another Blenheim we , like grandpa , must conclude <P> " And every body praised the Duke <P> Who this great fight did win . <P> ' But what good came of it at last ? ' <P> Quoth little Peterkin . <P> ' Why , that I can not tell , ' said he ; <P> ' But ' t was a famous victory . ' " <P> RAY E. NELSON Gering , Neb . <P> Lid Over Panama <P> Sirs : Everyone is hearing a lot about building extra locks for the Panama Canal in case a lock was destroyed by air-attack from bombers TIME , Aug. 28 . Could not the extra lock be put out of operation just as easily as the present one , if not the same day , the next day ? Then , why not put a lid over the present locks and make them bombproof ? This could be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making the leaves as near bombproof as possible , and adding further protection by having ten or twelve-foot standards supporting heavy chain-net ten foot above the floor , similar chain-net as used by battleships as a protection from submarine torpedoes . When the leaves were put down , nothing would be in sight , all mechanism being underground . When vessels were sent through the Canal , the leaves could be raised in less than five minutes . Mechanical operation could be electrical with remote control . In fact , the leaves of the bascule-type bridge could be so camouflaged and with an imitation lock close by that I doubt very much whether the real lock could be located from the air . I suggested this to the Secretary of War , who referred it to the Chief of the Panama Canal Office , Washington , who said the " suggestion was interesting and would be brought to the attention of the proper officials for consideration .
