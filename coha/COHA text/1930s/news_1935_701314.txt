txt WASHINGTON , July 5 . ? Three important statistical projects , endorsed by the Census Bureau , will provide , if finally approved as part of the ' national re - employment drive , jobs for more than 150,000 persons for varying periods . The projects are , first , a census of population and unemployment , with an estimated cost of $16,000,000 ; second , a census of business activities , with an estimated cost of about $8,000,000 or $9,000,000 , and , third , an alphabetical index by geographic units and by families , of all individuals in the United States returned in the census of 1900 , to cost about $2,000,000 . The total estimated cost would thus be $26,000,000 or $27 , - 000,000 . Estimated employment for these three projects is 125,000 , 25,000 and 2,000 , respectively . The Department of Commerce , in behalf of the Census Bureau , has submitted requests to the Division of Applications and Information of the Works Program Administration for grants to cover the second and third projects . Check on Unemployment . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has received a favorable recommendation from a Cabinet committee appointed to consider the matter , made up of Secretaries Roper and Perkins and Administrator Harry Hopkins . Five different bills for an unemployment census are now pending before Congressional committees . None has received the approval of the Budget Bureau . The proposed census of population and employment depends , therefore , on a grant from the $4,000,000,000 works relief appropriation . The final decision now rests with President Roosevelt . The second project , that for a census of all business activities , except agriculture and manufacturing , will be started , if funds are granted , on Jan. 1 , 1936 , to cover the calender year 1935 . Under the plans prepared by the Department of Commerce , administrative head ' quarters will be located at Baltimore . The census will assemble I basic information on the number of operating units , employment , payrolls , receipts and other data for all business enterprises . Commerce Department officials believe that the data would be of great value in plans for business recovery and expansion and that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public policies relating to relief , public works , social security and the financial needs of business . Said the Department in its application : " A complete statistical picture of economic activities which together may broadly be designated as American business , has yet to be drawn . * * Substantial gaps in the picture still remain . Thus little is known concerning the gross amount of business , of the professions , of certain types of business such as truck and bus lines , of office buildings , of real estate operators and brokers and many others . " Census of the Aged . The third project , that for an alphabetical index , is to assemble information concerning the ages of individuals covered by recent State and Federal old-age pension legislation . Under the economic security law alone it is estimated that the Census Bureau will be asked to furnish evidence of age for at least 350,000 and perhaps as many as 500,000 applicants for old-age pensions during the first years of the operation of the law . For five or ten years thereafter the applications will probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of searches in the original census schedules would quickly destroy them . The Census Bureau plans to locate this indexing job at Philadelphia . For every individual the index would show the place of residence , the name of the individual residing in family , month and year of birth , age , birthplace and citizenship .
