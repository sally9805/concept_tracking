Scene of much happy bustling last week was the old brownstone mansion on sedate James Street that houses the Syracuse ( N. Y. ) Museum of Fine Arts . Cause : the assembling , judging and opening of the eighth annual National Ceramic Exhibition . For ceramists , the occasion was excuse for a jolly get-together , as well as a chance to see what other designers were up to . Lay folk could admire and be amused by the assorted exhibits . Sum of their reaction : bric-a-brac is coming back . <P> Common denominator of U. S. ceramists is whimsy . Sculpture at the show ranged from Viktor Schreckengost 's Shadrach , Meshach , Abednego , three haloed Negroes smiling down at the flames , to Sascha Brastoff 's boneless , bulbous , button-mouthed females , Emergence and Timid Maiden ( see cut ) , who look like a pair of praying mantises . Ceramist Brastoff 's figures , tastefully mounted on bases of grey velvet and satin , won a sculpture prize . Fit for the flossiest mantelpiece were such lively pieces as Annie Laurie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Prime mover of the National Ceramic Exhibition is tall , energetic , sparkling-eyed Anna Wetherill Olmsted , director of the Syracuse museum . She started the show in 1932 as a memorial to Syracuse 's ate gifted Adelaide Alsop Robineau , pioneer U. S. ceramist . On a shoestring budget Miss Olmsted has brought the show to national importance . Overjoyed was she in 1937 when a similar exhibition of U. S. ceramic art by European invitation toured Denmark , Sweden , Finland , and England , ceramic centres all , and won high praise . No mere praiser of museum pieces , Miss Olmsted is glad that many of he ceramists who enter the show are commercial designers , that the interest the show has inspired has spurred better design in mass production . Her aim : to remove from mantelpiece art the stigma of an inferiority complex .
