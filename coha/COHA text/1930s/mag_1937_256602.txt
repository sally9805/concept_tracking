Clamoring hideously , endlessly gibbering in the psychopathic wards of municipal hospitals , in the padded cells of county jails , victims of delirium tremens every day pursue their terrible hallucinations . Rats scramble over the bodies of their imagination . Snakes writhe around their necks . With tensely stretched fingers the maddened , sweating sots try to climb up the bending walls of curvetting rooms , after bats , buzzards , flitting elephants . Lizards scurry out of their roaring ears . And tales of forgotten sins flip off their white-furred , tremulous tongues . <P> Last week , to the 26 methods of treating D. T. 's developed by U. S. , English , French , German and Swiss specialists , the American Medical Association 's Journal added another cure , which the sponsors , Drs . Philip Edward Piker of Cincinnati and Jess Victor Cohn of Hollywood , Fla. offered as being simple and certain . Only 5.5% of their delirium tremens patients have died , whereas 10% to 12% is the average , 37% the high . <P> Drs . Piker &; Cohn never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hog-tie him only when they lack enough robust nurses to gentle the patient . <P> They calm the patient with paraldehyde . <P> They rarely give barbiturates ( like allonal ) because those drugs rarely quiet a drunk and do depress his circulation . They never give morphine , because that drug increases pressure on the brain and brings on death . They reduce intracranial pressure by draining fluid through a puncture in the spine . Most men who die in delirium tremens die because their hearts give way . Drs . Piker &; Cohn prevent that by loading the patient with digitalis . Digitalis , besides being a heart regulator , is a diuretic , something the raving drunkard requires . In delirium tremens the digestive system is out of whack . Drs . Piker &; Cohn wash out the patient 's stomach , purge him with cascara and Epsom salts , feed him well . And three times daily the doctors alkalize the patient with potus imperialis , a drink of oz. cream of tartar dissolved in 3 pints of water , sweetened and flavored with lemon peel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , medicinal or otherwise . " <P> Average time in the hospital for Piker &; Cohn D. T. patients is 4.8 days .
