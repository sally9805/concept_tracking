txt // is a part of Nature built up by it through an organism capable of it and illuminating that organism to itself and aiding the adjustment of internal relations to external relations ( a typical Spencerian verbiage ) ; and , to this end , the goddess of Reason is Imagination . We should use our imagination but consider our wisdom to lie rather in poetry than in prose . We should not take this Reason too seriously ; even our " animal faith " should not be taken without a grain of salt as a theory , for as such it may be but a myth ( although a good one ) . All said and done , every-day experience teaches us that reality is this world of mechanical necessity which produces out of its physical womb all that is ; mind is a product and not a cause of things , a plane where " the moving unities and tensions of animal life are synthesized on quite an-other plane of being , " but better understood the more we understand the life of matter in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to expect more from Nature than is con-sonant with its character ; we may desire an immortality of spirit and yearn for a better existence and set up our ideals , yea , even our gods , but such desires should be tempered by the sober thought that , though these longings have their setting in a Nature that has produced them , Nature itself holds out no promise other than what Nature itself is . Our hopes may be quite like the little waves upon the great sea which passes through them and moves on ; it might be a part of wisdom to realize them as little waves and enjoy them while they last . Such , in barest outline , is the tone of this naturalistic " metaphysics . " Other examples of Naturalism as a modern form of mate-rialism could be given . We must , however , in this introduc-tory survey be content to have given three characteristic ex-pressions . We turn to a brief consideration of two other concrete expressions of modern materialism , viz. , certain va-rieties of New Realism and Metaphysical Behaviorism.l2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Reactionary Movement Against Idealism To appreciate fully the way in which some New Realists arrive at their materialistic outlook requires us to go back for a running start to the beginnings of this movement in general . New Realism had its birth at the opening of the twentieth century among a group of British and American philosophers . We may well say that it was a movement of reaction against the amazing influence and sway of idealism , which for so long had been considered the only respectable kind of philosophy . The chief " sore spot " for the New Realists in the idealistic metaphysics was its insistence upon reducing everything to mental terms , of making the " without " conform to the " within . " In opposition to this , these reactionaries were bent on making the " without " respectable without the " within " ; and , in so doing , the tendency was to go to the opposite extreme of making the " within " conform to the " without . " There is a world " out there " which is independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it that the mind is what it is because the " out there " is what it is . In other words mind is part and parcel of a general " out there . " Real Reality is pan-objective ( rav , the Greek word for " all " ) and includes within it the so-called " within . " Mind , therefore , is not something sui generis apart from the great objective world ; it is a part of that world . It was but a step , then , to say that mind is that peculiar condition or process whereby the world gets expressed ; it is that part of general objectivity which becomes objective-subject without becoming something essentially different from itself . Mind is thus a part of the general stream of Nature , a part of the grand naturalistic // process . ( Here , we see of course , is a species of Natural-ism . ) The Frontal Attack of the New Realists Now , the frontal attack of the New Realists in general has been to dethrone the unique character and status of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Asking the idealists to say what they mean by mind , the realists have been answered that it is a peculiar kind of irreducible substance or entity ( in some cases , process ) , i.e. , reducible to no other terms than those of its own character . Such a statement ( so runs the charge ) is as philosophically indefensible ( dogmatic ? ) as it is irrefutable . If the mind be sui generis in character , indescribable in terms other than itself ( and , even then , not fully ) , and it is to be distin-guished from the world " out there , " nothing further can he said : the critic is disarmed . But , it is asked , is the mind a unique substance , entity , or process looking out at the world from its self-inclosed sphere of being ? James 's Contribution to the New Realistic Movement William James in a famous paper ( published in 1904 ) entitled " Does Consciousness Exist ? " was asking this same question and came to the startling conclusion that instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or elemental substance , a thing or " soul , " " it " is but an abstract term covering a series of relations.13 Mind is not a kind of a tenuous basket containing rarefied qualities set apart and aloof from an objective world ; rather , " it " is only a context of diverse experiences in that world , some of which are grouped in such a way as to form that context which may be // called by the term " mental " and some grouped in another way to form what is called the " physical . " This view , which has its setting in what James calls " radi-cal empiricism , " may seem puzzling to those who have con-sidered their " selves " in the old substantial way . If one , however , tries to think of mind as a relation ( or series of relations ) merely , one will get the feel of this doctrine . With " mind " thus evaporated , it should be easy to see how the idealistic and dualistic metaphysics begin to totter ; for has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of a unique spiritual or mental entity ( or process ) and has not ontological dualism insisted upon two irreducible entities ( or processes ) , mind vs. matter , each sui generis , as making up the world of circumstance ? What then ? Here we leave James as he turns to another road fol-lowing out what he regarded as the most favorable implica-tions and interpretations of his demolished " conscious-ness. " 14 Here we find the New Realists already upon the scene gladly heralding the demise of **26;578;TOOLONG in their loud cries against the idealistic orthodoxy . A new set of phil-osophical schools was born out of this reaction , agreeing in general upon certain platforms but disagreeing violently on the definite " planks " which should go into the building of those platforms . Among these new schools , the so-called American New Realists ( though not all ) came closer to set-ting up a new and modified form of materialism . English vs . American New Realists : Doctrines of Mind Keeping in mind that it is the " without " that is being emphasized among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimized , certain questions are raised : what is the // " without " like , its character and nature , and what is the " within " like , its place in the scheme of things ? Here we find disagreements in the New Realistic camps . Two , schools , English New Realists and American New Realists , stand out , the former on the whole less radical than the latter . When we say " less radical , " we mean in their views of consciousness . For the English New Realists , on the whole , consciousness is conceived to be a pure transparent activity ( not a psychic stuff ) , a kind of state of diaphaneity ( &a4atv(.0; to shine through ) , a relation of awareness , mental , if you will , through which the objective world is directly disclosed . Consider an illustration . Suppose we think of a windowpane ( as a part of the external world ) not as a substance but as a function , a " window-paning . " From this point of view its nature is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an environment of its own stuff or character ; rather , " it " is what " it " is in terms of the functioning process , window-paning , i.e. , revealing the objective sunlight . Now consciousness , similarly , is that peculiar act of awareness or consciousing which , like the window-paning , discloses directly the objective world . " It " is not a something which is apart from the environment and which shapes that environment to its own character ; rather , " it " is what " it " is in terms of an external world functioning mentally and through which functioning that world is directly revealed , disclosed ( related ) in a unique way . Consciousness is consciousing ; and consciousing is a peculiar relating process which goes on in that world . For the American New Realists , on the whole , consciousness similarly is conceived to be a relation ( not a psychic stuff ) between objects in an objective world ; but it is a mere relation , one which is conditioned by a neural organism ( the body ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar external relations which go to make up the NEW REALISM AND REALITY pan-objective reality . Take the same illustration and carry it further . For the latter school , on the whole , consciousness is not only not a window-pane nor a " window-paning , " " it " is merely the relation between sunlight in one place and sunlight in another ; " it " is not only not a consciousness nor a consciousing , " it " is merely one of many external rela-tions in the environment . Shades of shades ! " It " has dis-appeared into a shadow of mere relation without form or content . Not even a ghost of it is left . Even the smile of the disappeared Cheshire Cat has faded out . All we have is a world of objects and relations , all objective to the nth degree in a pan-objectivism gone mad ! 15 New Realism and Reality But we have not yet ferreted out the materialism among the New Realists toward which our search has been all along directed . There remains only to consider how the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of them speaking of that world in terms of the physical and these " relations " interpreted in physical categories , we have made the capture . For , as we have traced the story through , among the American New Realists , especially , the " psychi-cal " has disappeared and no longer stands in the way . In regard to this external world with its external rela-tions there have been given two general interpretations by the extreme pan-objectivists . The one , influenced largely by Edwin B. Holt and Bertrand Russell , regards the world as // neutral in character , hence neutralism . This view regards the nature of the world of circumstance as ultimately reducible to categories which lie beyond the physical and psychical . We reserve discussion of this group to the proper heading which comes later in the discussion . ' The other group in-terprets the world essentially in terms of the physical categories , and here we find materialism in modern dress . A few samples are now in order . The Materialistic Tendencies in the New Realism of Woodbridge One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. E. Woodbridge of Columbia University . In a number of important philosophical papers , among which " The Na-ture of Consciousness " is conspicuous , ' Professor Wood-bridge asserts a thoroughgoing pan-objectivism which when interpreted seems to plunge headlong into a materialistic view . It may well be that this philosopher would repudiate such a classification , since his views ( like so many others ) seem hard to capture in a single type of trap . Nevertheless , if his views are not to be considered a clean-cut case of mate-rialism , he is so dangerously close to it that we shall consider him at least a quasi-materialist . For Woodbridge the world of reality consists of objects in time and space in and among which activities and events occur . What has been called " mind " is only a term ( an unhappy one because it is so misleading ) for thinking-activ-ity ; thinking-activity is but one among many of the relat-ings going on in the space-time world . Thinking is one of the behavior-activities of the neural organism like eating , walking , breathing , etc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , though such activity is not necessarily con-fined to the space- and time-limitations of that body . Even // as " we may walk with our legs , we do not walk in them , " so , " although we may think with our brains , we do not think in them " ( his own illustration ) . Who are " we " ? Not pe-culiar agents which think but that realm of being in which thinking occurs ! There is this difference between bodily activity and mental activity ; whereas the one is confined to certain limits within the space-time world , the other roams about here and everywhere within that world . The differ-ence , then , is one of relation ; objects become related with other objects in a variety of ways , some of which are lim-ited in time and place , physical activity , and some of which get stretched out in time and place . This latter activity is mental activity . Try , if you will , to conceive of the abstract noun " mind " apart from activity . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For Woodbridge the fundamental and basic term is Nature , in which we live and move and have our being . It is this Nature of matter , atoms , space and time , ions , electrical charges , stable bodies and rhythmic motions , living organisms with thinking activities , etc. , that is reality , a plurality of things and relations produced in space and time within it , and bound together and enmeshed in a struc-tural order . Let the reader classify ( if he can ! ) this last sen-tence ( which is a mosaic taken from a recent testimony of this philosopher ) 19 together with the view of consciousness given above . One may not be willing to say , if one be ex-ceedingly cautious , that this American New Realist has al-ready become wet in the waters of materialism but , assuredly , he has left the diving board and is dangerously approaching the deep sea . New Realism and Montague 's " Animistic Materialism " Since we have already sketched the views of Professor // Montague , 20 we need here only pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American New Realists.21 Although he later confesses his strong disagree-ment with some of the assertions of his colleagues , never-theless he sticks to his materialistic convictions . Pan-objec-tivism with him is the ideal philosophic view ; to reach it he reinterprets consciousness in terms of negative or potential energy ( or , to he more specific , " the potentiality of the physical is the actuality of the psychical " ) , 22 by which re-interpretation he expressly means not to deny or wipe out ( as some New Realists seem to have done ) consciousness altogether but to give it its proper place in the general scheme of things . That general scheme of things is ( as will be recalled ) the world of " animistic materialism . " New Realism and the Metaphysics of S. Alexander New Realism has , perhaps , gained its most systematic expression in the magnum opus entitled Space , Time and Deity , the celebrated Gifford Lectures ( 1916 ? 18 ) of S. Alexander.23 Here , again , the question of classification is difficult . Yet , the suspicion of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leans heavily throughout upon the employment of fundamental categories usually associated with the physical world . His general metaphysics may be stated somewhat as follows : There is one reality , Space-Time or Motion , the Stuff out of which everything that is becomes . This fundamental stuff breaks up of itself into complexes of existents , rising higher and higher in a scale of levels to mind , which is but a specific configuration or complication of the original Space-Time , a collocation of motions belonging to the highest level of existence . In other words , out of the original motion of // Space-Time there develop new complexities of motions producing new qualities ; mind is thus a new quality which has emerged from the organic processes , life , having qualities distinct from and not wholly reducible to levels lower than itself and thus behaving in a way peculiar to itself . Nevertheless , the womb that has produced all these levels is the original Space-Time Stuff . The principle of emergence , this motion toward higher levels which we have reason to believe may reach out farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . What is " mind " more specifically to this systematic thinker ? " It " is not a something outside of the general scheme of things ; rather , " it " is the neural organism blossoming forth in a new set of qualities or dimensions ; " it " is the sum-total of awareness-activity existing in the Space-Time world . Another novel feature of this metaphysics ( alas ! too novel , perhaps , either for exposition or comprehension ) is the view that Space may be considered the " body " which is saturated with " Time " which , in turn , may be considered Space 's " mind . " How shall such a view be classified ? That is the question ! So much hinges on what is meant by the Stuff " Space-Time " and this notion of Motion . " Mind " is not coeval with the original stuff ; it has its setting in something prior to and more fundamental than " itself . " What is this original stuff out of which everything emerges ? Of one thing we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objective , existing in its own right and depending on nothing but itself . To borrow a thought from Aristotle , It is the Unmoved Mover . Perhaps this stuff is to be thought of as a pure abstraction , beyond the categories of the physical and mental . If so , the view may be classed as neutralism . Our reasons for classifying it here at least as a quasi-materialism are two . First , Alexander seems to be trying to set up a metaphysical system on the basis of a natural or naive realism ; that is , the kind of world as it appears to be before one becomes sophisticated // about it . To make this kind of world philosophically respectable he wards off the claim of the Idealists , in the typical New Realistic way , by making the " mind " compatible with a pan-objectivism . And , secondly , he draws his fundamental categories from those usually associated with the kind of world that natural realism holds , viz. , a world physical in character , existing in an objective space and having an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phenomenon called " mind " ( though this last is not the natural realistic view ) . Whether or not he has succeeded in making such a world philosophically respectable is for the reader to judge ; but surely it is a glorious attempt to take naive experience of a physical world at face-value and to make the most out of it in terms of metaphysical speculation . Like Woodbridge , he may not be wet with materialism although circumstantial evidence seems to show that he is plunging in that direction . Materialism and Metaphysical Behaviorism Factors in the Movement Toward Metaphysical Behaviorism It is but a step from New Realism , especially the American variety , to Metaphysical Behaviorism . The one is a good introduction to the other . Both are pan-objective . James 's view of consciousness helped to pave the way ; Woodbridge 's extreme New Realism is said by Professor Montague to be the first acute case of behaviorism on the scene . Once begun , the behavioristic movement developed to tremendous proportions in psychological and metaphysical circles of America . But there are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its notion of soul , which had already been regarded as leading nowhere except from confusion to confusion . There was the rapid development of the natural sciences and empirical observation with its laboratory technique . There was the growing // emphasis upon positivism , naturalism , empiricism , realism ? all anti-idealistic currents . Then there was the publication in 1903 of Studies in Logical Theory , the first manifesto of the so-called instru-mentalists , 25 of whom John Dewey , America 's widely known philosopher , educational and social leader , was the chief prophet ; and , back of these studies , other essays by the same author , who had early seen in James 's famous Principles of Psychology ( 1890 ) some things which others had seemed to fail to see ( including , perhaps , James himself ) . The manifesto of the instrumentalists had declared that logical principles are related to processes of thought and that these in turn are to be interpreted in terms not of " states of consciousness " but as instruments of adjustment to life-situa-tions . The germ of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their state of rigidity and nonchalant complacency as quiet spectators of the scene of life and give to them their " rightful " place as " platforms of response , " " tools " of adaptation , " instruments " of reconstruction ( as the slogans later fell ) , was acknowledged to have been found by this prophet in that influential work of James . Then , too , there was that earlier address of Dewey 's entitled " Psychology and Philosophic Method , " delivered in Cali-fornia in 1899 , wherein was banished the assumption of a substantialized " soul " or " ego " from psychological pro-cedure and where " states of consciousness " were to be inter-preted in terms of the flow of behavior-experience in a set-ting of the full sweep of existence , and wherein occurs the subtle suggestion that even as psychological method and out-look would have to be revised , so would philosophy itself.2S This leads to other factors in the movement toward Meta232 RECENT MATERIALISM physical Behaviorism : the wide influence of such functional psychologists as J. R. Angell ( now president of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , who , following the lead of James , had come to speak of mental functioning instead of mental states and , who came to emphasize the study of objective behavior as the chief psychological method ; the influence of the genetic point of view , which came in the wake of the evolutionary theories and has been so fruitful of application in the biological sciences ; the vigorous development of physiological psychology and especially animal psychology , which came to be studied in terms of the magical formula of " Stimulus ? Response " ( the so-called S-R bond ) ; the pragmatic realism , which applies the functional view to questions of philosophical interest by describing , measuring , and evaluating things in terms of what they do , how they work and behave . The stream of pan-objective influences kept coming in from all directions until it was inevitable that there would be an overflow of a variety of expressive currents . Metaphysical Behaviorism was but one inevitable expression in that great flood of pan-objectivism . Definitions of Behaviorism We have not defined what is meant by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what , in general , it is all about . In pursuance of clarity two sets of distinctions ought to be made in discussing the term , which has suffered from a certain ambiguity in current literature . In the first place , a distinction should be made between methodological behaviorism and metaphysical behaviorism , the one having to do with a method in psychology , and the other with a distinct set of implications for metaphysics which arise out of that method in its extreme form , specifically in its doctrine of mind . In the second place , a distinction should be made ( which is , unhappily , not made by all expositors ) within methodological behaviorism between its mild and its 1 // extreme forms . In its mild form behaviorism as a method undertakes to press the objective approach to the study of mental life to the limit of its workability ( which , as an ideal , is an ever-receding line ) without annihilating but supplementing and correcting the so-called introspective method ( i.e. , where the individual is asked to " look within " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within ) . In its extreme form behaviorism as a method ignores the introspective method altogether and treats the whole matter in terms of Stimulus and Response ( the so-called S-R bond ) . For the latter method , if we set up X as mind , the X-as-such is ignored , and psychology becomes a mere matter of S-R bond . Extreme Methodological Behaviorism A word first about the extreme form is perhaps our best method of exposition . Under the influence of this whole movement of pan-objectivism and particularly the ideals of the natural sciences ( especially biology ) together with the fine results of physiological psychology and the study of animal behavior it came to be increasingly clear to those who wished to make psychology scientifically respectable that the time was ripe for recasting the whole procedure . The introspective method could never hope to claim-a scientific status , so the claim runs ; testimonies of what goes on within not only are at variance with one another ; but , what is more , they can never be brought out to the light of objective scrutiny ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) as another ; for no one is verifiable according to the ideals of an objective science . Now , the ideal of an empirical scientific procedure is to work upon the object of inquiry under conditions of control , handle it in Baconian fashion , set a definite task and note the objective results , and allow others to make their observations and verify the conclusions noted so that prediction is made possible ? behavior-under-control , // such is the behavioristic and experimental method . This is the highway to scientific understanding ; results obtained by such a method assure psychology of a respectable place among the natural sciences and will surely remove the odium of speculation which it so long had as it sat in the lap of philosophy . The psychology of the past has been a set of philosophical and theological prejudices ; it has had notions which have been accepted by the momentum of opinion , a batch of irresponsible guesses and dogmatic theories . The rigid application of the S-R bond is thus the magic key that will open up the new vista of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular notion of memory . All sorts of ideas have been entertained in regard to the " faculty " of remembering ( as well as forgetting ) . How shall we really " get next " to this important phase of mental life ? We have trusted introspection , only to find out that that method leads finally to error . Why not subject this whole question to experimental methods ? apply the S-R bond ? This has been tried and not only with success but with surprising results . The famous nonsense syllables of Ebbinghaus , the German psychologist , have formed one of the methods employed to gain this information . ( Syllables of a vowel attached to two consonants have been made with the definite purpose of eliminating such as carry word-meanings and have thus been presented for memorizing , with time and other factors under control , and the results of memory noted . ) Verbatim ( rote ) as over against meaning-types of memorizing have been singled out in specific types of experiments set up for such purposes . The responses are carefully noted , repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empirical " laws " of mental behavior ; the whole is in terms of S-R . It has been found that economy of effort in memorizing is attained , on the whole , by taking the subject-matter as a whole through repetition rather than piece by piece ; that one forgets immediately following the learnMILD // ing sooner than at any later period ; that permanency of retained material is to be gained by short interval-periods of learning rather than by uninterrupted application ; and so on . ( We might pause for breath here to suggest the implied moral of these results to students who must from time to time face academic tribunals . Space , happily , forbids . ) Note well that these simple observational experiments have been performed wholly in an objective way and under specific control , and no questions of an introspective character have been asked the subject . It is performance of a task , reactions to stimuli , responses , expressions , that have been sought out and measured . Surely this is as objective as anything can be . The test here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of animal psychology where introspection is patently not applicable , the difference being only that in the latter cases overt-actions ( such as motor responses , glandular and other physiological reactions ) form the chief types of response . The small school of radical behaviorists usually like to confine their treatment to those overt-responses that can be more accurately measured and predicted and hence take their cue from animal psychology ; nevertheless , as a methodology we link them together here by virtue of their refusal to use the method of introspection . Mild Methodological Behaviorism Take , now , a case of a milder form of behavioristic method where introspection is employed but carefully checked . It was long believed that we have an almost innumerable variety of tastes . Introspection seemed to confirm this popular notion . Do we not have a peculiar taste corresponding to warm mashed-potatoes and another for cold potatoes , one for frozen and another for warm and liquid sherbets , one for Philadelphia cream-cheese and another for Limburger , and so on ad libitum ? Most people think so ; the mind seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . guy // But experimental psychology brought to the aid of intro-spection has proved otherwise . The popular mind has been confusing taste with temperature , with smell , and with the sensation of contact . Eliminate the different temperature , smell , and contact factors ( by reducing the foods to the same temperature and to the same liquid state and by either " having a cold " or stuffing the nostrils ) and what have you ? The food does not " taste " the same ! The differences were due to other sensory activities which we had thought were taste-sensations . Instead of a tremendous variety of tastes there are thus found to be only four elementary forms : sweet , bitter , sour , and salt . How do we know this ? By ap-plying carefully selected stimuli and noting the responses ( either negative or positive ) as checks to introspection.27 An Evaluation of Methodological Behaviorism So far we have been noting the methodological types of behaviorism . This method , in general , has proved so suc-cessful that hardly anyone doubts its value . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious quarrel . As J. R. Angell ( who belongs , together with E. L. Thorndike , to the milder group ) has remarked , it is one of the most promising methods devised so far in the study of mental life . Whether or not it can be prosecuted all the way , to cover all the intricacies and complexities of mind , may be open to some serious questions . Nevertheless , since the empirical sciences are in this regard optimistic ( and like other natural sciences necessarily so ) , it remains as an ideal to those who insist upon making psychology respectable among those sciences . One fact is clear . Mental processes have already yielded beautifully and with important results to this general approach , which has revolutionized in a single // generation the whole face of the subject . The chief quarrel lies with the extreme form , more particularly with the radicals among the extremists . While admitting the difficulties of arriving at scientifically respectable conclusions by way of introspection , there is this to say , that only by way of introspection can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of objectivity can furnish . We are ready now to move on to Metaphysical Behaviorism . Metaphysical Implications of Extreme Methodological Behaviorism For the methodological extremists , we have said , X-assuch is ignored ; the subject matter for a science of psychology consists wholly and only of S-R . Now one of two implications follows from this extreme method . Either a psychologist may say that X-as-such may conceivably exist off by itself but that scientifically we can say nothing about " it , " or he may say that X equals S-R . This distinction may , at first , seem of no consequence . But let us make it clear that this is of serious moment to metaphysics , even at the cost of repetition , by setting up the following distinctions . Extreme methodological behaviorism constructs its psychology , as we have said , by ignoring X-as-such and interesting itself in S-R . Now , to some this does not mean that there may not be a metaphysical X-as-such ; it means only that we can know nothing of scientific value about " it-as-such " ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior ) . In other words , we may grant ( metaphysically , if we will ) an X-as-such ; but a scientific method forbids our having anything to do with " it-as-such . " ( Unguardedly it might be said that X-as-such gets expressed in terms of S-R ; but this is a paradox , since , by definition we do not know the X-assuch ) . The implication here for a philosophy of reality , so far as " mind-as-such " is concerned , is that of agnosticism . As for me and my house , so would these men say , we do n't // know anything about such metaphysical questions ; we are hard-boiled scientists , content to remain , like the positivists , within the smaller area of the scientifically knowable . For others , the radicals among the extremists , other implications are drawn and these play right into the hands of metaphysics . These latter psychologists would say that not only do we not know anything about X-as-such but there is no metaphysical X-as-such at all ; the mind is behavior and there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implications , drawn from methodology , leads to an agnostic metaphysics , the other leads to a definite metaphysics . With " mind " thus reduced wholly to behavior and with a metaphysical theory thereupon built ( or , at least , inferred ) it follows either that behavior ( which is generally conceived to be in terms of a physical organism ) is interpreted in terms of an underlying reality which is in itself ultimately not physical , or that it is bluntly interpreted as physical and nothing more . In the first instance we have a metaphysical theory that is neutralistic and in the second instance we have one that is materialistic.28 Here , then , among this second group of radical metaphysical behaviorists we have our long-sought metaphysical behaviorism which is materialistic . Materialism and Metaphysical Behaviorism No one , perhaps , stands out so conspicuously as a prophet of this extreme methodology turned to a materialistic meta-physics than Doctor John B. Watson . His Psychology from the Standpoint of a Behaviorist ( published by Lippincott in 1919 ) , representing his later views , may be regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of materialism . In a bold preface to his book he announces that he has dropped the word " consciousness " as well as other typi-cally psychological terms ( like sensation , perception , attenMETAPHYSICAL // tion , will , etc. ) , since psychology can get along very well without them and , furthermore , for the reason that he ( and he thinks others ) does not know what they mean . He chooses to retain the word " thinking " but redefines it along-side other responses ( habit and hereditary ) as subvocal talk-ing ! Doctor Watson came to his method trained in the rigorous discipline of the experimental laboratory and by special studies in animal psychology . Convinced that the methods used there were the only truly scientific ones , he set to work in " dressing up " human psychology in terms of the same categories ; for him the magic key is the S-R bond and the dubious and evasive categories used by traditional psychol-ogy are redefined ( or dropped ) in terms of physiological ( hence physical ) categories . It is the organism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when asked by critics ( who dubbed his views " muscle-twitch psychology " and other pet names ) what the difference is between this kind of psychology and physiology , he replies that the two are intimately associated and differ only in scope of treat-ment : physiology studies the functioning organism in pieces while psychology studies that same organism as it functions as a whole , in total situations , thus carrying physiological studies a further step . Psychology is concerned with certain total situations in the daily life of individuals which deter-mine their behavior , which physiology as such does not treat . Psychology and physiology thus belong to departments of biology . Thus mind , " consciousness " or whatever corre-sponding term you will , is reduced to physiological behavior , muscular , glandular , and nerve-processes . " Thought , " says Watson in his materialistic psychological manifesto , " is not different in essence from tennis-playing , swimming , or any other overt-activity except that it is hidden from ordinary observation and is more complex . " 23 As such , there is noth240 RECENT MATERIALISM ing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not merely concerned with methodology ; they constitute a metaphysical statement . They bear down directly upon a view of reality . The implication plainly is that whatever is can be reduced to categories of the physical world . If mind can thus be reduced , pray tell , what else stands in the way ? 3 ? Here we have a stark , pan-objectivistic materialism . Watson , of course , is not alone in these claims . Among those who stand close to him in this swing to materialistic Metaphysical Behaviorism we may mention : Professors E. B. Frost ( certain published statements , perhaps , of R. B. Perry ) , K. S. Lashley , and A. P. Weiss ? the latter , not be-ing satisfied with mere physiological categories , has called in those from physics and constructed a picture of mental processes in terms of the product of an electronic flux among the electrons which go to make up the nervous system which in turn has its setting in a world of cosmic motion ! CHAPTER XI DYNAMISM ACCORDING to the classification which we have set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpretation of reality , i.e. , the view which holds that the character of Being when trimmed down to its ultimate " constitution " consists of a non-mental and non-material character , pulsating with energy , power , force . ' Now it may be plainly admitted ? , that this business of classification is somewhat arbitrary , especially in the case of those views which as " border-line " cases admit of more than one classification . Some writers , for example , prefer to classify an energistic view with materialism , since the category of energy seems to belong to the physical world . This we hold to be satisfactory , provided the particular metaphysical view leans strongly in the direction of the physical . This , as we have seen , is well illustrated in the view of Montague . ' However , the concept of energy need not be necessarily physical ; it may be considered as well a mental category ; for are there not stresses and strains in the inner psychical experiences as well ? If these latter were stressed , then we should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , e.g. , Leibniz 's monadology and the panpsychists ' views in general.3 Or , we may have a dynamic view of matter in which the " stuff " of reality is thought of not necessarily in terms of energy but in terms of an un- or ill-defined power such as characterized the hylozoists4 and the later materialists , who lean on physical categories . We have seen that " force " was for a long time considered // in a vague way in terms of motion . It was thus conceived to be not so much a something as a peculiar and ultimate kind of behavior associated with things . This , on the whole , was the view of the old materialism . " Then , " force " was consid-ered as a kind of quality inhering in things ( with emphasis upon things ) ; s or it was conceived to be a kind of tenuous entity or substance and thus associated with other substances in a characteristically physical world. ? Force conceived of as a " pure " dynamic process , the ultimate to which everything can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Recent Developments of Thought Favorable to a Possible Dynamism Certain recent developments of thought when taken to-gether seem to furnish the basis for a dynamistic interpreta-tion of reality . Let us construct a clean-cut case and offer it as an example of the possibility of such a view attaining a respectable place among the various metaphysical theories . We shall take our cue , on the one hand , from certain trends in recent physics and , on the other , from certain extreme trends among the pan-objectivists8 who have come to certain conclusions about how the " mind " is to be treated . A synthesis of these two trends leads directly to this type of meta-physical theory . It has now become well known that revolutions have been going on for a considerable time in the field of the physical sciences concerning the nature of matter and substance as well as the world of space and time . In fact , that whole sub-ject is in a whirl . In the quest for the ultimate " constitution " // of what goes to make up the physical world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first of all found to be reducible to molecules , then to atoms , these in turn to protons and electrons , then still further into sources of radiation or into wave-groupings and , finally , into events which issue from some center of activity . To the older scientists and philosophers matter was looked upon as a something which has extension in space and which endured , though passing through transformations , through time . But all this has now been changed . Substances seem to have melted into processes ; although these processes ( as in the case of the quantum theory of light formulated by Max Planck of Berlin ) are thought to behave discontinuously , i.e. , after the manner of shots or bundles , nevertheless they are fundamentally processes . Under the pressure of the recent doctrines of relativity another blow was given old notions . The old Space World of three dimensions ( up-down , right-left , forward-backward ) , extending infinitely in all directions , considered to exist together with an independent Time , without beginning or ending , in a state of absolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the fourth being Time or the relation of before-after ) and relative . According to the mathematical prophet , Einstein , who finds his prophecies becoming , on the whole , fulfilled by the findings of the most recent experimental physics , such quantities as length , mass and time , instead of remaining constant , turn out to be functions of the velocity of movement varying with that velocity according to the point of view of the observer or to the special frame of reference . Thus the situation in which matter is supposed to appear is itself unstable ; the world itself becomes for us not a something that " stays put " but a series of " situations " in which a series of events related to other series of events appears from certain points of reference ! The thought of this makes one dizzy ! This is , of course , the pic- // ture of reality in the large and not that which appears to ordinary experience . For everyday observation the differ-ences and relativities do not appear because they are so slight ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective ( consider here stellar " spaces " and " light years " ) these are of fundamental importance . Well , the point here is ( ! ) that there is for us fundamentally no one stable cosmic reality which exists in a state of nonchalant complacency but , rather , a series of cosmic events , processes , happenings , criss-crossings , according to the " point " of reference and in which series of events as ultimates occurs the phenomenon which is called " matter . " Is all this clear ? If not , try to conceive of a series of criss-crossing processes , dynamic " to the core " without any " con-tainer " holding these together and you will have , on the whole , the picture of " reality " as suggested by a relativistic mathematico-physics.9 It is difficult for the human mind to picture a scene as mere fundamental processes ( this may be of some comfort to the reader as well as the writer ) . All we are interested in here is to show how ultimates are being reduced not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of physics may well point in the direction of a dynamistic metaSOME // physics , since these processes-as-ultimates ( call them events ) are not necessarily physical in themselves even though physics has been the particular science that has pointed to them . They may in themselves as well be neutral in character though issuing in ways that are called " physical . " There remains , however , the question of " mind . " If " mind " be conceived in terms of what the extreme pan-ob-jectivists have offered as an external , relational activity be-tween objects in an objective world or as the behavior of the organism responding in a kind of total way to its environ-ment , 10 and if this objective world , organism , and environ-ment which are conceived to be physical turn out ultimately to be mere processes ? such a synthesis makes the dynamistic interpretation complete ! We have here everything reducible fundamentally to processes , ultimately neither physical nor mental.11 Some Earlier Approaches to a Dynamistic Theory of Reality Examples of such a pure form of dynamistic theory as we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but approaches to it are not wanting . The notion of funda-mental process as the basic character of reality dates back to almost the very beginnings of Greek philosophy , though it was associated with quasi-materialistic categories . Heracleitus ( fl. c. 500 B.C. ) had the notion of an ever-ceaseless whirling which got expressed in his metaphysics in the famous sentences : " Everything flows " ( lydvTa pea ) and // " You can not step twice into the same river " which he sym-bolized in terms of ethereal fire or fire-soul . This eternal flux , however , behaved in a rhythmic and orderly fashion ! Jumping the centuries and coming down to modern time we note , in passing , the name of Herbert Spencer , whom we have already considered , " as applying the notion of Force as the fundamental principle of reality though we can not know what it is ; since on the basis of his agnosticism reality is Unknowable ! His synthetic philosophy of cosmic move-ment has in it strong possibilities of a dynamistic point of view though the agnosticism which underlies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him a tendency to magnify physical nature . The concept of energy was employed to the very limit by Wilhelm Ostwald ( 1853 ? 1932 ) as the fundamental character of the subject-matter of physics and chemistry , of life , mind , and the whole world of Nature . Physical energy and psychi-cal energy , according to him , are mutually interchangeable , each reducible to the other in a system that is known as Energism . This sounds like dynamism and would furnish a good illustration were it not for the fact that Ostwald 's sys-tem is mixed , in an apparent inconsistency , with a bias to-wards phenomenalism13 and with a leaning toward material-ism . We remind ourselves that at this period of thought the new dynamic materialism14 was being heralded abroad , and though Ostwald is to be thought of perhaps as one of those new materialists , nevertheless his metaphysical system con-tains approaches to the view which we are here considering . The Metaphysical Energism of Boodin Apparently one of the best recent statements of a view that approaches a dynamistic metaphysics is the confession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of California ( at Los Angeles ) , though it is not a case , perhaps , of a pure type . We adopt his classification ; he calls his position " metaphysical energism " 1 ' although he has built up an interpretation out of it of a cosmic idealism ! Let us take a look at this position . The ultimate character of existence ( being ) , says Boodin , is not a neutral " stuff " but a series of activity systems in action and reaction with one another . This he claims , of course , is the doctrine of modern science . " Now , just what is the character of these systems ? Well , the answer is that the mental system of activity ( mind ) which is a part of the total natural process ( and at a " higher " level ) , in the first place , can answer this question because it is not a something apart from the total system of activity but in the very fiber of it ; but , in the second place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part . It can say something but not everything . Mental activity can do two things : it can " conceptualize " its world , thus describe and predict the behavior of things , and it can enter into an immediate relationship with things which immediacy can not be fully conceptualized but only appre-ciated and practically realized . Now , in conceptualizing things we are finding that the concepts " energy , " " time , " and " space " are , in some sense , essential aspects of activity systems . But , these concepts , as the relativity doctrine has shown , are variable , i.e. , they must not be taken apart ( i.e. , abstracted ) from the system of reference to which they belong and must not be treated as absolute ; moreover , they must be considered only as useful postulates of the world as seen through the level of conceptual thinking and useful because workable in describing and pre- // dicting the behavior of natural processes.17 That is all that the natural sciences can claim for them . There is more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , i.e. , more than merely through concepts ; there is an immediate rapport with reality which comes in two ways . In the first place , mental activity is structurally constituted ( i.e. , there is something about it that it acts in an organized manner and not in piece-meal or falling-apart way ) ; without this struc-tural character there would be no knowledge ( no thought nor science ) ; and , what is more , if the world of nature itself had no structural character there could be no knowledge . Now , there is thus a structural system answering back to the structural character of mental activity and , conversely , a structural mental activity answering back to a structural system . The evolutionary doctrines have been showing that mental life is a product of Nature and , as such , mental life is a part of Nature , disclosing its character ; or , to put it here more concretely , the structural activity of mind discloses the structural character of Nature . This is one of the inner ap-preciations and realizations of mental life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the way down and up the scale , are sensitive to each other , which makes for action and re-action in a communal way . This sensitivity which is universal ( here Boodin , as the reader will see , speaks as would a pan-psychist ! ) is part and parcel of the mental system and gives to that system its immediate touch with that " zone of ac-tivity " with which it is connected . Sensitivity means here " awareness . " To sum up , then , activity systems have for mental systems five attributes : energy , space , and time which are conceptual and useful constructions and variable , and structure and awareness which are immediately appreciated and universally constant . Such is the world of reality as it " appears " ( and // we have legitimate reason to believe " is " ) for human beings . But it is undoubtedly more than this since what we say of it is in terms of " our " level . To jelly-fish or to angels the picture would be in terms of their level ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " inside " Nature at a given level . How , then , shall we judge the total scene ? The mistake of so many interpreters is to judge it only and wholly in terms of what may appear at only one level . The whole is made to fit the part . We should be on our guard here and remember our proper place . The total systems of activity are greater than we . We know only in part . But that part is significant and gives us clues ( if only clues ) as to the whole . Now one of the distinctive features of the human level is the striving for truth , morality , and beauty ; these ideals are themselves a part of Nature which has produced them at this level ; they belong to a system of activity which in the course of evolution stands high . From this vantage point of view ( i.e. , the human ) natural processes take on a certain glow ; the whole , as we view it especially from our intuitions , appreciations , and insights takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction and realization of value which in turn is Nature 's own way of giving meaning to itself . Thus , in the picture of Boodin , we have a philosophy that is thoroughly naturalistic ; in its construction he draws freely from New Realism , panpsychism , quantitative pluralism , evolutionism , dynamism , pragmatism , and the doctrines of recent physical theories and at the same time crowns it all with the blessing of a cosmic idealism ! This seems , at first sight , a strange mixture indeed . One may want to ask how can such neutral activity-systems produce mental systems and idealistic-outreaching systems ; and the only answer that seems to come forth is : " Well , such is the case ! " ( Idealists , we pause to remind the reader , are always ready to ask what they regard to be the great embarrassing question to the // materialist , neutralist , and dynamist : how can such a mate-rialistic or neutralistic or dynamistic reality ( or realities ) ever give birth to children which are so much finer and more significant ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal-ist , that the very original and fundamental character of reality is itself spiritual ? ) Though these activity-systems form the ultimate setting for the emergence of such won-derful emergent expressions as materially organized systems and mentally organized systems , they are in themselves mere activity systems and on this basis we feel justified in classify-ing Boodin 's view as dynamistic . The Recent Metaphysical View of Strong Another recent confession of philosophic faith which smacks of the dynamistic interpretation is the late view of fie who had formerly classified himself as an out-and-out panpsychist , Professor C. A. Strong.18 While admitting that the rise of such a phenomenon as " mind " out of the original raw " material " of the non-mental is one of the most real and perplexing questions for contemporary philosophy , never-theless , insists Strong , this is the kind of information that the modern natural sciences give us and we must accept and face it . The ultimate character of reality is a continuous proc-ess out of energy , says Strong . Though modern physics reduces its ultimates to energy , it does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we must give our interpre-tations , thus uniting the respectable in the sciences with ex-perience as a whole . How shall this be done ? My own answer , says Strong , is to say that though fundamental energy is not in itself a " soul " yet it must be at least " soul-ful " or capable of such phenomena which later , in the course of evolution , arise out of it . This may he " a revised materialTHE // ism , " says Strong , but it is about the best that can be said on the basis of scientific information and experience . Thus is Strong 's metaphysics a dynamism with a leaning toward a panpsychistic idealism . Surely , we shall not want to call such a view " a revised materialism " ! The Biotism of Bergson The so-called " biotism " of Henri Bergson ( 1859 ? ) may well fit into the classification of a dynamistic meta-physics , although his writings , so rich and suggestive , have received more than one interpretation . His approach is from the biological sciences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection with the discussion of mysticism.19 For Bergson , reality is a flowing process , an unceasing be-coming . As such it is not a completed process and hence no ' a system and can not be squeezed into one single mold or set of categories . This , for two reasons . First , change evidently can not itself be caught and bound in a single trap ; and sec-ondly , our mental , conceptual-traps are incapable of dealing adequately with it , since concepts are in their very nature static snap-pictures ( and thinking a series of these snaps ) which , therefore , distort the " fluid " reality they aspire to lay hold of just because they fail to grasp continuity or duration . Reality , fundamentally , is life ; it is to be characterized by its positive process , called the elan vital ( vital push ) . Where-as Heracleitus found in a kind of fire-soul the best symbol of this ever-pervasive flux out of which everything moves and in which all has its being , " Bergson finds in Time or Dura-tion the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes . // Nothing , truly , stays put . Time , like Old Man River , keeps " rollin ' along . " Even a thought which is a static snapshot becomes quickly submerged in the stream of duration ; when it is recalled it is not the same , for then it is a recalledthought . Even the telling of all this is most inadequate ( as the reader will see ) because , in the nature of the case , telling implies conceptualizing . What we must do is to drop back into and within immediate experience ? go to our intuitions . Here is where we shall find the real character of that enduring and perduring process which is fundamental reality ; we shall find the past gnawing into the future in a kind of twisted compresence ( so that there are no such things as " point instants " within the process itself ) , a process which is not flowing along smoothly but in a real change ? becoming that is wholly free and unpredictable . Here , for instance , is where the sciences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned ; they treat reality as if it were a set of an even series of causes preceding effects in uniform regularity or as if Nature were , as a process , systematically logical . The truth is there is creative spontaneity in this dynamic-becoming wherein really new and original " moments " appear . Before all this , intellect , language , and the sciences stand helpless ; only through our intuitions ( interior lookings ) do we realize it at all . F'urthermore , this creative process , or Life , gets expressed in two ways : in a movement upward and in a movement downward . In its upward reachings it tends to increase itself in further complexities , storing up accumulated energies in the form of plant-life ( where , however , it got side-tracked in a kind of " unconscious torpor " ) and up through the animal kingdom to the outreachings of a consciousness in which , e.g. , a " pure memory " ties the past and present together and thus reveals the real character of this pulsating reality ; in its downward ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissolution it becomes stagnant in the form // of matter and the systems of mechanism acting continually as a resistance , drag , or inertia to its upward strivings and outreachings . The intellect has as its normal and natural function a dealing with these mechanisms in a world of space and matter ; it , too , is a deposit of that life-process and belongs with other deposits in the space-world ; but it , as we have already said , can not rise of itself to catch the gleam of the upward-reaching process . That gleam which reveals basic reality comes only through the immediate , non-rational experience of duration . The biologist who uses the usual scientific categories of cause-effect can , at best , only get the picture of life in its deposit-form which is a mechanism ; to understand fully he will have to forswear his science and take up the art which comes only by immediate appreciations . This is how and why the natural sciences fail to give the complete picture ; the drag of creative-becoming they give us ( and this has its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is always something " dead " about the subject-matter in the hands of intellectual and scientific categories just because the traps that are set do not catch the elusive which is the real . This is why we must go beyond science if we shall grasp reality " on the wing , " in its inner , pure- and creative-becoming . Reality is not a mystery to us ; it is directly revealed in experience . Bergson 's view presents an almost pure dynamism . Some might hesitate in giving him this classification because of his peculiar notion of a " supra-consciousness " which he thinks is bound up with the universal becoming . " If our analysis is correct , " he says , " it is consciousness , or rather supra-consciousness , that is at the origin of life . Consciousness , or supra-consciousness , is the name for the rocket whose extinguished fragments fall back as matter ; consciousness , again , is the name for that which subsists of the rocket itself , passing through the fragments and lighting them up // into organisms . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and has so been interpreted ) . But a sec-ond look at Bergson 's notion of supra-consciousness appar-ently reveals that he means by it a kind of consciousness-in-general as distinguished from the specific consciousness at the human level ; the former is a broad and vague term cov-ering a kind of incipient awareness which is the genesis of the latter . Thus , in spite of this notion of a supra-conscious-ness which is reality , Bergson 's metaphysics leans more heavily in the direction of a dynamism than it does in that of idealism . Or we should perhaps say it is dynamism touched with a quasi-idealism.22 CHAPTER XII NEUTRALISM WE have defined the fourth general qualitative theory of reality , neutralism , as the view which holds that reality 's fundamental character is essentially neutral , neither mental nor physical , and static rather than dynamic . ' Pythagoreanism Perhaps the first outstanding neutralists in the history of classical thought were the Pythagoreans , followers of Py-thagoras ( c. 580 ? 500 B.C. ) , a semi-legendary figure who , according to tradition , was the first to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , sect , or brotherhood of religious and intellectually minded disciples was felt down through the centuries , particularly through Plato . ' The earlier school , in general , seems to have been influenced by the doc-trines of Anaximander and Anaximenes , 3 developing the idea that the " boundless " of Anaximander and the " air " of Anax-imenes were to be conceived in terms of an infinite ( bound-less ) taking on " form " ( corresponding to the quasi-material " air " ) in the finite ; the later school , following the lead of a certain Philolaus ( whose works are dated about the middle of the fifth century ) undertook to reinterpret and revise the view of the influential Empedocles , who had reduced reality to a plurality of four fundamental elements , ' in characteristic Pythagorean fashion ( as we shall presently see ) . The Pythagoreans ( we shall here characterize them in a collective way ) had taken up and vigorously developed the notion that numbers could be treated by themselves apart 255 // from the mere counting of things ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " ten-ness " apart from , say , ten fingers ) and related with other numbers in a certain kind of numberharmony ; and they had developed further the notion that spatial relationships ( probably first worked out as a theoretical science by the Egyptians in connection with the necessities of land-surveying attending the disappearance of landmarks following the periodic inundations of the Nile ) could be worked out in a logical way , thus developing the sciences of arithmetic and geometry . We do not mean to say that these disciplines all of a sudden originated with them ( for , as is now well known , measurement , which lies back of arithmetical and geometrical ? earth-measuring ? sciences , dates back , so far as is known , to the Babylonians , 2500 B.C. , who , according to discovered tablets , had worked out a basic and elemental system in dealing with numbers ) ; we mean to say that they gave these disciplines their special attention and worked out their implications ( deductions ) in a most significant way . ' In the manipulating of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields of music and medicine . They found their clue to the interpretation of human experience in terms of number : musical harmony , for example , is based upon simple numerical relations of the length of strings ( octave , third , fourth ) ; physical well-being consists in striking certain proportioned relationships between hot and cold , wet and dry , with a proper ( mathematical ) blending of the constitutive elements ( cf. modern chemistry as applied to medicine , especially our drug-store prescriptions ! ) Numbers themselves , moreover , have a certain way // of behaving , so that we may speak of squared numbers ( numbers which are the product of equal factors and which form square-patterns when pictured as dots ) ; of oblong numbers ( those which are the product of unequal ' factors and which form oblong patterns when pictured as dots ) ; triangu-lar numbers ( those whose sum can be pictured in triangular patterns of dots , e.g. , the number three which when pictured as three dots forms a triangle consisting of two dots as base and the single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of number , they applied it in all sorts of ways to things of experience . Some of these ap-plications were crude to the nth degree and led to wild spec-ulations . They carried over into astronomy their notion of musical harmony ; the " music of the spheres " had also a mathematical counterpart in the motions of the heavenly bodies moving at fixed intervals ( which , perhaps , to the mathematically tuned ear was real music ! ) It was but a natural step to think of the whole reality as consisting funda-mentally of numbers ; which , to some of us , may at first seem a strange doctrine indeed ; but it is a doctrine , which in one form or another , has had a respected following in the history of thought . The earlier Pythagoreans gave to philosophy , especially to Greek philosophy , one of its characteristic thoughts , the no-tion of " form " ( which later looms large in the thought of Aristotle and through him in Catholic philosophy ) . From our discussion of the patterns made up from numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlimited can get expressed in a limited , how a formless can assume form , how an ab-stract space can become expressed in concrete figures , and // how ( as they applied it ) the physical world numbers and spatial figures as ultimates to the view of Empedocles by showing that these Empedoclean elements are but compoundings of " figures , " e.g. , fire was determined by the tetrahedron , earth by the cube , air by the octahedron , water by the icosahedron , and , adding a fifth , mother ( a celestial element ) by the dodeca-hedron . Thus , at bottom , mathematical forms are made the essence of the physical world , shaping things according to their own peculiar nature . If all this appears unbelievably crude , try to think of the world as composed of concrete things work-ing and behaving in definite relations one with another . Peer into these relations . What do you find ? The relations ap-pear to be fundamental ; mathematics is able , seemingly , to make predictions of eclipses , planetary behavior , action of tides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fundamental ? Why are these things so ? The answer of the Pythagorean is , because reality consists fundamentally in the kind of char-acter which has its closest affinity with that of numbers and their relations . Thus , when reduced to the lowest terms , mat-ter and mind are but the outward expression of " some-thing(s) " which are more fundamental ; and these ultimates are neutral in character even as numbers and forms are neutral . A Neutralistic Interpretation of Spinoza 's Metaphysics An example of a possible neutralistic naturalism may be had in the metaphysical system of Spinoza . Since we have already given a brief introduction to this great Jewish thinker we need not pause to consider it here except to present the neutralistic interpretation . ' We may once more point out that reality for Spinoza was conceived to be Substance and // that this Substance he identified with Nature , which is to be thought of as an inner-being , essence , or as the insubstantial form . Conceiving it in terms of two aspects , the one he called the natura naturans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God acting ; the natura naturata , the created , nature begotten , or God acted . Mind and matter are but modalities of the same essence ( oi rta ) . If this thought is difficult to grasp , consider the illustration of a curved line ; one aspect of that line is convex , the other concave ; con-vexity and concavity are thus aspects or modalities of the underlying form-giving reality , the line ( the tertium quid ) ; each is distinguishable from the other but inseparable ; con-vexity is not the line nor is concavity the line ; rather , the line is convex as it appears on the " outside " and concave as it appears on the " inside . " Thus if mind and matter be con-ceived as modal appearances , there is something underlying these appearances which is the fundamental and which , by its very nature , though appearing at the same time as mind and matter , is in itself neither mind nor matter . This some-thing is the underlying form and in itself is beyond the categories of mind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its modalities . Thus , reality , while expressing itself as mind and matter , by its very nature is in its essence and in itself neither the one nor the other ; it is , in this sense , neutral ! It is interesting to note that Spinoza " geometrizes " ( as Plutarch is supposed to have said of Plato ) his famous philosophical work , the Ethics , ' thus showing the influence 26o NEUTRALISM in his thought of the mathematical and deductive procedure . A lover , evidently , of order , he found it to his taste to construct a metaphysics on the basis of a cold and logical approach typified in the impersonal forms of Euclidean geometry . Thus is mathematics , once more , made one of the supreme gateways to the proper understanding of the nature of reality ; though , with him , the character of reality lies just beyond even that land of geometrical promise . Neutralism and Phenomenalism The interesting and significant development in modern philosophy referred to as phenomenalism should , perhaps , come in for attention at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory of reality . Glimpses into the thought of Ernst Mach , Richard Avenarius , and the so-called " philosophy of pure experience " and " radical empiricism " of William James will place the phenomenalistic movement squarely before us . The Neutral-Phenomenalism of Mach Ernst Mach ( 1838-1916 ) , a noted physicist who turned philosopher , came to his views , first of all , by calling into question the cocksureness of the physical picture of reality as given by the materialists of his day , attacking especially the mechanical model which the Newtonian orthodoxy had set up in quasi-final form as the one and only respectable view of the mechanism of the physical Universe and which , it was believed , could be applied to the whole of reality ; and , then , by showing in a psychological analysis that , when all is said and done , the molds of reality which are drawn are appearances and as such are related to a sentient organism before which they appear in a peculiar way . This was a terrible blow to dogmatic materialism ; though the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , had taught an unmistakable // phenomenalism and Spencer 's philosophy of Nature-as-it-appears was also a species of phenomenalism ) , ? it had been quite forgotten by men of science of the late nineteenth cen-tury who were not grounded in the history of philosophy . In brief , Mach held that when we speak of a world we must not forget it is the phenomenal ( apparent ) world that we are talking about . We know of no other . Now , what may we say about the appearances ? All we can say is that what physics presents to us is but one type of relationships and psychology another type of relationships , both in the realm of phenomena . We may speak of a color , for example , as physical when we consider it in relation to the source of light , to such other relations as heat , other colors , space , etc . But we know only too well that this is not the only series of relationships in which color seems to be found . We know that color is dependent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such , this type of relationship is psychological . Here we have then the phenomenon of color , which in one set of relationships may be called the physical-set and in another series the psychological-set . The difference lies only in the relational-set . But , one will ask , what is this that gets into these relations ? Mach 's answer places us immediately in the view of neu-tralism : the stuffs ( " elements , " he called them ) in themselves are neither physical nor mental and the world which appears as physical and psychical is but the different ways in which these neutral elements appear ! Color , thus , in itself , is neither physical nor mental . " The whole inner and outer world , " says Mach , in a metaphysical gesture , is " composed of a small number of homogeneous elements connected in relations of varying evanescence or permanence . " 10 Thus in one sweep we are led to a reality which lies underneath the appearances , neutral in character , but entering into relation- // ships which appear on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Neutral-Phenomenalism of Avenarius Preceding William James , in this general line of thought , was Richard Avenarius ( 1843 ? 96 ) who , though working independently of Mach , arrived at similar conclusions and laid down the rule which has become the slogan of the " phi-losophy of pure experience " : " nothing exists save experi-ence . " He may well be considered the father of this type of phenomenalistic philosophy . The absolute division of an inner and outer world , he maintained , is an illusion due to a false perspective ; 11 so also the absolute division of thoughts and things ; so also the absolute distinction among the com-plex elements ( thoughts , sentiments , volitions ) which go to make up the so-called Ego . Everything belongs together in the same realm of a common underlying experience which exists in all its purity independently of anything else . The only legitimate reason that can be given for speaking of " dif-ferent things " ( like a tree , the self , feeling ) is that of a difference in the relations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus the world of reality melts in a kind of broth into a neutral system of differently related elements which are experience . The special task for philosophy , thinks Avenarius , is to rid itself of the notions of an impure experience which sees things as fundamentally different and from provincial and illusory points-of-view . How shall this pure-experience be conceived ? The answer of Avenarius : as a totality of all these homogeneous ( like ) elements which " just are " or , in other words , which consti-tute pure-experience . Thus , reality is neither idealistic , nor materialistic , nor dynamistic . It is pure-experience. // Neutralism and James 's " Pure Experience " and " Radical Empiricism " If the above exposition is still not clear , we hope that a look at William James 's version of it will bring light . When we speak of William James 's ( 1842 ? 1910 ) metaphysics , we feel that a sense of injustice is being done him . This is for two reasons : first , he had a real distaste for anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion . His was a philosophy of pragmatism ( irpciy , aa , the Greek word for " action , " from which our words " practice " and " prac-tical " come ) , which was content to stay at home with matters of practical handling instead of soaring to the uncharted and unchartable skies of wild speculation . Trained in the rigor-ous methods of the modern sciences ( he was a doctor of medicine , a professor of anatomy and physiology before he taught psychology and philosophy ) , and having positivistic12 leanings , he rebelled , as we have already stated , 13 against such flights of fancy , as he thought , as that of Hegel and others . For him , metaphysics consisted in " only thinking about things in the most comprehensive way . " Secondly , his phi-losophy was not , in the very nature of the case , the work of a systematizer who is bent upon fitting every part nicely with every other . It was only in later years that he planned to bring his several theories together ; and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to philosophy lay rather in the daring and originality of his thought and the glow of presentation ; in his keen criticisms and brilliant polemics ; in his ability to search out and tap , to advantage , sources from widely scat-tered areas , which comes only to one having a wide acquaint-ance with literature of all kinds and in many tongues . To // have attempted to chisel out a work of philosophic art was foreign to his unquenching thirst for new insights ; his was the role of an adventurer in philosophy , enjoying the sur-prises that came with the turning of thoughts and pressing on for more thrills in discovery . It came to be increasingly clear to him that , after all , any interpretation of life and its mysteries must come through first-hand experience ; and when others testified of their own , he sought sympathetically for confirmations within his own.15 There was for him gen-uine fun and sport in following up the various " leads , " no matter how queer or seemingly foolish , which came to him ; and with a hearty zest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untried for many , thus often leading the way for others to follow.16 Thus it is that we find him launching out in characteristic fashion for things new and old.17 It was but natural that the " philosophy of pure experience " should strike a responsive chord with him in its emphasis upon the data of immediate experience as the beginning and source of philosophical wis-dom . However , he put the imprint of his own thinking upon it ; when he was through with it , he had made it radical and baptized it with the name " radical empiricism . " 18 With this background we are ready to examine this point of view as it passed through his mind and relate it to a theory of reality . It will be remembered that the slogan of Hegel 's intellec-tual idealism may be summarized by the rhythmic : " the rational is the real and the real is the rational " ; 19 in similar fashion the slogan of James 's " philosophy of pure experiNEUTRALISM // ence " may be set up to the tune of : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced . " Now , what is this ex-perienced experience , according to James ? In the first place , as we have already pointed out , 20 he found the concept of a " soul " ( as a kind of mysterious entity or metaphysical principle ) a clumsy hypothesis for psychology ; because intro-specting experience , he claimed , does not reveal such an entity-as-such and because , as used by psychologists , such a . concept merely substitutes a name for an explanation.21 Instead of such a metaphysical something as a " soul " we find in experience a multiplicity of elements bound together in a unity or stream ; such findings are sufficient data for psy-chology , he thinks ; there is no need to appeal to any such " hobgoblin " as did the older psychologists . Thus , conscious-ness , as revealed in experience , is a stream of passing " ele-ments , " not as so many pieces or drops , but as ripples which pass continuously and melt into one another in a lively be-coming . Thus there is a multiplicity and unity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to consciousness ; " it " is not a something looking spectator-like down upon the scene ; " it " is that scene itself ! Secondly , in thus " analyzing " experience , James came to the bold conclusion that not only separate " things " appearing in this stream are the real data concerning the world of ex-perience ( the phenomena which appear ) but also the very relational stream itself presents data of equal importance . Here is something that the older psychologists failed to notice . They thought that what is given in experience is a series of simple and isolated sensations , 22 whereas the fact of the matter is that relations are as much a part of the orig-inal data of experience as anything else . We are now touch-ing his radical empiricism . Consider our language : do not such // words as " but , " " because , " " on condition that , " " neither , " and the like reveal real sensory content , real experiences ? Do not prepositions and conjunctions reveal as significant data of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these items and processes of experience the real data of the world for us ? Must we appeal to a metaphysical " what-not " to join together experienced elements which have already been joined in experience itself ? Now add to all this the famous postulate which he set down in a truly positivistic spirit : " The postulate is that the only things that shall be debatable among philosophers shall be things definable in terms drawn from experience . Things of an unexperienceable nature may exist ad libitum , but they form no part of the material for philosophic debate. " 23 Thus we have it : the real is the experienceable and the experi-enceable consists of passing elements and relations in the experienced stream ! Not only is this the only reality that is " known , " but it is reality ! But a further qualifying word must be added to give the Jamesean picture . We must distinguish between two quali-ties of experience : the kind of experience which is shot through and through with all kinds of ideational notions , such as beliefs , superstitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us away from " that which is " by its luggage of erroneous and sophisticated notions ) , and then we must dis-tinguish the " pure " experience which lies underneath ( so to speak ) all these ideas as so much raw data . So far as the " stuff " of ideas and " pure " experience are concerned , they are alike ; their difference is rather of degree of quality , the latter is the fundamental and primordial " purity , " while the former consists of accretional impurities ( if we may interpret it thus ) . By relaxing into this pure-experience we may , says James , get the " feel " of it ; conceptualizing it is most inadeNEUTRALISM // quate ; for we must beware of trusting too much our concepts and sophistication which are mischief-makers . ( James had a certain mistrust for logic ; naturally here he found in Bergson24 a kindred spirit . ) And , finally , this pure-experience was for him not a mere " subjective " state ; it is rather " objective , " " external @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subjective as over against an objective since these are distinctions , as he thought , cooked up by our conceptual constructions ) . To use his own apt term , the world is " sciousness " ? the kind of blissful social-objectivity which a person experiences when coming out of the influence of anaesthetics ! Fundamentally , there is , accordingly , no duality of subject and object in the realm of pure-experience . That realm , for James , seems to be both objective and phenomenal ! " Where are we now ? " the reader may be asking . We have arrived upon the scene of reality , which consists in a sum-total of experience that is " a that , an absolute , a pure ' experience on an enormous scale , undifferentiated and undifferentiable into thought and thing . " 25 Thus it appears that we have found our way into a neutral realm where the so-called " physical " thing-world and the " psychical " thought-world have dissolved into a kind of pure broth of appearance-being ( phenomenalism ) ! A queer place , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for James " queer " notions were not necessarily wrong notions ! Well , anyway , are n't life and experience " queer , " after all ? Unfortunately for us ( or , shall we say " fortunately " ? ) James does not leave us with any clear-cut notion of this realm of " purity " ; but we forgive him , for had he not already intimated that our notions are impure ? The " philosophy of pure experience " has had a wide influence among contemporary philosophers . As the plot thickens we shall find certain thinkers following the " lead " of James and taking inspiration and courage in pursuing the // path he was marking out . As the reader will want to have this development clearly before him , we announce , at once , that we have now come back to the New Realistic movement of thought , which , in its American variety ( as we have stated before26 ) , was given an impetus by this pioneering thinker . Neutralism and New Realism In a preceding chapter we traced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general and then followed it as it issued in the current which led in the direction of materialism . We are ready now to follow the other current which came out of it but which led in the direc-tion of neutralism.27 Our order of procedure will be , first , to present a typical example of New **29;606;TOOLONG of the English variety and then to discuss a few examples of the American . We begin with a celebrated name in current philosophical and social thinking , Bertrand Rus-sell . The New Realism and Logical Atomism of Bertrand Russell To the popular mind , Russell ( 1872 ? ) is known more as a social reformer than as a metaphysician ; to the profes-sional philosopher he is known rather as a metaphysical re-former . It seems that to whatever area he applies his keen analytic mind he sees , in the traditional modes of behavior and thinking , some things that need recasting . Convention-alities of thought appear to him as fraught with crime as those in social practice ; thus , out for reform in both , we find him from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( as a consistent reformer as such may have to do ) , changing his opinions as he publishes , glad to make confes-sion of these changes , and making it difficult to give him // systematic interpretation . Philosophy with him is real think-ing ; it consists chiefly of careful analysis of thought-con-structions ( logic ) , especially in looking to exact meaning of terms ; it consists in piecing together boldly by hypothetical formulae the various deliverances of the special sciences ; it can only aim to give tentative interpretations since , for us , " truth " is in the making and hence can not be laid out neatly in any final , dogmatic , and systematic whole . He came to philosophy as a skilled mathematician and that bias colors his whole view of reality . By mathematics he set out to reform logic . The Aristotelian logic he found to be old and narrow in its perspective , dealing as it did with only a few standard and obvious forms of propositions , with the implications of these forms worked out by the method of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ; it is a discourse or argument in which ? three proposi-tions are so related that from two propositions a third ? or conclusion ? follows . ) He insists that traditional logic needs the supplementation of mathematical or symbolic logic ( called " symbolic " because it makes use of symbols as short-cut and exact notations of meanings ) because this " newer logic " makes for more exact reasoning and extends the area of reasoning to include not only the complex varieties of experience ( with which the old logic is incapable of dealing because it is too simple ) but also the multitudinous possibili-ties of the yet-unexperienced.28 It is his view that the kind of logic one uses determines the kind of metaphysics one will have . If one hopes to arrive at a defensible theory of reality , one must be exceedingly careful of one 's tools , i.e. , of one 's // method of reasoning . Accordingly , if logic needs reform , philosophy , dependent upon logic , is in need of reform . The fault with much of traditional philosophies is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all sorts of fanciful and over-simplified theories have resulted . Behold only such fallacious systems as , for example , have been constructed by Hegel and Bradley ? thinks Russell . This modern Pythagorean calls his system of reform " logical atomism , " and he comes to his own theory some-what as follows . First , what is this thing we call " matter " ? It appears that it is a kind of hard stuff having the quality of independence and stubborn persistency . Well , is this so ? Modern physicists are reducing this " stuff " into elements so fine that only a mathematical physicist can comprehend its ultimate nature . The result , according to Russell , is a set of logical constructions or symbolic fictions which are workable expressions of very complicated assemblages of facts . Again , what is this thing we call mind ? It is not a something like a bag containing ideas ; but an assemblage of particulars to be appropriately designated as " mental . " Now , putting the " physical " constructions and the " mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamentally reducible to entities and relations which are neither physical nor mental in themselves , but rather neutral ; a world of multiplicity of external relations , facts , particulars . Thus , Russell 's reality is fundamentally similar to the reality of Plato , a realm of objective , eternal entities , though for Russell these entities are not " eternal ideas " but mere logically atomistic entities plus a multitude of external relations , both actual and pos-sible. " // In a summary sketch30 he pictures ( as a tentative hypoth-esis ) the structure of the world as consisting of entities having various qualities and relations with one another ; each of these entities may well be called an " event " and each event is to be considered as having a relation to a certain number o , f other events in ways called " compresent . " By compresence is meant literally existing together ( for instance , a person 's sensations , images , thoughts , memories , etc. , coexisting all at once ) . For the physicist a collection of compresent events all occupy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that world certain regions of compresent events behave in certain ways , we have the phenomenon known as " matter " and when they behave in certain other ways ( habit-forming ) , these matter-regions ( especially those o , f nervous tissue ) form the phenomenon known as " mind . " " A mind , " Russell says , " is a track of sets of compresent events in a region of // space-time where there is matter which is peculiarly liable to form habits . " A mind , thus , is not to be thought of as fun-damentally distinct from brain-matter ; rather , when we speak of mind , we are considering a peculiar set of compresent events within a given region ; and when we speak of brain-matter , we are considering a peculiar set of compresent events within that same region taken as a whole and their external relation to other sets of compresent events taken as a whole . We must add a word about Russell 's New Realism in this very sketchy account of his general philosophy . It will be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mind " is not something apart from " its " world ; 31 mental functioning enters into the very warp and woof of reality and is that reality functioning " mentally . " Thus there is no impassable chasm between " matter " and " mind , " since the two are brought together by an underlying and fundamental reality which has produced them and which , in itself , is neither the one nor the other . With mind-as-such gone , with matter-as-such disappearing into the shades of " something " ulterior to itself , and with the whole of reality thought of in terms and relations anal-ogous to those used in pure mathematics , we have a picture of reality that is quantitatively pluralistic and qualitatively monistic , i.e. , neutralistic . The New Realism of Holt and Neutralism Brief mention will be made of two other New Realistic thinkers who have made neutralism their metaphysical stamp-ing-ground . We choose two American philosophers to show that not all New Realistic Americans have gone the way of materialism ? the pioneer American neutralist of this school , E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the six platformists already mentioned , " and both profoundly // influenced by James 's doctrines of consciousness and radical empiricism.33 For Holt the world of reality consists of a plurality of neutral elements , logical terms and propositions which give rise to a variety of complexes by their entering into a variety of group or class relations . What we call " mind " is one class or group of these neutral entities ; what we call " matter " is another class or group . Consciousness is like a searchlight that illuminates the " landscape " of these neutral entities without changing them ; " it " is that cross-section of the environment which is illuminated . Note , again , the panob-jectivism with " mind " and " matter " submerged in more ultimate categories , neutralistic in character.34 The New Realism of Perry and Neutralism In characteristic American New Realistic fashion , Pro-fessor Perry of Harvard disposes of **26;637;TOOLONG to go the way of methodological behaviorism of the extreme type.35 This he does somewhat as follows : the so-called " mind within " and the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other the mind-observed-in-action ? he asserts , are aspects of a common underlying " mind " which in turn is a part of the general field of " experience " ; but the " mind within " does not reveal what generally goes under the name of introspection ( the claim , for instance , that a self , sui generis , is disclosed within ) ; what is revealed is nothing more than objects or " a chaotic manifold of frag-ments of the other-than-mind . " Accordingly , to know what " mind " is , one must see " it " in terms of these objects ; or , in other words , one must observe the " mind without " as " it " is linked with the general field of experience . Thus , we have // extreme methodological behaviorism , in that introspection ( in the usual sense ) is denied to have any significance . Next , Perry goes on to show that that underlying mind which has its setting in the stream of experience is a part of Nature ; that underlying " mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neural organism behaving in a certain peculiar way . Here , then , extreme methodological behaviorism turns to a radical metaphysical behaviorism.36 We should expect that this view would land definitely in a materialistic meta-physics ; but not so , for Perry interprets the " physical " organism as ultimately constituted of logical entities or a plurality of neutral elements . In asserting this he makes the appeal ( which we have found characteristic of Bertrand Rus-sell ) that physical science has by a critical analysis been reduced to simpler non-physical terms , that physics is bearing continual testimony to the wider and more fundamental truths of logic and mathematics . A word further may show how radically Perry 's New Realism turns toward a neutralistic interpretation . The cardinal principle of New Realism , he says , is that things are what they are independent of any relation . Knowing a thing , for instance , makes no difference to that thing . The term " neutral entities " as characteristic of fundamental real-ity ( or , in his own words , an expression referring " to the alphabet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the loose word experience , however " pure . " 37 For when the term experience is used , the tendency is to relate the experi-enced to an experiencer ( as in the case of phenomenalism ) and thus unduly to emphasize the relation of an experiencer and thus qualify the experienced . What New Realism means to assert is that things are what they are without any relation . Where are they ? Just nowhere . They are somewhere when they enter into relationships ; but when they so enter they bring with them a character which they possess " quite indeTHE // pendently and by themselves . " Thus reality consists of pure neutral beings unlocalizable in themselves ; the ultimate and irreducible entities which everything that is turns out funda-mentally to be ! 3s Thus , to sum up , mind has dissolved as an entity inde-pendent and sui generis ( and with this goes idealism , the great foe of the New Realists ) into the peculiar behavior of a neural organism ; and that same organism has dissolved by analysis into behaving neutral entities being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into non-behaving being and in themselves nowhere ! Thus is the world of circumstance in itself and stripped of all appear-ances ! It doth appear that here we have a metaphysical neutralistic behaviorism gone mad ! 33 Some Summary Remarks on Neutralism Should the reader think , by this time , that the neutralistic interpretation of reality is confined to only a few philosophi-cal souls , we give the warning that if space allowed we could cite further examples from among those who stand high in the world of philosophic thought . Neutralism is arrived at , as it may have been noted by the reader , through the process of analysis ; it agrees with idealism in affirming that things are fundamentally not what they appear to be , that real Real-ity in itself is something much more subtle than what the senses uncritically reveal and something even more funda-mental than ideas and mental life as such . Neutralists , like the idealists , would not , in general , wish to have their view // interpreted to mean the denial of the physical outright ; they only mean to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ category of reality . Similarly , the neutralists would not mean to deny that there is such a phenomenon as mental life ; they mean only to show that fundamental reality lies much deeper than that category ; in doing so , of course , both the physical and mental are reinterpreted ( in a number of different ways , as has been observed ) in terms of the ultimate category of neutralism . Neutralism and Certain Expressions of Absolute Idealism In concluding this section we should like to point out that the neutralistic New Realists arrive at a conclusion in regard to the fundamental character of reality quite similar to some absolute idealists . This may seem indeed strange , since they have confessed all along their mutual incompatibility . When such idealists as , for example , F. H. Bradley and B. Bosan-quet40 come by way of logical reasoning to determine the nature of the all-inclusive reality , the result of such reason-ing they show to be ( Bradley , particularly ) somewhat nega-tive ; for the finite reason is incapable of dealing fully with the super-Whole ; finite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of that Whole , but it can not light up the whole landscape of that Whole . Thus , reality in its funda-mental and ultimate nature lies even beyond the reaches of our intellectual constructions in a realm purer than the purest thoughts . We do not mean to say that these Absolutists would call their view of ultimate reality neutralistic ; but that they are very close to such a view is quite appa.rent.41 CHAPTER XIII OTHER INTERPRETATIONS OF REALITY IN an introductory survey we can hardly attempt to point out all the classical varieties of interpretations which have been given to the nature of reality . We have thus far given examples of some outstanding varieties of idealism , materialism , dynamism , and neutralism ? four major points of view . There remain , however , a number of other views , some of which have figured prominently in philosophical discussions and which do not readily lend themselves to the above classification . The Hylomorphism of Aristotle We begin with the so-called hylonaorphism of Aristotle ( 384 ? 322 B.C. ) . The word hylomorphism comes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and form ( . ? o ) . Since the Aristotelian picture of reality has been so tremendously influential in the history of Western thought and still is dominant through the Thomistic ( called after St. Thomas Aquinas , ? " the Angelic Doctor " ? 1225 ? 74 ) philosophical tradition in modern Catholic orthodoxy , an acquaintance with this theory should be made . Aristotle , it is well known , was a disciple for some twenty years of the " divine " Plato ; but he turned out to be a rebellious disciple , modifying the teachings of his teacher considerably and finally setting up his own school , known as the Lyceum . The great teacher 's interest lay in the realm of ideas and the idea-sciences such as mathematics ; the great pupil 's interest lay , chiefly , in things close at hand such as the natural sciences ( especially the biological ) . The characteristic fea-277 // ture of Aristotelian science is that of collection of a mass of heterogeneous data ( which he accomplished on such a tre-mendous scale that his science influenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classification of the material thus gathered . ' Plato 's universals with their existence ( or shall we say subsistence ? ) in the realm of pure being formed an intolerable theory to this matter-of-fact mind ; to him , reality is here and now , in space and time , in things and substances . Matter for him was to be explained and not explained away . The world of physical reality was for him not a shadowy existence as such , even though the world reveals change , becoming , and decay . What , for him , needed explanation was this change which he observed in nature , a change which appeared to be according to an order ; and to account for this change he borrowed suggestions from his great teacher . The reality of the world of corporeal substance was a first article in his creed ; the reality of change ( motion , becoming , growth , decay , and the like ) was a second article in his creed ; what he needed to make that creed intelligible was a third article to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the principle of " form " ; a principle seemingly as abstract as Plato 's notion of " idea " but unlike that " abstract " notion in that for him " form " was a dynamic , energizing principle at home in the world of the physical order and working in Nature , shaping and controlling things and accounting for their existence , nature , and behavior . There is thus a strong Platonic note in Aristotelianism , though there is ( according // to some interpreters ) scarcely a perceptible Aristotelian note in Platonism . Thus with matter and form united , we have the hylosnorphisin which characterizes this system of meta-physics.2 Thus Mr. X-the-man is the embodied form of which the Young X-the-youth was the matter ; the Young X-the-youth is the embodied form of which the X-the-baby-boy was the matter ; the baby-boy the embodied form and the embryo the matter ; and so on . Thus everything in Nature reveals this process of realization of an immanent working principle , this process of embodying the pattern-possibilities . To account for this panorama of realization-process ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he decided that back of the whole movement was an unmoved Mover , a Being , incor-poreal , indivisible , spaceless , changeless , perfect , eternal , pure energy , pure form , which is God . The process is that of a movement ( not a creation ) of an unmoved Mover ; and this is the account of how the **28;665;TOOLONG ( matter in its functional sense ) become **31;695;TOOLONG by means of this form-shaping movement . Since Aristotle 's philosophy is so full of startling incon-sistencies , an exact classification is difficult . For instance , it seems that he makes " motion " fundamental to his whole metaphysics and interprets God in terms of pure energy . Yet , on the other hand , corporeal substance seems to be regarded as eternal , and motion reverts to a kind of unutter-able " stillness " in an Unmoved Mover . We have , accord-ingly , preferred to give Aristotle the separate classification as above and call his metaphysics by the double-category con-tained in the term " hylomorphism . " It must be said that the Aristotelian system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given only a general sketch of the system as a whole ; particular phases of it will be considered later . Many so-called Neo-scholastics of our day believe , in gen-eral , that the metaphysics of Aristotle as revised and " puri280 OTHER INTERPRETATIONS OF REALITY fled " by St. Thomas Aquinas furnishes not only the best but the final key to the interpretation of Reality . ' Some More or Less Negative Reactions to a Metaphysical Theory To any endeavor there will always be , it seems , a few who will say that the thing can not be done . We have such folk // who stand on the side-lines and chuckle when others are try-ing to peer into the mysteries of reality . For them it is a hopeless task . We shall not consider the views of those who dogmatically affirm a negative view on the question , for such are truly not philosophers . We shall pay our respects , how-ever , to those who come to their more or less negative views // and at the same time are willing to offer what they regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may judge for himself whether or not this negative and agnostic stand or tendency is the necessary or the better one to take ; or whether one or other of the views suggested above seems to hold , at least , the possible key to unlock that seeming mystery . A few samples of a negative character from some conspicu-ous thinkers will close this chapter . ' The Negative Note in the Metaphysics of Ho ff ding Consider , first , the claim of Professor Hoffding ( 1843-1931 ) , a noted Danish philosopher . We think that reality consists of two forms of existences , he says , since we seem to be able to break it up in the two distinguishable features of the physical and the psychical . Suppose we knew only two colors ; should we not incline to the view that there were then only the two ? But we know that light can be broken up into a great many more colors than these two . May not , by analogy , reality be infinitely more complex in character than what our metaphysicians have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present limited perspective and say that reality is only what it now appears to us ? 5 Furthermore , the only respectable way we can know the world of circumstance , he says , is to apply the method adopted by the natural sciences which insists upon the principle of natural causation , i.e. , that the unknown must be reduced to the known in terms of a causal series , one event must be related causally to another event in our experience . Thus , really to know , one must set up a series of causally related interconnections between events of experience . Now two difficulties beset us , he says , in this our only respectable method : first , we find gaps in the series of causal connections and , secondly , we have only a fragment of a total possibility of an unending series of causal connections . The first difficulty should make us pause before we affirmed too much about the nature of reality and the second difficulty should show us plainly that to speak of the whole of reality is noth-ing less than presumptuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole pack with only a few cards on the table ? In-deed , we know only in part and that is mighty little ! Only omniscience can presume to orate on the question of reality such as it totally is. ? Reality , accordingly , remains for us // only an ideal concept of a possibility of totality ; a possibility , however , which may never be realized since reality itself may be in the state of perpetual becoming ! Dewey 's Philosophical Reformation and Positivistic Gospel Consider next the view of Professor Dewey in regard to this whole quest for the nature of reality . In a remarkably stimulating book entitled Reconstruction in Philosophy ( 192o ) , 7 a book which may well serve as a supplementary introduction to the field of philosophy even though it is written from the Deweyan " bias , " Professor Dewey assails the traditional wrestlings with the fictitious angel of an Ab-solute Truth and the futile search for an ultimate reality and preaches a ? rigorous doctrine of philosophical reform . People in general , and a good many philosophers in particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the world of work , worry , and change and have sought refuge in an ideal realm of " pure " being where permanence , serenity , and com-placency hold sway ? a realm upon which their tired souls may rest in museful contemplation . Reality thus has been clothed with the cloak of ideals seemingly impossible of reali-zation in the world of sense . Now , says Dewey , all this is very beautiful ; but , instead of furnishing us with a picture of reality , such views rather reveal to us broken spirits . There is a psychology back of this ontology . We should be moved with pity for those who have given up the game of real life in favor of a realm ? of imaginary and unmitigated bliss . The only reality we know , says Dewey , is the here and now ; a world of change and // challenge , a world that requires for survival a never-ceasing activity and serious adjustments , a world which requires of us not contemplation but action . What men need to do is to cease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstract being and shake themselves out of their **27;728;TOOLONG and courageously face the world wherein they move and have their being . Our place of activity , such as it really is , is right here ; it is on the side of him who accepts its challenges in a heroic spirit and does something with them ; , it is not on the side of the cowards who seek to shake off their responsibilities by running under cover in an imaginary existence of pure being . All we have to do with is the-being-in-the-rough . Now , if philosophy is to remain true to its real function , it must furnish us with ideals and ideas as tools to help us make the adjustments just where we are . Its concern should be to roll up its sleeves in helping to lighten the burdens of mankind , to remove errors in thinking , to master the world of nature by revealing to us the better ways of contact and adjustment . For us there can be no Absolute Truth ; in a world of change a changeless truth is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in a world of change being is becoming . It is enough that we make our contacts in the very best way we can with life-situations ; that is all that can be required of us , the world of circumstance being what it is . Metaphysical speculations have led men astray ; philosophy needs reform , and that reformation must turn us away from questions of the ultimate nature of things to the things close at hand , which require our undivided attention if we wish to meet successfully the only kind of reality we know . Dewey 's position , accordingly , is not only that such a question as the ultimate Nature of reality is futile but that it is tragic ; our first and supreme concern is to clean up our back-yards of the refuse of mistaken notions , errors , illu286 OTHER INTERPRETATIONS OF REALITY sions , unethical practices , social misunderstandings , and cease our gazing toward a world-in-itself of profitless imagination . Thus the positivist 's " solution " to the question of the ages is not only that these questions are futile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to make this confession of sin , repent of their evil ways , and arise new and reconstructed creatures to lead men in pointing out better ways with which to grapple the hard world of circumstance . The Problematic Metaphysics of Loewenberg In a keenly analytic ( and recent ) essay8 Professor Loe-wenberg of the University of California holds that the most we can say about reality is that it is ; the what of the that , which presupposes a that , is for us only a tentative set of descriptions . For scientific investigations ( and all knowl-edge ) move from position to position as new data are un-covered and old data reinterpreted- by the new . In other words , we start with a given substance , the that , and then we proceed to ask what is the nature of the that ? In answering this question we shall have to admit in the realms of both the sciences and philosophy that our " whats " are only tentative judgments , requiring from time to time revision and correc-tion and at no point dare we say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what of the that . The one thing we are sure of in this quest for an understanding of reality is that reality is and that whatever we say of this " is " is problematic ; and , moreover , we will have to say because of this endless process of trying to find out the nature of reality that it must be pretty complex since it seems to permit no one and final set but an inexhaustible supply of descriptions . The very term " ultimate " is ambiguous and requires defiSKEPTICISM // nition , he thinks . We should mean by that term the outward reach of analysis and not the final possible end or status of things . The physical sciences , for instance , may reduce the what of the that to the limit of reducibility ; but that limit is not necessarily a final one ; in the onward march of scientific investigation that limit may be pushed even still further and thus an ultimate , too , is only problematic . Thus real Reality is , but can not be " ultimately " described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize their quarrels as having very deep foundations of truth , viz. , that the rea-son-there is so much disagreement from every side is the fact that whatever is said can only be problematic of a very subtle , complex , and inexhaustible " That " ! Thus we have a " meta-physics of skepticism. " 9 The Metaphysical Skepticism and Faith of Cohen Like many others Professor M. R. Cohen of the College of the City of New York argues that we can not speak of a Universe as a Totality since our knowledge of Totality is too fragmentary ; and whatever we say of anything rests upon indemonstrable assumptions ; and , further , the Universe is not known to us to be definitely complete since there are an infinite number of yet-unactualized possibilities ; and , still further , the Universe is not in existence at any one time ! The whole question is too complicated for such a narrow vision as we have ; there is always the element of the unknown and the possible . Whatever , however , is , is real ; for everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as alleged truth , whatever else we may say about them , are . The key to the understanding of " what is , " thinks Cohen , // is the principle of polarity . Reality seems to be best under-stood by means of paired relations : for example , whatever we say about the physical world we have to say in terms of logic so that in our interpretation of it we have a union of " form " with " matter . " Other polarity illustrations are : things and relations , action and reaction , force or change and inertia , growth and decay , necessity and contingency , unity and plurality , identity and difference , mediacy and imme-diacy , activity and passivity , being and non-being , continuity and discreteness , actuality and possibility ; these dichotomies like the north and the south poles in the phenomenon of magnetism are distinct from one another while at the same time inseparable . Thus systems of metaphysics which have set up one set of categories to the exclusion of others have been hopelessly one-sided and simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceedingly complex . The principle of polarity shows how seeming opposites can be related without destroy-ing this complexity of their co-existential significances . Real-ity , as it is known to us , is both One and Many , both matter and form , both actual and possible , both being and non-being and becoming , both matter and " spirit , " both mechanical and spontaneous . There are domains in reality where logical relationships hold sway and domains where physical relation-ships rule , a plurality of domains co-existing with definite sets of characteristics , opposite but real and inseparable . Total Reality , however , is too inclusive and complex to be captured in any trap of nicely and simply wrought-out syn-theses ; the possibilities of that Totality far outrun our best imaginings . To picture Reality-as-It-is is a preposterous job , a hopeless task , though , says Cohen , we can " bite into " that reality and obtain a " probable " interpretation of it . " // " THE STRIFE OF SYSTEMS " ? A SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE We conclude this chapter ( which concludes our discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested student who sees something of significance in the various quantitative and qualitative interpretations of reality that he make the acquaintance of a book entitled Strife of Systems and Productive Duality ( 1918 ) by Professor W. H. Sheldon of Yale . He will find here the various major metaphysical views critically yet sympathetically discussed in terms of catholicity and harmony . While Professor Sheldon 's own metaphysics is admittedly not worked out here in terms of a final picture of the " macrocosm " ( and hence we have not undertaken to give him a classification ) he suggests a principle by which , he thinks , peace can be achieved out of the metaphysical wars . Whatever else reality is , he holds , it is " through and through dual " and lends itself to " opposing " interpretations . ( Cf. Cohen 's position , above . ) These " oppositions , " however , are not mutually antagonistic in the sense of being in ultimate conflict but are mutually supplementary and contributory . But this is not all : they do not merely stand over against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and creatively produce various expressions of that reality . In other words , the principle of productive duality is the key to the understanding of how reality is " built up " and the solution of the wars of opposing schools of thought . Philosophical systems have been barren , he maintains , because of their exclusiveness . Reality ( whatever else it is ) is dyadic in structure and character , i.e. , it is expressed in terms of oppositions related as " two-in-one " ; it is One and Many ; it is static and dynamic ; it is deterministic and free ; it is Universal ( whole , social ) and it is particular ( individualistic ) ; it is spiritual and material ; it is symmetrical and asymmetrical ; it is abstract and concrete ; it is inclusive and exclusive ; and so on . Is , then , an ultimate monism or an ultimate dualism implied in this principle of productive duality ? Answer : an analysis of the " microcosm " would suggest that it is " either or both . " More fundamentally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternation " of " opposites . " Professor Sheldon ( in a letter to the author ) gives the metaphysical key-thought of his book as follows : " I think the Universe is an assemblage of asymmetrical dyads created by an original dyad . " The principle of denial ( so common in historic metaphysical systems ) in which it is affirmed that the opposing view is in // error and therefore unreal is reinterpreted to mean that the opposing view is not to be negated in the sense of being unreal ( there is nothing unreal , not even error ) but in the sense of being the other-side-to-the-matter . The strife of systems , in other words , is to be resolved into a harmony of systems in the recognition that our negations are but affirmations of that character of otherness of reality . " Disagreements in philosophy , " Sheldon holds , " are due to exclusive emphasis on one member of any given dyad . " CHAPTER XIV THE PUZZLING INFINITE ONE can hardly treat such concepts as space and time without asking some such questions as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is space extending infinitely in every direction ; and is time enduring forever ? Is there a limit or end to space ; is there a beginning or end to time ? Can space , time , or anything be cut into an infinite number of infinitesimal parts ? Granting the infinite divisibility of space , time , and things , what consequences may follow ? Can they , like Humpty-Dumpty , never be put together again ? We are here touching one of the queerest sets of questions which philosophy has to present and one which has racked the minds of some of our very greatest thinkers . Let us taste some sample dishes cooked up by the notion of the infinitesimally small and the infinitely great and note the peculiar gastronomic effects to which these notions give rise . The Paradoxes of Zeno No consideration of the topic we have before us would be complete without reference to that philosophical gad-fly , Zeno of Elea in Southern Italy ( c. 490 ? 430 B.C. ) , whose para-doxical stings have been a source of contention in the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his philosophical teacher , Parmenides of Elea . ' In opposition to the Heracleitean view which held that nothing stays put , everything moves , ' stands the so-called Eleatic school of ancient thinkers who held that everything that is stays put . Only the One exists , and that One is changeless , eternal , indivisible , unmovable . Nothing is be292 THE PUZZLING INFINITE yond this Being ; it is impossible for a non-being to be . Crea-tion is impossible , since something can not arise from noth-ing ; destruction is impossible , because something can not be-come nothing . ' Change , moreover , is impossible , because whatever is can not be different from what it is . Accordingly , the appearances which come through sense-perception sug-gesting change , multiplicity , time and space are illusions which can be corrected only through the medium of thought . True being is thought , the one unchanging reality . If we say that space is real , then it is Being ; and Being , accordingly , moves in Being , which is to say that Being is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real , then of course it does not exist and nothing can move ( for how can things move without space ? ) . Parmenides is the leading philosopher of this school . Now , Zeno , a very wise young disciple of the philosopher of a block-reality , sought to sustain his master by extending the paradoxes to the limit , or what we would now call a reductio ad absurdum . To strengthen this block-philosophy he did as many proponents seek to do : he threw stones at the position of his opponents . " If you do n't believe me , I will at any rate show you that your opposing position is all muddled . " This was the spirit of the attack of Zeno ; and his opponents , of course , were those who held that motion and change were real . And with the concepts of motion and change are involved the concepts of space and time ; for space was considered to be the container , the " somewhere " in which objects could move , and time plainly involves succession . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying arrow . Now that an arrow may move it must succes-sively occupy a series of positions . That is clear . But , no matter what position we choose in this series of positions that arrow is in a particular place and therefore at rest . Add-ing all these particular places of rest will never in the world give motion ; hence the arrow can not fly ! // Consider the famous hypothetical race between Achilles and the tortoise . Achilles of course runs faster than the tortoise and , as a gentleman , assumes a handicap in the race by allowing the tortoise to begin at an advanced position . The race is on ! Try as he will Achilles can not overtake the tortoise ; for , when he has reached the starting-point of the tortoise , the latter will already have moved ahead , say to position B ; and when Achilles reaches the position B , the tortoise will have moved on to position C ; and so on indefinitely . Reaching the position occupied by the tortoise involves that the latter has moved always just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Achilles can never catch his little competitor ! ( One may take this in terms of figures , if one chooses , and it works out just the same : if Achilles runs twice as fast or if the distance between their orginal startingplaces is measured in terms of , say , yards , the tortoise will still always be ahead in terms of the rate assumed , and with that ratio remaining the same , the distance is always decreasing but never arriving at a zero point ? the place where they are together . ) Instead of the flying arrow let us take as an example the crack Pennsylvania train which we board at Wooster and which presumably is to carry us to Chicago , our destination . Now the curious situation is this : the crack-flyer can not conceivably move along a given finite line , Wooster to Chicago ; first , because the train can not start ; secondly , because assuming it did start , it could not continue to move ; and thirdly , it can not arrive at its destination even though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no first position into which it can move since between the starting position and the " first-next " position there are an infinite number of nexts and hence no first-next ; it can not continue to move for the same reason ; and , it can not arrive at Chicago as a terminal since there is no last into which it can move though it move indefinitely . Accordingly , there 's no use to // board the train , since it can not get started and assuming it did start , it could not keep moving nor arrive where we wished to go ! Bertrand Russell gives this account of the second puzzle : Achilles can not reach the tortoise ( under the conditions of the race as given above ) , for at every given moment both Achilles and the tortoise are somewhere and neither is ever twice in the same somewhere while the race is going on . Now , the tortoise goes to as many somewheres as Achilles , since each is in a given somewhere at a given moment and in another somewhere at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tortoise , the latter would have gone only a part of the number of somewheres touched by Achilles , or , to state it conversely , the former would have been in more some-wheres than the latter ; but this is impossible , as each con-testant at any given period has been in the same number of somewheres ! 4 What odd conclusions emerge when Parmeni-dean ideas are applied to the concepts of change , motion , space , and time . Some Solutions of the Paradoxes of Zeno That Zeno succeeded in mystifying his opponents is no secret . His own solution was very simple ; he had set out to show the impossibility of motion , change , time , and space ( as a somewhere into which things could move ) , and he merely asserted with Parmenides that these were all unreal ! And if these are not real , of course there is no problem to be solved ! Such a solution was , however , too easy and costly to be taken without protest by those who followed . To philoso-phers , during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad name , one which deserved contempt and ridicule . For some it was easy to say in answer to such puzzles that thought and logic are tricky and must not be trusted too // far ; and they dismissed the paradoxes as evidences of dis-eased thinking ; for surely change , motion , time , and space are real ! It remained for Henri Bergson to come forth with a vigorous attack , one which has gained a joyous and respect-ful hearing in many philosophical camps . His solution was also very simple : he denied that space , time , motion , and change can be handled in the way Zeno did , i.e. , by cutting them up into infinitesimal points and instants . The arrow-in-motion can not be " cut up " into divisible units ; such a cutting-up process is killing motion . Motion as such is in-divisible . Dividing linear space over which the arrow moves is not dividing the movement ; it is simply dividing a static line . The analogy between a line and movement is a halting one ; it is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . Zeno , moreover , conceived the Achilles-tortoise race in terms of a series of stops or rests much in the same way that the cinematograph film con-sists of a series of rest-pictures . But it is clear , the sum-mation of these snap-pictures by themselves will not give motion ; a moving picture is more than the summation of these independent static pictures ; for the moving picture to be a moving picture these snaps must be set in motion , in an indivisible on-going process . Motion , change , and time must be immediately experienced ; our concepts are by their very nature tricky , in that they , like the cinematograph film , consist of a series of statics and hence remove us from the true nature of such fluid realities . ' It is the claim , however , of the recent mathematical logi-cians that they have finally and completely answered the paradoxes ; and , in a remark of Bertrand Russell , this is one of the greatest achievements of our modern time ! ' Accord-ing to our modern Pythagorean prophet , Zeno 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of motion , viz. , those of the infinitesimal , the infinite , and continuity , each of which has been dealt with in a most satisfactory way by the modern mathematical thinkers , Weierstrass , Dedekind , and Cantor . As everyone knows , what Zeno did with the arrow-inflight , for example , was to cut its linear path into an infinite number of infinitesimals . This seemed legitimate enough . The notion of the infinitesimal has been a respected notion down through the centuries ; for example , a circle has long been regarded as a polygon of many equally small sides infinitesimally conceived . This infinitesimal conception was regarded as favorable to the notion of continuity . But " what is an infinitesimal ? " asks the modern mathematical logician who insists upon clear notions and exact definitions . Indeed , this was an embarrassing question . A vague notion , of course , will not do . It was suggested that an infinitesimal was that which is arrived at , say when a finite line is divided into such small parts that each is smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says the new logician , this very small part which you call the infinitesimal is itself finite . Granted that you may cut up that line infinitely , what you arrive at is still finite . To which the proponent of the infinitesimal replies : well , in the end of this process of infinitely dividing the divisibility will become infinitesimal . To which the logician says : surely not ; for there is no end to such a process ! One can carry on this cutting forever without any last point being ever reached ; however far this cutting process goes on the parts are always of some size , no infinite number of divisions will bring us to infinitesimal points . Thus , says the mathematical logician , the infinitesimal is a disguised statement for a certain class of finites ! With the old notion of the infinitesimal gone , what happens ? In place of an infinitesimal being considered as an indefinably small **33;757;TOOLONG the modTHE // ern mathematician considers it merely as a variable having 0 as its limit . If the old notion is abandoned ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then it follows that Zeno 's infinitesimals which form the basis of his paradoxes must be reinterpreted since they rest upon a false conception of their nature . What Zeno did was to set up as positive units negative notions ; he arbitrarily jumped from infinitely small finites in the process of divisibility of space-lines into otherthan-finites or infinitesimals ; moreover , he treated the infinite series of these infinitesimal absolutes as if it had the character of finites ! This leads at once to a discussion of infinity . Literally , infinity means " without end . " But , says the modern mathematician , this is wrong . Some infinite series have ends as , for example , an infinite number of points in a finite line or an infinite number of past moments culminating in the present or the infinite number of future moments beginning in the present . The concept of infinity accordingly needs exact definition . To the modern mathematician , in general , infinity means simply a variable which increases without limit . Such a variable need not be endless in all directions ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveals that there are certain positive characteristic features about infinite numbers which are lacking in finite numbers . For example , infinite numbers are not countable like finite numbers though they may be known . We may know , for example , something about the character of an infinite collection without being able to enumerate each part ; we may know something about the collection , say of " mankind " without knowing each and every man by knowing about some men who have certain characteristics belonging to that collection . Now there is an infinite number of infinite numbers , a mathematical study of which reveals certain special characteristics . For instance , it was long thought that there could be no infinite number , since its existence involved a contradiction . It can be shown by a simple mathematical demonstration that the whole is no greater than its part . Consider the line A ' ? B ' which is a part of line A ' ? C. For the sake of the demonstration move line A ' ? B ' up ( A ? B as in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and A ' ? C from one common point X. For every point in A ? B ( a , b , c , d , etc. ) there is one Figure and only one point ( a ' , b ' , c ' , d ' , etc. ) in A ' ? C and vice versa . Thus there are as many points in the part as in the whole and thus the whole is " no greater " than the parts ! If each line contained a finite number of parts , this would not be true ; but on the basis of an infinite number it is true . Accordingly , since this involves a contradiction , it was assumed that there is no such thing as an infinite number . Now the modern mathematical logician builds his notion of infinite number upon this very characteristic , viz. , that of a one-to-one correspondence . An infinite number , he says , is such that the part contains as many terms as the whole of which it is a part ; an infinite number is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mathematical notion of continuity . This is bound up with the mathematical concept of infinity . For every point in a straight line , thinks the mathematician , there is a one-to-one correspondence with a given number . Now there is no infinitesimal number ( in the old sense ) to a mathematician ( do you know of any infinitesimal number ? ) . A series , accordingly , consists of an infinite number of numbers no two of which are consecutive , i.e. , no two numbers stand next to each other ( since an infinite number of numbers stands between ) . Now between any finite numbers there are gaps ; but not so between infinite numbers . If we have a series of infinite numbers , there are no gaps but a complete and compact whole . Continuity , then , means that there are no gaps . Motion is transitional in character , involving continuity . At a given finite instant an object in motion is in a given finite place but at an " infinite moment " it is at a given " infinite place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enumeration or singling-out ) involves no beginning nor ending such as characterizes a finite place and a finite instant . Zeno 's flying arrow was considered by him to be at a given finite place at a given finite time . On such a basis Zeno 's paradox rings true . But the arrow-inmotion is in an " infinite place " at an " infinite time , " which makes for quite a different conclusion . This infinity of place and time does not have the character of finite place and time ; it is a compact place and time without gaps , without beginning or ending and hence is in a situation or state of continuity . Let us illustrate in a little more detail ( and , for the sake of simplification of presentation , ignore certain possible and technical objections of the modern mathematician ) the notion of a number-continuum in reference to a given geometrical line . Assuming the continuity of such a line we say that an infinite number of points are contained in it and for every point in that line a corresponding number  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
