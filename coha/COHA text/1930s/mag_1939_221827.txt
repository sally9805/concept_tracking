Soon after Henry Wallace tackled the farm problem in 1933 with AAA , the God of Drought came to his aid . Drought as well as subsidy and legal restriction reduced wheat surpluses , corn surpluses , even cotton surpluses . But three years ago Drought began to withdraw its assistance . This year Drought turned its attention ( selectively ) to the Northeastern States : May was bone dry and July was desert ( until rains came last week ) and both did plenty of damage to truck and fruit crops . But eastern Drought did not reduce the crops that are Mr. Wallace 's big problems . <P> So for a third year in succession he has a major surplus to fight . Last year wheat was the most acute headache , year before it was cotton , this year corn . This week he had to face the music . On August 1 came due the loans of 57 a bushel which he made to farmers who put under seal part of their last year 's crop . <P> Last January Midwestern farmers were hoarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the price was down to 40 , the lowest in six years , and no one wanted any of it . This year 's crop is huge ( estimated 2,550,000,000 bu . ) . Besides , there is an approximated carry-over of 550,000,000 bu . This , added to the new crop , comes to over 3,100,000,000 bu. , 350,000,000 bu. over the five-year average of " normalcy . " <P> If the Secretary finds the crop exceeding the " norm " by 10% , he must assign marketing quotas ( and penalties ) to prevent market flooding , call a vote asking for ? approval by farmers thus quotaed . Such umpiring on Wallace 's part would put him in the usual umpire 's spot . Last year Wallace slid out of calling a vote by estimating consumption and exports high enough to make the supply seem reasonable . <P> With corn at 40 , farmers who had borrowed 57 a bushel on 257,000,000 bu. started to unload about 100,000,000 bu. on Commodity Credit Corp . Hurriedly Secretary Wallace bought steel bins to hold 50,000,000 bu. , hoped this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Secretary 's trouble is that most of it comes of his having struggled so long with the farm problem . Former farm editor , mathematician , agriobiologist , he spent 15 years before becoming Secretary of Agriculture in developing hybrid seed corn ( through Pioneer Hi-Bred Seed Co. , originally the Wallace family 's ) , which increases yields 10 to 20% . In corn-growing Iowa , 79% of this year 's acreage was planted with yield-increasing seed . Lately Henry Wallace on his daily walk to his office in Washington has taken to stopping in Washington Monument grounds to practice with a boomerang for exercise . But he never threw a better boomerang than his own hybrid seed , whose production economies and improved yield are no consolation to hopelessly overcapacitated corn farmers . <P> Wheat and cotton are cash crops . Not so , corn . Nearly nine out of ten bushels are used to feed hogs and livestock . The lower the price , the more feed for hogs ; the more hogs , the lower the price of pork . With corn at 40 there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pig crop reaches 80,000,000 little grunters , pigs and pork prices will nosedive , and Washington will have still another quota on its hands .
