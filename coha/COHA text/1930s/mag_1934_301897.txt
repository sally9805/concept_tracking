Five conductors will have gone to bat with the New York Philharmonic-Symphony before great Arturo Toscanini returns late in January . Otto Klemperer , Hans Lange and Werner Janssen have had their turns . Bruno Walter 's begins next week . Last week 's Philharmonic guest was Artur Rodzinski , popular conductor of the Cleveland Orchestra . <P> Conductor Rodzinski 's dbut concert was the loudest if not the loveliest that New Yorkers have heard this season . He swayed excitedly from side to side , made fierce faces at the players to bring out every last theatric effect . Scriabin 's Divine Poem , stunningly bombastic , compelled an ovation for the hard-working Clevelander . But Rodzinski had still louder music : two entr'actes from Soviet Composer Dmitri Shostakovich 's Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk . <P> Great curiosity awaits the Shostakovich opera which will be given this winter in three U. S. cities. * Soviets regard the 28-year-old composer as their ablest musicmaker . His murderous heroine is really a lovable young woman driven to her crimes by incompatible bourgeois surroundings . One sample played last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macbeth ) murders her father-in-law . The second describes two drunken moujiks as they discover her husband 's body hidden in a cellar . When audiences can see the spooky doings on the stage they may be impressed by the Shostakovich screeching . But the orchestra bits played last week left an impression of dressed-up bogeymen too noisy to be terrifying . <P> *The Cleveland Orchestra will give the first performance in Cleveland Jan. 31 , repeat it in Manhattan , Feb. 5 , sponsored by the League of Composers . The Philadelphia premire will be given by the Philadelphia Orchestra March 15.
