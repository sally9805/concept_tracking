When gentle old President Paul Doumer of France was shot and killed by crazed Dr. Paul Gorgulov ( TIME , May 16 ) , the Russian assassin 's 82-year-old mother performed a striking service to the Soviet State . She testified that her son was a " White Russian , " not a " Red Russian " as the Paris Press was screaming. * <P> Later 82-year-old Mother Gorgulov was arrested for stealing grain . She pleaded that she was almost starving . Her case dropped out of the Soviet Press . Last week letters received in Warsaw declared that Mother Gorgulov had been " executed as a grain thief . " <P> * Dr. Gorgulov insisted that he was a " Green Russian , " founder of the " Green Fascist Party " ( non-existent ) . In jail he expressed a desire to found the " Green Religion , " asked for a green robe , green sheets and green vegetables , was granted only the vegetables .                   @ @
