Good Roman Catholics live and die by seven sacraments , which they believe were instituted by Jesus Christ . The nature of these sacraments is such that they span the full life of man , but few men could lead full enough lives to receive all seven during a lifetime . Last week , however , the news service of the National Catholic Welfare Conference ( U. S. hierarchical agency ) discovered a man who had-the Abb Andr Durupt , chaplain of a soldiers ' home at Lunville , France . <P> Like all good Catholics he received the sacrament of baptism in infancy , that of confirmation in youth , those of the Eucharist and penance frequently thereafter . Before serving in the World War Andre Durupt received the sacrament of matrimony . During the War he was so badly wounded that he was given extreme unction . After the War his wife died ; he studied for the priesthood , took the sacrament of holy orders .                    @
