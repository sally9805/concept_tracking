Last week Radiopriest Charles E. Coughlin was addressing a state rally of his National Union for Social Justice at Detroit 's Fair Grounds . One listener not a member of the National Union was Frank ( " Woody " ) Hockaday , onetime Wichita , Kans. automobile accessories dealer , now chiefly interested in promoting peace by means of sudden dramatic appearances with a bag of feathers . This punchinello of the 1936 political campaign first received public notice and fell into the hands of the police in June when , attired in red shorts and an Indian war bonnet , he strewed his feathers all over Philadelphia 's Broad Street to impress convening Democrats with his slogan : " Feathers Instead of Bullets . " Half-naked Mr. Hockaday next burst into the Washington office of Acting Secretary of War Woodring , where he dumped 40 Ib. of feathers to discourage warfare . When this lively eccentric tried the same thing at the Maryland State American Legion Convention at Baltimore last August , the Legionaries gave him an unmerciful beating . Since then peace-loving Woody Hockaday had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resplendent in a costume consisting of a red coat , white pants and a white cap , this amazingly ubiquitous character climbed unnoticed onto the speakers ' platform at Detroit . As Radiorator Coughlin was loudly explaining the difference between Communism and Christianity , nimble Woody Hockaday showered him with feathers , deftly sidestepped a punch the priest aimed at him , shouted into the microphone : " You ca n't mix religion and politics ! " While Peaceman Hockaday was being hauled off to a cell , Father Coughlin regained his composure , continued his address , feathers fluttering with every gesture .
