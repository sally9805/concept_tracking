Manhattan 's Theatre Arts Committee , composed of such Broadwayites as Robert Benchley , Jed Harris , Lillian Hellman , Marc Blitzstein , Orson Welles , is not friendly to fascism . On three fronts- theatre , cinema , radio-it has been making anti-fascist lunges for all it is worth . The committee 's latest enterprise is TAC , a midnight cabaret presented on Mondays at Manhattan 's weatherbeaten Chez Firehouse . In a free- &-easy; atmosphere of cigarets and drinks , audiences can watch a revue modeled after Pins and Needles and possessing much of its muscular merit . <P> With Mercury Theatre Actor Hiram Sherman as jovial master of ceremonies , TAC includes : <P> Mighty Sages of the Feature Pages , fast satiric patter by three impersonators of Westbrook Pegler , Walter Lippmann , Boake Carter . <P> Mittens , a hobbledehoy take-off on the Federal Theatre 's Living Newspaper. * <P> German Exile Lotte Goslar 's funny and grotesque pantomimic dances . <P> A final Ja , das ist ein Schnitzelbank number , with the audience joining in and yelling its head off over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Folk , Serene Impunity , Chinese Unity , etc . <P> <P> *Incorporated this week into Pins and Needles under the tile . . .
