Some scientific discoveries are made because they were theoretically predicted and diligently looked for . Such was the discovery of the planet Pluto whose existence and probable orbit were indicated by irregularities in the orbits of other planets . So , too , deuterium ( heavy hydrogen ) was identified because its discoverer already had intimations of its existence , and the positive electron was foreshadowed in the cogitations of at least one mathematician before its track turned up in the laboratory . In fact , some things are made use of even before they are discovered - e.g. , the little uncharged particle called the neutrino which atomic physicists need in their calculations but which has never yet come to light experimentally . Quite different are unexpected and sometimes unwelcome discoveries* which do not fit into any preconceived picture and further complicate the problems with which scientists struggle . Such a thing is a new particle of matter , which as yet has no name except " X-particle . " <P> Physicists probing within the atom toward the ultimate constitution of matter already had their hands full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , protons ( nuclei of hydrogen atoms ) , deuterons ( nuclei of doubleweight hydrogen ) , tritons ( nuclei of tripleweight hydrogen ) , alpha particles ( nuclei of helium ) , and the theoretical but necessary neutrino ( little neutron ) . <P> But now Carl David Anderson of California Institute of Technology and Jabez Curry Street of Harvard are positively convinced that the X-particle exists , and last week Dr. Street raised the unwelcome particle to a status where it can not possibly be laughed off : he announced that he had approximately measured its mass . <P> Boyish , modest Dr. Anderson discovered the positive electron in 1932 and is now a Nobel Prizeman . In 1934 , in an inconspicuous footnote , he hinted at the possible existence of a new particle . The dilemma which confronted him then was a choice between theory and observation . He was studying electrons which occur in cosmic rays . Such electrons are supposed to behave according to the Bethe-Heitler theory , which ascribes certain penetrating powers to electrons of certain velocities . Dr. Anderson 's data showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Above that energy level there appeared to be an unorthodox particle of great penetrating power . If this was an electron , the Bethe-Heitler theory broke down at high energies ; if the theory was valid the particle was something heavier than an electron .
