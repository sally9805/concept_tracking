Sarah Lawrence College was released three years ago from the protective custody of Vassar 's President Henry Noble McCracken ( TIME , Dec. 21 , 1936 ) , its eight-year-old feet set firmly on the path of progressive education . Ever since then , the college has wanted to record in film a " sustained visual explanation " of itself . Last week the wish was fact . <P> Shown for the first time to the student body , Design for Education chronicles the Sarah Lawrence educational method typified in the four-year career of a candidate for an A.B . degree . " Joan , " the heroine , is Marjory Erdman , a sophomore from Honolulu , who was allowed to count her cinemacting as school work .

Generally the girls can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polo coat and smudged saddle shoes , as Joan is , but they can also afford expensive outfits . Sarah Lawrence has climbed high in women 's education , has earned the reputation of being among the best of women 's progressive colleges. * It also has the reputation , which the faculty deprecates , of being a finishing school for the rich and fashionable . <P> <P> * Other progressive girls ' college : Bennington.
