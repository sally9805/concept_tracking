In the paneled palace where John Lewis has his Washington headquarters , the heads of 43 C. I. O. unions assembled last week to appraise their past , plan their future . <P> One of the first to arrive for the first meeting of the recently established C. I. O. executive board was President Lewis himself , looking hot and tired in summer whites . " Hi , Jim , how are you , boy ? " he greeted boyish , diffident James Barton Carey , secretary of C. I. 0 . and president of its electrical union . Vice President Philip Murray was gravely on his dignity , as becomes a crown prince . Bronzed with a Florida tan , recovered from pneumonia , Vice President Sidney Hillman backslapped one &; all . Mooning about like a bitter rabbit was little Alien Harry Bridges , whose services to C. I. O. on the West Coast may be terminated by deportation proceedings next week . <P> C. I. O. in 1940 is an imponderable which Mr. Lewis declines to define so long as an implied third-party threat may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> That any Democratic candidate ( including Franklin Roosevelt ) would automatically qualify for C. I. O. support , regardless of what the President does or allows to be done to Labor meanwhile , John Lewis has significantly failed to say . Last week he said : " . . . The nation is still in crisis . <P> Economically we now stand little ahead of where we stood four years ago . ... I do not think the people will ... be content with timid solutions offered by government , solutions fearfully withdrawn before they can be really tested . Unless the nation is led unhesitatingly and courageously forward ... we stand in danger of ... <P> despair . . . black reaction . . . Fascism . " <P> If the recent upsurge of anti-union legislation in California , Oregon , Wisconsin , Minnesota , Pennsylvania , Michigan taught John Lewis anything , it was that Labor was not uniformly popular in all sections of the country even with vote-hungry politicians , and that Labor had better bestir itself politically . Leader Lewis now talked of forming " articulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and economic affairs , " and belligerently proclaimed : " Progressive Labor is not retreating . " On his recommendation , his board proceeded to woo Youth and Farmers , tease the Aged by recommending $60-a-month Federal pensions for single oldsters over 60 , $90 a month for married couples . <P> Impossible Peace . John Lewis has never agreed with Franklin Roosevelt that C. I. O.-A . F. of L. reunion per se is a good &; necessary thing for Labor . He had his tongue firmly in cheek when he was pushed into renewing peace talks last February , stuck it in further when he noted in Franklin Roosevelt 's " invitation " a scarcely veiled threat to impose peace if none could be found by negotiation . Four weeks after the negotiations bogged down , John Lewis last week announced : " Peace , as such , is a secondary consideration to the organization of non-union workers . . . The A. F. of L. is still in control of a small group of leaders firmly entrenched , reactionary in their attitude on public affairs , tolerant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The C. I. O. board is unanimously convinced that the A. F. of L. is following a ' rule or ruin ' policy . . . . " <P> A reporter asked : " Is peace impossible ? "
