txt Harry Bridges admitted freely today at the hearing on his deportation that the unions which he represents had sought and accepted the support of the Communist party . He also stated that he was not and never had been a member of that party although twenty years ago he was in the I. W. W. a short time until he found out what it stood for . Bridges testified before Dean James M. Landis , trial examiner , in a crowded court room at the Immigration Station on Angel Island , and among the spectators were Dr. Alexander Meiklejohn , Donald Ogden Stewart and Mrs. Stewart , and Mrs. Stewart 's son , Peter Steffens , whose father was Lincoln Steffens . Although Bridges testified to accepting Communist support in matters of interest to trade unions he asserted that the Communist party could never take over the unions with which he is connected . He denied he had stated that the Longshoremen and Warehousemen Union had the Communist party to thank for what it had gained . " It would be foolish to make such a statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got them the things they have gotten and they take credit themselves . " For More Government Ownership Before a tense audience , Bridges , who showed the nervous strain of the proceedings , stated his belief that " we could have a lot more municipal or government ownership than we have now , and we could n't do a much worse job with the means of production than private industry has been able to do . " I am for a greater degree of government ownership than we have now ; very definitely , " he added . As to whether he favored entire ownership of the means of production he replied : " I really do n't know . " Dean Landis watched Bridges intently from a short distance and occasionally interrupted with questions directed at clarifying the point of view . There was a dramatic moment at the beginning of the session when the C. I. 0 . leader and the examiner , both on the line of forty , stood side by side while Dean Landis administered the ' oath . Admits Aid From Communists Bridges throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unions which he represents had accepted support from Communists , Democrats and Republicans . He stated his belief in the democratic form of government , which he defined as " a rule by the majority and in the interests of the majority . " But when he was asked " Do you believe in a capitalistic form of government ? " he replied : " If you mean the capitalistic form of society , which , to me , means the exploitation of a lot of people for a profit , and a complete disregard of their interests for that profit , I have n't much use for it . " He also stated that he had never seen Communists practice force and had no way of knowing whether they would , but " if they did I would be opposed to it . " Dean Landis , his profile to the hearing room as he faced the wit ? ness , concentrated as intensely as Bridges , who answered the cities . lions of the government counsel , Thomas B. Shoemaker , with alternate deliberation and quick-flowing responses . Accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had evsv told any one that he was a mert+ber of the Communist party , Bricip:s replied that he had " kidded people at times because it got to be such a joke on occasions , but soberly and officially I never have , or seriously I never have . " " How would you kid them ? " Mr. Shoemaker continued . " Well , I would say the matter of communism and the Red scare has at times reached the point , especially on the waterfront , where it became a standing joke among the union members . For example , we had one convention in Los Angeles in 1936 where everybody that walked into the convention , including what we might term the reactionary groups as well as the progressive groups , everybody that walked Into the convention gave the Communist salute at the door as a lot of fun . Every time that anybody stood up to address the chairman he would say ' Commissar Chairman , I want the floor . ' " Mr. Shoemaker wanted to know if Bridges had ever had occasion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , " was the reply . " On many occasions I have been asked to deny it and sometimes I have refused , depending on the circumstances . Other times I have denied it , We have found in our trade union affairs , especially on the waterfront where the question of communism and red herring has been used and has always been used to divide our unions , to lay a smoke screen down under the cover of which a lot of anti-union activities can be carried on , we have found it necessary in our trade unions to pass rules prohibiting red-baiting . " Therefore in our meetings it is distinctly out of order for anybody to ask if anybody is a Communist as a prerequisite of him getting the floor or on any other occasion . " Now on those occasions naturally if I am asked , ' Are you a Communist ? ' the question is ignored . At certain open forums where I believe the question is asked from a sincere desire to get the information , the question is answered . " Asked whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or detrimental to the labor movement as a whole , Bridges replied : ? I have known of instances where I believe that if it was carried to the logical conclusion I think it would be detrimental . I know of others where it has been distinctly beneficial . You have to break it down . I think that the good the Communist party does , if they have any influence over trade unions , which they do n't have over ours , would outweigh the bad things the other way . " 3iridges said he would never attempt to say " that I know about the ultimate aims of the Communist party . " He replied with a flat " no " when asked if he believed the employing class could be eliminated by means of the ballot , and in the course of a long statement added : " If we are sincere ? and honest in regard to supporting the democratic form of government , we will fight just as hard against the elimination of those people we do n't like as for the people we do like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be better than a democratic set-up ? " he was asked . " Not to my knowledge ; there is none , " Bridges replied . Regarding an expression that he had no love for employers , he added : " The evils that I have run into and all the misery I have run into h-ve generally sprung from that group , and the things that they have attemptea t ' put over . When I say ' employers ' I mean the industrial corporate interests . " Questioned by Dean Landis , Bridges said that while small employers have a realization of other people 's troubles besides their own , he had never found this in any association of large industrial owners or bankers . Legion Leaders " Anti-Labor " Bridges characterized the ranking officers of the American Legion as anti-labor , in many cases favoring Fascist policies . Mr. Shoemaker at the afternoon session asked Bridges if he recalled having stated at a meeting of the International Longshoremen and Warehousemen 's Union that the union had the Communist party to thank for what it had gained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would b ' foolish to make such a statement . You can not fool our people that easy . They know who got them the things they have gotten , and they take credit , themselves . It is quite possible I have made a statement that we have received assistance in certain situations from the Communist party , and every one of our members knows that . But no ' that we have them to thank for everything we have got . That is untrue . " " Would it be to the extent that perhaps you might not have gained it had it not been for the Communist party ? " " That would n't he true either . " Mr. Shoemaker then asked : " Did you ever feel there was any noticeable influence on the part of the Communist party in determining policies of any of the maritime unions ? " " That would be impossible , and I never have felt it , " said Bridges . " It is impossible for the Communist party to influence our unions . " Asked if union members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied : " They certainly would if there was anything in it for them . " " Have you ever done that ? " " I certainly , " Bridges responded . In the elections of 1936 , he added , and again last November there was a united front . They sought in November to defeat what was known as Proposition No. 1 , " which we were definitely afraid of and which we were definitely sure was a measure to eliminate trade unions , " he said . In response to a question as to whether he believed that the employing class could be eliminated by means of the ballot , Bridges replied : " I do n't think you will eliminate them by means of the ballot , or possibly in any other way , except you poison them , or something . " The statement was apparently not intended to be taken literally . Bridges added here his statement about fighting for people " we do n't like " as hard as for the " people we do like . " Motion to Move Hearing Denied Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Landis denied the defense motion to remove the hearing from Angel Island to San Francisco . The defense had urged that the purpose of obtaining an open trial for Bridges could be accomplished better in San Francisco . The disposition of this motion had given him such concern , he said , that he believed it necessary to state the reasons for his action . In a long statement Dean Landis said : " As a matter of strict law no right even to any kind of an open hearing attaches to proceedings of this nature . Deportation has been held by the courts again and again to be a civil proceeding to which the requirements of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States , calling for an open trial , do not apply . Furthermore , the practice of the Department of Labor , as I have been advised , has uniformly been against admitting other than the parties and their counsel to hearings of this nature . " But I do not choose to rest my decision upon considerations relating merely to power , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim of right . " Indeed the seriousness of the consequences of deportation to the alien involved , despite the fact that the proceeding is regarded as technically civil in character , leads me to the conclusion that those constitutional standards of fairness in criminal administration set forth in the Sixth Amendment should have application by analogy to proceedings of this character . " Press and Groups Admitted Dean Landis went on to stress the requirement that admission should be by pass only , and added : " These passes have been given to every representative of the public press that to my knowledge has applied . They have also been given out to representatives of organizations who have a direct or indirect interest in the proceedings , such as the American Civil Liberties Union , the Bridges Defense Committee , the King Defense Committee , the International Labor Defense . " Others , whose desire to attend the hearings has arisen from little more than a legitimate and praiseworthy interest in public affairs , have also been granted passes to attend . have denied , I believe , only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time valid . " Referring to threats to which witnesses had testified , " and one claim of intimidation of a witness here in this room , " Dean Landis said there seemed to him sufficient foundation to believe that there was possibility of reprisals being yisited on some accuser , whether that accusation be made in attack on or in defense of Bridges . He added that the chances of averting such an incident seemed better if the proceeding should continue on Angel Island .
