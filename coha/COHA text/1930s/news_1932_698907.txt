txt Debts of Southern States . To the Editor of The icy , York . Times : The letter of Wilbur Bates published in THE Naw YORK TIMES of July 4 is striking . Anent the repudiated debts of certain Southern States ho writes : " The British put up money to assist the Confederacy to disrupt the United States , while the United States loaned the British Government money to save it from defeat by Germany . " Mr. Bates is quite correct in saying that the United States is not bound to repay money loaned to disrupt our country , and I am anxious to bring that argument before some of my British acquaintances . To make the case stronger , I would like facts and figures . Therefore , I would like to ask Mr. Bates through your columns if he will supply the data to back up his glorious Fourth of July case . When were these loans made and when were they repudiated ? MICHAEL . New York , July 5 , 1932 ,          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
