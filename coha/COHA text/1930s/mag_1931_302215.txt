The Man Who Came Back ( Fox ) . <P> After a seven-month separation while the Fox publicity department astutely built up popular demand for their reappearance together , Charles Farrell and Janet Gaynor are brought together again in this rewrite of a stagey , old-fashioned melodrama . He is a rich man 's wastrel son . She is a cabaret entertainer who is about to make a man of him , when they are separated . When they meet again she has become a drug addict and he is in the act of trading his fraternity ring for a bottle of booze . In a whirl of misty sentiment they work out each other 's salvation . In addition to other faults there is far too much talk in the picture and both principals are ludicrously miscast . These are the most serious roles Farrell &; Gaynor have ever tried . The results should prove to anyone 's satisfaction that the only thing they can do on the screen is what they made their reputation for-poetic comedy-dramas of young love . Most gratifying shot : exposure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's rich father . <P> <P> After seeing her in High Society Blues , Janet Gaynor 's husband , Lydell Peck , San Francisco lawyer , advised her to accept no more such roles , told her the best way to make the Fox company feel her value was to leave them for a while . Though rumored to be quarreling with Peck , Janet Gaynor quarreled with Fox . She and her mother got on a boat for Honolulu . On the boat by accident she met Farrell , whom the public believed to have been Husband Peck 's rival before her marriage . Afraid of scandal , Farrell took his bags , got off the boat . Janet Gaynor stayed away from the Fox studio until she had lost $44,000 in salary . She came back because she was afraid if she remained rebellious all the studios would boycott her . This is her first picture since making peace with her employers . <P> <P> The Right to Love ( Paramount ) .

Ruth Chatterton at 18 and Ruth Chatterton at 45 not only chat in the same room but walk past each other , in defiance of the old law of double exposure . Another new technical departure is a device which , more effectively than any other tried heretofore , eliminates " ground noise , " i. e. the scratch and hum of projection machinery . The dialog is thrown into high relief , not always to the advantage of the picture . It is a story about a woman of the farmlands who , when her lover is killed in a reaping machine , marries an unattractive neighbor to father her child . The illegitimate daughter , when she hears the story , rebels against her mother , forswears love , goes to China to do mission work . At the end she runs away from the mission school with Paul Lukas . As both mother and daughter Ruth Chatterton is skilfully but unconvincingly theatrical .
