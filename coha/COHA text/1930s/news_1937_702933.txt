txt The ear of an automobile driver is quicker than his eye In responding to a safety warning . An auto horn , or a policeman 's whistle , puts the driver 's foot on the brake faster than the sight of a red light . These findings in safe driving were announced today at Indiana university . The tests were made by Dr. Frank R. Elliott and Prof. C. M. Louttit of the psychology department . Seven hundred drivers were tested . Each one sat in the driver 's seat , with one foot pressing the accelerator half way to the floor . The time required to lift this foot to the brake and press the pedal all the way down was taken . The signal to put on the brake was either a red light directly In front , or an automobile horn . The signals were given with the car standing still . All groups , whether men or women , young or old , responded more quickly to the horn than to the light . The average advantage of the ear over the eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , the fastest braking time for the red light was three-tenths of a second ; the quickest for the horn a little more than two-fifths of a second . Persons with the higher mental ratings were quicker than any other class . The best driver in terms of speed of braking time was the young man in early twenties and of high mental rating . In general , it appeared that the average driver can be relied upon to have his brakes on half a second after a warning . Professional drivers did better than half a second .
