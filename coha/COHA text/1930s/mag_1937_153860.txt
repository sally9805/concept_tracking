Meatier reading than for several years is the Soviet Union 's censored press today . Reason : more than 2,000,000 brand new elective jobs have been created by Russia 's new Constitution ( TIME , June 15 , 1936 et seq. ) , and numberless Soviet problems , some acute , are cropping up in print as efforts are made to have these 2,000,000 jobs filled by nation-wide voting on December 12 . <P> Each of the 100,000,000 Russians expected to go to the polls will vote for at least five persons , his representatives at the various levels of the new Constitution 's hierarchy of Soviets . He will vote for his representative : 1 ) in the village , city or metropolitan borough Soviet ; 2 ) in the Soviet of the region ; 3 ) in the Soviet of the Province ; 4 ) in the Soviet of the " area , " such as Khakassk , or the " republic , " such as Georgia , in which he lives ; 5 ) in the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union . <P> At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be personally known to a majority of the electors . At higher stages the reputation of the candidate is increasingly if not entirely his press , radio and cinema reputation . In the Soviet Union the press , the radio and the cinema are 100% controlled by the Soviet State and the Communist Party . No other party is permitted to exist . There is no opposition press . The new Constitution for the first time makes the vote of a peasant equal the vote of a townsman . No one may be nominated except at a meeting , the minutes of which must be signed by all the presiding officers and who will put his name to a paper which the Secret Police , after the election , could construe as evidence of a plot to nominate a " wrecker " ? Latest dispatches indicated that nominating procedure , although the election is to be by secret ballot , has generally thus far been at open sessions with Communists present , vigilant to see and report who moves to nominate whom and what reasons are given by each participant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " electoral commissions , " all appointed on approval from above and ultimately responsible to the Stalin State , each empowered to examine and validate or reject nominations . <P> Thus there seemed no reason to suppose last week that any candidate could be nominated , much less elected , unless he or she is openly and zealously for the Party and the State of Stalin , except in distant or rural communities where , from the point of view of Moscow , the whole political apparatus may have " got into the wrong hands " - say those of the pious . <P> Article 56 . Now that 20 years have rolled over the Russian Revolution-a full generation during which the Soviet Union has been governed by leaders not one of whom openly believes in God or is a professing Christian-the problem of religion seemed until recently to Soviet editors to have all but vanished , has suddenly cropped up again because Article 56 of the new Election Law says : <P> " The right to nominate candidates to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union belongs to all public organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Article 141 of the Constitution-that is to say , to the organizations of the Communist Party , to occupational unions , co-operative societies , youth organizations , cultural societies and other legally registered societies .
