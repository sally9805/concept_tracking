MILLBROOKTo our amazed delight Clara took us next to the barbershop . " I got to go in here , " she said nonchalantly , walking with brazen confidence to the door , " to see about a shaving mug for William . I ' m going to get him one for Christmas . " We hung back . In our most curious moments we had never dreamed of entering the barbershop . Women never went into the barbershop . It was a rendezvous for men  --  sacred to their masculine needs . " Come on , " said Clara . " I wo n't be but a minute . It ' s cold outside . " It was cold outside , a bleak wind blowing and drops of chilly rain . And Clara was confident . She reeked of confidence . She walked as if barbershopswere to her an eminent domain . We entered . " Hello , " she said cheerfully to the barber , who stood , professionally , behind the red plush chair . And , " Oh , " she added as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above its shoulder , " howdy do , Dr. Babcock ? I did n't think there ' d be anybody in this time of day . " Dr. Babcock glared balefully at Clara , disapprovinglyat Cory and me . " I , " he said with cold dignity , which ill becameMILLBROOK 41his lathered face , " was n't expecting ladies , " and dropped to the shelter of his chair . Clara laughed . " I wo n't be a minute , " she said pleasantly . " I just want to order a shaving mug for William for Christmas . I thought I ' d like to look over what you got . " The barber waved toward a cupboard of small cubicles on the wall . " Help yourself , " he said with an apprehensive eye upon the window . " The man ' s coming to-morrow . You pick out any kind you want and I ' 11 order it . " Here were the individual mugs belonging to many of the Millbrook men . A man came from St. Louis to get the orders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Hod Saunders was a baseball player and belonged to the Millbrook Mules . His cup not only had his name lettered in Old English with gold bands and handle , but was embellished by the proper symbol  --  a baseball bat also splendid in gold . Ed Calkins 's bore a mortar and pestle , insignia of his profession ; Les ' Myers 's cup had a pair of horseshoes on it . Clara chose a design floral in nature with William'sname entwined . The letters were to be very large , very gold . The barber wrote the order down . Clara said she would pay for it when it came . The barber said it took them quite a while42 MILLBROOKto decorate the mugs , and that she could have William 's picture on it if she wanted . While Clara was waiting for the barber to wash the lather off Dr. Babcock 's face she picked up a pink picture paper from a pile on a chair and looked at it . She showed a picture to us . It was of a very plump lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like black underclothes , high-heeled shoes , and a little round hat pulled rakishly down in front . That was the first time I ever saw the Police Gazette . And that was the only time I ever saw a woman in the barbershop in Millbrook . We stopped at Lyde Peters 's notion store and while Clara , Lyde , and Nell chattered and giggled and Clara bought a spool of thread , Cory and I glanced anxiously at each other and wished we were at home . As we approached the drugstore the lamps behind the big green and red glass urns in the window had been lighted and Freda was behind the counter . So was Ed , we afterwards learned  --  lying flat on the floor . Often on Saturday nights the men had to come and carry him home . Freda looked worried and had little to say . We did not even stay to wind the music box . " Where in the world , " exclaimed Adelaide anxiouslyas we trailed Clara into the kitchen , redolentMILLBROOK 43of supper , " have you been ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I thought you ' s lost . " Clara tossed her head and laughed , showing her strong white teeth . " We been to Elviry 's , " she said airily , " and we stopped for Gran'ma 's tea . " She did not mention the barbershop , then or later . But my father did . Dr. Babcock thought it wise to inform him of what he considered an outlandish performance . " What in Tunket , " he demanded , " you chasin ' around town with that she-lummox for ? And , " his voice rose and thundered , " what in Tophet you doin ' in the barbershop ? " The matter was dropped , but Cory and I philanderedno more along Main Street . IIIAUNT HANNER 'S SURPRISETHE Aunts Hanner and Sophrony invited us to their home for our first Thanksgiving dinner in Millbrook . They said , just moving in and all , my mother would n't want to get up a big dinner . And anyway , Aunt Hanner said , " You did n't raise any turkeys this year  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ' ve already bought some , " my father announced unexpectedly . " I bought ' em off Lew Becker . I ' m going to bring ' em home to-morrow to fat ' em up . " " Well , " said Aunt Hanner , closing the matter , " you can keep ' em for Christmas . " But the matter was not closed so far as my father was concerned . He was very fond of his sister Hanner , but he was also fond of his food and he had little faith in Aunt Hanner 's culinary skill . She was too much given to experimentation . Aunt Sophrony made no pretense at housewifery . She was the needlewoman : her pieced quilts and knitted counterpanes were a matter of almost nationalMILLBROOK 45pride , and had taken First Prize at the State and County Fairs as long as anyone could remember . A commendable and praiseworthy as well as womanly occupation in my father 's opinion , but this crazy notionthat Hanner could improve upon good cooking was reprehensible , wasteful , and unreliable . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man set down to a table with any surety of satisfaction if a woman was going to try something new on him every time she got up a meal ? Once you found out how a thing ought to be cooked the way a man liked it , what in Old Grimes 's name was the sense of trying to do something else with it ? There was , for instance , but one honorable disposalof punkin and that was in pie  --  freshly cooked , redolent of cinnamon , ginger , milk and eggs , its golden hue but little darkened by a glob of molasses from New Orleens and further honied with brown sugar not too remote from the cane . When , therefore , Aunt Hanner took it into her head to prolong the usefulness of this fruit of autumn fields by drying it , my father , to speak in modern parlance , hit the roof . What in Tunket ' d she want to fool with a thing like that for , he demanded of my mother , to whom Aunt Hanner had sent a generous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after fresh pumpkin was gone . " Looks , " he observed46 MILLBROOKcritically , fingering it with disdain , " like a dried-up toadstool , and tastes " ( sampling it gingerly ) " no better . What ' s she do it for ? " Patiently my mother explained that Aunt Hanner 's idea was to provide further variety to the diet . My father snorted . " Huh ! " he exploded . " Always tryin ' to improve on the Almighty ! If He ' d a wanted punkins to last longer , He ' d a made ' em to last longer . Throw the dum stuff out . " He was never reconciled to tampering with food that was plenty good enough the way his mother had always cooked it . And since his mother was also Aunt Harmer 's , the inference was that Aunt Hanner was wanting in filial reverence . " Ca n't see where she ever got that crazy streak , " he worried . " Not from her fambly , she did n't . Must of got it off that gamblin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the questionable source from which Aunt Hanner 's property had sprung were seldom alluded to in our family except when my father was exasperated beyondendurance . Then he spoke hotly of her now long deceased but still glamorous spouse as " that gamblin ' puppy . " And nothing aroused such exasperationas any interference with his own ideas of properly prepared food . " She ' 11 poison somebody some day , " he prophesieddarkly . " See if she do n't . " MILLBROOK 47But Aunt Hanner never poisoned anyone , and she got more titillating excitement out of her kitchen and the garden plot behind her house than most farmers did out of all their acres . She grew salsify , which she called " oyster plant , " long before any of the market gardeners made its acquaintance , and she planted a row of yellow raspberries which , my father declared , were a freak , like a black sheep or a white crow . She grew small yellow tomatoes while my father was still contending against the red variety , mainly because of the questionable name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okra and parsley and other of what my father called " tarnation useless truck . " She worked in her garden as my father did in his , while the cobwebs were yet white with dew , and she walked in it in the evening alone with God . When it fruited she preciously laid away its surplus stores with knowing hands , and in winter she brought them out for the delectation of her family and friends . Aunt Hanner loved food  --  food from seed to fruition  --  and found no greater satisfaction on earth than in speculating with its possibilities . But she stood no higher in my father 's estimation for all her inventive measures . To be obliged even to consider anything other than the traditional Thanksgiving turkey and cranberries , mashed potatoes and giblet sauce , squash , boiled48 MILLBROOKonions , and either mince or pumpkin pie would have been an insult not only to his stomach but to his sense of fitness . " Ca n't tell what that contrary-minded old fool Hanner ' 11 be up to , " he grumbled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of a newspaper ' s anything . " My mother tried to reassure him . " She would n't , " she argued ,  --  but without conviction ,  --  " fix up anything for Thanksgiving  --  she ' s got more sense than that . " " She ai n't got no sense at all , " my father gloomily forbode , " when it comes to vittles . You ' d think she ' s brought up in a glue factory ! " Conviction bore in upon him until he finally balked . He said he would n't go . He ' d been hornswoggled into eating potatoes messed up with fodder ( meaning parsley ) and soup made out of God knows what , certainly anything but a shank bone the way it was meant to be made , and there ought to be a law against newspapers and magazines printing receipts . And anyway he ' d stood all he was going to of Hanner 's tomfoolery and he was n't going . Of course he went . My mother had ways  --  mostly along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knuckles or some other favorite dish  --  of bringing him around ; and so , after a ratherMILLBROOK 49concentrated assault upon his palate , and by an equally determined silence regarding the proposed visit , he was led to the fateful eve . No preparations for the festal day had been made in our own kitchen , a fact which provoked his frequentinvestigation . Early in the week he had asked what day my mother wanted the turkey killed . She looked at him with wide and apparently innocent eyes . " Turkey ? " she repeated stupidly . " What tur-key ? " " Well , " my father replied techily , " we usually have a turkey on Thanksgiving , do n't we ? I been fattening two of them I bought off of Lew Becker . " " Oh . " The surprise of her life colored my mother 's tones . " Thanksgiving ? I thought we ' s going to Harmer 's . I told her we would , of course . " Bowed and beaten , he betook his morose way to the barn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen , laid out a clean shirt and his best clothes . In the morning , wearing the aspect of one foredoomed , he put them on and hitched up the horse to the pung , for though it was but a short distance to the Aunts ' home , snow had fallen in the night over rough frozen mud , and still fell , and the walking would be disagreeable . He loaded us in , 50 MILLBROOKcloaked , hooded , mittened , with flannel petticoats underneath and ar'tics on our feet . My father , according to his usual impatient custom , was ready long before time to go . In fact , Aunt Hanner had been rather explicit about having dinner at one o'clock , but expressed no desire for our companyat an earlier hour . My mother , herself nursing secret apprehension , found countless tasks that had to be finished before she could go . Hens must be given a dish of warm corn-meal mash with a little red pepper in it . She suggested an extra ration of shelled corn in case we should be late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be late for ? What in thunder you think I ' d do settin ' around that cluttered-up place after we 've et ? Le ' s get started so we can get home . " ) Nevertheless , she managed to stall our departure , so that we arrived just as the finishing touches were being laid to the table . My father , coming from stabling his horse , audibly sniffed . He hung his snowy overcoat and hat on a hook behind the kitchen door , greeted his sisters glumly , and took up a position of advantage near the stove . Aunt Sophrony wore a look of nervous apprehensionunusual to her placid disposition . Aunt Hanner was suspiciously  --  and noisily  --  gay . MILLBROOK 51 " Right on the dot , " she announced vivaciously . " You go ' long in , ' Li j er , and set down a minute . The ' s a new Frank Leslie 's in there if you want to see it . We ' 11 have things on the table in two jerks of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his steel-blue eyes over the top of the stove , over the kitchen table , sniffed with decreasing hope , and walked slowly and dejectedlyinto the dining room , tagged by a **27;5532;TOOLONG little daughter . The table promised well . The amount and quality of Aunt Sophrony 's linen were proverbial and Aunt Hanner 's silver was a matter of family speculation . It was apparently related in some mysterious manner to " that gamblin ' puppy 's " questionable activities . The long , wide cloth fell heavily to within a few inches of the floor . ( It would tangle and impede the knees and my father would hate it . ) A handsomesilver castor stood imposingly in the exact centre , a pickle castor ( with pendent fork ) , dominating numberlesssmall dishes : a Majolica plate in the shape of a leaf holding pickled pears ; a glass boat containingspiced watermelon rind colored  --  to my father 's disgust  --  with beet juice ; another dish of **29;5561;TOOLONG ( at sight of which his lips slightly unbent ) ; a deep amber-tinted glass dish filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) into which she had mixed  --  of all things  --  chopped cherries ; and the usual glass hat of toothpicks . Aunt Sophrony brought in a round glass plate ( which as I well knew bore round its fluted edge the inscription " Give Us This Day Our Daily Bread " ) heaped with hot biscuits cosily blanketed in white . Aunt Hanner , clucking busily to my mother , and obviously avoiding my father 's eye , came ( in the manner of Greeks ) bearing a blue covered dish in each hand . And still the thick crocheted pad before the pile of plates at the head of the table was empty . " Now , " said Aunt Hanner , upon whom my father was glowering balefully , " you pull right up . ' Li j er , you set over here where you can help Delly . " ( As if Delly needed any help  --  a wanton ruse to avoid placing him at the head where he usually sat . ) " I ' 11 be ready in a jiffy . " And withdrew to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My father 's bristling brows were like bleached cowls hooding his brooding eyes . My mother looked worried , and talked foolishly with Aunt Sophrony at her left . Aunt Harmer reappeared . Her face was flushed , her gray hair untidily pushed over her ears . In her hands she carried  --  no high-held trencher bearing the lordly bird with golden-crusted breast , but justMILLBROOK 53a dish . A round , yellow , earthenware dish with close-fitting lid . " Well , " said Aunt Hanner brightly , " I ' ve got a surprise for you ! " Heavy , and not altogether cordial , silence met the statement of an obvious fact . My mother tried to look interested . Aunt Sophrony endeavored not to appear annoyed . My father thundered silently . Aunt Hanner busied herself . She removed the cover from a dish at her left and revealed  --  carrots ! Carrots cut in little chunks and buttered ! " Horse fodder ! " Through tightly shut lips , from out blue-gray eyes cold as a frosted iron latch , even from his pink , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though he did not speak . Aunt Hanner removed the cover from a dish on her right and there were sweet potatoes , cooked in sugar ! She removed the cover from the yellow earthenwaredish before her and a familiar odor rose with the escaping steam , rose and spread and spent itself upon a hostile air . An odor that on any other day would have been greeted with unanimous delight , but which to-day fell flatter than a too thin pancake upon a lukewarmgriddle . Scalloped oysters ! If you will believe it , scalloped oysters on Thanksgiving Day ! 54 MILLBROOKAunt Hanner was busily serving and still more busily gabbling . " I bet , " she bubbled fatuously , competently servingand passing , but with shifty eyes , " ai n't none of you ever had anything but turkey and squash for Thanksgiving dinner since you were born . " " No , " said my father tersely , and eyeing the plate before him queasily , " we ai n't . " " Well , " retorted Aunt Hanner with equal asperity , " time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , " said my father , still with hands folded truculently below the table , " I do . I like mack'rel , too  --  in its place . " My mother attacked her plate vigorously and flung words convulsively upon the air . " One thing , Hanner , " she chirped jauntily , " you certainly do think of things . " " Yes , " said my father , " she does . " He was hungry  --  desperately so , but he was also , and obviously , sick with disappointment . I sat closer to him . I was sorry for him . I wanted to pat his hand  --  except that hand-patting was not done in our family . He was so like a little boy . However , he fell to . Not with accustomed fervor , but as one who suspects quinine in his applesauce . The oysters did not taste as my mother made them , but then we had never before tried oysters on Thanks-MILLBROOK 55giving Day . My mother praised the sweet potatoes and asked Aunt Hanner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My father did not taste them . Neither did he offend his tongue with the ignominy of carrots  --  known to him only as a form of sustenance for his horse . My mother and I  --  afterward , and to each other  --  pronounced the carrots by no means bad , but he forever viewed the golden root with contemptuous disfavor . Nor did he accept a second helping from a dish that we had seen him practically devour at home . He , ate sparingly , even of the rolls . He minced , and wiped his mouth with his napkin ostentatiously . My mother told Adelaide , later , that all through the meal she looked forward to the pie . Aunt Hannerwas sure to have pie  --  and pie would save the day . But when Aunt Hanner was in one of her exalted culinary moods , she , as my father said , went the whole hog . There was no pie ! There was , instead , a tall and elegant glass compote holding  --  Floating Island ! Now my mother made excellent Floating Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currant jell , but scornfully repudiated by my father as food for man . " Pap ! " he called it . " Nothin ' to get your teeth into . " 56 MILLBROOKAnd then as a crowning insult Aunt Sophrony brought in a cake oozing a viscous chocolate emulsion from between its several layers . My father did not care much for cake anyway , except a few kinds such as Miz ' Bouldry 's fig cream cake and my mother 's applesauce cake , and he especiallyhated a cake that oozed . When , therefore , his eyes fell upon what he felt to be a final insult to a perfectly competent set of teeth , he pushed back his chair . " Ai n't you going to eat your pudding , ' Lijer ? " asked Aunt Hanner with some acerbity . " I made it for Delly . " When my father was maddest he made the least noise . Mere irritation roused him to thunderous din . Now he bent choleric eyes upon Aunt Hanner , and rose . " You can let Delly have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome . " At that moment Dan'l and Philip Reed came in , ruddy , replete , grinning and gay . Their eyes swept the table with uncompromising frankness and obvious surprise . " Ought a been over to our house to dinner , Uncle ' Lijer , " Dan'l told him with the artless freedom of fourteen . " We had a twenty-pound turkey and all the fixin 's . " MILLBROOK 57 " And Ma says to come to our house to supper and come early . " " Yes , " said Aunt Sophrony , " that ' s it . Adelaide wants us all to come there to supper  --  " " Got anything left over ? " My father 's voice joyously vibrated to renewed hope . His shaggy brows bristled humorously . He laid a genial hand on Dan'l 's shoulder . " Shucks ! " Philip , with a shrug and light contemptuousglance over the scarcely littered table before him , tossed plenty to our midst . " We got a whole turkey for supper ' t we ai n't touched . Ma said you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intent , trod upon his brother 's foot . " Ma said , " he hastily interpolated , " come early , and Pa said mebbe Uncle ' Li j er ' d come right up now . He wants him to see the hogs he ' s goin ' to butcher . " Uncle ' Li j er jumped at the chance . " Why , yes , " he said cordially and without such polite hesitation as even a sister might expect , " I do n't know but I will . Want to come , Delly ? " Delly did . Later in the day my father went home to milk the cow and do other chores . He was in no such haste as he had been earlier . On his return he picked up my mother and the Aunts and brought them along to Adelaide's. 58 MILLBROOKThe table was laid . Flawless linen , pretty china , sparkling glass  --  all the accessories . Also there was food . Food utterly in accord with traditional standardsfrom roast turkey to punkin pie . They drew around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big Jim 's family and some ( but only a few ) of their immediate relations . At one end of the long table sat Adelaide . Adelaide , plump and brown , with serene complacent eyes viewing her table of plenty and the circle of kin that made her life complete  --  five children born of a happy union . William sat next his mother , his clear country-bred skin slightly flushed from an afternoon with the younger boys and the dogs , hunting rabbits ; his lips a little tight , his eyes a little shadowed , as they swept past the warm , high-colored cheeks , the ripe red lips , of Clara , the new wife at his left . Even to young , unsophisticated eyes , it was obvious that William was not at ease with his handsome bride sitting at table with these honest heirs to a proud if bucolic lineage . Beyond Clara sat Gabey , with Cory , the youngest and darling , and I between him and Philip and Dan'linseparable at meals as elsewhere ; Gran'ma Reed , rosy-cheeked , white-haired ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim , who spread-eagled from side to side of the end and beamed down the long line of faces with the benignity of a great DaneMILLBROOK 59knighted to hospitality . Around the corner and down the other side sat the company  --  my mother and father and the Aunts , and , at the corner nearest the kitchen door , Fanny Akers the hired girl , so placed for easy service . Ock Ramer , the hired man , had gone to visit relatives for the day . It took a long table and a big room to seat them all : a family of ten , and five guests . And yet farm home tables in that day were not at all embarrassed at a much larger assemblage . Eagerly anticipative they were , as if they had not already  --  at least part of them  --  sat down to an earlier feast . My father beamed . He did not lick his lips , but one knowing him for the gourmet he was could feel his own mouth watering in sympathy . Whatever Adelaide had said , as blunderingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have prepared this evening meal on the assumption that no one sitting down before it had eaten in a week . There was the turkey , as Philip had promised , twin to the twenty-pounder of the previous meal . Adelaidehad heated the stuffing , warmed the squash , and there were also heaped piles of hot baked potatoes and mounds of butter with which to moisten their fluffed insides. 60 MILLBROOKThere were ripe cucumber pickles of pale amber sweetened to tempt my father 's left molar , which he called his sweet-spicy tooth . ( " I always make one batch , " said Adelaide , " just the way I know Uncle ' Lijer likes them . " ) And there was stewed cranberrysauce to tickle Big Jim 's more pungent taste . Spiced peaches with knobby cloves as William liked them ( " Not too many cloves , Clara  --  I 'll show you exactly how to make them next year " ) . And pie . " ' Phrony said they were going to have cake , " Adelaide explained apologetically to my mother , " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like so much , ' Miry . " Punkin pie . Rich with cream , molasses , eggs and spice  --  and cheese . No pale , mild cheese to blend unnoticed with its more racy neighbor , but a cheese of character , made at a neighboring farm not far away , and ripened to a piquancy companionate to pumpkin pie as sausage is to buckwheat cakes . And cider . I almost forgot the cider . Still sweet , but edged with a sparkling barm that nipped the tongue and washed the palate free of other taste , ready for fresh anticipation of a new delight . " Looks , " observed my father wistfully , after we had dropped Aunt Hanner and Aunt Sophrony atMILLBROOK 61their door , " as if Adelaide 's folks ' 11 be eating cold roast turkey for a week . " " They might , " agreed my mother in comfortable accord , " if Adelaide had n't given us pretty near a whole milk pan full . " " Did she ? " My father 's voice fairly licked the frosty air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ! " IVVISITIN ' " VISITING " in the pleasant and leisurely ' 80s was a form of social intercourse utterly unknown to-day  --  one of the arts and graces of former living that have been sacrificed to the ruthless March of Time . The telephone has eliminated all such elements of both surprise and chance in social interchange as lent spice and suspense to an earlier day . Even if it had been possible to send word  --  by whatever roundaboutroute  --  that we were planning to visit Uncle Frank 's folks next Sunday , it was not always safe to do so , especially in winter . A sudden storm might make the roads impassable ; a horse might go lame ; a cow get sick or somebody come . We did n't , therefore , lay our plans far ahead , but on a Saturday afternoon perhaps , when everything was propitious , my father would casually say , " ' Miry , think you ' d like to go ' nd visit Frank 's folks to-morrow ? " If Frank 's folks had taken a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been unfortunate , MILLBROOK 63but I never knew such a thing to happen . So there was the anticipatory pleasure of giving surprise to Uncle Frank 's family as well as the eager thrill of our own plunge into the intimacies of theirs . So it was that Miz ' Lou Esty and David H. surprisedus one Sunday late in November of the fall that we moved to Millbrook . Miz ' Lou Esty had been neighborhood seamstress to all the families near us on the old farm , for at that time it was the custom in most country families to have the seamstress come twice a year and stay until the household sewing was done . Not only did she make up dresses for the women and girls ; she made white and colored shirts , clothes for the small boys , even to pants and coats ( often salvaged from those outgrown by their elders ) , and nightshirts  --  for the few fussy men who wore them . Mr. Larrabee was the only one whom we knew to be thus fastidious in the old neighborhood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most men , like my father , slept in an old regular shirt , past its prime in daytime service , but clean . The seamstress made women 's drawers and shimmies , petticoats ( ruffled and laced ) , corset covers , and nightgowns . She sewed hundreds of yards of unbleachedmuslin into sheets ( which became whitened in the drastic measures of the wash and , as they wore64 MILLBROOKthin in the middle , were slit and sewed together again by the outside edges ) and pillowcases . My mother , having a small family , did much of her own sewing , especially bed and table linen , and had seldom employed Miz ' Esty for more than a week at a time . Miz ' Esty had married , in her youth , a man of questionable repute , and when he was killed by lightning a few years later Miz ' Esty contendedthat it was just one more proof that God did indeed move in a mysterious way His wonders to perform . She was middle-aged , plump , slightly gray , a comfortablewidder woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which sometimes caught her in the hip should become troublesome . She had a room in the home of the Bouldrys , but , as she said , " between seams " she would one day happenin at our kitchen door to say she ' d come to set a spell and visit and do any mending that was lying around . She said she felt " to home " there . David H. was another of our old neighbors . He was a carpenter and joiner and a good one . But he was also a victim of the Demon Rum . ( That was how the ladies who brought him pledges to sign designated his misfortune . ) His wife had left him some years before , taking with her their one child  --  a little girl . MILLBROOK 65The zealous devotees of Temperance  --  feminine gender  --  had labored long and faithfully over David H. They had told him he was killing his wife , disgracinghis child . They besought him , prayerfully , to sign the pledge . But David H. was obdurate . " When David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " David H. ' 11 give up drinkin ' . But , " he would add slyly  --  " David H. ai n't goin to set his foot down . " And it looked as if he never would . After his wife left him he became a sot . He never was a public nuisance because he was a solitary drinker , crawling off into his desolate house alone until the spree was over . Then , contrite and clean , sleek and shining with the effects of soap and water , and glowingwith resolution , he would make his rounds of the neighborhood picking up jobs . Finally word came , a couple of years before we moved to Millbrook , that his wife had died  --  in Jackson . David H. disappeared for weeks . We thought he had gone for good . The little girl , we learned , had been taken to live with her mother 's relatives . But after a while we heard from David H. Someonehad seen him . He had a job in a wagon shop in Jackson . And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set his foot down. 66 MILLBROOKAnd then , to our intense surprise , a letter came to my mother from Miz ' Esty , saying that she had marriedDavid H. She said he had put his foot down . My mother said :  --  " Well , ai n't that nice ! I bet she 'll make a man of him , now ' t he ' s put his foot down . " My father snorted . " Dratted fool , " he said scornfully . " Find she ' s put her foot down too . Into a mess . First thing she knows he 'll have what little money she ' s got and drink it up . " But , from all we heard , things were going unexpectedlywell with them . David H. was working steadily and Miz ' Esty had taken her savings and bought a little house . My mother missed Miz ' Esty and often said she ' d like to see her . And then they came . On a Sunday , a nice clean cold day when all the trees were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robes of deep redbrownshining with melting frost , and whispering softly in a morning wind . They had hired a livery rig for the day  --  a lean high-boned animal , not too spirited , and a phaeton . Elegant the equipage appeared as it entered our yard along about eleven o'clock , and great was our curiosity until David H. , in a heavy linen duster , stepped out shaking down his rather tight gray trousers , followed by Miz ' Lou Esty in a plum-colored silk dress andMILLBROOK 67black dolman , both of which , as well as her befeatheredhat , were covered with dust . Besides the excitement of just seeing company , looking at their clothes ( sometimes surreptitiously trying on their hats in the spare bedroom ) , and hearingthem tell of new and interesting happenings in the world where they lived , there was always the secret anticipation of what might be found amongst the contents of pockets , reticules , and workbags . In accordance with this custom of gift bearing , Miz ' Esty brought forth a bag of candy  --  red sticks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown cinnamon . And she had brought something else . David H. took it from the back of the buggy  --  a brown paper package tied with a string the way meat came from the market . And  --  it was called bolony sausage ! That was what came of living in the city  --  you got new things . Not that bolony sausage was altogether new to folks who lived in town , and it was not entirelynew to us , for once , before we left the farm , when my father and I drove to Jackson , he had bought some and we ate it on our way home , saving a piece for my mother . It came in short fat links and was rich with sage , spiced with pepper , savory with salt , and altogether delectable . Different , quite , from anything we get68 MILLBROOKunder that name to-day , and a decided treat to us . And that was n't all they brought . They brought  --  bananas ! Now there was something new . We had seen them once or twice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father traded in Jackson  --  a strange , foreign-looking bunch of finger-shaped fruit , greenish yellow and not particularly tempting . The grocer had told my father they were thought a rare treat and suggested he try them , but Father was not to be allured by the unknown . He told the grocer that when it came to fruit , apples was good enough for him , and so until this day we had never tasted bananas . My mother and I took to them at once , but my father , cajoled into tasting , screwed his face into a mask of utter distaste and strode to the door . " Ai n't fit for hogs , " he declared . " Gim me a good Spitzenberg to take the taste out . " As if these surprising offerings were not enough , Miz ' Esty had brought a toy  --  a fascinating thing she called a " k'leidoscope . " A cylindrical tube ( or was it six-sided ? ) of cardboard coated with colored paper which , when placed endwise to the eye , revealed to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  tiny crystals falling rhythmically into countless different designs as the instrument was moved . Cory and I fell upon this delightful treasure andMILLBROOK 69spent hours with an eye screwed to the small gazing window at the end . Company on Sunday meant , of course , something extra for dinner . Housewives of that day ( and the type is not extinct ) never admitted that a dinner was quite up to expectation or required standard . " If I ' d a known you was comin ' I ' d of tried to have something a little better , but  --  " And whateverof special savoriness might elicit favorable commentwas immediately subject to apology . " Well , I ' m glad you like it , but I ca n't say so much for it myself . I usually have pretty good luck with my apple dumplings " ( for instance ) , " but to-day  --  " The trumped-up excuse following deceived no one , but was duly delivered according to the etiquette of the day . I remember that upon this particular occasion we had fresh sparerib @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was less than a week old , just of the sweet and not yet beyond the sparkle of initiatory fermentation . Big Jim 's folks had butchered that week , and after the neighborly fashion of the day they had sent us a plate of the ribs . A dinner of spareribs , succulently baked to a crisp brown and overlaid in the last hour with a stuffing of bread crumbs highly flavored with onion , sage , salt , 70 MILLBROOKand pepper , was one of my father 's favorite dishes and one of the treats of the year . Mashed potatoes whipped to buoyant subtlety with thick cream and softened butter , mashed turnip tempered with a tablespoonful of fat from the baking meat and another of butter , were considered the proper vegetable accompaniment to this particular kind of meat , with applesauce ( served in side dishes ) and the inevitable relishes from the preserve closet . These would consistof pickled pears or peaches , spiced crab apples , grape jelly or plum sauce , and ketchup . A glass of rich russet cider to clear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such a meal . My father had been looking forward to this dinner for days . He had stood around the kitchen all the morning , his nose quivering like a rabbit 's before a first growth of lettuce . He had sampled the stuffing a dozen times during the amalgamatory process , suggestinga leetle more sage ( " It ai n't quite up to snuff yet , ' Miry " ) , a mite more pepper , mebbe ( " Seems as if it lacks j-u-s-t the proper tang ; ai n't q-u-ite salt enough yet , ' Miry . Now if you pour in the rest the melted butter  --  there ! " ) . " My land , ' Li j er  --  I ' 11 have to add another loaf of bread if you keep on tastin ' . You go ' long now and wait till it ' s done . " In spite of the fact that we invariably had SundayMILLBROOK 71dinner at two o'clock winter and summer , my father always asked what time it would be ready . Not content with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times during the morning to note progress  --  with or without comment , and as the hour approached his restlessness became almost unbearable , especially to my mother . " If you do n't keep out this kitchen , ' Li je Thompson , " she would scold , " I ca n't never get dinner ready . Go ' long out now and stay out . Have you put that cider outside to cool ? " So he put the jug of cider outside to cool , and when David H. and Miz ' Esty made their unheraldedappearance he was in a ravenous state of anticipation . Even with company in the front room the obligationsof host did not sit heavily enough upon my father 's head to keep him from the kitchen . Cory ( who had come to have dinner with us ) and I had entered that odorous precinct by one door when he came slipping stealthily in at another . " ' Miry , " he whispered , " you s'pose we ought to have that cider to-day ? " My mother , caught in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise . " Why not ? " she asked . " What ' s the matter ? Ai n't it cool enough ? " 72 MILLBROOK " Yes , " said my father , his usual lusty voice subduedto a mysterious whisper , " the cider ' s all right . It ' s just  --  but I do hate to miss it . " " Well , you ai n't goin ' to , are you ? " " I do n't know ' s we ought to  --  David H. , you know  --  " " David H. ! " My mother 's bewilderment had now reached that stage where repetition was the only refuge . " What on earth ' s David H. got to do with it ? He ' 11 like it . " " That ' s the trouble , " admitted my father miserably . " I ' m afraid he  --  might like it a good deal too well ! " " Mercy on us ! " My mother flung up her hands . " A man could n't get drunk on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father replied with seeming reluctance , " he could n't . But  --  it might set ' im off . " " Phoo ! " With a stout breath of utter incredulityand scorn she thrust the exclamation at my father . " If he ' s goin ' to be set off as easy as that you may ' s well let him have it . " My father did not appear convinced , but my mother was right . No man could have behaved more circumspectly than did David H. He ate with gusto and praised every mouthful . He said  --  layinga long , well-toothed rib upon his plate and rub-MILLBROOK 73bing his mouth zealously with his napkin  --  that he had n't even seen a sparerib like that since he moved to town . He said even Miz ' Esty  --  for he continued to call her by the name under which he had courted her  --  could n't fix mashed potatoes like my mother'sand that Miz ' Esty 's cookin ' was n't nothing to turn your nose up at either . Miz ' Esty said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be as free-handed with butter and cream when you had to run out to a store and buy them  --  no matter how cheap they was  --  as if you just went down suller . David H. sluiced his throat with copious draughts and showed no effects other than those of any eminentlywell-satisfied man whose spiritual nature kept happy pace with the physical . When the apple dumplings appeared ,  --  round and roly , seamed and humorously crinkled at the nose where the pudding cloth was tied , their ivorycoloredcoats invested in thin clouds of steam , each knee-deep in its own sweet sea of lemon sauce ,  --  David H. got up and bowed profoundly to my mother . " Madam , " he said ( apparently inclined toward histrionics when stimulated by good food ) , " madam , Miz ' Thompson , your honor ! I always knew you74 MILLBROOKwas a cook part excellent . I ai n't forgot the time you invited me to Christmas dinner  --  not so long ago , either . I never , up to that time " ( with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a dinner in my life . Now " ( inclination of the torso from the hips ) " I ' ve et another . And I ' m sure " ( further recognition of his late marital adventure ) " that my honored and respected wife , excellent provider of the wants of man that she is , can but profit and benefitby such magnificent example as has been set before her . " With another elegant bow and expressive gesture of the hand he returned to his chair and fell upon his dumpling with obvious relish . My mother was embarrassed beyond words . " Well , " she retorted nervously , " I ' m glad you enjoyedyour dinner , David H. , but ' t wa n't any more ' n Miz ' Esty can do any day . And anybody could beat these dumplings . I do n't know ' s I ever had worse luck . " Miz ' Esty ( being of a sentimental nature , else how would she have married David H. after all these years ? ) beamed and blushed . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which housed a corpulent worm , and glared at my mother . " Yes , " he said , critically , " guess you ' re right . I never tasted worse , either . " MILLBROOK 75Every eye was lifted in surprise . In fact , my mother had outdone her own skill in dumplings that day and knew it . So did my father . In due time , and after David H. had been led over barns , sheds , and fields , and Miz ' Esty taken on a like inspection through the house , Clara and William came for Cory . It was nearly dark and our guests would be going soon . William urged Cory to hurry , but garrulous Clara , always eager for new acquaintances , and especially with anyone from the city , plunged into a torrent of questions regarding life in Jackson , and inside of ten minutes had made opportunity to ask David H. about jobs , and what the possibilities might be for William . I thought she looked very handsome standing there by the table , with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shining . She wore bangs on her forehead and little spit curls before her ears . Her cheeks were red , her eyes bright , and the jet on her red dress sparkled . My mother said she did n't know what Clara would do when that dress wore out because she never did any sewing , but it was a fine dress , and as a matter of fact she wore it to mill and to meeting all that winter and I do n't know how much longer. 76 MILLBROOKWilliam , slow of speech , embarrassed and angry , called sharply to Cory to hurry . David H. turned shrewd eyes upon this finelookingbut obviously irritated young man , and Miz ' Esty , always more voluble , loosed her tongue . " What you want to get to town for ? " she asked abruptly . " Ai n't you makin ' a livin ' on the farm ? " But Clara did not give him time to reply . " Livin ' ! " she admitted scornfully . " Yes , but who wants to make just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William with a dominative eye  --  " want to go where there ' s something to live for . You just die on your feet in the country . " Still William stood in angry silence . Cory had on her wraps beside him . My father and mother were inwardly writhing . Miz ' Esty voiced the naturalquestion . " What ' d you marry a farmer for , " she wanted to know , " if you do n't want to live on a farm ? " " I got to get home , " said William , suddenly and loudly . " Long ' s I live on a farm , I got farm work to do . " Clara shrugged and rose . Good-byes were exchanged , and Clara and William , with Cory , left for home , urged by Miz ' Esty and David H. to visit them in town . " What ' s the matter of her ? " Miz ' Esty asked , MILLBROOK 77reasonably enough . Under pressure of other leadingquestions regarding living conditions at the Reeds ' , my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool hussy ! " he growled . " That ' s what she is . Ai n't got the sense of a blind hawg . " VPOOR ELVIRYAsY BROWN had had a good farm before the War between the States , but when he was drafted Elviry tried to carry on the work herself , and got sick . Asy was in Libby Prison a long time and did n't get home till after the war was over , and then he was sick too . He all but died of dysentery and the doctorssaid he never could farm it again , so they sold the farm and bought the store and the little house where they now lived . Asy had a pension and his health had steadily recovered except for attacks of rheumatism , but his spirit was broken and he did n't seem to care about anything but making Elviry happy . I did not know how old Elviry was and I did not then know how sick she was , but she appeared to be the happiest woman in Millbrook . Her only child had died of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an apparently hopeless disease , and she and Asy could not have had more than aMILLBROOK 79barely comfortable living , yet she was always cheerful , always interested in her neighbors and friends  --  the two being synonymous . Her house , or rather the front room of her house , where she mostly lived , was a delightful place , more like a conservatory than a sick room on account of the many plants and flowers growing in it . Elviry 's old maid sister , Lissy Evans , lived with them and kept house . She must have been as much as thirty-five if she was a day , but she was still pretty and everybody liked her . Elviry always insisted she was n't sick , but she never went out , and she did lie down a good deal of the time . So Asy had fixed up the front room to make it specially pleasant for her , and here she stayed most of the day . The outside door and two small side windows had been replaced by one large window of clear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elviry could look out into the yard and see the masses of flowers that Asy kept growing for her in summer . And he had turned the path that used to come to the front door so it went around to the side entrance . That way the wind and storm could n't get in to Elviry . The house was small , just a story and a half with a little wing . It stood pretty well back from the road and Asy had made a perfect bower of it with80 MILLBROOKflowers that blossomed from the time of the spring violets which he had brought from the woods and meadow to the late artemesias in the fall . There was a white picket fence in front ( most of the houses had some kind of fence ) , with a gate . Elviry liked to hear the gate click because it meant someone was coming . Along the fence were hollyhocks and phlox , and near her window an old-fashioned yellow rosebush , a moss rose , and a climbing rose she called the Seven Sisters . A cinnamon rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . The smell of it crept inside . My mother had always kept some plants when it was n't too cold  --  mostly a few geraniums in the kitchen , but they usually froze and had to be thrown out . Asy , however , kept a fire going all night ( they would n't have dreamed in those days of lettingcold air in on a consumptive person ) , and so she had fuchsias and rose geraniums , and two big plants , in tubs ,  --  almost trees they were ,  --  called oleanders , rose and white and very sweet . Elviry said the blossoms were deadly poison and we must never put them in our mouth . Asy placed brackets each side of the window to hold ivies and wandering Jew , and a shelf part way to the top where Elviry grew bulbs , so when you came up to the house fromMILLBROOK 81the street it had the appearance of wearing a bouquet . There was a rag carpet on the floor , gayly striped , and a clock on a shelf that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Elviry liked to hear it strike in the night . Cory and I went there often  --  and so did everyoneelse for that matter . The room was light and full of color , and Elviry always had something gay and interesting to show or talk about . She took any number of magazines  --  Saturday Night , Hearth and Home , Fireside Companion , Godey 's Lady 's Book , Peterson 's . She had books too  --  David Copperfieldby Mr. Dickens , and Tempest and Sunshine by Mary J. Holmes , a book of poems by Felicia Hemans , St. Elmo , and many others that I do not remember . Everybody came to Poor Elviry to borrow books and papers , and everybody brought her whatever they had to offer . The women took her jellies and cookies and pretty little cakes  --  all kinds of dainty , nice things to eat , and one reason Cory and I liked so well to go there was because Elviry could eat so few of these that there was sure to be something for us . That , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to Elviry 's because we were happy there . Dr. Babcock said he ' d rather spend half an hour with Elviry Brown than a day with the healthiest woman in the county . He said she was a better82 MILLBROOKdoctor than he was because she could heal the spirit while he could only patch up ailing flesh . They called her " Poor Elviry , " but she was the richest among us all . She , for instance , was one of the few people I have ever known who appreciated the value of leisure . Of course , she had leisure forced upon her , but her inactivity was no trial to her . She liked being idle . Living in one room as she did , practically , in a small village , with the same outlook before her eyes year in , year out , she said the world was so beautiful that there was never time enough in which to enjoy it fully , especially the change of seasons . She said she did not have to travel to get a change of scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been to California . When she and Jim were first married Jim caught the gold fever and they went . All the way in a covered wagon . They stayed nearly three years and came home by way of the Horn . Adelaide had not minded the long journey , she told Elviry , for she too loved the slow action of time ; but she hated a country where there was no change of seasons , no occasional rainy days . Between Adelaide and Elviry there seemed to be a more than ordinary understanding . We heard Adelaide tell Elviry that Clara 's garrulity and gaddingtroubled her . William 's wife , she felt , shouldMILLBROOK 83be making home for her husband as was the lot of all good wives , and making home for a man meant cooking , sewing , and cleaning for him . It was not , she told Elviry , that Clara 's help was so much needed , for Adelaide was quite equal to the routine , and Fanny Akers , although not especiallybright , was an excellent worker and carried much of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to do personal things for William , such as darning , mending , and making shirts . And she herself found pleasure in seeing to the cleanliness and comfort of her family , as did other women of her times . But Clara , utterly disregardful of Millbrook standards , continued to hang over the drugstore counter , play with the little music box , gossip with Lyde Peters , and carry on low-voiced conversations in a corner with Nell . Clara liked to visit Elviry too , but then , Clara liked to visit almost anybody who would welcome her , for in spite of Adelaide 's determined sponsoringnot many doors were opened wide to her . Miz ' Dr. Babcock was a Christian woman and made out pretty well at loving her neighbors , but she could n't abide Clara . She told my mother so . " It ' s not , " said Miz ' Babcock , talking to my mother as they sat sewing together in the snug bay84 MILLBROOKwindow of our house one afternoon , " that we do n't know anything about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can even stand her outlandish music . But I do n't trust her . She do n't take hold and help Adelaide like she ought to , and she gads all over town gabbing . She spends hours over to Lyde Peters 's gossiping , and she ' s thicker ' n thieves with Nell . " She said if they did n't look out Clara was going to make trouble between Gabey and Sadie Dixon , because Clara was always having Nell up there and trying to get Gabey to take her places when she and William went , because William never seemed to want to go unless Gabey went along . Clara did n't like Sadie Dixon , Miz ' Peters said , but Miz ' Babcock said that was prob'ly because Sadie did n't like her . However , Miz ' Babcock said Gabey Reed had a pretty level head and so far he ' d just laughed at Clara and then gone with Sadie . My mother , in telling it at supper to my father , said she did n't want to be talking family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Babcock about Clara . My father said " Hunh ! " and put on his hat and went to the barn . He always went either to the barn or to the woodshed , where he kept his axe and sawbuck , when he did n't want to talk or listen . Clara certainly was a gadder but she was good-MILLBROOK 85hearted . You had to say that about her . She knew Elviry got lonesome and liked company and she ' d take her jew's-harp or mouth organ out of her pocket and play to her , and Elviry liked it . She would make paper flowers for her too : roses and sweet peas and even calla lilies . But Elviry did n't care so much about the flowers . She ' d rather have the ones she raised , but she did n't tell Clara so . Cory and I could see it , though , by the way Elviry would put the paper or feather flowers off in another room . She said she was afraid they ' d make her own poor flowers jealous because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would tell Elviryand Lissy what was stylish and what city women wore and how they did their hair . She read it out of the magazines she borrowed ; of course the other women could read the same things and probably did , but Clara talked as if she knew . She said she had lived in the city and knew what city people did . And she ' d copy the way ladies combed their hair in the magazines and fix over her few dresses to look as much like them as she could . My mother thought she looked real elegant , but my father said if she ever bent over to wring out a mop she ' d bust her clothes in ten places . Mother said maybe she would , but she would n't ever wring out a mop . It was fun for Cory and me to go to Elviry's86 MILLBROOKwhen Clara was there , for here she seemed gayer than she was at home or at our house . She and Nell Peters and Lyde used to giggle and laugh and talk a lot  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our mothers did n't let us go to the notion store . Not to hang around . If they sent us for thread or braid or ruching or hooks and eyes or anything , they always said , " Now you get what you ' re after , and come right straight out . " But when , after school or sometimes on Saturdays , we saw Clara turning in at Elviry 's we ' d either make some excuse or go anyway . We were always welcome , and Elviry kept special kinds of cookies on hand that we liked , or maybe pep'mint drops . Elviry always looked neat and tidy even if she was sick . She wore a wrapper most of the time , buttoned all the way down in front , but it was clean and pretty , with maybe little roses or violets in it , and in the afternoon she ' d change it although it might not be a mite soiled . " No use letting yourselfget careless , " she said , " whether you ' re sick or well . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had one that made her stick out behind like a shelf . My father said she ' d ought to have been a camel and done with it . My mother told him it was stylish and he said so , mebbe , was aMILLBROOK 87two-headed calf  --  in a side show , and if he was William he ' d be danged if he would n't put Clara in a side show and leave her there . Cory and I saw Clara 's bustle . She sent away for it  --  from an advertisement in the magazines . We thought it was funny . Cory said it looked like the wire flytrap her mother had in the kitchen . Fanny Akers saw it too  --  and one day when the Ladies ' Aid was meeting with Adelaide , Fanny appearedwith a bustle on as big as a boiler . A small boiler . She had made it out of a wire muzzle , the kind they put over a horse 's nose when he gnawed the manger , and she had n't fastened it on tight enough , so when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped on it . Adelaide laughed fit to kill but some of the ladies sniffed and said it was all Clara 's fault and ( after they got away ) that Clara would ruin the " hull neighborhood " before she got through . Fanny Akers said she only done it to show Clara up and that she knew all the time it would fall off . And anyway she said to my mother she ' d like to know where Clara got the money to send for such things . She said she got a dollar a week working for Miz ' Reed , and she could n't cast pearls before swine that way . Adelaide did n't know where she got the money either , but Cory did . She heard88 MILLBROOKClara ask William for it once . She said William put a silver dollar down on the bureau and walked out without a word . My mother joined the Ladies ' Aid soon after we moved to Millbrook , and she said when she came home from the first meeting she went to , which was at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town except those that were there , but most everybody was there , even Clara . She said she knew they were just dying to talk about Clara , but they could n't on account of her being there and Adelaide too . But she said you could bet their tongues would run fast enough when they got home , because Clara was dressed fit to kill with her best dress on and two or three rings and her bustle . In Millbrook there was the Missionary Circle that belonged to the Methodist Church , and the Ladies ' Aid that belonged to the Universalist Church . Once a month they joined together and had tea and cakes . Other times they each held separate meetings and attended to business , but at this monthly meeting they sewed and somebody read a story or a poem and then they had tea and talked . It was like a party . The Missionary Society ( which was not very large ) at their regular meetings always read from a book about the heathen in Africa , and sang songs  --  MILLBROOK 89 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and collected all kinds of things to put in a barrel to send to the heathen . Etty Myers had the managing of the barrel . Cory and I were there once when they were packingthe barrel , and we almost wished we were heathen because there were so many things going into the barrel that we would like to have had . There was a feather boa , and a dress with a long silk train that some woman in Jackson had given to Etty Myersbecause the train was torn . She had cut all the buttons off . When we told about it at home my father said , " Huh ! ' Bout all the sense Etty Myers had  --  send a dress without buttons when the buttons was all any heathen would want . " And he hollered when we told him about a pair of red flannel drawers Aunt Hanner sent . He said Hanner was a dumb ole fool sometimes but she was n't such a fool as that , and if Et Myers did n't know any better than to let Aunt Hanner make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said he ' d never had any hankerin ' to go to Africa , but he ' d almost be willing to hoof it there to see the heathen open one of Et Myers 's barrels . He said he could n't think of anything that would be more worth seeing than a little fat black heathen in Uncle John Nevil 's old linen duster that Lyde90 MILLBROOKbrought , and he ' d like to know whether they ' d wear the feather boa the Jackson woman sent around their necks or middles . Not , he said , that it would make any difference . Clara gave them an old hat trimmed with feathers and Miz ' Reverend Draper sent some soap . Lyde Peters brought a lot of old paper patterns that was out of style and Fanny Akers brought a game of Authors . She said somebody gave it to her for Christmas and she could n't make head nor tail of it . My father said Miz ' Draper 's soap was the sensiblestthing he ' d heard of yet , although the heathen would prob'ly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't as much sense as he thought she had and that was n't much . He said if she ' d a put her paper patterns in the backhouse they might of done some good . Cory and I managed to go to all the joint meetingsof these societies because our mothers did and we had to go where they were after school . Besides , we liked to hear the talk . And they had good things to eat , too . My father snorted when my mother came home from the Ladies ' Aid , and he said what in Tunket did she want to spend her time settin ' around with a lot of old biddies talkin ' about heathen for ? Had n't she , for Cripes sake , anything to do to home ? VICHRISTMASFoLKs did n't make as much of Christmas when I was a little girl as they do now . This was doubtlessbecause of the fact that advertising was as yet an undeveloped art and a nescient world had not awakened to the commercial value of the manger and the cross . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and until we moved to Millbrook it differed from other days only as one on which we did n't go to school and on the eve of which we hung up our stockings . Just why , no one seemed to know . My mother attempted some lame explanation , but being of a practical turn she slid unskillfully over both the miracle of birth and the myth of a beneficentsaint , and left an impression of confusion and skepticism which was doubtless all she had to give . When we moved to Millbrook , the significance of Christmas became more apparent . In the first place there was , preceding it and leading up to it , Sunday School . There had also been Sunday School94 MILLBROOKin the country , but merely as a casual event contingentupon weather , visitors , my father 's notions , and any number of other things . Here Sunday School was as much a part of the weekly programme as day school , and interest in the coming festival was quickened , not alone by visions of the promised tree , but by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related by my mother in early years , were now adorned with mysterious charm made plausible by the truth of beauty . The Universalist Church offered the only Sunday School in town , and almost every boy and girl between fourteen and twenty-four  --  also some younger and some older  --  attended the Young People'smeeting on Sunday night . Of course it made a place to go at a time when places to go were scarce , and from whence the fellows could see the girls to their homes . But it also gave them an opportunity to sing , and singing was one of the chief pleasures of youth in that day . The Reverend Mr. Draper was a well-educated , well-read , and extremely intelligent man . And by " intelligent " I mean a man of good sense , good judgment , fairness , reason , understanding ; a man who believed in God , and in some kind of continuationof life . He was , also , a man who seemed to love his neighbor even better than himself . MILLBROOK 95The fanatical attacks upon the spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revivalsand camp meetings ( and still continued in some communities ) had suffered a decline in violence in the early ' 80s . Already younger generations brazenly doubted the existence of a sulphurous hell , and the aged , quaveringly assuring each other on Wednesday nights of personal identification in BeulahLand , talked with less assurance of golden gates and clung tenaciously to a life of certitude . In the main , however , a wholesome fear of God , together with a reasonably firm belief in His mercies , still persisted in the town of Millbrook when Mr. Draper spoke his simple words of faith . Mr. Draper did not preach . He talked , and his talk was always stimulating and healing . My mother said she could go to church on Sunday morningraw as a grater and come home all smoothed out and ready for the next week . Even my father would occasionally sit through an hour at church , but Mr. Draper 's sermons were scandalously short , and the singing long . The Reverend Mr. Draper gave to Christmas Day an entirely new significance by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowded inn , the stable sanctuary , the wondering cattle , the sweet tired mother and the manger bed. 96 MILLBROOKWe saw with him the growing radiance of the sky , the great , gallant leading Star , and heard the shepherdsshout , the angels chant , and the morning stars sing together . It was a wonderful revelation that he gave us , of the coming of that Child . But he spoke of Joseph too , as the baby 's father and the tender husband of Mary , solicitous of her welfare , and never once in all the years that he lived with us , and tried to lead our stumbling footsteps into a reasonableacceptance of faith , did he ever refer to Jesus as other than a son of God , the same as we . The significance of Christmas as a season when some measure of divine love so fills the human heart that it must overflow in practical demonstration was further revealed to us . Everybody was making gifts . Of course we were not unaccustomed to gifts , for visitors always brought some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always took something , generally in the way of food . But this was different . These were Christmas gifts ; you made them , and you loved making them . Lissy Evans had a pinking iron and Gran'ma Reed had piles of white flannel , so Lissy showed Cory and me how to make needle books of white leaves with pinked edges , and covers of gay silk over cardboard . Poor Elviry showed us how to make holders out of calico pieces and penwipers out of scraps of felt . MILLBROOK 97We spent hours at Poor Elviry 's house in warm sweet secrecy , and always before we went home Lissy made us the hot chocolate we loved and gave us cake . We kept this particular brand of our handiwork at Elviry 's house in a drawer of an old mahogany bureau that she had cleaned out for our use . Lissy had put a piece of pink cambric in the bottom so that the beauty of our little gifts would be enhanced by proper background , and what time we did not spend in actuallabor was devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those whom we wished to favor  --  the Reverend Miz ' Draper , Miz ' Dr. Babcock , our mothers , Gran'ma Reed , Aunt Hanner and Aunt Sophrony , Sadie Dixon , Jennie Myers , Aunt Catherineand Aunt Martha , Clara . But our Christian charity did not carry us far enough to include Amelia . Amelia was Aunt Cathie 's and Uncle Frank 's youngestdaughter ( of our own age ) and we had a spleen against her because she would let neither of us so much as touch her candy hearts , of which she had a whole cigar box full  --  the kind that said " Will you be my girl ? " and " May I see you home ? " We told Poor Elviry and Lissy about Amelia and the candy hearts and they both thought we should try to forget the selfish inclination of our cousin and , by making her a gift , perhaps shame her into a more gen-98 MILLBROOKerous attitude . I regret to admit , however , that the zeal with which we labored in what was supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heathenishhearts to the inclusion of Amelia . Everybody made something for somebody . Nobodybought things  --  except yarn to work with and canvas and wool for mottoes . Clara made paper flowers for everybody she could think of . Aunt Hanner said you ' d think it was May Day ' stead of Christmas . A visit from my Cousin Fred at just this time lent added excitement and pleasure to the season . The whole of Southern Michigan  --  or so it seemed  --  was peopled with the Thompson clan : my father 's sisters , Aunts Hanner and Sophrony ; his niece Adelaidewith her family , in Millbrook ; Uncle Frank and Aunt Catherine with their two girls , Saryette and Amelia , who lived on a farm to the southeast ; Uncle Matt and Aunt Martha to the west  --  all cousins , nieces , or nephews of my father , and others who were more or less related . Dozens of them to swell the annual tribal gathering which celebrated Father 's birthday on January first , or augmented the family dinner at the County Fair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My mother 's folks lived far away from Jackson ,  --  MILLBROOK 99seventy miles to be exact ,  --  in the small town of Wayne , near Detroit . Visits from her people , therefore , were rare and eagerly welcomed , especially by my mother , who suffered from a plethora of ' Lijer 's relations , all of whom seemed to regard him as but one degree removed from the major prophets . When it came to forbears and blood , my mother  --  inordinately proud of being a Bogardus on one side and an Anneke Jans on the other  --  took the attitude that to boast was vulgar . But she nevertheless delighted in an exhibition , properly and politely restrained , of the more cultured arts and manners of her own people . Thus for my Cousin Fred to honor us with a visit so soon after our entrance into Millbrook'ssocial sphere gave her great delight . My father , too , liked Fred ( although between him and my grandmother was some slight strain ) , and as for me ,  --  an only child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fred 's companionship and that of an angel from heaven would have left the angel completely out . Fred , a young man and unmarried , had been a brakeman on the Michigan Central Railroad for several years , running from Detroit to Jackson . He had met with an accident , however , within the year , in which his right arm had been cut off . His foot had caught in a frog while he was pulling a switch , and he100 MILLBROOKhad saved his own life by forcefully throwing his body off the track , but the train ran over his arm . This was the first time we had seen him since . His own parents were dead and he lived with my grandmother , as did his sister , my cousin Emmy . That empty , pocketed or swinging sleeve was to me a source of great mystery , some curiosity , and not a little generous sympathy mingled with a sort of pride that it was my cousin who had had such a thing happen to him . But when he bared it , as he sometimesdid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn away . And my heart quaked in superstitious alarm when he declared that he could feel the very fingers jerk and twinge with pain even though the arm was buried almost a hundred miles away . It made a grand story to tell Cory and the boys . So my Cousin Fred was there for Christmas  --  a romantic , shy , and somewhat mysterious personage ( on account of the empty sleeve ) coming all the way from the city of Detroit ; a man who not only had traveled thousands of miles on railroad trains ( probably ) but had actually walked on top of them while they were running ! A man who had been run over by a train , had an arm cut off , and still lived ! Cousin Fred had visited us several times when we lived on the farm while he was a brakeman . Then , when he had a couple of days off he could come toMILLBROOK 101Jackson ( always for nothing ) and catch a ride out to our house . It would now have been even easier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except that he was going to work in Detroit as a flagman and could not get away as often . He did not know when he could get off again and came now only as a specialprivilege before starting on the new job . At any rate , here he was , and proudly my mittened hand clung to his unmated one on our way to the church and the tree on Christmas Eve . It was a sparkling night ; the snow squeaked and mewed underneath our feet , and when we got up to the main traveled road where sleighs , pungs , and cutters had made a harder path , Cousin Fred cavorted ( the empty coat sleeve flying ) , flung his heels like a colt , and all but tossed me into roadside drifts . Neither spruce nor fir was indigenous to Southern Michigan , and as yet the Northern forests had not begun to share their aromatic treasures with the markets . So this was what we knew as an " arbor vity " tree from the cedar swamp , or , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more tamaracks than cedars ) , its flat , frondlike twigs of brownish green mildly odorous as the heat from the stove and lamps drew pungent oils to the surface . Installed , at considerable expenditure of labor , 102 MILLBROOKtime , and a good many nails , on the pulpit platform , it presented a glamorous sight to a little girl who had never before seen such magnificence . The young people had trimmed it during the afternoon  --  Sadie Dixon , Jennie Myers , Judy Babcock and Clara , Tod Becker , Philip and Dan'l , with some of the younger ones like Tim Ordway and Bud Dixon running errands and getting in the way . Of course , Cory and I were set at tasks like stringing cranberries ( from the bog down back of Big Jim 's house ) , and popcorn which my mother had popped , and filling small cornucopias of red and gold paper with candy . Long , scalloped flounces of the jeweled necklace of berries , alternating with the snowy popcorn beads , beskirted the tree . The tiny pointed bags of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , red and pink and white , hung pendent from the pliant twigs . Clara had offered to lend her skill in ornamentationby making a paper rose for the tip of every branch of the tree . It would , she admitted , be quite a job , but she ' d be glad to do it for the church . Mrs. Draper , however , tactfully diverted such tender to a large bouquet of red roses  --  a little stiff and a little red  --  which adorned the pulpit desk . Mr. Draper said it was a lovely night to come to a birthday party , and he was sure that Jesus would beMILLBROOK 103glad to know that so many people had remembered Him , and pleased that they were celebrating His birthday by making each other happy . He said Jesus knew that every single present around that tree was a gift of love and that it did n't matter what a gift was worth in money if you gave it in love and because you were glad you could give it . Then he told the children that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as they lived . He said that Santa Claus was a lovely spirit who came around to all the houses on Christmas Eve and made our hearts tender with love and charity , and that he particularly wanted our help in giving to those who had less than we did . Then he said everyone was invited to come up to the parsonage after the tree , because Mrs. Draper and he wanted to have a little party too . He wished everybody a Merry Christmas and said let ' s get on with the programme . There were those amongst us who could have dispensed with the programme , but the Sunday School teachers had gone to considerable effort to train the children , and since you could sit and look at the tree and watch the candles wink , and speculate on what might be yours , thus postponing the ecstasy or bitterness , as the case might be , of assurance , it was borne with fortitude . Dr. Babcock and Big Jim stood be-104 MILLBROOKhind the tree with a pail of water and a dipper , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim burned his hands . The first person to " speak " was little Ranny Becker , going on four . Sadie Dixon , who was the baby-class teacher , had been drilling Ranny quite a while on a piece about " The Little Lord Jesus Asleep in His Bed , " but he suddenly got stage fright , stuck his fists in his eyes , and began to blubber . Before anyone could reach him he opened his mouth wide and bawled like a motherless calf . After that there was a quartet by Jennie Myers and Sadie Dixon and William and Gabey . Lyde Peters told my mother afterward that it gave her the strangest feeling to see the four of them standing up there and singing " Hark , the Herald Angels Sing " just the way they had before ever William went off and married Clara , and Clara sitting down in front , looking pretty glum . They had sung this same song other Christmases , and when Lissy Evans , who was the organist and planned the Christmas music , asked William after Thanksgiving if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said of course  --  why not ? They had practised a few times down at Sadie 's house and Clara had taken her a-cor-deen along and tried to keep time . Lissy , however , had had to tell her that it did n't seem to be just the right kind ofMILLBROOK 105music for a Christmas anthem , and Clara had sulked . Then she said she ' d play a piece on the programme , but Miz ' Babcock had shut down on that . Clara told Lyde that they were all a lot of stuck-up things and she ' d like to know what they ' d got to be so stuck-up about  --  lot of hayseeds they were and she wished she ' d never left Detroit . Lyde said she guessed there were others who wished the same thing . Time would tell . I do n't remember all the numbers of the programmebecause Cory and I kept nudging each other with our elbows and looking at the presents and wishing they ' d get through . Which pretty soon they did , and Mr. Draper brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it was Les ' Myers because of his blacksmith voice . They had tried to hang presents on the tree itself , but the branches would n't hold so they were piled up underneath and there was an awful lot of them . It was n't just the presents the children got from the Sunday School , but everybody had brought all the presents they had for their own families as well . This custom was followed in Millbrook for a couple of years , but they had to stop it because folks got trying to outdo each other and it made feeling . For instance , Miz ' Alf Becker was jealous because her sister-in-law , Miz ' Lew Becker , got her little girl106 MILLBROOKa wax doll that would shut its eyes and say " Mama , " when Miz ' Alf Becker could only get a china doll for Tillie , who cried and took on right at the tree . So they talked it over and decided just to have the Sunday School presents , and everybody liked it betterbecause they did n't have to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had . Aunts Sophrony and Hanner ( who really were Methodists and did n't quite approve of all this flumdoolery ) always gave my father socks and mittensthey had knitted themselves , and these they laid on the floor under the tree , neatly folded and with my father 's name written on a piece of paper  --  " Elijah Thompson from his faithful sisters , Hannah and Sophrony . " But he would n't walk up to the platformthe way he was supposed to when Les ' Myers called his name out and said :  --  " Now here ' s a present for a good boy , little ' Lijer Thompson . Trot up here , ' Lije , and try ' em on . If they do n't fit we ' 11 give ' em to Big Jim . His feet ' s bigger ' n yours . " My father wiggled in his seat and his ears got red and Mother pushed me out of the seat and said , " You go up and take ' em , quick . " I think she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he might have , except that he would n't want everybody to see him . When we got home , he thundered around andMILLBROOK 107said , " Man ought to be shot , makin ' such a tarnation fool himself  --  caperin ' round like a bull calf in the wind ! " But when my mother 's name was called ( and Les ' was funny about that too , and said Santy Claus had told him to kiss all the pretty little girls that came up to get their presents ) she marched up there straight as an Injun with her head up and her bonnet strings snapping . Her skirts and her coat thrashed out around her the way an apple tree whips in the wind . And when he gave her her present , she stood there and looked him in the eye and everybody laughed . But she did n't . She looked sort of grim and came marching back . And then they laughed at Les ' . Her presents were gingham aprons the Aunts had made , a pincushion from Cory made from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fastened on the top , a needle book I had made for her , and a bouquet of artificial sweet peas from Clara . I got a bottle of Jockey Club from Lissy , who was my Sunday School teacher , a book of Greek Mythologyfrom Miz ' Draper , and mittens from the Aunts . The Jockey Club was in a fancy box with embossed flowers on the cover . I did n't care much for it . There was a beautiful wax doll way up at the very tip top of the tree all dressed in blue tarlatan with a silverribbon around her waist , and although I did n't108 MILLBROOKcare anything about dolls of any kind , that was so lovely and so different from anything I had ever seen that I coveted it and I was almost sick when the Jockey Club and the Greek Mythology fell to me instead . The doll , however , came to Cory  --  Big Jim had bought it weeks before in Jackson and kept it hidden . This compensated for my own disappointment , for now I could look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us ever did ) . When they were pretty nearly through , Cory whispered to me that Flora , Mert Hesker 's little girl ,  --  who was about seven and never came to Sunday School ,  --  had n't had a single thing and there was almost nothing left . The Heskers were very poor and Cory said Flora did n't have any clothes to wear to Sunday School . Mert had had his leg cut off in the sawmill the winter before and it had n't healed very well . Miz ' Hesker worked out , but there was n't much extra work to be had in the winter . So I whispered to my mother and she motioned to Lissy and they took my new mittens and a pair of stockings Aunt Hanner had knit for Cory and did them up in the paper my Jockey Club was wrapped in and sneaked them up to the tree with Flora 's name on them . I wanted to give her my Jockey Club , but Mother would n't let me . Adelaide had to hang onMILLBROOK 109to Cory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Adelaide said afterwards , far as she was concerned she ' d have let Cory give it , because she ' d have been happier giving it than she ever would be playing with it , but that Big Jim had had such a good time buying it and lugging it home and hiding it that he ' d have been hurt if she had . Flora cried when her name was called and would n't go up to get her present , but her mother did . Cory and I felt very happy and good . When all the presents had been given out and the cornucopias and strings of popcorn taken down and given to the littlest ones and those that got the least gifts , Mr. Draper stood up and said a little prayer and thanked God for letting us have His son , Jesus , to love , and for the good time we had had . Then he repeated the invitation to go over to his house . " It ' s not late , " he said , " only about eight o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we ' d like to have you all come . " Of course not everybody went . Most of the Methodists went home and all the old folks  --  except the Aunts . My father said wild horses could n't keep them from going where anything was going on , but Adelaide and Jim , who had brought them , said it would be easier for them to come along than to have to take them home. 110 MILLBROOKAll the young folks went  --  Gabey and Sadie and William and Clara and Jennie Myers and Freda and Ed Calkins . It was a wonder , Lyde Peters said , that for once Ed was sober enough to go , but he was . My father and mother went home and Cousin Fred with them . My father said he ' d had all the tarnation traipsin ' and caperin ' he could stand for one night and he was going to bed . My mother wanted Fred to go along with William and Clara , but he said no , he guessed he ' d go home with her . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet and he did n't like to go where there were strangers . But my mother let me go to the party with Cory . When they talked about the Christmas tree the next day my mother said she guessed the only ones that were not there were Old Aunt Het and Etty Myers . My father said if Etty Myers was fool enough to stay away from a Christmas tree because it was in a Universalist Church she ' d ought to stay away because she ' d be out of place . And he said if Old Aunt Het ' d ruther shut herself up over there with the graveyard and Dud Otis for company , the ' could n't nobody help it . VIIOLD AUNT HETOLD AUNT HET was nobody 's aunt but Nell Peters 's . Aunt Het Peters lived on Stony Road that led north from Main Street between the Methodist Church on one side and Aunt Hanner 's house on the other . The house was little and old , and squatted beyond the graveyard that lay along the road behind the church . Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere , but Cory and I walked up past there sometimes after school looking for hazelnuts that grew along the stone fence , and sometimes we got a glimpse of her , or of Dud Otis , the boy that lived with her , or of Quint Sharpe , the Atheist , who lived on the next farm . Quint Sharpe used to work Aunt Het 's farm on shares before she got Dud Otis , and the neighbors told us that Aunt Het was about the only one around that would have had him , because he did n't believe in God . Miz ' Alf Becker , who was telling my mother about112 MILLBROOKit , said , well , maybe that was why he did n't use the Lord 's name as loosely as most of the other men did , because he did n't believe in Him . She said when Alf said " God-damn-it-to-hell " he said it just like he believed God would damn it to hell , but no one ever heard Quint Sharpe say such a thing , prob'ly because he did n't think there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shunted off from Quint like they were afraid of him because a man that did n't believe in God was queer . He looked queer enough  --  sort of like a scarecrowas Cory and I saw him once out in the cornfieldhelping Dud haul in some stalks . He was very tall and thinner than a corn stalk itself , and he bent over like he was too skinny to stand up without being tied to a pole . His arms were long and hung down straight when he walked , and he had a black moustache that showed white teeth when he laughed . And he laughed a great deal . Ock Ramer said he was always laughing . Cory and I saw him throw his head back and laugh , and Dud Otis laughed too . Then they saw us and waved their hands , but we turned away and walked on very fast . Cory told about it when we got to Adelaide 's and Fanny Akers said she should n't think they ' d see much to laugh at , either of them , dancing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reed said , MILLBROOK 113Shaw , they probably was n't any nearer hell than half the men in town . And anyway , she said one time when Aunt Het was sick Quint Sharpe took care of her stock and her fires and fetched and carried for her , more , she noticed , than any of the Christians around there had offered to do . Philip said Quint Sharpe ' d walk five miles to take care of a sick cow and nobody ' d ever seen him lay welts on a tired horse the way Alf Becker did , and Dan'l said all he knew about Quint Sharpe was he would n't let nobody set steel traps around his place . Gabey said , " Aw , they ' re all right , both of ' em  --  if you kids was n't snoopin ' around where you had n't any business to , they would n't of waved their hands to you . " But there were better hazelnuts along that road than anywhere else and so we continued , a few times more that fall , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would see us and speak . Only twice , however , did we see her . Once when she was going to the house with her apron gathered up the way women do when they 've been to the barn after eggs . She walked very straight with her head flung a little back and taking quick short steps . She had a sunbonnet on her head . But she did n't see us  --  or if she did she did n't let on. 114 MILLBROOKAnother time we saw her standing bareheaded under a walnut tree with a shawl around her . It was late fall and cold and no sun shining . The sky was like lead and the trees were bare . The walnut tree stood on a low sharp ridge north of the house and it was bent a little where all the western winds had whipped it . The ground was covered with nuts and Aunt Het had a basket , but she was not picking them up . She stood very still and straight and she was staring off into the west the way the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cory and I could n't look at her . She was like all the lonely things in the world turned into one and made us want to run home . Cory said prob'ly she was thinking there was n't any use picking up walnuts when she had n't any family to crack and eat them at night . I said she had Dud Otis , had n't she ? And Cory said he was n't her family even if folks did say she had adopted him and was going to leave him all her property . Talk was , she said , that Dud was running with a bunch of bums in Jackson and went there every Saturday night . Ock Ramer said that sometimes Dud came home drunk . This Dud Otis was a boy that Old Aunt Het took in . Her husband , whose name was Hiram Peters , had died years ago , and just as well , Gran'ma ReedMILLBROOK 115said , because he was a bad egg to start with and got worse . Gran'ma Reed said Het Peters had been ashamed of the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she married him , she guessed , and had refused to be neighborly even with her , her oldest friend . Then Aunt Het 's only son married Lyde Bailey , whom Aunt Het could n't abide , and when Nell , their little girl , was three or four years old he had gone away to war and got killed . But instead of having Lyde and Nell come to live with her and look after her the way folks thought she would , Aunt Het would n't let Lyde darken her door , and so Lyde would n't let Nell darken her door either . A few years before we went to Millbrook Aunt Het 's brother came to town from nobody knew where , as Miz ' Alf Becker said , but instead of going to Aunt Het 's to live and help with the chores the way you ' d expect a man would do , he took a notion he ' d rather live with Lyde , who was only his nephew 's wife . He was almost eighty . He sat on the tavern stoop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store in winter and everybody called him " Uncle John . " His name was John Nevil . He had been a millwright . Of course all that had made Aunt Het bitterer than ever . She would n't go anywhere or to anything116 MILLBROOKand she had practically shut the door in everybody 's face . Miz ' Alf Becker said she did shut the door in her face once when she went to ask if she ' d got anything to donate to the Missionary Barrel , and she ' d never get the chance to do it again . Miz ' Becker said the neighbors said that Aunt Het would have liked Nell to come to see her and even sent word by Miz ' Quint Sharpe when she went over to Lyde Peters 's notion store once , but Lyde said not by a jugful . If she was n't good enough to put her foot over the threshold of Aunt Het 's door , no daughter of hers should either . Then all of a sudden , Miz ' Becker said , there was this Dud Otis coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At first he used to come over to town nights and hang around the streets , but folks did n't like him . He talked dirty . The men of Millbrook , Miz ' Becker said , did n't pretend to be no saints , but they did n't like to see a feller young as Dud Otis was know so much about nasty things in the city . Miz ' Becker said the men did n't seem to blame him so much , because it looked like he ' d just grown up in dirt , but they did n't like it just the same  --  not from a stranger . And the boys did n't take . to him either . He was too smart and knew too much for them . Miz ' Becker said he ' d been a good-looking boyMILLBROOK 117when he came there , after Aunt Het got him cleaned up and some new clothes on him , and he was good- looking yet so far as features went . He was much as twenty-three or four by this time , and he was rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some if unhappy impressions had not shown so clearly on his face . As it was he always looked aggressively sullen and suspicious as if he felt the world against him . Now he almost never came over to Main Street . They did n't have any mail and he did their market- ing in Jackson . Folks said he was an atheist too , because he ran with Quint Sharpe all the time . I do n't suppose the people of Millbrook had much of an idea what an atheist really was , but to their minds , anyone who countenanced Bob Ingersoll , or read his speeches , was an atheist . Ock Ramer said that Dud Otis read all the papers said about Bob Ingersoll and sent for his speeches , where he said the Bible was n't any more the word of God than the almanac was . They talked about it at the Ladies ' Aid , and Aunt Hanner said , Bosh ! And how did they know the almanac was n't the word of God ? It told all about the weather , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather ? Etty Myers was terribly shocked and said she118 MILLBROOKdid n't know how Aunt Hanner dared talk so  --  old woman as she was . She should think she ' d be afraid the Lord would strike her dead . And Aunt Hanner snorted her horse-snort and said that when her time came she hoped the Lord would strike her dead . She said she could n't think of anything worse than dragging out . Etty Myers said Aunt Hanner sounded as if she 'd been reading Bob Ingersoll and Aunt Hanner said she had . She said she thought he was a smart lawyer , and that folks in Peoria , where he lived before he went to Washington to see if he could help the government , said he was a good man . Etty Myers threw up her hands and said " Tsck ! Tsck ! " against her teeth . Aunt Sophrony looked a little worried , and my mother 's eyes shone and her mouth twitched and I knew she was thinking about telling it to my father . Cory and I were there ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Miz ' Thompson and Adelaide Reed , I ' m flabbergasted to think you ' d let your innocent little girls set there and listen to such blasphemous talk ! " My mother looked at me as if she were surprised to see me there , her lips still twitching , and Adelaidedid n't even look up . Neither of them said a thing . Aunt Hanner said , " Pooh ! They ai n't dumb ifMILLBROOK 119they are little . They 've got to learn , ai n't they ? " " They would n't learn about fiends in human form like Bob Ingersoll if I had my way , " said Etty Myers , and Aunt Hanner said tartly , " No . Nor anything else  --  sensible . " Everybody kept their eyes on their work  --  except Aunt Hanner . She was n't working . She took an apple off the dish on the table and bit into it and chonked it . And pretty soon Etty Myers , who could n't let anything drop , said darkly , " Well , you mark my words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throwing the Bible in your face and follering after a man like Bob Ingersoll . " And yet , Miz ' Becker told us , for a while it looked as though he were really going to be like a son to Aunt Het , for he slicked up the place and repaired the barn and raised hogs , and once , Miz ' Becker said , Alf saw them actually out riding in the buggy when he was over on a back road buying calves . But after a while Dud 's good fortune seemed to go to his head and he took on a smart-alecky aggressive- ness that cut off his last association with the village . Then , Miz ' Becker said , he began to sneer about Millbrook boys and call them hayseeds . He told William once , so Ock Ramer said , that if he ' d go to Jackson with him some Saturday night he ' d show him something he ' d never see in no rube town like120 MILLBROOKMillbrook . That was before William was married , but Ock said William told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with fellows in Jackson and the rougher element around the country , and he paid less attention to Aunt Het 's farm . But he always insisted on being called by the name he had brought with him  --  Dud Otis . Whether Nell Peters ever actually took advantage of Aunt Het 's churlishly extended hospitality or not , no one at that time could truthfully say . Lyde had forbidden her to cross a threshold closed to her mother , but Nell 's regard for her mother 's commands , or wishes either , was pretty lax , and if Nell had wanted to go to Aunt Het 's she would probably have done so , but what she would want to enter so dour and forbidding a door for , no one could conceive . Certainly not for love of a grandmother whose affectionshe had never known . And certainly not for any apparent interest in Dud Otis . And yet , one bleak November afternoon at dusk , when I was hurrying away from Aunt Hanner 's house , where I had been sent on some belated errand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shawl over her head , cut down across the Methodist burying ground to the back of Hank Ordway 's hardware store . VIIITHE DANCETHERE was a dance over at Concord along in February and everybody was going . Everybody but us , that is , and all the old cripples in town . Even the babies would go , because people took the very littlest children and put them to sleep on the beds . My father said cripples or no cripples he was n't going to begin cutting up and capering at his time of life , and he was n't going to have Delly begin gallivantingaround the country her age , either . Time enough after she ' d got red of her milk teeth . It made me sick that Cory could go and I could n't , but Cory could always go because Adelaide and Big Jim , even Fanny Akers the hired girl , went to all the dances . And naturally they had to take Cory . Adelaide told us afterward that Clara had said that Gabey was going to take Nell Peters to the dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it was no such thing . He said he had never asked Nell to go nor intended to , and if Clara had dragged122 MILLBROOKhim into it she could now drag him out or let him alone . He was going to take Sadie Dixon to the dance , just as he had intended to do all along . Clara told Adelaide that she had asked him to take Nell Peters because she could have a better time if Nell went with them than she could with Sadie . She admitted that he had n't ever really said he ' d take Nell , but had laughed when she asked him , and let her think so . Then , when the time came , she said Gabey said if she ' d had the sense God gave geese ( which , according to my father , she had n't ) she ' d have known he was going to take Sadie . He had n't ever taken anybody but Sadie in his life and he did n't intend to . So then Clara tried to get William to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his cutter was n't big enough . She told him Nell could sit on her lap and he said , get two of their size on one side the cutter , he knew where they ' d land . She had hinted to Adelaide that it would be nice if Nell could ride with them , and Adelaide said she and Jim were going with the Dixons  --  Sadie 's father and mother  --  and there would n't be room because there were Phil and Dan'l and Cory and Bud Dixon , Sadie 's brother . Adelaide said she ' d of felt terrible if Gabey had taken Nell Peters to the dance because there he ' dMILLBROOK 123been going steady with Sadie Dixon ever since they were children and it did n't seem as if she could stand having another son go with a nice neighbor 's girl right up till he was old enough to marry her and then run off and marry somebody else . ( Gabey was n't old enough to marry anybody yet  --  he was only nineteen . ) Sadie Dixon was the prettiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she was soberer than Sadie , even before William got married the way he did . Jennie was taller , too , almost as tall as William , and she was n't much of a hand to talk . ( Did n't get a chance , Aunt Hanner said , with Etty Myers around . And why would n't she be sober  --  no mother and that old pucker-berry to live with ? Aunt Hanner said she could n't see how Les ' Myers ever come to have such a sister , kind of man he was . ) The Babcocks had a daughter too  --  Judy , but she went to Albion to college and we did n't see her often . She was studying music and she was n't at home enough to go around with the young folks much . Nell Peters did n't seem pretty to Cory and me because she was too dark , like her mother , and her eyes were bold . She stuck out , too , over the top of her corsets ( almost the way Clara did , although she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud. 124 MILLBROOKBut Sadie Dixon was pretty and gay and sweet . She was only eighteen that winter , but she had her third-grade certificate and was teaching the primary in the Millbrook school . Sadie , Gran'ma Reed said , was the spittin ' image of her father , Si Dixon , when he was a young man , only his hair had been mixed up with dust from the mill so long you could n't tell what color it was now , but it had been bright like Sadie 's . Cory had bright hair too , but it was bright like young corn silk . Sadie 's was like gold , and curled . All around her forehead and ears , especially when it rained , the little kinky curls would glisten like coils of tiny golden wires . She was n't very tall  --  neither was Si  --  and she was small , but not thin and puny like Cory . Her face was not quite round because it pointed down to the chin , but her arms were round and there were dimples at her elbows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the violets that we found in the woods , with eyebrows and lashes darker than her hair . William had blue eyes too , but they were a light blue that looked cold when he was angry . Gabey 's were gray and laughing . Gabey and Sadie always laughed a great deal  --  saying silly , foolish things they thought nobodyMILLBROOK 125understood but themselves . Sadie 's teeth were shiny white and when her lips were shut you wished she would open them so you could see her teeth , and then when they were open you wished they were shut because they were so pretty . We loved her . My mother said she should think Adelaide would be worried , if Gabey was going to lose a girl like that . And my father said , " Do n't worry . There could n't be two such fools in one fambly . " Anyway , Gabey took Sadie and that left Nell Peters to get to the dance any way she could . She finally went with Ed and Freda Calkins . Uncle John Nevil was sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night my mother told my father she had to walk up to Adelaide 's to take my new knitted hood that Adelaide wanted to borrow for Cory to wear . My father shouted : " What ? You goin ' up to Adelaide 's this time o ' night ? " " Yes , " she said , " it ' s only six o'clock . " " Pitch dark , " he growled , " and snow fallin ' . You ai n't goin ' to do no such thing . " My mother , however , was determined ; partly , I think , because she sought a little vicarious , if wistful , pleasure in the preparations of others for the dance . Adelaide was already dressed . She wore a brown126 MILLBROOKdelaine trimmed with golden-brown velvet , a narrow vest of this with a row of amber glass buttons close together down the front of the basque which flared suitably over her ample hips . At her throat was a little brooch of gold with a bit of coral in it . Gran'ma Reed had given it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair was parted in the middle of her broad smooth forehead and puffed a little over her ears . She wore no ornaments other than her brooch and her wide wedding ring , but she was a handsome sight  --  her brown eyes glowing with pleasant anticipation , her cheeks flushed . I thought she was beautiful and touched the velvet on her dress with shy , adoring fingers . " You go on up to Cory 's room , Delly , " she said . " Maybe you can help her . I got to set the cakes for breakfast . " So I went up to Cory 's room , and there was not only Cory in her new blue challis dress thickly sprigged with tiny roses set in leaves of green , but also Clara , sitting before the glass on Cory 's little bureau in her underclothes  --  shimmy , corset and corset cover , and petticoat of white muslin edged with rickrack , doing strange and unaccountable things to her face . " Hello , " she said . " Come on in . You tie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't hardly begun to get ready yet . " Cory barely spoke . She looked embarrassed , miserable , and her eyes , after meeting mine , turned to the bureau before Clara and dropped with shame . Clara was painting her face . I tied Cory 's ribbons , one at the end of each long white-gold braid , but my fingers trembled , my eyes shifted , I could not talk . Cory was obviously concerned . Clara should not be in her room , doing something that by her own admission she dared not do in William 's . " He makes such a fuss , " said Clara , turning her face this way and that like a hen , " if I just put a little powder on my face . If I get it fixed before he sees me he wo n't know the difference . " In one hand she held a curious-looking little piece of pink , chalky material shaped like a small fluted shell , and smelling of cologne . Against this she vigorously rubbed a piece of chamois skin which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn left  --  a brush here , a stroke there , until she apparently reached a stage of comparativesatisfaction . Then she took an artificial red rose made of cloth . She stripped a leaf from it , moistened it against her tongue , and rubbed it on her cheek . A crimson blush128 MILLBROOKflared out upon her skin , which was like the thick clotted cream of yesterday . Cory and I stared . " Some of the girls I know in Detroit , " said Clara , blending the damask of the rose with the perfumed powder on her face , " have something on purpose , but I could n't have anything like that  --  William ' d have a fit . " We were silent . She loosed tendrils of her black hair and , wetting them with her fingertips touched to her tongue , shaped them to little spiral curls before her ears . ( They were called spit curls . ) She smoothed the square straight fringe of her bangs down upon her forehead . With her wetted fingertips she brushed the powder from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d put some red on my lips too  --  if I was home , " she said , " but prob'ly all these jayhawkers ' d think I was fast  --  or something . The ' do n't anybodyknow how to dress up around here anyway . " She took perfume from a bottle and dabbed it on her hair . She sprinkled Florida water from anotherbottle onto her bosom . She leant forward , her hands on the edge of the bureau , and peered into the glass . And I looked at her fingernails . They were bitten and they were not clean . " There ! " she said . " How do I look ? " MILLBROOK 129She got up and turned toward us . Cory and I glanced at each other  --  glanced away , and down . Our faces burned . " You  --  you look  --  pretty , " Cory faltered . I did not speak . I went and sat down on Cory 's bed . Clara laughed . Then she fastened on her bustle under her petticoat . It was made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adelaide kept on the dining table over a saucer of vinegar and sugar . The bustle had a canvas belt that buckled around her waist and it sat out on her back like a shelf . I felt that I should not look , but could not keep from looking . Aside from Cory , whose bedroom I had often shared , as she had mine , I had never seen another humanfigure than my own even partially unclad . My mother dressed and undressed either in the privacy of her own room or in the dark . Girls and women were reared to a modest reservation of their physical charms , whatever they might be . Clara was not so inhibited . She would bare her legs to the knees when washing her feet in the kitchen irrespective of who was present . She would go into Gran'ma Reed 's room to dress in the mornings because  it was warmer , stripping off her nightgown beforeshe put on her underclothes , until Gran'ma Reed spoke to her about it . She told my mother. 130 MILLBROOK " The girl ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bet if the truth was known she undresses right beforeWilliam . " Clara lifted the skirt of her dress above her head and you could see the hair in her armpits , coarse and black . Her breasts , held tight in corset and laceyokedcover , swelled out . The dress dropped over her head and she shook it into place . It was heavily lined , and there was another lining skirt of silk sewed into it at the belt , with braid on the bottom , but she really had on only one petticoat . Everybody wore two at least . Clara spoke about it . She said it made her hips look too big to wear more petticoats . She said she did n't care what other folks did . She waggled her hips a little and pulled the skirt into place , shaping its gathers and loops over her bustle , and fastened it . It was tight and came to the floor , and as she shook it out I saw that she had on slippers ! Black satin slippers covered with beads . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if she had seen . She had , and on her face was a look of envy . I felt it too . We had never seen anything like them . Clara took up her basque  --  it was a new dress . We had never seen it . Or thought we had n't  --  except for the color . It was a deep wine-red . " It ' s only my old red one , " she explained a littleMILLBROOK 131bitterly . " I been making it over . If William do n't get me a new one pretty soon I ' ii go out and get myself one . " She had remodeled the dress  --  tightened it , retrimmedthe overskirt with some kind of fancy braid that , she explained , she had ripped from another . It was passementerie . There was a vest of the braid  --  gold and red with flecks of green , and a row of glass buttons , glittering and sharp . The basque was stiffly boned with a high collar also of the braid , fastened in front with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top and buttoned tightly at the wrist . I thought it a handsome dress and wondered that she should expect William to get her a new one when this was still so good . Adelaide 's dress was new , but it was the first she had had in ages . My mother 's best dress had served for years . Women did not have new best dresses often . They wore them as they were for a long time , then made them over , as Clara had done . " Now , " she said , when , having preened and turned before the glass , she seemed to think she was all right , " look here , girls . Do you suppose I dast to wear these ? " She took from a box on the bureau  --  a little giltcoveredbox with a picture on the outside of the cover132 MILLBROOKand a mirror on the inside  --  a pair of earrings , gold with a green jewel pendant . " I ai n't even seen these since I come to the country , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend . What do you s'pose William ' d say ? " " Are your ears pierced ? " gasped Cory , goggleeyed . " Of course they are , " said Clara shortly . " All the girls had their ears pierced . " " Gran'ma Reed 's ears are pierced , " I said . " She showed me her earrings . " " Ma 's ears are pierced , " Cory suddenly remembered . " She told me she did it herself when she was a girl . With a needle held against a cork . But she do n't wear earrings . " " She ' d look nice with earrings , too . " Clara was fastening the rings in her own ears . The effect was stunning . They dangled exotically against her thick , smooth neck . " You girls ought to have your ears pierced , " said Clara generously when she was ready to go down . I thought of what my father would say . Cory looked eager . " I ' 11 pierce ' em some day , " Clara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It wo n't hurt a speck . " We heard the boys going down . Big Jim was already down . Gabey had gone after Sadie . MILLBROOK 133 " I ' m going to wear ' em . " Clara was suddenly decisive . She tightened the earrings expertly . " If William do n't like it he can lump it . No sense his acting so . I brought my things in here , " she added , " so I could get bundled up before he sees me . " She put on her coat , fitted a hat carefully upon her head , and threw a lacy fascinator over it , half concealing her face . She took up her mittens . " Mercy ! " she said . " I almost forgot my ar'tics . They ' re in the hall closet  --  you get ' em , will you , Delly ? " I got them . She put them on , revealing black stockings with colored embroidery  --  purple and green  --  just above the slippers . These she did not explain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where ' s William ? " asked Clara as we joined those waiting below . " He ' s gone out . There he is now . You better step out . The horse hates to stand . It ' s cold . " Clara opened the door . Sleighbells jangled . Cold came in , and a few flakes of snow . The door closed . The Dixons came . Big Jim and Adelaide and the boys went out . Cory went with them . They shouted and laughed . Sleighbells rang . Horses stamped . Voices faded. 134 MILLBROOKWe stayed a little while with Gran'ma Reed , then we went . We did not talk . I was thinking of Clara , of what William would say . I do not know what my mother was thinking , but I wonder now if she did not wish there were less than twenty years between her age and my father 's . Of what happened later I was not a witness , but a blind man could have related in meticulous detail every act that took place , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated , so vividly the picture drawn . Adelaide , Cory said , stared at Clara in amazed disapproval when she removed the shielding wraps , and Clara had the grace to shift her eyes embarrassedly . Miz ' Dixon , too , had turned away from Clara 's painted face . Adelaide led the way to the ballroom with her head held high , Cory beside her , and keeping well ahead of Clara . Big Jim and Si Dixon were waiting for them by the door , and Cory said when Big Jim 's eye fell on Clara she thought he was going to jump at her , but he did n't move . She said he clamped his lips togetherand Adelaide went and stood beside him . Then Sadie and Gabey came along and GabeyMILLBROOK 135grinned when he saw Clara and said , " Well , ai n't it a little late for Christmas trees ? " Sadie said , " Hello , Clara , " and they went on . Sadie had on a pretty green cashmere dress trimmed with green fringe . Then William came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clara he just turned and started for the door . But Adelaide stopped him . " William , " she said , " come here . " He turned and looked at her and stood still . Adelaide went up to him and Cory could n't hear what she said , but he did n't answer . He just stood there , staring out the door , his lips thin and stiff . He combed his hair straight back , but it was short , and Cory said she thought actually it was going to stand straight up . Then Adelaide spoke to Clara and Clara went up to them , and Cory went too , because the Dixons had gone on . The fiddles were tuning up . Adelaide said , " Clara , you go to the dressing room and wipe that stuff off your face and take off them earrings . That may be the way girls fix themselves up in Detroit , but they do n't here . I do n't care any-. thing about the earrings myself , but I do about the paint . Cory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So she and William sat down in some chairs along the wall . Big Jim was talking to a man. 136 MILLBROOKCory said Clara was tearing mad and cried till she got her face all gaumed up with the red and the powder . She wet her handkerchief from a pitcher of water that stood on a washstand and scrubbed it , and talked all the time . She said she did n't know what she ever wanted to marry a country hayseed for and would n't if she had n't had trouble and wanted to get away from Detroit ; and that ' s why she came out to the country  --  to get away , and then the folks she was visitingsaid William had a lot of money and she ' d have everything she wanted if she married him . But Williamwas nothing but an old stick-in-the-mud and did n't have a cent only what his father paid him , and she wished she ' d never seen him . Cory said she kept thinking " The rest of us wish so too , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her up and they went out . And Cory said now she did n't need any paint on her cheeks , because she was mad . They went to where the others were and sat down . There was a square dance on the floor and they watched . Nell was already dancing with Ed Calkins . After the dance he went downstairs to the bar and stayed . The room was lighted by kerosene lamps fastenedMILLBROOK 137to the walls with tin reflectors behind them . The floor had been sprinkled with wax and the dancing feet would polish it down . A big round stove in the corner of the hall near the door that went downstairswas red hot . The room would soon get dusty and the women 's skirts would sweep up the wax . The lamps might flare from the vibration and the chimneys blacken , but there would be no smoke from tobacco . If the men wanted to smoke they must go outside or to the bar below . After the square dance there was a schottische and Big Jim and Adelaide danced it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my father said that while he could n't abide seeing folks old enough to know better get up and caper around like an ox , it was almost worth while to be cheated out of your bedtime to see Big Jim and Adelaide do the schottische . In the first place , Jim was six feet six inches in his stockings . His feet were like miniature scows and his hands proportionate . He was broad and big , with a head like a lion , and a nose that was like a huge beak . He was slow in all his movements , but sure on his own ground , and he did not undertake anything he could not do . Adelaide 's head came to his shoulder . She was138 MILLBROOKpleasantly plump and she moved with confidence which made for grace . When they stood out on the floor everyone turned to look at them . They faced each other and bowed  --  Adelaide with a curtsey that dipped her skirts . Big Jim drew his right foot back , a little to the left , scraping it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position , bending his long , loose figure before her , his arms hanging free . Then off they went  --  a little run , a little slide , a skip , a turn :  --  Wu-hun , two-huh  --  three-four  --  Wu-hun , two-huh  --  three-four  --  Wu-hun , two-huh , wu-hun-two-huh  --  Clara and William danced too , but not to the end . They soon sat down . They did not speak . And just then , Cory said , Dud Otis came in with some other young fellows . They stood in the door talking a little too loudly  --  and laughing . Everyone was terribly surprised , because Dud never went to any social affairs around Millbrook and Adelaide said they knew he had been drinking or he would n't have come now . When the dance was over Dud walked up to Williamand said , " Good evenin ' , William . I ai n't never had the pleasure of meeting your wife yet . " MILLBROOK 139Adelaide told us she did n't know , at first , whether William would knock Dud down or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just said , " Hello , Dud , " and walked away . Dud grinned and bowed and said , " Can I have this dance , Miz ' Reed ? I ai n't dressed up much  --  but mebbe I ' d pass in the dark . " Adelaide said he was n't dressed up  --  in fact he even had on a flannel shirt and no necktie . His shoes were not very clean and his hair was n't slick . His face was flushed and his eyes glittered as if he dared the whole crowd to say anything , and he bent his head over to Clara 's face and talked to her . Adelaidesaid she was scared to death for fear of what William would do , but William had gone out to a back room where some of the older men were playing seven-up . Dud 's friends looked on for a little while , watchingDud and Clara , then they went out . It was a waltz , Adelaide said , and she said Dud was a good dancer and so was Clara . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dud took Nell ,  --  just came and grabbed hold of her without even asking ,  --  and Adelaide said when it came time to " swing yer partners " Dud swung Nell so long and held her so tight everybody was looking . And when the dance was over he did n't take her back to where140 MILLBROOKshe was but stood and talked to her awhile and then left her standing alone . When supper time came , about eleven o'clock , Nell went down with William and Clara and Gabey and Sadie . Freda had gone with the Beckers . Ed was nowhere to be seen . The supper room was downstairs behind the bar . Dud Otis had disappearedtoo . They all sat down together at the long table . It was an oyster supper . Alf Becker always made the stew for dances . He made it in a washboiler . The oysters came in tin cans , and it took a lot for the dances , because Alf said he did n't want no stew that only had the trail of an oyster through it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stew she ever tasted in her life . And lots of it . Nobody could ever beat Alf at making an oyster stew . There were cabbage salad and hot biscuits , with cake and coffee for dessert . They only charged fifty cents for this kind of supper , and oysters were fifty cents a quart so they could n't afford to have much else . The women always donated the cakes . Of course William danced the supper dance with Clara , and Gabey danced with Sadie . Philip and Dan'l and all the younger fry played games out in the other room . When this dance was over William took Sadie asMILLBROOK 141partner for a polka and Gabey asked Nell Peters . He ' d only danced with her once . Nobody asked Clara . Adelaide said she saw Dud Otis come and stand by the door for a few minutes and then he walked in and sat down by himself . She said he staggered a little and Curt Wagner ( the floor manager ) went up and said something to him , but Dud did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing past him with Gabey , and Dud stood up , reeling a little , took hold of Gabey and pushed him away , and pulled Nell to him . " Get out ! " he said to Gabey . " Go and dance with your own girl and leave my cousin alone , damn you ! " And he whirled Nell out onto the floor and swung her round and round . Adelaide said she thought first Gabey was going after him , he was so mad , but he knew Dud had been drinking so he turned and walked off into the back room . Besides , they were all so flabbergasted to hear Dud call Nell " cousin " they could n't even think . ( When Adelaide told this I suddenly remembered the time I saw Nell comingfrom the old cemetery with a shawl over her head . ) The fellows Dud had brought with him were from another town and a bad lot , and the boys did n't142 MILLBROOKwant to get a row started . Adelaide said nobody knew just what to do . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about midnight and the parties always lasted till half past one , but after the dance with Nell , Dud went downstairs . Adelaide said Nell looked pretty worried . " My , " she said , " Dud acts awful , do n't he ? " The Dixons were sitting there with Big Jim and Adelaide and Clara , so Nell sat beside them . Gabey and Sadie were dancing . " He ' s mad , " Adelaide heard Nell tell Clara , " because I wo n't ever go to dances with him in Jackson . " Adelaide spoke up . " I did n't know you hardly knew him , " she said to Nell . " I did n't know you ever went to Aunt Het 's . " She said she knew very well that he did n't come to Lyde 's . She said Nell turned red and said , " Well  --  I do n't . Hardly ever . But I  --  met him in the road and he  --  asked me . " Adelaide said you could have knocked her over with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? Pretty soon Si Dixon asked Big Jim what he ' d think about going home , and Jim said two hours ago would of been too late for him , so they all got up and the men went to get the team , and the women to put on their things . MILLBROOK 143After that nobody seemed very clear as to what happened first , but it seems that Clara and Nell togetherwent and asked Gabey if Nell could n't ride with him and Sadie , because Ed was n't fit to drive . Adelaide told us that Sadie said afterwards she knew she was to blame because Gabey waited till her dance was over and then asked her if she would mind if Nell went home with them . Sadie said it made her mad , because Nell was always scheming to get hold of Gabey and he knew it , and somebody else could have squeezed Nell in to get her home . But she told Gabey all right , as long as they could get started right away . They all got downstairs about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Clara had gone , and Alf Becker had driven Freda and Ed home . The Dixons ' sleigh was out in front , and they and the Reeds got in just as Gabey drove up with his cutter . Sadie and Nell both stood there all bundled up , and Gabey got out to help them in when suddenlySadie said , " I ' m going with our folks , " and jumped into the sleigh and squeezed herself into the bottom with the boys . Everybody was so astonished that they were all in a daze , and just as Nell Peters was about to get into Gabey 's cutter Dud Otis came tearing out the door and pitched into Gabey. 144 MILLBROOKAdelaide said he used terrible language and gave Gabey such a blow he almost went over , but there was a pile of snow behind him where they ' d shoveled it off the walk and that sort of bolstered him up . Nell 's foot was on the edge of the cutter , but the horse eared and threw her back , and then Dud Otis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as Gabey got his balance , and landed another blow on Gabey 's face that made him reel . Big Jim had jumped out and caught Gabey 's horse and everything was confusion . Phil and Dan'l had got out and run up to Gabey , who hollered to them to get the hell out of his way . The women were screaming and the children crying , and all the men and boys in the bar had come rushing out . Dud Otis was swearing and telling Gabey what he ' d do to him for jilting one girl to insult his " cousin , " and that he 'd show him whether he could play fast and loose or not , and that he ' d make pulp of his head if he did n't go along home and leave Nell alone . And all the time Gabey was standing there getting madder and madder and swelling up , Cory said , like a turkey gobbler ready to fight . Then , without a word , Gabey sprang like a wildcat and hit Dud such a blow that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't through . He got to his feet , MILLBROOK 145blodd running from his nose , and blowing spit and blood out of his swollen lips , and came at Gabey again . Dud 's friends were trying to pull him away , and Philip and Dan ' . were both trying to get at him with fists and feet . Dud kicked at them viciously and hit Dan ' . in the stomach so hard he vomited . When Gabey saw Dan ' . down , and sick , he turned white as a ghost , Adelaide said , and she tried to get to him , but he shoved her away . Then Big Jim strode in ( someone else held the horse ) , but by that time Gabey had torn right through Dud 's friends ( who were n't too steady on their feet ) and given Dud a terrible blow on the jaw that sent him bang into a big window , and the glass broke . Then he turned to Nell . He took her by the arm and shoved her halfway into the cutter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Quick ! " He looked over at Sadie where she sat in Dixons ' sleigh . Then he said to the men that were holding the horse , " Let go ! " And they were gone like a shot . Adelaide said Dud got up streaming blood from his nose  --  she said the snow looked as if they ' d been butchering hogs  --  and hollered he wanted his horse , and he was going to break every so-and-so bone in Gabey 's body , and a lot more stuff , but his cronies had hold of him and took him away . Adelaide said it was a disgraceful affair and noth-146 MILLBROOKing like it had ever happened before , and would n't have now if it had n't been for Nell Peters . / She had n't any business to drag Gabey into trouble , and she blamed Clara , too , for going with Nell to ask Gabey to take her home . As for Dud Otis , the boys ought to have kept him out of the dance hall in the first place . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , ever happened in Millbrook . When Adelaide and Jim and the rest of them got home Gabey 's cutter was in the yard and the mare was in the stable and Gabey in bed . Adelaide said she begged Jim to let him alone but he would n't . She said she never saw Jim so mad in his life . He did n't get mad very often but when he did he was awful mad . He went right up to Gabey 's room and made him get out of bed . He asked him what he meant by treating a neighbor 's girl that way . " Insulting a nice girl like Sadie Dixon for a trollop like that one ! " Gabey said he did n't mean to insult Sadie . He ' d gone and asked her if she cared if Nell rode home with them and she said she did n't . " What ' d you want to take that hussy home for ? " thundered his huge father , towering over him . " What you mean messin ' around like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MILLBROOK 147It was awful cold and Gabey stood there in his long-legged underclothes and he shook , but he kept his temper . He told his father Nell did n't have any way to get home . Dud Otis wanted her to go home with him and she was afraid to . Big Jim snorted . " ' Fraid to ! " he mocked . " Well , I got a good mind to make you ' fraid to cut up like that again . I got a good mind to  --  " Adelaide said he raised his big fist and she thought he was going to strike Gabey . But Gabey ducked under his arm and grabbed his clothes . " Well , " he said , " you wo n't ! " And with that he ran downstairs . Adelaide said she ' d been all the time trying to calm Big Jim down , but you might ' s well try to calm a mad bull , so she followed Gabey downstairs and tried to talk to him . But he would n't talk . He put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his muffler around his neck and pulled down his cap ,  --  it was an awful cold night ,  --  and by that time it was much as two o'clock . Then he opened the door . " G'bye , Ma , " he said . " I ' 11 let you hear from me . " And he was gone . Adelaide said she went to the door and called  --  she cried terribly when she told about it  --  and tried to see which way he went , but it was too dark. 148 MILLBROOKBig Jim had gone to bed , and when she went and told him Gabey ' d gone , he just grunted and said , " Do n't worry  --  he 'll be back  --  soon as he ' s had time to cool his heels . " IXGABEY DID N'T COME BACKBuT Gabey did n't come back . Adelaide came to our house the next day , Saturday , and talked to my mother  --  and wept . It turned out later that when Gabey left home he went straight to the schoolhouse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shutter , so he went in and it was warm . He went to sleep in Sadie 's chair , at Sadie 's desk , and slept till he heard the seven- o'clock train whistle for the crossing . He got to the station just in time to catch it , and if there was n't Sadie Dixon on the same train going to Jackson too . And that was how we knew . She went right up and told Adelaide when she got home on the noon train , and Adelaide told us . Of course Sadie did n't know he was running away until she got home . She did n't even know he had slept in the schoolhouse . Sadie said she called , " Hello , Gabey , " but he just nodded at her  --  she said his eyes were swollen and his hair not combed and he looked awful . He went 150 MILLBROOKright on through to the smoker and never turned around . When they got to Jackson he came up to her and said :  --  " Sometime maybe you ' 11 know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was all . Of course Sadie wept and said oh , if she ' d only just gone along with them the way she ought to . And of course Adelaide was heartbroken , even though Big Jim did keep telling her Gabey ' d come back when he ' d had time to cool his heels , and she said she wished Nell Peters was in Tunket . That was a word she got from my father . She blamed Nell Peters more than she did Gabey , of course , and she was pretty bitter toward Clara too . Nell Peters was a big , blowsy , overgrown girl looking something like Clara except that she was n't as smart , and she had yellow frowzy hair , like her mother 's , while Clara 's was black . Nell had brown cow eyes , big and soft . She was about eighteen that winter , I think , and she did n't go to school . Girls as old as that did go to school , but she helped her mother in the notion store and post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the notion store and post office and neither of them liked to stay in back and do the work , and the house showed it . Nell was always running after Gabey ,  --  had been ever since she grew up ,  --  hollering to him when heMILLBROOK 151went by and making excuses to go up to Adelaide 's after supper to get him to go home with her . Sometimeshe would but oftener he would n't . Since Clara came it had been worse , because Clara was always asking her to come up in the evening and bringing her home to supper . Adelaide and Big Jim did n't disapprove of card playing the way some did , so they ' d play euchre and pedro , and Clara would play her a-cor-deen and Gabey the flute . All the young folks liked to go there , and Mr. Burton , the school principal , and his wife used to come too sometimes . They were older than the rest but still young folks . And then Fanny Akers and the younger boys , Philip and Daniel , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the cellar and a dish of friedcakes from the butt'ry . Adelaide loved company , and so did Big Jim for the matter of that , but he never entered actively into the fun . He ' d sit with his chair tipped back against the wall , chonking an apple with a pleased look on his face like a man does when his supper sets well and he ' s got nothing to worry about . His hair would be slicked back and he ' d have a clean shirt on ; he had neither moustache nor whiskers , but his jaw was alwaysdark because he only shaved twice a week . His chin was never dirty from tobacco juice the way152 MILLBROOKsome men 's were . Neither he nor the boys chewed tobacco and William was the only one that smoked . He generally smoked a pipe , but sometimes on Sundayhe would indulge in a cigar . They ' d play games  --  Up Jenkins , and Simon Says Thumbs Up . And they would sing . Jim bought Cory an organ very soon after they moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Sadie Dixon could play the organ good . She had a piano and she would let Cory and me drum on it . She taught us to play " Chopsticks , " and we could both play it at the same time . So Sadie would play the organ and Gabey the flute . They knew a lot of pieces together , but now Clara would come in with her a-cor-deen or a mouth organ , and it was grand . She loved to play the jew's-harp best , it seemed , because she could make the most noise with it . She would throw back her head , clamp her big even white teeth onto the little steel instrument , and sway her body to the swift , nasal strummingof the twanging tongue . Philip and Dan'l loved to have her play and they would get up and do a hoe-down on the bare kitchen floor while Gabey looked on and grinned . William did not seem to enjoy it . Especially when Clara got to going wild , bending and swaying , her eyes shining and teeth flashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until her face got red . Sometimes he would get up and go out of the room . Then when it was time to go home they ' d all start out together and Gabey would walk with Sadie as far as her house and Bud Dixon would walk with Nell and Judy Babcock . He liked to walk with Judy and sometimes he would go on with both girls and Gabey would wait till he came back . But other times Nell would contrive to get Gabey to go on home with her . Clara would ask her to send something back by Gabey or they would cook up some other scheme , but generallyhe would n't do it anyhow . Sadie 's house was nearest Adelaide 's , so if Gabey felt he had to go on with Nell he would try to persuadeSadie to go with him , but sometimes she would n't . She would run in the house and say good-night quickly and then Gabey would be mad . Gran'ma Reed came to spend the Friday after Gabey went , and the Aunts Hanner and Sophrony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adelaide told Cory she could come home with me from school at noon and after school . Big Jim and Adelaide would come over for Gran'ma Reed and the Aunts after supper . My father killed two good fat hens that had laid out their litters , and my mother had them scalded154 MILLBROOKand plucked and their insides out and hung up to cool , which they would do soon enough , for it was a good snappy day , two below zero , my father said , when he got up at five o'clock . The nails through the house had snapped and cracked during the night , the way they do when it gets awfully cold ; our fingers stuck to the frosty iron latch on the woodshed door , and the windows were thick with frost : beautiful forests of exquisite fernlike leaves with antlered deer peeringfrom them , strange and fascinating forms and patterns  --  lovely sights to behold , even if you stood shivering to dress while you studied them . I went happily off to school full of excitement on account of there being company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all the preparations for dinner that were going on . School , however , was the chief excitement . Every Friday afternoon we had a " spell-down . " Captains were appointed by the teacher or elected by fate  --  " Riar-Briar limberlock ; three-geese-in-a-flock ; oneflew-east , one-flew-west ; **30;5592;TOOLONG . O-u-t  --  out ! " The captains chose sides and we spelled down . That showed whether we had learned our lessons or not . For we learned to spell , not only from the spelling book ( Webster 's Elementary ) but from the readers : Sanders 's Fourth in our grade , the National FifthMILLBROOK 155Reader in the Big Room . Having been well drilled in both reading and spelling at home , it was a source of great pride to me to spell the class down , and to read fluently from any page in Fourth Reader , and also from the Fifth when the teacher occasionally allowedit on Fridays . Shrewishly haranguing " Mrs. Caudle 's Curtain Lectures " ; intoning with secret pride : " Hear the sledges with the bells  --  silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " Nevermore ! " The school was divided into three grades , primary , intermediate , and grammar , and I naturally fell into the middle class , being a little beyond primary and far below the grammar . My education , pursued in the most desultory manner , was of a most heterogeneouskind . Due to a close association with my father I was probably better versed in such unacademicsubjects as animal husbandry , processes of nature , weather signs and omens , simple horticulture , elementary astronomy , entomology , and allied sub-j ects than most youth , but what I did n't know of even the most elementary principles of mathematics was appalling . I could read fairly well and I was a good speller . Spelling was a game often practised at table between my father and mother and me  --  spelling everything in sight . Spelling was a game in school , too . But I was an atrocious penman . Al-156 MILLBROOKmost the very first day that I went to school in Millbrookthe teacher sent me to the blackboard to write a sentence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ' d know Deily ' d lived on a farm , would n't you ? Her writing looks just like hens ' tracks in the mud . " In the new school I had all new books  --  Sanders 's Fourth Reader , Webster 's Elementary Speller , Olney 's Geography , somebody 's Orthography , a historybook . And of course new copybooks  --  clean white-lined pages in a buff-colored cover . Teacher wrote a " copyline " at the top and we carried it down the page , each line growing a little less distinct than the one above , as familiarity and repetition engenderedcontempt . " Evil Communications Corrupt Good Manners ; Do Unto Others As You Would Be Done By , " and other moral and admonitive counsel . The readers and the spelling books were best . As a matter of fact the reader was also a spelling book , for all the hard and unusual words were laid out by themselves at the beginning of the piece and you had to learn to spell and pronounce them . No skipping over hard words in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sometimes " went through " your reader two or three times in a year ) you learned pieces and poems that you never forgot : " Benedict Arnold " and " The Capture ofMILLBROOK 157Major Andre " ; " Robert Bruce and the Spider " ; " The Drunkard 's Daughter " ( " Go see what I have seen  --  Go feel what I have felt " ) and " The Sword of Bunker Hill . " 01 ' Covell , in our lighter momentsat the farm , used to render this as a song with special emphasis on " the s-wo-rd of Bunker Hill . " There were dialogues also in the reader which were fun to read . You felt exactly like a play actor . When we got into the grammar grade we studied elocution . Nowadays it is called " voice culture " and you pay for it . And how we loved it ! Especially those of us who liked to show off . Force : " Half a league ! Half a league ! Half a league onward ! " Plaintive : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early dews were falling , Farre away I heard her song  --  " llsperate : " Speak softly : " All ' s hushed as midnight jet . " Crescendo : " And Sheridan twenty miles away ! " And so on through the gamut of expression , but itmade reading enjoyable . We may have overdone it , probably did ,  --  expression and gesture , but atleast we learned to read both to ourselves and aloud . So cold it was on this crisp winter 's day that even at noon , when Cory and I hurried down the crusty streets , the tiniest twig of every tree was still encased158 MILLBROOKin spangled shield , but even as we walked a little wind sprang up and a shining shower of silvered armor fell glittering at our feet . " Exactly such a day , " said Gran'ma Reed as we sat down to dinner , politely tucking napkins in at our necks and lifting the beautiful , deeply furrowed old Bellflower goblets to our lips , " that Jim was born . Winter of ' 36 , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , precisely as if none of us had ever heard her tell of those hard early days . " Gaberl " ( Gran'pa Gabriel Reed ) " had got the cabin built , but we did n't have any winders yet . Just greased paper . And the sleet broke ' em in . We had to hang up blankets . " Doc Snow did n't have time to get there so Gaberl went over and got Hetty Peters . The Peterses " ( that was Old Aunt Het ; she had been Miz ' Hiram Peters then ) " was our nearest neighbors  --  no , thank you , ' Li j er , no more chicken  --  well , just a lee-tle of the breast . The road was awful , crust so hard it cut the mare 's hocks till they bled . " We ' d lit the candles  --  though it was broad noon when Jim was born  --  and all of a sudden , I was layin ' there on the bed with the baby , when the blanket was shoved to one side and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cory and I had heard this story moreMILLBROOK 159times than it would be polite to say , we never failed to feel the goose pimples on our arms and a creeping at the roots of our hair . " He was a good Injun.  --  Yes , ' Miry , I 'll have another biscuit . They ca n't anybody on earth make such sour-milk biscuits as you can . The Pottawattomieswas all friendly enough , but terrible thieves and beggars . " Aunt Hanner was stewing . She had heard about the Pottawattomies before and there were other mattersof more moment to her . " Speaking of Indians , " she crowded in , " seems to me Gabey ' s acted worse ' n any Indian I ever heard of . " " It ' s the times , " returned Gran'ma Reed promptly , buttering another biscuit . " Boys did n't act that way when his father was young . They could n't . There was nothing but corduroy roads from here to Ann Arbor and all around . And boys did n't have money to fling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much . Now  --  " " ' Lifer , " Aunt Hanner cut sharply into the threateneddiscourse and pointedly addressed her brother , " what reason do you s'pose Gabey had for cuttin ' loose like that ? " " Huh ! " My father shoved back his plate , so indicatingthat he was through with the major portion160 MILLBROOKof his meal and ready for pie . " I do n't s'pose he had a reason . If he ' d reasoned he would n't of done it . He was just mad . " " Jim got mad at his father once , " Gran'ma Reed chuckled . My mother got up to clear away the table . Gran'ma Reed loved to talk , and you had to admit she was a good talker . And she had something to talk about  --  if you cared to hear of the Pottawattomies , timber wolves and wildcats , and the days when York Staters were pouring into Southern Michiganto build new homes in the oak openings and on the fertile lands . " It was when he ' s about twentyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n Gabey , then , " Aunt Sophrony interruptedmildly , " by a year . " " Yes , so he was . Well , he went over to see Adelaide  --  horseback  --  ' bout three mile , it was  --  and he stayed so late he thought he ' d take a cross-cut home and he got lost . Over back of our house  --  well , there ' s a swale still there , but it was a reg'lar cat hole then , before Gaberl got it ditched , and Jim 's hoss got mired and broke his leg . ' T was n't a very valuable hoss , but Gaberl was terrible mad . They went down and shot the hoss and then they come home and Gaberl went and got the hosswhip and he laid it on Jim 's shoulders  --  just once . Jim grabbed the whip  --  he ' s bigger ' n his father was  --  andMILLBROOK 161busted it square in two an ' flung it at his father 's feet and walked out . " " I thought you said they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Hanner twitted her , turning her plate with the mince pie on it around so she could cut the point off . " Well , " Gran'ma Reed was a little flustered , but not much , " it did n't amount to nothin ' . He only went over to Peterses ' and hired out and Gaberl went over next day and fetched him home . That ' s one thing , though , " she chuckled reminiscently , " that Gaberl did n't set down in the Ledger . " Here my mother took a hand . We had all heard about the Ledger , too . It seemed that Gran'pa Reed had been a great hand to keep a record of everyday happenings in a book he called " the Ledger . " He had started it the year he came to Michigan . Gran'ma Reed was ever mourning its loss . " I al'ays felt ' t when we come to clean out the log house and got every last thing out , we ' d find it , " she said many times . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house when Adelaide moved over into the new and no old ledger had been found . " He use ' to lay it up on the aidge of the logs under the roof , " said Gran'ma Reed , " but it must of been burnt up that time the house got on fire and we went over to stay with Het. " 162 MILLBROOKQuite a good many years before ,  --  before Cory and I , or even Philip , were born ,  --  the old log house had once caught fire , happily in the winter when snow was available , and not much damage was done , but while Gran'pa Reed was making necessary repairs they had all gone over to stay with Aunt Het . So there they sat and happily talked , and there we , the young ones , our dinner eaten , left them , regretfullylingering at the door until impatiently ordered to run to school . And there we found them when we returned in late afternoon , still speculating on Gabey 's fate , or what unlikely end was stored for loose-tongued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Bancroft over by the lake , who ' d tried to cut our Gabey out for a year and more . And , in more reticenttones , of Jennie Myers and how seldom she came home  --  now , and whatever possessed William to marry the way he had . They kept up the gossip throughout the hot savory supper at which a big dish of sauerkraut and pigs ' knuckles sat before my father , with potatoes in their jackets , while the high glass cake dish graced the centre of the table bearing a layer cake rich with oozing cream whipped to a froth and mingled with red raspberry jam . This would be no treat to my father , who hated mushy cakes , but it was compensa-MILLBROOK 163tion to Aunt Sophrony , who loved it  --  and had enduredthe kraut for its sake . Big Jim came , and Adelaide with him , soon after supper to take them home ; Adelaide , anxious , apprehensive , and full of grief , clung to her big , taciturn husband as a tangible object of faith in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It ' s too cold to leave the horses out and we ca n't stay long enough to put ' em up . Come , Cory , get your things . Bundle up your ears , Sophrony , it ' s pretty cold . G'night , Uncle ' Lijer  --  " " G'night , ' Miry  --  we 've had a mighty nice after-noon . " " G'night , Gran'ma  --  you get Jim to bring you over again soon . " " G'night , ' Li j er  --  I 'm goin ' to bake pies to-morrer . You happen along , mebbe I ' 11 have a punkin for you . " " Huh ! Got any cheese ? I ca n't eat punkin pie ' thout cheese . " " No , but Asy Brown ' s got a fresh one . Stop and cut yourself a hunk . " " G'night , Cory . " " G'night , Delly . See you in school to-morrow . " The sleigh creaks on the snow . The bells on the harness jingle , the echo growing fainter as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close it behind us . Good night . XTHE FACTS OF LIFEOL ' Doc Snow was past eighty , but he still rode around the county on his buckskin mare and cared for certain of his old patients who would have no one else . Gran'ma Reed was one of these , even though she regarded Dr. Babcock highly and approved of him for others in the family . But 01 ' Doc Snow had come to the Southern Michigan wilderness even beforeshe or the older Gabriel , and they had been friends ever since . Perhaps a little more than ordinaryfriends because Doc Snow 's wife had died soon after they came to Michigan and there was a legend to the effect that he had never married again because Gran'ma Reed ( who was Deborah Cooper then ) married Gaberl . Doc Snow lived in Spring Arbor but thought nothing of the few miles between there and Millbrookeven in winter . He came frequently and without excuse , as he did one day in March after Gabey went , his mare 's flanks coated with the heavyMILLBROOK 165mud of early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ostensibly he came to see how Gran'ma Reed , who had had a slight cold , was getting along , but Adelaide said it was as plain as the nose on your face that he ' d heard about Gabey and was anxious . He did n't ask a word , but they told him all there was to tell , and Adelaide said it seemed like her own father when he patted her shoulder and said , " Do n't you fret , Addie . He ' 11 come home . Boys may run away , but they do n't stay away from homes like this . " He was just going when Cory and I came from school . He wore a gray shawl pinned around his shoulders with a big safety pin , and earlaps under his high silk hat . He had on ar'tics and mittens , and when Philip brought his buckskin mare up to the door he put one foot in the stirrup and threw the other leg over the saddle as easy as Philip could have done . Adelaide stood in the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight as an Indian and held her lightly . " Addie , " he said , " I knew your Gabey 's grand- father  --  Gaberl Reed . He was fiery and some- times short-tempered , but he was loyal and good . He never , consciously , did a wrong thing in his life . And when he was in the wrong he was n't afraid to own up to it . Gabey ' s his spittin ' image . Don't166 MILLBROOKyou fret . " And wheeling his horse in a manner worthy of the young Indians from whom he had learned to ride in his youth , he cantered out of the gate and along the muddy road , his tall black hat bobbing rhythmically up and down against the drab background , the fringe on the folded shawl flapping at his back . About the middle of March , a postcard came from Gabey to Adelaide , addressed from Chicago . Lyde Peters read it first and went out on the street and told every man in sight . Nell threw a shawl over her head and ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Nell would go over and get Freda to come and tend the store he ' d take the card right out to Adelaide . And by the time Adelaide had got her card the whole town knew its contents by heart . " Dear Ma , " it said , " do n't worry about me . I have got a job taking care of horses in a livery stable . I sleep in the office on a lounge . As soon as I can save money enough I am going on to Iowa . They say there ' s good money there on farms . Give my love to Cory . Tell the boys to keep their noses clean . I was sorry to leave you , Ma . Gabey . " P.S. Chicago is a big place but it is awful dirty . " Not a word to his father , at which my own father'sface grew stern . William hitched up and broughtMILLBROOK 167Adelaide over to our house at once , as if we had not already heard the news . But the fact of Gabey 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He says he ' s going on to loway ! " mourned Adelaide . " And he do n't give any place where we could reach him . I wanted William to go on out there  --  to Chicago , to see if he could find him  --  fetch him home . But Jim says no  --  " " Father ' s right , " William interrupted . " Gabe 's almost twenty  --  and he ' s bull-headed . Maybe he ' 11 come back  --  maybe he wo n't . We just got to put up with it . " Clara walked downtown that afternoon , stopping at every door , in every store , complaining bitterly . She said William could n't think of a single thing but how to keep his mother 's mind off from Gabey . As for her , she was sick and tired of Gabey . She only wished William had gumption enough to run away . If he had any gumption he ' d get up and go to Detroit where he could be somebody . She did n't blame Gabey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk out on ' em too . Thus to Freda Calkins and Ed in the drugstore , hanging over the showcase where sweet-smelling boxes of cigars were kept and the fancy bottles of cologne and Florida water . She even bought a168 MILLBROOKbottle of cologne before she went out , Freda told us . She stopped at Aunt Hanner 's , but got small encouragement . Aunt Hanner had heard about this talk of getting William off to Detroit and was ready for her . " You better leave William alone , " she told her shortly , " if you know when you 're well off . William'sa country boy and he 'd be sick in the city . " " He would n't be sick if he had a good job , " Clara argued stubbornly . " He would n't work half so hard ' s he does here . " " He do n't work any harder , " countered Aunt Hanner , " than any other farmer , and if they like it it ai n't hard work . You 've got a good home  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better take holt and be satisfied with it . " Aunt Hanner was clean out of patience with her ; and after that Clara , apparently , kept her discontent more to herself , or at least we heard less of it , but she bided her time . March went and we heard no more from Gabey . The days grew longer . Each noon my father stood for a few minutes to watch the progress of the sun creeping north . He never complained of the winters even when age grew upon him and he could not combat snow and storm with the vigor of his youngerMILLBROOK 169years , but he looked for the turning of the earth upon its northern route with the greatest eagerness . " Sun 's getting so high now , " he would say hopefully , " snow Ill soon be gone . " His feet itched for the ploughed furrow and his fingers for contact with weed and seedling ; his blue farseeing eyes scanned the fields for the early crow ; his sharp ears were tuned for the first brisk cheerio of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the jay , the happy , faith-inspiring trill of the song sparrow . This particular year the spring brought special excitement , because the earth would yield unknown treasures for our pleasure and satisfaction . On the old farm we knew at what exact spot  --  almost betweenwhat grains of sandy loam  --  the pink crinkled noses of the rhubarb would appear , and we could have walked blindfold to the lower edge of the garden and put our hands on horse-radish , chives , sage , savory , and other perennial herbs and plants with utter precision . The currant bushes , gooseberry bushes , " rawsberry " vines  --  each of these had had its accustomedplace and the flowering and fruiting had been hailed each spring as one greets the best of friends after lonely absence . My father 's inspection of the new place had assured him that a few years would bring it to perhaps an even greater state of perfection than our old farm. 170 MILLBROOKOf course he was an old man now  --  or so , according to years , he would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now he gave his attention to the planting of trees , shrubs , vines that might not fruit within his lifetime . He had been studying the catalogues for new developments in the horticultural field , comparing what he already knew to be in the ground with what he thought desirable . His order had gone in  --  and by the middle of April he had plants up in his hotbed and his cold frame ready . Already we had had fresh , strong , stout horse-radish root and crisp sweet parsnips from the old farm where my father had reserved the privilege of gathering them , and to which we had made a visit as soon as the frost was out of the ground . Sometime in April Adelaide had a letter from Gabey . She let us read it . He said , in substance , that he was working in the biggest livery stable in Chicago , but that he might be sent to Burlington , Iowa , with a carload of horses . He said he had been over to see the stockyards and it had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stockyards and it was worse than Becker 's slaughterhouse when the wind was right . He said he went to a nickelodeonsometimes , but nobody knew what that was except William . William said there was one in Jack-MILLBROOK 171son and it was something like a stereoscope most everybody had in their parlors , except you turned a crank and you could actually see people move and do things . Gabey said he had been to the Lake to see the boats , but he did n't say where he lived or whether he was homesick . He told Adelaide to write him General Delivery because he might be going west any time . He asked her to tell him how they all were and how many calves there were , and lambs . He sounded homesick . Adelaide wrote him and begged him to come home , but he did not come . My father planted his garden , his field of potatoes , and another of sweet corn . Also , popcorn . He set out young peach and cherry trees , planted roses and other flowers . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in town . Then , late one afternoon , about the middle of May , Clara came bouncing into our house quite out of breath . She was plainly excited . Her face was red , her hat was crooked , her eyes burned . She unbuttonedher coat , took off her mittens , and twisted her hands . " I got to tell you something ! " She sat close to my mother , who was cutting cold potatoes to warm172 MILLBROOKfor supper , her knees almost touching . " It 's about Nell . She 's  --  my God , Aunt'Miry , she 's got herselfknocked-up ! She says it 's Gabey . She says that 's why he ran away . " My mother drew back , shocked , startled , dismayed , mingled fear and disgust on her face . " Hush ! " she said sharply . " Ca n't you see Delly Is here ? " Clara looked at me , surprised , evidently quite unaware of my presence up to now . " Well , " she said , rather sullenly , " she 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what you mean , " my mother told her sternly , and ordered me peremptorily to put on my things and go outdoors . She said it as if I were to go outdoors for the purpose of purification . So I went outdoors . I found my father , and after we had examined the condition of the beehives , from whence there was some slight activity in the warm sunshine , we went to the barn . Rosy , the gentle red-brown cow , would freshen any day . We stood looking at her , my father rubbing the roots of her horns with a corncob as she loved him to do , when suddenly , without intent , without volition of my own , my tongue burst forth :  --  " Pa , what 's it mean to be knocked-up ? " If a man can be said to " freeze " as a pointer does , MILLBROOK 173my father froze . The corncob rested in a stiffened hand until Rosy shook it off . He glanced at me , and away . " Who 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " She just told Ma that Nell Peters was knocked-up . " The light was dim in the stable . It was darken- ing outside . My father 's face underneath his old felt hat looked very strange  --  green , like the light when there is going to be a storm . For a moment he stood very still and I was fright- ened . Not frightened of him , but unreasonably , and in some obscure way , frightened for Gabey . Then my father moved and seemed to loosen in his bones and grow old . He leaned against the stanchion and pointed at Rosy . " Rosy 's going to have a calf , " he said . I nodded , wondering . We all knew Rosy was going to have a calf . Cows had calves every spring and sheep had lambs and hogs had pigs and horses had colts . That was common knowledge to all farm children . No- body told us anything about it . We just grew up , knowing . " That 's what it means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at him . Slowly the thing began to take form , but vaguely . We  --  Cory and I and other children  --  knew that when people got mar-174 MILLBROOKried they had babies . Women went to bed to have them . Other women came in . The doctor too , generally . Beyond that there had been little curlosity , practically no speculation . It was some kind of natural law  --  just what , we hardly questioned . But now  --  The thought formed . " But Nell Peters ai n't married . " " No , " said my father miserably . In later years I could understand the suffering he must have undergonein that dim , musty stable smelling of manure and hay and urgent udders ; how like thunderation he must have wished it were my mother thus pinioned under the questioning eye of dawning womanhood . But nobly he stood his ground . Valiantly , and characteristically , he met the enemy and did a noble best to make it his . " No , " he said , " she ai n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When women have babies and they ai n't married , they 're sinners . " This was not an altogether incomprehensible decree , for a step from Nell Peters 's common philanderingto sin seemed not a far cry  --  but what sin ? " But "  --  we were in for it now and might as well finish  --  " she said , Gabey 's the one . ' Wha 'd she mean , Pa ? " For a split second I thought he might strike atMILLBROOK 175me  --  he who had never laid an angered finger upon my flesh . His eyes burned through the shadows . His white face blazed . When he spoke it was with a forced gentleness . " When we want a cow to have a calf , " he said bluntly , " we put her to a bull . If you do n't know what that means  --  you will . When a woman has a baby she has been put to a man . It 's right and good and the way God meant it  --  when you 're married . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lying bitch ! " If he had forked the patient cow with the shiny pointed tines imbedded in the hay , if he had cursed my mother or staggered , drunken , inside the gate , as Ed Calkins rolled into his , I could not have been more horrified or scared . He sprang away from the stanchion where he had been leaning as if thirsting for violence , and strode from the barn . I followed in his furious wake and entered the house . Clara had gone . My father snatched a milk pail from the shelf . " Come out t ' the barn , " he said to my mother , and they went . I do not know what they said . When my mother came in she said , " I do n't want you to say one word about what Clara told . There 's no truth to it  --  at least to part of it . When there 's anything to tell , I Ill tell you . " XILYDE AND NELLWHAT would have happened if Nell Peters had not confided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a confidence , one can not say . But Nell had admitted her plight and Clara had run , bursting with the news , to my mother . My mother , confused , bewildered , and torn with apprehension for Gabey , who was her favorite amongst Adelaide 's brood , and for Adelaide and Big Jim , upon whom the blow would fall with stunning force , was immediately filled with remorse at not having tried to shut Clara 's mouth . " I ought to ' ve told her not to dare repeat that story , " she said to my father as they sat before a hardly touched supper table . " It 'll kill Adelaide . " " No , " said my father stonily , his anger still showingin his smouldering eyes , " it wo n't kill Adelaide . She ai n't that kind . But Jim 's likely to take Nell Peters by the neck and shake the britches off her . And he ought to . " 180 MILLBROOKStrangely , neither of them seemed to have placed the slightest credence in Nell 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our ears of any vengeancebeing visited upon Nell , nor , for several days , did it appear that the tale had gone beyond Clara 's first telling . A week passed . Adelaide came to see us , her face , always until of late so serenely fair , now drawn with lines pulling at lips and cheeks , and talked of Gabey . But she knew nothing of Nell 's plight and from Gabey they heard no more . Then , late one rainy night the very last of May , William came storming into town . Clara 's loose tongue had got the better of her discretion and in the privacy of their room she had told him of Nell 's conditionand of the blame placed upon his brother . William , a man given , like his father , to slow speech but prompt action , had , it seems , risen from the bed without a word , deaf to Clara 's pleas and protestations , put on such of his clothes as lay at hand , and gone , hot-footed , silent and swift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bed , as might have been expectedat so unseemly an hour ( it was nine-thirty ) , but at a peremptory knock Lyde appeared . The version I have of what took place was Lyde 's own as repeated to my mother . William went straight to the point , and if LydeMILLBROOK 181had not already been apprised of her daughter 's unhappycondition , she now learned of it in no mincing terms . William demanded Nell . " She ' s sound asleep , " Lyde told him , amazed . " What on earth you want of her this time of night ? " " You get her out , " thundered William , thrusting himself inside the door . " And dam ' quick . " Too surprised to argue against the cold fury of the young voice and the steely authority of his eyes , Lyde went upstairs , aroused her daughter , helped her , both of them trembling , into some clothes , and followed her downstairs . She said she was scared to death Uncle John Nevil would wake up and want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s gettin ' pretty deef and never heard a sound . William asked for no privacy . He confronted Nell with a stony countenance and proceeded with his errand . " What ' s this story you been telling Clara , " he demanded flatly , " about Gabey ? " Nell dropped her head , glanced sideways at her mother , and sulked . " Out with it ! " shouted William . " And see ' t youtell the truth . You ' re in the family way , are you ? " Lyde told my mother she thought she ' d drop dead . She fell into a chair and stared at Nell . All of a182 MILLBROOKsudden , she said , she knew it was true . She said she ' d of thought she would of saw it before , but she never dreamed . " Come on , " said William , sticking his jaw out and looking so ugly Lyde said she was afraid of him . " Is that the truth ? " After a while Nell mumbled , " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to blame for it , too . And now he ' s run away  --  the white-livered skunk ! " William stood so still Lyde said you ' d have thought he ' d turned to stone . He just stared at Nell for a long time , and then he said , " If Gabey ' s to blame for your  --  nasty mess , and then run away , he is a white-livered skunk . But your saying so do n't make it so . You 've told lies ever since you could walk and , so help me God , I believe you ' re lying about this . And if you are  --  " " Well , I ai n't , " Nell said , looking at him impudently ( even Lyde admitted Nell was impudent ) , " and if you can fetch him back I ' 11 face him with it . " " I ' 11 fetch him back , " said William grimly , " if he do n't come back himself , and you can face him with it . But  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his family ' s going to take your word for it . And you keep your goddam ' mouth shut about Gabey . " With that he flung out and slammed the door . But whether it was Nell who did n't keep herMILLBROOK 183mouth shut , or Lyde who kept hers too wide open , the story was soon out . A girl " in trouble " was probably not an entirely unique event in Millbrook , although in all the years of my childhood and youth , Nell Peters was the only one whose " disgrace " was ever brought to light . That it was a disgrace unequivocal and final is fact , not prejudice . A girl who allowed such intimacies exposed herself to criticisms which no decent person could countenance , and certainly no man would ever marry her  --  unless her partner were compelled to do so . Men did not " respect " a girl with whom they could becometoo familiar , and as for one who had been intimate with a man  --  well , she was an outcast from society and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a pariah ; her child was a bastard ( the word was whispered ) , and other children whittled their forefinger at him and would not play with him . Such a woman could neither marry nor find work . No respectable woman would employ her . Who knew into what evil she might lead one 's sons , brothers  --  even , possibly , one 's husband ? Her only hope was in her mother 's home  --  a sanctuary in which to hide her shame . Girls of her own acquaintance would not even speak to her  --  as Nell Peters was shortly to learn. 184 MILLBROOKSadie Dixon crossed the street in order not to meet her , and we crossed with her . Jennie Myers nodded to her when they came face to face , but made no further recognition . The women stared coldly  --  and surreptitiously  --  and looked away . The men leered . The boys turned red and snickered . Nell never showed herself in the notion store or post office . The town took sides . Forums were held at the meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missionary Society . And around the stove in the back part of Asy Brown 's store . Probably in the front room of the tavern and in the barbershop . It was a dull time of year anyway . Farmers had few subjects  --  freshening cows , seed potatoes , farrowing sows , all threadbare themes . National affairs were at low ebb . Millbrook was strongly Republican and all was as it should be . Saturday nights at the store in early May would have been dull except for gossip . And so the tongues wagged . They took the Peters family apart , looking for traits that might account for Nell 's dereliction . Lyde herself , it seemed , had been pretty wild in her youth . Miz ' Alf Becker , who had been girls with Lyde , said there ' d been quite a good deal of talk about her and a feller that worked over to Hanover and he 'd left the country pretty sudden . Nobody ever heard of him again and right after that Lyde married JoeMILLBROOK 185Peters . And none too soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby  --  the one that died  --  they said was a seven months ' baby , but  --  And so on . They hauled poor Joe Peters out of his patriotic silence to recall a certain time when he had come home from Jackson  --  he and Mert Hesker and some other cronies  --  drunk as a lord and had actuallytold Lyde that if she did n't like the way he done she could lump it and as soon as she liked . And Lyde said Nell was just like her father . And her grandfather too . They even laid some blame at Old Aunt Het 's door  --  the way Joe was brought up and all , his father and mother not speaking together for days . What could you expect ? Indeed , they seemed to find plenty of hereditary cause for Nell 's lapse from grace , but , even so , such excuse in no way modified their censure or invited charity . Nell was a trollop and must take the consequences of her acts . The wages of sin was death . The sins of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four generation , but that was their hard luck . The fact that Gabey Reed was named as partner in the crime had them floored . The Reed boys had never been " wild . " They did not drink . They had , after the way of country boys , gone to school186 MILLBROOKwinters until they outgrew the desks , and then they had worked hard and steadily at home . Philip and Dan'l were still in school , and Dan'l talked about going to Jackson another winter and then to Ann Arbor . He wanted to be a doctor . William had always been as steady as a plough horse , so utterly reliable and dependable that his sudden marriage to Clara had been doubly amazing . Gabey had shown the most spirit of any of them , to be sure . But he was good . He was livelier than William . He was even something of a cut-up at times , clowning at the box socials and surprise parties . He could dance better than any boy in the country ; he dressed more stylishly ( he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sewing machine , because tight pants were fashionable and he wanted his tighter than anybody else 's . Big Jim , seeing him go out in them , said it would be a mercy if they did n't split before he got home ) . But even so , Gabey was a good boy . All Adelaide'sboys were . Besides , said the Ladies ' Aid , when  --  where  --  never putting their thoughts into active words , but stumbling foolishly , shifting their eyes . Gabey had n't even went with Nell . He never took her anywhere  --  and as for setting up with her , why , heMILLBROOK 187never had  --  once . ( The town would have known if he had ! ) Still  --  did n't he leave Sadie Dixon to go home with her own folks from that dance and take Nell home ? Yes , but , good gracious , that was only the last of February ; this must have happened  --  well , they said she was four months along anyway . And , why , that ' d bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , somewhere along November  --  December . That was after Clara came and of course Clara was foreverhaving Nell up there nights and asking Gabey to take her home . Nell said so herself and plenty had heard her . Clara had tried hard enough to cut Sadie out with Nell , but she had n't worked it . Unless  --  well , if this was true  --  Still , it could n't be true . And yet  --  Nell would n't lie about that , would she , and , matter of fact , she had n't gone with any of the other boys for over a year ( not since Pat Worthy  --  a nephew of Alf Becker 's  --  had visited there , but Pat was only at Becker 's for a couple of weeks ) . My mother refused to be drawn into it . My fathersaid the less you poked a stinkbug the less he stunk . The day after William 's tempestuous visit LydePeters came to our house overflowing with her own188 MILLBROOKtragedy and Nell 's , indignant at William and seethingwith bitterness because Gabey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to the house for a drink of buttermilk , made a quick exit at the rear door when Lyde appeared at the front . When he came in at supper time he reeked of manure , which he had been hauling from the stables . My mother complained of his unsavory odor ; but , said he , he did n't smell no worse than he would of if he ' d stayed around and listened to Lyde . My mother had by this time given up trying to shield me from the prevailing taint of pitch , but she did suggest , when Lyde broke down and began to wail over the disgrace that had been visited upon her , that I might like to take some fresh-cooked rhubarb over to Poor Elviry . By clever and unostentatious dallying , however , it was possible to get a fairly good understanding of Lyde 's attitude toward the affair , which seemed to be one of grievance that the should be brought to shame by her own daughter . " What have I ever done , " she cried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to deserve such a fate as this ! I 've toiled and moiled to be a good mother to her . I ' ve sacrificed and sacrificed  --  " MILLBROOK 189 " I do n't think sacrifice has got a thing to do with it , " my mother cut in ruthlessly . " It ' s either the way a girl ' s brought up or it ' s in her blood . " But whether Lyde Peters saw reason to place any responsibility for her daughter 's weakness upon either of these conditions , she did not say . She only continued to weep , rocking herself hysterically back and forth , and to moan and bewail her own miserable lot . " And what ' m I going to do with her ? " she wailed . " I ca n't have her around  --  folks comin ' into the shop  --  and Uncle John Nevil so mad he could chew nails . Says no such thing ever happened in his fambly  --  " " Well , this is his fambly , " my mother reminded her sharply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuss . You got to go through with it . All of you . " Suddenly Lyde broke into a tirade against Dr. Babcock . She and Nell , it seemed , had gone over early that morning to see him . " I ' d ought to ' ve known better ' n to ask him if he could n't do something , " she said bitterly . " Fussy old thing , you ' d think nobody in his fambly ever made a slip in their lives . Prob'ly if the truth was known  --  " My mother looked up  --  she was sitting in her rocking chair before the window in the kitchen where she sewed , mended , peeled apples , or did190 MILLBROOKother sitting chores . She looked up , surprised , her eyes widening . " Dr. Babcock ! " she repeated . " What could he do ? " Lyde looked mysterious , and dropped her voice . " Well , " she said speculatively , " I do n't know as ' t would be safe to do anything  --  now  --  she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done something . Only he says he would n't , not if she ' d a died . He swore at me . He said Nell was n't the first loose-footed , good-for-nothing girl that had asked him to do her dirty work for her , but that he was n't that kind of a quack . " She said he fairly hollered and shook his fist and all but ordered them out of the house . However , she said craftily , she knew there was doctors  --  she ' d heard there was one in Jackson  --  that had helped girls  --  " But how could he help them ? " My mother 's voice was full of shocked surprise , and just then she saw me  --  ineffectually turning the pages of a book in the next room . " I thought you ' d gone ! " she called sharply . " Hustle along now , and when you come back I want you to do something else . " Thus cunningly providing against further eavesdropping in case her visitor were still there upon my return . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim as long as possible from the story which he knew would add the agony of shame to the grief they already felt at Gabey 's absence . As soon , however , as village tongues began to wag , he realized the story would come to their ears , and decided to break it to them himself . Adelaide came straight to our house when he had done . She seemed always to feel the need of my mother 's stout and practical understanding , and to long for " Uncle ' Lijer 's " unspoken sympathy . She brought Cory with her , and my father , instantly upon her arrival and sensing an impending storm , invited us ( Sunday morning it was ) to go with him to the woods across the meadow where he had seen violets in bloom . Cory demurred on account of a headache  --  she could always be counted on for a headache in the face of undesirable errands . " Coffee , " declared my mother upon such occasions . " Strong enough to192 MILLBROOKfloat an egg and so much sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has a headache . That girl never ' 11 live to be a grown woman if they do n't quit humorin ' her . " At any rate , Cory had no present interest in violets , and I , torn between love for an excursion with my father and the desire to stay and hear what Adelaide had come for , found the matter settled . I could not go and leave Cory . " You girls go ' n the other room , " suggested my mother cannily , " and  --  and look at the album . " Probably sensing our lack of enthusiasm , due to the fact that the album was familiar territory to us , she amended her proposal by saying , " Or  --  go out on the porch , why do n't you ? Yes , go out on the porch . " So we went on the porch and the door was closed . Cory , however , was seldom if ever excluded from family conclave , and , now miraculously relieved of the headache , was fully acquainted with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William , she said , had asked his father to wait a minute as he rose from the breakfast table , and also told the boys to sit still . " You may ' s well hear this straight , " he said , " as to get it from somebody in the barbershop . You ' re to keep your mouths shut , " he commanded the boys . MILLBROOK 193 " And you too , " he told Fanny Akers . " No matter what you hear . It ai n't nice and I hate to tell it . Nell Peters is going to have a baby and she says Gabey ' s to blame . " Cory said her father turned as red as the gills of the old turkey cock , and started to jump up , but Williamheld up his hand . " Wait a minute , Father , " he said , but Cory said she thought her father was going to choke and her mother looked as if she ' d die . Cory said she did n't even think of the boys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Clara and how he had gone down there Friday night and Nell had stuck to it . He said he did n't believe it  --  and none of them would believe it , but they ' d got to get Gabey home . Cory said her mother put her head down on the table and they were all scared because not a sound came from her . Then William put his hand on Adelaide 's shoulder and said , " Do n't worry , Ma , it 'll be all right soon ' s we get Gabey home . " ( Apparently the only thing that mattered to them in making things all right was to clear Gabey . ) Then he said , " Ma , where ' s that letter from Gabe  --  about the livery stable ? " The letter was brought , read and studied , but it shed little light on Gabey 's whereabouts . The only194 MILLBROOKclue was that he worked in a livery stable , " the largest one in town , " and that it was somewhere near the stockyards . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago to try to find him . It would be , Adelaide said , like looking for a needle in a haystack , but Gabey must be found if possible . " You fetch him back , " Big Jim said , " and if he ' s guilty , by cracky , he ' 11 marry the girl or I ' 11 lick the hide off him . " " If he ' s guilty , " William told him coldly , " he ' 11 marry her without being licked . He would n't have run away if  --  but he ai n't guilty . I know he ai n't guilty , but we 've got to get him back . " Fanny Akers said William was so mad that when he milked , the cows would n't give down . William was to go on Monday , and Adelaide spent the rest of Sunday brushing his suit and washinghis best shirt with the pleated front . He blacked his best shoes and got out the straw valise Clara had brought  --  the Reeds had never traveled , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his extras in . It was a bad time to leave , right in plantingseason and with Gabey gone anyway , but no one thought of that . The two younger boys would stay out of school , and Big Jim had hired an extra man . MILLBROOK 195Nobody heard from William for two days . Then he came home  --  on the evening train of the third day . He looked gray and dusty and worn . He had not found Gabey . He found the place where Gabey had worked only to learn that he had gone the week before with a man who was taking a carloadof draft horses to Burlington , Iowa . The man had written that Gabey had gone on west from there with a stock man  --  to somewhere in Kansas , but he did n't know where . Nothing further could be learned , so William came home . The city , even in two brief days , had utterly wearied and disgusted him . He had not been able to sleep because of the noise . He hated the smells . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his stomach was that of the livery stable . His feet were sore . He said he was more tired than he would be after a week in the hayfield . He said so much about the city that Clara , apparently , for the time at least , stopped dinging about going to Detroit . In fact , Clara was in general quite subdued . She seemed to feel that in some way she was blamed for Gabey 's share in the tragedy . She had tried to encourage an intimacy between Nell and Gabey , and she did not know how far that intimacy had gone. 196 MILLBROOKClara and Fanny Akers discussed details hungrily and without regard to Cory 's presence . Cory repeatedsuch conversations to her mother , and Adelaidecame to our house . Too honorable to make trouble between William and his wife , she would not appeal to him to silence Clara ; neither would she take a chance of antagonizing Clara by talking to her about it . So Clara and Fanny held surreptitious conversations , but neither of them dared defy village conventions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shrunk into the depths of her padded chair . She adored Gabey and could not bear the thought of his defection or of his being brought to justice . " I ' d ruther he stayed West , " she said sadly , " then to be fetched back to marry that trollop . " Big Jim worked . Work was a panacea . Daylightfound him in the fields . So did dark . Noon brought him in barely long enough to eat . " He ' s going to kill hisself , " Adelaide mourned . " He do n't eat nothing the way he used to . He ' s thin ' s a bed slat , and he do n't say a word . He just works like a dog . " William and the boys kept him faithful company . Work seemed the only surcease from festering anxiety . The boys seldom went to the village at night . They took themselves off to the little lake back ofMILLBROOK 197the house after work for an hour 's fishing in the dusk or to swim . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way they used to do . Sometimes the four of them , William , the boys , and Ock Ramer , the hired man , would pitch horseshoes , but they all acted as if they were ashamed to be seen . Even Ock stayed with the boys as if thus to show his loyalty and sympathy . And to avoid questions . Everybody was sorry for them . Lissy went to see Adelaide and took her some slips or roots or something Elviry had sent . Even Etty Myers went up to see Adelaide  --  and much good it done her , she said . Adelaide never mentioned Gabey or Nell Peters either . The Methodist minister came over from Concord to condole with the Reed family  --  but found only Adelaide to receive him . Gran'ma Reed shut her door . The men were all in the fields , and if they had n't been would have soon gone there anyway when they saw him coming . Clara happened to let him in and , having called Adelaide , stayed out of curiosity . The Methodist minister , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned of their unhappiness , simply came to condole  --  but in a mannerwhich Adelaide 's raw nerves could not bear. 198 MILLBROOKClara gave my mother her version of the visit . " I thought Miz ' Reed ' s going to fly at him and tear his shirt off ! " ( Clara had never called Adelaide " Mother . " ) Adelaide ! Always the most imperturbable of women ! " What on earth ' d he do ? " my mother , astonished , wanted to know . " Well , " Clara seemed to consider what he had done so to arouse this unusually tranquil woman , " he just talked to her . And prayed . " " What ' d he talk about ? " persisted my mother . " He talked about the prodigal son  --  " " Mercy ! " exclaimed my mother . " That wouldset Adelaide off . Gabey ' s no prodigal son ! " That was exactly what Adelaide said a little laterwhen the Reverend Mr. Draper went to see her . She told us about that herself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know him very well , " she said , " but I was n't going to stand it from nobody else . I told Reverend Draper if he so much as mentioned the prodigal son I ' d put him outdoors . I told him Gabey was no prodigal and he laughed  --  though he did look a little flabbergasted  --  I was so fierce  --  and said he had n't any idea of talking about the prodigal son or anything else except what a good boy Gabey is . MILLBROOK 199He said they did n't believe a word of the story and he hoped and prayed that Gabey would soon write or come home . " I do not know whether either minister went to see Lyde and Nell or not . It was a delicate situationand perhaps they felt that interference or extendedsympathy would be superfluous . Neither do I know who , if any , amongst the women of the town showed any friendliness or neighborliness towards them . How much the men talked and gabbed about Nell Peters and Gabey I had no way of knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand around even for a minute where they were gathered . My own father never mentioned the matter ; neither , of course , did Dr. Babcock or the Reverend Mr. Draper . In our hearing they talked about potatoes fetching a dollar a bushel in April . And Jackson was going to have streetcars ! Gosh a'mighty , gettin ' up in the world , hey ? The tracks were pretty well laid and the street between the tracks was being repaved with cedar blocks . There was even talk of electric lights ! Some said before another year they ' d have electric lights right on the street . The Mayor said he was going to light his store in the fall and put a big lamp right out in front ! 200 MILLBROOKHousecleaning had to be attended to and that took our minds off gossip . The air was full of dust from beaten carpets  --  ingrain , Brussels , rag . Curtainsswung from lines on sunny days ; clean papers were put on butt'ry shelves ; old vegetables were raked from cellar bins , dirt floors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cellar walls , hen coops , and privies were whitewashed . Over back-yard fences the women discussed householdtopics . Miz ' Alf Becker had bought a new ingrain carpet for her parlor , bright green and red  --  twenty-five cents a yard . Good quality , too . Fanny Akers bought calico for a new dress  --  twelve yards for thirty-six cents . Real pretty , brown with a green dot in it . Clara went to town , visited Miz ' Esty , and came home with cloth for a new dress , blue cashmere , eighteen yards of it , with drill and cambric for lining , whalebone for the basque , three dozen glass buttons , brush braid for the bottom , ruching for the neck and wrists , and passementerie to trim it with . She was going to have Hat Webster make it . But she was mad at Miz ' Esty and declared she would never go there again . She said Miz ' Esty meddled in her business . She said Miz ' Esty asked her if she liked farming any better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hated it and she ' d never beMILLBROOK 201satisfied till she got William off the farm . She said she hated the very smell of a farm and she hated cows and milk and she wished she ' d never see a churn again as long as she lived . What she was maddest about was that Miz ' Esty lit into her and told her she was an awful fool . She told her that she had married into one of the best families in the state , and one of the finest boys ever lived , and if she knew which side her bread was buttered on she would go home and keep still . " Look , " she said , " at the money William has gave you to buy a handsome dress with . He could n't do that , " she told her , " if he worked in the city . " Clara said that was the silliest thing she ever heard . She could have forty dresses if she lived in the city . She said she did n't thank Miz ' Esty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she ' d show ' em . Then a letter came from my Grandmother Bogardussaying she was coming to visit us in June . This was a great event in our lives , for she came only at rare intervals . For one thing Grandmother had never approved my mother 's marriage , although that in itself had not , of later years , kept her away , for she grew to be quite fond of my father in spite of the aloof and somewhat bumptious manner in202 MILLBROOKwhich he carried himself toward her  --  a manner born partly of his realization of her disapproval and partly of a childish desire to show her that he thought the Thompsons were quite as good as the Bogarduses any day . Now Grandmother was coming to see us . And whatever my father 's feelings might be toward her she had her virtues as a visiting ancestor . In the first place she brought excitement . She was a delightto behold  --  fair of skin , blue of eye , benign of expression ( not too reliable ) , with a pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accustomed . She brought news , or gossip rather , that was news to us , of my mother 's relatives : Cousin Fred 's new job as flagman at West Detroit . Cousin Emmy was going to be married in the fall . To a doctor who was a widower . Grandmother hated to have Emmy marry a widower ( Emmy was twenty-six and had lived with Grandmother ever since her own mother died when Fred was born ) , but he was very successful , had a fine practice and a nice home . Emmy liked him and he would be good to her . She did not speak of love ; it would not have been in good taste . Grandmother also brought gifts , but these were neither distributed nor mentioned on this first eve-MILLBROOK 203ning . Her small hair trunk ( bound with brass straps ) and her carpetbag were taken to the spare room off the parlor , but her reticule she kept near by . There seemed to be nothing distributable in the contents of this ( any such lack being generously accounted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were her pretty little bottle of smellingsalts such as all ladies carried ( hers was of cut glass and oddly shaped , green in color , odorous with ammonia and lavender ) ; a small sewing case with tiny silver thimble marked " H. B. " ( my grandmother'sname was also Hannah ) ; a little memorandum with ivory covers and tiny pencil on a silken cord ; her lace-trimmed , perfumed handkerchief , and my grandfather'shuge gold-cased watch which she always carried . She had a small watch of her own on a long thin golden chain which was slipped into a pocket at her belt , but she never trusted it . No matter if , day after day , it checked to a minute with any other timepiece , she placed no reliance upon it , but alwaysopened the bag , took out Grandfather 's watch , opened the case , and gave the latter 's infallible decision . Supper , on the night of her arrival , was a ceremoniousaffair , for my mother had rather outdone herself to give the new home special grace in Grandmother'seyes. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that chicken ( as a matter of fact it was a nice plump yearoldhen ) would be any treat to Grandmother , who had fowls of her own , but chicken , except in freshmeatseason , was company meat . You could n't do any better by a guest than to give her chicken . And when my mother had fricasseed a tender fowl in good sweet butter and served it up with biscuits and gravy and mashed potatoes , you could n't get a bettermeal under any circumstances . It was a little too early for green peas ( the first mess was my father 's perennial and patriotic contribution to the Fourth of July dinner ) , but for greens there were chives cut up in a bowl with vinegar , salt , and pepper , and green young horse-radish and narrowdock leaves cooked with salt pork . Strawberries were ripe too  --  strawberries over which my father had stood in anxious urgency for days , watching with one eye the mounting flush upon their heartlike cheeks and with the other the skies for any menace to their perfection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related to contemporary odors such as clover , both blossomed and newly mown , and yellow cream , cooled in the dim stone-walled recesses of the cellar . Strawberriesand cream and a rich white cake which was a remembered favorite of my grandmother 's , forMILLBROOK 205which a lavish hand had beaten a pound of fine white sugar into a pound of butter with the whites of a dozen eggs added , and I do not know what else . I only know that it was of a texture so fine that the tongue caressed it , of such an odor that the nose regretted its passing , and hauntingly reminiscent of that vanilla bean which Gran'ma Reed carried in her pocket , and yet never so potent that one was sure whether it was the vanilla bean or some yet unlabeled redolence divined from mystic source . Grandmother was a woman who ate in a manner to bring joy to my father 's heart . She ate slowly , tasting each morsel to the full  --  introducing it cautiously to the lips , receiving it critically upon the tongue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved , the accepted tidbit was not hurriedly dispatched upon its now insensate journey , but was encouraged in procrastination , until the last sweet taste passed the palate 's nice perception , and all the delicate organsof food enjoyment stood in readiness for the next . Neither was my grandmother chary of her praise . She gave my father full credit for the excellence of his fruit and , although she had a garden of her own in which she took great pride , she did not hesitate to tell him that never had she seen such berries as206 MILLBROOKhis  --  a gesture which greatly furthered amicable relations . Grandmother also brought a message from my cousin Fred to William . Or rather to Clara , since Clara it was who had asked Fred for the information . " Fred said , " Grandmother told us , wiping her lips carefully on one of my mother 's very best napkins ( my father and I had common ones made from an old tablecloth ) , " to tell William that there was plenty of work around the carbarns now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come to Detroit Fred would take him to see some men he knew . But , " she added curiously , " what ' s William want a job in the city for if he ' s got as good a home here as you say he has ? " My father snorted and shoved his chair noisily back from the table . My mother leaned her elbows on the table and her face in her hands . " Oh , dear , " she complained , " now that 'll stir it all up again . It ai n't William that wants a job in Detroit . It ' s Clara . She used to live there and she do n't like it on the farm . " " What ' d she marry a farmer for then ? " my grandmother quite reasonably asked . " Nobody knows , " said my mother dolefully . " And what ' s worse , nobody knows what he wantedMILLBROOK 207to marry her for . She ' s nagged him ever since to leave the farm and go to town . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , " my grandmother broke in with an unmorallydecisive manner , " s'posin ' we do n't give him the message then . ' T is n't anything he wants .

" My grandmother , confronted with an irrefutable moral argument , conceded the matter to a higher tribunal of honesty , but that very evening when , after supper , Adelaide called with Cory , and Grandmotherdelivered her message to be relayed to the proper source , Adelaide , in almost exact imitation of my mother , threw her hands to her face and cried  --  as my mother had done :  --  " Oh , dear , that means  --  it 'll be all stirred up again ! I wish we did n't have to tell ' em . " Again my father 's derisive snort belittled the doubtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If William ai n't man enough to stand out ag'in that silly she-goat , she better lug him off and be done with him . " 208 MILLBROOKThe days of my grandmother 's visit were crowded with calls , visits , and visiting . She was , of course , unacquainted with our new neighbors , although Big Jim and Adelaide and the Aunts had come to see her when she visited us on the old farm . Aunt Hanner and Aunt Sophrony came the next day , Friday , and stayed to supper . Adelaide and Gran'ma Reed also came , but had to go home in time to get supper because Fanny was away and Clara could not be relied upon . Cory was to come with me from school . The ladies talked . The talk was still going on when Cory and I dashed breathless into the house and then unobtrusively drew our chairs as close to the little circle as we dared . The more nearly we maintained the appearance of other furnishings the less likely we were to draw undesirable attention . So long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquire considerable more information on general subjects ( and a great deal more entertainment ) than if they were openly inquisitive . Gran'ma Reed and my grandmother compared pioneer days , Gran'ma Reed telling of life here and Grandmother Bogardus of that almost a hundred miles away . Aunts Hanner and Sophrony contributedtales from their own early days in York State ,  --  a somewhat more civilized community , itMILLBROOK 209would seem ,  --  while Adelaide and my mother , being of lesser years and experience , politely listened . Some of the ladies sewed . Not all , for Gran'ma Reed was knitting and Aunt Hanner helped my mother hull strawberries for supper . Aunt Sophronyhemmed napkins . She must have had dozensupon dozens of them , for it was a favorite occupation . She loved fine linens and had chests of drawers filled with them . She made gifts of tableclothsand tea cloths and napkins to all the girls of her acquaintance when they got married . She once confided to my mother that she had a set half done for Jennie Myers when William so suddenly cooled toward her  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making these now for William against the day when he and Clara should  --  as the Aunts quite openly said they ought  --  set up their own home . My mother sewed only for necessity 's sake , but she was seldom idle , and now she sat with a basin of berries on her lap near Aunt Hanner , with a chair between them on which was a large blue bowl into which they both threw the finished fruit . They sat and talked  --  in their tight-fitting basques with many buttons , their full long skirts protected by full white aprons , their high-topped shoes , their ruches , brooches , breast pins , and thin old-fashioned wedding rings. 210 MILLBROOKA lacy , pretty cap covered the top of my grandmother'sdark head and tied beneath her chin with thin silk ribbons . Aunt Hanner and Aunt Sophrony used to wear caps , but no longer did . Hardly any of the old ladies in Millbrook wore them , partly becauseit was a style that had gone by , partly because they were more used to a sunbonnet or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeding poultry , herding a flock of contrary-minded young turkeys through the long wet grass , or holding the stubborn head of a sniffling young calf in a pail of milk . My mother said that my grandmother might have lived on a farm all her life , but so far as she knew she ' d never done more than look over the fence into the barnyard . They talked about neighborhood affairs , of food , of how wild strawberries made a rarer jam than tame ones , and of currant jelly , exchanging experiencesand rules in the fashion of contented , happy women . My grandmother 's interest was as keen as if she expected to settle down with them for the rest of her life ( presumably of great and undeterminedlength , although she was now well past eighty ) , and must get the details of her background laid in the least possible time . They told her about Old Aunt Het 's hermit-like existence on the lonely road beyond the buryingMILLBROOK 211ground ; of the wild , ungrateful , homeless youth  --  now man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ befriended and who was wasting her money , impoverishing her farm . They repeated what they knew of his meagre history and told , in awed and lowered tones , of his debasing association with Quint Sharpe , the atheist . Gran'ma Reed went back to when she and Hetty Peters had been young wives together in what was then a wilderness , how they had helped each other in childbirth , sickness , and death . They had shared receipts , food , patterns  --  life itself . And she told how for years now Aunt Het had not let Gran'ma Reed inside her door  --  a matter of grief and regret . They told my grandmother about Poor Elviry , her lingering illness , her patience , her sweetness , and her undying faith in a God who , if He meted out suffering , also held , as in the hollow of His hand , the future safety , happiness , and everlasting bliss of all those who had faith in His mercy . And of her husband Asy 's doglike devotion , his constant thoughtfulcare for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose lover had been killed at war and whose faithfulness to his memory had never failed . Of her tender ministrationsto Poor Elviry , and how Les ' Myers had tried212 MILLBROOKmore than once  --  though not lately  --  to shine up to her , but without avail . They agreed  --  and Grandmother with them , her cap strings fluttering with each bright nod of her head  --  that this was a pity , although proper and right , but hoped that  --  well , if anything should happen to Poor Elviry  --  and from there drifted into what was to Cory and me the gruesome  --  but fascinating  --  discussion of what Elviry had preparedagainst the day of her " laying out . " This was a topic not unknown even to our young ears . The subject of death itself was not avoided . People seemed to accept the fact of death as an interruptionto life with equanimity . They made as sure of a suitable repository for their bones as they did of a house to cover their living flesh . They did not avoid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and friends what should be theirs when they were " through with it . " And since the accoutrements of an official undertaker were not known and would have been scorned if they had been , they prepared and laid away , as the years crept upon them , a complete outfit with which to clothe the body for its last retirement . So now they , whose own eyes were often turned  --  with heroic acceptance  --  upon the shores of that Beulah Land in which they all believed , related withMILLBROOK 213the same sense of satisfaction that a bride would have for her wedding gear the fineness of Poor Elviry 's burial array . Then they compared personal matters . " I , " said Gran'ma Reed , " have had my things ready so long they 've yellowed . I keep ' em in a trunk in the attic and we must get ' em down and out on the grass to bleach . " " I , " said my Grandmother Bogardus , " went over mine just before I came away . They ' re in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows right where to lay her hand on ' em . I ' ve got drawers and a shimmy and a petticoat . I ' ve told Emmy to lay me out in the best black silk dress I have . I always keep an extra one on hand . " Gran'ma Reed looked embarrassed and perhaps a little envious . She had never had a black silk dress . Time and again she had said she meant to have one before she died , but the time never seemed right . Aunt Sophrony said that she had had a complete outfit from time to time but she ' d always dipped into it when she got short of something and she did n't know whether it was all right at the present or not . Aunt Hanner " pht 'd " and said it was all she could do to cover her nakedness while she was alive without worrying about when she was dead . Somebodyelse could worry about that . My mother and214 MILLBROOKAdelaide kept still . They had not reached the age when their thoughts turned to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The younger generations were already beginning to find their chief concern in the present , not in the past , nor in a future beyond a reasonable degree of surety . My mother got up to start the supper . There was shortcake to be made . Adelaide and Gran'ma Reed were going home . One of the boys would be after them any minute . It was only a short walk , but Gran'ma Reed had rheumatism . Cory had to go with them . The Aunts were staying . After Adelaide and Gran'ma Reed had gone , my grandmother turned to my mother and said reprovingly :  --  " ' Miry , do n't you think you should have served tea before the ladies went ? " My mother , with the air of a chided child , stammeredexcuse . " I asked them to stay to supper , " she said . " Yes , " said my grandmother , tolerantly reproving , " but especially if they could n't stay , a cup of tea would have seemed more hospitable . Where is the pink-lustre tea set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the top shelf in the pantry , " replied my mother ; adding hastily , " I ' m saving it for her . " MILLBROOK 215 " Well , " said Grandmother Bogardus pleasantly , " it would n't hurt it any to use it , and this would have been just the time . " The pink-lustre tea set was a precious thing and probably beautiful ( although I liked Grandmother 's old silver one much better ) . Grandmother offered it impulsively soon after my birth , an heirloom presumably to be handed down to her own natural descendants , but had , my mother thought , regretted it ever since . That was on her first visit after my mother had married and , seeing the meagreness of furnishings so foreign to her own lustred standards , she had doubted the suitability of her gift , especially since my mother had married a man twenty years older than herself , and not an especially enterprisingone at that . Our living conditions , furnishing , and general appearancehad considerably stepped up since then and my grandmother had learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she still seemed to feel that my mother was lacking in appreciation of pink-lustre hospitality . She should have seen her carrying a jug of switchel to my father in the hayfield , adjusting a husking pin to her calloused fingersfor a long day in the October cornfields , or even , in an emergency , helping to mow a load of hay when a thunderstorm threatened. 216 MILLBROOKMy mother went into the kitchen , crestfallen and embarrassed . Aunt Hanner was plainly mad . There was a little of the grande dame about GrandmotherBogardus that had already ruffled Aunt Hanner'sbourgeois disposition , and , moreover , she had dared to hint some criticism of her precious brother ' Li j er 's wife . " ' Miry never lacks in hospitality , " said Aunt Hanner with asperity . " And besides , Adelaide and Miz ' Reed are relations . " My grandmother lifted her unspectacled eyes in mild surprise and folded up her bag . " Excuse me a minute , " she said politely , ignoring the implied reason for laxity in proper behavior . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years and the plumpness of her short figure , out the back door to make a necessary call before sitting down to supper . When she had gone there was an air to the room as if she had flirted her rustling skirts . In later years , remembering that slightly arrogant exit , I was reminded of the impudent Becky Sharp . Aunt Hanner rose briskly and set about laying the table . Aunt Sophrony went to the kitchen to help my mother . My father came in , glanced at the table , and started out again . " Where you going ? " Aunt Hanner asked , bustlingMILLBROOK 217about with plates , cups , and silver in her hands . " Supper ' 11 be ready in a minute . " My father grunted " Hunh ! " but halted , looking tentatively at his armchair by the window . " Miz ' Bogardus , " remarked Aunt Hanner contentiously , " must live real stylish  --  in Detroit . " My father glanced up at her inquiringly . Obviouslythere was more on her mind than mere conjectureas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He sat down , picked up a newspaper , put on his spectacles . " I du n no , " he said . " I never bin there . " Addingwith finality , and somewhat ambiguously , " I do n't expect to . " XIIIMURDERSCHOOL closed on the last Friday in June . There was an exhibition in the forenoon for which elaborate preparations had been made . Speeches and poems had been memorized , dialogues learned . Clara wanted to decorate the platform with sunflowersbecause she had been reading in some magazineabout Mr. Oscar Wilde and how he said the sunflower was beautiful and wore one in his buttonhole . And she had been to Jackson to call on Miz ' Lou Esty and Miz ' Esty told her how sunflowers were all the rage . But Miz ' Reverend Draper and Miz ' Dr. Babcockboth said she better not . They said folks would make fun of us . Fanny Akers giggled when she heard about it and said if they did she ' d take along an old hen to eat the seeds , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country folks raised sunflowers was to feed them to the fowls . Etty Myers said for land 's sakes why did n't Wil-MILLBROOK 219Liam put a poke on Clara to keep her home , or leastwaysa muzzle to keep her mouth shut . Everybodylaughed about it , which made Clara mad , but they did n't use the sunflowers . Bridal wreath and pineys were good enough . Crocks , churns , pitchers , even wooden pails , had been collected to hold these decorative contributions to the occasion . We thought the effect was beautifuland I still cling to the idea . Cory and I had new dresses . Cory 's was all of white  --  organdie with a blue sash tied hugely at the back with hair ribbons to match . My mother , with Lissy 's help , had made up the challis Grandmother had brought for me and so , fortified with that and my coral necklace , I thought surely I should be able at least to stumble through to the bitter end of " Roll Call , " the dramatic and tragical recitation allotted me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to performeven with credit . This , however , I had not once been able to do at rehearsals , and I could not now . I got as far as " Ezra Kerr . "  --  and a voice answered , " Here . " " Hiram Kerr . "  --  but no man replied  --  when the pathos of the inference overcame me and the world went blank . A murmured prompting took me on
