One evening last week Senator Joseph T. Robinson emerged from the White House . He was met by reporters who asked him about the President 's bill for enlarging the Supreme Court . In his capacity as leader of the Senate Majority who had just spent two hours with the head of his Party , he made answer : <P> " The measure will be proceeded with and it is expected that action will be taken on it during the present session . Aside from the provisions that relate to the Supreme Court , other features of the bill are to be regarded as of vital importance . It is felt that during the last few months some changes have occurred which modify the situation , but there still exists the necessity for the injection of new blood into the Court . " <P> In this oblique fashion was announced the biggest news emanating from Washington in many a week . It meant that Franklin Roosevelt , after four months ' stubborn insistence on his original plan for enlarging the Court , was at last willing to compromise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on a vigorous act , a stern lecture on the need for judiciary reform . He was severe with the Supreme Court . It had left important New Deal cases undecided . It had refused to prevent the suit of 19 utilities against TVA from going to trial in the lower courts . It had granted appeals on two suits against PWA power loans to municipalities , thereby keeping $50,000,000 of such loans tied up . It had refused the Government 's request to allow Electric Bond &; Share 's challenge of the Public Utility Holding Company Act to be appealed directly to the Supreme Court without going through a Circuit Court of Appeals . It had done nothing when a judge in Pennsylvania had enjoined Government attorneys from bringing suit in New York against the Aluminum Company of America . It had refused to decide six cases on which it had heard argument and ordered them reargued in the autumn . Yet in spite of all these things , the Court had adjourned for four months because eight old men needed rest. * Of course he was still intent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court bill was he prepared to accept ? That , said the President smiling , was asking about the trees . He was interested only in the forest . <P> With this backhanded admission , the key log was removed from the jam that had kept Congress tied up since February . Several weeks ago , Congressional leaders recognized that it would be impossible to pass the bill for six new Supreme Court Justices , but the President refused to believe them . They gave out hints of compromise ; Franklin Roosevelt refused to bat an eye . They deliberately delayed action on the bill hoping he would see his mistake . Finally , giving up hope of changing him , they began to plan on letting the Court bill die without action . When this was reported in the press last week , Franklin Roosevelt changed front barely in time to save face . It remained to be seen what else he could save . A two-judge compromise , which would easily have won in April , in June after a long , embittering fight was no longer certain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
