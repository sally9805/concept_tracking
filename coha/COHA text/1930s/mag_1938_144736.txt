In the U. S. , " five &; ten " is now pretty much a misnomer , with Woolworth and Kresge selling items up to $1 . But in England " three &; six penny ' ' still has some semblance of accuracy . Woolworth 's , which opened its first English store in 1909 and last year had 711 with profit of $32,000,000. no longer adheres to the strict price policy . But its biggest rival , the 228 Marks &; Spencer stores which earned just over $8,000,000 in 1937 , still does . <P> Last week these potent chains had a new rival , a peewee 3d. &; 6d. store named John Thrifty . It was started by none other than that fabulous merchant , Harry Gordon Selfridge , who left Chicago to open London 's first modern department store in 1909 . Last year Self ridge 's did $65,000,000 worth of business , some $20,000,000 of it in provincial divisions , at a profit of $4,000,000 . One highly successful department was the 3d. &; od. section . This fact , plus a growing certainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are Merchant Selfridge 's reasons for John Thrifty . He operated a 3d. &; 6d. chain by that name for several years but abandoned it in 1930 . Last week , John Thrifty returned to life in a maroon and cream shop on Oxford Street . Little Mr. Selfridge ( 5 ft. 5 in. ) will keep an eye on it from his mahogany desk in his big store across the street .
