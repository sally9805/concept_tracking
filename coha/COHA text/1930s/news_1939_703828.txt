txt The House of Representatives has spent the last three days debating the Naval Base Bill , which is part of the Administration 's national defense program . Only one point in it has aroused controversy .. This is the proposal to authorize the expenditure of $5,000,000 for the improvement of naval facilities at Guam . The sum involved is not large enough to do much more than build a breakwater , dredge a harbor and construct a few seaplane ramps and other similar accessories . But it is evident that the naval board which has recommended the plan regards it only as a first step toward the achievement of a much larger plan , which would be the development of Guam " as a major air and submarine base , with a garrison sufficient in strength to make its reduction or occupation a major effort on the part of any probable enemy , " and it is in the light of this larger objective that the whole project must be considered . Guam itself is a rocky lump of land , about twice the size of Queens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islands , the present outpost of our national defense in the Pacific , and only 1,350 miles from Yokohama . There is no question of the valuable strategic position which the island occupies in the naval strategy of the Western Pacific . Nor is there any question of the right of the United States to fortify the island if it chooses to do so . We relinquished that right in 1922 , when in the . Washington Naval Treaties we agreed to build no new fortifications west of Hawaii , as part of a general settlement of Pacific problems by which Japan agreed on her own side to a mutual limitation of naval strength and a pledge to respect the integrity of China . By her own choice Japan permitted the agreement on naval limitation to expire , and by her own choice she set out to destroy the integrity of China . In these circumstances we have plainly recovered our right to fortify Guam , and the only question at issue is whether , from all points of view , it is advantageous for us to do so . Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is argued , first , that while a fortified Guam is not indispensable to the protection either of the Hawaiian Islands or continental United States , it would nevertheless constitute a valuable outpost and , in the words of the naval board which recommends the plan , " reduce to its simplest possible terms " the problem of defense . In the second place , it is argued that a fortified Guam is necessary for the security of our Asiatic Squadron in the event of a war in which we are not involved , and also for the proper maintenance of our Asiatic Fleet in good repair in time of peace . In the third place , it is argued that a strong advanced fleet base at Guam would exert a restraining influence on Japan 's policies on the continent of Asia and at the same time , in the words of the naval board , " assure practical immunity of the Philippines against hostile attack in force . " These arguments have been advanced by men who have made a long and careful study of the matter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the problem . Yet even on technical points , and among experts , there is a difference of opinion , and none of the three chief arguments for a strongly armed Guam has been permitted to pass without challenge . In reply to the contention that a naval base at Guam , would strengthen the defense of the Hawaiian Islands , there are those wlio hold that it would stretch our defensive line over too great a distance to be effective ; that if the argument for an outpost to defend an outpost is a sound one , then , having fortified Guam in order to protect the Philippines , we should need to fortify some other still more remote island in order to protect Guam . Again , in reply to the contention that we need Guam as a repair base in time of peace and a fleet base in time of war , it is argued that , even if we did not have the Philippines , our ships could doubtless make use of British repair facilities at Hong Kong and Singapore in time of peace , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gibraltar , and that in the event of a war in which we are not involved our fleet could retire southward toward Singapore . and the Dutch East Indies with greater safety than toward Guam , through the labyrinth of Japanese islands which surround that outpost . Finally , so far as Japanese policy in China and our own relations with the Philippines are concerned , it is argued that these are essentially matters of statesmanship and not of naval strategy at all ; that the proper order of affairs is , first , to decide how far we intend to go toward restraining Japan on the continent of Asia , and , after consultation with the Philippine people , what our long-term policy toward those islands is to be , and then to provide ourselves with such instruments of power as we need in order to give effect to policies on which we have deliberately decided , rather than permit the instruments of power themselves to shape our policies for us.                    @
