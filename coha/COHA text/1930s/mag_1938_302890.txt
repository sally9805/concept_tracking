Edwin L. Rice , 57 , president of Rice Manufacturing and Aerial Transport Co. of Silver Spring , Md. , has for 20 years devoted his spare time to submitting ideas to the U. S. Navy . Last week when the Senate Naval Affairs Committee , in its fourth week of hearings on Franklin Roosevelt 's bill to spend $1,500,000,000 , enlarging the U. S. Navy , was considering a provision to provide $15,000,000 " for development of ideas on national defense , " Mr. Rice hastened to contribute . His idea : A canal across the U. S. to enable one navy to defend both coasts . His reasoning : A 360-mile ditch between the Missouri and Columbia Rivers in northern Montana would open a waterway at least six feet deep between New Orleans and Portland , Ore . ( A 260-mile ditch between the Potomac and Ohio would open a waterway from Washington , D. C. to Cairo , Ill. on the Mississippi . ) <P> Most remarkable feature of Mr. Rice 's 20-year career as an idea man to the Navy is that the Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after hearing his proposal , the Committee dropped the whole provision , sent the rest of the bill to the Senate recommending passage .
