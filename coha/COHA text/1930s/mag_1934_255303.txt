Billboards are a blight upon the Nation . Such a statement , often made , drives every outdoor advertising man into a sputtering rage . His trade association has rigid rules against placing billboards where they may be resented by " fair-minded " citizens-in purely residential districts , around parks or in front of " natural scenic beauty spots . " Ethical outdoor advertising men are not supposed to use " snipes " ( small roadside signs ) , " daubs " ( painted on rocks or fences ) or " tackers " ( tacked on trees ) . Furthermore , all good outdoor advertising men deplore the word billboard . They all refer to their medium as " poster panels " or " painted bulletins . " <P> Last week the Outdoor Advertising Association of America held its 44th annual convention in Chicago . In the " Hangar " ballroom atop the Hotel LaSalle the billboard men praised their new Traffic Audit Bureau , which does much the same job that the Audit Bureau of Circulation does for publications . And they voted unanimously to retain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on poster panels . But as before members may accept such advertising for painted boards , and beer will still be acceptable on both kinds . <P> Involving a sacrifice of perhaps $2,000,000 a year , the action on poster panels was inspired by no high-toned moral considerations but by the fact that : 1 ) a large number of the 75,000,000 U. S. citizens who are supposed to read billboard advertising regard hard liquor advertising in church &; school communities as something less than a mixed blessing ; 2 ) many a big advertiser like Henry Ford , Howard Heinz or W. K. Kellogg would be profoundly shocked to see his posters hard by one for Golden Wedding rye ; 3 ) poster space is sold in " showings " or fixed units . <P> A showing is so many billboards in a city area . The buyer may buy a showing in one community or 17,000 showings in 17,000 communities ; or one-half or one-quarter showings . In every case the rate is the same-$7.80 per month for each regular billboard , $35 per month for each illuminated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. S. ran about $75,000,000 annually . This year it will foot up to some $38,000,000 , of which $30,000,000 is national advertising . There are still over 200,000 billboards ( cost : $125 each ) throughout the land .
