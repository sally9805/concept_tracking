txt A new device to enable the pedestrian himself to stop , automobUe traffic long enough for him to get across a street safely was installed in Bronxville today by the Westchester county park commission . The device , a signal light , is described as " semi-vehicular actuated . " When no cars are approaching it . gives the green signal of safety to Pedestrians . Approaching cars , however , strike a detection unit in the pavement which causes the light to turn a warning red . If a continual stream of cars is passing , as is sometimes the case , the pedestrian can take matters into his own hands . he needs to do is press a button conveniently placed . That turns on a red light over the parkway stopping the automobiles . The light stays on automatically long enough to let the pedestrian cross . Then it switches back to the green and the cars proceed .
