txt Will Rogers Reports Finding Every One in New York Happy To the Editor of The New York Times : Everybody is happy here in New York tonight . The market went up today . Spirits here just go up or down according to that day 's market . They think the whole United States just depends on what pocket the little white ball rolled into on the Exchange roulette table that day . But , our country has got so that each one of us have to live by a " racket " of some kind , and none of us must be too critical of the other fellow 's " racket . " When you figure it right down , none of us are in a really essential business but the farmer , and he raises so much that even his business is partly non-essential . But , we got to be tolerant , for these New Yorkers are likable rascals , even when they are skinning you . Yours , WILL ROGERS . New York , May 1 .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
