Sudden suppression of Russia 's 1937 census figures and the " disappearance " of statisticians who prepared them led to that bad internal conditions had lowered Russia 's population , doubts abroad about Soviet military civil strength . <P> Timed to counteract this impression in London and Paris while pact bargaining hangs fire , its first complete census figures since 1926 were published by the Soviet Government last week . They showed a population for the whole Soviet Union of 170,467,186 ( a gain of 23,500,000 since were counted in 1926 ) . Exulted Pravda : The percent of population growth not surpassed by any other country . Its estimates : U. S. 11% ; Italy 9% ; Germany 7% ; Britain 5% ; France 2.7% . Exulted Chief of the Central Statistical Administration of the National Economy Sautin : " A continuous growth of population is a law of socialism .
