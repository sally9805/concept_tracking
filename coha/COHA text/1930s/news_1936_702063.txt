txt July 's heavy drought toll was recorded today in new grain estimates as the Department of Agriculture predicted the smallest corn crop in fifty-five years , a wheat crop bare , ly adequate for domestic reqUiremeats , " greatly reduced " supplies Of fruits and vegetables and a need for " extensive readjustment of livestock numbers and of feeding practices . " The figures of the government crop reporting board , which will be the basis for a broadened relief program , forecast a corn crop of only 1,439,135,000 bushels , smallest since 1881 , reflecting losses of more than 800,000,000 bushels since the board 's last estimate on July 10 , due to continuance of the hot , dry weather . The decrease added new thousands to the numbers of cattle which will have to move to market for slaughter ahead of time to prevent even greater financial losses to farmers later through animal starvation . Hogs are expected to be reduced in even greater numbers than cattle . Higher prices to consumers for both kinds of meat are likely as a consequence . The report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated a total wheat crop of only 632,745,000 bushels . Ordinarily about 625,000,000 bushels are needed for domestic food and livestock feeding requirements , but there is still a healthy carry-over of that grain except in Spring wheat varieties , Taking stock of the seriousness of the situation , the Works Progress Administration announced that " a national appeal for clothing may be necessary to provide clothing for families on drought-devastated farms of the Dakotas and possibly other States . " It ordered drought relief put on a " disaster " basis . The agency enlarged its drought employment quota to 108,500 in the thirteen worst afflicted States and said that with present emergency employment totaling 52,000 in that area , every effort was being made to increase the number daily . Illinois was placed in the emer- gency drought area for the first time , along with a total of thirty counties in seven States , which brought the territory in need of Federal direct or work relief to a total of 920 counties in twenty-two States . Poorest Corn Crop Since 1881 The 1,439,135,000-bushel corn crop predicted by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harvested last year and an average output of 2,553 , - 424,000 bushels during the five years 1928-32 . On the basis of conditions prevailing at the beginning of that month , the board had estimated a current crop of 2,244,834,000 bushels , or only a little under the preceding fiveyear average . In predicting " the smallest corn crop since 1881 , , " the board named a year not altogether representa1 tive , for the planted acreage then was only 63,026,000 , the yield per acre 19.8 bushels , and the crop 1,244,803,000 bushels . This year 98,517,000 acres were planted , the yield per acre was estimated today at 14.6 bushels to the acre . Pastures Poor in Many States - With the exception of the last three years , when the grain was seriously damaged either by drought or rust , the wheat crop indicated in today 's report is the smallest since 1917 , when but 619 , - 790,000 bushels were harvested . The prospective crop of oats , at 771,703,000 bushels , would be the smallest , with the exception of 1933 and 1934 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated crop of rye would be the smallest since 1899 . The prospective barley crop , at 145,027,000 bushels , would be the shortest since 1921 . " Irrespective of weather conditions during the remainder of the season , there will be a shortage of grain that will necessitate rather heavy marketings of grain-consuming livestock and a reduction in , the grain ration of the livestock wintered , " said the board . " In a fourth of the States pastures were the poorest on record for Aug. 1 , and for the country as a whole they were almost as poor as in August , 1934 . This has necessitated a heavy Summer feeding of hay and forage and is causing a severe shortage of roughage in the northern Great Plains area and threatens to cause shortages elsewhere , the outlook depending primarily on how soon the drought is broken . " Resume of Feed Situation Of the prospects on feed for stock the board gave this summary : " Present indications are that the livestock feed situation is somewhat less serious than it was at this time in 1934 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve Fall pastures as they did in 1934 . In 1934 an exceptionally mild and open Winter in much of the drought territory also decreased feed requirements . " The shortage of feed grains will necessitate extensive readjustments of livestock numbers and of feeding practices . In comparison with 1934 the available supply of feed grains ( production adjusted for carry-over and feed wheat ) is expected to be about 5 per cent greater , whereas the number of grainconsuming units of livestock and poultry on farms on Aug. 1 this year was about 3 per cent less than on Aug. 1 , 1934 . " Available hay supplies appear to be about 20 per cent greater and the number of hay-consuming animals 9 per cent less this year than in 1934 . The greatest shortage in feed grains will be in corn , the total supply of which will be less than in 1934 , and the greatest readjustments in numbers of livestock will be in hogs , which are most dependent upon corn supplies . " Hay Very Short in Some Areas The extremely hot weather and drought over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Montana and southward to the Cotton Belt had reduced prospects for corn to about 2.6 per cent less than the short crop of 1934 and about 56 per cent of average production , the board pointed out . It went on to say : " With the production of oats forecast at about 772,000,000 bushels , barley at 145,000,000 and grain sorghum at 81,600,000 , all very light crops , the total production of the four feed grains is expected to total only about 58,000,000 tons . " This would be 8 per cent more ? than the final harvest of 1934 , but about 31 per cent less than production in any other recent year and 42 per cent less than the 1923-32 average . " Prospects for hay are relatively much better . Allowing for first cuttings already harvested and assuming the usual progressive relief of the drought , production is forecast at nearly 69,000,000 tons , compared with 87,000,000 last year and the short crop of 58,000,000 tons in 1934 . " Considering the rather larger quantity of old hay on hand and the probability that available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is expected to be about equal to the average quantity fed during the last six years , a period of short supplies . " However , in some areas , principally in the western part of the Dakotas , Eastern Montana and the northeast corner of Wyoming , hay supplies are seriously short , and over a wide area pastures are so short that farmers are being compelled to feed hay that may be badly needed next Winter . Potato Crop Is " Badly Hurt " " The Aug. 1 prospects indicated light crops of wheat , rye , buckwheat , beans , potatoes , several , commercial truck crops and can-1 ning vegetables , and the principal fruits except pears and citrus . About average crops of rice and sweet potatoes are expected . The wheat crop is about equal to usual domestic requirements . " The potato crop has been badly hurt , but in Northern States A considerable degree of recovery M still possible . The forecast shows 295 , - 000,000 bushels as the most probable production . This would be about 21 per cent below average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1916 . " Dry edible beans are indicated at about 14 per cent below average , but in both New York and Michigan considerable improvement is still possible . Stands of late cabbage have been thinned and growth retarded by dry weather . Sweet corn has suffered in most producing States . " Home gardens have suffered seriously throughout the drought area , and in the important commercial vegetable areas of the Lake States prospective yields of late vegetable crops have been greatly reduced . " Fruits have been needing rain in New York , Virginia , Michigan , Arkansas and other important States , but late Spring frosts are chiefly responsible for the low production expected . Expect Citrus to Be Plentiful " The combined production of apples , peaches , pears , grapes , cherries , plums , prunes and apricots this season is expected to be 27 per cent less than it was last year and 23 per cent below the 1928-32 average . " Production of most of these fruits will be light but pears will be well up to average , and production of citrus fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tobacco had an unfavorable start , due chiefly to dry weather in June south of the Ohio and Potomac Rivers . The present forecast of 1,107,000,000 pounds indicates a larger crop than was harvested in either 1932 or 1934 , but it would still be the third smallest crop in recent years . " The flaxseed crop is estimated at 6,342,000 bushels . This would be above production in 1934 but would be only about 40 per cent of the 1928-32 average production . " Cotton , unlike most other crops , was favored by weather conditions during July and less than the usual damage from the boll weevil is probable . Yields are expected to be above average in all States except Virginia , the Carolinas and Oklahoma , with prospects particularly favorable in the States bordering the Mississippi River . " The forecast of Aug. 8 indicated 12,481,000 bales , compared with 10 , - 638,000 bales in 1935 , 9,636,000 bales in 1934 and average of 14,667,000 bales during the five years 1928-32.
