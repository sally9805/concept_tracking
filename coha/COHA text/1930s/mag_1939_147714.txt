The platform of the railroad station of Lublin , in German Poland , teemed . On it stood a forlorn , broken spirited crowd who moved only when shoved . The people were utterly destitute . All they had for baggage was here a knapsack , there a handbag , sometimes just a cloth bundle . A few carried scraps of food for which they had no stomach . The most any had in cash was 300 marks ( $120 ) . Train after train pulled in , and passengers poured out like ashes from dump-trucks . The heavy crowd became unmanageable . Finally the stationmaster blustered out , ordered that not one more passenger should alight . More trains came in . He ordered them not to stop , to clear out . " But where to , with this cargo ? " asked the engineers . <P> Lublin , Poland , the city which once complained because the Tsars changed a nobleman 's castle into a prison , was recently chosen by Adolf Hitler as the site of his long-planned Jew-sump . By next April 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be evacuated to Lublin or other " reservations " like it from Bohemia , 65,000 from Vienna , 30,000 from Posen and the onetime Polish Corridor , 175,000 from the Lodz district , 240,000 from Germany proper . <P> The lot of the first arrivals was last week reported by the Berlin correspondent of the Copenhagen Politiken . The unhappy Jews were virtual slaves . The area around the city was entirely hedged in by barbed wire and bayonets . Gradually the Jews were herded from the station , given quarters of sorts , put immediately to work ( twelve hours a day ) on roads , fields , bogs , buildings .
