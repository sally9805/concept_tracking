RETREAT-C . R. Benstead-Century ( $2.50 ) . <P> When the Rev. Elliot Warne left his snug little parish in England to go to France as an earnest , sensitive , high-minded chaplain , he could not have picked a worse time . He joined his unit , an artillery brigade in Cough 's Fifth Army , in the spring of 1918 , four hours before Ludendorff launched his spring offensive . The first barrage shattered Chaplain Warne 's nerve . For the next three weeks of nightmare , as the lines bent daily backward but never quite broke , he was in an increasing agony of bewildered fear and uselessness . Said one of the mess : " This parson of ours came out , I should say , thinking he was going to preach a Jihad. * All parsons do , to a certain extent . And what happens-some of ' em turn into quite good mess caterers , and that 's about all . " Chaplain Warne did not even turn into a good mess-caterer . Confronted by the daily reality of war and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his fellows , first his courage , then his preconceived notions , then his faith , then his reason , gave way . He was carried off at last to a hospital to die like a dog with rabies . <P> Though Retreat does not throw a beam of flattering light on army chaplains , the book has been praised by no less a churchman than gloomy Dean Inge , of London 's St. Paul 's Cathedral .
