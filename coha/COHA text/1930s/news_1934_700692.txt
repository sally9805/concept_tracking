txt Box City Needs Water . To the Editor of The NM York Times : Not so many days ago I saw Box City , where dwell squatters , who are workless , hopeless , without sufficient of anything , except , as one put it , the right to behave himself and thus be independent . Most of all they lack water . On the way home I saw the children of a far better neighborhood , where tubs and water are not uncommon , playing under a sprinkler , which is the city 's contribution via the Fire Department to kiddie comfort and pleasure . Is there any law limiting such to children . only ? If so , could not our Fire Department be lawless to the extent of giving those Box City dwellers water for cleaner bodies , cleaner clothing , oleaner outlooks ? If they could be privileged to use just one fire plug every night it would be appreciated . I am sure . MARY STARR TAYLOR . New York , July 3 , 1934.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
