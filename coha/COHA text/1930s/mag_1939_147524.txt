See My Lawyer ( by Richard Maibaum &; Harry Clork ; produced by George Abbott ) is one of those athletic farces which have the delicacy of a subpoena and the subtlety of an alarm clock . A firm of young lawyers ready for the poorhouse ropes in a millionaire playboy overripe for the asylum . As the gilded nitwit is continuously prankish-he pours gin into milk bottles , steals peek-machines from penny arcades , drives his car up &; down freight elevators , ties up girls on billiard tables-the firm of Lee , Russo &; O'Rourke enjoys a continuous revenue , for a time . Then the screwball Tom ( Eddie Nugent ) makes off with Lawyer Lee 's fiancee , and the riot is on . <P> See My Lawyer bongs and clatters like a bowling alley , but instead of ripping off strikes &; spares , the pins go down only two or three at a time , and the pin boys are much too slow in setting them up again . The show has laughs , but never ( as a farce must ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard , tries to be a little too crazy . It 's the old George Abbott formula minus the old George Abbott form : quite a drop from the headlong days of Three Men on a Horse and Room Service , when in the world of farce , the Abbotts spoke only to God . <P> Freely mentioned as the inspiration for the crackpot playboy is four-times married , asbestos-protected Tommy Manville . After witnessing the opening performance of See My Lawyer , Manville went on to a nightclub . There , reported spry Columnist Leonard Lyons , Manville encountered Actor Nugent , and putting his arms around Nugent 's shoulders , murmured : " Thank you so much for not having made me out a ridiculous character !
