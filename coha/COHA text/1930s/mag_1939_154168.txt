In traditional style , Broadway , after a haggard week-before-Christmas , had a full-to-bursting holiday week . One matinee day accumulated , around Manhattan , 681 standees , biggest matinee box office since 1929 . The period was crammed with openings , three of them in the nature of comebacks : <P> Blossom Time , a perennial , was back on Broadway for the first time since 1931 . The old-fashioned operetta , full of hideous buffoonery , has a score-based on some of Franz Schubert 's loveliest melodies-as appealing as ever . <P> Vaudeville was back on Broadway for the first time since 1932 . The new offering , Vaudeville Marches On , retains the old spirit and most of the old gags . Best number : The Wiere Brothers , three European cutups who literally draw laughter out of a hat . <P> Elsie Janis was back on Broadway for the first time since 1928 . After years in retirement , Elsie has not slowed up . With no voice to speak of , she still puts a song across . She can , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rope . She screws up her face and becomes Sarah Bernhardt , juggles her voice and becomes Ethel Barrymore . Or she just wanders around the stage dropping patter soft as daisies until bang ! something sharp pops .
