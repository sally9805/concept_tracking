In 1774 a Virginia gentleman , George Washington , with large landed interests on both sides of the Alleghenies , began urging the construction of a canal to link the Atlantic seaboard with the trading centres of the Ohio valley . Though the need for trade routes was obvious , engineers sneered at such an undertaking , and the plan was forgotten . Half a century later , the Chesapeake &; Ohio Canal Co. was founded , and in 1850 an $11,500,000 , 184-mile canal between Georgetown , D. C. and Cumberland , Md. was opened . For 73 years hundreds of coal barges plied between the mouth of the Potomac and mining towns over the mountains . Eventually the Baltimore &; Ohio Railroad , whose tracks paralleled the waterway , gained control of the canal . <P> Early this , year B. &; O. needed cash . Its charges have zoomed steadily for years , now total $32,000,000 annually on fixed obligations of $674,000,000 . In January , B. &; O. 's resourceful President Daniel Willard got an $8,233,000 RFC loan through his good friend , RFC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put up all his available collateral-including the Chesapeake &; Ohio Canal , which has not been used for shipping since 1923 . Last week , B. &; 0 . again needed funds to meet $1,700,000 in interest payments due first of this month . No less resourceful than his father , Daniel Willard Jr . appealed to Washington , quickly and unexpectedly raised the money. * <P> Presumably put through privately by Chairman Jones and Daniel Willard Jr. , the deal was as fabulous as it was timely : through RFC , B. &; O. sold its down-at-the-heel canal to PWA ( subject to a court receivership settlement ) for $2,000,000 , approximately $1,000,000 above its book value , thereby getting enough cash to meet its interest payments . Exactly what PWA will do with its canal is still uncertain . According to present plans , it will turn the property over to National Park Service , which may restore the picturesque taverns and lock houses flanking the waterway . The 22-mile section between Washington and Point of Rocks , Md. , it may turn into a boating and canoeing paradise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use part of the canal as right-of-way for a national highway between Washington and Gettysburg , Pa . <P> <P> *Simultaneously it was reported that Mr. Willard , 77 , dean of U. S. railroaders , now in his 29th year as B. &; O. president , might retire this fall .
