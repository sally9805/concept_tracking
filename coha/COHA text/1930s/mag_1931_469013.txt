SOON the annual automobile show will be held in New York , to he followed shortly by another in Chicago , which , in turn , will be followed by lesser shows in lesser communities until , by May , the entire United States will have had an opportunity to examine the new season 's new cars . Millions of men , women , and children , impelled by curiosity , interest , or Mr. Arthur Brisbane 's yearly editorial endorsing automobile ownership , will flock to these motor shows , for to see and to admire . Whether or not they can afford to buy new machines , they will climb in and out of convertible sedans and rumble seats . They will peer under hoods and into transmissions . They will manipulate pedals and gearshift levers . They will stand open-mouthed , listening to lectures on current mechanical fads and fashions ? such as free-wheeling and adjustable shock absorbers . They will ask innumerable questions . They will leave fingerprints on polished metal and lacquer . And , the young among them especially , they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about what people do at automobile shows , because for years I was one of their most passionate devotees . I used to attend the New York shows regularly , day after day , studying every detail of each new model , badgering the salesmen and making myself a thorough nuisance . I loved cars in the way that some persons love horses and could distinguishone vintage from another by the design of a tire-carrier or the curve of a mudguard . Except for a policeman on the lookout for malefactors , this is undoubtedly among the most futile of accomplishments . I exhume my past not from any delusion that you might be interested in so obviously misspent a youth , but rather to establish a background of sorts for the present thesis , which is , in part , in the nature of a lament . It is a lament for a dead glamour and for the passing of motoring as a sport . Do not misunderstand me . It would be absurd to deny that the automobiles of 1932 are the most beautiful , comfortable , efficient , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? or that they offer the greatest values . It would be absurd to assert that present-day motoring is devoid of thrills . For anyone not desperately blase there is unquestionably a thrill in the swift responsiveness and the silent , catlike power of the latest models . Through the development of the motor car into a dependable , everyday instrument of living we have gained immeasurably . On that score there can be no argument . Yet , it seems to me , our gain in this instance , as in some others , has not been one hundred per cent net . The difference between the motoring of before the War and that of to-day is analogous to the difference between beer and near-beer : the ingredients are the same , but the spirit is missing . II In the early days the purchase of a car was an adventure . To some of the younger set this may be news , as the following story would seem to prove . A boy who had been swimming at a seashore resort lost his shoes , so started to drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was very clever to be able to drive without shoes . To which he replied , in all seriousness , " Shucks , what d' you suppose people did before shoes were invented ? " Other persons who also believe that automobiles came before shoes are hereby warned to read no farther . This article is not for them . In the early days , I repeat , the purchase of a car was an adventure . The very decision to take the plunge required considerable sporting blood . For sales were made for cash only ; hence for the average man buying a car involved drawing on his savings or mortgaging his property in order to pay for it . And that in turn meant that he would lose caste in the eyes of his banker . But granted that a man was so thoroughly infected with the motor fever that he was willing to impair his standing at the bank , he had to make still further demands on his sporting instinct . To decide to buy an automobile was one thing . To decide which to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States a few years previous to the turn of the century , the automotive era may be said to have been actually ushered in with the year 1900 . It was in November of that year that the first show , held at the old Madison Square Garden in New York , focussed the thoughts of the nation upon the horseless carriage . In that day the most urgent problem confronting the stalwart little band of pioneers was how to convince a skeptical public that the rickety new contraptions would run . Inasmuch as many of them ran by fits and starts only , often resisting every effort to make them go at all , their sponsors ' task was not an easy one . But by dint of enthusiasm , hard work , and the judicious cribbing of ideas and methods from Europe , where the automotive art was comparatively advanced , our early car-makers overcame the obstacle of general skepticism with amazing rapidity . In little more than five years ? a short span in which to effect a nation-wide conversion ? America became motor mast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ridiculed for attempting the impossible , the inventors suddenly found themselves men of the hour . From trying to peddle an innovation that nobody wanted , they were overwhelmed by a demand beyond their most sanguine expectations . Motor factories sprang up by the score , started by opportunists eager to make what money they could out of the new craze while it lasted . Of these men some were engineers , some business men , some blue-sky promoters who saw an unparalleled chance to sell bogus stock . Honest men and rogues scrambled aboard the band wagon in increasing numbers . By 1909 one hundred-odd domestic makes of auto .. mobiles were on the market in this country ; or rather , to be accurate , a hundred-odd were advertised . Some of them existed only on paper . Few of them lived up to the claims of their makers . Here are some of the names , selected at random . Perhaps one or more among them may bring you a reminiscent chuckle : Grout , Welch , Matheson , Corbin , KlineKar , Lozier , Klink , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parry , Apperson , Alm Sharp Arrow , Carter Car , Metz , DeTamble , Cameron , CinO , Demotcar , Lambert , Regal , Rambler , Croxton-Keeton , Glide , Speedwell , Sultan , Pennsylvania , Haynes , Badger , Black Crow , Chalmers-Detroit , Abbott-Detroit , Warren-Detroit , Johnson , Jackson , Lexington , Rider-Lewis , American , Gaeth , Stevens-Duryea , Winton , Mitchell , Rainier , Elmore , National , Selden , Auto-bug , Brush , Stoddard-Dayton , Stearns , Knox , Premier . Of the foregoing , none is manufactured to-day . Of all the makes advertised in 1909 , less than twenty are still on the market . Most of them came to an early and well-deserved end . In addition to those mentioned , probably another hundred , of more recent manufacture , have made their bows , played their parts in the changing motor drama , and vanished . Not all of them were bad . Some , indeed , were very good ? for their epoch . Here and there one still encounters them , ten , sometimes twenty years old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life though it has long since passed them by . The trade knows them as " orphans . " The best of the makes listed above were expensive machines built by hand at the rate of one or two a day . Some cheaper models were turned out at the rate of five thousand a year . But of well-known makes at any price there were not nearly enough to go round . The average man who had decided to buy a car did n't want to wait months for delivery . If he could n't have his first choice at once he took a chance on a competing brand . Not knowing the difference between a spark plug and a camshaft , the prudent purchaser usually sought the advice of an expert . He would engage an engineer or a mechanic to make a critical examination of the various offerings . Dealers and mandfacturera encouraged this practice . " Bring your own expert , " they advertised , " and he will tell you that point for point the 1910 Whatnot is the best light four in the industry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could not obtain a bigger fee from one of the Whatnot 's competitors . Taking care of the prospect 's expert ? a matter involving from five to twenty-five dollars ? was considered part of the legitimate expense of selling a car . But even if the consultant in the case happened to be above such dealings , his opinion was of doubtful value . For , scientifically speaking , even the manufacturers themselves knew relatively little about their products . Their principal method of testing cars was by entering them in races and endurance contests . A victory in one of these events they loudly heralded as indisputable proof of excellence . As a matter of fact , however , there were so many speed trials and reliability runs and so little consistency on the part of the entries , that almost any car had a chance to win sometime , somewhere ; and a victory meant a good deal less than the public was led to believe . Ignorant of metallurgy , lacking facilities or funds for research , without adequate machinery for precision manufacture , the car-makers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , groping amid a welter of theories , they learned by the method of trial and error , letting the public pay the bills . They changed their designs in the hope of improving them , but often launched new models without knowing definitely that these were better than the old . Yet they announced each debutante as the ultimate triumph of engineering genius . " The car as now made , " said one factory in 1909 , " is perfection . We have spent thirteen years in making it better and there 's little room to go farther . " The air was thick with wild claims and controversy regarding fundamental questions of design . Make-and-break vs. jump spark ignition ; chain vs. shaft drive ; sliding gear transmissions vs. planetary and friction vs both ; gasoline engines vs. steam ; the long-stroke motor vs. the short-stroke motor , et cetera , et cetera . Each manufacturer advanced his own pet solutions to these problems as the correct ones . All the layman had to do was to decide whom to believe . Small wonder that buying a ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motor car buyers were sportsmen then . They were human beings quickened by human impulses . They were not sordidly investing in " personal transportation , " as we do today . They were taking a flyer ? if you 'll allow me the phrase ? in personal fun and social prestige . Certain solemn minds would have you believe that the public 's swift response to the automotive idea sprang from man 's passion to conquer time and space . I do not believe it . It seems highly improbable that John Doe , asked why he proposed to buy an automobile , would have replied , " Because I yearn to conquer time and space . " I think , had he answered truthfully , he would have said , " Because Richard Roe 's thinking of getting one and I want to beat him to it . " III Not only the purchase of a car , but each trip one took in it , was an adventure . The advance preparations for a day 's tour of fifty miles had to be planned with almost as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Papa , who in those days was the head man in the home garage , used to spend his spare time between weekends tightening nuts and bolts , polishing brass-work , cleaning spark plugs or breaker points , draining dirt out of the carburetor , insulating bare wires with bicycle tape and picking glass or nails out of the tires . He was determined it should be through no fault of his if , on the morning of the trip , the car refused to start . It often happened , however , despite all papa 's care and after mama and the girls and the invited guests had climbed into their seats , that the motor did refuse to start , either through sheer contrariness , or because , in his zeal , papa had neglected to open the fuel valve , or reconnect the ignition . Many a picnic was eaten on the front porch by the women-folk , while the car owner and his sympathetic friend took turns at the crank handle and the carless neighbors made quaint remarks . To avoid this embarrassing situation , papa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping to get the motor running and warmed up well in advance of the hour of departure . At the same time he would make a final inspection of the tool kit , making sure that it contained the tow-rope , tire pump , jack -- with brick to stand it on ? collapsible water bucket and , if rain threatened , a handy block and tackle for use in pulling out of mud holes . The number and variety of ailments the early motor cars were heir to were limited only by the number and variety of parts they contained . To-day such disorders , to borrow a term from medicine , are in the main functional rather than organic . But in the first fifteen years of the century organic defects were as common as functional disturbances . Not only did parts wriggle out of adjustment , but they broke , or dropped off , the clanging of their fall drowned out by the general hubbub the car made . One day , as late as 1916 , my father was driving a month-old machine , thinking how beautifully it ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he spent an hour or more trying by orthodox means to make it start again , only to discover at last that the gasoline tank was missing . It had parted company with the car some distance up the road . 0 TEMPORA ! But a lost gas tank was of little consequence in comparison with some other afflictions . Not infrequently an entire engine , as though tired of the struggle , would lose its grip on the chassis and fall onto the highway . Broken springs and axles were the motorist 's common fare , as were broken steering knuckles , truss rods , connecting rods , universal joints , and drive chains . Radiators leaked , water-jackets cracked , carburetors clogged , and lubricators failed to lubricate . Unless he could afford a chauffeur , the new-fledged motorist needed instruction not in driving only , but in the theory of the motor that he proposed to operate . Only by knowing his car and what made it go could he be reasonably sure it would take him out and bring him back under its own power . Garages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , were places to be shunned . The average mechanic was a young man of vast enthusiasm , but monumental ignorance . His favorite method of diagnosing any case of trouble was to begin taking the entire machine apart . Many an unwary motorist , whose car had stopped for no more serious reason than that the fuel tank was empty , or a wire disconnected , was forced to take his party home by train because some roadside experimenter had partially disassembled the works and then been unable to fit them together again . As a matter of fact , taking a car apart was no task to be undertaken lightly . As though stipulating : " What the factory hath joined , let no mar put asunder , " the makers had made little provision for that form of sacrilege . It was not possible , as it is to-day , to remove a gear-box , for instance , by merely unscrewing a few nuts . You first had to remove the car body , in order to see where and how the transmission was secured to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were likely to find that the part in question had been fastened in place with rivets , for all time . This forthright system of construction was sometimes baffling to mechanics . In justice to the car makers it should be stated that the vicissitudes of motoring were not wholly due to faulty design and construction . The condition of the roads was in large measure to blame for the frequent breakage of parts and the tendency of nuts and bolts to work loose . Potholes and thank-you-ma'ams , with which the highways were riddled , exacted a heavy toll from cars and riders alike . The ordinary springs were quite inadequate ( and are to-day ) to the task of absorbing road shocks unaided . Trick springs and auxiliary devices were among the earliest accessories on the market . " Our spring , " promised one advertiser , " makes it possible for ladies to enjoy mobiling without being subjected to severe jolts or a general shaking up , and eliminates the necessity of calling a physician after each trip , on account of rough roads . The spring that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I wish to remark , parenthetically , that the conception of a car as a rest resort is a lost ideal it might pay us to revive . For though present-day motoring may not continually subject our bodies to severe jolts , it is scarcely soothing to our nerves . IV Generally speaking , the equipment of a car , included in its list price , consisted of three oil lamps , a set of tools , and an instruction book . Some few makes were factory-equipped with tops , but usually top , windshield , headlights , acetylene generator , spare tires and tubes and other important items came under the head of extras . A man was free to choose his equipment according to his taste and his resources ; and when he sold the car he was also free , if he wished , to strip it of these added accouterments , so that he might use them on its successor , or sell them separately . The principal disadvantage of this system was that the purchaser was likely to find himself spending a good deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet it was not without its advantages . To-day we still pay extra for " de luxe " equipment , but we can not remove it and hope to trade-in or sell our cars without it . Many and marvelous ? on paper at least ? were the gadgets and do-funnies offered in the accessory stores to catch the motorist 's vagrant dollars . Despite the limitations of space , I can not resist mentioning a few , such as the autophonendoscope , a device similar to a stethoscope , which enabled you to listen to the heart and lungs of your motor and diagnose their ills by ear . There were little chains for attaching to your mudguards , designed to prevent nails from becoming too deeply embedded in the tires . There was a variety of windshields , among them one advertised as being adjustable to fifty-nine positions . There was a natty rubberized cape apron , a sort of poncho for riders in topless cars . Five persons could keep their bodies dry under it , while their heads protruded through convenient slits that could be buttoned when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , geared to the wheels like speedometers . One of these , the Rhodes Pathfinder , was a metal box clamped to the steering column . Through a glass window in the box you could watch your route unwinding on a moving map , mile by mile , schoolhouse by schoolhouse . To facilitate its use at night it was illuminated and provided with a bell that rang every time you approached a turn . Like many another device of that period , it worked perfectly but it was quite valueless . You could n't watch the Pathfinder and watch the road too , and it was more satisfactory , on the whole , to watch the road . However , buying attractive but useless accessories was a feature of motoring that gave the sport an added zest . Again in justice to the ear-makers , it should be said that at least fifty per cent of the motorist 's grief resulted from tire trouble . Rim cuts , punctures , sand blisters , and blowouts were regular concomitants of motoring . Four flat tires in the course of a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereas a trip devoid of a single one was something to talk about . And before the adoption of demountable rims , tire repairs entailed real work . You had to wrench the casing off the wheel , patch or replace the inner tube , squeeze it back into the casing without pinching it or tearing out the valve , and maneuver the shoe into place again . After which , all hands to the pump . A book could be filled with descriptions of the inventions designed to supplant , or reinforce , the pneumatic tire . There were chrome leather covers , studded with steel discs , guaranteed to be puncture and blowout proof . There were fillers , of sponge rubber and other compressible materials , to he used instead of air . There were solid-rubber tires and any number of patent wheels having intricate spring arrangements instead of spokes . There were hand pumps , foot pumps , and pumps driven by the engine or the rear wheels of the car . One could even buy cylinders of compressed carbonic gas for tire inflation . Of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tire . This was a pneumatic containing a certain gummy substance that was supposed automatically to seal any puncture . It was not unique in that , for there were other so-called self-sealing tires . The unique feature of the valveless was the method of inflating it , which was by means of a hollow needle , like a hypodermic , that you thrust ruthlessly through the side-wall . Those among you who never experienced pre-war motoring may conclude , from my picture of it , that it must have been pretty dreadful . In the interest of truth I must admit that it did have its darker aspects , yet it was seldom dull or monotonous . There were compensations for the deficiencies in cars , tires , and roads . Chief among these was the spirit of motorists as a class . When a man bought a car he hoped for the best , but accepted the worst , if it came , philosophically . In the event of a breakdown he did not feel that his life had been blighted , but took off his coat and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remedy , he sent for help or waited until some other motorist came along . Nowadays if you hail an approaching driver he puts on speed for fear you may be a gangster . When motor cars were young a stranded motorist was a brother in distress , entitled to technical aid and counsel , or at any rate moral support . And another factor that tempered the annoyance of a breakdown was that in almost any hamlet it was possible to console oneself with a bottle of good cold beer . V Thanks to modern mass production and installment selling , the possession of luxuries no longer confers on any man the right to strut . This condition , tending as it does to damn up a natural instinct , forcing it to seek gratification through other channels , is deplorable . It would not be surprising to find , on closer investigation , that it has had something to do with the promotion of lawlessness . When a man could relieve his feelings of inferiority by buying a car and bragging about it he did not need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would display his name in the newspapers . Ownership of an automobile in the early days not only enhanced a man 's position in his community , but did much to strengthen or rehabilitate his authority in his own family circle . The most hen-pecked husband , by learning to drive , acquired a new power and a new prestige . He could do something that his wife could not do ; he had special knowledge she did not have . She might tell him how to conduct his business and his household or dictate the color and pattern of his suits and neckties . She might ? and doubtless did ? tell him which road to take , but she could not tell him how to run his car or how to fix it when it balked . The ears of the period were hard to start , hard to steer , and hard to stop . Driving them required more muscle and endurance than the average woman possessed . Keeping them in condition and making roadside repairs required more mechanical skill and technical knowledge than the average woman cared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own house , but at the wheel of his Whatnot Four he was a person . Magnificently arrayed in cap , linen duster , goggles , and gauntlets , clutching the wheel with a fierce nonchalance , he hurled his juggernaut over the road at twenty-five miles an hour , cheered by the thought that perhaps be had been made in God 's image , after all . But that happy state of affairs was not destined to last . Women could not long endure the ignominy of being relegated to the back seat . Eager to regain their lost ascendancy , they demanded cars which they , too , could drive . Scenting increased sales ? beside which the betrayal of their sex meant nothing ? the car-makers adopted a device that changed the whole aspect of motoring . This was the electric starter . With its advent the automobile was shorn of its masculinity . The engineers and designers , under pressure from the sales managers , gave up catering to male tastes . With one or two exceptions they stopped making cars that only he-men could control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for driving ; for the most part they could use their cars only on Saturdays and Sundays . Women , on the other hand , could motor every day . Daily use , obviously , would wear out a machine faster than weekend use . Therefore , if women want cars that are easy to handle , that need a minimum of gear-shifting , said the manufacturers , the thing to do is to give ' em what they want . To give women what they wanted required a revolution in design and salesmanship . When the man of the house was the customer , the salesman 's first move was to lift the hood of a car and show him the great bulk of the engine . Men did n't mind if the motor made some little noise ; that was evidence that it was there , on the job . Men wanted power in engines and axles strong enough to transmit it to the wheels . What matter if it did take muscle to crank a car and to hold it on the road , and skill to shift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's game . Ender the new order , salesmen switched their arguments and changed their tactics . Women did n't want to know what , if anything , was under the hood . They cared nothing for bores and strokes , for helical bevel gears and floating axles . The manufacturers having diverted money from mechanical features into " refinements , " the salesmen stopped talking motors , to talk color schemes and upholstery . They pointed out how easily the pedalscould be adjusted in length and how softly the clutch engaged ? " You simply ca n't make it grab , Moddom . " Moddom 's husband stood about awkwardly , feeling that he 'd been led into a lingerie shop , and yearning for some good old-fashioned technical conversation . But whenever he tentatively broached the subject of looking under the hood , the salesman shied off from it , as though motors were an indecent topic for mixed company , and called attention to the elegant flower vase , or the vanity case , or the tassels on the window curtains . After a time , Moddom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been taken away from him . He told himself that he did n't care ; that there was no longer much fun in driving anyway , because cars had become all looks and no guts . He took up golf . Among the many things the War changed was the motor car . New alloys , new knowledge of lubrication , of the combustion of gases , and of gasoline distillation combined to make possible the designing of cars radically different from their wartime predecessors . With enlarged factories tooled up for huge production , the car-makers were confronted by the slump of 1920 , when , except in the lowest-price classes , it was virtually impossible to give cars away . Those who were financially shaky succumbed . The others wrote off their losses and experimented . Out of their experiments came the forerunners of the automobiles of to-day . The new machines were , it is true , designed to please women . Ease of control , comfort , beauty of line and finish were part of their birthright ? but only a part . In addition they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had multicylindered motors under their hoods , motors that would bear inspection . They had four-wheel brakes , balloon tires , oil cleaners , air strainers , a host of mechanical innovations that men might examine and discuss . They brought back to driving some of the exciting quality it had lost . Some , but not all . The day had gone forever when a man could preen himself and say , " You know that steep hill at Wheresis ? Well , I took her all the way up in high ! " Climbing hills in high was no longer an achievement calling for driving skill . Any car could do it with a boy of sixteen at the wheel . VI To-day , according to the common view , we are living in the golden age of motoring . Perhaps it is a sign of advancing years , or of a crabbed disposition , that I can not whole-heartedly agree with that view . To my mind , with the post-war renaissance motoring lost much of its charm . I do not say that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still and always will have . But such moments , high spots , are becoming fewer and farther between . We have automobiles capable of running at fifty , sixty , seventy miles an hour all day long . We have roads ? here and there ? on which such speeds may safely be used . We have tires that wear for thousands and thousands of miles . We have filling stations , on main highways at least , every few yards . We can buy parts and have repairs made at standardized prices and flat rates in every town and village . We can buy nationally advertised fuels and lubricants everywhere . We can plan to drive any given distance in a specified time and be ninety-nine per cent certain of arriving on schedule . " Well , " I hear someone ask , " what more do you want ? " A fair question , to which I reply , " Nothing more . A trifle less . " I want what I can not possibly have . I should like , for instance , to be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a gasoline pump , a billboard , or a hot-dog stand . I should like to feel free to drive slowly , if I chose , without being honked at or sworn at by a scurrying horde . I should like to encounter , occasionally , a trace of the old-time courtesy of the road . I should like to see other motorists also enjoying leisurely drives ? as once they did ? instead of tearing along in a grim and purposeless frenzy . I think it would be agreeable to meet a few owners of small cars who were not intent on proving that they could travel as fast as bigger ones . I should like to meet , once in a while , a driver who knows that though mudguards are called fenders , the latter word is a misnomer . I should like to find some city in which most drivers , of their own volition , try to stop for red lights ; and some state in which they obey side-road full stop signs . I should like ? surely this person is mad ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mob and restored to the few who are mentally fit to indulge in it . It may be that I am not alone in deprecating the current craze for speed for speed 's sake . There may be others who also deplore the popular disdain for manners and who agree that the tempo of our life , as represented by the tempo of our motoring , might well be retarded without loss of national efficiency or personal enjoyment . There may be others ? and if there are , I extend them my sympathy . We 're caught in the traffic and there 's nothing we can do to check its onrush . Nor , I imagine , would we do anything to check it if we could . We have n't time . The fault , dear Brutus , is not in our cars , but in ourselves , that we are underlings.
