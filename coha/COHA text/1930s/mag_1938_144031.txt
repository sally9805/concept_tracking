Apart from the propensity for unending verbosity which is the heritage of the legal profession , the National Lawyers Guild whose political aims are very liberal has little in common with any other group of organized attorneys . Its second Annual Convention in Washington 's old Willard Hotel last week was less pretentious than the convention of a moderately prosperous labor union . With dinner jackets scarcer than paying clients , the 605 delegates , men and women , Negro and white , sat down to a two-dollar-a-plate banquet in the Willard 's Main ballroom and enjoyed roast turkey as much as the American Bar Association would have enjoyed breast of guinea hen . <P> For four days the young and earnest delegates listened to speeches , which had much more to do with economic justice than with legal justice . Guest speakers included : Solicitor-General designate Robert H. Jackson , Wisconsin 's Senator Robert M. La Follette and University of Wisconsin Law School Dean Lloyd K. Garrison , Representative Maury Maverick . <P> When all the resolutions were in , the program of the National Lawyers Guild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent by the President . <P> In its deep concern over general economic problems , the Guild did not ignore its own profession . Some 350 New York members of the Guild are either on relief or working for WPA . The Guild is still fighting for a WPA lawyers project as well as a new plan which amounts to group legal insurance : to set up " legal clinics " throughout the country . Hoped for net result : regular jobs for needy lawyers and justice for poor people with good cases . <P> With 5,000 members already on its books , the Guild put itself in the way of further increase in members by electing unanimously as its president a Justice of the New York Supreme Court , Ferdinand Pecora . Famed as the inquisitor of J. Pierpont Morgan during the Senate investigation of the Stock Exchange four years ago , Judge Pecora received the news in his pajamas in New York at midnight . At 3:30 a. m. he boarded a train for Washington and a few hours later assured the delegates that it was all a surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a National Executive Board of 64 which included Governors Elmer A. Benson of Minnesota and Philip F. La Follette of Wisconsin , C. I. O. General Counsel Lee Pressman , pudgy Joseph Padway , A. F. of L. General Counsel , and many of the well-known labor lawyers in the country . Secluded among the 64 was Guild Godfather Morris L. Ernst .
