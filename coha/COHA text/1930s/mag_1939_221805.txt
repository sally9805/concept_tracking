Nobody knows whether or not there is animal life on the planet Mars ; nobody knows whether or not it is possible to reach Mars with a radio signal . In 1924 a group of radio engineers trying to tune in Mars heard signals which they claimed they could not identify with an Earthly source . Last week , with Mars closer to the Earth than at any time since 1924 , another group of radio engineers tried a more daring experiment : sending a signal Marsward in the hope that it would be reflected back , picked up again on Earth . They thought they might succeed if : 1 ) the signal could penetrate the ionosphere , the ionized layer in the Earth 's atmosphere whose influence on radio waves is not thoroughly understood ; 2 ) it was not dissipated or destroyed on the way ; 3 ) it hit Mars ; 4 ) it was reflected toward Earth , and strong enough to be detected . <P> At the headquarters of Press Wireless , surrounded by the barren salt marshes off Baldwin , Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , good-natured Curator Clyde Fisher of Manhattan 's Hayden Planetarium , newshawks , photographers , announcers standing by to tell all . Before sending their signal , the engineers spent forty-five minutes twirling the knobs of 40 short-wave receivers , trying to catch a signal from Mars , where the highest form of life is generally believed to be some low form of vegetation , possibly resembling moss . Result : a potpourri of short-wave noises , most of them promptly identified . <P> Still hopeful , the engineers proceeded to the main experiment : a signal sent by remote control from a 100,000-watt transmitter 10 miles away at Hicksville , L. I. , the antenna of which pointed toward Mars at an angle of 30 . By common consent , the " message " was a meaningless succession of dots and dashes . Astronomer Fisher and associates figured that if the signal traveled 36,030,000 miles and back at 186,000 mi. a second , the round trip would take 6 min. 28 sec . The key was tapped . For 6 min. 28 sec. everyone waited . Nothing happened . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ben Bernie on . A few diehards argued that they had heard something , but officially the result of the experiment was " negative . " WOR 's Chief Engineer J. R. Poppele , who was in on the 1924 experiment , cheerfully announced that he would try again during Mars 's next " favorable opposition " to Earth ( in 1941 ) . <P> To the already long list of odds against the experiment , Astronomer Earl C. Slipher of Lowell Observatory had added another : his belief that it had been snowing on Mars last week .
