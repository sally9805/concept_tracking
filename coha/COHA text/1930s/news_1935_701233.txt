txt The Citizens Budget Commission charged yesterday that certain employes in the five borough offices of the Chief Medical Examiner have been illegally receiving and pocketing fees for services for which the city makes no charge . The collecting is going on at the rate of from $20,000 to $25,000 a year , it declared , the total collections since 1918 being estimated at a minimum of $170,000 and perhaps as high as I $400,000 . No fee system exists in the office , the commission explained , " but charges of from $2 to $5 , and in some instances running as high as $20 , are charged and retained by individual city employes for certified copies of proof of violent or sudden death , and also for copies of autopsy reports by members of the medical staff . " Charges are also made and retained for copies of stenographic minutes , the organization declared . Dr. Charles Norris , the chief medical examiner , said last nig14 that the report " is a joke to me . " I do n't know where they get any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The insurance companies occasionally want copies of the hearings , and they pay small fees for them , but we do n't get those requests at the rate of more than two a week , and the fee runs from fifty cents to a dollar . " Poor people come down and get copies of records free . " Asked if undertakers were forced to pay , Dr. Norris said that the undertakers tipped clerks in attempts to get little favors , but that the practice was something that was hard to stamp out , and certainly did not approach the status of a fee-collecting system . Dr. Norris was also asked if the furnishing of copies of papers and minutes of hearings was a service required by law of the clerks in the office . He indicated that in some cases it was and in other cases it was not . Investigation Is Promised . Paul Blanshard , Commissioner of Accounts , when informed of the charges , said that he would start an investigation immediately . The statement charged that the system had been in effect since Jan. 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislated out of existence . The commission urged that the city install a fee system , estimating that a charge of $1 for certified copies of proof of death and 5 cents a hundred words for copies of autopsy reports would yield the city $12,000 a year . " The charges , or so-called fees , are collected from insurance companies , undertakers and relatives or friends of the dead , " the commission said . " The tribute falls heaviest on the poorest people . Death certificates , with copies of autopsy reports , are required in insurance cases , the - majority of which are small industrial policies , coming usually from the poorer sections of the city . " More than fifty life and casualty insurance companies call for the death certificates , the autopsy 's findings and stenographic minutes , from the Chief Medical Examiner 's Office . The Prudential Insurance Company in the past three years and three months paid $2,327 for these certificates , reports and minutes . Relatives who , themselves , call in the offices are made to pay alleged fees . Undertakers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fees , with lamounts added , in their funeral 1 bills . " The Citizens Budget Commission is informed that collection and pocketing of the illegal charges is limited to a few employes in each of the five borough offices . The takings by individuals in the main office , in the Municipal Building , are said to exceed those in the other four boroughs . " 1 The commission , in support of its charges , quoted letters from insurance companies . giving the amount paid in fees in particular years , or else saying that while fees were paid the exact totals were not available . The commission computed the total amount collected , which , it said , may run as high as $400,000 for the seventeen-year period , by estimating that 40 per cent of the cases handled by the office call for the issuance of certified copies of papers of some sort . That percentage would amount to 85,400 cases . At the lowest rate charged in the unofficial fee system , $2 for a death certificate , this would amount to a minimum of $170,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having paid fees to the employes included the Prudential Insurance Company of America , the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company , the New Amsterdam Casualty Company , the United States Casualty Company , New York Life Insurance Company and several others .
