txt Blaming the Lawyers . To Me Editor of The New York Times : Because of much loose talk , lawyers are blamed for almost every ill the community suffers . Almost every American thinks he is somewhat of a lawyer himself and is quick to begin a legal contest on slight provocation ; hence our crowded calendars and much of the law 's delay . Business men who complain of lawyers ' shortcomings are generally only too ready to take advantage of legal technicalities if there is any profit in so doing , even against the advice of ' counsel . But of course the client is never a rascal ; it is always the lawyer . The legal profession submits to libels and slanders without publicly refuting them , probably because most lawyers believe it hopeless to combat a belief that has now become almost a tradition . OTTO HENSCHEL . New York , March 3 , 1932.
