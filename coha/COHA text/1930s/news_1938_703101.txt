txt The territory surrounding St. Paul and Minneapolis , Minn. , yesterday was the center of concentrated activity for the G-men who are seeking evidence to corroborate Peter Anders ' c nfession that he kidnaped Charles S. Ross and murdered both Ross and his own confederate in crime , James Atwood Gray . Although the government forces kept strict secrecy , there were well grounded reports 1 that the spot where the kidnaper had disposed of the bodies of the two slain men had been found within 100 miles of St. Paul , and probably near the Wisconsin border ; 2 that a third member of the kidnap band was in custody , and 3 that old friends of Anders who had helped in his previous crimes had been questioned . Await Takeoff for Chicago . There were indications last night that the investigation was nearing a successful conclusion and that the prisoner might be brought to Chicago early today .

Hunt Clews ' in Underworld . It was reported that some of the bank robberies In which Anders was involved took place in Minnesota , and information made public so far by Hoover indicates that he had close connections in the powerful Twin Cities underworld . It is assumed that after he had slain his victims and obtained the $50,000 that Mrs. Ross paid in a futile effort to save her husband 's life , Anders  --  and possibly the surviving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for refuge ind help in disposing of the money . Hoover had asserted that the killngs took place in Illinois and that le bodies of the slain men were dis . ) osed of " in another state . " This led , o a general belief that the burial Mace was in southern Wisconsin , where graves could be easily hidden in the rough lands of the Sugar river valley . Hideout Near St. Paul . But the persistence of the Gmen in spending at least thirty hours in Minnesota was almost enough to convince observers that the central point of the criminal work was close to St. Paul . The best hypothesis was that the hideout of the kidnapers was in that section . There was even a guess that Hoover has since learned he was mistaken  --  that , the double killing did not take place in Illinois . Lawyers in the district attorney 's office said they were assured by a source that they refused to reveal that " this case ' will be prosecuted in the federal court , " indicating that despite Mr. Hoover 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across state lines .

One or two of the ransom bills were passed at Belvidere . G-men were there at least six weeks ago looking for a hideout . It is significant that no further search was conducted in northern Illinois nor in the southern tier of Wisconsin counties in the last few days , while the activity in the St. Paul region has been intense .

He was to assist in getting rid of the hot money . Anders did not . keep his appointment , but Threalkill was arrested and supposedly is still in custody of the federal bureau . Some of the investiga.tio.i was centered yesterday on the identity of the go-between who arranged the meeting that never took place . Anders , it was recalled , had only $14,400 of the ransom cash with him when he was captured , and the whereabouts of the rest has not been disclosed .

At the Edgewater Golf club in Chicago it was said that a man who greatly resembled published pictures of Anders applied there for work as a greenskeeper last April .

Ross belonged to the club and it was suspected that perhaps some one who knew the members had pointed him out as a fit subject for kidnaping .
