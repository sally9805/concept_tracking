Wardrooms and British service clubs echoed with the news last week that " Ginger " Boyle was going to sea again , and in style . As Commander-in-Chief of the British Home Fleet , he will hold the second highest ranking post afloat in Britain 's navy . <P> For four years Admiral Sir William Henry Dudley Boyle has been ashore . Until last year as President of Britain 's Annapolis , the Royal Naval College , Greenwich , and Vice Admiral commanding the Royal Naval War College , he beat navigation , gunnery , seamanship and engineering into hundreds of young men . ' ' Gingrer " Boyle 's nickname comes from the fact that his hair , his eyes , his temper and his voice are all red . At 59 he snorts loudly at the elaborate technical training of modern midshipmen , is proud that he first went to sea at 14 , that though he is heir presumptive to the Earl of Cork and Orrery he acquired his entire education aboard the oldtime training ship Britannia .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
