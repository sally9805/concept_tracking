 | PETRA , silent city of the forgotten past , halfway between the Dead Sea and the Gulf of Aqaba , exerts a magic spell upon the minds of those fortunate enough to know it. * Its single and weird approach , through a deep rock cleft more than a mile long ; its temples , numbering nearly a thousand , cut into the living rock of stupendous cliffs and showing Babylonian , Egyptian , Greek , and Roman influence ; its high places , courts , libation basins , and altars where the ancients worshiped ; its amazing color , the work of Nature lavish with ocher and all shades of red ? all these are mysterious , enthralling . " The rose-red city , half as old as time , " has a history that began long before histories were written . Near it have been found worked flints of the Late Chellean period , millenniums before recorded dates . Its first written history is found in the Bible ; for the land about it was Mount Seir of old ( now Esh Shera ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hori , the grandson of Seir ( Gen. 36 : 20 ) . These Horites are first mentioned at the time of Abraham in connection with the subjugation of the land by Chedorlaomer ( Gen. 14 : 5-6 ) . Abraham had two sons : Isaac , father of the Hebrews in Canaan ( Gen. 25 : 19-26 ) , and Ishmael , of whom it was said , " he will be a wild man " ( Gen. 16 : 12 ) . From Ishmael sprang the Nabateans , a Bedouin people . CHILDREN OF ISHMAEL , ESAU , AND JACOB WARRED HERE When Isaac 's two sons , Jacob and Esau , quarreled , Esau migrated with his family and flocks to Mount Seir ( Esh Shera ) , and became the progenitor of the Edomites ( Gen. 36 : 6-8 ) . These were bitter enemies of the Hebrews , the descendants of Jacob 's twelve sons . Saul fought against the Edomites ( I Sam . 14 : 47 ) ; David subdued them , garrisoned their country , and dedicated their gold and silver , presumably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II Sam . 8 : 14 and I Chron. 18 : 11-13 ) ; and Solomon ruled them , though he felt their menace in his decline ( I Kings 11 : 1-16 ) . From the time of Saul , 1095 B. C. , till about 740 B. C. , Judah more or less dominated the Edomite country , but with the decline of Judah the descendants of Esau waxed powerful and gained territory . The  | Edomites themselves were driven out of the country around Petra or absorbed by the Nabateans , the Arab tribe descended from Ishmael . It was these Nabateans who made Petra their capital and wrought most of the monuments seen there to-day . For centuries Petra was a rich caravan city , a veritable crossroads of the ancient world . The Arabian Peninsula was a network of caravan routes , over which passed the products of Africa , Arabia , and India to the valley of the Nile , Palestine , Phoenicia , and the Euphrates-Tigris Valley ( see map , page 133 ) . Goods were brought to Petra for storage and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Romans built two road to tap its wealth . When Rome fell , however , its doom was sealed . Abandoned save for a few desert tribesmen , who lived miserably in its caves , as some of them still live , Petra passed from the notice of the outside world , remaining in oblivion for more than a thousand years . In 1812 the Swiss traveler , John Lewis Burckhardt , disguised as a Bedouin sheik . reached it and returned to tell of its mysteries . It had then become sacred ground to the Arabs , and danger menaced any Infidel who approached it ( p. 141 1 . In the century after Burckhardt , few explorers attempted to visit it . Not , indeed , until after the World War was it accessible to any save the most intrepid ; and even now visitors can not enter it save under protection of armed guards . With a comfortable camp for accommodation of guests during the summer months ( see illustration , page 159 ) , Petra at last is open to serious travelers , though off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Petra and back once required about a month of arduous caravan travel through country infested with lawless Bedouins . Construction of the Mecca Railway from Damascus ( Daman ) to the sacred city of Medina was a first step toward opening the country , and later a highway from Jerusalem to Maan and a smooth dirt road from Ma'an to Elji brought motor vehicles within two miles of the ancient city . Airplanes , too , now carry passengers to Maan , bound for Petra ( see page 137 ) .  | When the British cleared the way for automobiles between Ma'an and Elji , the Bedouins rose in open revolt , complaining that the road would deprive them of their income from renting saddle animals to Petra visitors ( see illustration , page 142 ) . Warfare ensued , several persons of both sides losing their lives . After the Government had crushed the rebellion by armed force , the Bedouins received assurance that the road would not be extended beyond Elji , and that their horses and mules would be hired under Government supervision for the last part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transportation from actually infringing on the silence of long ago and preserved for Petra a measure of its isolation . VISITING THE MONUMENTS OF PETRA However we travel to Petra , whether by railroad from Damascus , a method almost disused ; or by car from Jerusalem , the most practical way ; or by air , the latest innovation , all routes converge on Ma'an , a thriving adobe village girdled with walled gardens of palms , figs , and vegetables , and surrounded by flat , chalky white desert . There is an English school here , and visitors are often amazed to find that many of the Arab youths understand and speak English . From Ma'an we drive northwest by car , passing the spring of Ain Musa , to Elji . Here a happy crowd of Bedouins , with emaciated riding horses and pack mules , awaits our arrival , which has been heralded over the telephone to the Elji police station . Mark Twain named the horse he used through the Holy Land " Baalbeck " ? " because it was a magnificent ruin . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the elements have been most severe and erosion has left little semblance of the original beauty of contour . Possibly " Erodia " or " Antiqua " would be suitable names for our mares . Elji is a village of storage hovels ; for the natives live summer and winter in goat-hair tents , migrating from the cool plateaus in summer to the warm valleys in winter . They cultivate grain and vegetables on narrow terraces irrigated by the waters of Ain Musa ( Moses ' Spring ) .  | We leave Eiji under the escort of a mounted Arab police officer and a Bedouin guide , both armed . Over the police station floats the Trans-Jordan flag , though our equipment is English . We desert the few reminders of modern civilization and travel back through 2,000 years of history . Descending first by slippery trails over limestone rock , we follow the bed of Wadi Musa to a mighty barrier , the eastern range of the red sandstone mountains that enclose Petra . Wadi Musa deepens . It seems that we are entering a cul-de-sac , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow opening . For this long slit the Arabs have coined the name Es Siq ( a cleft ) . Through it the fountain and flood waters flow in winter , and after traversing the precincts of Petra city find their way into Wadi el Araba by another greater gorge , the Wadi es Siyagh ( see page 165 ) . Approaching the gateway , Bab es Siq ( see illustration , page 145 ) , we pass through a small suburb of Petra , without the precincts of the fortified city . This was a city of the dead , as was most of what is left of Petra . Objects of interest are tombs of the pylon type , cut from the solid rock , but , unlike the facade monuments of Petra proper , blocked out to stand apart as buildings . Here , too , are scattered white sandstone hummocks , rock domes into which large numbers of small chambers have been cut without facades . Many of like character are found on the less accessible mountain tops . They are believed to be the troglodyte homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descendants of Esau made Edom of it . @# At Bab es Siq we find the remains of an ingenious tunnel cut through the mountain to the north . This , with the aid of a dam , drained off and carried back to the Wadi Musa floods that would have filled the Siq and isolated the city in times of storm . Though now one usually traverses the Siq dry-shod , I have ridden through it with the water splashing my horse 's knees . One such trip makes clear the purpose of the ancient tunnel .  | The Siq is 6,000 feet long as the crow flies and considerably longer as it winds . Once it was all paved , and channels were cut into its precipitous sides to lead the spring water into the city . It is 20 feet wide in its narrowest parts and expands to not more than two or three times this dimension . Its sides are stupendous , making men mere ants by comparison . In no place may we see far ahead , crooks and corners preventing . A streak of blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the heavens ( see illustration , page 146 ) . At every turn we hear in fancy the tinkling of bells and dream of a long caravan winding its way through , strong with the scent of perfumes , frankincense , and myrrh . Niched in the walls are small shrines as votive offerings to a deity for a safe return from a long journey . Our horses slip over the great boulders that choke this ancient avenue , our Bedouins chanting their weary and melancholy notes . A horse stumbles ; they call to Allah to uphold it and continue their songs of love . Our police escort gallops his nimble chestnut stallion over a terrain where another horse would break its neck ; he is just showing off . A TEMPLE TO AN UNKNOWN GOD After 20 minutes of this bewitching seclusion , we strain our eyes for a first glimpse of the vision we know awaits us . Even though we watch , it bursts upon us as a surprise . The Siq ends abruptly in a cross-gorge . From the face of the cliff opposite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temple to an unknown deity . It peeps at us at first ( see page 150 ) , we see a little more , and then it bursts upon us in all its beauty ( see page 151 ) . This cross-canyon has been called the " Outer Siq . " The name " Lower Siq " may fit it better . Its walls are equally precipitous . To the south its valley floor rises abruptly to the mountain top on which the Great High Place of Sacrifice is located . Steps have been cut at no little expenditure of energy to make easy the ascent of the worshiper . To the north the Outer Siq expands , opening into the Petra basin . I shall always remember my first view of El Khazna . I had journeyed with a party to Petra from Jerusalem via Beersheba , across the Araba up to Mount Hor ( Jebel Harun ) and Petra in scorching June-July weather . Water holes were sand-choked.  | In those early days ( 1905 ) we dared not camp at wells because of the fear of marauding Bedouins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent visits . As we started our last day 's march , we were told that early in the day we should reach Ain et Taiyibe ( The Good Spring ) . With mouths parched and appetites whetted by the prospects of a deep draft after days of prolonged thirst , we reached the spring ? only to find it dry . Had it not been for a cave in the wadi bed full of rain water , our mules and horses must have perished . They had gone 24 hours without water , under trying conditions , and still had a good 12 hours ' stiff climb to Petra and water . After 15 hours of repeated unloading and loading of the mules where the trail between rock cliffs was too narrow to let them pass , we reached our destination . I drove the last two camels into a camp pitched in the Roman theater ( see text , page 134 ) . Frantic with thirst , I ran to a place in the valley above where I was told there was  | cool running water . I fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my lips . In tilting my head to drink , I caught my first glimpse of El Khazna ! The sight was so awe-inspiring and unexpected that I dropped the water and stared . How long it was before I came out of the spell I do not know . The thing was so beautiful as to pain the senses . I can remember no other occasion when I was so affected . THE MONUMENTS OF PETRA Throughout Petra there are possibly nearly 1,000 monuments . The majority of these are Nabatean ( see text , page 129 ) and therefore of special interest . About 25 are classical , made after Greek and Roman influence had become dominant . These few are by far the largest and most imposing , although archeologically not the most interesting . Petra , it must be remembered , became a city with far-flung trade routes about the sixth century B. C. and endured for nearly 1,000 years . From its monuments has been gleaned most of what is known of its history , and I shall let pictures of these relics tell their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we come to the Roman theater. which is best seen from the cliff across the white wadi bed . Its benches , somewhat less than a semicircle , provided seating capacity for between 3,000 and 5,000 persons . That it was made at a later date than the Nabatean tombs is clear from the fact that its architects hewed away some of them . Their minor chambers , without the original facades , are seen in its back walls ( pp. 147 and 162 ) . Leaving the theater , we take a westerly course and tread upon the precincts of the old city of Petra , little of which remains above ground . Test excavation shafts reveal some standing walls , but most of the houses have fallen in . Along the banks of Wadi Musa was the main avenue , and here we see the remains of a triple triumphal arch , probably from the Roman period . Following the traces of this ancient highway along the wadi , we come to the only building standing in Petra , a large Roman temple called Qasr el Bint ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserved ( see page 159 ) . Naturally , the timbered tiled roof is gone , but of the masonry itself only the four great columns that formed the  | front of the pronaos are lacking . Except for the bases , which still stand , they lie scattered where they fell . RESTFUL SLEEP IN A TOMB A comfortable tent camp has been set up between this ruin and the small , isolated hill of El Habis ( see illustrations , pages 149 and 163 ) . If we like , we may sleep in one of the tents , or we may seek repose in a cave tomb . One of the most comfortable beds here is a pallet of fresh oleander boughs , pink with thousands of blooms that would cost a fortune in a Fifth Avenue flower shop , covered with a layer of dried grasses , and topped with a couple of blankets and a pillow . In the one-time abode of the dead , dead tired , we sleep after a happy day . " Only too short an entombment , " wrote one traveler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one emerges from the Siq into Petra , one receives the impression that the city site is a blind pocket entirely surrounded by high mountains . But the two ranges of sandstone mountains , running approximately northeast and southwest and enclosing the dead city , Nature has cracked asunder , the eastern by Es Siq and the western by Wadi es Siyagh . The flood waters of Wadi Musa flow through these openings , falling in cascades from the Siyagh gorge , but mostly evaporating and becoming lost before reaching the Araba . Between the ranges the ancients constructed two city walls ? one the north and the other the south limit of Petra . Gates in these walls afforded the only means of ingress other than Es Siq , for the Wadi es Siyagh was impassable . As thus enclosed , the city was some two miles square , its area bisected by the Wadi Musa ( see map , page 132 ) . The eastern mountain range north of Es Siq is the solid block of El Khubdha . Along its high cliffs the largest of the classical monuments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The same range , south of Es Siq , is much split up by ravines . Of its peaks the most important is Zibb Atuf , on which is the Great High Place of Sacrifice ( see page 158 ) . At its base are El Khazna , the theater , and many of the early Nabatean tombs .  | The western range north of Es Siyagh is called Jebel ed Der ( Mountain of the Monastery ) . It was a classic monument that in later times became a place of Christian worship ( see page 157 ) . AN IMPREGNABLE STRONGHOLD South of Es Siyagh the most imposing mountain of all , Umm el Biyara ( probably Mother of Cisterns ) , rears its flat top ( see pages 149 and 163 ) . It was a Nabatean stronghold , inaccessible except by the aid of a sort of staircase in a couloir that was closed by a gate ( see pages 130-1 ) . In cisterns hollowed from the rock , its defenders stored water for use in case of prolonged siege . The Greek historian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relates that the Nabateans had no built homes , but raised sheep and camels , using the latter instead of horses ; trafficked in frankincense , myrrh , and costly spices , and loved liberty . He describes their cistern-equipped rock fastness with only one way up and gives vivid accounts of two expeditions sent fruitlessly against them by Antigonus . By using tactics like those attributed to the Nabateans , Col. T. E. Lawrence ( T. E. Shaw ) , with a small band of desert-bred Arabs , harassed a whole Turkish army corps during the World War . He would place explosives on the Mecca Railway and retreat to just such an eyrie . It is probable that the Edomites , before the Nabateans , had defenses on Umm el Biyara when they refused to let Israel through their borders . The story is told in Numbers 20 : 14-18 : " And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom , Thus saith thy brother Israel , . . . Let us pass , I pray thee , through thy country : we will not pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will we drink of the water of the wells : we will go by the king 's high way , we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left , until we have passed thy borders . ' " And Edom said unto him , Thou shalt not pass by me , lest I come out against thee with the sword . ' "  | Because of this churlish refusal , Hebrew writers were ever denouncing the Edomites . Jeremiah says : " Thy terribleness hath deceived thee , and the pride of thine heart , 0 thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock , that holdest the height of the hill : though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle , I will bring thee down . . . . Edom shall be a desolation : every one that goeth by it shall be astonished " ( Jer. 49 : 16-17 ) . The prophet may well have been picturing the topography of Petra and particularly this high mountain fastness . In a psalm attributed to David , who longed to conquer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we read : " Who will bring me into the strong city ? who will lead me into Edom ? " ( Psalm 108 : 10 ) . King Amaziah of Judah made war against the children of Seir and took Selah ( Petra ) , smiting ten thousand . " And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry away captive , and brought them unto the top of the rock , and cast them down from the top of the rock , that they all were broken in pieces " ( II Chron. 2 5 : 12 ) . Could this " top of the rock " have been Umm el Biyara ? The bed of a winter torrent runs around the eastern base of Umm el Biyara , forming a V with Wadi Musa , where they enter the gorge of Es Siyagh . Within this V we find the little rock of El Habis , where the camps are located ( see illustrations , pages 149 and 163 ) . It is honeycombed with sepulchers and crowned with a castle , whence it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE WATER SUPPLY OF PETRA The short trip through Wadi es Siyagh , as far as it is practicable to go , is a lovely evening stroll . We pass between towering cliffs by the wadi full of oleanders , their pink blossoms , in season , contrasting with the hues of the walls of rock . The sun lights up one cliff , leaving the other in shade . We come to a little spring that bubbles from the pebbles , falls over a cliff , and disappears in a streamlet among the ragged rocks where we can not follow it . This spring , along with a smaller one in the valley higher up and the waters of Ain Musa , that came into the city by means of the Siq channel , furnished the main water supply of Petra . Near our Habis camp are a couple of interesting monuments : the columbarium and the " unfinished tomb " ( see page 149 ) . The so - called " columbarium " is one chamber within another , the walls covered with 10-inch cubical holes like post-office boxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pigeons , as some suppose , and we have no reason to believe that the Petreans cremated their dead . The unfinished tomb merits study , for it reveals how the monuments were made . Few of the natural cliffs were absolutely perpendicular . Artisans started blocking out on a rock shelf and then finished off their work before cutting down to a lower layer . On these high ledges the Nabatean stonecutters must have drawn and completed their designs much as advertisement skyscraper artists do . Where the parts to be removed were massive , they quarried out building stones and then chipped the surface to design . A CRUSADER FORTRESS ON A HILL An excursion that agile climbers should not miss is that to the top of El Habis , " The Acropolis . " From the camp chambers we ascend by winding paths cut into the eastern face of El Habis , and over a precipice of Wadi es Siyagh to a small flat plateau beyond . Two small gullies lead us thence to the summit . All of the Petra city site is at our feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here there are masonry ruins called by some scholars Roman and by others Crusader ( see illustration , page 136 ) . We know that King Baldwin I constructed at Petra a castle called Selah , the Bible name for Petra ( II Kings 14 : 7 ) . He was following the old idea of controlling and taking toll from the caravan routes . Another interesting climb is to the top of Zibb Atuf . We leave the camp at El Habis and proceed west and south along the base of Umm el Biyara to the southern section of the eastern range . Bearing to the south to miss Es Siq , we pass up one of many wadis. that of El Farasa , a cleft that divides El Farasa mountain from Zibb Atuf , on the Obelisk Ridge . The walls of the glen heighten and its floor narrows almost to nothing , becoming increasingly steeper as we advance . Hereabout are a number of monuments of the classical type , small but rather well  | preserved . To our right is the Tomb of the Statues , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eroded that it gives no indication as to whether it ever had a carved facade . Within the latter we find the only decorated chamber in Petra ( see page 160 ) . Not distant is the Tomb of the Three Urns , its pedimented roof carrying three urns supported by two pilasters with quarter columns . Farther up , where the wadi contracts considerably , is a small classic monument known as the Farasa Temple . In front of it a considerable plot has been cleared , which gave it the name of the Garden Tomb , though it is definitely not a tomb . Its two pillars , supporting three arches , form a portico , beyond which is a small room lighted and ventilated from one side by a window . THE GREAT HIGH PLACE OF SACRIFICE About the base of Zibb Atuf are the largest numbers of earlier Nabatean tombs and a couple of interesting altars , the latter undoubtedly placed here because of the sanctity of the mountain on the top of which is the Great High Place of Sacrifice . The exact purpose of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had to do with religious observances . Above it is a great tank for rain water . If we called it a " chapel , " the word would probably better convey to us its original purpose . One can not wander leisurely about Petra without marveling at the amount of labor expended on steps , water runlets , aqueducts. basins , reservoirs , and cisterns . Especially do we find these in proximity to places of cult , high placed though most of them are . The top of Zibb Atuf is reached by further climbing and rock-cut stairs . Here we are greeted by the unusual and unexpected sight of two mighty obelisks ( see page 153 ) . A closer inspection reveals that the whole of the surface of the mountain has been quarried away , leaving the obelisks standing . Just beyond is a ryas , or small rock hill , reached by a steep flight of rock steps . This is the Great High Place of Sacrifice .  | Sunk into the surface of the uneven rock is a large court surrounded by low benches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One , almost square , with a step leading to it , is placed opposite the middle of the court . A deep , narrow trench has been cut around it , forming three of its sides , and at the same time cutting it loose from The rock that falls away abruptly to the terrace below . The surface is uneven . South of this big altar is a smaller one with a large flat surface and four hewn steps leading to it ( see illustration , page 158 ) . Into its top a depression has been cut , a circle within a circle . At the bottom a hole pierces the side , draining into a small channel that empties on to the court . South of the court is a slightly lower terrace with a pool and channels arranged to catch rain water and drain off the surplus . Such is the Great High Place of Sacrifice . What rites it once witnessed can only be conjectured . There are other similar high places in Petra , but all apparently of less importance . THE NABATEAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun god Dushara , whose symbol was an uncut black stone . Allat , the great mother goddess of Arabia , was his mother and consort . All over Petra of which we see carved niches containing pillars or large separate monoliths representing Dushara . These were placed near graves , along roadways , in temples , up steep stairways , just as the cross is placed by Christians . The black stone of the Kaaba in Mecca , the kissing of which is part of the Moslem pilgrim ritual , is one of these Dushara. * This cult object has been taken over by the Moslems much as the Christmas tree has been borrowed by Christians from a pagan festival . The only Dushara stone still in use in these parts is one in the mosque of Jebel Harun , the Moslem shrine of Aaron , west of Petra . This site is so sacred that no non-Moslem is allowed to enter or even approach its holy precincts . It was to this shrine that Burckhardt vowed a goat as a sacrifice ? an act that led to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I first visited Petra , the country was quite unsafe . y , Jerusalem ige copper for to the the food andfuls of : AVAN STRONGHOLD 141 Still , a companion and I ventured with our two Beersheba guides up to the top of Jebel Harun ( the Mountain of Aaron ) . The guides had become very friendly and risked the consequences with us . The going was steep and rocky , but our ponies carried us almost to the top . We dismounted and scrambled up a knoll on the summit of which was a small mosque with a whitewashed dome . AN ANCIENT PILGRIM RENDEZVOUS A large antique cistern at the base of this rock showed us that in ancient times the spot had been much used by pilgrims . Below the shrine an open natural cave contained three copper caldrons for seething the sacrifice , one so huge as to contain the meat from a whole camel . Later , as we descended , pilgrims met us with sheep and goats that they brought here to kill and eat in fulfillment of a vow . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered the " Holy of Holies . " Within was a built tomb covered with a dark-green cloth . This , according to Moslem tradition , is where Aaron was buried . From the ceiling hung some eggs of the wild ostriches of the Syrian and North Arabian deserts . We saw on the cenotaph an inscription in Arabic as well as one in Hebrew . Built into the masonry of the north wall , about five feet from the floor , we saw a black stone of greenish hue that had been kissed to a shiny surface ? a counterpart of the black stone at Mecca . Both are Dushara . As we prepared to leave , our guides spied a party of hostile Bedouins converging on us from afar . A scout had seen the Infidels and given the alarm . Hurriedly but carefully , on their knees , our men smoothed over every footprint in the sand that covered part of the floor , as they backed out to the door . We got halfway down before the Arabs reached the base . They let off a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrath of the Turkish Government . This experience may give a key to the riddle of the Great High Place of Sacrifice . According to a Greek writer , the sacred image of Dushara kept in the central sanctuary of Petra was four feet high by two square , and uncut . The idea that the square altar of the Great High Place was the base of this Dushara image becomes increasingly  | interesting when one thinks that the unusual shape and socketlike depression in the altar top might have been so chipped to fit an uncut stone of such dimensions . Whatever the use of the altar , it faces directly on Jebel Harun , the most holy mountain , probably hallowed before Israel started wandering , when Aaron died atop a mountain in the borders of Edom ( Numbers 20 : 22-27 ) . The idea of offering a sacrifice in view of a sacred mountain without actually going to it , as Burckhardt did , is a prevalent one . We have here , then , twin altars possibly dedicated , as has also been suggested of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabia . The round altar has the appearance of being one on which goats and sheep were slain , the blood caught and poured out before the Dushara . The idea of the whole burnt sacrifice , so well fixed in the Western mind , is only one form , the less usual one practiced by the ancient Hebrews . More commonly the flesh was cooked and eaten at the sanctuary . This is the form that all blood sacrifices took , originating in a dim past , perpetuated until to-day in these countries . Both Moslems and Samaritan Jews smear the blood as part of their ritual. * On the flat court before this altar is a small raised platform , the probable use of which has caused no little discussion . It seems logical to think of it as reserved for the officiating priest . Around the court are the raised seats where the sacrificial gathering would sit and partake of the feast . Thus the Nabateans perpetuated the form of worship that , without doubt , the Edomites practiced before them . From the Great High Place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet another glimpse of " Pharaoh 's Treasure House , " El Khazna . CARAVAN STOREHOUSES AND TEMPLES Passing the theater , we come to El Khubdha , the northern section of the eastern range . Here a spear of the mountain at the lower Siq is carved with some excel-  | lent examples of the corniced type of facade . Along the lower extremities of the Siq gorge , just before it opens into the great valley , are rooms with large cavities cut into their walls . It has been suggested that , being on the main highway at the entrance to Petra , these were the storehouses or shops in which the frankincense , gold , myrrh , aloes , cinnamon , and spicery were unloaded from the camels coming from Arabia , to be sold and recaravanned to points east , north , and west . El Khubdha has the highest rock faces of all those about Petra ; consequently , at the period of greatest prosperity , the most pretentious temples were carved upon its west facade . Here are the Urn Temple ( see page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North of these are the so-called " Corinthian tomb " and the largest monument of all , the Palace ( see page 154 ) . Some three hundred paces again to the north is an ornate tomb known to be that of a certain Sextus Florentinus , a Roman officer of the time of Antoninus Pius . Near this tomb is the northern boundary of Petra ; for here the crooked Nabatean wall started across the valley to the opposite western range . A ROMAN TEMPLE ON A HEIGHT We leave camp early for the climb to Ed Der , nearly 600 feet above the city level ( see pages 134 , 157 , and 158 ) . The valley , Wadi ed Der , that we follow is full of smaller monuments . Its walls become precipitous and close together , much like the lower Siq . Huge staircases , wider and more pretentious , often cut through masses of rock , are here encountered . Were it not for fallen rocks blocking the route and other parts being eroded away , the road , though very steep , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance to the valley we usually find the few remaining families of the Bdul Bedouins living . They have no homes , no tents , the few clothes , usually in tatters , on their backs being their most valued possession besides the rags they sleep on . Often the children are quite naked . They eat barley , pounded into flour in holes in the rock and baked on ashes . Two meals a week suffice to prolong their existence . A few goats may be a family 's sole source of livelihood . 144 THE NATIONAL 0E0 (  | On our way up , one monument claims our attention and we make a short detour to reach it . It is a small classical facade known as the " Tomb of the Lions . " The pedimented top is supported by a pair of pilasters supplemented by quarter columns . The capitals are Nabatean of a decorated and developed type . Above the capitals are two Medusa faces . The monument gets its name from the lions carved on each side of the door . Higher up , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to the left . Here we come to a rock ledge overhung by a cliff and dropping into a chasm . From the overhanging rock , covered with maiden-hair ferns , water continually drips , and small tunnels have been made to conduct it into pools . We are hot and fagged on reaching this point , and the refreshingly cool drink is welcome . We rest on the stone seats of a triclinium in the shade of a rock-cut chamber . Along the walls are carved niches and cult objects , an inscription and a cross of later date . The Der itself is not on the highest point of this range , but is rather on a.plateau overlooking the great Araba rift directly facing Mount Hor ( Jebel Harun ) . Carved from finely grained sandstone , it is better preserved than most of the monuments . There was no cliff here ; therefore a whole section of the mountain side had to be removed , leaving a great flat space in front ( see page 157 ) . AN EARLY ALTAR OF GREAT SANCTITY Not far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Facing Mount Hor ( Jebel Harun ) as it does , it may have been at an early time a place of great sanctity . Ed Der is clearly a Roman temple that quite likely superseded , and in its construction demolished , many of the ancient cult cuttings that we should expect to find here , similar to those at the Great High Place of Sacrifice on the Zibb Atuf . If this niche in Ed Der at one time held a Dushara , the idol would naturally have been removed by the Christians , just as the Moslems must have removed all Christian altars and appurtenances of worship . Beyond Ed Der is a small tomb on the face of which a couple of camels and men are carved . These are so eroded as not to be readily distinguishable . Near by are many cisterns and rain-water catchments , indicating that large numbers of people frequented this temple . My first trip to Petra , in 1905 ( see page 133 ) , was slow and dangerous . I have revisited the place many times . My last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surpassed my wildest expectations in beauty of scenery , intimate views and placings of the ancient monuments , and unique experience . FLYING OVER PETRA Our party breakfasted on the shores of the Sea of Galilee ( see map , page 133 ) . The day had dawned fair . Soon , however , enormous black clouds like demon heads , thundering cursings and spitting forth firebrands of lightning , came racing through the Pigeon Valley ( Wadi el Hamam ) and floated over the lake that a few moments before was " Blue Galilee . " Motors raced us through a howling gale along the lake shore , through Tiberias , to the wind-swept natural airport of Samakh. at the southern end of the lake . New Testament history tells us of these sudden Galilean storms which subside just as suddenly . Ducking our heads into the gale , we crossed the airdrome and mounted the plane . A dozen men and officers clung to the machine 's wings while others emptied the anchor bags . Captain Mahoney of the Royal Air Force climbed aboard and soon we raced away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . First circling over the lake , we headed down the Jordan Valley . As we sped down toward the Dead Sea , we literally flew below the surface level of the sea , for the Dead Sea is nearly 1,300 feet below mean sea level . ACROSS THE JORDAN VALLEY @# The Jordan Valley behind , we raced diagonally across the Dead Sea and faced the precipitous sandstone cliffs of its eastern shore halfway down . Volcanic eruptions had poured molten black basalt over the bright-red rocks . Wind , rain , and stream had chiseled away the surplus , leaving varicolored monarchs standing erect . with crowns of black , their feet in the bluest of waters . Here we crossed the narrow Siqlike chasm through which flows the River Arnon ( Wadi el Mojib ) , and soon rolling , rocky uplands , cut through by deep wadis , were flying by below . Here and there were deep red patches where cultivated fields had been freshly plowed in the valleys . Scattered about were camps of Bedouin goat-hair  | tents . Silhouetted against the sky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon plowing the rocky brink of a yawning abyss . Before we knew it , we were flying through and up a large valley . At its head were terraced gardens and orchards , with El Kerak perched above . We circled the town several times , looking deep into its Crusader moat and seemingly flying level with the castle walls that had kept Crescent and Cross apart in many a long-fought siege . Presently the ravine-cut terrain changed into vast expanses of desert plateau . We were flying over the Syrian Desert , the northernmost extremity of the Arabian Peninsula , now the British protectorate of Trans-Jordan . This treeless desert was tan and yellow , with blue tints shading into black and broad ivory-colored wadi beds . We picked up the Pilgrim Railroad , laid from Damascus to the Prophet 's shrine at Medina. * The desert rolled away to an interminable east ; to the west a low range blocked the view of the Araba ( see map , page 133 ) . This westerly range presently heightened and became covered with a scrub-oak thicket . We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still , as we suddenly turned westward to cross this wooded range , we seemed just to escape scraping the gnarled tree-tops , so high is this plateau . With breath-taking surprise a view burst upon us , never to be forgotten , probably never to be outdone ! CHROMATIC PETRA FROM THE AIR We were now above the jagged , dazzlingly colorful twin ranges between which Petra lies and of which it is a part ( see text , page 135 ) . Beyond , westward , stretched the deep expanse of the Araba , blue-tinted , remote , and forbidding . Here the sandstone held more of the yellow , tan , and ivory tints ; but as we traveled south toward the Petra ruins , the colors changed to more vivid reds . We flew between these ranges , gigantic piles of fascinating shapes and color . First to be recognized of Petra 's monuments straight ahead was Qasr el Bint , the Roman masonry temple standing alone in the valley at the base of El Habis , the " Acropolis " hill ( see text , pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger classical monuments in the facades of El Khubdha flashed by on the left ( p. 142 ) . We crossed the western range and Ed Der seemed to look up at us . When climbing up to it from the valley bed , one seems to feel that the top of the range has been about reached . The air view changes this impression . Through Wadi es Siyagh , amid wisps of clouds we flew , and emerged with a full view of the Araba . Following along this western range , we soon sighted its highest peak , Jebel Harun , dominating its southern extremity . We circled thrice at very close range the white dome of Aaron 's tomb , as if imitating the Moslem tawaf , the pilgrim 's ceremony of circling the Kaaba ( see text , page 141 ) . SCANNING " INACCESSIBLE " PEAKS As we swung back we passed over the Petra Valley again , the flat top of Umm el Biyara , Petra 's most ancient stronghold , lying close to the left . We circled so low over the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pages 130-1 , 149 , and 163 ) . I now felt that my youthful aspirations and longings to climb every inaccessible peak to be sure that there were no new discoveries to make had been fully satisfied . Flying over the Great High Place of Sacrifice , Captain Mahoney piloted the plane so low that the court , altars , and other details could be clearly pointed out . In circling , we repeatedly crossed and recrossed the Siq . We could see straight down into this most romantic of fissures , once the highway of desert caravans . The day 's ride had been fairly comfortable , but over Petra we experienced some severe bumps . Part of the time the wind blew so violently that it became dangerous to open the window to take pictures . The novelty of flying over the Siq was to me possibly the most thrilling . One might see and geographically place any of the monuments by climbing to them , but of the depth and character of the Siq no adequate conception could be had except from the air . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Siq ! There is the Siq ! " only to look back and find my two young nieces really sick . Since then they have never ceased to chide me about it . As we flew from the High Place eastward , we could distinguish our horses and Bedouin escort at the police post at Eiji waiting to take us to Petra . Down the mountain road rolled the car carrying our camp , well timed . 164 THE NATIONAL 6E01  | Presently landing on the Royal Air Force field at Ma'an , again we experienced British hospitality ? tea and good cheer around an open fireplace . Only once has Petra been entered by means other than the caravan . Wing Commander F. O. Soden , of the Royal Air Force at Jerusalem , then stationed in Amman ( ancient Philadelphia ) , landed his own small plane in the valley of Petra near a caravan halt of the ancient metropolis . This feat , one that would defy any but such an intrepid pilot , will probably not be repeated soon . In due course our waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Petra , after our luncheon at Ain Musa ( Moses ' Spring ) . The day was now waning . Across the sky rolled great clouds , the softer light lending beauty and adding enchantment to the great red and buff cliffs , as we filed through the Siq and wound our way toward our cave camp in the Acropolis hill . It now started to drizzle . We stopped at El Khazna . Its reflected color in the evening light beggars description . In passing we visited the theater and took a fleeting glance at the many interesting monuments , but the threatening sky hurried us on . Scarcely had we reached our night 's abode ? rooms that had been carved into the bowels of this fortress rock two thousand and more years ago ( page 135 ) ? when the rain came down in torrents . Luckily , during the short twilight the sky cleared and we sauntered about the Acropolis hill . SUNSET PLAYS A COLOR SYMPHONY We were in no mood to examine architectural or historical details ; rather , we reveled in the unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects . Our camp was in a double-roomed chamber , possibly a triclinium , with door and window openings . In the outer one , where supposedly the ancients held religious feasts , we supped around a stone table ; the inner one was to be the abode of the ladies . Our escort , with his mount and Bedouin guide , contented themselves with sharing a rockhewn cavern below that was accessible to the horse , where they controlled the only rock-cut ascent to our camp . As we dined and whiled away the early hours of the now black night , rain came down in sheets , and we could hear from our lofty perch the rumbling of the wadi torrents . Without sharing my anxiety except with Deif-Allah ( the Guest of God ) , I visualized the water so deep in the Siq that escape for a day or two might be impossible . While I was musing thus , the policeman ran up to say that his mare had run away ; and , taking a flashlight , he raced down the cliffs in pursuit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping a bonfire of oleander wood blazing without our chambers on a terrace but little protected from the elements . A CALL FOR HELP ! Presently there came a long-echoed call for help . A little reticent , but in obedience to the single word of command , Deif-Allah plunged into the darkness , mumbling his disgust at police efficiency and training . The police officer returned drenched , reporting the Siq " flowing deep enough to carry away a camel , " and his horse heading for home at Eiji . He looked the picture of despair . Presently Deif-Allah 's song was heard above the roar of the streams resounding through the gorges . The policeman 's downcast face lost its look of abject woe . His horse was caught ; otherwise the Arab would not be singing . Soon the Bedouin was back poking the fire and shaking out the water from his black curls . One word and look told me that Petra 's gate was inviolably closed ; the stream had swollen beyond the possibility of escape . During the night I awoke to find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The waters of Wadi Musa coming through the Siq had abated ; the other streams were still deep . On arriving in camp , I caught our chauffeur , cook , and general handy man about to sacrifice a small white cock to the god of soup , but its life was spared , and canned soup , minus chicken , was served . As I went to bed in a small cave higher up , the little rooster lay with his legs tied tightly together , looking rather miserable . I tethered him by a yard of cord to my cot leg ; he perched on a stone , and I dropped to sleep . At the first streak of dawn the little fellow crowed incessantly , as if his heart was bursting with joy to see a new day . Still fatigued from the two days and nights of desert drive , the loading and unloading of the mules , and the arranging of the camp . the chauffeur emitted a stream of Arabic PETRA , ANCIENT CARAVAN STRONGHOLD 165  | curses at the rooster , ending with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music box , " wherewith he buried his head again in the pillow . Never could Petra be more beautiful than it was that morning , bathed clean of desert dust , the multicolored sandstone soaked with rain that accentuated every shade and tint , the sky blue and cloudless . The trip out by horse and mule brought back to my mind the old days of the long caravan journey from Jerusalem , when one saw less in a day but remembered more . The tinkling of the pack-mule bells , the grumbling of the camels carrying water and fodder across desert stretches , the gay tents at evening after a long day in the saddle , the sometimes almost sumptuous dinners cooked by Arab chefs , and the very frugal meals when supplies gave out ? all now are a joy of the past that lingers only in the remembrance of those who were not born too late to realize by experience what Petra , a gem in a caravan setting , meant to past ages .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
