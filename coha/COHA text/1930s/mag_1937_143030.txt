Ranger off Coronado , Calif. , exchanged telegrams thrice with Rear Admiral Adolphus Andrews , chief of the Bureau of Navigation in Washington . Their substance : Might he resign ? No . Might he marry ? No . Might he have 30 days leave ? No . <P> Cadet Stagg 's desire to get off the Ranger was something easily comprehensible to the whole Pacific Fleet . He had just won the puzzler 's equivalent of first prize in the Irish-sweepstakes , had beaten 2,000,000 other hopefuls for the $100,000 first prize in Old Gold cigarette 's famed rebus puzzle contest ( TIME , May 24 ) .
