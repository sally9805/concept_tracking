The lure of sunshine has brought California wealth . It has also brought her thousands of families who possess poverty , an old car , and a genial disposition to bask and wait for someone to feed them . Well-stocked with indigents of her own , California has tried unsuccessfully to discourage unwanted guests with hostile police , stingy charitarians , hard-work camps , even jail or embargoes at the State line . <P> Last week Franklin Roosevelt and the California Senate in Sacramento proposed separate attacks on the problem . The President , studying a report by WPA Administrator Francis Harrington and other U. S. officials , concluded that migration is a national problem now that 300,000 to 400,000 indigents wander the motorways . In the time of living men , said he , such free souls may well be required to take root at a home address ( presumably in jail , if they decline to settle elsewhere ) . He indorsed U. S. legislation and emergency aid which would consist principally of finding jobs for migrants already in California and warning others to stay away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly Assembly a bill authorizing a California Agricultural Exchange , with aid from U. S. credit agencies ( RFC , FHA , REA , etc. ) to establish " balanced communities " for California reliefers . The Exchange would function as a cooperative , growing crops on common land , processing it in communal factories , selling the produce to its members and in the market . The State 's investment would be around $300 for every reliefer shifted from public rolls to cooperative balance . <P> Originator of the idea was slim , vigorous septuagenarian Vernon Campbell , long associated with California coops . Legislature approved a similar bill two years ago , but ex-Governor Frank F. Merriam killed it with a pocket veto . Busy Mr. Campbell has already organized his Exchange , with a board of directors including top flight Los Angeles bigwigs . Los Angeles Times Editor Ralph Trueblood offered to help , was told to lay low lest he scare off California Democrats . Liberal Publisher Manchester Boddy also was asked to keep quiet , lest he frighten Republicans . <P> These tactics worked admirably . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all but seven Senate Republicans voted for it . So did all but two Democrats , after talking it over with Governor Culbert Olson . Happy Mr. Campbell counted on favorable action by the Assembly , Governor Olson and the U. S. lenders without whom the plan can not work . If all cooperate , Cooperator Campbell 's first community for balanced farmers , carpenters , barbers , etc. will rise at Bellflower , about 20 miles south of Los Angeles .
