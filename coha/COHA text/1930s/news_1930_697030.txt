txt When the delegates of all the nations-at the naval conference meet : in executive session on Tuesday : the , United States probably will be able to present in a general ; way the minimum American naval requirements as the first step toward ' eventual limitation or reduction ; ? . . . The - American naval advisers were 1* session ; most of yesterday and infothilly , , groups today . They will reSiM*1diseuxsions tomorrow morning , and therie  --  distruatiiiitimism that on Tuesday the United States for the first time since the convening of the conference will be able to place at least some cards face up on the table . This means that America may be able , to give the approximate total tonnage in all categories which , in the view of the United States delegates and naval officers , is the minimum necessary for national defense . It is also - possible that they may Alve detailed figures in certain smaller classes ; for . instance , destroyers and submarines . Whether this will be true of cruisers is impossible to answer tonight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegation with Admirals Pratt , Jones , Moffett , Pringle , Hepburn and Yarnell and other naval officers attached In technical capacities to the delegation . In the matter of battleships , which is continuing , in the view of the Americans , to be the most important phase of the conference , there is some doubt whether the United States is ready to announce concessions involving reduction in ' thenum  --  ber ? ' of - such units ; displacement or guns . on Tuesday . . The same applies to airplane carriers . American Recession Forecast . Information from high sources leads to onlr.one conclusion , ' and that is that in the end the United States , in the interest of complete harmony , will recede from the position of the 35,000-ton capital ship , which is the maximum under the Washington Treaty , and will agree to reduction to 30,000 or even 28,000 or 27,000 tons . Beyond the last named figure , . it is generally believed that the United States is not ready to go . Many of the most prominent officers in the American Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position that no cut should involve tonnage , arguing that the Washington treaty . total is necessary to , the efficiency of the fleet . Apparently there is no question but that the United .

This would necessitat ' scrapping three American and five Britisr battleships . At the ? same time there is much talk of a more drastic cut to twelve capital units for Great Britain and the United States . But if this is proposed it is certain to meet strong opposition in influential circles of both navies , more so apparently in. the American than in the British service . Concessions Expected .

It is not expected that America will offer a definite proposal , but one for ft basis of discussion and formulation of a plan involving such craft as will meet the needs of .
