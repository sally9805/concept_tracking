 | " MISS BROWN ? " The voice of the office boy at the information desk in the great banking , investment , and trust company was brisk and business-like . A slim girl in dark furs stood up . " All right , " nodded the lad . " Mr. Sears will see you now . Straight ahead down the hall . You 'll find his name on the door . " With her heart beating rather painfully at thought of the approaching ordeal , her first business interview in quest of a job in the financial world , Miss Mary Brown , college graduate , mustered her courage ? after all , he could n't do more than turn her down ! ? walked down the hall , and opened the door . A man at a big polished desk near a window , dictating to a stenographer , glanced up , said , " One moment , please ! " indicated a seat , and resumed his dictation . Grateful for the brief respite , Mary Brown sank into the chair . All her carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a complete blank . But something in the tone of the man 's calm , unhurried voice , something in the very atmosphere of the room , an impersonal quality of concentration , of work to be done , reassured her ; she forgot to be afraid . And when the stenographer slipped away and the executive turned and said in his deep , pleasant voice , " Well , what can I do for you ? " the impersonal atmosphere of the room still held her and she was able to tell him simply and concisely what she wanted . She had not come seeking a job , she explained ; at least , that was not her immediate object . She wished to know what were the opportunities for women in the financial field . Was there any chance for a woman who was willing to work hard , to climb up as a man climbs , to be promoted and to achieve a position of responsibility with adequate salary ? In short , she concluded , it was not a job she was seeking , but a career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face , and it was evident that he was interested . This particular interview took place shortly after the war , when banking , investment , the brokerage business , and all the intricate ramifications of finance were still held to be exclusively man 's domain . Save for a few stenographers , switchboard operators , and clerks , women were rarely seen in these big financial institutions . A man might work weeks without ever running into a woman employee in the elevators , offices , or halls . And there was the tradition of ages behind this iron-clad conservatism . Banking , investment , the handling of moneys , have always been considered purely masculine occupations , a kind of sacrosanct hierarchy in which all the high priests and even the young accolytes are men . So when Mary Brown , instead of slipping in quietly with the stenographers , switchboard operators , and file clerks , @#  | marched boldly into the vice-president 's educe and demanded what were the opportunities for a career , she was doing a bold , a revolutionary thing ? only she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed her so keenly . And he liked what he saw . He liked her immaculate freshness of appearance , her pleasant voice , her uiet , well-bred poise ; and above all , he lined her impersonal manner . This girl had brains like a man 's ! Why could n't they break her in to handle the women customers , the pest of a busy financier 's existence , always buzzing around like gnats , stinging when they did n't get their own way ? By Jove , that was an idea ! The women would n't try sex-appeal on that girl ! Competent , impersonal ? that was how he sized her up ; and an impersonal woman in business is worth her weight in gold . " Do you know anything about banking finance ? " he inquired . " No . But I 'll study . I 'll work hard . And I think I could learn . " " We give a banking course , " he said thoughtfully , " for our young men . A very thorough training ; it takes a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never had a woman ' .... " He pondered keenly . " How are you on typing and shorthand ? " She did not know stenography , she said ; and , secretly , she never intended to know it , but she was too tactful to tell him so . Stenography , as an occupation , ranked in her mind something like putting studs in men 's shirts , a kind of business valeting , highly necessary and maybe useful in opening a door to larger things , but she was afraid of getting into a blind alley . @# " Well , " said the executive after they had talked a while , " you come back tomorrow . I have an idea ? but I 'd like to think it over first . " " And so I came back , " said Mary Brown , telling me the tale of her early beginnings , " and I was interviewed by three other executives , and the upshot was that they decided to give me a year 's training in their bond school for men and pay me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman they had ever permitted to take the course . It was a great opportunity , for the school is one of the best in the country , practical , thorough , with excellent instructors ; and during that year I really got hold of the fundamentals of banking and investment , and learned about railroads , public utilities , the great industrial corporations , their histories and financial structures , and economic trends . After that training I had a year inside the organization , shifting from one position to another in order to learn the policy of the company , its ways of handling business and customers . Then I began to sell bonds . I was placed on exactly the same footing as the men ; there was absolutely no difference or discrimination made , either in salary or hi treatment . One rule held for all ; we  | had to make good , bring in new customers , produce , deliver the goods . " So Mary Brown became a cub saleswoman in one of the most powerful investment and banking organizations in the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about and persuading the public to buy her firm 's bonds . They were good bonds , and she knew all about them , and so she sold them to business men , to institutions , and to banks . Few of her clients were women simply because women were not so easy to get at . Nine customers out of ten were men , and these men began to have confidence in her financial judgment because she made money for them . They began to ring her up and to send other customers ? their wives , and their wives ' friends . Mary Brown began to have a vogue . " You go to Mary , " the men would say . " Mary 'll take care of you ; she 's better than a man , more conscientious ; if she says a security is good , you may rely on it ; and what 's more , she 'll tell you when to get out , and by jiminy , she 'll make you get out , too ! She 's not just trying to pile up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mary has the goods . " And this was true . Mary Brown was cautious , long-visioned ; when she acquired a customer , she kept him by putting him into sound investments and by leading him with a firm hand along a safe road . She was so conscientious that she almost bent over backward , and she protected her customers as a mother hen protects her brood . Among her clients were millionaires , delicatessen proprietors , trusteed estates , professional women , lawyers and doctors , business men , women of independent incomes . The men liked her because they could rely on her integrity and financial judgment ; they could hand over their earnings to Mary and absorb themselves in their business affairs , knowing she would not steer them upon a reef . The women liked her because she explained , taught them their financial abc 's , was infinitely patient with their ignorance , went into details . Men advisors tell women what to buy ; women advisors tell them what to buy and why ; they teach , educate , as they go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a cub saleswoman , climbed slowly but surely up the ladder of success . She became an advisor , remaining in her own office . She had so many accounts that she could no longer afford to seek her customers ; they sought her ; that is what inevitably happens in the cycle of success . And so , scorning delights to live laborious days , working long hours and studying late at night to keep abreast of economic trends , Mary Brown in less than ten years achieved a position of power and deep responsibility . She has won prestige and reputation , and her salary is exceedingly comfortable . Her opinions , therefore , on the opportunities for women in the financial field and the qualifications necessary for success are valuable , based on actual experience extending over a period of years . " There is no doubt , " she said , " that the financial field offers great opportunities for women and every year these opportunities are increasing by leaps and bounds . Where banks and investment houses employed one woman ten years ago , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single ramification of finance in which they have not found a foothold . They have overcome great obstacles and shown extraordinary ability in mastering intricate financial problems . And best of all , their forward march has been a peaceful penetration ; women have not had to fight for their rights ; the men themselves have granted them opportunities and helped them every step of the way . " Now let us consider some of the qualifica- tions a woman must possess in order to succeed in this field . And since I am a saleswoman , I am going to confine my remarks to that phase , since it is along that line that my entire experience lies . 1 might add that at present this is the most profitable field for women , and the financial rewards are comparatively high . In a normal year , a woman who sells securities for her firm may make anywhere from $5,000 to $25,000 annually . In periods of depression she makes less . So let me limit my discussion to this phase of the subject and let me frame the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to succeed in selling securities for her company , in acquiring new accounts , and in achieving a responsible advisory position looking after her customer 's investments ? " First of all , she must have financial training , a solid foundation of education on the economic history of this country and the general business of banking . Without such specialized knowledge she can not travel far . She must know about railroads , public utilities , the great industrial corporations , government issues , economic trends ? the whole financial structure underlying business . Some of these courses she may get in college , and she should take these courses if her inclinations turn toward a career in finance . If she is not college bred , she may be able to take university or extension courses dealing with these subjects . There are excellent economic and banking courses given at night by some universities and in summer schools . Or she may attend a bond school . These schools are maintained by certain of the larger security houses in order to train their most promising employes in salesmanship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books , articles , and the financial columns of the big dailies . But this selfeducation is slow and hard . Somehow or other , though she must acquire that solid foundation of financial knowledge before she can sell securities , advise investors on what to buy , and be able to handle their accounts . Second , in order to achieve success selling securities , a woman must have excellent health , a strong constitution , and the ability to endure fatigue . Her work s strenuous . She must be out in all kinds of weather , meeting all kinds of people , persuading , convincing , using up her vital energy , on her tiptoes all the time competing with the men . In fact , she has to do even better work than the men , show superior salesmanship , in order to maintain her , ground . Is this unfair ? No , because in this field women are still the newcomers , the pioneers , and they must be prepared to show reasons ? good , solid , financial reasons ? why they should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they must not only keep pace with the salesmen in their department , but excel them , stand out conspicuously . And this extra effort which a saleswoman must put forth demands , above all , fine physical vitality , endurance , and driving power . " We come now to that elusive quality called personality . A woman who goes out to sell securities is the representative of her firm , and investment and banking houses are apt to be even more conservative , traditionary , and opposed to new customs than other business concerns , so that a woman who represents them , must , first of all , command respect ; she must have good breeding , poise , tact , sincere and convincing manners . Women under twentyfive years of age are too young to sell securities ; their judgment is apt to be immature , their financial education inadequate . They should take some minor position in the firm in order to learn the background and details of their job . College girls who have had a specialized training in finance are excellent timber for saleswomen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to have more judgment and tact than youngsters . Women beginning at forty and forty-five have often made good in this field . " I should like to mention another qualification , which , after training and health , plays a more important part in success than most people realize . That is what I might call a good business disposition . What do I mean by that ? I mean the ability to work harmoniously with associates and superiors , to take orders , and to make the best of petty irritations , slights , and injustices . " A woman must not be arrogant , aggressive , or cock-sure in her manners , even though she is making a conspicuous success of her work . Men are not plaster saints , and if a woman goes about with a chip on her shoulder , she is pretty apt to find some man more than ready to knock it off . Antagonism does not pay . A woman may be brilliant on her job , she may privately consider that she knows a lot more than her boss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat . I stress this point because it is the reef upon which many clever women founder in the financial world . They ca n't take orders . A little success in selling , and they want to be generals right away . " I remember one woman in particular whose haughty belief in her own superiority caused her downfall . As a saleswoman , she was a wizard ; she had a decided flair for it , and she knew her job ; she worked day and night , studied , and was charming with her customers ; she could sell anybody ; her sales were continuously higher than those of the men in the same department . But she gloated ; she was sitting on top of the world , and she let everybody in the office know it . Presently she asked for a raise . The main office was keen for her ; they did n't have to work with her ; they saw only her record sales . But she fell into a dispute with her superior , a man , and she told him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his business also ? better than he did . He fired her on the spot . She refused to be fired and took up the matter with the main office where she believed she was ace-high . To her utter consternation the downtown executives supported her boss ; she remained fired . She stamped out of that office in a towering rage , declaring all men were unjust tyrants . But the fault lay in herself . She could n't get along with her associates ; she could n't take orders , submerge her own ego ; she had to be first . " That leads me directly to another point . Women who wish to achieve success in selling securities must not intrude their sex into their  | business relationships . Remember , they are representing their firm to strangers ; and coyness , sex-appeal , flirtatious manners , and coquetry are absolutely taboo . It is highly necessary in order to succeed at selling securities to possess personality , but do not confuse personality with sex-appeal . The personality which wins success in this field is based on character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impersonal manners , thorough knowledge of your subject , and a compelling magnetism which makes your customer realize that you are not begging a favor but offering him an opportunity . That is salesmanship , and sex has nothing to do with it . " One day I asked Mr. Sears why he decided to send me to the men 's bond school . Why had he made an exception in my favor ? " He replied , I was impressed by your impersonal outlook . ' " Most women , he added , are too personal in their business relationships ; they are prone to be influenced by their personal prejudices , to get mixed up in office politics , and to raise a rumpus if somebody is placed over them who does not conform to their social standards . I know a woman who resigned from a good position because , as she said , one of her business associates , was not a lady . ' " But if a woman intends to make a success of selling securities , she must keep her social prejudices for home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the social register ; she must learn , like men , to meet everybody on a democratic basis . Her customers may be domestic servants , Italian fruit vendors , Polish factory workers , chauffeurs , or millionaires ? and the chauffeur may be the very one who wins for her the millionaire 's account ; or the servant , by a chance casual remark , may cause her mistress to ring up the saleswoman and place a substantial order . I have had that happen to me . First I took care of a butler 's investments , and presently his mistress came to me on the butler 's recommendation ! So a woman must be impersonally courteous and considerate to all . " I should like to say a word about stenography . A knowledge of shorthand and typing may be very useful in other branches of finance , but it is not necessary in a salesmanship career . In fact , it may hinder promotion . If a woman is an excellent private secretary , her employer may not wish to give her up , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't learn stenography ; if you do know it , keep it dark . If you have no financial background , ally yourself with some firm that gives a bond course ; or take some minor position in the office and study outside . But go after what you want . Remember , you ca n't wait for luck to break your way , or for an angel to provide you with exactly the right opportunity . Know what you want and then go after it . Do n't hold out for high wages . For the first year , the firm will probably carry you at a loss on their books . They can do without you far better than you can do without them . So do n't haggle over remuneration . In the beginning , the salary is less important than your goal . " AND now let us glance at the experience of another woman who has achieved substantial success in the financial world , also in the selling field . An older woman this time , sheltered , with no business experience , no college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in the old-fashioned sense of the word , well-bred , with an attractive personality and a persuasive smile . She decided to go into business . At a friend 's suggestion she interviewed an executive in a bond house and signed up for a three months ' course given by the firm to train salesmen . One day her boss said to the class : " Here , you cubs , go out and sell these New Jersey Standard Oil bonds . You do n't have to know anything ; these bonds are so giltedged they 'll sell themselves . Now shake a leg . See what you can do . " She put on her hat with trepidation , went out and made a killing the first day . The bonds went like hot cakes . And she did n't go to friends ; she interviewed strangers . It gave her a great thrill . She said it made her feel like Rockefeller . She found selling as easy as falling off a log . Of course she had a flair that way . And she studied hard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I first began , " she said , " there were only a few women selling bonds . My firm was considered very progressive , radical even , to take on women at all . Other firms watched us , dubious . Women , they declared , did n't belong in finance ; they were out of place ; men would refuse to deal with them , and women 's accounts did n't pay . Women were the devil to deal with , anyhow . Keep ' em out ! So at first our employers had to be very cautious . They made rules , restrictions . We must not go to men 's offices , they said , and solicit customers ; the public would n't like that . Besides , it was n't dignified . ' We must remain invisible and write polite little letters . But bless you , that did n't last long ! One good personal contact is worth a whole wastebasket full of polite epistles . Now , as everybody knows , men are women 's best clients . A saleswoman can often get into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salesman ca n't get past the information desk . So the business men were our friends from the start . Also , we were instructed not to try to sell to banks . Those august and sacrosanct institutions certainly would turn us down ! Their conservative executives would consider it infra dig . to deal with women . But they did n't . During my first six months I succeeded in getting a bank as a customer . You know the old saying , Forbid a woman to do a thing , and that 's the thing she 's determined to do . ' Well , I was determined to get a bank . It was a conservative bank ; our firm had coveted its business for some time . And it was a field day for me when I brought in its account . They told us , likewise , not to go after big corporations or millionaires ' accounts . But they did n't refuse them when we brought them in ! For a woman to handle a millionaire 's account or a large trusteed estate is not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when investment houses began to employ women to sell securities , was that the newcomers should handle women 's investments . These feminine accounts have always been considered nuisances . Women customers wo n't stay put ; they take up time , ask millions of questions , and then refuse to abide by man-made rules and go off on tangents of their own . Or they throw scenes , go into hysterics , use sex-appeal . In fact , they drive men crazy ? or men say they do ! So the investment bankers had the bright idea that women should handle these pests , and at the same time tap a practically unexplored field . " That was the original idea . But ixt practice it did n't quite work out as the bankers intended . For women customers were hard to find , while the men customers were thick as blueberries in summertime . Moreover , business men discovered that they liked to deal with women ; they found the newcomers competent , conscientious , conservative ? more conservative than the salesmen . A woman , they discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leave them free for their business affairs ; she was a kind of financial housekeeper , so to speak . For women , as housekeepers , are used to handling money ; they are thrifty , cautious ; they know how to make a little go a long way . And as financial housekeepers to busy men they were a decided success . " To a woman who is desirous of entering the financial field to sell securities I would say three things : Know your job . Believe in your job . Give yourself to your job . These are the basic principles of success . " So much for the selling game which attracts the largest number of recruits on account of the financial rewards . And now let us turn to banking . What opportunities here are open to women ? The speaker on this phase of the subject is a woman who has achieved an outstanding success , beginning without financial education . " I was already past my first youth , " she said , " when I decided to go into banking . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Have you ever heard of that animal ? It 's a terrible monster ! There were months when it looked as if that monster were going to devour me alive . I did n't know a thing about figures , and it was a long nightmare trying to learn . Working beside me was a mere infant , a lad in his teens , and he knew all about the general ledger ; he could make it jump through hoops and feed out of his hand . For weeks I hated to open the glass door of the cage where that dragon of a general ledger and his young keeper were housed . This may sound funny ? but it was n't funny to me ! I used to rage at my ignorance . I raged because that mere lad knew so much more than I , a mature woman of twice his age , did ; and it was sheer shame and obstinacy that made me go on . " At length I conquered the general ledger , and then they gave me another wild animal to subdue which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cage . After that they shifted me to another position in the organization ; they kept on shifting me . In banking you have to know the business from the ground up , learn all the routine . Women who are going into banking must begin at the bottom . There are fewer openings for them than for men , so they must take what they can get . For example , you ca n't start out college girls as messengers , as they do with boys . Secretarial work , typing , and shorthand offer excellent opportunities for learning the inside of the business . Often college girls come to me and say , " I 'm offered a position as stenographer in the bank , but I do n't want to be a stenographer all my life . ' " To my mind , that is just about as absurd as for a boy , starting as a messenger , to say , But I do n't want to be a messenger all my life . ' " If a girl has grit and determination , there 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be preparing herself for the next job higher up , studying on the outside . " In. banking thus far , women are still in the pioneer period ; they still have their spurs to win . In New York and in other large cities I do not know of a single senior executive position in a large organization which is occupied by a woman . Junior executive positions , yes . But they are not policy-makers yet . In the West and Middle West , in smaller organizations , women have done very well in banking . They usually start in as secretaries to the president or vice-president , learn the ways and policies of the bank and perhaps help out with the books . A KNOWLEDGE of accounting is extremely helpful in this field . A bright girl , armed with a knowledge of stenography and bookkeeping , may climb rapidly in a small organization ; she begins to substitute for the men when they are out at lunch or away on vacation ; presently she may become assistant cashier , and in time she may work up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some branch bank . This is more possible in smaller communities than in large cities where the machinery of the great organizations is more complicated and the competition intense . If a girl can take banking courses in college , so much the better ; and a college education always helps , although the girl must remember that she must start at the bottom and work up gradually , like a man .  | " In one branch of banking , opportunities for women have greatly increased in recent years ; that is in the management of trusts , estates , and the guardianship of children and adults who for some reason can not manage their own financial affairs . Here a woman 's touch , her sympathy , tact , and insight are genuine business assets . Take , for example , a guardianship trust for a boy , a minor . He comes home from school . He has to be met at the train , his lodgings arranged , his clothes bought , his entertainment provided for . It is the bank 's business to care for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimate services much better than a man . In one instance which I know , a woman is so competent and successful in this position that she is called the Trust Mother . " But is this banking ? ' some one asks . Of course , it is : Some official in the trust company has to attend to these details . " Today a modern bank with its numerous services resembles a great department store , and opportunities for women are constantly increasing . For example , there are the women 's departments , administration and personnel work , research and statistical branches , private secretary-ships to senior executives , assistant cashiers , and managers in branch banks . Already in this field women have their feet very firmly planted on the lower rungs of the ladder , and it depends upon themselves how high they will climb . " IN THE brokerage firms , the great stock exchange houses where securities are bought and sold , opposition against women has been more heavily concentrated than in other financial fields . The more conservative of these firms still refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reactionary wing , and its leaders are powerful . In extenuation of their position they say that they do n't want women messing around ; they ca n't do anything that a man ca n't do better . Private secretaries , switchboard operators , filing clerks , yes ; but there they draw the line . There is , however , a more liberal wing , composed largely of younger men who have risen to power since the war . These modern executives believe that women have brains and can learn the intricacies of the brokerage business just as well as men . They were the first to accept women as customers and to employ them in responsible positions . The experience of one of these women brokers shows what can be done in this field . Mr. Jones , as we will call him , senior partner in a brokerage house . was among the first to seek women 's investment business . He decided to try the experiment of having a room exclusively for his women customers . He looked about for somebody to place in charge of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you know about securities ? " he asked . " Nothing , " she replied frankly . " But give me a chance , and I 'll learn . " " All right , " he said . " Go into that room and see what you can do . " She went , and she took to the brokerage business as a duck takes to water . At first she asked millions of questions , and the men helped her ; they showed her where to find information , sources . She learned to read the tape and to get the feel of the market . Men as well as women began to seek her out . Presently she was made assistant manager , then manager of a branch office . It meant years of constant study . reading far into the night ; it meant sitting down with her women customers , explaining , instructing , advising . She was more like.a teacher than a broker . Her reputation began to go abroad . Other firms began to employ customers ' women . Now it is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as customers ' men . And possibly a bit more conservative and conscientious . It hurts them to have their customers lose money . The thrifty , housekeeping instinct again ! College girls are going into uptown brokerage houses and learning to do everything . Why not ? The brokerage business is no harder to learn than Greek or higher mathematics . But it is not necessary to be a college graduate . One woman who achieved a notable success started in as a stenographer . " I can honestly state , " she said , " that I can do just about everything in a brokerage office . I learned all about my own job and the job ahead of me , and when the big boss went off on vacation or business trips I was left in charge . In that fashion I began to learn the larger aspects of the business . " Some years later she was given a position with a firm just to see what she could do . In time she became manager of the trading department in charge of buying bonds in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch offices scattered throughout the country . A fairly responsible position for a young woman ! Once , when the head of the firm was away , she bought $4,000,000 worth of bonds on her own authority . Her judgment proved sound , and the firm realized a handsome profit . Her salary at that time was $10,000 a year . At this point she left the firm and went into business for herself . " Women workers in finance , " she said , " must have not only good health , but good dispositions . If they expect to succeed in a large way they must learn to see things simple and big , and not get lost in a mass of detail . Women have imagination ; but they do n't use it in business as men do . They must learn to catch opportunity on the wing , and if it does n't appear , they must go gunning for it . Do n't sit down and wait for the apple of success to fall into your lap . " IT IS interesting to get the masculine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , and with this in mind I interviewed the senior executive of a large Stock Exchange house with branch offices in many cities . He gave his unqualified approval of the movement . " There is a great field for women in the brokerage business , " he said . " In fact , as far as opportunities are concerned in this field , the surface of the ground has scarcely been scratched . The next ten years will witness a tremendous increase in the sale of securities , in expansion of brokerage firms throughout the country ; and in this expansion women will inevitably play their part . I see no reason why women should not be as good as men in the buying and selling and handling of securities . In fact , they are just as good . There is absolutely no difference between the two sexes in this respect . " But there are certain qualifications necessary for success . They are the qualifications of training , personality , and character which women as well as men must possess . As I see it , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among these fundamental qualifications is training , a knowledge of finance . I think the time is upon us when the women 's colleges must give more courses in economics and banking in order to fit a girl for a financial career . Take my own daughter , for example ; she 's deeply interested in the brokerage business ; she 's taking special courses in college , reading everything she can lay hands on , working as customers ' woman in summertime in one of our branch offices . That girl is as keen as mustard . Already she 's asking me questions that I ca n't answer . She 's going to learn the business from the ground up , and if she makes good , some day she 'll probably be a partner in the firm . " A second qualification is good breeding . The right approach counts for a great deal in this business . Included in that category I would mention a pleasant speaking voice . I wonder if women realize the importance of an agreeable , cultivated voice . It is the first thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must not be intruded.  | A woman who is always stressing her sex is a nuisance in a business office . Be courteous , considerate , but impersonal in manner . Men appreciate deeply the impersonal quality in a women worker . " Thus far women have achieved no senior executive positions in the brokerage business , but this is not to be expected in the brief period which has elapsed since they entered this field . Most of them are still privates , so to speak , in a newly formed army which has not yet been licked into shape . But plenty of bright young lieutenants are springing up from the ranks , and a fair sprinkling among them have become captains . No colonels as yet . No generals . But when I observe these young women in action on the firing line as customers ' women and managers of branch offices ; when I see my daughter spending her vacations in a brokerage office , learning her job like a man , I say to my friends : Give the girls time , gentlemen ! Give them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " AND now , in conclusion , let us sum up briefly the salient points of this general discussion , note the chief opportunities for women in the broad field of finance and also the fundamental qualifications necessary for success . First of all , a woman desiring a financial career has three choices open to her ; she may take a job with an investment firm or a bank or a brokerage house . These are the three main types of institutions which transact the financial business of the country and in all of them women are welcome . In order to attain success , however , certain qualifications are necessary . The first of these is health , vitality , driving power the ability to endure fatigue in order to keep up with the pace set by men in what has been hitherto considered exclusively a masculine domain . The second requirement is a solid foundation of education in finance . A woman should know something about the economic development of this country ; she should understand the general principles of banking and the financial structure on which modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hope to climb far . But how is she to obtain this education ? By taking financial courses in college or university extension lectures on banking and economics ; by attending a bond school , or by self-education , reading , studying , etc . It is not necessary to be a college graduate , but a good , all-round education undoubtedly helps . The third requirement is that a woman , like a man , must begin at the bottom of the ladder , learn all about her job and gradually work up . In banking , a knowledge of stenography and book-keeping are valuable aids to rapid promotion . In salesmanship jobs , this knowledge is not so important , though stenography may gain you a foothold in the organization when everything else fails . The fourth requirement is personality . A woman must have integrity , good-breeding , tact , sincere and convincing manners which instinctively command respect . The fifth requirement is a good business disposition . A woman should not be aggressive in her attitude , but be able to work harmoniously with her associates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and overlook petty irritations . A good business disposition is worth its weight in gold . Sixth , women must not intrude sex into their business relationships . Women are apt to confuse personality in business with personality in sex . Personality in business is based on integrity of character , thorough knowledge of the subject , and a convincing earnestness of appeal ; it is an outstanding factor of success whereas the intrusion of sex is often the inner reason for a woman 's dismissal ; she is quietly sacked . Cultivate a courteous , impersonal attitude toward your fellow-workers and learn to meet everybody on a democratic basis . In short , know your job . Love your job . Feed yourself to your job with all that is in you . Do n't use your job merely to feed yourself .
