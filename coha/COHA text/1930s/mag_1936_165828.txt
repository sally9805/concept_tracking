Not a ruling Indian Prince , merely wealthy Sir Hukunchand Sarupchand purchased in 1919 a 45 h.p . British Daimler car with a gold-plated custom body which still suits him exactly : Last week , having been overhauled by the Daimler company which boasted that they had found it unnecessary to take down the sleeve-valve engine , Sir Sarupchand 's 17-year-old car emerged from a British plating works which has been doing over its gold surface . On removing the upholstery to renovate the stuffing , enough dead Indian red ants were discovered to make a heaping shovelful . Finally the car was packed for shipment to India with a repair bill of $7,500.
