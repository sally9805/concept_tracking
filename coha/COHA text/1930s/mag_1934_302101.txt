Six soft-eyed young rabbits , all dark grey , hopped nonchalantly about their pen in Harvard 's Laboratory of General Physiology last week as many a biologist discussed their twisted pedigree . They were living evidence of what two experimenters had reported as " the first certain demonstration that mammalian eggs can be fertilized in vitro . " <P> In vitro ( in glass ) is the polite name for methods by which physiologists impolitely try to fertilize ova removed from a female with sperm removed from a male . Such experiments have long been successful with forms of life lower than mammals . But attempts at external fertilization of rabbit eggs , though sometimes yielding the characteristic first signs of impregnation , never brought to birth any young . <P> Dr. Gregory Goodwin Pincus and his associate refined their operative procedure , gave their performers every advantage . The agouti* doe which was to contribute the ova was first allowed to mate with a sterile buck . After removal the ova , examined to make sure they were not fertilized , were placed in a culture flask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black buck . Finally they were implanted in the right Fallopian tube of a New Zealand Red doe which had been rendered pseudopregnant by a sterile mating . The dark grey color of the bunnies , born 33 days later , was proof they did not owe their existence to an accidental fertilization of their red foster-mother . <P> <P> *Agouti : bavins black hair with yellow tips .
