txt PRICES OF MILK . Consumer Sees Wide Spread Between His Table and the Farm . To the Editor of The New York Times : The letter from a dairy farmer in Little Falls , N. Y. , in THE TIMES of Sept. 29 ought to lead to an organized protest , which might well be country-wide , against profiteering in the sale of milk in our great cities , which is laying an unjust tax of many million dollars on the- consuming public . Here are the figures : The up-State farmer was paid 2.70 cents a quart for his milk in June and 3.50 cents a quart in August . Half a cent a quart to the railway delivers the milk in New York City at a total delivered cost of 3.20 cents in June and 4 cents in August . This milk delivered in bottles is sold to the consumer at 18 cents a quart , a gross profit of 14 cents , or nearly four times the price which the farmer receives . , Glass milk bottles are made by automatic machinery at very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sealing are also done by automatic machinery at trifling cost . One man with a truck will easily deliver 300 bottles of milk a day . However , the big milk company still charges this unconscionable 18 cents price even when it delivers milk in quantity . The bid last week for furnishing milk in half-pint containers to the public schools for the children 's lunches was 41/2 cents each . The city adds half a cent to-this , so that the man whose children are in the public schools has to pay 20 cents a quart for the milk his children drink at luncheon , for which milk the farmer receives 31 , E cents . Even this is not the whole story . Millions of families can no longer afford to buy milk or have to do with less . This has greatly cut down the market for the farmer 's milk production . So the big milk company pays the farmer 0.85 cent ' a quart for this surplus milk , takes off the cream , which it sells to the city dweller at 25 cents a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food , into the streams in such quantity as to cause serious pollution . Most business concerns in this year of depression think they are doing well if they can net a 10 per cent profit on their sales . CHARLES WHITING BAKER .
