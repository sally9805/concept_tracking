txt One of the reasons assigned by Senator JOHNSON of California for his refusal to support Mr. HOOVER is his own vehement desire to " give the government back to the people . " This is a phrase , or formula , now quite common . It is found in the appeals of the Socialist party and turns up frequently among the vague aspirations of impatient radicals , young or old . The plain implication is that the government is now in the hands of a monopoly or oligarchy . It is supposed to have got there by fraud or force , and to be kept there by deception or intimidation . The result has been , according to this theory , to render government oppressive , corrupt and altogether hateful . If such it is , would the people desire to have it given back to them ? The story is that a New England church once expelled a member of the meanest and most miserly type , who devoured widows ' houses , and returned him , as the resolution read , " to the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a meeting , representing " the world , " and refused to receive him . If American government is now the rotten thing pictured , the American people might decline it as a gift if it were offered to them . Senator JOHNSON holds , of course , that the people are not getting the kind of government they want . But how are they to express their true preference ? By organizing into political parties and by voting . As they can not all be of one mind , the majority must be allowed to prevail . That has been a traditional American political principle . Does HIRAM JOHNSON admit its validity ? One would say not who observes his present course . He has undoubtedly a large personal following in his own State , but there is no question that a very large majority of the Republican party in California , which is his party , will vote for the election of Mr. HOOVER and will wish to have the Senator also support the President . But that part of the government Senator JOHNSON has obviously not the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! What is his idea , and that of those who agree with him and adopt his shibboleth. with regard to the methods by which the people are to choose and control the government after it is given back to them ? They can not all be assembled in one agora or forum . It is impossible to gather them all into a single council of the wise men . They can not be brought together into a kind of gigantic and glorified New England town meeting to pass upon the affairs of the whole nation . In short , they must choose spokesmen , representatives . That they attempt to do already under our present system , which Senator JOHNSON qualifies as so disappointing and even repulsive . What evidence is there that they would do any better if the old political gang were swept away and the people called upon to select a new set of rulers ? They would still have to organize ; still need committees ; still be subject to skillful manipulation by active and scheming men hoping to make a living out of politics ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the voice of reason has to struggle hard to make itself heard above the cries of faction and of passion . The more it was sought radically to change the government by giving it back to the people , the more would it appear to be very much the same thing after it had been given back . The plain truth is that the government of 120,000,000 people must be a that now ; and if it does not work well , or does not suit the voters , they have the power to change it while the politicians wait . Indeed , one of the most extraordinary features of this Presidential campaign is the evident belief of the managers of both parties that great masses of people are going to take the bit in their teeth , this year , - and assert their power to remake both the ? personnel and the policies of the government . The puzzling question is not about handing it back to them ,  --  but what it will be after they hand it back to the nation .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
