A political champion may make a huge success in the provinces , but he is not worth his ice water until he has cried his cause in New York City . Abraham Lincoln made his first big national impression before an audience in Cooper Union in 1860 . William Jennings Bryan chose the rostrum of old Madison Square Garden to launch his first Presidential campaign in 1896 . Such job-seekers as Herbert Hoover , Alfred E. Smith and Franklin D. Roosevelt have counted New York the climax of their speaking tours . Similarly Rev. Charles E. Coughlin of Royal Oak , Mich. , after opening the membership drive for his National Union for Social Justice before an apathetic audience in Detroit , followed by a triumph in Cleveland , last week put himself to the critical test in Manhattan . <P> In Father Coughlin 's economics , the U. S. has plenty of everything except money , and since only $5,250,000,000 worth of currency is in daily circulation , he reasons that an additional two billion worth of greenbacks would be amply covered by the nine billion gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coughlin expound this theory , 18,000 New Yorkers packed into Madison Square Garden 's Auditorium . Just before the meeting the box office dropped the price of $2 seats to 50 , thus ruining speculators who had loaded up . Nevertheless , an overflow crowd of 5,000 was waiting before loudspeakers in the basement . <P> " If I come into the midst of this city , which , in the minds of most Americans , has consecrated itself to the worship of Wall Street , " announced the political priest , " I come not to criticize or berate individuals . I come to lift my voice on the doorsteps of a modern Temple of Mammon only to condemn a system of private money control . " <P> The audience may not have understood the nature of Father Coughlin 's National Union for Social Justice . But it did feel the emotional appeal of the sweating orator on the platform . At will the plump priest changed boos for the " prostituted press " to resounding cheers for assembled newshawks . In a phrase he switched catcalls at Senator Wagner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the friend of Labor ! " <P> Father Coughlin got some of his biggest applause when he shouted out against President Roosevelt 's new relief wage scale : " Think of it-a meagre $50 a month for administrative work ! . . . There is an American standard of living . My friends , if we are forced to see $19 or even $50 paid for such work in what we call a New Deal , then this plutocratic , capitalistic system must be constitutionally voted out of existence ! " <P> So saying , Father Coughlin departed mopping his brow , left town next day to spend the night with a friendly plutocratic , capitalistic stockbroker named Francis P. Keelon at swank suburban Larchmont.
