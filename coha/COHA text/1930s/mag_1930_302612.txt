Persons acute to the latest trends of modern art hurried to Manhattan 's Brummer Galleries last week to see the first U. S. showing of a precise , dapper gentleman unknown to U. S. shores , whose reputation in Europe is growing like a downhill snowball . <P> Pierre Roy is fiftyish , stocky , wears pince-nez and a very neat toothbrush mustache . Educated in England , he still buys his clothes there , is seldom seen without his bowler hat , yellow gloves and tightly rolled umbrella . M. Roy is completely bilingual and looks not unlike Premier Andr Tardieu . He has more over attained the nirvana of the French bourgeoisie , he is a rentier and need never paint a stroke , could live quite comfortably on his inherited income . <P> Pierre Roy has always been a painter , has given many a nourishing meal to the founders of Cubism . Though Derain , Picasso , Giorgio ( horses ) de Chirico are still his good friends , he has been influenced by none of them . Slowly , painstakingly , he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to finish a picture . The 42 canvases exhibited last week represent most of his life 's work-28 of them already belong to various collectors . <P> A wordy preface to the exhibition catalog by the French critic , Waldemar George , contains such gems of critical thought as " Art is made of double meanings . Pierre Roy . . . comes out of the infernal circle of twentieth century art and changes his centre of gravity . ... In the view of Pierre Roy the picture ... is not a picturesque visible fiction . It is a second phase of life . It is also a reincarnation . " M. George also describes M. Roy as a petit matre- a Little Master . By that M. George presumably means that Pierre Roy is not interested in the faces of prime ministers , prostitutes or the effects of the machine age , suitable subjects for Serious Artists . M. Roy is not . He is passionately interested in strips of colored paper , birds ' eggs , bits of string , seashells , ribbons , planks with holes bored in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would do credit to Ingres , David or the 19th Century miniaturists , but in high , exciting modern colors . <P> To these still lifes Artist Roy attaches sprightly titles : " The Quartermaster 's Farewell , " " Danger on the Staircase , " " Love Killed by the Customhouse , " " Offering of Asparagus . " <P> " The Birth of Venus " shows a curling lock of blonde hair tied with lavender ribbon , balanced against a branch of coral which in turn stands on a block of cork and a cockleshell . <P> " Honor to Unhappy Courage " represents a large oak plank on the seashore through which has been thrust a beautifully painted silver spigot . Several auger holes are cut through the plank , and draped over one corner is a graceful wreath of morning glories . <P> " Homage to a Hostess " represents an other oak plank ( with every grain minutely painted ) from which hang a red-feathered trolling spoon and a string of speckled birds ' eggs . Pinned to the plank is a sheet of blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am so sorry to leave unfinished this picture which I started two days ago for my kind hostess Mrs. Wadsworth . " <P> The Brummer Galleries , sure of the success of Pierre Roy , price his eleven unsold pictures from $1,000 to $2,500.
