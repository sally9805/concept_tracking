So complicated were the technicalities of the recent deals between Radio Corp . of America , General Motors Corp. , General Electric Co. , Westinghouse Electric &; Manufacturing Co. , that Radio 's accountants were momentarily baffled , had to ask the Stock Exchange for permission to delay their report ( TIME , June 16 ) . The essence of these deals was that General Electric Co. and Westinghouse , previously manufacturing 60% and 40% of RCA 's Radiolas on a cost plus 20% basis should turn over their patents and radio manufacturing plants to Radio , sell sets under their own names through their vast distribution systems ( TIME , April 28 ) . <P> Last week the fulfillment of these changes came when General Electric advertised that it had three models ready . Many pages of advertising , vast broadcasting programs , announced the new product of , as General Electric termed itself , " The House of Magic . " The advertising hinted of a policy which is known to be fundamental with the " House of Magic . " It puts its name upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic. * <P> While business conditions may make this venture seem untimely , the radio business is in a better position now than it has been for some time . Generally speaking , inventories are down , many old companies whose products became household words in a short time have been eliminated . Charles Freshman , Kolster , Brandes , Ware , Freed-Elsemann , Thompson , Bel-Canto , Sleeper , Themiodyne , are no longer names to be reckoned with . The industry has been concentrated into fewer , stronger hands , some of which are pioneer survivors . Old firms still strong include Atwater Kent , Philco , Grigsby-Grunow , Stromberg-Carlson , Crosley , Grebe , Andrea Inc. , Gulbransen Co . <P> Although many sets have been sold , the saturation point remains almost theoretical . From 1922 until the present , the number of homes with receiving sets has grown steadily . Radio and Its Future says that of 28,000,000 homes , 60,000 had radios eight years ago , more than 10,000,000 have them at present . This compares to 18,000,000 homes with passenger automobiles , 13,000,000 with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22,000,000 more can be sold before every home has a radio . Some homes will have two radios ; restaurants and hotels are markets ; automobile installations are a new , big factor . On figures such as these Standard Statistics bases its conclusions that 1931 can easily be a year of record sales . And television may some day render every set out of date , give the industry a new start . <P> <P> * When General Motors announced its Frigidaire , General Electric had already spent eight years of research on artificial refrigeration . Not until nine years later , in 1927 , did it enter the field .
