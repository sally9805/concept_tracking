A year ago the United Automobile Workers , their youthful ex-preacher president , Homer Martin , their strapping and scrappy organizer , Richard Frankensteen , were stars in the drama of renascent U. S. Labor and in the crown of John L. Lewis ' C.I.O. Since then nearly half of U.A.W. 's 400,000 members have been laid off and U.A.W. 's high command has been riven by a bitter political feud . If John L. Lewis could do nothing about the first difficulty , he could try to mend the second . So last week he welcomed both parties , which had split half- &-half; on U.A.W. 's 24-man executive board , to lay their troubles before him in Washington . <P> Heart of U.A.W. 's difficulties is the struggle between the Martin Progressive faction , which believes in strong centralized authority , and the Unity faction headed by Vice President Mortimer and Mr. Frankensteen , which believes in greater local autonomy . That , in Mr. Martin 's opinion , has led to U.A.W. 's " wildcat " strikes . Crux of last week 's row was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlanta and chairman of U.A.W. 's newly created finance committee . According to President Martin 's enemies , Mr. Pieper had pre-empted most of the executive authority at Detroit headquarters with no sanction except Mr. Martin 's personal blessing . According to President Martin , U.A.W. 's trouble was that Mr. Frankensteen , whom he demoted from assistant president to vice president two months ago , had been conspiring with U.A.W. " Communists " like Mr. Mortimer to get Mr. Martin 's job . <P> The rival delegations stayed at different hotels last week in Washington . But John Lewis insisted on seeing them together at his palatial new United Mine Workers headquarters . There he gave them a stiff six-hour talking to . Grim and tired , Leader Lewis emerged to announce that all parties would go to Capitol Hill next day to lobby for an important labor bill , an amendment to the Walsh-Healey Act making compliance with the Wagner Act a prerequisite for firms awarded Government contracts . After that , the factions were to reconvene at the Lewis headquarters . <P> When they met again , hotheaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his rights as U.A.W. 's elected president and cocking a rebellious snook at John L. Lewis himself , Mr. Martin summarily dismissed four of his vice presidents , including the Messrs . Frankensteen and Mortimer , and Secretary-Treasurer George Addes . He told six restive board members they would lay themselves " wide open to suspension " if they left the meeting . As one , the six walked out , leaving President Martin &; friends in command of a union now publicly split . <P> On John L. Lewis ' hands then lay the ticklish problem of whether to risk shaky U.A.W. 's equilibrium further by encouraging a convention that might either affirm or break Homer Martin 's authority , or blast U.A.W. permanently .
