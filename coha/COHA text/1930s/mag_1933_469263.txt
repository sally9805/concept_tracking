pERHAPS more than any other class , the country lawyers of the Corn Belt realize the present and the potential danger of the existing economic crisis as it affects the citizens of the farming areas of the Middle West and the country itself . A city banker sees it as a question of liquidity of assets , security of deposits , or desirable loans ; a professional economist views it as a maze of curves , most of them pointing downward , and a tempting opportunity to expound and perchance test his favorite theories ; but the country lawyer gazes into troubled faces across his littered desk and listens to the concrete facts of foreclosed farms and lost homes , of bankruptcies and distraints for rent . The banker and economist deal with figures and theories of recovery , but the country lawyer has to do with people suffering loss not only of surplus and profits , but of homes and lifetime savings which they have held as security against sickness , old age , and death . It has ceased to be a question of sending the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has become a struggle to pay taxes on the home and interest on the mortgage ; to avoid tax sales and foreclosures ; to keep a roof over the family , and to have the necessaries of life . Sixty-odd years ago , after graduating from the State University and being admitted to the bar , my father came with his young wife to the little county seat where I was born . Here he continued in the practice of law until his death ; and I now sit in the office where he sat for almost fifty years , gazing now and then , as he did , through the branches of the trees across the town square to the courthouse tower . We have never been corporation lawyers ; our clientele has come in the main from the sturdy agricultural citizenry of this formerly prosperous community . The fathers and grandfathers of present-day clients came to my father to have him prepare the deeds , examine the titles , and procure the loans when they settled here . The sons and grandsons of those pioneers now come to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk every day , and while I work over their problems , worries of the same sort regarding my own affairs are in the back of my mind . My people were pioneer stock who settled in Iowa in 1855 . My parents and grandparents were college bred and have contributed their share to the political and social life of the State . For eighty years the family has owned and operated farms in Iowa and , in the main , has gained its competency from the deep black soil of the Corn Belt . Therefore , my point of view is that of a professional man who , by inheritance , education , and experience is familiar with agricultural problems , and because of the investment of what is left of his own estate in farm lands , has a truly vital interest in this present crisis . My home county may well be considered a fair example of Iowa and the Corn Belt . It is one of the ninety-nine counties of Iowa and similar to those throughout the Middle West . Its condition and problems are typical of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its early citizenry was purely American pioneer stock which successfully withstood the attacks of Indians and the vicissitudes of border existence . To this nucleus have been added a considerable group of Irish immigrants who are centered in two or three southern townships , and a larger proportion of Scandinavians who constitute the majority in five or six northern townships . The manufacturing industries in our county seat have brought groups of laborers from the south of Europe , while Mexico likewise has furnished its full quota . Two railroads first came through this county in the late sixties , and other lines were built to tap its agricultural and manufacturing resources as late as the beginning of the present century . The wheat and corn of pioneer farming gave place in part to hogs , beef cattle , and dairy herds , and the development of sugar beets added to its prosperity . The county seat , with the establishment of large manufacturing industries , assumed an almost metropolitan air with comfortable homes and a contented people . Railroads radiating from the town made it the trading and jobbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ours . In the early days of the century Iowa , along with the rest of the Middle West , enjoyed a gradual , conservative increase in the values of farm products and farm real estate . Men who had homesteaded their farms from the government , paying $.50 or $3.00 per acre , saw the price of land gradually increase to around $100 per acre , and thereby built up comfortable fortunes . Early investors at $7 to $15 per acre profited by that same increase . Even though sales of farm lands were rare in those days , the new values seemed definitely established . This increase in values , though Henry George would have condemned it as " unearned increment , " did not come like the Biblical manna in the Wilderness ; it was the result of pioneer effort in the upbuilding and improvement of those farms and of the States in which the efforts were put forth . The boom period of the last years of the World War and the extreme inflationary period of 1919 and 1920 were like the Mississippi Bubble and the Tulip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Farm prices shot sky high almost over night . The town barber and the small-town merchant bought and sold options until every town square was a real estate exchange . Bankers and lawyers , doctors and ministers left their offices and clients and drove pell mell over the country to procure options and contracts upon this farm and that , paying a few hundred dollars down and expecting to sell the rights before the following March brought settlement day . Not to be in the game marked one as an old fogy , while paper profits were pyramided and Cadillac cars and pleasure trips to the cities took the place of Fords and Sunday afternoon picnics . Everyone then maintained that there was only a little land as fertile as the fields of Iowa , Illinois , and Minnesota , and everyone sought to get his part before it was all gone . Like gold , it was limited in extent and of great potential value . Prices skyrocketed from $100 to $e50 and $400 per acre without regard to the producing power of land . During this period insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making loans on Iowa farms at $90 or $100 or $150 per acre . Prices of products were soaring . Everyone was on the highroad , not only to comfort , but to wealth and luxury . Second , third , and fourth mortgages were considered just as good as government bonds . Money was easy , and every bank was ready and anxious to loan money to any Tom , Dick , or Harry on the possibility that he would make enough in these trades to repay the loans almost before the day was over . Every country bank and every county-seat town was a replica in miniature of a brisk day on the board of trade . Settlements were made on March 1 , 1920 , but , alas , from then on the painful awakening from this financial carousal brought long continuing headaches to the investors , the holders of second mortgages , and the bankers who had financed these endeavors . II The next decade was marked by a gradual decrease in the price of farm commodities , a shrinkage in farm values , and increasing attempts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during boom times . However , the foreclosure of a first or primary mortgage on Iowa real estate was as rare during this period as it had been in prior years . The basic value of Corn Belt land was still beyond question , and what few first-mortgage foreclosure actions were brought disturbed this confidence but little . During this same decade large drainage projects were inaugurated in the Corn Belt in order to bring large areas of " border " land under cultivation . Consolidated schools were erected to bring the highest type of educational facilities to the rural children . The proverbial little red schoolhouse became a modern brick building with enlarged faculties and increased facilities foreducation . Paved roads were built . All these features had been demanded and are desirable ; but the ability to pay for them has not continued . The general tax demands of school district , county , and State have equaled the interest on a thirty-dollarper-acre mortgage over the entire State of Iowa ; while special highway , drainage , and consolidated school assessments have increased the tax burden in areas affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , conservative mortgage lenders have hesitated to place loans on farms affected by these special levies , and in nearly every county the first of the flood of foreclosures was in such heavily taxed areas . The drastic deflation of Iowa loans under orders from the Federal Reserve Board , upon which Smith Wildman Brookhart , depression Senator from Iowa , poured forth his venom , definitely marked the downward turn in the mythical prosperity of boom days . Despite our hopes for the better , conditions have grown steadily worse . During the year after the great debacle of 1929 the flood of foreclosure actions did not reach any great peak , but in the years 1931 and 1932 the tidal wave was upon us . Insurance companies and large investors had not as yet realized ( and in some instances do not yet realize ) that , with the low price of farm commodities and the gradual exhaustion of savings and reserves , the formerly safe and sane investments in farm mortgages could not be worked out , taxes and interest could not be paid , and liquidation could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibilities of payment or refinancing , the large loan companies plunged ahead to make the Iowa farmer pay his loans in full or turn over the real estate to the mortgage holder . Deficiency judgments and the resultant receiverships were the clubs they used to make the honest but indigent farm owners yield immediate possession of the farms . Men who had sunk every dollar they possessed in the purchase , upkeep , and improvement of their home places were turned out with small amounts of personal property as their only assets . Landowners who had regarded farm land as the ultimate in safety , after using their outside resources in vain attempts to hold their lands , saw these assets go under the sheriff 's hammer on the courthouse steps . During the two-year period of 1931-3Q , in this formerly prosperous Iowa county , twelve and a half per cent of the farms went under the hammer , and almost twenty-five per cent of the mortgaged farm real estate was foreclosed . And the conditions in my home county have been substantially duplicated in every one of the ninety-nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We lawyers of the Corn Belt have had to develop a new type of practice , for in pre-war days foreclosure litigation amounted to but a small part of the general practice . In these years of the depression almost one-third of the cases filed have to do with this situation . Our courts are clogged with such matters . To one who for years has been a standpatter , both financially and politically , the gradual change to nearradicalism , both in himself and in those formerly conservative property owners for whom his firm has done business down the years , is almost incomprehensible , but none the less alarming . Friends and clients of years ' standing have lost inherited competencies which had been increased by their own conservative management . Not only their profits , but their principal has been wiped out . The conservative investments in real estate which we Middle Westerners have for yearsconsidered the best possible have become not only not an asset , but a liability , with the possibility of deficiency judgments , that bane of mortgage debtors , staring us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life been taken from us , but the necessaries are not secure . Men and women who have lived industrious , comfortable , and contented lives have faced bravely the loss of luxuries and comforts , but there is a decided change in their attitude toward the financial and economic powers that be when conditions take away their homes and imperil the continued existence of their families , The interests of insurance companies and outside corporations in Iowa real estate have resulted in a form of absentee ownership never before dreamed of . Large numbers of farms held by these outside interests are administered by men who do not have sympathetic appreciation of local conditions , and of the friendly relations which have been traditional between Corn Belt landlord and tenant . The sympathetic , friendly inspection of the crops , the fences , and the livestock , which formed the Sunday afternoon diversion of the small landlord , has ceased . Now some young lad , clad like an English squire in riding boots and breeches , with a brief case and a Ford , drives up , hastily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first payment of the cash rent has not been paid , tells the tenant that all checks for produce sold must be made out in the name of the company , and drives away . The personal element is gone . Gone , too , is that pride of ownership which made possible the development of stock and dairy farms with their herds of fat cattle and hogs , their Jersey cows , their well-kept groves and buildings which beautified and developed the countryside . The former owners were willing to use a large part of receipts from a farm 's income to increase its value and appearance , but the present absentee owner regards it only as a source of possible dividends . It used to be that a quarter section of farm land and a few shares of stock in the community bank marked a successful man ; now it is too apt to have placed him in the bankruptcy court , after an harassing experience of foreclosures and suits brought by the receiver of the little country bank to collect the double assessment on his stock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect only the land speculator but have no bearing on the individual farm owner who lived on and operated his farm . When conditions were favorable , when taxes were not too high and when there was no mortgage to meet , those men in the main have been able to meet the crisis by applying on the taxes and assessments the bulk of the earnings of the farm above their meager living . But this has been accomplished only by a sacrifice of upkeep of farm buildings and by loss of fertility in the farm itself . What we out in the Middle West term " hay wire " repairs have taken the place of necessary renewals of farm machinery . Live stock has been sold at ruinous prices . The future has been sacrificed to the exigent moment . From a lawyer 's point of view , one of the most serious effects of the economic crisis lies in the rapid and permanent disintegration of established estates throughout the Corn Belt . Families of moderate means as well as those of considerable fortunes who have been clients of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have lost their savings , their investments , and their homes ; while their business , which for many years hasbeen a continuous source of income , has become merely an additional responsibility as we strive to protect them from foreclosures , judicial receivership , deficiency judgments , and probably bankruptcy . Thank heaven , most country lawyers feel this responsibility to their old clients , and strive just as diligently to protect their clients ' rights under present conditions as they did in the golden days before the depression . Every time , however , when I am called to defend a foreclosure action filed against some client or friend , it is forced on my mind that an estate accumulated through years of effort has not merely changed hands but has vanished into thin air . As I sit here my mind turns to one after another of the prominent landowning families of this county who have lost their fortunes , not as a result of extravagance or carelessness , but because of conditions beyond their control , and which were not envisaged by the most farsighted . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iowa county from New York State , bringing with him what in those days was considered a comfortable fortune . His white hair , long beard , and patriarchal appearance resulted in his being termed Grandfather Burke ; and as the years passed and Johnson the Second assumed that same patriarchal appearance , the founder of the family became Great Grandfather Johnson Burke to all of us . His York State shrewdness enabled him to buy tax titles and purchase farms at advantageous prices until he and his family were the leading land owners in the county . As the years passed he left his square-built framehouse on the bank of the creek and spent his time in Long Beach , that second Capital of Iowa , in California . The second generation did not get along so amicably , and extensive and expensive litigation was brought to determine the rights of the active head of the second generation and his brothers and sisters . As a young lawyer , I sat in the courtroom and listened intently to the long list of farms owned by Great Grandfather Burke and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went into seven figures . Finally a settlement was made whereby Johnson the Second took over most of the Iowa real estate , paying off the other heirs in cash , mortgages being placed on the lands in order to make the settlements . In the long noonings we lawyers chatting in the courthouse commended the wisdom of young Johnson in the advantageous values at which he took in the farms . Years passed and Johnson the Second grew feeble with oncoming age and the worries of rent collection and interest payments , and the third generation furnished the head of the family . Values of mortgaged land kept going down . Interest , general taxes , and special assessments for drainage projects whereby more land might be brought under cultivation to produce a greater surplus took a larger and larger share of the once ample income from this estate . Tax sales and foreclosures , judgments , and receiverships have followed in rapid succession until now most of the fertile acres which this family once owned are handled by a trustee who is waging a losing battle to save something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did nothing which had not been considered good business by the preceding generations . Their management was sound , their loans were conservative . And yet their all is gone . This is but one of dozens of instances of more or less prominence in my home community . The old maxim of three generations between shirt sleeves and shirt sleeves is finding a new meaning out here in the Corn Belt , when the return to verylimited means in a formerly prosperous population is the result not of high living and spending , but of high taxes , high dollars , and radically reduced income from the sale of basic products . Take , if you please , what seems to me to have been a typical case of the tenant farmer , one Johannes Schmidt , a client of mine . Johannes was descended from farming stock in Germany , came to this country as a boy , became a citizen , went over seas in the 88th Division , and on his return married the daughter of a retired farmer . He rented one hundred and twenty acres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town banker . His live stock and equipment , purchased in the early twenties , were well bought , for his judgment was good , and the next eight years marked a gradual increase in his live stock and reductions in his bank indebtedness . During these years two youngsters came to the young couple and all seemed rosy . In the year 1931 a drought in this part of the Corn Belt practically eliminated his crops , while what little he did raise was insufficient to pay his rent , and he went into 1932 with increased indebtedness for feed , back taxes , and back rent . While the crops in 1932 were wonderful and justified the statement that the Middle West is the market basket of the world , prices were so low as not to pay the cost of seed and labor in production without regard to taxes and rent . Times were hard and the reverberations of October , 1929 , had definitely reached the Corn Belt . The countyseat bank which held Johannes ' paper was in hard shape . Much of its reserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which default of interest and principal had occurred . When the bottom dropped out of the bond market the banking departments and examiners insisted upon immediate collection of slow farm loans , as liquidity was the watchword of bank examiners in the years 1929 to 1932 . When Johannes sought to renew his bank loan , payment or else security on all his personal property was demanded without regard to the needs of wife and family . Prices of farm products had fallen to almost nothing , oats were ten cents a bushel , corn twelve cents per bushel , while hogs , the chief cash crop in the Corn Belt , were selling at less than two and one half cents a pound . In the fall of 1932 a wagon load of oats would not pay for a pair of shoes ; a truck load of hogs , which in other days would have paid all a tenant 's cash rent , did not then pay the interest on a thousand dollars . This man Schmidt had struggled and contrived as long as possible under the prodding of landlord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see me about bankruptcy . We talked it over and with regret reached the conclusion it was the only road for him to take . He did not have even enough cash on hand to pay the thirty-dollar filing fee which I had to send to the Federal Court but finally borrowed it from his brother-in-law . The time of hearing came , and he and his wife and children sat before the Referee in Bankruptcy , while the banker and the landlord struggled over priorities of liens and rights to crops and cattle . When the day was over this family went out from the office the owner of an old team of horses , a wagon , a couple of cows and five hogs , together with their few sticks of furniture and no place to go . George Warner , aged seventy-four , who had for years operated one hundred and sixty acres in the northeast corner of the county and in the early boom days had purchased an additional quarter section , is typical of hundreds in the Corn Belt . He had retired and with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few blocks from my home . Sober , industrious , pillars of the church and active in good works , he and his wife may well be considered typical retired farmers . Their three boys wanted to get started in business after they were graduated from high school , and George , to finance their endeavors , put a mortgage , reasonable in amount , on his two places . Last fall a son out of a job brought his family and came home to live with the old people . The tenants on the farms could not pay their rent , and George could not pay his interest and taxes . George 's land was sold at tax sale and a foreclosure action was brought against the farms by the insurance company which held the mortgage . I did the best I could for him in the settlement , but to escape a deficiency judgment he surrendered the places beginning on March 1st of this year , and a few days ago I saw a mortgage recorded on his home in town . As he told me of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his lips trembled , and he and I both thought of the years he had spent in building up that estate and making those acres bear fruit abundantly . Like another Job , he murmured " The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away " ; but I wondered if it was proper to place the responsibility for the breakdown of a faulty human economic system on the shoulders of the Lord . When my friend George passes over Jordan and I have to turn over to his wife the little that is left in accordance with the terms of his will drawn in more prosperous days , I presume I shall send his widow a receipted bill for services rendered during many years , and gaze again on the wreckage of a ruined estate . I have represented bankrupt farmers and holders of claims for rent , notes , and mortgages against such farmers in dozens of bankruptcy hearings and court actions , and the most discouraging , disheartening experiences of my legal life have occurred when men of middle age , with families , go out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wagon , and a little stock as all that is left from twenty-five years of work , to try once more ? not to build up an estate ? for that is usually impossible ? but to provide clothing and food and shelter for the wife and children . And the powers that be seem to demand that these not only accept this situation but shall like it . IV There is a growing feeling of bitterness in the Corn Belt . Many of us realize that economic pressure is forcing those who are forcing us but , nevertheless , a desire for retaliation has sprung into being in the past few years . Many men under economic pressure have come to feel that if nations and organizations of capital can disregard their obligations and their pledged word , the small fanner and business man should be granted similar privileges and similar immunities . The substantial citizens , in the language of the prize ring , at first " took it on the chin " and came back fighting ; but repeated knock-downs have made them sullen , discouraged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly contacts between town and country and even between individual farmers have lessened to a surprising degree . Where old clients when in town always came in to visit with me , now they seem loath to do so unless they have definite business and even then transact it as expeditiously as possible . They only ask if the depression is going to end soon and whether the price of hogs is likely to climb a bit . In these communities there was a temporary feeling of encouragementwhen their local banks resumed activity after the general bank holiday , but despite the slight increase in the prices of agricultural products , that optimism definitely waned in the next few weeks . The fact that no form of farm activity , feeding hogs and cattle , grain farming or dairying , has proved profitable for the past five years makes the farmers loath to undertake anything . Now it is a question of what will result in the smallest loss . This feeling of depression has particularly affected the younger farmers , who because of low prices of farm equipment and live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own advancement . They had little or no money and expected to get credit to start themselves in farming , relying in the main on " character loans " which for so long have been the great aid of the oncoming generations in the Corn Belt . The uncertainty as to chattel values in the minds of our bankers and the very attitude of the farmers themselves on the question of repayment of loans and taxes have reduced to the minimum the chance of the young man , raised and trained on the farm , to get a start . Discouragement and disgust with conditions is the inevitable result . And the country lawyer , along with the small-town merchant , suffers not only in the elimination of present business , but because valuable future clients are not able to gain a competency and build up new estates and businesses . After talking with dozens of the county officers , representatives of farm groups , and hundreds of farmers themselves from this section of Iowa , it seems to me to be the consensus of opinion that from ten to twenty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while as many more need only the urge of effective leadership and the power of mass psychology to be swung into the radical alignment . In the past few years the conservative leadership of the Farm Bureau as to farm problems in the Corn Belt has not satisfied a portion of its membership and its policies have been definitely opposed by non-member farmers . When it sought to speak for agricultural interests its voice was drowned in a wail of protest . New and more radical farm groups were organized . The Farm Union and its militant unofficial branch , the National Farm Holiday Association , speak for the newer radical group , as do the United Farmers of America . These three new farm groups in Iowa and the Corn Belt arc vociferous in their demands and only too ready to become exponents of direct action instead of working through political and economic channels . While their theories of relief are varied , they unite in opposition to the plans of political leaders and the ideas of the semi-governmental Farm Bureau . The membership of the Farm Bureau is shrinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence . The closing of hundreds of banks , with the resultant impoverishment of many families and the forced collection of many capital loans to farmers , has resulted in a feeling of hostility toward the financial interests . Men who in normal times regarded their contractual obligations as sacred have not hesitated to repudiate their obligations when possible . When constituted authority , such as the courts and the officers of the law , were invoked to enforce the orders of the court , resistance and violence resulted . In many sections of this and other States " penny sales " have been held at which a man 's neighbors , by threats and force , have often reduced normal farm sale proceeds by almost one hundred per cent ; milk and produce wars have been declared , during which allhighways into a city have been guarded by rebellious farmers seeking to prevent other farmers from delivering these vital commodities until prices satisfactory to them were assured ; and organized and successful attempts to force settlements by mortgage holders have resulted in a complete and definite abrogation of the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boone County occurred where live stock and machinery worth over three thousand dollars brought less than thirty at one of the first of the " penny sales . " The debtor 's neighbors and friends first warned and then with blows drove off prospective bidders at this sale , bid in horses at twenty-five cents apiece , milk cows at a dime , and fat hogs at a nickel , and the next . morning turned back their purchases to the former owner . Groups of farmers in many instances have intervened between mortgagor and mortgagee and between landlord and tenant to effect a settlement ; and if such settlement was not made , crowds of hundreds at the judicial sales have exercised the power of public opinion and the power of their fists to carry out what they deemed fair . These unfortunately are not isolated instances but seem to be a definite part of the program of some of the farm organizations . A year and a half ago mob resistance to a judicial sale first appeared in Iowa . The receiver of a small closed bank in Wright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of the bank 's debtors . Indignant neighbors and friends stopped the sale and with violence drove the receiver and the sheriff from the farm . Attorneys , judges , and county officers have been visited by groups of hundreds of enraged citizens from the cities , towns , and farms of Iowa , declaring that foreclosure actions and tax sales must not be held and that salaries of officials , expenses , and taxes must be drastically curtailed . Mortgage foreclosure sales have been stopped , attorneys , officers , and representatives of the loan companies assaulted , and even the court itself coerced . In Plymouth County , in April , an organized group of hundreds of farmers defended one of their neighbors from rightful eviction in accordance with orders of court . Their resistance continued for a number of days . The sheriff and officers of the State Department of Justice were driven off the place ; and the attorney , a college friend of mine who represented the owner of the property , was threatened with serious violence if he and his clients did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own property . When a lawyer friend of mine told me that an angry group of rural citizens from a nearby county had visited his office to demand the dismissal of a foreclosure action then pending , I suggested that be had better mail his instructions to the county sheriff and remain away from the scene lest in the morning paper there might appear a picture of the courthouse steps with an " X " marking the scene of the fatality . He went over to attend the sale in person and came back unharmed ; but none of us knows when these threats may change to action . The dead lion has his glories but the live dog has his comforts . I sincerely believe that , like my Scotch forefathers in Covenanter days , I could meet death for principle , but I am free to confess that when a few days ago a client of mine asked me to collect rent from a recalcitrant tenant I was mighty glad to effect a reasonably fair settlement for that client without having to face a milling mob of the angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial courts have been threatened and at last in an outburst ofviolence unprecedented in the Middle West a courtroom has been invaded by an organized mob and , because he refused to prostitute his office and violate his oath , a judge in one of the formerly prosperous counties of Iowa has been dragged from the bench , abducted , beaten , subjected to the gravest personal indignities , and hanged by the neck until he fainted from exhaustion . As I write , martial law has been declared in two Iowa counties by the Governor of Iowa , troops of the State have been sent to meet this heretofore unheard of condition , and military courts have been substituted for civil tribunals . These things have happened in Iowa and the States of the Middle West , not in Latin America . Class-consciousness coupled with mob madness has definitely appeared in the Corn Belt . In the main , as yet , when the particular situation has been carefully and truthfully explained to them and conscientious efforts have been made to right existing wrongs , these farmers have ceased to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly Iowans , aroused for the time being over political and economic conditions which neither they nor the mightiest minds of the leaders of mankind seem to understand . It is possible that with a decided rise in agricultural commodity prices and a return to more normal conditions in our agricultural regions , so that a man 's farm will produce enough , not only to pay the taxes and upkeep but to return a fair profit on the investment , the embattled farmers of Iowa and the Corn Belt may listen to present-day political soothsayers and economic propagandists for yet a little while . The farmer , thinking over his troubles as he follows his team down the long rows of corn , does not know what things are necessary to bring about a revival of farm-earning power . But unless definite and constructive plans are made by the powers that be , political , financial , and economic , and the necessary steps are taken to carry those plans to a solution which will assure the Corn Belt farmer of returns adequate to cover the needs of existence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V I have been told by a friend , whose sources of information are beyond question , that the military problems which were studied last year by the officers and men of the 34th Division , composed of National Guard units from Iowa , Minnesota , and the two Dakotas , involved riot duty to a large degree . In the fall of 1932 another friend , a veteran of service overseas and a reserve officer , told me that he , with a large number of other reserve officers , had been transferred from various specialized branches in the reserve to duty with the active National Guard Units of the 34th Division . What this portends I do not pretend to know ; but when a small group of intimate friends discussed this situation with the recently transferred officer , and he jestingly suggested that next summer he and his machine gun outfit might be patrolling the roads of Iowa or Minnesota or some other Corn Belt State , we wondered on which side the rest of us would stand . I thought of young Burke , three generations removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bred in Midwestern purple , educated in one of our great State Universities , and now turned adrift with little but tattered remnants of that fortune ; of Johannes Schmidt , the adopted citizen of this land , who had fought for it against his own race and kindred , and had left my office sullen and heartbroken , after his painfully acquired competency had been torn from his grasp ; of the younger son of George Warner who had returned to his old father 's house to find his father 's toil-won acres lost and the shadow of heavy debt on his father 's home ; and I multiplied these instances by the thousands and thousands of similar ones which exist in the ninetynine counties of Iowa and all the counties of Minnesota , Illinois , and the rest of the States of the Mississippi Valley which we proudly call the Corn Belt . And when I thought of these potential or actual radicals opposing the gay young lieutenant and his machine gunners , I did not dare to picture what might happen on some strip of rural pavement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot July sun beating down . Gentlemen , this is the Corn Belt !
