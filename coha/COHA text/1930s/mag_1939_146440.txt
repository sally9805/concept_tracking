When Walt Mason was 48 he had good reason to fear his fate . Small-town newsman with roving feet , he had drunk his way through many a sheet when he went to William Allen White , swore to work hard , not get tight . Pressing grindstone to his nose , he wrote a batch of rhyming prose . Walt Mason 's doggerel , couched in slang , hit the syndicates with a bang ; rich , respected , worth his salt grew reformed Booze-hoister Walt . <P> " Priest of horse-sense " to George Ade , he lived to see his fashion fade . But Walt achieved a modest pile before his stuff went out of style , retired to California 's sun to rest until his time was done . <P> To old Walt Mason , wise and meek , as to all men , came Death last week .
