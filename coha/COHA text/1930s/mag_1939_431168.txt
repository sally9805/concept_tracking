IN THE Marine Stadium at Long Beach , Calif. , where the world 's crack oarsmen and yacht skippers performed during the 1932 Olympic Games , fifty boys and girls shove their model yachts into the wind for the start of a race . On the Pacific Ocean , two miles off Long Beach . a score of the city 's older youngsters lie along the gunwales of twenty yachts . fighting for position as they approach a course marker . Through five classes of models and a dozen types of bay and ocean yachts , hundreds of school-age and older water enthusiasts become skilled yacht builders and sailors under a novel program developed by the city 's department of recreation . Two thousand young entrants will sail 1,500 model yachts this summer . Since the yacht-building program was started in 1930 , 3,000 models ranging in length from twelve to fifty inches have been launched . Scores of sinkproof flat-bottom boats for bay sailing and larger ocean-goers bear these model-trained enthusiasts over near-by waters . As director of this unusual , large-scale hobby . Frank M. Davenport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water . " If we never win a race , " he declared , " at least we will have taught thousands how to build something : how to swim , row , and sail : knocked a little pep out and pushed a little experience into them . " But Davenport 's model builders have won more than their share of races , including a national championship .  | Under Davenport 's supervision , Long Beach toys and girls begin to learn sailing and boats when they are only six or seven . " Practically every man and boy , sometime during : is life , has wished for a boat , " he explains , which is the reason the model-boat shop was stablished nine years ago . Before gouging into his first block of wood , each boy must pass a swimming test . Water safety is constantly stressed . Then he designs nd shapes the hull , cuts and sews sails , erects the mast and other rigging . At last , the model complete , he sits on the workshop floors and studies the sails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Later he sits on the edge of a dock and observes eddying currents swirling around hulls of various shapes and sizes . Ask any of these youngsters where he 'll nd dead spots in the sails under shifting winds , where pressures concentrate , where greatest slippage occurs , and likely he 'll pop cut with the right answer . He goes on , working with redwood or soft pine , to construct an eighteen-inch yacht , then a two-footer , thirty-incher , coming finally to the forty and  | fifty-inch models . The last mentioned , known as the Marblehead class , becomes a little complicated , yet the youngsters have turned out forty-eight of these trim sailing ships . Every two weeks , scores of model builders meet at the stadium to race their little ships . Each must be prepared to plunge into the water and swim out to his boat should she fall out of balance or take a wrong tack . Combination rowing and yachting sees then ' . following the craft in rowboats , adjusting the sails at each turn of a triangular course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some of the model builders observed their boats misbehaving in a spanking breeze . Around the workbench a group took up the problem , and shortly A. R. Lassel evolved a sliding rig designed to keep the yachts in balance under all wind conditions . no matter what course they might be sailing . Now each carries along the deck a spar which is held by a sliding chain plate , and the mast and other rigging in turn slide forward and backward , thus making it possible to balance a yacht in a few seconds . These youngsters are constantly springing surprises which bring them trophies for fast sailing . Ted Thorsen and thirteen others rode into Berkeley , Calif. , last year hoping to win the National " M " Class title with the 50-800  | yachts . Thorsen had equipped his boat with a spinnaker and a vane gear intended to keep the little boat headed constantly in the preletermined direction through the use of an airfoil connected with the rudder . Only Thorsen 's boat finished well the first lay , the others wandering around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested they rig the rest of the yachts similarly . " In one night ? " asked Thorsen . " Fast work , but we can finish the job before breakfast , " declared Teel . Fourteen yachtsmen turned to the job , and by sunup had completed thirteen spinnakers and thirteen vane gears . As a result , Thorsen won the championship , and other Long Beach models placed second , sixth , eighth , tenth , and twelfth . From models , many boys and girls move on to sailboats ; first to flat-bottom Skimmers within near-by Alamitos Bay , then to larger  | yachts capable of riding out fairly heavy seas . Skippering a Snipe , Rainbow , Skitmmer , Skimmerette , or Sunray becomes second nature , first learned with the self-sailing models . Davenport keeps his finger on the larger yachts , too . Nothing gives Davenport greater pleasure than reports that some of his former model builders have attained excellence in sailing on the high seas . Stewart Henshaw , who built models three years , now skippers a Skimmer . Fred Schenck sails his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found this boy , then aged ten , learning to swim in a city pool nine years ago . He invited Harry to try his hand at model building . The boy passed the Junior Red Cross life-saving tests , and Davenport handed him a small block of cedar . Harry proceeded to hew out the hull for a fine twelve-inch yacht . For two years the boy built small sailing vessels . then joined the Leeway sailing club for a little experience as a mate . He continued sailing , returning occasionally to construct scale models of boats he was sailing . Now he 's a professional swordfish hunter , plying hundreds of miles up and down the Pacific : " one of the best sailors off this coast , " according to Davenport . Occasionally the boys encounter trouble . Gale Beardsley and five youthful companions offered to bring in a boat sinking near the Long Beach breakwater recently . They set out in a motor-sailer , and as they approached the derelict in the teeth of a forty-mile breeze , the propeller became fouled on the towing line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to cut the wreck loose . Then his boat dropped its rudder . Unable to navigate , he saw the yacht drive against the rocks and begin pounding dangerously . Calmly , he ordered red flares lighted . Sometime later . Coast Guardsmen rescued the six shivering boys . " He knew what to do and he would n't let us get scared , " reported his crew on reaching safety . " Finest example of self-reliance I know about , " said Davenport proudly . And a direct result of years of experience building and sailing models .  |
