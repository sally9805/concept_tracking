he could spend the rest of his life in peace . He was going back because he had a legitimate claim against Handback and would not fly the country because he had collected it . He was going back because he would not leave Ponny in her condition . He thought of reason after reason for his return . When the train crossed the river and drew up at the depot , the necessity of doing something with the fortune became imperious . The valise in his hands must be put down somewhere . But everywhere he could think seemed an impossible hiding place . The moment a breath of his coup leaked out , Handback would overrun Florence with search warrants . He , Miltiades , would be landed in jail , and then the trial would begin . A hotel bus in front of the station garnered in a few travelers at twenty-five cents a head . The driver did not flag Miltiades . He was a home-town man , and home-town men knew the station was not as far away from the business section of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even see the bus . He wa 's remembering that during the Yankee invasion the Southern whites entrustedtheir valuables to their black slaves . No white man ever found what a negro hid ; the white psychology of finding never paralleled the black psychology of hiding . The thousandth twinge of anger and frustration went through Miltiades that the negroes were ever set free ; that the peculiar services which the black folk could render their white masters were lost . As Miltiades walked along the road with his valise he saw free negroes , as useless , s free horses , walking to and fro , and him with forty-eight thousand dollars to safeguard somehow . The irony of the situation bit at the Colonel 's nerves . The road from the depot led at first eastward to the Florence  --  Sheffield road , then northward into Market Street . Miltiades walked to the main thoroughfare , but instead of turning north he continued straight along a secondary roadP201that led to East Florence . He walked for some distance in complete concentration . After he had gone for perhaps a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between two gateposts but with no other sign of a fence . He called to whomever lived in the shack behind the gate . A negro woman began complaining : " Who is dat callin ' ? Hello , what you want ? " A coffee-colored woman came to the door and then gasped out : " Oh , is dat you , Coll Milt ! Scuse me , Coll Milt ! " " Where does Gracie live ? " asked the Colonel in a taut voice . " Rat on up dat way ! " Miss Tony pointed hurriedly . A number of small heads , kinky or curly , peered past the woman 's skirts . The dark woman shoved their faces backwardswith concealed violence . " You fool young ' uns , " she whispered furiously , " does you want to git killed ? " The Colonel suddenly had become the most terrible being a negro woman knows  --  a white outlaw.  | WHEN Colonel Vaiden reached Gracie 's cottage its whitenessand neatness touched the visitor with the ironic fact that his family 's former slave lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the panel ; then , without giving time for an answer , opened the door , entered the hallway , and knocked again peremptorily . His impulse was to storm into the cottage , jerk open closed doors , and shout , " Gracie ! Where the devil are you ! " But in reality he stood inside , reaching back and rapping on the shutter impatiently . An inner door opened , and Gracie came out . Her eyes were full of one kind of questioning which changed to another kind when she saw who it was . " Why , Colonel Milt ! " she gasped . " What 's happened ? " She saw the new leather case and knew this had something to do with her . A fear went through her mind that it containedpistols and ammunition ; that the Colonel was fleeing from officers and had come for her to hide him . " Gracie , I 've got this thing . " Ile swung the valise a bit . " I want you to take care of it for Inc . " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Till you come for it ? " She looked apprehensively at the bag . " Yes . . . . Here it is  --  where you going to hide it ? " " I . . . do n't know . . . up in the loft I suppose . . Nobody ever goes up in the loft . " " I want it kept safe , " said the Colonel , " it 's important . . . it 's money ! " " Law , Coll Milt ! " The cream-colored woman began to tremble .  | " Can you put it up in the loft ? . . . It 's heavy . " " I do n't know . . . . " Gracie came forward to take the bag , but she was so shaken she could hardly lift it . She knew perfectly well that the money belonged to Handback , that Miltiades had stolen it . " Oh , my Jesus , " thought the quadroon , " here he comes again , knocking me out of my place . " As she took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " This 'll get me into terrible trouble ! I know it 'll do it ! In the kitchen I 'll tell him I ca n't do it ! " She walked into the kitchen , trying to hold the bag away from her as if it were venomous . Every moment she planned to turn around and tell him she could n't hide his bag . The Colonel 's rush pushed them both hurriedly into the kitchen . There was a little square manhole through the ceiling , above the stove . Gracie seized her broom and began knocking it open with the handle . The Colonel watched her . " I do n't believe anybody will think to look up there , " he said , staring at the manhole . " I reckon not , " said Gracie , in despair at what she was doing . " If anybody asks you , tell ' em you do n't know anything about it . " " Mr. Milt ! " cried Gracie , " what do you want with so much for , anyway ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Put your broom handle through the crack and prize . . . that 's right . . . now get up on the stove and the table and put it through . " Gracie touched the heater . " The stove 's still hot . " " Lay a paper on it . . . . You wo n't stand there long . " Gracie did this , then lifted the bag from the floor to the table , and got up on the table and the stove . Miltiades helped push up the bag with the straw end of the broom , while Gracie strained to lift it in the manhole.  | The stove heated the sole of her shoe and began to burn her foot . She toppled the bag up into the ceiling . " Away from the stovepipe ! Away from it ! " prompted the Colonel sharply . Gracie worked at the bag so it would fall over the rafter away from the stovepipe . She jerked her foot off the stove and made shift to stand on the table . " Put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else on the stove , Col'l Milt , I ca n't put my foot on it any more . " " Here 's a stick of stove wood . " The cream-colored woman put her foot on the stick and then readjusted the cover , working it down tightly with the blade of a case knife . " Now , that 'll do , " said Miltiades , drawing a long breath and scrutinizing the ceiling . Gracie got down awkwardly , trying to keep her weight off of her burned foot . " Col ' . Milt , " she said , looking terrified at the ceiling , " wo n't that get you into lots of trouble ? " " I do n't know , " said Miltiades . " I suppose I 'll find out . " " Col'l Milt , whatever made you do it to begin with ? " she asked , overwhelmed by the magnitude of her former master 's swindle . " Do what ? " asked Miltiades , with a faint , sardonic sense of humor . Gracie could insinuate what she knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well . . . you having so much money , " replied the quadroon vaguely . She thought a moment and then asked , " What will I say you come here for , Col'l Milt ? " " If anybody saw me , they can guess what they want to . " Miltiades spent another minute in the kitchen , estimating the probability of fire from the pipe . Now that the manhole was closed it seemed as if the bag lay immediately against the stovepipe.  | " Now , Gracie , " he directed , " I am depending upon you to keep absolutely quiet about this . " " You know I 'm not going to say anything , " said Gracie gloomily . " I mean inadvertently  --  by accident , " impressed Miltiades . He walked slowly to the kitchen door , opened it , and let himself out the back way . Gracie watched him go with her heart beating heavily in her chest . She felt sick . Her foot , she believed , was blistered . She limped to a chair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom of her foot had become filmed and glazed from the heat , but it was not blistered . It stung , but it would amount to nothing . She made these observations while the body of her thought forecast unhappily what the future would bring and what had happened to her in the past through Miltiades . It was Miltiades , long ago , who had forced her child upon her and this child finally had broken off her concubinage with General Beekman . She had persisted in keeping Toussaint , so Beekman had sent her away from Montgomery back to Florence . Now she had found an even , unemotional haven in this cottage which Handback had given her , and Miltiades had caught her up again and was using her under compulsion . She had tried not to let him use her , long ago , in the stable loft , but she had been his slave . Today , in her cottage , she had become his servant again . She could not prevent him . His entrance and exit had been as brusque and matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , when she was a slave girl in her white father 's family . She put some vinegar and soda on her foot , and the pain went away.  |p206WTH  Miltiades the thought of Gracie lingered a bare moment after he stepped out of her door . She lived in a better house than he did : that was ludicrous . The heart of his thought was his money . Was it safe ? Suppose some unforeseenthing happened to him ; suppose he did not get back for his money for a term of years , how safe was Gracie 's stewardship ? The phrase , " a term of years , " banished the quadroon woman completely from the Colonel 's mind . He walked along the road from East Florence to Old Florence with a premonitionof a dolorous journey that might be ahead of him . He imagined himself walking like this in a shameful garb at shameful toil . Very well , suppose he .. allowed that he might be imprisoned . . . that he would be imprisoned . Would that change anything in him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a penal sentence ? Fortune , luck , could not minify the deep reality of himself . The Colonel admitted the possibility of being sent to the coal mines . He began dividing forty-eight thousand dollars by three , four , five , six . If they sentenced him for five years , he would be drawing nine thousand dollars a year during his imprisonment . He had never earned that much in his life . But this wage depended upon Gracie . If she should appropriatethe money while he was under restraint . . . he put the idea out of his mind by saying aloud , " She 's a Vaiden . " He did not mean by this that she was of the actual white Vaiden blood . He did not know that this was true . He meant that she was a unit of the old Vaiden menage ; that through the past the Vaiden blacks had always helped the Vaiden whites . They had helped them wring a living from theP207reluctant hills ; they had helped them resist the assaults and imprisonments and thieveries of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reestablish the Vaiden fortune , he felt sure that Gracie Vaiden would remain loyal to him . She was a Vaiden . A band playing in the distance brought the Colonel out of his planning . He was entering Old Florence . The drums and brasses of the far-off music came to him not as sound but as a rhythmic pressure in his ears out of which arose the incomplete cadenzas of the trumpets . For a moment the Colonel wondered the occasion of the music , then relapsed into his own meditations again . Where the East Florence road merged into Market Street , the makings of a crowd were moving with the Colonel toward Courthouse Square . Presently someone clapped the Colonel 's shoulder and called in blustery humor : " Colonel , I was just looking for you . I went around to the store , and they told me you had flew the coop . " Miltiades blinked his eyes and reentered the world about him . " Yes , I 've quit the store . " " When am I going to rent you that house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but precarious circumstances . " You probably wo n't rent it . " Bradley closed an eye against his cigar smoke . " Oh , come now , do n't say that , unless you mean I 'm going to sell it to you instead of rent it . " " When I 'm out of a job it is n't much of a time to talk selling to me . " Bradley was an astute man . Now , when the Colonel alluded to his loss of a job and pleaded poverty , the realestateagent immediately scented money somewhere . Bradley was astonished at this , and not absolutely certain , but itp208did sound as if the Colonel , somehow or other , had come into some money . " Now , see here , " he began earnestly , " if you should want to buy , I can put you in connection with any piece of property you take a fancy to . I 'll make you a figger on any damn house in town you want . " " I do n't want any house , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want a house , " said Bradley . The real-estate man felt in his pocket among an assortment of cheroots , cheap cigars , and ordinary cigars . He offered the Colonel a cigar . " Smoke this and make up your mind what you want . " The Colonel bit the end off it , and Bradley lighted it for him . " What 's the band playing for ? " asked Miltiades . The real-estate man stared as if the Colonel had taken leave of his senses .  --  " For the Democratic rally , of course . . . . Tomorrow 's election day . " " Oh . . . yes . . . of course . " Miltiades had a doped feeling as if election day had happened a long time ago . " We 're bound to win , " weaned Bradley . " Wall Street 's betting five to three on Cleveland . When a Democrat steps in the White House , I expect to get my share of the flush times that are bound to follow . " " I imagine all of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're already on the way . Do you know what I 've been doing ? " " No , I do n't . " " Been to East Florence to see about a site for a fertilizer factory . Got a commission out of the mail this morning to pick out a factory site . Think of that , a big thin g like a fertilizer factory ! I say Hurray for Cleveland , by God ! " Bradley waved his hat and fell to laughing . The ebullience of Bradley caught Miltiades up , and the Colonel walked on home elated over the coming politicalp209rebirth of the South . This would be the first Democratic President since the war . It seemed a miracle that a man representing the sentiments of the Southern people should ascend to the control of the whole country . It was as if the gray armies of the confederacy had arisen from lost fields to march on to an ultimate victory . The final answer to illiterate black voters who , a few years ago , had swarmed to the polls and forced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Democratic President ! The autumn day caught up the splendor of the Colonel 's mood . The oaks on the college campus flung crimson leaves down the wind . At the very moment that he walked along Market Street , fortune beckoned from every house and vacant lot . All one had to do now was to buy something and float to wealth on the swelling prices of a coming prosperity . And he , Colonel Miltiades Vaiden , had maneuvered himself into position to found a great family fortune . If only he could proceed freely to use the money in his hands . But the moment the negroes let loose the secret of the towboat , the Handbacks would give him a lot of trouble . They would surely seize any property he might purchase . The Colonel thought of buying property in his wife 's name , but that would be too transparent . The courts would set that aside . As Miltiades turned off toward Cherry Street , a very extraordinary idea struck him : to go to Handback and have it out with him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as imprudent as a jump in the dark , but the simple belligerence of the idea appealed to the Colonel . To go to Handback and have it out ! He kept turning the notion over and over , looking at it with a kind of quiver of anticipation . When the Colonel reached home , Ponny had the twelve o'clock meal ready . She was curious to know where he had been , and he said Tuscumbia . His fat wife looked at him blankly . " Did somebody give you a ride over there ? "  | " No , I went on the train . " " You went on the -- Why , Mr. Milt , what on earth did you want to go to Tuscumbia for ? " The Colonel began telling her about Knoblett and his collection of relics . Ponny had n't the slightest interest in the collection . " The idyah of you just going over to Tuscumbia ! " Ponny could n't understand it . " Dinner 's ready . . . . Mr. Milt , you 're goin ' to haff to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . How much did it cost you ? " " The round trip was thirty-eight cents . " " Well . . . I do n't see . . . " She stopped talking and moved heavily into the kitchen . " Ponny , I think I can promise you a nigger to help you in the near future , " said Miltiades . " Well . . . I 'm going to haff to have one . . . . I got some turnups this mornin ' . " " Who from ? " " Buck Mosely brought ' em . . . . I was wonderin ' if we could n't get one of Buck 's girls to do our work . Maybe we would n't have to pay her anything , coming off your own place . . . jest feed and clothe her . " " I could take that up with Cassandra . " " I know Cassandra would n't care . I kai n't see what in the world made you go to Tuscumbia . " An impulse to tell Ponny the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for words to begin , but what he had done suddenly appeared as untellable . He could not start . The fat woman had studied her husband 's face for twenty years . " Mr. Milt , what 's the matter ? " she asked uneasily . He drew in a breath to say : " I 'm going down to Handback 's to have it out with him , " but he changed it to : " Nothing , nothing at all , Ponny . . . . I 've got to go downtown again after dinner . I may not be back till late . "  | " How late ? " " I do n't know . I 'll be back as soon as I can . " He thought again : " Damn it , I ought to tell her . . . . Suppose somebody else should tell her . . . . " He broke off his own thought with a disturbed feeling . He finished his dinner , entertaining the fat woman with an account of how Bradley had tried to sell him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sooner than you imagine , perhaps , " nodded the Colonel . " Well , he could be pretty slow and do that , " said Ponny . That afternoon , when the Colonel started for town again , a countryman in a dilapidated buggy picked him up on Market Street . Immediately he regretted getting into the buggy . The Colonel wanted to think about what he was going to say to Handback , but the countryman talked all the way downtown . He said he had picked Miltiades up because the Vaidens were country folks just like he was . He said he would n't pull a derned stuck-up little town johnny out of a mud hole . He said he was coming in town the day before the election because , by Gad , he did n't intend to come to the election itself tomorrow . He said the thievish Republicans was shore to steal the election anyway , and he did n't want to give them the satisfaction of killing his vote . The old man 's talk creaked on like a water mill . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . but he could plan nothing at all of what he was about to do . Downtown , the Colonel climbed out of the buggy on Market Street and turned off for the store . A larger crowd of negroes than usual stood before the entrance of the Handback store . The nearness of the election had brought them to town . They kept up the usual stir of black folk , some jigging , some talking loudly , some preternaturallygrave . The crowd recalled to Miltiades ' mind the first day he had ever come to the store as a clerk , and now here he was , after many fortuities , walking in for a final accounting . As he moved through the crowd , one old negro thrust a bucket into his hand and said : " Coll , I been waitin ' fuh you . . . I want some lard . " " I 've quit the store , " said Miltiades without glancing around . " I do n't work here any more . " The black man dropped behind him , mumbling : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now dey ai n't no wayto git nothin ' out o ' dis sto ' . " The dark interior of the store was swarming with black customers . Love and Stebbins were wrapping up goods and computing the balances on due bills . At the notion counter a negro was blowing a melancholy tune on a mouth harmonica to see if he wanted to buy it . He played a wailing melody with a queer snoring accompaniment . Even in the midst of the milling negroes the music somehow suggested night and a morass and some lost traveler calling for help . The tune harassed the Colonel 's keyed-up mood . He wasabout to speak to the black boy when Lucius Handback said : " Damn it , nigger , buy the harp or put it back . " The negro reluctantly put it back in the box . The railed-off bookkeeper 's pen in the rear of the store was unoccupied . When Miltiades saw this a surge of relief went through his nerves , and only then did he realize how much he dreaded his interview with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll go home . I do n't know when he 'll be in . I ca n't be waiting here indefinitely . " He had an impulse to walk quickly to the door , but he did not do it . He moved back deliberately , he had no reason to hurry . Dalrymple Love caught sight of him and called genially : " Hello , Colonel , come back to help us out ? " " No , just dropped in to see Mr. Handback a minute . " " He 's out , " said Love .   " Drop around another time . . . . You boys getting on all right ? " " We set up at night , " laughed Love . " What do you mean . . sit up at night ? " The Colonel was really curious . " Watching for burglars . " " What burglars ? " " Well , they 're in the papers . Me and Stebbins figger if they come to Florence we 'll ketch ' em an ' git the reward . " A negro standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bu'glahs , white boy , yo ' reward gwi ' be a coffin . " " There 's Mr. Handback now , " said Love ; then he raised his voice : " Mr. Handback , here 's the Colonel come to see you . " " Well . . . well , " said the merchant in an odd tone , advancing toward Miltiades through his black customers , " I was just wanting to see you , Colonel . " " That 's good , " said Miltiades , hoping the merchant had not heard about the cotton . " Let 's go back to the desk , " said the merchant . Handback had changed in the weeks since Miltiades hadleft him . His face was whiter , his eyes were not so full , hisfeatures were drawn , and he seemed grayer about the temples . When the two were safely behind the rail , the merchantlooked at his former clerk intently . " Bradley tells me you have come into a lot of money , " he said in a queer tone . " Bradley ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Bradley . " What 's Bradley ? " " Why , the real-estate man ! " snapped Handback . " You know Bill Bradley ! " " Why does he say I have a lot of money ? " demanded the Colonel , who did not even recall talking to Bradley . " I do n't know , but he thinks you have . " " How come him to mention me at all ? " demanded Miltiades , excited and puzzled .   " He was after me about that damned shoe store . I told him I did n't have the money , and he said , Why do n't you borrow the money from your old clerk ? ' " Of a sudden Miltiades guessed that Handback somehow had got wind that he had money and now he wanted to borrow it . A twitch of irony went through the Colonel 's mood . " I have n't any money , " he said , " and if I had , I would remember the money I let you have once , Mr. Handback . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Handback elaborately . " I was thinking about you last night . I was wondering how I could pay even part of my debts and keep my business going , and you popped into my head . The way you left me down at the river , so damned careful of my feelings . . . then today Bradley saying you had come into some money . . . " Handback paused , looking intently at the Colonel . " Is that why you wanted to see me , " snapped the Colonel . " because you thought of me last night , and Bradley mentionedme this morning ? " " Not by a long shot . I went out among the niggers and begun inquiring about my cotton . Nobody knew anything about it till I struck Fo ' Spot . lie said maybe it was washed away and maybe a towboat took it . I said , What makes you think a towboat took it ? ' He said , Well , one thing , I he'p load it on the Zeb'lon D. ' " The merchant began a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made him think it . " A quiver of the pleasure and the power of anger swept through the Colonel . " That 's exactly what I came here to tell you , " he nodded crisply . " I 'm damned glad Fo ' Spot saved me the trouble . " " To tell me ! " " Hell , yes , what else would I want to see you for ? " There was a silence . Handback began trembling . " Where is the money , Milt ? " The Colonel leaned across and tapped the smaller man on the chest.  | " It 's . . . paying . . . for . . . the cotton . . . you . . stole . . . from . . . me . . . right . . . after . . the . . . war . " The shorter man swore an oath and jerked open a drawer in his desk . Miltiades jammed an arm into the open drawer and felt a pistol . At that moment the drawer rammed shut on his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head . A gong-like ring and flames of fire filled the Colonel 's ears and eyes . With his free hand he caught the smaller man 's throat . An odd fight ensued : Handback pounding at Miltiades ' face and jamming the drawer shut on his hand ; Miltiades jerking at the pistol in the drawer and sinking his fingers into the merchant 's throat . At the fight under the bright illumination the whole store fell into an uproar . Negroes yelled . A voice shouted : " Colonel 's got a gun ! " And black men scrambled and fought to get to the door . Behind the notion counter Lucius Handback jerked open the cash drawer and got another revolver . Miltiades saw the son running toward his father with the weapon . He swung Handback around and succeeded in jerking his hand out of the drawer , but left the pistol in it . He began backing Handback to the gate in the railing . Lucius was right on them , watching for a shot . He pushed his revolver past his father 's body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught the youth from behind . The pistol fired through the skylight . Lucius was now cursing and trying to shoot the negro who had him in his arms . The colored man , frightened in his turn , was yelling : " Hol ' on ! Hol ' on , Mistuh Lucius ! Don ' shoot me ! Don ' shoot de Coll ! " Miltiades jounced Handback before him toward the door . A man with a policeman 's star forced his way through the pandemonium . He made toward Miltiades and Handback .   " Here , you 're under arrest , " he shouted . " Stop that ! What in the hell are you two old men fighting about ? " " He 's a thief ! " yelled Handback . " That cotton thatwashed away ! He stole ever ' bale of it ! " " Stole it ! " cried the officer , coming up and stopping the men . " Shipped it out on a towboat ! " " The Colonel did ! Why , Mr. Handback , you 're bound to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been owing me ever since he bankruptedtwenty years ago ! " quivered Miltiades . " Well , well , gentlemen ! " cried the officer , amazed . " I 'll have to arrest you both . " He noticed the negro still holding desperately to Lucius and the pistol . " What the hell are you doing , nigger ? " he shouted . The officer strode over and struck the negro on the head with his billy . " You black hound , fighting a white man ! Come on with me ! " Lucius wheeled to fire , but the policeman grabbed his arm . " Do n't kill him ! He deserves it , but do n't kill him ! " The policeman took the negro and marched him toward the door . " I 'll have to ask you gentlemen to come along with me , " he said to the two white men . " I came here to tell Handback I had collected the debt he owed me , " panted the Colonel ; " he got mad and tried to shoot me ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " cried the merchant . The Colonel struck at the merchant again , but the policemanstopped him.  |p217WHEN  the officer and his three prisoners arrived at the police court , the crowd which followed them reached around two blocks . Stragglers in the tail of the procession inquired of those farther up what all the disturbance was about . The man addressed would fling back some such exciting information as : " J. Handback shot Colonel Vaiden ! " " Caught him stealin ' ! " " My God , you do n't mean to say he was the burglars ! " " Must have been ! We got to hurry if we get a seat in the courtroom ! " This last statement was correct . There were no seats left in the courtroom . Men already had hurried and filled up the benches . They lined the walls like a regiment . Countrymenwith the habits of the field hunkered down on their toes in the aisles as if they were there for the day . When the policeman and his prisoners entered the courtroomit was full . The officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and J. Handback , the wealthiest man in town . " I 've sent for the mayor , " he said ; " he 'll be here in a minute . " The Colonel looked around the room at the faces . Outside the door he could see them piled on top of each other , peeringinside . He could sense how amazed everyone was that he was in trouble . He had never been arraigned in court before . The only trial in which he had ever had a part was that of his dead brother Polycarp . Now the thought of Polycarp 's trial came back to him and then faded away again , leaving him in the police court facing his own .   A queer , disagreeable satisfaction filled Miltiades at this violent outcome of his project . It was the satisfaction of a man who will at last have a question settled one way or the other . He did not look at J. Handback , but could feel the merchant looking at him . Presently there was a pushing in the crowded doorway . Voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way for Mayor Dibble ! " There was a great pushing near the door to let him through . The mayor was a tall thin man with an emaciated face and reddish eyes . Now he entered the courtroom looking at the prisoners with concern and astonishment in his lined face . When the policeman saw him the officer ordered the squatters to clear the aisle and let the mayor through . Mayor Dibble got to the magisterial chair on the platform and looked at the negro . " What 's the nigger doing in this case ? " demanded Dibble . " Why , he was scuffling with Lucius Handback , " charged the officer . " What 's your name ? " asked the mayor of the negro . " Loob Snipes , " said the negro in a quick voice . " Whose nigger are you ? " " I works fuh Mistah Han'back , " said Loob . " And you were scuffling with Mr. Lucius Handback ! " cried the judge in surprise . " Well , looky heah , Jedge , dish here was de way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was already weary of the negro 's case ; they wanted to get on with the white men 's cases . " Look here , nigger , who 's going to pay your fine , " inquiredthe judge , " if you were fighting Lucius Handback and you 're a Handback nigger ? " Miltiades spoke up . " I 'll pay his fine . That nigger kept Lucius Handback from shooting me with a pistol . That 's all he was doing , Mayor , keeping Lucius Handback from killing me . " " Let him off with five dollars and the cost , " said thep219mayor . " Now , what 's the charge against these gentlemen ? " The negro was straightway forgotten . " They were fightin ' , " said the officer ; " they were ' ras'lin ' with each other when I come in the store and settled ' em . " " What was the cause ?

" I simply collected an old debt he owed me ! " declared Miltiades . " That 's an outrageous falsehood . I did n't owe him . . . . " The Colonel whirled to strike at Handback again , but the policeman caught him . " Put ' em on opposite sides of the courtroom , " directed the mayor . When the men were separated , the judge of the court asked : " Did you attack Colonel Vaiden , Mr. Handback ? " " I do n't know whether I did or not , " said Handbackangrily ; " he was reaching in the drawer of my desk for mypistol . " " Your pistol ! " ejaculated Dibble . " Do you mean to say the Colonel entered your store and tried to draw your own pistol on you because he had shipped cotton which you allege belonged to you ? " " I do n't know what he came to my store for ! " cried Handbackangrily . " I went there to tell him his debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And you both got mad and got into a fight over it ? " suggested the mayor . " Well , I was n't mad , " said the Colonel , " but when he hit me , I choked him and made him stop . " " I see , you remonstrated with him by choking him , " nodded the mayor . Some laughter broke out in the courtroom at this remark.  | " Look here ! " cried Handback , " the point is he 's got between forty and fifty thousand dollars of my money . " " Were you trying to get that back by mauling him ? " inquired Dibble . " I was mad . . . . No , I knew I was n't going to get my money back that way , of course . " " Well , gentlemen , " said the judge , " this is simply another case of disorderly conduct . You both admit it . Mr. Handbackwas trying to collect money by hammering the Colonel in the face , and the Colonel was resisting collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five dollars and the costs . " " But , look here ! " cried Handback , jumping to his feet , " that man has stolen forty or fifty thousand dollars of my money ! Is this all the satisfaction I get ? " " Mr. Handback ! You know you do n't try a charge like that in a police court ! " snapped the mayor . " And you do n't bring such an action viva voce . You must seek your remedy for that offense elsewhere . Both you men were fighting , and I 'm fining each of you five dollars and the cost . That 's all . "   AS MILTIADES VAIDEN walked out of the police court , the thought that filled his mind was , " Now everybody in Florence knows what became of the Handback cotton . " This knowledgeblew like a wind through his nerves . It was said to him in a hundred different ways . The crowd , as he walked out of the courtroom , gave him more than enough space . They set him in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred curious and incredulous faces . It was in the voices of the few who spoke to him . The Colonel moved along the street toward his home in the midst of a crowd , yet in a little physical pool of isolation . He reminded himself a little of Landers , but this spiritual discomfort seemed temporary because all the discomfortshe had ever known eventually had passed away . As the Colonel walked along he could feel the news of his theft spreading through Florence , out into the country , everywhere . It would go to Cassandra , to his sister Marcia up in Tennessee , to Augustus and Rose and Sylvester and Lycurgus ; he could feel the shock of dismay in his absent brothers and sisters when they heard the news . He put his family forcibly out of his mind and made himselfthink what steps he should take next . He would , he supposed , presently be taken with a warrant . The thought of being arrested in the street was disagreeable to him , and he hurried his steps toward home . As he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was adjusting his pace to his own . A suspicion that it was Mayhew , the sheriff , disturbed the Colonel . He would not look around . He would not speed up his gait ; he slackened it ; the person behind him , slacked off too . Out of the corner of his eye Miltiades could see the other man 's shadow . The Colonel had meant to go up Market Street , but now , to test the shadow and see if it were following him , the Colonel turned a block west and turned into Pine . At the corner the man behind him quickened his pace and came up to Miltiades . " May I have a word with you , Colonel ? " said a hill voice . The Colonel stopped and looked around in considerable surprise . The smallish and rather oldish man who had followedhim appeared vaguely familiar . He was dressed cheaply but neatly , after the fashion of country folk when they come to town . " What can I do for you ? " asked the Colonel . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch of embarrassment , " I was wondering if you had thought of putting Mr. Handback and his boy under a peace warrant  --  " the fellow moistened his lips with his tongue  --  " riot that it 's any of my business . " Such a suggestion from such a person confounded the Colonel . " What would I put them under a warrant for ? " " Because they lit into you without cause . Lucius Handbackeven shot at you . If it had n't been for that nigger , Loob Snipes , he 'd ' a ' hit you . " " Do you imagine I 'm afraid of the Handbacks ? " " There , I knew you 'd say that , " nodded the rustic , gatheringcourage . " It is n't a question of being afraid at all . Of course , they wo n't try to do you any more physical harm . You know that , and so do I. " " Then why place them under a peace warrant ? " inquired Miltiades . " Why , to get them on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their attention by having them make out a peace bond to keep out of jail . It 'll make the people think that you have been mistreated. "  |p223Such  partisanship in his own behalf bewildered Miltiades . " Look here , " said the Colonel , " your face seems familiar , but just at this moment I ca n't recall . . . " As he said this a small boy 's derisive yodel broke out across the street : " Hey , look at Jaky Sandusky , trying to be a lawyer ! Look at Sandusky trying to get a case ! " The oldish youth glanced across at the small boys with the intense despisal of the countryman for the town dweller . " You damn little brats ! " he said . A this point Miltiades identified the boarder at Mrs. Rose 's boarding house . It also explained why the fellow had taken such a complete Vaiden view of the case . He had no doubt heard Augustus talk about the cotton . It comforted Miltiades intimately to know that Augustus had taken a pro-Vaiden view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a different tone , " I wo n't swear out a peace warrant , Mr. Sandusky . How came you to think about it ? " " Well , I asked Governor O'Shawn what he would do about your case , and he said he believed he would make the Handbacks scratch their way out . " " Why did you ask Governor O'Shawn about the matter ? " inquired the Colonel curiously . " I read law in his office . When anything comes up , I ask him about it . " " Well , tha  --  that 's commendable , " hesitated Miltiades , rather embarrassed to know that Terry O'Shawn already knew of his peculation ; " but I do n't think I 'll swear out the peace warrant , after all . " " The Handbacks will do something , " warned Sandusky . " I imagine they will , " agreed the Colonel seriously . " If they do , you 'll need a lawyer . . . why do n't youtake the Governor ? " inquired Sandusky gingerly . " I will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll sort of watch out for you , if it 's all right ? " suggested Sandusky .   " I wo n't have any trouble hiring a lawyer , " replied the Colonel unencouragingly . " Well . . all right . . . . " And the boarder touched his hat awkwardly and turned back toward town . Across the street the small boys who had been listening to this set up a clamor : " Sandusky lost out ! Oh-oh ! Jaky Sandusky lost out ! Ho ! Ho ! " And a shrill falsetto shrieking : " Jaky Sandusky 's stuck on Sydna Crowninshield ! Hay ! Hay ! What ye know about that ! " The shrilling of the youngsters lingered in Miltiades ' ears for a moment or two and presently gave way to his constant concern as to what the Handbacks were likely to do . Sandusky 's advice about making the first move might be good . O'Shawn , apparently , had suggested it . The fact that he had voluntarily gone to the Handbacks ' store and entered into conversation about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jury . A gratification went through Miltiades that he had acted just as he did . It might very well change any action that was brought against him from a criminal suit to a civil suit . The Colonel 's ponderings were a little disturbed by the small boys who had deserted Sandusky and who were now following him tentatively along Pine Street , saying something in undertones and breaking into loud laughter at whatever it was . Once the Colonel looked around at them , and the laughter lost its morale and was reduced to a tittering . The urchins dropped off eventually , and the Colonel walked on up Pine Street , thinking again about the Handbacksand then about Gracie . From Gracie he went to Drusilla . He hurried his steps to be past Drusilla 's home . He wondered in annoyance why he had ever come past the Crowninshield residence ; then he remembered Sandusky had caused this choice of route.  |p225At  the end of Pine Street Miltiades turned over toward Market . A browned man in a broadish hat sat on a horse where the cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Miltiades as he recognized the motionless figure of the horseman waiting for him in the afternoon sunshine . He had an impulse to turn and walk back the way he had come , but he continued forward . " Hey-oh , Mayhew , " he said , as he started to pass by . " Hello , Colonel , " said the horseman in a careful tone . " I just rode up to your house , Colonel . You wa' n't at home . I figgered out you 'd took a side street , so I rode back and waited here where I knowed you 'd have to come . " A kind of repulsion went through the Colonel at the sheriff 's miserable English when arresting him . " Did you want me ? " " Yes , of man Han'back swore out a state 's warrant for you while ago . I 'll read it to you . " Miltiades stopped beside the sheriff and stood looking up at him . " You need n't read it . " " Well . . . all right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Miltiades nodded . He paused a moment and then asked : " Where do we go now ? " " Why , I 'm afraid I 'm goin ' to haff to take you backdowntown with me . . . I mean till you make your bond . " He got off his horse to lead the animal and walk backbeside the Colonel . " We might go down Pine Street , " suggested Mayhew ; " not much passing on it . " Miltiades agreed to this mutely . He felt Mayhew 's consideration . They turned to walk back down Pine Street with the horse behind them . The thoroughfare was almost deserted . A gray-wooled negro raked up leaves on a lawn . To the Colonel the windows of the houses which they passed had the effect of the eyes of a multitude . The whole street seemed silently noting his arrest . He felt as if he werep226moving beside the sheriff on a high elevated ridge , a kind of prolonged pedestal which held him up to every eye . As the two men walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cotton , " and a tittering . For a moment or two it did not occur to Miltiades that the call had any reference to him . It arose a little louder , " Steamboat Cotton ! " More giggling , then a cry of " Barge Cotton ! TowboatCotton ! " Sheriff Mayhew whirled around . " Here , you little devils ! " he threatened ; " shut that up and get on home , or I 'll take you to jail too ! " The gang of little boys retreated a way , then broke into a shrill chanting : " There goes Colonel Towboat Cotton and the sher'f ! There goes Colonel Towboat Cotton and the sher'f ! " They shrieked with laughter at their song . Miltiades clenched his fingers with desire to choke their scrawny throats . Suddenly he observed that he was in front of the Crowninshield home . " Come on , " he said to Mayhew with a dry mouth , " let 's move on ! " The sheriff was as furious as his prisoner . " I 'll pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that moment a slender girl came running out of the Crowninshield gate . She dashed across the road into the gang . " You bad little boys ! " she cried . " You are mean ! You are outrageous ! I 'll tell your mothers on you ! I 'll tell your mothers on every single one of you ! " She was crying . She spread her arms and bore down on them as if she would physically stop their advance . The gang fell back shouting : " Oh , we ai n't skeered of you ! You ca n't do nothing to us ! Miss Jerry Catlin ! Miss Jerry Catlin ! " They went trooping back up the street hooting this new jest and were gone.  |p227The  two men looked after the vanishing children still vibrating with detestation . " Was n't that Miss Sydna Crowninshield ? " asked the sheriff . " Yes , " said the Colonel . " I did n't know she was a particular friend of yours . " " Neither did I , " said the Colonel , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . P228THE jail put an end to the riddle of Sydna Crowninshield 's partisanship in Colonel Vaiden 's thoughts . The small ironbarredwindows in the brick wall dismayed him . When he , entered the door the place had a smell reminiscent of an animal cage . Frierson , the jailer , came to the front door , blinking a little because he had just got up from a game of checkers with Biggars , the fireman . The jailer put on an unusual gravity when he saw who was the prisoner . " I suppose Colonel Vaiden will stay here till he makes bond , " he suggested to Mayhew . " Of course I want to make bond , " said the Colonel . " How much is it ? " " It is n't set , " said the sheriff . " We have n't had any preliminarytrial yet to set the bond . " He pulled a silver watch out of his pocket . " It 's too late for a preliminary now . " " But , my God ! " ejaculated Frierson , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all night , I hope ! " " If we ca n't get a preliminary trial to set his bond , " saidMayhew , " I do n't see as there 's anything else to do . " The Colonel looked at Mayhew with rising anger . " Why in the hell did n't you arrest me sooner ? " " I could n't arrest you without a warrant , " flung out Mayhew , with an officer 's readiness to take offense . " I did n't get your warrant till a little while ago . " " Look here , " put in the jailer , trying to arrange the matter , " you did n't have any trouble ketching him , did you , Mayhew ? " " Of course he did n't , " said the Colonel . " Besides that , he went to the Handbacks ' store and toldP229'em what he had done . That shows he 's not trying to get away . Why not turn him loose under his own recognizance ? " Mayhew stood shaking his head slowly . " Frierson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , but one running up into the forty thousands of dollars . . . " the sheriff shook his head more positively , " no , I 'm not wanting my bondsmen to be out scratching up forty thousand dollars to pay over to the Handbacks . They 've got enough money already . " Laney Biggars , the fireman who had been playingcheckers with Frierson , came out of the jailer 's office . " Mayhew , I 'll go on Colonel Milt 's bond , " he offered . The sheriff pulled down his mouth in a laugh . " Lancy , did you ever stop to figger how many fellers like you it ' ud take to make good a forty-thousand-dollar bond ? Damn if it would n't take forty thousand dollars ' worth of legal cap for you boys to sign your names to . " " But , look here , tomorrow 's election day , " pointed out the jailer earnestly , " you know you 're not going to get no trial held on election day . " " Frierson , why in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details when he took the cotton ? " demanded the sheriff . " Well , I tell you what I 'm going to do , " stated Frierson , " I 'm going to turn the Colonel loose and tell him to report to me in the . morning . I let half my niggers go home at night , and I never see ' em except at meal times . " " Look here , Frierson , the Lauderdale County jail is supposedto be a place of safe keeping . If you 're going to act thatta way , I 'll take him over to Tuscumbia and lodge him there . " " No , do n't do that , " interposed Frierson . " I get twenty cents a day for lodging prisoners , and I might as well have it as the Tuscumbia jailer . " The two officers stood pondering how to keep the Colonel in jail and at the same time let him go free.  | " I have it , " said Mayhew at last , " why not let the Colonel put up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Cash bond ! " " How much ? " asked Miltiades . " Oh , about fifteen hundred dollars  --  that 's about what your bond would be . Could you put that up , Colonel ? " " Why-y , no-o , " said Miltiades doubtfully , " I could n't put up that much . " " Why , that 's out of all reason ! " cried the jailer . " Well , damn it , anything , " cried the sheriff , " a thousand , five hundred . . . name the figger yourself . I want a little assurance my prisoner will come back here tomorrow . I 'm responsible for him , ai n't I ? " " What makes you think he can make a cash bond ? " " I said , if he could . " In the midst of this endless and unprogressive talk the jail door opened and a smallish , cheaply clad youth entered . This time , within half a minute , Miltiades recognized the undistinguished features of Sandusky . " I heard you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather breathlessly , as if he had been running . " Yes , I 'm here , " said the Colonel , who was unaware that he had any connection with Sandusky . " Well , I got a couple of men to go on your bond  --  Mr. Augustus Vaiden and Mr. Landers , the postmaster . " " There ai n't no bond , " said Mayhew ; " we have n't had no hearing yet , and they ai n't none set . " Sandusky stared blankly at this . " You 're not going to keep him in jail all night , are you ? " The sheriff looked at Sandusky with distaste . " Colonel , let me have a little private talk with you , " suggested that youth . Miltiades had no desire to have a private talk with Sandusky . " What have you got to do with this , anyway ? " asked Mayhew of Mrs. Rose 's boarder . " I could be the Colonel 's counsel , " said Sandusky .   " Are you a lawyer ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What in the hell 's the Governor got to do with this ? " " Hell , go on and talk , " interposed Frierson , " I 've no objections , and you 're both in my jail . You can use my office right in there . " " Do n't muss up that checker game we left on the table , " put in Biggars . " Hell , muss it up if you need the table , " said the jailer . Inside the office , Sandusky closed the door on the men in the hallway . " Look here , Colonel , " began Sandusky in a quick undertone , " the Governor thinks it would be a good thing for you to sit tight jest like you are and let ' em put you in jail ! " " How came the Governor to think anything at all about me ? " ejaculated Miltiades . " I ast him . " " Well . . . why should I stay in jail if I can get out ? " " Because he says Handback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , and you 'll have an action against him for false arrest and damages to character and reputation . " Sandusky was sharply excited . His fingers picked up and put down the checker men . " When did the Governor tell you all this ? " queried Miltiades . " Why , since I left you , " hurried Sandusky . " You see the Handbacks are the richest firm in Florence . No jury will like them putting you in jail . They 'll give you a lot o ' damage . " " Well . . . all right . . . " agreed Miltiades slowly . And he went back in the hall and told the men that he would not try to make bond . When the other men had gone , Frierson , the jailer , stood in the hallway with his prisoner and said in perplexity : " Now , by jiggers , I do n't understand Mayhew at all . What earthly dif'runce does it make to him if I keep you in jail tonight or let you go home so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I do n't know , " said Miltiades absently , overlooking the question in the gray fact that he was in jail . " Me neither , " said Frierson , " I never thought Mayhew was a spiteful man . He has n't got a grudge against you , has he ? " " Not that I know of . " Then the Colonel thought of the little boys mocking him in Pine Street . He knew that the malice of children was usually based on the dislike of the parents , so he added , " I really do n't know who likes me and who dislikes me . I never have paid much attention to it . " " No , you " The jailer broke off whatever it was he was about to say and substituted : " Well , if you do n't mind , Colonel . . . " There was a melancholy slope of steps leading from the hall into the upper story . Frierson indicated these steps . " This jail is really rigged up for niggers , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to keep the corner cell with two winders in it for white men . . . and usually I do . " The Colonel preceded the jailer upstairs and entered the iron-barred simplicity of the upper story . It smelled of black men . Frierson produced a key and unlocked the corner cell . " I 'm to go in here ? " asked the Colonel in a queer voice . " I 'll send up my wife to change the cover on your bunk , " suggested Frierson . Miltiades went inside and felt the blankets . They were stiff with dirt . " Be right back , " said the jailer , " you can jest  --  er  --  set down , Colonel  --  an ' make yourself at home . " Frierson did not turn the key in the lock , but went hurryingback downstairs to send up his wife with clean bedclothes . There was nothing for the Colonel to do except sit on the bunk.  |p233The  last rays of the sun fell through a narrow window and painted the black shadow of its bars on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at this complexity of color and design without thinking of it . Just one physical fact gripped his mind : he was in jail . He felt slimy , as if he had been dropped into a cesspool . The flesh of his buttocks twisted away from the blankets he sat on , and presently he stood up . He thought of a man who owned forty-eight thousand dollars spending the night in such a place ! But the forty-eight thousand which had got him into jail now did an odd thing . It stiffened the Colonel 's feeling of superiority , of being untouched by his surroundings . He wondered if Gracie would betray her trust ? Following his thought of Gracie came the image of Drusilla , as if the quadroon and the aristocratic woman were linked by some obscure mental chain . He thought of Drusilla blankly , then of her daughter Sydna ; how Sydna had run out into the street to defend him against the urchins . Then he realized that nobody had told Ponny where he was . He supposed the Klems would tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her incredulity , her shock . It occurred to him that if his marriage with Ponny had brought him the money he had expected he would never have been where he was now . The door to the steps opened , and a light entered the upper story . Then Frierson appeared , followed by his wife with an armful of bedclothes . The jailer entered and held the lamp while his wife whisked off the offensive covers . " We do n't try to keep these beds clean any more , " explained the woman . " We did for a while , but the drunks act so bad . . . . I 'll bring you up a new pot , too , when I go down again . " The Colonel almost said , " Do n't put yourself to anytrouble " ; but if he were to get any manner of rest in thenoisome cell she would have to put herself to some trouble . As the jailer 's wife worked briskly , flinging out the clean linen in the air and letting it settle smoothly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess you do n't know me , Colonel ? " " You are Mrs. Frierson ? " " Oh , yes . I mean before I was married . " " Well . . . no-o . . . I 'm afraid I do n't know your maiden name . " " Do n't you remember the little girl who used to come to the old Lacefield place once in a while with Eliza Ham ? " Miltiades recalled Eliza Ham but not the child . " Are you that little girl ? " " Yes , I was Eliza Ham 's niece , " nodded the woman , with the back of her head toward the Colonel . " I tell Joe , there 's never a bit of telling who we 'll be called on next to entertain . A year or so ago Martha Killicut was here  --  did you know Martha ? " " No . . . I do n't believe I did . " " She killed her baby when it was born , " explained Mrs. Frierson , faintly embarrassed . A glimmering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Miltiades . " Martha Killicut . . . Martha Killicut . . . " he repeated , trying to capture the memory . " Folks called her old Marth , " prompted Mrs. Frierson , " although she was n't so very old . " This tag of " Old Marth " completed the Colonel 's recognition . " I remember the name . . . I heard something about her , somewhere . . . . " Both the jailer and his wife were disappointed not to learn what the Colonel almost recalled . The woman had finished the bed . " Joe , " she said , " you might leave the lamp up here . It 'll be comp'ny for Colonel Milt , and it 'll help keep the bugs away . " Joe glanced about and set the lamp on the sheet-iron floor . The two wished the Colonel good-night . This time , Joe locked.  |p235the  door as silently and inconspicuously as possible . The two disappeared down the iron-barred aisle and were gone . Miltiades sat on the clean bedding and looked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He stared at the lamp flame , which burned motionless . The pot , which Mrs. Frierson after all had forgot to exchange , scented the cell . Presently these material data faded from the Colonel 's mind . He began going over and over the incidents leading to this imprisonment as an animal walks back and forth behind its bars . He did not know how long he kept this up . After some length of time someone snored in a near-by cell . A negro 's voice said in an undertone to someone else : " Punch dat niggah , don ' let him ' sturb de Coll wid he snorin ' . " The other cells were full of negroes who had quieted to complete silence with the entrance of the Colonel . But they fell asleep at last , and the jail was filled with the sounds of noisy breathings . Then , out of the treadmill of his thoughts , there popped into Miltiades ' head the recollection of old Martha Killicut . She was the prostitute Landers the postmaster had mentionedat the creek . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' dead sister had spoken to the postmaster through a wandering medium . The strangeness , the uncanniness of this corroboration stumbled upon by accident , here in jail , went through the Colonel with a breath of the outre and the incredible . It produced a strange effect . It created , for a moment , an illusion as if the cell , the lamp , these negro prisoners snoring around him were an insubstantial figment behind which lay an unknown but a profound reality . This fantasy propounded to the Colonel an ironic query . It asked him why he had maneuvered Handback 's cotton down the river , and why he was sitting thus in the filth of this cell to hold the money he had obtained by fraud ? The man in the lamplit cell could not answer this question . He did not know . He did not know why he suffered this ignominy to hold the fortune . He did not know what he would do with the money . He sat pondering for a long time . After a long while a grayness formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood out against the dawn . As it grew lighter , the Colonel got up , extinguished his lamp , and looked out the window . He could see downward into a little alley that led past the jail into Intelligence Row . At first he saw only the narrow slice between the two buildings . In line with this slice were a column and the clock tower of the courthouse . Then , as the shadows in the alley clarified , he saw a tall boy leaning against the wall of a house and staring fixedly at the jail window . The way the youth leaned against the wall and shifted his weight from foot to foot suggested to Miltiades that the watcher had been standing there for a long time . After a few more minutes , as the illumination increased , the Colonel recognized Jerry Catlin , the son of Marcia , his sister . The boy stood watching the prison window that held his uncle . P237VOICES in Courthouse Square were shouting , " Hurrah for Cleveland ! " and somewhere farther away somebody yelled back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughter after the fashion of a person who utters a ridiculous sentimentout of jest . To Miltiades , the fact that it was election day lent a peculiar barb to his imprisonment . He sat on his bunk thinkingthat the men with whom he had fought through the war were making another effort to regain control of national affairs , and he was like this , sitting impotent in the county jail ! If only he had thought of this contretemps he would not have gone to Handback until after election day . However , barring the election , Miltiades was glad he had pushed on into this final scene of his seizure of the cotton . Whatever was going to happen to him was now in process of being worked out . His waiting was over . Two cells distant from his own a negro 's voice asked humbly and apprehensively : " Coll , if'n de Democrats gits ' lected , will us niggahs haff to go back lak we wuz befo ' de wah ? " " Of course not , " said the Colonel , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , then ? " " They 'll run the country to suit the South . We 'll have prosperity . You niggers will get higher wages , for one thing . " " Lawzee , " ejaculated the negro , " dat 's a ve'y dif'unt tune to what Mistah Landers sings . " " Naturally . He 's got an ax to grind . He wants you to vote the Republican ticket to help him hold his job . "  |p238The  Colonel said this with some sarcasm for the shoddy principle of Landers , trying to scare the negroes into votingthe Republican ticket . The door of the second story creaked open , and the Colonel paused in his silent condemnation of Landers . He listened for scuffling or staggering footsteps . As none came , a qualm seized upon Miltiades lest it was young Jerry Catlin . The Colonel tried to get himself into a dignified attitude . He straightened his tie , then he saw the visitor coming quickly through the corridor toward his cell . Miltiades ' embarrassmentwent away . It was nobody but Sandusky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Colonel , " he said , " I 've been to the Handback store . . been talking to Mr. Handback . " " Well , what did you say ? " asked the Colonel indifferently . " Why , I just told Mr. Handback how it was . . . " Sanduskypaused and looked speculatively through the bars . " What would you give to get out of this , Colonel Vaiden ? " " Out of jail ? " " No , out of the whole thing . Old man Handback swears he 's going to send you to the coal mines . I told him he could n't do it . I told him he appointed you as his agent and let you handle his cotton ; and I told him when you took advantage of your position to collect an old debt he owed you , he simply did n't have any criminal action against you . That 's what I handed him . " The Colonel thought this over . " That 's about what I had in my head all the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sandusky nodded . " Yes , of course , but now , by Jiggs , the court may not hold that . It could mighty easy say it was a simple case of appropriating goods , and it might accidentally turn out like Mr. Handback says . "  | " Look here , which side are you on ? " asked the Colonel , looking uncertainly at the youth . " Neither one nor the other , " said Sandusky . " I 'm trying to show Handback it might turn out to be a civil suit , and I 'm trying to show you it might just as easily turn out to be a criminal suit . What I 'm trying to do is to work up a com-promise . " " Oh ! " ejaculated the Colonel . " That 's your idyah ! " " Yes , that 's why I ast how much would you give to get shed of this whole business . " " I see . . . I see . . . you mean refund Handback some of the money . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to split the money if it settled off ever'thing ? " " Did Handback talk favorably to that ? " " Well . . . I talked to him a long time , and he fin'ly saidhe would n't mind paying you what he once owed you . " " How much did he figure that was ? " inquired the Colonel . " He said it was five hundred dollars , " said Sandusky . " Five hundred ! " Miltiades really was amazed at the merchant'seffrontery . Sandusky nodded , a little at sea himself . " Yes , he said you had five bales of cotton , and as cotton is worth a hundred dollars a bale , that would be five hundred dollars . " " Why , the damned scoundrel ! " cried the Colonel . " He knows as well as I do cotton was selling for a dollar a pound right after the war . My cotton came to twenty-five hundred dollars . " Sandusky held to the bars , thinking over this angle of the settlement . " Look here , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Maybe you two can reach some agreement . After all , you are both honest men , and you want to do each other right . " " When can you bring him ? "  | " Well , as a matter of fact , he 's downstairs . I persuaded him to come down here with me . " " All right , bring him up , " agreed the Colonel , and Sanduskywent hurrying off down the corridor again . In a few minutes the short compact merchant followed Sandusky into the upper story of the jail . Mrs. Rose 's boarder , who had stage-managed the affair very well up to this point , became very nervous now that he actually had his men together . " I  --  I wanted you two g-gentlemen to g-get together and talk this over , " he said , wetting his lips . " Well , I say I do n't owe Colonel Vaiden anything at all , " stated the merchant impersonally , talking to Sandusky , " but , as I told you , I am willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I was forced into bankruptcy . I told you I 'd do that , and now I 'll stick to it . " " So the question is , what is a reasonable amount ? " suggestedSandusky . " A reasonable amount , " said Miltiades from his cell , " is what the cotton would have brought plus interest . " " Interest ! Interest ! " cried Handback . " You ca n't charge me interest after my assignment in bankruptcy ! This is a gift I 'm giving you . I do n't owe you anything . You ca n't charge me interest on a debt I do n't owe ! " " Well , by God , I am doing it , am I not ? " demanded the Colonel crisply . " No , you 're not ! " cried Handback . " You come such a tune as that , and I 'll send you to the coal mines as sure as you 're a foot high ! " Handback was turning back toward the steps . " Wait ! Wait ! " cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before you get a single figger . . . . All right , Colonel Vaiden , how much do you figger your principal and interest comes to ? " " Fifty thousand dollars , to a dot ! " snapped Miltiades . " I 've figured it up a thousand times . " " Fifty thou . . . you mean that 's what my cotton comep241to ! " cried Handback . He stared at the Colonel and began to laugh . " How did you get that figger , Colonel ? " inquired Sandusky . " I charged him fifty per cent per annum , " said Miltiades flatly . " The legal rate 's eight per cent , " reminded Sandusky . " When a man takes your money knowing he is going to make an assignment in three hours and never pay it back , lie 's a thief and puts himself outside the law . I feel justified in collecting anything I can lay my hands on . " " You call me a thief ! " cried Handback , staring in amazementat the Colonel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a clerk and pretending to be my friend . . . . " " Mr. Handback ! Colonel ! " begged Sandusky desperately . " Wo n't you make each other some reasonable offer ? Five hundred dollars is no offer ! To say you are going to charge fifty per cent and keep it all is no offer ! Be reasonable ! " Both men stood silent , Miltiades holding to his bars ; Handback arrested on his way to the door . The Colonel really tried to think of some reasonable thing . " Well , now , listen to this , " growled the Colonel at last , " if the worst comes to the worst , I wo n't be sent to the coal mines for more than five years . Well , I 'd give two thousand dollars a year to keep out of the mines . That 's ever ' cent I 'd give back for a quit-claim deed to what I 've got ; ten thousand dollars . Handback can take it or leave it . " " Hell , I 'll leave it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than that to see you wear stripes for one year . " Sandusky stood in the corridor and watched one of his near clients walk out the door and the other go back to his bunk and sit down . The young man began a half-hearted argument with Miltiades to raise the price he would pay for his assured freedom . " Look here , " he contended , " if Handback and Mayhew get their fingers on the money , they 'll take every cent of it , and you 'll get nothing at all , Colonel . "  | " Get their hands on it ? " queried the Colonel suspiciously . " Sure , get their hands on it . . . . Why do you suppose Mayhew was so bound you should stay in jail all night last night and all day today ? " " Why . . . to keep me safe , I suppose , " said Miltiades looking curiously at the young man . " Well . . . you suppose wrong , " said Sandusky . " Then what did they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm in their confidence , " said Sandusky , " and that 's all I can say . But I 'll add this . If you 'd ever been in the coal mines you 'd give more than two thousand a year to keep out . " Sandusky took himself off , greatly disappointed at the outcome of his meeting , and left Miltiades alone . Outside the jail the election was getting under way . Shouts and hurrahs came through the barred windows . The music of a distant band grew in loudness as it came marchingthrough Courthouse Square . WheN it stopped there broke out a many-voiced shouting for Cleveland . Some voices struck up a drunken song : " See the boat go round the bend . Good-bye , James G. , good-bye . Loaded down with Cleveland men . Good-bye , James G. , good-bye . " When the voting was well under way , Frierson began bringing up drunk men and putting them in the cells . That meant the town calaboose was full , and the jail was receiving the overflow . The Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the election and partly on Sandusky . He wondered what Sandusky had hinted at . He wondered what Handback and Mayhew were doing ? It made him uneasy . Now and then the notion of penal labor in the state coalp243mines flickered in and out of his head . . . . It would be worth , Sandusky had said , more than two thousand a year to keep out of them . How did Sandusky know ? Had he ever worked in one ? There was a newly imprisoned drunk in the cell next to the Colonel 's . The fellow was very sick . He lay groaning on his bed , vomiting occasionally on his blanket and on the steel floor of the cell . His hair was wet from perspiration and appeared combed the wrong way . The sour smell of his ejecta filled the Colonel 's cubicle . In the midst of his groaning the fellow opened his eyes and stared without focus at Miltiades . " You . . . Coll . . . Vaiden ? " he asked thickly . " Yes , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No . " " Y-you di-didn ' ? " " No . " " Well i-it 's uh  --  uh climinal shame , anyway . " " What  --  me not getting drunk ? " " N-no . . . . Th-the woman . " " What woman ? " " Wh-why , th-th ' woman ' at got k-killed . . . " The drunk man wobbled his head vaguely to indicate the direction . At that moment Sandusky came up the corridor again . He was in a greater hurry than ever . " Colonel , " he panted , " they 've . . . taken you up ! " " What do you mean ? " inquired Miltiades . " Taken me up how ? " " Why , the Handbacks ! They 've agreed to settle for the ten thousand dollars . . . . I talked ' em into it . " P244SANDUSKY had drawn up an agreement between the two parties . He handed it to the Colonel through the bars . It was a long paper in rather awkward legal style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It began : " Know all men by these presents , that whereas John Handback of the firm of J. Handback &; Son , doing business in the town of Florence , county of Lauderdale , state of Alabama , hereby acknowledges in behalf of himself and of his firm the following state of facts , viz. , to wit , namely , " First that the firm of J. Handback &; Son is and was justly indebted to Colonel Miltiades Vaiden , residingin Florence , in the county of Lauderdale , state of Alabama , for a certain stun of money for cotton delivered to said firm by Miltiades Vaiden before a certain assignment in bankruptcy made by the firm J. Handback &; Company in the year 1865 . That the said money nor any part of said money has ever been paid and still constitutes a good legal debt against the firm J. Handback &; Son , which is the successor of the firm J. Handback &; Company . " Secondly the said J. Handback engaged Colonel Miltiades Vaiden in the present year and entrusted to him the picking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the plantations of the firm J. Handback &; Son , for the purpose of repaying the said MiltiadesVaiden for the aforesaid outstanding debt . And whereas said cotton has been gathered , shipped and soldp245by the said Miltiades Vaiden , the aforesaid firm of J. Handback &; Son agree to accept the sum of ten thousand dollars as their full and legal residue in the proceedsof said cotton . " Witness our hands and seals , this the 4th day of November 1884 . " Miltiades read this extraordinary document in amazement . " Will they really sign this ? " Sandusky nodded with pride . " Yes , they 'll stick their fists to her . What do you think about how it 's written ? " " What 's written ? " " The agreement . Do n't it sound pretty good ? I made it up myself , some of it , and some I got out of the Legal Guide and Advisor . " The Colonel paid no attention to the pride of the author . " You are sure Handback is willing to sign that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . " " How will I know he 'll do it ? " " I 've arranged to let Frierson hold the paper and the money . He 'll hand the paper to you and the money to Handback . " Miltiades looked again at the extraordinary concession . " I do n't believe he 'll do it . I believe there 's some trick to it . " " Oh , no , he 'll do it , " assured Sandusky excitedly . " You say the word and I 'll go down and have Frierson come up and turn you out now . " " Go ahead , " agreed the Colonel , " and tell ' em if there is a trick to this , two can play at that game . " " It 's no trick , " insisted Sandusky ; " they 'll settle for ten thousand . " Mrs. Rose 's boarder turned and went almost running down the corridor , and Miltiades heard him clattering down the steps to the lower floor . Miltiades , in his cell , puzzled his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally , a possible motive occurred to the Colonel . Handback might intend to follow him and seize the rest of the money by force . The Colonel was still thinking about this when Frierson came leisurely up the corridor , jingling his keys , and opened the cell door . As Miltiades stepped out the jailer said : " This county 's going to poll fifteen thousand for Cleveland . Everybody 's come to town to vote . You never saw such a jam . " " Frierson , " said Miltiades , " have you any idyah in the world what Handback is up to , making such an offer ? " " Well , " said the jailer , " I think he is really afraid of a personal damage suit . I imagine he has been to see a lawyer , and the lawyer put the fear of God in his heart . " " You believe the offer 's on the square ? " " Oh , yeh , " nodded the jailer ; " he 's in as big a lather to take you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to call ever'thing off . " Miltiades walked to the door and down the steps with the jailer . " Maybe I ought n't to sign after all , " he said half to himself and half to Frierson . J. Handback himself was in the office of the jail . AsMiltiades started out , he held up a paper and called out : " Did you agree to sign this document , Colonel Vaiden ? " " What 's in it ? " asked the Colonel . " You agree to hold us free from all personal damages . Sandusky said you had agreed to sign it . " " Yes , that was what I agreed to , " said the Colonel . " Well , that 's what we want , " said Handback . The two principals sat down at a desk in the office and with evident distrust of each other signed their respective papers . The jailer took each paper after it was subscribed and filed it away in a small iron box , showing ostentatiously that it did not fall untimely into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right here to hand you your paper when you come back with the coin , Colonel , " assured Frierson . The Colonel nodded , and then said casually : " By the way , Joe , could you let me have a pistol to drop in my pocket ? I do n't want to be walking around with ten thousand dollars in a crowd like we have to-day . " " Why , certainly , certainly , Colonel , " agreed the jailer . He went to the same iron box , drew out a six-shooter , broke it down to see that it was loaded , snapped it shut again , and handed it to Miltiades . The gesture was intended more for Handback than for anyone else . Miltiades dropped the weapon in his pocket , bade the group good-day . As he walked out on the street with his shoulders back Frierson said : " I declare , no matter what kind of scrape one of them Vaiden boys gets into , he acts just like a Vaiden ! " The back street on which the jail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less sober men steered more or less drunken companions into this back street to quiet them . On the other hand , drunken men dragged more or less sober men into the back street to give them a drink and enliven them . The thoroughfare was a sort of alcoholic clearing house where intoxicated men were added to and withdrawn from circulation . In a corner behind some barrels a small boy stood winkinghis eyes to keep from crying as he kept watch over a stupefied father . Further along two men were cursing and pummeling each other over a disagreement as to what majorityNew York would return for Cleveland . This yelling and fighting and swearing did not divert Colonel Vaiden 's mind from the astounding turn of fortune in the Handback matter . He glanced backwards now and then to see if he were being followed . He could not be sure , owing to the number of men in the street . An idea came to him to go and vote and lose himself completelyin the crowd around the polls . He walked through an alley that led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that flowed under the gnarled mulberries along Intelligence Row . A band was playing . A great picture of Cleveland was painted on a banner and stretched between two poles . The Florence Fencibles were on parade in the Square east of the courthouse . They had a cannon to fire when they heard the returns that Cleveland really was elected . A number of exConfederatesoldiers had put on their old uniforms and had come to town to vote for Cleveland . The polling place was in the west room of the courthouse . Everywhere in the crowd , on the courthouse steps , in the polling booths , men were distributing Democratic ballots to prospective voters . These politicians questioned everyone as to whether he had voted or not . " Use this for gun wadding to blow hell out of the Republicans , " they would say as they thrust a ballot into the voter 's hand . On the table , where the election judges sat , was a pile of Republican ballots . Landers had put them there . The postmasterstood near the ballot box watching his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . At long intervalsa white man from the hills would edge in toward Landers , consult with him . The postmaster would get a Republican ballot and give to the man . The hill voter usually accepted Landers ' word for the kind of ballot he was voting . He seldom knew how to read . As Miltiades came up to the table the judges were questioninga young white boy . " Have you paid any poll tax ? " queried one of the officials . " No , I came twenty-one since the poll tax fell due , " said the youth doggedly . " Where do you live ? " " In East Florence . " " What 's your name ? " " Toussaint Vaiden . " From the crowd the voice of another boy called out : " He 's a nigger . " P249The spokesman of the judges straightened in his chair . " No , you ca n't vote , " and he waved the boy away . Landers protested : " Why ca n't he vote ? " " You know damn well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the grandfather of this boy was not a free man . " " How would that boy have blue eyes and light hair if hisgrandfather was n't a free man ? " demanded Landers . " Who was your father ? " asked the judge of the octoroon . Toussaint stood in the center of the crowd with a painful compression of anger and shame in his chest and throat . He never thought about who his father had been . He took endlessprecautions never to let that theme linger in his mind . The gentleness , the sweetness , the refinement of his mother had built such mental bulwarks against the question that it could not be thought . Now , to have it flung in his face in this contemptuous place ! " Well , if you ca n't answer , " snapped the spokesman . He lifted his voice : " Does anybody here know anything about Toussaint Vaiden ? " He caught sight of Miltiades and called to him : " Colonel Vaiden , do you know anything about this boy ? " " What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miltiades . " He says his mother 's name is Gracie Vaiden . Do you know him ? " " His mother was my father 's house servant , " said the Colonel , looking at Toussaint . " Do you know who the boy 's father was ? " Miltiades pondered a moment and then said : " His mother was married to a negro named Solomon . " " Was Solomon a free man ? " " No , my father-in-law , Mr. Alex BeShears , owned Solomonand I think sold him to a nigger dealer soon after the war broke out . "   " There you are , " said the judge to Toussaint : " your father was not a free man , so you ca n't vote . " Landers interrupted : " What color was this negro Solomon you 're talking about ? " he asked Miltiades . " Why , as I remember Solomon , a light chocolate . " " Then look at this boy , " protested the postmaster , shakinga finger at Toussaint . " How would it be possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ashton , who was standing near by , lifted a courteous voice . " Now , Mr. Landers , sir , the law of Alabama supposes that the child of a mother is the offspring of her husband . In a case like this the rule becomes what is known in courts as a legal fiction , sir  --  but it holds . "  |p251JUDGE  ASHTON 'S jest concerning Toussaint 's paternity lingered in the ears of the crowd for an amused moment ; then Colonel Miltiades Vaiden forgot it because he was full of more important affairs . The Colonel cast his own ballot , got himself out of the election crowd as inconspicuously as possible , and pursued his way along the deserted road to Gracie 's cottage in East Florence . As he walked he wondered if he would possibly have any trouble getting the money back from Gracie . The mere thought of a Vaiden negro failing to safeguard his spoil , or failing to return it when he was ready for it , filled the Colonel with a kind of anticipatory grimness . His very freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered what he would do to a Vaiden nigger woman if she should spoil the sudden and miraculous fortune which had befallen him ? He did not think he would shoot her . Shooting would be too painless . He clenched his fists as he walked along , and then put the whole idea to one side as absurd . Of course Gracie would no , ' betray him . The peculiar half-chanting wail of negro voices caught his ears . He was passing Miss Tony 's house with its foolish gate posted like a sentinel in front of the rickety door. " 0 Lawd , " came a black woman 's voice , " don ' let him ! " " Don ' let him ! " came a chanting response on a higher key . " Don ' let Mas ' Clebelan ' be ' lected an ' tu'n yo ' chillun back into slabes once mo ' . " " 0 Lawd , spa ' yo ' people dem scorpeen whups ! "   " Don ' let him , Lawd , don ' let him ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chanting simultaneously : " We knows hit 's wrong to lie an ' steal . " " Men runs aftah women , an ' us women ' lows hit . " " Gib us one mo ' chanst , Lawd , to se 've you bettah . Don ' let Mas ' Clebelan ' git ' lected ! " The logical terror of the black folk that if a Republican President set them free , a Democratic President would cast them into chains again was lost on Miltiades . To him they were a cabinful of fool niggers mouthing their nigger prayers . He hurried on toward the neat white cottage of the quadroon a mile beyond . Gracie 's cottage was deserted . The white man knocked at the door , then entered , going directly to the kitchen , where the valise was concealed . When he entered the kitchen he saw some boards laid on the top of the kitchen stove , and the cover of the manhole in the ceiling was gone , leaving a square black aperture . A kind of coldness went over Miltiades at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Handbacks had got his money . They had caught on somehow . . the direction he had taken from town . . . they had wormed the secret out of Gracie . . . . As the Colonel stared at the hole in the ceiling a homicidal wrath rose up against the colored woman . He tingled to do some terrible violence to her . For a Vaiden nigger . . . one his own family had raised . . . the Colonel reached in his pocket and fingered Frierson 's revolver . He turned , walked back up the hallway , and opened the woman 's bedroom door . A dress thrown across the foot of the bed suggested that Gracie had left the cottage hastily . The Colonel looked at the dress intently . He decided she would come back . He went back to the kitchen again , studied the aperture , then suddenly climbed up on the stove and felt into the dark loft . His hand touched the valise . He gripped thep253leather corner and almost fell off the stove . He pulled the case to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violently that it almost fell out of his hands . He caught it against his chest , with the boards on the stove teetering under his feet . Then he saw that the valise had been opened and one of the packages broken into . When the Colonel saw this a queer change came into the quality of his wrath . The broken package was Gracie 's own theft . It was a nigger 's trick to take a little out of much , to pilfer a dollar or two , to commit beggarly thefts . The Colonel got off the stove , put the valise on the table and began examining the torn package . It had a bill or two left in it . There had been five hundred-dollar packages and thousand-dollar packages in the container . At the very least Gracie had taken something near five hundred dollars . This increase in the quadroon 's theft worked another turn in Miltiades ' complicated fury . " God damn such a wench ! " he shivered , " running off with hundreds of dollars . . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through his nerves like the plucking of violin strings . He closed his hand over Frierson 's pistol . He did not know whether or not he would use it . He ought to beat her with a stick of her own stove wood . He took a step backward so he could look through the kitchen door into the hall . Gracie was just entering her room when she saw Miltiades in the kitchen . She gave a little cry and stood looking at him . The man moistened his lips . " You have taken some of my money , " he said in a monotone . The quadroon nodded with a strange heartbroken expression in her face . " Y-yes , sir . . . th-three hundred dollars , " she said unsteadily . " What did you take it for ? " trembled the Colonel . " For  --  for Miss Ponny , Colonel Milt , " breathed the woman.  | " Ponny ! Ponny ! What did Ponny want with three . . . " " Oh , Mas ' Milt ! " gasped Gracie , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her and her little baby . . . . " And the quadroon began weeping , with a faint gaspingsound , battling against her emotions like a white woman . P255I N THE shabbily built boom house on Cherry Street the two front windows were alight . This double lighting silently reaffirmed to Miltiades the tragedy of which Gracie , the quadroon , already had informed him . The house where Ponny and her baby were laid out for burial was , paradoxically , more astir with life than Miltiades had ever known it . The living room on the right-hand side seemed to be full of people . The company room on the left was lighted but appeared unoccupied . But as Miltiades moved up the dark walk to his door he saw through the window , lying on the bed of the company room , a great bulk covered with a sheet . As the Colonel entered the hallway , Rose Vaiden , his sister-in-law , opened the door of the living room . She looked at him for a moment and then said in a monotone which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miltiades ? " " Yes . " " She 's in there . " A kind of wrench of emotion went through the viscera of Miltiades . He opened the door and went into the company room . Two or three of the visitors came to the door of the living room and silently watched him enter . The Colonel closed the door behind him . What moved Miltiades most painfully of all was the completestillness of the great sheeted figure on the bed . Ponny always had slept restlessly , but here was not the faintest suggestion of motion . Her heavy movements had ended . As he stood looking at her body he recalled how she had wanted to go with him to the speaking in Courthouse Square ,  |p256and  how he had put her off and had gone away without her . Now the dead woman reproached him for his lifelong neglect and the faint shame which he always had felt for her . It had almost emptied her life of pleasures . The Colonel thought now , with useless self-reproach , that lie need not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . After a space he turned and went back into the hallway . Rose was still there . She asked , " Have you had your supper ? " When the Colonel said no , she directed that he would find some on the table . She stood a little out of the doorway for him to pass . In the living room there were several persons : Mrs. Ashton , who had brought Rose to Cherry Street in her buggy ; Mrs. Klem with three of her children ; two more neighbor women , and young Jerry Catlin . As Miltiades walked through the room Mrs. Ashton said in a formal voice : " Colonel Vaiden , I want to extend my sympathy to you in your bereavement . " The Colonel thanked her and went on into the kitchen . He sat down at the table feeling the disapproval and condemnationin all of his visitors . Condemnation of his theft , and . shock that Ponny should have ( lied while he was in jail , affected the voices and manner of all the women . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at him . It sounded in Jerry 's voice when he said , " Good-evening , Uncle Milt . " The table before him was loaded with food , cold boiled ham , cold fried chicken , corn bread , light bread , cold turnip greens , jams , pickles , sweet milk and butter milk , two kinds of fruit pies with strips of brown crust crisscrossed for tops . A pot of coffee simmered on the stove . The neighbors had brought most of this in to make a solemn feast for the watchers who sat up with Ponny through the night . Mrs. Klem was transported to find herself on an ephemeral equality with Mrs. Ashton and Mrs. Rose . She talked excit/edly , telling these great ladies what had happened while they were interested in her story . " I jest felt something was wrong , " she continued , " when I saw the sheriff and Mr. Handback coming away from Miss Ponny 's . . . . " " Yes , yes , naturally , " agreed Mrs. Ashton , frowning slightly at Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miltiades had entered the house . " So , thinks I , " proceeded Mrs. Klem , " I 'll jest step over and see what 's happened to Miss Ponny , and over I goes . And there she was . . . . Law , Miss Ashton , you 'll never know how she looked , there on the floor , caught in . . . " Mrs. Klem paused significantly , shaking her head . After a moment she added , " And it was all brought on by that stinkingsheriff and that hawg of a Handback tumbling ever ' - thing in her house upside down and digging in her yard looking for the money . " " Mrs. Klem , " ejaculated Mrs. Ashton , in exquisite discomfort , " have you got a long-handled broom in your house to sweep cobwebs ? . . . Would you mind going and getting it for me ? " " Why , nome . . . not at all ! " cried Mrs. Klem , filled with delight to be able to do something to accommodate Mrs. Ashton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and she whirled one of her little girls off after the broom . Mrs. Rose went into the kitchen to wait on Miltiades while he ate , and also to strengthen her silent condemnation of the Colonel by being near to him . Rose had convicted Miltiades of wife murder . If Miltiades had not stolen the cotton the sheriff would never have frightened poor Ponny into a miscarriage with his search warrants . Rose had talked this steadily all the way from her boarding house to Ponny 's home . Her brother-in-law was so repulsive to her that she could hardly endure to watch him eat at the table . She knew that he had never loved Ponny . Now he had done this to her . As Rose poured and handed Miltiades a glass of milk shep258could endure it no longer . She turned abruptly , went into the living room , and said to Mrs. Ashton : " Susie , go attend to him . . . I 'm sick . " Mrs. Ashton felt equivocally about Miltiades . She felt the Colonel had gone about collecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and got himself in jail . That incarceration changed him for her from a gentleman into a man who had been in jail . She went into the kitchen thinking , not without a touch of ghastly humor , that here was she , Susan Ashton , wife of Judge Ashton , serving supper to a jailbird ! Presently , to prove to Miltiades that she was not thinking about his having been in jail , she said to him : Augustus has telegraphed everybody : Mr. Sylvester in Arkansas , your other brother in Louisiana , Marcia up in Tennessee , and he sent word to Miss Cassandra by a nigger . . . . I imagine he 'll get some replies in the morning as to who is coming . . . . It 's a good thing the weather is as cold as it is . " This last phrase had reference to the keeping of Ponny 's body for two or three days . " Did anybody send word to Mr. BeShears ? " asked Miltiades . " Why , no-o . . . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned voice , as if the oversight were her own . " Well , there 's plenty of time for that , " said Miltiades ; " they live down at the Crossroads . " For a space Miltiades ate in silence . The greater portion of his thought was a cold , conscious disregard for what the women about him were thinking . He asked himself silently , what difference did it make to him what the women thought ? The thoughts of the women were so childish and unperceiving . He had had no concern with Ponny 's death . It had been brought about by circumstances over which he had no control.  |p259Then  , as he sat there , a queer thought came to Miltiades . It was Ponny , whom years ago he had married for her money , who at last , with her life , had countersigned his title to the fortune he now possessed . This bizarre fact , once it had come upon him , held his mind with a sort of fascination . Ponny 's death really had rescued him from jail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a fortune . Because what chance would Handback have in any suit after he had done Ponny to death in his mal-use of the sheriff and the search warrant ? At this turn of his thoughts Miltiades ' wrath began to rise against the merchant . He wished he had been at home when Mayhew and Handback were frightening his sick and pregnant wife ! It was an outrageous misuse of official power ! A prospective mother : to come turning able to tell ! The full cruelties enacted against Ponny grew upon the Colonel . No wonder they kept him locked up in jail without bond or bondsmen ! No wonder when Ponny was dying they had come flying back to the jail and had compromised on ten thousand dollars and no criminal actions on either side ! The Colonel had known of Ponny 's death when he returned with the money . When he had paid Frierson he had cursed the Handbacks for damned unscrupulous murderers , and he had said to the jailer that , as far as his liberty was concerned , he need not pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he had said he would , because the word of a Vaiden was as good as another man 's bond ! Then he had sent a negro to ask a bank to take the remainder of the money in their back door , it being election day . Later he had walked openly up Market Street with the return of his old debt and had deposited it . But the money , the compromise money which he had left with Frierson to be paid to the Handbacks , he felt had been tricked from him . It was their damned slippery double dealingagain !   In the midst of the Colonel 's silent wrath Mrs. K1em entered the kitchen . The woman paused beside his chair and said in a low tone : " Colonel Milt , I do n't think there 's going to be a place for you to sleep here . The comp'ny room 's occupied , and the setter-ups will have to be in the fam'ly room by the far . If you want us to , we 'll move yore bed in the hall . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked blankly at Mrs. Klem , then glanced around the kitchen as if choosing a place . " That would be too much trouble , to move the bed in the hall . " " Why , no , it would n't be no trouble . . . . Miss Rose said you could come down to her house , " proceeded the neighbor woman , " and you 're more than welcome to our house , Colonel . Jeff likes you . He says you 're not stuck up . . . it 's jest a few steps down there . . . . " Here Mrs. Klem 's sallow face trembled , tears filled her eyes . " I  --  I know you 're goin ' to miss Miss Ponny , " she gasped . " We all are , Colonel Milt . . . . " The neighbor woman 's grief suddenly invaded Miltiades . He compressed his lips , swallowed at a pain in the back of his throat . When he could speak with evenness he said : " I believe I 'll go down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He realized , by this second-hand invitation Rose had sent to him through Mrs. Klem , how his sister-in-law loathed him , how she could not bring herself even to ask him to his brother 's home to sleep . P261AT INTERVALS , all night long , the funeral watchers in the tenement on Cherry Street heard the boom of the cannon of the Florence Fencibles . The women who sat up with Ponny in the fore part of the night would glance at each other and talk in low tones of the election , but they did not forget they were sitting up with the dead . Now and then one of them would say to Jerry. : " Had n't you better look in the company room to see if everything is all right ? " The boy would move , half awake , and look into the room of the dead , and then come back and try to sleep in his chair . He was to be a watcher in the latter part of the night . When the women went home he would go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booming of the cannon , and a feelingof some indefinite evil filled Jerry 's brain . Now and then he really did drift into unconsciousness . At twelve o'clock the women aroused Jerry again , and everybody went out to eat a midnight snack . The women had been looking forward to this repast for hours and ate with good appetites . But it was a solemn eating . The watchers felt the presence of the dead woman in the company room , and the food had a funereal flavor . After their meal the women put on their shawls and went home . Mrs. Klem told Jerry she would send Mr. Klem over to sit up for the rest of the night , and for Jerry to drink two cups of coffee to keep him from going to sleep . The boy did this and presently became intensely awake . His aroused and rather awed mind began to think of his aunt Ponny . Her death struck him not with grief , because he had seen her only a few times , and then her flesh had rather shocked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ niggah whut kep ' Mist ' Lucius f'um shootin ' Coll Milt in de sto ' de oddah day . . . .

" The youth was annoyed that a negro should have the impudenceto come around begging for his aunt 's funeral snack . He thought sharply to himself : " They 'll do anything in the world to get a white person 's sympathy and take advantage of it . " Aloud he was saying : " No , Loob , it 's not mine . I ca n't give any of it away . I am just one of the watchers here , waiting for day to come . " P264OF ALL the Vaidens to whom Augustus sent telegrams announcingPonny 's death , only Marcia Catlin , Jerry 's mother , returned an answer . She would reach Florence , the reply said , on the following morning . Jerry looked forward to his mother 's coming with a certainapprehension . He felt his stay in Florence had wrought changes in him which his mother might not recognize . But when she arrived , early the second morning after his aunt Ponny 's death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a livery-stable hack , his anxiety vanished . He submitted to her kiss and did not understand the nervous pressure of her arms around him as she prayed for a secondthat her son would never succumb to the temptation of theft as had her brother Miltiades . Marcia stayed with Augustus and Rose . When the neighborsheard that Mrs. Catlin was at Rose 's hone they came before the hour set for the funeral to see her : the Ashtons , the Crowninshields , Mrs. Bradley , other persons who scarcely knew her but had heard of her . Among them Mrs. Frierson , the jailer 's wife , came to see the visitor . She introduced herselfand said she had seen Marcia once before the war at the Lacefield manor , and when she heard Miss Marcia was in town she felt like she just had to see her again . She said she was Eliza Ham 's niece . Mrs. Catlin held the woman 's hand and said : " Well . . . well . . . well . . . and you are Eliza 's niece . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mother ? " " Mary . " " Where is Eliza now ? "  | Mrs. Frierson said her aunt was living in Lenstock , Texas . When Eliza and her husband were on their way to Texas from Alabama they had stopped overnight at Bay Minette , Louisiana , and had stayed with Marcia 's elder brother Lycurgus Vaiden . Marcia said : " Just think of that , she saw Lycurgus . " During Marcia 's girlhood Eliza Ham had meant almost nothing to her . Mrs. Frierson she ( lid not remember at all , but now she was moved to see any human being who had lived in that vanishing glory that surrounded her girlhood days . Drusilla Crowninshield Marcia never really had liked , but now the old rivalry and the faint intellectual contempt which Marcia had felt for the daughter of the Lacefield manor had passed away . For the first time in her life Marcia was reconciled to Drusilla for breaking her betrothal to Miltiades and eloping with Major Crowninshield . Marcia now supposed that even back in those days Drusilla had divined that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if Drusilla had married her brother the theft he had committed would have been impossible . Mrs. Catlin let the whole painful episode slip into forgiveness and forgetfulness . She said in a low voice , looking at Sydna : " Your daughter is almost as pretty as you were , Drusilla , when you were a girl . " And Drusilla turned and looked curiously at Sydna , reviewingthrough Marcia 's eyes her own past loveliness . A cream-colored woman carne to the door of the boarding house and stood just outside the threshold , looking at Marcia . Finally , in a lull in the talk of the white women , Rose said : " Marcia , do you know who this is ? " Mrs. Catlin looked at the quadroon 's face for upward of half a minute and finally asked : " Is that you , Gracie ? " And Gracie 's dark , wrinkled eyes suddenly filled with tears , and she said in a low tone :  | " Yes , Li'l ' Miss , this is Gracie . How are you getting along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Very well , Gracie . . . . Well , I declare , Gracie . . I 'm glad to see you , Gracie . " " And I 'm glad to see you , Li'l ' Miss . " Here Mrs. Catlin 's talk went back to the white women , but Gracie , standing at the door , clung uncomfortably in the ex-mistress 's mind . It made her think of her dead brother Polycarp , by whom , she had always believed , Gracie had borne her child . Now the thought of Polycarp 's misconductand Miltiades ' theft filled Mrs. Catlin with anxiety for her own son . She could not imagine where such a heritage had entered her family . It was now ten o'clock , the hour set when the whole group would go to Miltiades ' home on Cherry Street for Ponny 's funeral services . Just before they started , Rose drew Marcia aside and whispered : " We have a back seat for Gracie , if you want her to come along . " But Marcia , filled with the disturbance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned with the others for the door . A little later , when the group of the white Vaidens and their friends drove away in two buggies and the hack , the cream-colored woman stood at the gate and watched them out of sight . In the house on Cherry Street Marcia met her brother Miltiades . She was so moved at the thought of his dishonesty , the color , faded from her face and left visible the fine grains of chalk upon her cheeks . She could scarcely speak to him . She quavered , " Miltiades . . . Pm so sorry for you . . . " and began weeping . She felt as if her brother had put himself into some faroffregion where neither she nor any of the family could ever come near him again . That her chivalrous brother could have stolen ! That Colonel Miltiades Vaiden , a gallant officer during the war , a leader of men during the tragic days of the Reconstruction , the one member of her family of whom she always had been proud , that brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Marcia 's tears the other women in the house began weeping . The Christian minister with his broad face and smacking lips stood in the bare company room and spoke in Ponny 's funeral . He described the rich rewards of a Christian life , extolling the patience , the charity , the faith and loving-kindness of the dead woman who lay in her coffin at the end of her empty existence . The interment of Ponny was to take place at the family burial ground on the old Vaiden plantation . The minister and friends remained in Florence ; only the family undertookthe long drive of sixteen miles over a rough road . The black hearse and the hack , in order to return to Florencethat day , were forced to break into an indecent trotting and bumping over the less rough stretches of the road . On the way to the old homestead , the cortege stopped at the Crossroads and picked up old Mr. BeShears . A half hour later , in the early afternoon , they reached their destination . The sight of her sister Cassandra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruinous log house to meet them filled Marcia with desolation . It made the whole gay , brave past of their family unbelievable . The part which she , her very self , had lived broke away from reality and became a legend lingering over the house and the fields , as remote as the mound builders . Buck Mosely and some negroes from the Crossroads already had dug the grave . These black men tugged and sweated and lowered the great coffin into its resting place among the slim pines growing on the hillock . As the negroes refilled the grave and rounded the raw red mound the family stood watching in silence . Old man BeShears , balanced on his injured feet , looked at an ancient stone which bore the half obliterated epitaph :  | POLYCARP VAIDENSON OF JAMES AND LAURA VAIDENBORN 1845 . DIED 1865 . A BRAVE SOLDIER , A LOVING SON , A GENTLEMAN OF HONOR . DIED TAKING ALMS TO THE NEEDY . It happened , through the undirected digging of the negroes , that Ponny was buried beside him . P270THREE days after Ponny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her friends made a second call on the visitor to express a hope that they would see her again sometime , but Marcia did not know . It was such a long way from her home in Tennessee to Florence . . . nearly fifty miles . . . and the roads were so bad . . . . " You 'll have to come back and see Jerry graduate , " they suggested . But in her heart Marcia did not think she would . If Miltiadesor Augustus or Rose should die , then she would make the long trip back again to attend their funerals , but outside of some family calamity she did not believe she would see friends and kinsfolk again . These old friends regretted Marcia 's going . In her presencethey lived again in the glamour of their youth . She was like a chemical that brought out the romantic record of their past on the palimpsest of their double lives in the old South and the new . The only person in Florence really gratified to see Marcia start back to Tennessee was her son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner worlds . In the same boarding house with his mother lie could not go on with his exercises in saintliness ; he could not debate with Sandusky concerning men and God and things . He could not even think comfortably about Sydna Crowninshield under his mother 's eyes . However , Jerry did not realize these handicaps . He did not know that he wanted her to go . He sincerely supposed that he was delighted that his mother had come to visit him . He bought her a cheap box of candy downtown which costP271him his spending money for a week . He purchased tickets to a negro minstrel and then sat through it on needles and pins over obscene jokes at which he would have roared had his mother not been along . He even took a walk with her one crisp afternoon , and was keenly embarrassed because Sydna Crowninshield called good-day to him from her yard . When Marcia finally started home , Jerry rode seven miles with her in the hack , then kissed her good-bye with tears in his eyes and walked back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had never seen a mother and a son so congenial and so devoted to each other . Jerry was almost as much pleased at this reportas he was that his mother finally had gone home and left him , once more , to his own devices . He walked the seven miles back to Florence with tears in his eyes and treading on air . The departure of Marcia acted on the Augustus Vaiden family like the dying out of an opiate , and all those small bitternesses which go to make up life in any well regulated establishment broke out afresh . When Jerry got back from his long , filial walk , he found his uncle Augustus fretting to go to town . Rose would not let him , because she thought it was too chilly . " I want to walk down there and lay the law down to A. Gray Lacefield , " declared Augustus in a dudgeon . " I want him to know what 'll happen if he publishes a word about that ! " " Why , he would n't think of publishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course he will ! " cried Augustus , " unless somebody lays the law down to him . " " Well , you ca n't go down there on a cold day like this . . . . " She pondered a moment , then : " Write a note and send it by Jerry . The bitter weather would give you the la grippe . " Augustus grumbled at this deputing of his authority , but finally got up from the kitchen table to hunt a pencil andP272paper . He had to search clear up in Sandusky 's room before he found any . He brought these back to the kitchen table and wrote a fierce note : MR . A. GRAY LACEFIELD , Editor Florence Index , SIR : If you print any reference to my brother Miltiades Vaiden in your filthy scandalmongering sheet you will have me personally to settle with . Yours , AUGUSTUS VAIDEN . Rose took the note , read it , nodded to Jerry to follow her , and walked out into the hall . " Jerry , " she said , tearing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask Mr. Lacefield not to mentionanything about your uncle Miltiades in his paper . " Tears formed in Rose 's eyes . " It 's important , Jerry . It  --  it 'll just ruin the family . Already your uncle Augustus has had to give up the position he was offered at the Barham Furniture Store . It 's just ruined Augustus ' business career . " She blinked the moisture out of her eyes and controlled herself . " Tell Mr. Lacefield your mother came to Ponny 's funeral , and all her old friends enjoyed her visit greatly . That will be something for hint to print . " Jerry received this commission with a sense of importance . He walked down to the Index office and told the editor what his aunt Rose had asked . A. Gray Lacefield was a smallish man with the whitened face and rather overbright eyes of a printer . Now he called his devil and went with Jerry to the forms that were already put to bed . " Listen to this , " he said appealingly to Jerry , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " and he read from the reversed type : " Last week our old friend and fellow townsman , Colonel Miltiades Vaiden , made an overnight business visit to Mr.P273Joe Frierson , our esteemed manager of Lauderdale County 's detention department . ' What 's the matter with that ? " Jerry was sharply embarrassed to be asked to sit in judgmenton the article , but he faced the situation and said honestly : " Mr. Lacefield , everybody will know what you mean . " The editor drew a long breath . He was as unhappy over the matter as Jerry . " Dad brim it ! My duty to my subscribers . . . the whole truth , nothing but the truth , let the chips fall where they may . . . . " He bent over and read the type again . " Everybodyknows it , anyway , " he argued , " if I print something that is public knowledge , who does it hurt ? " " Why , Aunt Rose and Uncle Augustus and my mother , " said Jerry . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lacefield 's sweetheart during his youth . That young man had spent his attractive years trying to persuade her to marry him , but at last she had married Jerry 's father . So the editor looked at the type a little longer , took his mallet , knocked the quoins loose , and neatly extracted the offendingparagraph with his rule . He set it aside in a galley , then went to a case and set up in bold-faced capitals , WATCH THIS SPACE NEXT WEEKFOR IMPORTANT NEWSHe locked this in and started to work at his Washington hand press . The embarrassment of quashing the newspaper article was not the only spiritual tax levied against Jerry Catlin on account of his uncle Miltiades ' peculation . A reception was given to the sophomore class , and Jerry received an in. ' vitation . When he cast about for a girl in his class to go with him , he discovered that they all had escorts . This did not greatly distress him . In fact , it was a mildP274relief , because he never got on very well with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he always felt a faint uneasinessat a public reception lest he say or do the wrong thing . However , the fact that he could not get any girl at all with whom to undergo the thin penetrating unpleasantness of a social function caused Jerry to mention it to Sandusky that afternoon . The boarder immediately became virulent . He inquired acridly : " What difference does it make whether them little stuckupsophomore girls go with you or not ? " " Well , " said Jerry , " it 's improving . It learns you how to act . " " I say , the less you have to do with such people the better off you are ! They 're stuck-up because they were born here in Florence . . . always colluging together like they was God'lmighty 's little nieces . " Jerry refrained from smiling . He knew , as did everyone else in college , that Sandusky had written a note to a sophomoregirl asking her to go to a picnic with him . It was a very formal note , which he bad copied straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invitation became its recipient 's prize possession . She showed it to all of her girl friends and to some of the women teachers . When Sandusky found this out he was furious . For two or three days he spent his spare time in Governor O'Shawn 's law office trying to find out if he could recover the letter by means of a replevin suit . When he could find no precedent for this he contemplated a suit for slander . Now Sandusky shook his head at Jerry : " Stuck up and treacherous as snakes , " he added . " They 've always treated me fair enough , " defended Jerry mildly . Sandusky sat straighter at his table . " Oh , you think so , do you ? " " Why , sure , " said Jerry a little surprised . " Then I 'll tell you why all them girls had beaux to goP275to the reception . It 's this : All the other boys ' invitations had girls ' names in ' em already . They did n't have to ask no-body . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " No . . . none of the girls wanted their names in your invite , " explained the boarder maliciously . Jerry stared at Sandusky . He thought of his uncle Miltiades . " Oh ! " he ejaculated in a changed tone . " I did n't know that . " When the boarder saw the damage he had wrought , he tried to mend it . " Do n't pay no attention to the ignorance of a lot of fatheadedFlorence girls . They 've got ever'thing wrong , anyway . In the first place , your uncle Milt did n't steal that cotton , he was just collecting an old debt , he 's got a paper that 'll show it . In the next place , if he had ' a ' stole it , there 's no jestice in holding it aginst you . But it 's all fam'ly with these Florence folks . They do n't think about nothin ' but fam'ly . " " Is that really why they left any girl 's card out of my envelope ? " queried the youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like I was telling you . " Jerry sat staring at a mismatched place in the dingy flowered wall paper in their room . " I wonder how long this will last ? " " Why , I imagine four or five years after you are dead will see you through . " Jerry considered this a stroke of wit and laughed a little . " Well , I do n't know that it will make any particular differencewith me , " he said at length . " I do n't really like to go with ' em , anyway . " " Same here , " echoed Sandusky . " Still , I do consider it improving . " " Improving for what ? " " It makes you feel at ease when you are with ' em . " " Why , hell , if you ai n't never going with ' em , what dif- ference does it make whether you 'd feel at ease or not ? You see that just cancels itself out . " " That 's so , too , " admitted Jerry gravely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare upper room . A tiny stove , shaped like an hourglass , suddenly ceased to make a small roar , and Sandusky knew it was out . The little stove went out very easily , but it made amends by being very difficult to start . Sandusky looked around for some waste paper . " Girls are silly as geese , anyway , " continued Sandusky , rumpling up a sheet of newspaper . " Some of ' em make better grades than I do , " admitted Jerry . " Do you know why ? " demanded Sandusky sharply . " ' Cause they 're smarter , I guess , " opined the hobbledehoy . " No , it 's because they have feminine minds . I read about it in psychology just the other clay . A man 's mind does n't really work at anything except what it 's interested in . But a woman 's mind is just like a waste basket . It 'll hold anything you throw in it . Why ? Why , because it do n't make no diff'runce to girls . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway , and so they 'd jest as soon have them full of one kind of junk as another . And do you know what I thought to myself when I read that ? " " Have no idyah , " admitted Jerry . " Why , this . I said to myself , Sandusky , here you are in college , learning in college that you cai n't learn anything in college because most of what they teach here do n't apply to your mind . So college cancels itself out . All right , that bein ' the case , I 'm going to quit all this tomfoolery and get down to law which my mind can take in . I 'm going to pass the bar examinations as quick as I can and be a lawyer . ' " As Jerry was not really listening to this he did not follow it . " So I 'm quittin ' today , " concluded Sandusky ; " this is my last day . " P277The brooding boy came to his surroundings . " Last day of what ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm quitting collegetoday ! " " What are you goin ' to do ? " " Why , doggone it , I told you I was going to pass my bar examination and practise law . " Jerry looked at the boarder in amazement . The fellow 's quitting school gave the youth a sense of sacrilege . Jerry himself was doing nothing in college . He considered all his studies , taken separately , as unimportant , but he did believe that college in the abstract was the very foundation of any degree of enlightened existence , and the only hope of success in life . The fact that most of the successful men he knew were not college men had no bearing on this belief . Now he stared at Sandusky as if the fellow were committing economicsuicide . " You are still writing at your lessons , " he pointed out weakly . " No , I 'm not , " denied the boarder , " this is something about the law , " and he folded what he had written and stuck it in his pocket . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Jerry tentatively . " I am till I pass the bar examination and get into a good practice , " said Sandusky . " Then we can look forward to the pleasure of your company for quite a while , " suggested Jerry . " I do n't know whether you can or not , " said Sandusky stiffly . He took an envelope out of his drawer , addressed it , and placed whatever he had written inside of it . Then he got up and looked around for his hat , evidently about to go somewhere . Jerry came to life at once . He jumped up and went scuttlingdownstairs . He found his aunt Rose and his uncle Augustus in the kitchen and excitedly told them that San- dusky was quitting college . The two asked a few swift questions and found out that Jerry did not know why the boarder was quitting . Immediately both husband and wife hurried into the hallway to head off Sandusky . They waited about a minute when he appeared on the steps . Augustus cleared his throat . " Er  --  Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me you  --  er  --  you are thinking of quitting college ? " " I 'm not thinking of quitting , " said Sandusky , " I 've quit . " " Well , now . . . look here , Mr. Sandusky . . . " " Mr. Sandusky , " interrupted Rose swiftly , " if it 's because you have n't got enough money to put yourself through college , you can stay on here and pay half board , or not pay any board at all  --  whichever is the most convenient . " Sandusky was amazed at such a proposal . " Why , no-no , " he said blankly , " it is n't because I have n't got the money , Miss Rose ; I  --  I come here with two hund'erd dollars like the catalogue said . . . and I 've still got it . " " Then  --  what 's the matter ? " asked Mrs. Rose , bewildered . " Well , " said Sandusky judicially , " I jest do n't feel like I 'm getting anything out of college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why , you study , do n't you , Mr. Sandusky ? " " Yes , but looky here , what diff'runce will it ever make to me whether my tarsal bones are in my shins or my wrists ? " " You break one of them and you 'll find out , " put in Augustus , who did not know where they were himself . " Well , I hope I do n't break anything , " said Sandusky , " but if I do , I 'd be a whole lot more likely to get well of a sprained ankle than if I had a ruptured carpal or tarsal , or whatever it is down there . That 's my way of thinking . " " We see you are a very ungrateful young man , " said Mrs. Rose warmly . Sandusky went on out the door thinking stiffly of the insultthey had put upon him to think he had no money . Augustus , Mrs. Rose , and Jerry went back into theP279kitchen full of wrath at the obstinacy , induracy , and pigheadednessof Sandusky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education when they could get it that you find later in life hoeing cotton and plowing corn like a nigger in the field , " said Mrs. Rose , quite piqued that Sandusky had not needed her charity .   SANDUSKY proceeded toward town filled with ironic contempt for the slur the Vaidens had put upon him by consideringthat he was poverty stricken . On the contrary , he was rich , or at least he was potentially rich . Indeed , his decision to quit college was based on the fact that within the last few days he had made a great deal of money at his profession , and it stood to reason he would make a great deal more . Why , he would make more , he supposed , in the run of a year than the president of the collegehimself ! The envelope in his pocket proved that . Here Sandusky reached into his pocket , touched the talismanicenvelope , and was doubly fortified . At the cross street that turned into Pine , Sandusky paused , looked about him for a moment , then turned right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he moved in silence townward along its mould of leaves . As he drew near the Crowninshield home he glimpsed across the old fence a girl with bright blonde hair in a blue and yellow morning dress . She was gathering chrysanthemumswhich ran in all gradations from pinkish white to reddish black . Sandusky had no idea what this major chord of red did to the unfinished cadence of yellow and blue , but it had its effect on him , nevertheless . He supposed the charm of the ensemble belonged wholly to Sydna , and he felt this charm was something he could possess and touch and use , like real estate or a pie . When he came within talking distance Sandusky began walking slowly , hoping the girl would glance around . As she did not , but continued cutting flowers , Sandusky stoppedp281completely , cleared his throat , and said with a sense of mental strain at trying to think up something to say : " Those are very pretty flowers you are picking , Miss Sydna . " The girl looked around with a faint start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very pretty , " and went on with her work . Sandusky moistened his lips . " Are  --  are they your favorite flowers ? " he asked emptily . " Why-y . . . no . " " Is  --  is red your favorite color ? " The girl looked around at him again . " No , " she said , a little surprised and amused at his persistence , and then , not to be too curt , she added , " It 's blue . " " Blue , " repeated Sandusky : staring at her as if this were a surprising color . " Do you . . . do you like poetry ? " " Why , no , not specially , " answered the girl in growing astonishment . The smallish man wished he had never started such a conversation , because , once under way , he could not stop it . " Uh  --  er  --  what is your favorite dish , Miss Sydna ? " he inquired next . The girl compressed a smile from her lips . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At this reply Sandusky became miffed . He felt himself laughed at . He thought to himself that Sydna was laughing at a very successful lawyer if she did but know it . He had half a mind to show her the envelope in his pocket . But he did not allow the girl to see that she had miffed him . He glanced at the sky as if he were drawing some deductionas to the time of day from the position of the sun . " Well , I guess I better be moseying along , " he said . " Good-bye , " said Sydna , biting her lips . Notwithstanding his affront , Sandusky moved away with obvious reluctance . After inching along the length of two panels of fencing he came to another halt . " I 'm stopping college , " he said.  | The girl looked at him in genuine surprise . " Do you go to college ? " " Why , sure , " said Sandusky , " I 've been going to school nearly three " Suddenly it dawned on Sandusky that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amused him . " I 'm Sandusky , " he said in a lighter voice ; " I 'm Miss Rose Vaiden'sboarder . " " Why , ye-es . . . ye-es . . . " ejaculated Sydna , rather disconcerted . " That 's all right , " agreed Sandusky readily ; " nobody hardly ever knows me . Folks I see over and over . . . it 's the dad-blamedest thing . " " I do n't see how anyone could forget you , " said Sydna . " Well , they do , but I figger they 're goin ' to remember me from now on . " " Why ? " inquired the girl , letting curiosity overcome her tact . " Because I 'm going in the legal business , " nodded Sandusky . He reached in his pocket , drew out the envelope , and stood fingering it and looking at it . " Is that why you are going to stop school ? " inquired Sydna . " That and the slights , " said Sandusky . The girl looked at him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , them college girls . They 're so biggoty . They would n't anymore stand here and talk to me in a nice way like you 're doing than they 'd fly . They 'd try to throw off on me . " Sandusky pulled clown his mouth . " I say let ' em throw off , it 's all the same to me . But now they 're starting in on Jerry the same way . And I ralely think that 's a shame . It 'll be worse on him than it was on me , because he has n't got the backbone I have . " Sydna laid down her flowers and approached the fence . " What Jerry are you talking about  --  Jerry Catlin ? " " Yes . " " What did anybody do to him ? " asked the girl intently.  | " Why , they slighted him at a party they 're giving . They did n't put anybody 's name in his envelope . He feels it even if he pertends like he do n't . " Sydna went on with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerry . " Why , the idea ! " she ejaculated ; " the idea of them treatinga nice boy like Jerry thattaway . . . . " " Oh , well , " said Sandusky loftily , " I 'm not supprised . You 'll find Florence girls treacherous as snakes , Miss Sydna . My motto is , do n't han'l ' tar , or you 'll get yourself black . So I let ' em alone . " Sandusky glanced at the sun again . " Well , I ralely have got to be moseying . "   " Old man Simpson 's lease on his drug store runs out next month . You offer me a little better figger , and I 'll go around to old Mrs. Wood and lease it from over Simpson 's head . . . he 's paying sixty . " " A month ! " ejaculated Miltiades . " If you could offer her sixty-five . . . " The Colonel hesitated . In the outlines of the business he hoped to establish , Miltiades thought in the expansive terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he considered in the light of the penurious years he had lived in Florence . " I 'll look around a little further before I settle on any-thing . " " Looky here , Colonel , " cried Bradley , jerking down his cigar and opening his smoked eye , " this is no time to put off leasing or buying . The minute Cleveland gets his seat , ever'thing in the South , rents , farms , produce , ever ' damn thing is going to jump sky high . " " That 's a fact , " agreed the Colonel , with a return of his impatience to buy . Sandusky interposed again . " Could I have half a second , Colonel ? " " Just a minute . . . . " Here another thought entered the Colonel 's head . He said to Bradley , " Farms , too ? " " Hell , yes . They 'll be a little behind other things , but the general advance will drag land up too . " " I was thinking of a farm , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two nigger fam'lies . Have you got anything like that ? " " Two fam'lies . . . " Bradley considered . " . . . Two . . . . Look here , Colonel , " began the real-estate man with tentative enthusiasm , " I 've got a six-nigger fam'ly plantationthat I can make you at such a figger you 'll swear you stole it . " Miltiades asked where it was . " Now , of course , " warned Bradley , " land values are goingto be a little slow in responding to the Cleveland Admin/istration . You ca n't turn this over at a profit inside of six months . " " All right , what plantation is it ? " pursued the Colonel , with interest . " Well , it 's the old Lacefield place , " said Bradley . An odd little feeling went through the Colonel . " Has Handback put that up for sale ? " " He told me yesterday he wanted to sell it . He priced it at fifteen thousand for a quick sale . " Miltiades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While he was clerking for Handback , he wished the merchantwell , but now that he had stolen from him he wished him all the evil that could befall him . " Offer him seven thousand five hundred dollars from me , " he directed . Bradley screwed up his smoked eye a little more tightly . " Do n't believe it would be the thing to mention your name , Colonel , " he said frankly , " and it would n't be worth while to mention that price , either . " The idea of owning the old Lacefield plantation flowed through the Colonel 's nerves with a subtle satisfaction . " What price would you mention to him ? " " Not less than twelve , five . I 'd be willing to try that on him and see if it was a fit . " " I have known that place , " said Miltiades musingly , " when a-hundred and fifty thousand would n't touch it . " " M-m . . . that 's not in this day and time . All right , looky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . and I wo n't tell him who it 's from . There 's no use doing that . I 'll say I 'm buying it myself and let the deed pass through me . " " Twelve , five , " repeated Miltiades . " Not that I need such a big place . I do n't . I 've only got a couple of nigger fam'lies to provide a place for . " The two men separated , repeating twelve , five , several times , after the fashion of men careful to have the price understood . Bradley moved off up the street in a straight line for Handback 's store .   cans of the pioneer stock , he assumed he could manage one if he had the chance . In the midst of his preoccupation about such a store he saw a thin young man in modish clothes , carrying a sample case . The Colonel angled across the street to overtake the salesman . When he was a few steps behind he called out : " Bivins ! Mr. Bivins , just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Colonel noticed that the fellow 's eyes were ringed a little more deeply than formerly from drinking , and his nose had developed a delicate spray of veins on its end . He stood batting his eyes at the Colonel . " What in the hell do you want ? " he queried in dislike for Miltiades . " Want to place an order with you , " explained the Colonel in equal short temper . " I 'm not down here selling goods , " said Bivins . " You 're not ! What are you doing ? " ejaculated the Colonel in astonishment . " Collecting . " " You working for your same company ? " " Sure . " " Would n't you sell something if you got an order ? " " From you ? " asked Bivins . " Yes , certainly , from me . " " How you going to pay ? " " Cash . " " You mean you 'll pay me the cash when you give me your order ? " " Certainly not , " snapped Miltiades , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as I could throw a bull by the tail . " " But I suppose you really have got the cash this time , " said Bivins , and he broke out laughing . Miltiades was suddenly enraged . " By God , if I had a gun I 'd blow your brains out , " he said in a fury , and he started back across the street . P291Bivins became more sensible . " Wait , hold on , " he said in a half apologetic tone , " I 'm here to sell goods , and you want to buy . I 'll ship anything you want to the railroad station with a bill of lading attached . Is that all right ? " " That would protect both of us from being swindled , " said Miltiades , turning back again . " All right , what do you want ? " The Colonel thought what he wanted . The set-up that struck him as an immediate necessity was provisions for the tenants he would probably put on the old Lacefield place . He began tentatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . hoes . . . plows . . . bacon . . . " " What grade of flour ? " " That yellow third-grade flour , Farm Wife 's Friend . ' " " I know what you 're starting , " said Bivins , looking at his purchaser out of his circled eyes ; " I can make out your order quicker than you can . You want the regular set-up for niggers on a plantation . Why not leave it to me and let me go ? I 've made out hundreds of orders just like yours . " " What you in such a rush about ? " asked the Colonel irritably . " I 'm on my way to a creditors ' meeting . " " Oh , you are . . . . " Miltiades fell in with Bivins and walked a little way in unfriendliness . " You 've picked a hell of a time to force some merchant to the wall ; just when business is about to open up . " " I think so myself , " agreed Bivins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cincinnati Republican . He says he 's going to mark time and see which way the cat jumps . " Miltiades pondered this a moment . " If enough firms start collecting and stop selling , the cat 'll jump the wrong way , " he said at last . " Yes , but the boss ca n't help it , " said the drummer defensively ; " the banks are closing down on him , and Wall Street is closing down on the banks . "   " It 's a Republican trick to disorganize the country , " declaredMiltiades . " Hell , do n't I know it ! " cried the drummer . " But they ca n't do it , " defied Miltiades ; " wait till the Democrats get under way with the South behind them , everythingwill go forward . " " I sure hope that 's so , " said Bivins , " but I 'm down here collecting . " The two men walked on , momentarily sympathetic in their common political faith . After some space Bivins began un-certainly : " By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask questions , but ... " Miltiades ' brief good-will faded somewhat . " Yes . . . what is it ? " " Do  --  do you know whether Lucius Handback is still goingwith Miss Sydna Crowninsl-ield ? " Miltiades was dourly amused at the question . " I am sorry to say I have n't the slightest information on that subject . " " Well . . . all right . . . I thought maybe . . . " The Colonel prepared to take leave of his companion . " Well , I 'm going this way . Where you headed for ? " " The Handback store , " said the drummer . Illumination broke over Miltiades . He suddenly understoodwhy Bradley had offered him the old Lacefield place for fifteen thousand dollars . He now regretted his counter offer of twelve thousand five hundred . If Handback 's creditorswere pressing him , he might get it even cheaper . He ejaculated on the impulse : " You know I 've got to go there too . " Then he thought how bitterly unwelcome he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's arm . " Look here , Bivins , when you get there , call Bill . Bradley to one side and tell him I say not one cent over nine thousand . You understand that , Not one cent over nine thousand . ' " Bivins glanced at him out of his reddish rimmed eyes .   " I understand that . " The two went on together a little farther . Miltiades was now loath to leave the drummer . In the midst of the exciting possibility of getting the old Lacefield place for a picayune , the thought of his future store popped into the Colonel 's head again . " Bivins , one of these days I may give you a great big order for high-class hardware . " " That 'll be fine , " said the drummer . " You wo n't forget to tell Bradley what I told you , will you ? " " Sure not . . . not a penny over nine thousand ? " " That 's right , " nodded Miltiades . P294ON THE second day after the creditors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Colonel Miltiades Vaiden owned the old Lacefield plantation . He had bought it from Bradley for the original amount the two men had named . Bradley claimed that Slim Bivins never delivered the Colonel'sfinal figure . " And why should he ? " inquired the real-estate man , closingcompletely his smoky eye , " when Bivins ' house is the heaviest creditor the Handbacks have ? Why should he take money out of his own pocket and put it in yours ? " What Bradley really paid for the place , Miltiades never found out . The amount recorded in the register or deeds was for one dollar paid in hand and other valuable considerations . Miltiades was mortally sure that Bradley had lied to him and cheated him , but then anyone who had anything to do with Bradley in a business way finally swung around to that point of view . An odd and rather absurd incident had determined the Colonel 's purchase of the Lacefield place . Three days before the meeting of the Handback creditors , Miltiades was walking home from town along Pine Street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass the wordless hostility of his brother 's house , and it was a sort of pleasure to walk by the equally wordless and possibly nonexistentsympathy in the Crowninshield home . In all Florence , only in Drusilla 's weathered manor did the Colonel hope for any mitigation of the moral sentence of theft which the town had passed upon him . P295There was a curious mental tang in the way Miltiades thought of Drusilla . It had a flavor of his dead wife , Ponny , . in it . When he thought of Drusilla , he felt it was without Ponny 's permission . When he walked up Pine Street it was with a sense of ghostly transgression . Sight of the manor itselfalways reminded him that Ponny was dead . An accompanyingmemory of Sydna chasing the urchins who had mocked him in the street somehow took away his dead wife 's disapproval . On this particular afternoon , as he passed the manor , a notion flitted through the Colonel 's head to enter and thank Sydna for what she had done for him . That , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past the house when he heard the Crowninshieldgate click . Came a patter of running steps behind him and a voice calling his name . The Colonel turned with a startled and wordless apprehensionof pleasure when he saw it was a negro girl in pursuitof him . He waited for her , wondering if she could possibly have some message from Drusilla . The black girl came to a breathless stand in front of him . " Coll Milt , " she panted , " my mammy said tell you Miss Gracie done set down on huh . " " Sat down on her ? " repeated Miltiades , not understanding . " Yes , suh , Miss Gracie set down on my mammy . " " Gracie Vaiden ? " he probed . " Yes , suh , Miss Gracie Vaiden , aw Miss Gracie Dill , aw Miss Gracie Light , aw Miss Gracie Beekman . . . . Miss , Gracie got a lot o ' names . " The black girl was calling over the roll of men , black and white , with whom Gracie had lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . " Do you mean Gracie is living with your mother ? " hazarded the Colonel , " do you mean she is putting up on your mother ? " " Yas suh , yas suh , dat 's whut I means . She 's settin ' down on Mammy . " P296The Colonel stood looking at the black girl for several moments . " Well . . . what are you telling me about it for ? " The girl was a little taken aback . " Mammy said she guess maybe you do somep'n ' bout hit . " " Who is your mammy ? " " Miss Tony . " " Where does she live ? " " At de house wid de gate . " This abbreviated description fitted the shack so well that the Colonel remembered it . He was sharply astonished . " What in the world is Gracie doing living with your mother ! " he ejaculated . " She say huh kinchonce make huh . " " Kinchonce ! " " Yas suh , huh kinchonce hu't huh . " " Conscience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscience . " " Well , " said the Colonel slowly , " I 'll call around and see what 's gone wrong with Gracie 's conscience . " Miltiades was faintly amused . He wondered if Gracie had got religion and had given up her post as Handback 's concubine , or had the merchant become so hard pressed for money that he had turned her out of the cottage ? This last offered itself as the true cause of Gracie 's homelessness and why this girl had come to him . Miltiades had brought it upon Gracie , and now he must do something about it . The Colonel stood thinking when he could go and see the quadroon . He felt he could not go at that moment , because Ponny would be waiting supper on him . Then he remembered that Ponny was dead . He turned about and started back toward town . Pammy Lee stood in the gate of the Crowninshield residence and watched him out of sight . At Miss Tony 's shack the Colonel found a rather puzzlingstate of fact . He asked Gracie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Handback did n't know anything about her change . Miltiades then asked why she was leaving thep297cottage . Her explanation was that Mr. Handback looked so terrible she could n't bear to see him any more ; she did n't want even to think of him again . " I tells huh hit 's de Lawd wuckin ' to save His chile f'um dat kine o ' life , " intoned Miss Tony solemnly . Both colored women were standing in the presence of the Colonel . As Miltiades did not care to sit in a negro 's chair , the three stood in the shack discussing the situation . " How came you to know anything about it ? " asked Gracie , out of her depression . " Well . . . I heard about it . " He could not admit that Miss Tony had sent him word , for that would reflect on the coffee-colored woman 's hospitality . Miltiades thought of providing another cottage for Gracie , not such a house as Handback had built for her , but a good substantial negro cabin whose roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for what she . had done . He really owed her his fortune . " I have been thinking , " said Gracie somberly , " of going North and educating Toussaint . " Miltiades shook his head . " Now , Gracie , no . . . no . . . that 's unpractical . . . How do you mean , educated ? " Gracie was sorry she had mentioned the topic . " Oh , I mean . . . know a good deal . " " Colored people , Gracie , " advised Miltiades earnestly and sincerely , " are hurt more than they are helped by education . When a colored person becomes educated there is no place for him . An educated man does n't want to do day labor in the fields . And where could Toussaint be a doctor , or a lawyer , or ever run a store bigger than a peanut stand . . . . " the Colonel continued to shake his head . " You do n't want to ruin him , Gracie . " The white man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality of truth . It made her dreams for Toussaint 's advancement appear utterly unreal . It producedin the quadroon , in a more refined and complicated form , the ancient agony of her slave days , when she had dreaded lest Solomon , her first husband , might be sold away from her , as indeed he finally was . The Colonel 's words made her feel sick . She wanted to sit down , but kept standing in her ex-master 's presence , looking into a fire of barrel staves on the hearth . " I tells huh , " said Miss Tony , " hit mus ' be ag'inst de Lawd 's will fuh Toussaint to go to some big school fuh Him to make huh han ' ovate evahthing she got lak she is done . " Gracie looked at her chocolate-colored friend . " That 's all right , Tony , " she said quickly . " Oh , ' scuse me , bliss Gracie , " ejaculated Miss Tony , clapping a hand over her thick lips . " Hand over what . . . how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . tuh , Mistah Han'back , " juggled out MissTony , who , under Gracie 's prohibition , could speak only afew words at a time . " He gave me a little money , " explained Gracie drearily , " and he needed it ; so I gave it back to him till he could get straightened out again . " Miltiades ' heart sank at Gracie 's stupidity . " How much ? " he asked in a disgusted tone . " About four hundred dollars . " " I swear , what a fool you are , Gracie . " He laughed shortly . " Well , now , that 's what I say about educating a nigger . Sister Cassandra educated you . . . now look what you do ! " This almost exonerated the Colonel from helping Gracie at all . If she was big enough fool to give back an insignificant . . . " Why , four hundred dollars wo n't help him at all , " scouted the Colonel , " it wo n't be a drop in the bucket ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " said Gracie in a small voice . " Then what the devil did you give it to him for ? " " Be-because , " cried Gracie desperately , " I  --  I couldn'tk-keep anything of h-his . . . after wh-what I 'd done ! " andshe began weeping.  |p299The  Colonel looked at her , shaking his head hopelessly . He did n't understand her . She had gone off into some feminineflightiness which he did not understand . . . into some nigger foolishness . " And that was the money you had saved up to send  --  " he tried to think of Toussaint 's name , but failed  --  " your boy off to school ? " Gracie nodded , blinking her eyes . " Well , " comforted the Colonel , after a moment 's thought , " I 'm not sure if this is n't the best thing that could have happenedfor your boy . Put him on a farm . Let him grow up into a man who is some account . It would be a lot better than making him into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonableness and his authority , the well known fact that he did not cheat negroes but treated them squarely and honorably and wished them well , overpowered Gracie . " Maybe it is , " she agreed bleakly , " but I do n't know how Toussaint will ever get along with anybody . He 's a proud boy . " Now , look here , " planned the Colonel hopefully , " Loober . . . you know Loober Snipes ? " Gracie shook her head . Miss Tony did . " He 's de niggah dat kep ' Mistah Lucius Han'back f'um shootin ' Col'l Milt , " she explained brightly . " That 's right , " said the Colonel , " and the Handbacks turned him off their place for what he did . He 's been hangingaround me asking me to put him on another place , and I really feel like I ought . " Miss Tony nodded deeply . " Da 's right ! Da 's right ! I kin say one thing fuh you , Col'l Milt , you got de bigges ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The compliment gave the Colonel a certain touch of pleasure . " Well , here 's my idyah . I 'll buy a farm big enough for two families and put Loob 's family and your family onto it , Gracie . I know I can get along with Toussaint . I never did have any trouble with colored folks . " Gracie gave a long sigh at this final vanishing of her dream for Toussaint . " Yes , " she said slowly , " I 'm sure you 'll get along with Toussaint all right . . . " and in her thoughts she added , " since he is your own son . "  |p301IT  WAS dusk when Miltiades left Gracie , and it was quite dark when he reached Market Street once more . This darknessgratified the Colonel . In its obscurity he could walk the streets without that constant , unconscious screwing up of his moral resistance to meet the silent recollection of his theft in the mind of every passer-by . The darkness did not remember his transgression . Within its bosom , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and delayed getting home as long as possible . The emptiness of the mean Cherry Street house oppressed him . When he was at home he was continuallybeset by the impression that Ponny was in another room and presently would come moving her shameless bulk through the door . Once or twice , when his dead wife 's presence bore more sharply upon him than usual , the Colonel , sitting alone in his room , had thought , " No wonder the ignorant believe in ghosts . " So now he walked slowly , to arrive at his home as late , and to go to sleep as quickly , as he could . A voice said out of a blur of gateposts : " Is that you , Uncle Milt ? " The Colonel paused . " This is Miltiades Vaiden . " A slender figure stepped out of the yard and fell in beside the Colonel . Miltiades walked on , vaguely annoyed because the presence of his nephew estopped his formless reverie . " You know , " began Jerry , after walking for a space , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little reason . "   " Why , what 's happened to you ? " inquired the Colonel absently . " Why-y . . . nothing much . . . . I was just thinking . . . . Now , look here , now . . . say something comes up and somebody does n't want to associate with me . All right , well and good . . . but I say it 's unreasonable . " " Why is it unreasonable ? " queried the uncle , with a touch of curiosity . " Why , because , if they were really my friends , then they would be in rapport with me  --  at least , to some extent . They would have to be , would n't they ?  --  or we could n't be friends at all . " The word " rapport , " which Jerry mispronounced , was unfamiliar to Miltiades . " Why do you say that ? " inquired Miltiades with a touch of pride in his nephew . " Because , if friendship depends on . . . well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , Uncle Milt ? . . . Then , no matter what the other person did , you really could n't withdraw your friendship , because if your souls fit once , they 're bound to fit always . " " Why , no-o , I 'm afraid I do n't quite see that , " said Miltiades . " It 's very simple , " said Jerry . " If friendship is a communionof souls , then if anything bad turns up in your friend , that shows there was some answering crookedness in you . And instead of condemning him , you ought to blame yourself . " Miltiades was amused at this involved reasoning , but Jerry 's remarks cast also a not so humorous side glance on himself . " How came you to think of all these things ? " inquired Miltiades uncomfortably . " Well , I have lost several so-called friends lately , " admittedJerry , " and I just got to thinking about them . " " What did you do to lose them , Jerry ? " inquired the uncle with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But that 's very strange for you to do nothing and loseyour friends and then think up all this rigmarole to condemnthem . I think you 'll have to admit that 's a little queer . " " It 's not what I did , it 's what I am , " said Jerry gloomily . " What you are ? " " Yes . " " You mean your family ? " " Yes . " Miltiades dropped his catechism . " Pay no attention to them , " he advised . " Remember you 're a Vaiden . You are equal to the best and better than the most . " " Yes , I think of that , too , " said Jerry . The boy slackened his gait and let his uncle get ahead . " Well , good-night , Uncle Milt , " he said , stopping entirely . Miltiades came back and shook hands with his nephew . " Good-night , Jerry . " When the two separated , Jerry rubbed the hand his uncle had touched up and down on the leg of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncle Miltiades.  |p304YOUNG  Jerry Catlin had talked and walked with his uncle Miltiades Vaiden as a last resort . He had been standing at the boarding-house gate with a wrought-up feeling that he must talk to someone or lose himself in the endless circlings of his own thoughts . But there was one droll difference in young Jerry Catlin'sthoughts when he was alone and when he was in companywith his uncle Miltiades . Alone , Jerry thought pitifullyand helpfully of the pupils in college and the people in town who had more or less ostracized him , owing to his relationship to his uncle . He thought of them as people whom he wished he could help to a better understanding of life ; he would inform them , lift them up . But in company with his uncle Miltiades he had broken out into a diatribe against them ; they were fools and idiots . His uncle left him vibrating with wrath and intolerance for such a folk . When Miltiades had gone , this militancy quieted in the youth once more . His heart beat . He felt as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must control myself , " he thought , and after a few moments he added , " this is an opportunity for me to practisecomposure and humility of soul . " No sooner had he thought this than an extraordinary notiondawned on Jerry . He walked back down the street , astonished at himself , thinking it over , wondering if it were possible . What he suspected was this : it might be that his uncle Miltiades had taken the cotton , that his friends had withdrawn from him as a preordained test . Perhaps the mystic brotherhood had brought these tribulations upon him to observe how he endured them and to see if he were worthyp305of acceptance in their order ! The thought of walking the earth in constancy and humility filled young Jerry with its ancient poetry . A great sweetness filled the boy at the thought . His ostracism suddenly became wings to his heart . He wished , after he had met the test , after he was transfigured , that he might lay his hands on the people who had misprized him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boarding house Jerry was too excited to go inside . He did not want to be around Sandusky , who had grown brusquer and more impatient than ever . He did not want the carping law student to bedevilhim out of his mood of messiahship . In his exaltation Jerry walked on past his boarding house , down the street , beneath the high jeweling of the night . He felt himself native to the very sheen and quiver of the stars . In their luminous mystery he sensed his own eternal past . Presently he found himself on Pine Street , in the profoundgloom of the trees . As he walked , he could see the stars moving above their foliage in the tiniest needle pricks of light . Jerry went on down the street , touching the fence posts to keep his direction . His emotion presently lost some of its mystical quality and became an unordered trembling and suspense . He stopped in front of a box-scented gate and stood with little shivers of sweetness passing through him . He wondered if Sydna were busy . It seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his restlessness and exaltation had tended . He wished Sydna would come out so that he could ask her frankly if she would mind seeing him and talking to him again . He would tell her that he was very lonesome , but if she did not want to see him , he would bless her and think tenderly of her always . Then a notion came to Jerry to will that Sydna should come out to the gate . It would test that phase of his occult training . He tried this for a few moments . He stood looking fixedly in the direction of the front door , willing that Sydna should appear in it . He tried simply to will her to appear in the doorway , as he thought that would require less effort than to make her come clear to the gate . If he got her to the door he could call her the rest of the way . He had hardly begun his concentration when he heard a sound toward the house . Jerry was surprised at himself . His heart began beating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he heard steps on the graveled path . Before he could see anything at all a voice quite near him gasped in a startled undertone : " Who is that ? " Jerry realized that Sydna did not know she was being willed to come . " It 's me . . . Jerry , " he said , trembling . A figure appeared close to him at the gate . It was the negro girl on her way home after her work . She peered at Jerry curiously . " Is  --  is you waitin ' full somebody , Mist ' Jer'y ? " she asked . " Listen , Pammy Lee , " said Jerry in a hurried whisper , " run back in the house and tell Miss Sydna I 'm out here . " " Yes , suh , Mist ' Jer'y , I jess whispah to huh , unbeknownstto anybody else , Mist ' Jer'y 's at de gate . ' " Pammy Lee turned and vanished in a murmur of gravel on her exciting errand . The tall youth stood outside the gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odor of the box came to him like some remembered sweetness . Romantic impressions which he had received as a child from his mother 's tales roused to life in Jerry . He felt as if he were all the lovers who ever had waited for their ladies . All their impatiences , doubts , and tremors suffused him . He thought in a kind of tentative desolation , " What if she wo n't come after all ! " He felt he could not possibly go back to his humility and saintlinessfor comfort . He did not know what he would do . The moments lengthened into minutes , and the minutesp307stretched into an endlessness that lost the character of time . A throbbing was in his temples , and a weight at the base of his throat . Presently he knew that Sydna was not coming . Then every moment he thought that the next moment he would go away . After a while he had no hope left that Sydna would come , but continued standing at the gate with his power of withdrawing paralyzed . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path . The youth leaned toward the rustling and whispered : " Sydna ! Sydna ! " A darkness that was her form and a paleness that was her face appeared before the boy . " Jerry , " she asked in reproach , " why did n't you come in ? " " Why-y . . . Sydna . . . I did n't know whether you would want me or not . " " The idea ! The idea of such a thing ! " cried Sydna . Jerry reached to unlatch the gate and found Sydna 's hand at the same task . The two hands suddenly gave up the latch and squeezed each other . The feel of Sydna 's fingers pressing his own overwhelmed Jerry with sweetness . He fumbled the latch open with his other hand . He stepped inside , still clinging to her fingers . He moistened his lips and whispered , " Where will we go ? " The girl hesitated . " We . . . might go to the hammock , " she said unevenly . " Well . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hand through the unseen curves of the box . At the end of their walk both groped with their free hands for the hammock . Jerry touched it and said in a broken voice : " Here it is . " He drew her to it . They held it and tried to sit in it . The yielding netting tipped them backwards and pressed their bodies together . Jerry lay utterly still , filled with a mixture of rapture and sharp apprehension lest Sydna pick herself up again . She at least did not do so at once . " I heard about you , " she said protectively . " Heard . . . what ? " said Jerry , hardly observing what either Sydna or himself was saying . " The way those little flippety second-year girls have treated you . " " Oh , that . . . " said Jerry , " . . . that . . . . " With the melting sweetness of Sydna 's hip and shoulder against his own , the second-year girls were as remote from the hobbledehoyas the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing with yourself all these days ? " she asked gently . " Nothing at all . " " Seeing nobody ? " " Nobody but Aunt Rose and Sandusky and Uncle Augustus . " At this Sydna ejaculated , " Sandusky ! " with a notion of telling Jerry of the law student 's conversation with her , but she broke off her sentence and sighed . All this talk had not the faintest connection with the ecstatic torment rising in Jerry 's motionless body . A tremblingseized him of which he was ashamed and which he tried to control . " Did you finally go to that reception ? " asked Sydna . " What reception ? " " Why , the one the girls would n't go with you . " " Oh . . . yes . . . no . . . no , I did n't go . " " Do n't you know whether you went or not ? " " No , I did n't go . " The girl hesitated a moment . " How came you not to come here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " " Have you wanted to come ? " " Oh , yes , Sydna . . . of course . " He turned toward her , filled with a sort of prickling sensation , and half threw his arm about her waist . P309Sydna caught his hand and pressed it against her breast . " You should have come ! " she stressed impulsively . " I wanted you to come ! When I heard about what they were doing to you , it almost made me sick ! " The feel of her supple bosom moulded around the back of his hand struck a kind of voluptuous terror through the youth . With a sort of anguish he desired to cup his palm over the mound and explore its amazing pliancy . But a feeling of profanation kept him motionless . He focused all his sense of touch into the back of his hand . The softness of her breast made him want to melt into her and lose his existence in her own . Any closer intimacy with her body seemed immeasurablyremote and impossible to Jerry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his arm bent awkwardly across her waist and torso . All he desired was merely to turn his hand . His body was charged with a growing desire which , somehow , was as far away from him as the reception he had missed , as the sophomore girls who would not go with him . At the tension of his body he felt a kind of shame . Sydna lay for a long time in the passive sweetness of a woman . She would have liked Jerry definitely to put his arms around her and fondle her , but she found this timidity like a delicate rapture after her anxiety about the boy . She felt in all the nerves of her body a safety with Jerry , and a delight in him . All his ascetic exercises were like gold which he had saved and which he was now spending , silently and unawares , upon her . Never in her life had she known a man who resembled Jerry ; never had she known a man who had thought of some other thing than money or position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence in the greatness of their sensations . They made no further attempt to conceal their dual rapture in talk . After a long while Sydna sighed and said she would have to go in . " I guess Mother wonders where I am , " and she thought yearningly how innocent Jerry was and how sweet it was for him to be that way . " I hate to go home , " said the boy . " Sleep here in the hammock , " she invited with a little laugh . " When you go away it 'll be too cold . " She said nothing , but smoothed his hand and then slipped her fingers between his hand and her bosom , as if she were consoling him momentarily for his loss . She thought to herselfpensively and wistfully , " I am four or five years older . than he is . . . three or four . . . . " She had an impulse to pick him up and hold him always in her bosom , never to let anyone wound him ; aloud she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go in . " Here she loosed herself definitely , got up from the hammock , clung to Jerry 's hand as far as she could reach , said , " Good-bye , " and went into the house . When she was gone , Jerry became conscious of the strong passion of his body . It was as if some opiate had expired in him and left him flooded with the pain of desire for some woman . He got up from the hammock and adjusted his twisted clothes . He hated to go home . He hated to go to bed and be tortured all night long by unsleeping desire . As he groped his way among the hedges toward the gate a voice in the bushes gasped out : " Oh , Mist ' Jer'y , is dat you ? " Jerry was shocked . " Yes , it 's me . " " Did  --  did she gwi ' off'n leave you lak dat ? " moaned the voice in bitter disappointment . Jerry went groping toward the hidden one , and his hands touched and moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of Pammy Lee.  |p311WHEN  Pammy Lee reached her mother 's cabin in East Florence , the girl acted so oddly and broke out giggling at times so foolishly that Miss Tony inquired into the matter , and presently knew the particulars of her adventure . The coffee-colored woman was wrathful . She clumped Pammy Lee 's corkscrew wool . " Be ' shamed of yo'se'f ! " she admonished . " Whut if Brothah Lump Mowbray knowed you was a-carryin ' on like dat ! He 'd say , Shame on you , Pammy Lee ! ' would n't he , Miss Gracie ? " " Yes , he would , " agreed Gracie , who knew that Lump disapproved of any woman having any relations with any man except himself . " An ' whut would de Lawd say ? " went on Miss Tony , appealing to a still higher authority . " He 'd say , Be ' shamed of yo'se'f , you stinkin ' little niggah gal , breakin ' my commandments ! ' " The mother reached out to give Pammy Lee another thump , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mind slid off to the practical consequences of her daughter 's indiscretion . " Now , ap ' as not , you 'll be havin ' a baby , an ' wha in de worl ' is I gwi ' put hit , I don ' know . " " Hit kin sleep wid me , Mammy , " piped a very small voice from the common bed of the children . " Shot yo ' mouth , Hezekiah . Dat baby wouldn ' sleep wid a great big of stinkin ' niggah boy lak you is . Dat baby would be a pa'tick'lah baby . Hit would be a fine baby . . . . Shame on you , Pammy Lee . . . . " She paused in the midst of her mechanical shaming , " Well , you ai n't gwi ' back to Miss Drusilla 's no mo ' aftah this , Pammy Lee . "   " Why ? " asked the daughter in surprise . " ' Cause you 's a woman now . You 's wuth mo 'n any fifty cents a week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lookin ' fuh a place wid mo ' pay full you . I'se gwi ' send Jinny Lou up to Miss Dru 's in yo ' place . " She turned to a smaller girl and directed , " finny Lou , you go to Miss Drusilla 's in de mawnin ' an ' let huh lea'n you to cook . An ' you Iissen to what she tells you , you aimpty-haided li'l ' niggah ! " Miss Tony 's monologue might very well have run on with its homilies and reproofs until morning , but it was broken into by Hezekiah exclaiming : " Dale goes Mist ' Han'back , Miss Gracie ! " The tiny boy was peering out of the single pane of glass set in the side of the cabin . Miss Tony flew into her little son . " Hezekiah Hampton ! " she cried . " What has Miss Gracie got to do wid Mistuh Han'back fo ' you to be tellin ' huh who 's a-goin ' by ? Now , you Jess lay back down in yo ' bed an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tellin ' Miss Gracie , dah go Mistuh Han'back . . . dat 's a nice thing fuh a li'l ' boy to say ! " The man in the alley whom Hezekiah had recognized continued on his way to Gracie 's cottage . He walked slowly , not thinking of the quadroon at all , after the manner of a man going to the home of a long-kept mistress . The merchant was turning over and over in his head a multiplicity of plans to obtain money . On one plantation he had some corn ; on another , hay ; here were a few hogs , and there a bin of oats  --  pitiful odds and ends left over from a vast and ravaged granary . Ile was trying to meet certain immediate obligations without selling other plantations . Now , in the midst of his planning , he thought of Colonel Miltiades Vaiden . He stopped his mental arrangements with a sort of spasm and wished the Colonel in the bottom of hell . He wished his son Lucius had shot the Colonel ! He wished . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts went back to his bills.  |p313He  had to pay them or go under . His whole life 's work was about to vanish . He had spent all his life , ever since he was seventeen , working every single day in a dark , smelly store . His holidays had been Sundays , Christmas , a week that he had been sick , and the day he had got married . When he was a boy he had started clerking for a man named Alley in Haleyville , Alabama . Then through a drummerhe had got a job in Florence with a merchant named Stout . He had bought a fourth interest in Stout 's business ; then , during a business depression , he purchased the other three fourths . By the time the Civil War broke out he was doing the largest business in Florence . He financed nearly all the big plantations in the county through his cotton broker in New Orleans . He carried a large stock of merchandise . The Civil War completely destroyed his credit and his trade . It forced him into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not even the technique of how to get wealthy again . As a matter of fact , the war ushered in a new mode of accumulating money . This was the method of working the negroes under mortgages instead of under simple chattel slavery . Handback and thousands of merchants like him perfected this method . It did away completelywith the great landowners , or , rather , it shifted the proprietorship in the land from the manor to the store . Now , when Handback had built up this great organization , MiltiadesVaiden , with a little wildcat claim against him for five bales of cotton , had come and stolen all he possessed  --  every liquid dollar he had in the world . He spat out his acrid thoughts of the thievish Colonel . Ile had come to the cottage he had built for the quadroon . The mere dark shape of the cottage soothed away to some extent the rancor that filled the merchant 's heart . It promised him a respite . He meant to drink some rye whisky , talk to Gracie a while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep of alcohol and a woman and escape his worries for a space . The cottage was dark . The merchant did not ring but groped under the doormat and found a key . He let himself in . From the hallway he called in an undertone : " Gracie . . . this is me . " He thought she must be sleeping soundly , because she usually answered at once : " Come in , Mr. Handback . " That was one of the pleasant things about Gracie . She was always quiet and respectful and ministered to him with the agreeable solicitude of a highly trained servant . He alwaysfelt that this was his cottage where he could come and drink and sleep , and that the quadroon took care of it for him . It was his house . It was his chapel , and Gracie was his acolyte . The merchant opened the bedroom door and listened for , but could not hear , the sound of the quadroon 's breathing . " Gracie ! " he said in a ow tone . " Gracie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he wondered about that . He drew a match and struck it almost silently on his trousers . He held the little flame above his head and saw the bed was empty . This surprised and disappointed him . Usually Gracie was in the cottage . She was , he supposed , gone over to one of the neighbors . He went to a lamp on the dresser , conserving his match , and lighted it . In the full light the bed was neatly made , but somehow it had the look of not having been used for two or three days . What details gave it that appearance , the merchant did not know . " I wonder where she 's gone to ? " he thought with some concern . He took the lamp and made the round of the house , the kitchen , a dining room , two extra bedrooms , all a little musty from disuse . The merchant returned , very puzzled , to the bedroom . On the center table he saw a pink envelope with his name on it . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thatp315Gracie was gone at least for the night . The note would tell him where . He wished resentfully that she had chosen some other time . He felt that she had treated him badly . She knew of this crisis in his affairs ; she knew that he was in trouble . She had returned to him the four hundred dollars he had given her . Now , for her to be away from home on the night he chose to visit her , that showed an indifference toward him . She really was , he supposed , quite indifferent to him . . . as he was to her . She was just a colored woman whom he hired . He opened the envelope and read the enclosure , MR . J. HANDBACK , City . Mr. Handback , you need your house . I am going away for good . I ca n't keep house for you any more . I have n't done you right , and I keep thinking about it all the time . Do n't try to find me , because if you knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more anyway . Very respectfully , GRACIE DILL . For several seconds Handback stood with the note in his hand , simply looking at it . Its statement that Gracie had gone away and would not come back did not seem real . He read the letter over again with a feeling that he must have overlooked something  --  some sentence telling where he could go find her . Then his mind gathered the lines , " Do n't try to find me . If you knew what I did , you would n't want to employ me any more . " The merchant sat down by the table . His hands began trembling so he could hardly hold the note before his eyes : If you knew what I did , you would n't want to employme any more anyway . Very respectfully , GRACIE DILL.  | Whatever it was that Gracie had done was a minor matter . Behind that , to the merchant , lay the blank emptiness that she was gone . . . that she was coming back no more . The man sat looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chilliness in his cheeks . He looked around the room and tried to think what he would do now , but the effect was like trying to get some heavy , lifeless thing in the top of his head to move . " I do n't see how she could go away , " he murmured aloud , " when she knew I was so worried . . . when she knew I was in such trouble . " He tried to think again what he could do . He did not see how he could get through this tangle into which his affairs had fallen if he had no mental release , for a few hours , from his debts . He had never dreamed that Gracie was so necessary to him until she was gone . He read the note again , holding it at a distance from his eyes , like an old man . He speculated this time on what she had done that would cause him not to want her any more . . . given herself to some other man , he supposed . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a stimulantafter the numbing blow of her desertion . He thought , bewildered and resentful : " I do n't understand her . . . . If she did it , why in God 's name did she have to tell me ? " He tore the note up with its formal opening of " Mr. Handback " and its formal closing of " Very respectfully . " It was thus negroes always addressed the whites in their infrequent letters . They would not presume upon the familiarityof " Dear Sir . " During their years of joint occupancy of the cottage neither Gracie nor the merchant had ever uttered the word " love . " J. Handback locked up the cottage he had built six years before and walked back through the darkness to his store.  |p317GRACIE  'S actual removal to the Lacefield place did not occur until two weeks and three days later . She stayed on with Miss Tony , who was now quite content and even pleased with her guest , since she knew that Gracie finally would go away . A little visit two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; only the vista of a perpetuity dismayed her . Once during this period Gracie went back to the white cottage for something she had left behind , but she could not get in . The key which she had kept under the mat was gone . During this interval Miltiades was fixing up the Lacefieldplace for Gracie . He purchased a horse and rode leisurely about the countryside , picking up a few mules and some farm implements where he could find tlicm . Mules were obtainable only by trading around like this . There was no regular mule market nearer than Columbia , Tennessee . The farm implements the Colonel also bought second hand , matching his trained sense of value against that of the tenantfarmers . Some of these tenants made very poor trades . Take Gibeon Dalrymple , for example . Gibeon sold the Colonel three mattocks , a shovel , and a " possum " dog for four dollars . Gibeon then agreed to keep the dog for the Colonel until the latter called for him . Later in the week , Miltiades traded the dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the Colonel finally drove the quadroon and her son to the plantation he outlined what he wanted Toussaint to do . During the winter months Toussaint would paint up the houses , renew the fences , grub out the sassafras sprouts that had sprung up in the fields .   " I want to get everything into the shape it once was , " explained the Colonel to the octoroon youth . Toussaint nodded at each of these injunctions , saying : " Yes , sir . . . . Yes , sir . . . . Yes , sir . . . . " It was an odd , inexpressive sort of agreement . There was something blanketed about the youth , something which the Colonel , in all his experience with negroes , had not met before . But the boy would come out all right . He was of the old Vaiden stock of negroes . The Colonel would rehabilitate the old Lacefield place , built up its productiveness , restore its style . The idea came to him that he might have a country estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to time from the grind of business in his store . As the Colonel drove past BeShears ' Crossroads , a group of white men and negroes were loitering on the platform . One of the white men called out : " Hey-oh , Colonel , is that the town nigger you 're goin ' to make a farmer out of ? " And the whole group broke out guffawing at the idea . " I think he 'll work all right , " returned the Colonel genially . " Yes , an ' that nigger woman there with you , she looks like she would work all right , too , " called out some lickerishwag . The Colonel made no reply to this , and the group laughed again as if his silence admitted improper relations with the woman he was installing on his farm . Alex Cady walked out toward the buggy . " What house you goin ' to put ' em in , Colonel ? " he inquired , with the assurance of a tenant on the same place . " Have n't decided , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a business man . Miltiades sensed that Alex was fishing for his choice of houses . The crowd laughed at Alex 's discomfiture . " You might ' a ' knowed you would n't git nothin ' out ofP319the Colonel , Alex , " they twitted . " Nobody knows what the Colonel 's goin ' to do tull he does it . . . . If you do n't believe that , go ast of man Han'back ! " Some of the white men on the platform laughed violently at this . The negroes maintained a shocked silence at such a jest against the owner . The allusion abruptly destroyed for Miltiades his elation at taking possession of the old Lacefieldplace . Gracie looked back at the men on the platform and said with controlled contempt : " There certainly has been a come-down in country folks . " " A come-down , " repeated Miltiades in a flatted tone : " they 're gone . . . they 've been gone for years . " The thought filled the Colonel with a passing melancholy . Gracie 's remark made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countryside , he had hardly observed its imperceptible , steady decline . It was like the face of an old acquaintance whose scars and wrinkles accumulate so graduallythat only by an effort of memory one reconstructs the vanished countenance . To Gracie the weathered Crossroads store , the old spring behind it with its pool surrounded by dead stumps ; the thin acres of the Reserve with an occasional negro shack here and there ; all held the shock of a first discovered change . She had not been back to the Crossroads since the year old man Jimmie Vaiden , her white father , had died . Now her surroundings filled Gracie with the most painfulmemories . Down this rutted Reserve road , her little Missy , the gray-eyed Marcia , had ridden to be imprisoned in the Yankee camp . At the Crossroads store , old man BeShearshad sold Solomon , her first husband , to a negro dealer . The last time Gracie had seen the Lacefield plantation its meadows were full of Yankee tents . In one of these tents she had sojourned as the mistress of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man Jimmie , had tried to reclaim tier as his property from Beekman , but the Yankee soldiers had laughed at him ; and she saw her father , who was also her owner , ride away cursing her and on the verge of apoplexy . But above all the scene around her reminded Gracie of Beckman . She and Beekman had walked along these lanes . An old sedge field which she was passing had been a meadow then , and here was pitched the tent of her uncandled honeymoon . The impression of the Yankee officer became so strong that she almost expected to see him at some turn of the road . The cream-colored girl had loved Beekman . The old Lacefield manor itself was deplorable . The silver poplar grove that had stood on its lawn had long since been used for firewood . All that was left of a flower pit that had lain back of the mansion was a depression three or four feet deep and choked with weeds . The great gate was gone , and Miltiades could have driven his buggy anywhere across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of the chipped columns of the portico . " Gracie , " said the Colonel , " you can stay here , or I 'll put you in one of the cabins on the place . You have your choice . " " I wonder if the roof leaks ? " speculated Gracie , looking at the heavy , lifeless pile . " I imagine it does , " said Miltiades . " Maybe some of the rooms are dry , " said Gracie hopefully . " I want to put a new roof on the whole house , " said Mil tiades , looking at the sloughing columns and the little wrought-iron balcony at the level of the second story . The banisters sagged at one side and were evidently held by a single rail . " If you 're going to do that , " decided Gracie , " we 'll take this place . " " And I 'm glad you will , " said Miltiades . " I 'm glad there is some connection between you and what the manor used to be . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live in the Lacefield manor , " said Gracie . P321And for a moment she and the Colonel stood as man and woman who felt each other 's involved and tragic role in a catastrophe which was so great that it stretched beyond both their comprehensions . The Colonel gave more instructions to Toussaint about the rehabilitation of the place , and then started to his buggy to drive away . Gracie told Toussaint to hurry and unhitch the Colonel 's buggy for him . The son moved deliberately . He undid the bridle from the ancient hitching post , hooked it over the catch at the top of the collar , and stood holding the bits , looking at the white man with appraising gray eyes . There was a quality in him which Miltiades could not quite fathom . The Colonel referredthis to the man who he thought was the boy 's father . " If he takes after Beekman , " thought the owner of the plantation , " he will at least be energetic . " And a droll notion struck him that the solitary benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had improved the energy of some of the negroes in the second generation in the South.  |p322AT  A cold turn in the weather Toussaint Vaiden drove to the hills beyond BeShears ' store for a load of wood . This was free wood to be had for the taking . Nobody inquiredits ownership . An industrious negro could even have cut some of this wood and sold it in Florence , but the tenants very seldom supplied themselves , much less anyone else . Toussaint , both going and coming , drove past the cabins of the other tenants in a morose daydream which was his habitual mood . When he reached home again his mother said that she had heard a knocking down at the stables while he was gone , and she did n't know what it was . He asked her what did it sound like , and she repeated , with a woman 's vagueness , that it was just a knocking . She evidently had been nervous about going down herself to see what it was . The son said he would look around as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white negro forgot this commission . As he unhitched his animals his mind returned to the continual theme of his reveries : how he and his mother would move to a place where they were not known , and Toussaint would slip off his negrohood and would become a white man . He would be white . He would be free of being a servant , of being bossed and swindled and stoned . He would be the equal of any man . The octoroon led his mules to their stalls with an inner warmth at what he had borne . That would all be changed . He would use the money he made here on the plantation to send himself and his mother North . P323Without a break in his thoughts he set about following Colonel Vaiden 's directions . He went to a shed , got out a small keg of oxide of lead , and began mixing it in a gallon of linseed oil . He picked up a stick and stirred and poured and stirred and poured . After a while he took the new cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint on the wagon . The brilliant red stood out against the uniform gray of the stables and colored the painter 's mood . Ile thought in this new place where they were going he and his mother might pass for Spaniards . They could say his father was an American who had married his mother in Cuba . In the midst of this reverie a dry nasal voice behind him said : " Hey-oh , paintin ' her up , air ye ? " Toussaint glanced around with a startled feeling that the speaker had read his forbidden thoughts . A few steps away the smallish figure of the white tenant stood leaning on an ax . The white negro instantly became uncommunicative . " Yes . . . I 'm painting it . " Cady looked on for several moments in silence , then asked in a curious voice : " What you paintin ' it fer ? " The Colonel told me to . " " Why , hell , what of that ? He ai n't got no way of makin ' you . It ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment anotherthought entered the white tenant 's head : " He ai n't payin ' you extry fer it , is he ? " " No . " " I did n't imagine he was . " As Toussaint made no reply to this , the white man finally added : " Especially as that 's my waggin . " Toussaint was a little disconcerted at this ; he turned around and asked : " How came it yours ? "   " Why , by God , because I paid for it , " exclaimed the white man instantly belligerent . " I mean , how did the Colonel come by it ? " " Oh , he jest borryed it from me to do a little haulin ' on the place . " Toussaint hardly knew whether to go on painting or not . His strokes slowed down under his indecision , but he said nothing . " I may be taking it back one of these days , " said Cady , " when I get ready fer it . " Again Toussaint remained silent . Something about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them there shut-mouth niggers , " observed the white man disagreeably , " like that there Lucy Lacefleld that lives in the house next to mine . " " I do n't see what there is to say if you 're going to take the wagon . " Cady considered this , judicially . " Well , I God , now , they ai n't  --  if that 's what ye 're thinkin ' I guess it 's all right . " The belligerent little white man hesitated , walked back down the line of doors in the stable , entered one , and presentlycame out with an armful of fresh red cedar wood . For Cady to get freshly cut cedar out of the tumble-down stalls struck Toussaint as an odd thing . He quit his painting , walked to the door of the stall , and looked in . All of the stalls were made with cedar posts . In this particular one , the posts were cut down and split up . Red and white chips lay over the earthen floor . The octoroon looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? " he asked in blank amazement . " Ye  --  naw , " hesitated Cady . " I jest saw these sticks layin ' in here , and I thought I 'd take a few home fer my of womanto cook with . " " Why , the devil , " exclaimed Toussaint , " that 's right fresh cut , and my mother said she heard you down here chopping this morning ! "  | " Yore maw heard me chopping ! " demanded Cady warmly . " She told me so the minute I got home , " said Toussaint . " Well , if yore maw told you that , " nodded Cady deliberately , " she told you a damn lie . . . the yellow of devil ! " A kind of tingle whipped through the octoroon from his chest to his finger tips . He flung his brush , and it hit the white man on the side of his head , giving the impression of a sudden horrible wound . Cady swore , lifted his ax , and rushed at the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the ground amid sparks of fire . The boy 's heart was drumming wildly . He caught up a stone and almost let drive at the redsplashedlittle man who was rushing at hirn again . " Stop ! Stop there , Cady ! " he yelled with the stone drawn back . The white man came , in spewing oaths and obscenity . " You damn yellow bastard ! Drive yore waggin by my house an ' never turn yore damn head ! " The ax crashed down again . The throat of the handle banged down on a tire and stung the white man 's hands . Toussaint dodged again , trembling over throwing the stone . Visions of white revenge danced before his eyes if he touched a white man , and as he thought , he threw . Came a crack . The ax fell one way and Cady fell another . Horror swept over Toussaint . There was a spot of deeper red on the white man 's temple , and this gave the impression that the whole side of his head was torn away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violently abusingthe octoroon . The negro 's heart pounded . He was more frightened of the white man on the ground than when he was up charging with his ax . This might mean any sort of punishment for him , a jail term , a sentence to the coal mines , a visitation of white men . . . . He was babbling : " Mr. Cady , I had to do it ! You 'd ' a ' killed me , Mr. Cady ! Ave you much hurt , Mr. Cady ? "  | " You God-damn nigger ! Throwin ' a rock ! " He tried to get up , but fell down again . Toussaint ran to him . " Mr. Cady , do n't hit me , an ' I 'll help you up ! " The white man held out his hand and was helped up . He cursed steadily . When he was on his feet he told Toussaint to hand him his ax . The octoroon did this , holding it by its blade and reaching the handle to the white man at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the negro . Then , with a great effort , he stooped , picked up the pieces of cedar , and moved uncertainly out of the gate and down the road . As he went he called back : " I 'll git ye fer this , nigger ! Hittin ' a white man with a rock ! Yore day 's a-comin ' , nigger ! " And he staggered down the road and out of sight . Toussaint stood in the stable yard , sick with fright . He was not afraid of Cady or anything Cady could do . He was afraid of white men . If he were brought before a court , any sort of punishment might be put upon him . The white negro picked up his paintbrush from the ground . He looked at it and was distraught because he had thrown it . He did not want to go back to the manor as excited as he was ; his mother would be frightened . He pondered what he should tell her . " My God , " he thought desperately , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had been white ! " He clenched his fists at the scurrilous names Cady had heaped upon his mother . If he had been white he would have killed Cady . He would have beaten his head to a jelly with stones ! A girl with a troop of black children behind her came hurrying up the road toward the manor . The girl herself was of a tan color . Who she was and why she hurried up the road with the children following her , Toussaint had not the slightest idea . He stood watching them go by.  | , A moment later a chorus of soft-toned negro voices piped out : " There he is , Miss Lucy ! There 's Mistuh Toussaint , stan'in ' in de lot . " The girl Lucy came up to the gate . " Toussaint , what did you do to Mr. Cady ? " she asked in a shocked voice . " Why  --  he called my mother names . . . . I hit him with a rock ! " " Will he die ? " gasped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was paint , " recollected Toussaint . At this the children began laughing and ejaculating : " Lawzy me ! He sho ' was painted up ! You sho ' painted dat white man 's haid , Mistuh Toussaint ! " " Hush , " said the girl to the children , and then to the youth : " It scared us all so . We came over to find out . We did n't know what had happened ! " She was evidently very frightened . " Well , as I say , we did have a fight , " admitted Toussaint , " I threw my paintbrush first . I guess I ought n't . Then he struck at me two or three times with his ax . Finally I hit him in the head with a rock and knocked him down . " The girl stood with her hand on the fence , thinking intently . " Children , you may go home , " she directed ; " there wo n't he any more school today . " The children with the humorous mouths and long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road , walking in crooked lines for amusement . Some of the childrentouched the others and then walked a little faster in order not to be touched in return . . . slow little games . They were all cold , underfed , and underclad . The girl teacher remained at the gate . " I certainly am glad it 's no worse than paint , " she breathed . " Is your mother at home ? "  | " Yes , but I was hoping she would n't hear about this . " " She really ought to know , " said Lucy . " It might be a good idea for you to go and tell Colonel Vaiden , too , so if Mr. Cady gets out a warrant the Colonel will bail you out . " The tan-colored girl spoke with the certainty of a thought-out plan . " Well , all right , I 'll do that , " agreed Toussaint , feeling much relieved himself at some definite thing for him to do . The girl Lucy spoke a careful English which Toussaint had never heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went out into the road and joined her . " Do you teach those children every day ? " he asked curiously . " When they are not picking cotton or hoeing . " " Where do you teach ' em ? " " We 've been using an empty cotton pen . The boys are going to ask the Colonel for some bricks from the manor to build a fireplace in it . " " In the cotton pen ? " " Yes , we put up poles and thatched it with hay . I told the children that that was the way the negro people built their . homes in Africa . I thought it would leak , but it does n't . " There was a touch of pride in Lucy 's voice that she and her pupils had overcome the difficulty of the roofless cotton pen . " Well , I know I can pick you up enough loose bricks around the manor to build you a fireplace , " promised Toussaint . " When you finish painting your wagon , let 's do it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manor . She had been intending to call , she said , ever since Miss Gracie had come to the plantation . As she walked on up the road , Toussaint called after her that he did n't know whether to finish painting the wagon or not , as Alex Cady said it was his.  | " Oh , do n't pay any attention to that white man , " cried Lucy ; " he traded that wagon to Colonel Vaiden for a coon dog . I heard all about it . " And she went on up to the manor laughing . Toussaint finished the wagon in a brilliant burst of vermilion . The passing of Lucy Lacefield had made his difficultywith Cady less menacing . There was something he could do about it . After he had finished the wagon he made shift to put a light bed on it , hitched up the mules , and drove it to the sunken pit at the back of the manor . This had once been a flower house and was lined with brick . Toussaint cut away the weeds , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As he worked his mother and Lucy came out and watched him . The two women had not stood on the edge of the old pit for many minutes before the tan girl began cleaning off the bricks and putting them in the wagon bed . There was something attractive about Lucy as she stooped and scraped and piled the bricks in the wagon . When Toussainthad first seen her in the lane he had thought of her as a mulatto . Now , as she stood on the edge of the pit , her complexion lost its suggestiveness of a negro in Toussaint 's eyes , and Lucy became a woman just like his mother , to whom the accident of color did not apply . As Lucy worked she was telling Gracie about her mother , Presh Lacefield , who had been seamstress for the Lacefields in the days of the old manor 's glory before the war . Her mother had gone to Huntsville and set up as a dressmakerright after the war . Finally she had married Luke Anders , who was a farmer , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother sometimes wished she had stayed in Huntsville , everything was so changed in the Reserve . The colored tenants of the ruinous old manor stood talkingof the old days and digging bricks out of a former flowerp330house to make a fireplace for a negro school in a deserted cotton pen . That afternoon Toussaint hauled the bricks to the field , improvised a bright red mortar out of clay , and began settingup the fireplace at the end of the pen . The roof was not a very good piece of thatching , but it was so steep that it did not leak . The seats were a bench , two or three stools , and a split-bottom chair which Lucy had brought down for herself . The blackboard was an old piece of oilcloth , and marks were made on it with pencils of blue clay which the children whittled out of the bottom of rivulets . On a large pumpkin beside the teacher 's chair was scratched a map of the world with the stein for the North Pole . Everything Lucy Lacefield did , she did rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he needed . She kept bricks to his hand and recleaned them before she laid them down . In the midst of this work she had leisure . Womanlikeshe talked to Toussaint about himself , his life in Florence , what he was going to do here on the plantation . " I tell Luke he ought to fertilize his cotton , " said the girl ; " this land 's worn out . " " You mean manure it ? " queried Toussaint . " You could n't get enough . " " No , I mean commercial fertilizers . " Toussaint did not know what she was talking about . " Where do you get that sort of fertilizer ? " " I do n't know exactly , but there is such a thing . I 've read about it in the farm papers . " " I wonder if it would make the land grow much more ? " " It says it doubles and trebles the yield , " said Lucy . The girl 's tone immediately made Toussaint want to getsome of this miraculous stuff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could get away within a year , " hazarded Toussaint . " Get away , " echoed Lucy . " Where are you and your mother going ? "  | " North , I suppose , " returned the boy , " but I had thought of going West , too . " " White people go West , " said Lucy looking at the youth , " but colored folks hardly ever do . " " Ye-es , I know that , " admitted Toussaint , thinking of his real purpose in fleeing the South . At his vague answer the girl looked at him curiously . " If you made a success here , it looks as if you 'd stay . " " Well , " said Toussaint , drawing a long breath , " colored people do n't get their rights here . My trouble with Cady , for instance : if he takes me with a warrant , I wo n't get a fair show . " " If you make a good tenant and grow lots of cotton , you 'd have a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisply . " I suppose that 's so , " admitted Toussaint . " And if you really made a success you 'd help all the colored folks around here , " persisted the tan-colored girl rapidly . " It would show people that negroes could be industriousand prosperous . It 's a responsibility to be a colored person now . A white man like Cady can do anything , and nobody will think any worse of white people for it , but if a negro does anything , everybody says , Oh , well , all negroes are like that . ' " " I wish I had n't thrown that paintbrush at Alex Cady ! " cried Toussaint . " I ought to have just let him talk . " The girl came over and touched his hand . " They tell me what is without help should be without regard , " she quoted philosophically . While the maxim was sober enough , her faint touch on his hand was pleasant to Toussaint . Just then a nasal femininevoice called : " Lucy ! Lucy ! Air you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tan-colored girl to step away from Toussaintand move to the door , where she could see who was calling her.  | " Yes , I 'm here , Miss Mamie ! " she called back . Toussaint now had the fireplace up as high as his chest and was trying to contrive how to swing in the hips of the little chimney . A white girl , a trifle younger than Lucy , came walking across the rain-flattened cotton rows . " Oh , you-all are makin ' a farplace , " she said , looking curiously at the rising structure . " Yes , the children ca n't study in the cold . " " Well , I declare , " repeated the white girl in astonishment . Lucy had an impulse to say , " Miss Cady , this is ToussaintVaiden , " but to have introduced a negro to a white girl would have been an offense . Mamie Cady stood near Lucy with an occasional curious glance at the white negro who was laying the bricks . Finallyshe said : " Lucy , would you mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the colored girl . The envelope was addressed in a copperplate handwritingwith many flourishes . The whole address was inscribed on a scroll . Above this flew a pen-drawn bird bearing the scroll in its beak . On the outstretched wings of the bird was written : " Fly away little bird and carry this letter to . , , On the scroll itself was the address : MISS SLATIE CADY , BeShears Crossroads , Lauderdale County , Alabama . Lucy drew out a letter in the same florid handwriting and looked at it . " What does it say ? " asked Mamie.  |p333Lucy  nodded faintly at Toussaint to ask if Mamie wanted the letter read before him . " Oh , yes , go ahead , " said Mamie . " DEAR MISS SLATIE , " read the tan girl , " I seat myself to write you a few lines to let you know Pap 's hawgs took the colry just as he was fixin ' to kill ' em , so he did n't , and Pap says that is the first time he ever knowed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ha !

They buried her in Mount Moriar burial groun 's . We heard about Colonel Milt Vaiden stealin ' out old man Handback . " Hopin you all is enjoying the same blessins , I am " Your cousin , " PHILO SMOTHERMAN . " The name Catlin caught Toussaint 's attention . " Are the Catlins kin to you , Miss Mamie ? " he asked . " My mammy was a Smotherman , and her great-aunt wasMiss Hepzy Smotherman who married old man Philo Catlin . That 's why Uncle Henst , Mam 's brother , named his boyPhilo , after Philo Catlin . . . . So Aunt Hepzy 's dead . " " That 's what the letter said , " nodded Lucy . " When Mammy got that letter , " said Mamie , " she was mortal shore that somebody was dead . She handed it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucy and see who 's dead . ' " The white girl stood looking at her letter for a minute or so and then said : " I do n't reckon you could learn me to write , Lucy ? " " Why , I am sure I could , " said Lucy , entering the pen and picking up a stick of blue clay . The tan girl evidently was about to begin . " What do you charge ? " asked Mamie.  | " Why , I charge ten cents a month . " " Ten cents a month , " repeated Mamie . " I could make that with eggs . . . . " This bargaining was interrupted by Alex Cady 's voice shouting : " Mamie ! Mamie ! Come away from them stuck-up yaller niggers , or I 'll skin you alive . First thing they know , I 'll pitch a pine knot into that nigger mess they 're buildin ' , and the whole shebang will go up in smoke . " Mamie 's face whitened . She turned about and started walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabin.  |p335AT  NOON the next day after his bricklaying with Lucy Lacefield , Toussaint Vaiden saddled one of the mules and rode to Florence . The octoroon was in a hurry for two reasons . That morningAlex Cady had come to the manor and demanded his wagon . Toussaint and Gracie and Lump Mowbray held a council . Lump had said that they had better not raise any more ruckus with that white man , but for Toussaint to go tell Colonel Vaiden about what had happened and see who the wagon belonged to . Another reason that spurred Toussaintwas an apprehension that a constable might ride up and take him with a warrant for what he already had done to Cady . As he urged his mule to a running walk he turned over in his mind his fight with Cady , thinking how he could put himself in the best light before the Colonel . Another reason for his rush , he wanted to get back and see how the fireplaceworked that morning . On the previous day , when he had come home to the manor and had dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old table in the kitchen and finally had said he believed he would step out that night and try to get acquainted with their neighbors . Gracie had forecast suspiciously : " Now , Toussaint , you 're going to Luke Anders ' house to see Lucy Lacefield again . " Toussaint had become very uncomfortable . " I thought I 'd go by all the cabins , " he protested , " except that white man 's , and see everybody . " This second time Toussaint had seen Lucy the fact thatp336she was a tan girl and not so white as he vanished completelyfrom his mind . Lucy 's mother , Presh Lacefield , had told Toussaint at once that Lucy had had a year in a colored school in Nashville , that she was a Christian girl and was trying to see how much good she could do . " Her only fault is , she 's too good , " declared Presh , " they put a lot of foolishness in her head up there in Nashville , which I do n't suppose I would take out if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody else any good . " Toussaint saw that Presh was extremely proud of her daughter , and this was her way of boasting about her , to decry her . It was the old Lacefield way of boasting . Presh had been a house servant in the manor before the war and the modes of speech among the old white aristocrats were Presh 's modes . Presh reminded Toussaint somewhat of his mother , but Gracie held a pensive sweetness to her son that was almost mysterious . He never knew of what she was thinking , whereas , after his first five minutes with Presh , he never knew anything except what Presh was thinking . Toussaint had come away from the Anders ' cabin at midnight with an uncomfortablecertainty that his mother would disapprove of his long stay . When the white negro reached Florence he hitched his . mule on one of the back streets and approached Colonel Vaiden 's store as inconspicuously as possible . He was still afraid of being arrested for his assault on a white man . The Colonel 's store was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Bradley had shown to Miltiades in the first instance . No amount of subsequent looking had found another building for Miltiades . It was the worst store in Florence actually to be in use . Its theoretical rental had been seventeen dollars a month , but the Colonel had got it for eight silver dollars piled in a stack before Bradley 's eyes . " This is a hell of a department store I 'm leasing you , "  |p337said  the real-estate dealer , and he felt that the Colonel had got several of his best cigars under false pretenses . Toussaint entered a building that was absolutely unlightedfrom one end to the other except by a front and a back door . A large brass lamp hung from the middle of the ceiling , but lamps were designed for the night and not the day , so it was unlighted . Toussaint stood in the doorway , blinking his eyes and seeingnothing . From the interior Miltiades asked without enthusiasm : " Do you want anything , Toussaint ? " " I 'd like to speak with you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Miltiades instantly perceived that his tenant was in trouble . " What have you done now ? " he asked in a voice that suggested that Toussaint was always running to him with some difficulty . " Is anybody here ? " " No . " " Well . . . I . . . I had a little trouble . " " Yes , I know that . " " You heard about it ? " ejaculated Toussaint , in alarm . " No . " " Well . . . Mr. Alex Cady come and took his wagon back . " " You mean the one I let you have ? " snapped the Colonel . " Yes , sir . " " Why , the little runt ! " ejaculated the Colonel , annoyed . " I gave him eleven dollars for that wagon . You tell him that . Tell him I told you to tell him , and for him to give that wagon back to you . " Toussaint was disconcerted at this message . " I 'd rather not tell him myself , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Have you already had a fight with him about it ? " asked the Colonel sharply.  | The white negro stood silent . " What did you do it for ? " demanded the Colonel . " You knew I 'd get the wagon back for you , or you should have known it . What did you want to start a fight for ? " " It was n't for the wagon . . . " stammered Toussaint . " What was it for ? " " He called my mother a bad name . " " Oh . . . and he took the wagon after that ? " " Yes , sir . " " What did you do to make him call your mother a bad name ? " " Well , he was cutting up some posts in one of the stalls for stove wood , and I told him to stop . " " I see , " nodded Miltiades . The Colonel wondered if this were the truth . He always doubted a negro . But it was a reasonable explanation . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their houses rather than get out and cut their own firewood in cold weather . He had expected this . He had figured it in the price he had paid for the old Lacefield place . " Were you wanting to use the posts for firewood yourself ? " he asked Toussaint almost whimsically . The octoroon grew warm . " I had just come back with a load of wood from the hills , " he replied , " when Mother told me she heard a hammering down at the stable . I went down to see , and when Cady denied cutting the posts I told him Mother had heard him hammering , and that 's why he called her a name . " " M-m . . . is that all your trouble ? " " Then I threw a paintbrush at him and smeared his face , and I thought he might get out a warrant for me . " " I see , " nodded Miltiades . " If he does , let me know . " " All right , sir , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added the Colonel reflectively , " you . . . you ought n't to raise trouble with a white man just offhand like that . "  | " I know I ought n't , " said the youth in a monotone . The Colonel did n't exactly like the way he said this , so he dropped the subject . " Is there anything you are going to have to have on the farm ? " he asked in a negative voice . The white man 's invitation not to purchase anything recalledto the youth what Lucy Lacefield had said . " Colonel , " he began tentatively , without much hope , " I  --  I 've been thinking about something for the plantation . . . . " " All right . . . what is it ? " inquired the Colonel in a discouragingtone . " Well . . . it 's ferterlizer , " said Toussaint . " Fertilizer ! " Toussaint nodded vaguely . " You mean you want me to get you sonic manure from somewhere ? " Toussaint really did not know what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not manure . You call it commercial ferterlizer . I think it comes in bags . " Miltiades was astonished . " Where did you get such a notion in your head , nigger ? " " I  --  I just heard about it , " stammered Toussaint . " They say it makes more cotton . " " Well , I be damned ! " ejaculated the merchant . IIe himself had heard of commercial fertilizers , but he had never seen any . Now , for one of his negroes to pop up and ask for commercial fertilizer ! " How much do you think you would need ? " he inquired . " They say . . . about twenty-two pounds an acre . " " Well . . . we 'll see about that . . . if I can get it andit , does n't cost too much . But , look here , if I do get some I'llput it down against your account ! " " Oh , yes , that 's all right , " cried Toussaint , delighted at this half promise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store , thinking over such an extraordinary request from a negro . It was as if a baby should display an interest in higher mathematics . Then he thought of Beekman again , whom he supposed to be Toussaint 's father . That explained the white negro 's initiative , and also his tendency to get himself into trouble with anybody who crossed him . P341IT WAS five o'clock , and Colonel Miltiades Vaiden locked his store and started for his home . Other businesses in town kept open longer , but his trade came from the country , and by five o'clock all of his customers were out of town . As Miltiades crossed Courthouse Square he was disappointed in his heart about his store . He had meant to found a large , handsome store , but he had reproduced , almost automatically , Handback 's store , BeShears ' store , and a thousand other stores throughout the South . The real object of the darkness and uninvitingness of all these stores was to discourage trade . The less merchandise the negro tenants bought , the greater profit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the storekeeper arranged his goods not to sell . He specialized in unattractiveness . But all this was precisely the opposite of what the Colonel had in mind when he embarked upon his enterprise . At first Miltiades thought his establishment in CourthouseSquare was a temporary affair , and that later he would found a dignified mercantile establishment . But the store that he had started expanded swiftly . IIe accepted more and more first mortgages . He had even foreclosed one of these mortgages and now had another plantation on his hands . Then a debtor had given Miltiades what purported to be a first mortgage on his place , but which later had turned out to be a second mortgage . The Colonel had been forced to buy in the first to make his second good . This deal had set him back about thirty-five hundred dollars . He could , of course , have sent the man who made such false representations to the coal mines , but then he wouldP342have had a plantation on his hands that was completely idle . The Colonel had given the fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , he saw his dream of a fine business vanishing because all his money was being tied up in this gloomy little hole on the Square . So the Colonel walked home through the cold dusk with a number of disagreeable things in his head . And then the people he passed on the streets gave him a bare , " Goodevening , Colonel Vaiden , " or did not speak at all . Not that he gave a damn for that . He had enough to think of , God knew , without worrying about whether the people in Florence liked him or not . They never had liked him , but since the Handback episodetheir attitude toward him had changed from silent indifference to silent distrust and condemnation . It was queer how different could be the emotional content of two silences . . . in folk walking past without a word . A few days before this an odd break had occurred in Miltiades ' isolation . On the corner of Pine and Laurel streets some workmen were laying the foundation of a brick church . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The hole in the ground with its stone foundations for the walls and partitions caught the Colonel 's fancy and suddenly put him in mind of the fact that , as yet , he had started no mansion of his own . The Colonel wanted some such magnificent home . He wanted it to escape the turmoil of his tenants , the ugliness of his store , and the silence of his acquaintances . Of course , he could n't get it now , because he had too little money . But when his circumstances eased up he was going to build himself a home that was a home . As Miltiades stood looking at the foundation , a man in a long black coat came up Laurel Street , and he too stopped and began looking at the foundation . The Colonel knew the man . He was a Reverend B. Alyin Puckett , minister of the congregation who were building the new church . Miltiades could see the Reverend PuckettP343glance at him from time to time . Presently the minister took open notice of Miltiades and came around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Vaiden , " he said , offering his hand . " I am Puckett , the preacher in charge of this congregation . I have been intending to call on you , Colonel , but you know how it is , a minister never has a minute of his own . " Miltiades returned the preacher 's hand rather blankly . " I suppose you are kept busy , " he agreed , wondering what a minister did with the week-days . " So I 'm very glad to meet you now and here , " paeaned the divine . The thought crossed Miltiades ' mind to say drily , " You form a minority of one , " but instead of that he said he was pleased to meet him , too . " I 'm glad to see you take an interest in our prospective building , " went on Puckett with enthusiasm . " Now , this is going to be the vestry , there the robing room for the choir . The organ is going to be situated yonder , at the end of the nave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a gold cross in the center . . . . What do you think of lighting the building with acetylene ? " Miltiades answered vaguely that acetylene jets gave a nice light . " Could you make some suggestion about the lighting ? " inquired the Reverend Puckett earnestly . " Well . . . " said Miltiades , thinking of possible ways to light a church , " you might have ' em hanging from the ceil-ing . " " A good idea , " nodded Puckett , " the ceiling is going to he arched ; middle Gothic . The acetylene plant will cost about two hundred and fifty dollars . Dr. Simpson the druggist suggested fifty dollars . Judge Ashton suggested seventyfive . I thought it would be nice for just three men to arrange tine lighting of the church . You know how nice such reports look when you hand them in at conference , just three names making up the amount . Gives such a generous character toP344the congregation . So much more so than a number of names with small contributions . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While the fellow talked , Miltiades had been mentally adding what already had been suggested and subtracting the sum from what might be called the superior limit of suggestibility , and he arrived at the amount of one hundred and twenty-five dollars as a field for further suggestions as to how the acetylene lights should be arranged in the new church . The dry humor of the situation appealed to the Colonel . He reflected again that he was thirty-five hundred dollars short . But the great advantage of having a full-bodied shortageis that small extravagances have no influence on it . " I believe I 'll suggest fifty dollars , " said Miltiades . " I hate to put you to the trouble of finding another man , but I just happen to have fifty dollars in my pocket " ; and to the Reverend Puckett 's amazement the Colonel drew out a long purse and handed him four tens and two fives . After that Miltiades did not get away for a good hour . The Reverend Puckett discoursed on the generosity of the Florence people , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Methodist congregation would have no need to be ashamed to meet their God in . In brief , he kept Miltiades so long that the Colonel regretted having given him anything , at all . He ruined his begging with his gratitude . The Reverend Puckett himself was thinking piously : " Who knows but what this may be the thief on the Cross , turning his eyes toward his Saviour ? " To Miltiades his contribution of fifty dollars had no meaningat all beyond his brush of dry humor in giving it and his boredom with Puckett after he had given it . But when the report of his donation got abroad at the next meeting of the Methodist deacons , gossip was muc more ingenious than that . The malevolent said it was con science money . The ambitious said Colonel Vaiden was tr ing to buy his way into respectable society again . The vp345said he was trying to make a splurge on what he had stolen . One or two of the kind-hearted believed the Colonel was trying to put himself right with God . Miss Sydna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things said about Colonel Vaiden , he was still the magnanimous Christian gentleman . Tears came to her eyes when she heard of it . It was so like the chivalrous knight who had comforted her dying father on the battlefield even after her father had cost the Colonel his love . The point that really stuck in Miltiades ' mind after his contribution was the manor which the bare foundations of the church had suggested . So now , today , as he walked up Pine Street , he was thinkingthat for all the edification he was getting out of his money he might as well be J. Handback and have done with it . He had no store ; he had no manor ; he had no liberal and cultivating amusements , nor was he a patron of the arts . He pursued none of the post bellum graces of life , and for all he was getting out of his money , he might just as well be Handback , or his father-in-law Alex BeShears , or any other of the ten thousand money grubbers in the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had transferredthe ownership of the cotton from Handback to himself it was a sort of moral duty for him to use it at least with more enlightenment than Handback had been doing . At the moment the Colonel was passing Bill Bradley 's residence on Pine Street . An impulse moved him to step in and ask Bradley what a two-and-a-half-story brick house of fifteen or twenty rooms would cost . Not that he meant to buy or build such a structure : he wanted to know what it %mild cost . Bradley , the purveyor of magnificent homes , lived in a single-story wooden house that needed paint . It would continue to need paint . Mrs. Bradley refused to let Bill paint ww house or clip the lawn or do anything at all to the out- side of the place , because , she said , if he did so , he would sell it . Mrs. Bradley had lived in dozens of houses in Florence which she had fixed up and which Bill had sold . She told her friends that Bill would sell her last shimmy at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spot , if anybody made him an offer . She said she liked her Pine Street home , and she was determined to keep it if she had to let it rot down on her head . Mr. Bill Bradley answered the Colonel 's bell . He appeared in the hallway with one eye slightly closed out of habit , although at the moment he was not smoking . Bill was surprised to see the Colonel . He knew that he was the only man in town who had been friendly toward Miltiades , but he did not consider that his friendliness had gone far enough to warrant the Colonel in calling on him at his home . If it had gone that far , it had slipped out from under his control . So now , with a trace of surprise in his manner , he asked the Colonel into the living room , as there was no fire in his parlor . Miltiades , who read Bradley 's unwillingness , said no , he would n't go in at all , he had just stopped by to get an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's arm . " Nonsense ! Nonsense ! " he cried . " Come on in to the fire . Me and Lily was just wondering why you did n't come around sometimes . Lily , here 's Colonel Vaiden come to see us . See if you ca n't trot out some of that blackberry wine your mother sent us . Colonel , my mother-in-law makes the best blackberry wine you ever put in your face . Now , what kind of an estimate are you looking for , Colonel ? " " Now , look here , " explained Miltiades , trying to put everything straight , " I want you to know here and now that I am not going to buy anything . I just want an estimate . " " Colonel , " cried the real-estate dealer , " I 'm the very manp347you 're looking for . I have n't got a thing in the world I want to sell you . " Mrs. Bradley began laughing . " Colonel Vaiden , " she said , " when Bill does n't want to sell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book and start paying him for it . " With the uncommercial aspect of this investigation thoroughlybefore them , Mr. Bradley ran through an expertcatechism as to the sort of house Miltiades did not want . " Is it that department store idea again ? " he inquired . " No , a dwelling house . I simply want an estimate . " The real-estate dealer turned to his wife . " Listen to that , Lily , this old fox is thinking about marryingagain . " " No , not at all , " said Miltiades , with a widower 's soberness . " You 'd say that anyway , " coquetted Lily , lifting a brow at the Colonel . " All right , " re-began Bradley in a business tone . " Do you know any house in this town of the sort you want ? " " I was thinking of building to suit myself . " The real-estate dealer drew a long face . " Do n't try that . You 'll suit nobody else in the world and finally not even yourself . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advised Mrs. Bradley archly ; " and remember , she 'll want plenty of closets . " " Go ahead and tell me what you want , " advised Bradley . The Colonel pondered . He could explain neither to the Bradleys nor to himself that he wanted a spiritual retreat from the commercial mechanism into which he was falling . Ile not only could not explain this , but the Bradleys were so conjugal that it was impossible , in their presence , to think of a manor being put to any other use than for an uxurious n-arried couple to live in . P348So the Colonel began on what already had crystallized in his mind : an old brick manor with green jalousies , a colonnadedpiazza , an observatory on top ; and he went on describingthe sort of manor one saw anywhere in the South . Bill looked at his wife . " Very unusual , Lily , ai n't it ? " " Very , " nodded Lily earnestly ; " only he has n't mentioned closets . " Bradley got to his feet . " Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to ourselves . If we do n't , Lily will turn your house into one huge collection of closets . " Miltiades arose with a touch of regret at leaving this hearth with a pleasant woman beside it . It was like going out of a warm room into the cold again . He followed Bradley to the door . Outside , the night had grown quite dark . The moment they were out of the presence of Lily their talk lost its undercurrent of deference and humor and became more flat-footed . " A house like you 've been talking about will cost you around fifty thousand dollars , new , " said Bradley . " That 's what I wanted to know . " " But , look here , damn it , I can sell you the same damn house , already put up , for a third of that price . " " Sixteen and two thirds , " calculated the Colonel . " I 'll say fifteen in round figgers . " " But it wo n't be what I want , " declared the Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't be what you want ? " They had reached Bradley 's gate . The real-estate dealerremembered something else he had to tell his client , so hewalked on with him . " The rest of them deeds , Handback swears he give ' em to me . " " Well , it does n't make much difference anyway . " " No , but when I sell you a place I want you to be able to show a clear title to it in your safe . " " Do n't worry about it . "  | " I 'm not worrying , but I like to do business in a business way . " The two men were talking about the old deeds to the Lacefield place . The whole collection was transferred to each new purchaser of the plantation . They were a formidable pile that derived title from the original Indian grants . While the two men discussed the old deeds which should have been delivered to Miltiades , Bradley paused , opened a gate , and headed the Colonel into it . The real-estate man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , saying you just want anestimate . . . inside of twelve months you 'll be ready tobuy . " " What makes you think so ? " " Because by that time the Administration will be on its feet , ever'thing will be moving . . . . Did I tell you about a order for a site for a fertilizer factory ? " This made the Colonel think of Toussaint . " Yes , you told me about that . . . . Where are we go-ing ? " Miltiades discovered that he was walking up a circular graveled path between borders of box . Bradley stopped with a full-armed gesture toward the dark mass of a manor . " What 's the matter with that ? " he demanded with the mechanical but glowing commendation of a salesman . " Matter with what ? " " Why , the Crowninshield place ? " Miltiades saw where he was and became rather embarrassed . " I do n't know what 's the matter with it . " " Does it suit your needs ? " " Aw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " it is n't for sale . " " Make me an offer for half what it 's worth , and it 's yours , " said Bradley in earnest tones . " I know who owns this house . I do n't mean who holds the deeds , I mean who actually owns the house , " P350 The Colonel became incensed at being dragged onto Drusilla'slawn and offered such a nefarious bargain . " I would n't buy it the way you 're talking about for fifteen cents ! " " Well . . . it would cost you more than that , even my way , " said Bradley , evidently laughing . " Bradley , I do n't appreciate this , " said the Colonel severely . " M-m . . . it 's business . " " You know the owner of this place does n't want to sell ! " " Of course not . . . they never do . . . . But the man with the mortgage always wants to sell , and usually does , sooner or later . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know . " " What 's his rush ? " " Why , with this financial depression coming on us , gold dollars are going to be worth their weight in gold , I can tell you . " " I thought you expected flush times . You got a commission to buy a site for a fertilizer plant . " " Hell fire , that order was canceled two weeks ago  --  by telegraph . No , sir , this property is going to be foreclosed , Colonel , and if you do n't buy it some damned skinflint will , and Miss Drusilla will be turned out of her home . " At this moment the door of the manor opened , and a youth and a girl appeared against the light in the hallway . They lingered for a moment , after the fashion of the young , when the girl probably saw the coal of Bradley 's cigar , for she said in a startled undertone : " Jerry , there 's somebody out in the yard ! " " Out where ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bradley in the casual tone of a neighbor . " I was just showing a prospect your house to see if it was anything like what he wanted . " " Mr. Bradley , you 're not going to sell him our place ! " called Sydna in apprehension . Bradley broke into a laugh .   " How could I sell your mammy 's own property if she did n't want me tS ? " The couple on the porch hesitated a moment . " Who is your prospect ? " asked Sydna . " Colonel Milt Vaiden . " Sydna gave a little gasp . She felt as if a violin string had been twanged in her chest . " Come on up . You-all ca n't tell anything about our house in the dark . " " M-m . . . we might make a guess what it weighed , maybe , " replied Bradley . The two men walked up the ample wooden steps . " Come in , " invited Sydna . " Jerry , you bring me that book the next time you come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " we have n't time to come in , Miss Sydna , I was just passing by . . . . " " All right , " said Jerry 's voice , " I wo n't forget it . " He passed the men on the piazza and said , " Good-night , Uncle Milt . Good-night , Mr. Bradley . " " Good-night , Jerry , " returned the uncle . " Jerry , I hear they 're about to kick you out of school again , " called the real-estate man cheerfully . " What 's the matter this time ? " " Not having any brains , " returned Jerry just as cheerfully . " That 's the only reason they 'd ever kick you out , Jerry  --  because they have n't got any brains . Now , Colonel , you 're in better hands than mine to see this house . I 'll walk to the gate with Jerry . " " I meant I did n't have any brains , " said Jerry , waiting for the real-estate man . " Oh , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , Jerry . " Sydna was peering at the Colonel in the light from the doorway . " Really , wo n't you come in , Colonel Vaiden ? " she invited , in some excitement .   Miltiades was disconcerted that Bradley had got him into such a situation . He thought sharply to himself , if he ever did buy anything at all , it would n't be from Bradley . " I wish I could , Miss Sydna , but I have n't time . I was not making a call . " " I know you are not , " caught up the girl ; " you never do , but I see you go past every day . " " I really do n't call much anywhere , Miss Sydna , " defendedMiltiades inexpertly . " I know it , but you ca n't do that way , Colonel , " protestedSydna . " You and Mother are such old friends , it looks as if . . . " " Well , yes . . . I suppose I ought . . . Drusilla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enigmatic complicationof their two lives , their changing relations to each other , until now he stood on her lawn in the darkness , with a real-estate dealer , planning to foreclose the mortgage against her home . . . . " There really is n't much to say , Sydna , " he concluded grayly . " Why , I think there is everything to say , " pressed the girl , with the anxious excitement of a person who faces suddenly a long desired and solitary opportunity . " We were talking about you the other day . . . giving the lighting system to the Methodist church . I hope you 'll remember the Episcopalians too , some time . " She had not at all meant to switch off onto this topic . It had come by accident . " You belong to your mother 's church ? " " Oh , all the Lacefields are Episcopalians . " " Well , " said Miltiades more lightly , " if the Episcopals start a new church , they can rely on me to give them light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , look here , wo n't you really come in and see Mother ? You ca n't come up on her porch like this and then go away ! " She was in earnest ; in fact , she sounded on the verge of tears . She forced Miltiades into seriousness again.  | " I do n't think your mother would like to see me , Sydna , " said the Colonel . " I 'll run ask her . " " Sydna ! " cried the Colonel , shocked at the idea . " Well , then , how am I ever going to get to see you myself ? " asked the girl . " Do you want to see me ? " inquired the Colonel incredulously . " Why , of course . " " What for ? " " Why , to thank you . " " Me ? " " Yes , you know that night at the political speaking , " she lowered her voice , " when you corrected Mr. Handback . . . " The Colonel had a bad moment when he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that she was calling Lucius Mr. Handback . " You forgot what you said to him ! " cried Sydna reproachfully . " I 'm afraid I have . " " You said , even if he was n't a gentleman , he should act like one , or something like that . . . . It squelched him . " The Colonel was slightly amused . " If you liked it , I am very happy to have done you that service . " " As if that were all the services you 've done me , " said Sydna , shaking her head . " I hope I can do more , " said the Colonel , extending his hand . " But , look , you really are coming back to see Mother ? " " If she should give me some assurance that she would like for me to come , " suggested Miltiades . " I 'll see that she does that , " exclaimed Sydna . At that moment an interior door opened , and a voice called : " Sydna darling , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honey ? "  | " I 'm talking to Colonel Vaiden , Mother , " Sydna triumphantly and expectantly . Came a pause ; then Drusilla 's voice said : " Oh ! " And the interior door was shut. called backP355For several days , on the strength of Sydna 's suggestion hat her mother would see him , Colonel Miltiades Vaiden pondered writing a note , asking permission to call at the Crowninshield home . But the impulse somehow held within itself a queer unrealizable feeling , and so it was delayed and delayed . Then the pre-Christmas rush set in and eddied even into the store on the wrong side of Courthouse Square , and Miltiades had no time for social amenities . Two weeks later Christmas day came and put an abrupt end to all trading whatsoever . The only customers left in town during the holiday were the small boys who had exhausted their supply of firecrackersand roman candles . As Miltiades did not handle fireworks , he sat on a stool at the bookkeeper 's desk quite alone . He turned through the accounts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But instead of putting his mind on his business he thought that it was Christmas , that Drusilla Crowninshield had her home decorated , that Rose probably had fixed up her boarding house . . . . He wondered what his sister Cassandra was doing . . . very likely teaching Buck Mosely 's brood of pickaninnies that Santa Claus was a myth . The fancy of his old maid sister doing this gave Miltiades a sort of sad amusement . Presently other members of his family floated into his t Noughts : his brother Sylvester in Arkansas and Lycurgus in Louisiana . Ponny always wrote a semi-annual letter to Ilie wives of these two brothers , and now it occurred to him that unless he took up the correspondence himself he would likely hear from them no more.  |p356The  Colonel reached for his pen and paper , but when he got them together he had nothing to say . Where Ponny would have thought of pages full of news , the Colonel could think of nothing at all . Then , as he sat there , dipping his pen from time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably his brothers ' families would not care to hear from him . If the report of the Handback affair had reached their ears , very likely they would not appreciate a letter from . . . He did not finish his thought but simply let it drop . Then he began writing : DEAR MRS . CROWNINSHIELD : The writer would greatly appreciate the honor of calling on you and your family at any time today that is convenient for you . With my greatest respect and best wishes of the season , MILTIADES VAIDEN . Christmas Day . The Colonel looked at his handiwork , which he certainly had not set out to write . He put it in an envelope and walked to the door with an idea of finding a negro to take it . The Square outside was empty of black folk . From here and there came the report of giant crackers . A church bell was ringing . The Colonel stood in his door with note in hand when he saw young Dalrymple Love strolling toward his store . The clerk wore his Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wearing his best clothes and moving aimlessly along the street , the clerk produced , somehow , an acute impression of loneliness . When he came up to Miltiades he touched his hat . " Good-morning , Colonel . I hope you had a good trade this Christmas . " " Fair enough , and I hope you did , too . " " It might have been better , " said Love ; he paused aP357moment and then added , " I 'm leaving Mr. Handback on the first . " Miltiades was quite surprised . " Got a better place ? " " Have n't got no place at all . " He hesitated a little uncomfortably . " The fact is I thought I 'd walk down this way and see if you did n't need a clerk . You know what I can do . You 've seen me clerk . " " How came that ? " asked the Colonel . " Well , Mr. Handback is gettin ' rid of a lot more of his places . . . our trade 's fell off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whoever buys the places , so nachelly he do n't need as many clerks as he used to need . " " M-m . . . I see , " nodded Miltiades . As he said it a gust of acquisitiveness went through the Colonel . If Handback were selling more of his farms they must be going cheap indeed , and Miltiades began silently counting up his resources to see if he could purchase another . " What are you doing for Christmas ? " he asked of Love , passing over the boy 's inquiry about a job . " Why , nothing much . The saloons are shut up , and me and Stebbins ca n't get in to play pool nowhere . " " Why do n't you go to see your girls ? " Love turned his forward foot on its heel and said : " Huh , I ai n't got no girl . " " What are you doing now ? " inquired the Colonel . " Why-y . . . Lucius give me a note and a dime and told me to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm a dad gum mind to tear it up . " " Why ? " " I 'm not Lucius ' erran ' boy . " " Well , I would n't tear it up . " " I do n't see no nigger . I think they are all over at a big to-do in East Florence . " " Who 's the note to ? " " Oh , that Crowninshiel ' girl , " said Love in distaste ; " stuck-up city girl . "  |p358Across  the Colonel 's mind floated a contempt for Lucius , dangling after Sydna . Aloud he said : " By the way , Love , if you decide to go over there and take the note yourself , I have one to  --  er  --  to Mrs. Crown-inshield . " " I 'll take yours , " announced Love at once , with some reference possibly to the fact that he had applied to the Colonel for a job . " That 's nice of you . You can bring back my answer here , if you do n't mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . " Mr. Dalrymple Love took the Colonel 's note and started across Courthouse Square toward the entrance of Pine Street . He was still rather hopelessly on the lookout for a negro . He did not want to enter the Crowninshield home as an errand boy . Then he tried to think of something to do after he had delivered the notes and come back with the answers . He looked at the corner saloon on the north side of the Square , where he and Stebbins might have played pool all day long had not the place , unhappily , been closed on this , their single holiday . Across the town other church bells were ringing out the glad occasion of Christmas . A notion came to Love that next Christmas he and Stebbins would rent a saloon and shut themselves up inside and play pool all day long . As he walked along , his imagination added other enjoyable details . He and Stebbins would take a couple of cans of cove oysters and plenty of pepper sauce and crackers , and they would have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time . He could fancy himself chewing a bite of canned oysters and crackers , chalking his cue , and deliberating over how to shoot a combination . The church bells rang out charity , peace , and good-will to all men . Love walked along planning a gay , delightful Christmas twelve months distant from this lonely day . Angling across the Square , Love saw a party of three going to the courthouse : Judge Ashton , a negro girl , andP359what at first appeared to be a white boy , but a second glance showed it was the white negro who had lived in East Florence . The white negro promised relief from the ignominy of delivering the note at the Crowninshield home , and Dalrymple went striding across the Square , calling : " Oh , nigger ! Say there , nigger ! I want you to deliver a note ! " The blond negro looked at Dalrymple through the cold sunshine . " I ca n't , Mr. Love , " he excused himself , " I 'm going with Judge Ashton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Why , hell , you 're already there . Come along and take this note , there 's a dime in it . " " You 'll have to excuse me this time , " demurred Toussaint . " I 'll be damn ' if I do ! " cried Love . " You 're the only nigger left . All the rest are over at East Florence at some sort of nigger to-do . " " But we are going there too , just as soon as we get through with Judge Ashton , Mr. Love . " " I be damn ' if you do . Now , you can run up to the Crowninshield place with a couple of notes ; then you cango " Judge Ashton intervened to say he would have to see the two negroes in the courthouse first , and then they could do what they pleased . So Dalrymple went in with them and stood on the cold porch until the Judge and the negroes had finished their business inside . When the white negro and the tan girl came out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes and a dime . Run on up to The white negro interrupted in a kind of taut monotone : " I 'm sorry , but we 've just got to get to East Florence . " Dalrymple Love , in a hillman 's fury , cursed them for being a couple of damned unaccommodating yellow polecats . After this outburst he said more soberly and reproach-fully : " This is a nice howdy-do for Christmas , when everybody 's supposed to be nice and friendly . . . refusing to take a Christmas note . " And the tan girl said in a low tone : " You have n't helped our Christmas much , either , Mr. Love . " The white negro shushed her and said : " Come along . . . . Do n't say anything to him . " Mr. Dalrymple Love delivered his two notes at the Crowninshield home on Pine Street and returned one answer to Colonel Vaiden and the other to Lucius Handback at the Handback store . With the latter answer he offered Lucius his dime with the observation that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow stuck-up devil that ought to be shot . Lucius said keep the dime for a Christmas present , and the country boy said , " Hell , I do n't want any Christmas present for taking a note , " and flung the dime on the floor . Lucius read his note and became angry in his turn . He glanced at the silver piece on the floor and snapped out : " All right , sweep it out in the morning , " and he went to a show case and replaced a tie which he had taken out . The country boy 's wrath at the negro served him in lieu of any other Christmas entertainment . He found some pleasure in thinking how he would like to kick that nigger from one side of Courthouse Square to the other . The white nigger was uppety , he supposed , to show off before the nigger wench . . . and he 'd like to kick her from one side of Courthouse Square to the other , also . However , here he was , deprived of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nowhere to go , and his job coming to an end on New Year 's Day . . . . The litany of Mr. Love 's woes was interrupted by a veryp361extraordinary spectacle . Down the steps from the upper story came a short compact figure in a new stiff hunting coat . He wore ordinary trousers , but his legs were cased up to the knees in cheap canvas leggins . He carried a long breechloading shotgun in his hand , and his coat bore the imprint of a box of shells . Dalrymple stared at the figure in the utmost amazement . " Mr. Handback ! " he ejaculated at length , " what in the world are you going to do ? " " What does it look like I 'm going to do ? " asked Handback . " Why  --  why , it looks like you 're goin ' a-huntin ' ! " " That 's right , I am . I 'm taking a day off " ; and he laughed at the stupefaction written in his clerk 's face . From the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you rigging up for a costume ball ? " " I 'm going hunting , " repeated the merchant ; " I 'm going rabbit-hunting . " " Well , I be danged ! " cried Dalrymple in amazement . " Imagine , the boss going rabbit-hunting . . . . Look here , I believe I 'll go with you ! " " Come on , if you 've got any way to go . " " What way do I need ? " " You 'll need a horse . I 'm going to ride out in the country a piece . I would n't have gone if Lucius had n't got turned down by his girl . He wo n't need the mare now , and I just thought I 'd go . " " If I 'd dreamed you 'd gone hunting I would n't have written the note in the first place , Dad . " " Well , that 's pretty rice of you , Lucius , you 're a pretty nice sort of son , is n't he , Love ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit more heart , " Yes , there are lots worse fellows than Lucius . " " A whole lot worse , " said the father . The huntsman went back to the bookkeeper 's enclosure and began fiddling with his books , putting things away in his safe . He called to Lucius :  | " Tell your maw I wo n't be home to dinner . " " All right . " He continued with his papers for several minutes and presently called again : " By the way , here are them deeds Bill Bradley ought to have . He swore up and down I never give ' em to him , and sure enough he was right . Now , do n't forgit that , Lucius , you and Love . " " I wo n't , " promised Love , and the papers passed out of his mind even as he promised to remember them . The merchant squatted on his heels looking into his safe for a minute or two longer . Then he closed it and walked forward behind the dry-goods counter to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love thought . Then he went on to the door with his gun . " Not going with me , Love ? " he inquired . " No , sir , I have n't got no horse . " " Well . . . Merry Christmas to both of you boys . " " Same to you , Mr. Handback . " " Merry Christmas to you , Dad . "  | THE Handback mare was hitched to a post in an alley by the side of the store . In the cold sunshine her hair looked a little unkempt . She shied around at the odd sight of her owner in hunting clothes , but presently stood and allowed the inexpert horseman to bestride her saddle . J. Handback got himself set , feet in stirrups , gun balanced inside the pommel of his saddle , and moved his mount carefully into the street . He looked back , saw Love and his son standing in the door of the store laughing at him . He waved awkwardly and rode on . J. Handback was in better spirits than lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruined . All that he owned he would be forced to sell in these depressed times , and still it would not pay what he owed . Now that he saw this and agreed with it ; now that he had quit struggling mentally for some combination that would pull him through the crisis , he felt better . He had the limp , restful feeling of a man when a long and violent fever suddenly leaves him . The motion of the mare beneath him was vaguely pleasant . He thought , if he saw a rabbit on his way to the place where he was going , he might find a kind of Christmas pleasure in killing it . His thoughts hung around his catastrophe , no longer as frenzied rescuers working in a wreck , but as spectators viewinga ruin , reconstructing its fall , pondering what might have been done , but with no thought of doing anything . That which had taken the last breath of hope from the merchant was a very odd thing which had no financial connectionat all with his affairs . Several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board of deacons of the Methodist church , of which he was a member . He had heard his minister , the Reverend B. Alvin Puckett , make the announcement that Colonel Miltiades Vaiden had contributed fifty dollars toward the lighting fund of their new church . The minister went on to say that he and all of his deacons hoped that this gift to the church betokened a man who was right with his Maker . Then the Reverend Puckett had placed all the contributionshe had received on a table in the assembly room , and had lowered his head , and in a few well chosen words had asked God 's blessing on the gifts and the givers . When that happened Handback somehow became certain that he would never pull through his difficulties . He knew that Colonel Miltiades Vaiden was going up , and he had an irrational conviction that he was going down . He and the Colonel seemed to be counterpoises balanced fatally against each other . But now , as the merchant rode along , a little coal of happiness kindled and burned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was on the road to the home of his runawaymistress . When he had started from town he was not quite sure that he was going to Gracie , but as he rode forward in his hunting coat and leggins , his destination grew upon him . An increasing haste filled his mind . He visualized the different points on the road before he reached them . He could see BeShears ' store , the Reserve road , the old Lacefieldmanor , long before he reached them , but he could not see Gracie . He peered about the old place for her in his thoughts ; physically he was urging his mare to a faster gait . In the course of time the merchant really came in sight of the weathered brick house with its peeling colonnade . Around its ancient observatory the wrought-iron grilles were twisted and broken away in places . It was like an advertisement of the indignities suffered by the ancient manor of the Lacefields . There was no Gracie at the gate , and the merchant wasP365touched by a fear that she had gone away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , as Gracie seldom associated with negroes . The merchant was rememberingthis last fact hopefully when his attention was caught by a very small , queer structure in a field . It looked like a large child 's playhouse with a tall thatched roof and a miniature chimney . He wondered what the thing could be , then went on to the manor , stepping his horse over the scattered stone fence and riding around behind the old pile where the mare would be out of sight from the road . He lowered his gun , got down carefully , and looped his bridle over the end of a pole in the woodpile . As he turned toward the house he heard a gasp , and a woman 's voice breathed : " For God 's sakes  --  Mr. Handback ! " Gracie stood , a picturesque figure , in the doorway of the kitchen . She had resurrected from somewhere a black lace dress and a red lace shawl , and there were brilliants in her hair . Her dramatic eyes stared at the man from a colorless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing . " That  --  that 's you , is n't it , Gracie ? " " Y-yes , sir , Mr. Handback . " " Is there anybody in . . . are you expecting anybody , Gracie ? " he asked , with disappointment and a twinge of jealousy in his voice . " No , sir , Mr. Handback . " The merchant stood looking at her for a minute or two , and then with a kind of start picked up his catechism again . " Then what are you so dressed up for ? " " It 's . . . Christmas . " Gracie glanced down at herself . " I did n't know you had any such clothes as that , " said the merchant a little curiously .
