Only last week did news come from Port-au-Prince , Haiti to the world of a battle that in any country nearer a cable office would have made headlines . <P> French-speaking , Negro Haiti with an area of 10,204 sq . mi. has a population ( 2,550,000 ) almost twice that of Spanish-speaking , mainly Mestizo Dominican Republic , area 19,332 sq . mi . For years , overcrowded Haitians have been slipping over the border , squatting on Dominican land . Fortnight ago the border villages blazed with fire and the banging of musketry . When the smoke cleared , over 300 were dead on Dominican soil , mostly Haitian squatters , their wives and children . Nervous authorities in both countries feared reprisals .
