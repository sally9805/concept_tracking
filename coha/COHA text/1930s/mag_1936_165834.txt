Two pianos struck the keynote simply from a darkened theatre pit one afternoon last week . On a stage bare of properties the current dance season began in Manhattan , not with the Monte Carlo Ballet Russe of glamorous traditions and virtuoso performers , not with any of the U. S. moderns struggling to express themselves by gymnastic abstractions , but with performances designed by Kurt Jooss , a 35-year-old German whose ballets , scorning any set technique , tell stories . <P> Three years have passed since the Jooss dancers first visited the U. S. , failed financially in spite of the indelible impression left by The Green Table , a scathing satire on the men who promote war ( TIME , Nov. 13 , 1933 ) . Last winter the Jooss group staged its comeback , thanks in part to the booming interest in ballet . This year its tour will extend to the Pacific Coast , later on to the Orient . <P> The Green Table remains the best of the Jooss ballets , wears well as a masterpiece . In it ten of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finally furious . With foolish toy pistols they start the war through which Death stalks , imperiously destroying soldiers and their womenfolk , pecking fatally at a cocky little profiteer , sparing only the diplomats , inscrutably masked , back at the green table again making more trouble . <P> With most critics The Mirror finds favor as a portrayal of post-War confusion , reaching its climax when Dancer Elsa Kahl , as a laborer 's wife , discards her drab clothes to join the women of the streets . With frothy moods Choreographer Jooss is less successful . A Ball in Old Vienna is only tritely pretty . Johann Strauss , Tonight ! is a cluttered potpourri which does little more than show that Elsa Kahl can turn a cartwheel . <P> In The Big City a pale-faced street crowd jigs automatically to the twangy jazz rhythms of Alexandre Tansman 's Transatlantique , an accompaniment which makes Dancer Hans Zuellig seem all the more lonely when he loses his girl to a silk-hatted libertine .

Result was not another Green Table , but a ballet with spots that were powerful , spots that were not . The sirens Pescht meets on his philanderings contribute little to the modern dance . On the other hand , his homecoming is deeply moving , from the time he drags himself in , ragged and exhausted , to the final scene when he rejoins his parents and with slow , swinging , monotonous steps suggests his resignation to the drudgery from which he had tried to escape . <P> Every Jooss ballet is the creation of the man who gave the troupe its name . Son of a farmer who kept a brewery on the side , Kurt Jooss was expected to go through a general schooling , return to the soil . He rebelled . At school he was moody , more interested in the piano and taking pictures . For a time he struggled with farming , but after one session with Rudolf von @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years with the eccentric who inspired Mary Wigman and many another of the modernistic school .
