From Hyde Park to Chicago went President Roosevelt on a moment 's notice last week to defend his $300,000,000 cut in veterans ' pensions before the 15th annual convention of the American Legion . His friends advised him not to make the trip because : 1 ) resentful legionaries who had borne the brunt of his Economy Act might subject him to an indignity ; 2 ) letters had turned up in the White House mail " daring " him to show his face at the convention ; 3 ) Chicago was such a notoriously bad city in which to guard a President that none had visited it since the early days of the Coolidge administration . Brushing all such objections aside the President ordered a special train and departed on his first sally into the Midwest since his election . <P> The Legion gave him an uproariously warm welcome . Donning an overseas cap to show his membership in the organization , he stepped up amid a cyclone of cheers to the same Stadium rostrum where 15 months prior he had accepted the Presidential nomination . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an audience of 30,000 . He drew loud laughter when he interjected : " My , you 're a young looking bunch . ' ' National credit based on national unity was the theme of his speech . In defense of his pension cuts he declared : <P> " We laid down two principles which directly affected benefits to veterans-that the Government has a responsibility for and toward those who suffered injury or contracted disease while serving in their country 's defense ; that no person , because he wore a uniform , must thereafter be placed in a special class of beneficiaries over and above all other citizens . The fact of wearing a uniform does not mean that he should receive a pension because of a disability incurred after his service . . . . <P> To carry out these principles will not bankrupt your Government . It is my hope that in so far as justice concerns those whose disabilities are , as a matter of fact , of War service origin , the Government will be able to extend even more generous care than is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veterans to whom disability and sickness unconnected with War service has come . . . . Only if his own community and his own state are unable to care for him . then and then only should the Federal Government offer him hospitalization and care . " <P> The Legion accepted this Roosevelt doctrine with good grace . It realized that its demands for prepayment of the Bonus and an over-generous pension policy had caused it to lose caste . Now , in its own words , it was out to " resell itself to the country " as a good citizen . <P> In Manhattan where he spent the night at his town house the President gave a farewell family dinner for his son James who , with his wife , sailed at midnight on S. S. Europa for a European vacation .
