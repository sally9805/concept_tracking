Nick 's is an American place : a San Francisco water-front honky-tonk . At a table , JOE : always calm , always quiet , always thinking , always eager , always bored , always superior . His expensive clothes are casually and youthfully worn and give him an almost boyish appearance . He is thinking . Behind the bar , NICK : a big red-headed young Italian-American with an enormous naked woman tattooed in red on the inside of his right arm . He is studying The Racing Form . The ARAB , at his place at the end of the bar . He is a lean old man with a rather ferocious old-country mustache , with the ends twisted up . Between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand is the Mohammedan tattoo indicating that he has been to Mecca . He is sipping a glass of beer . It is about eleven-thirty in the morning . SAM is sweeping out . We see only his back . He disappears into the kitchen . The SAILOR at the bar finishes his drink and leaves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discover how to live . The NEWSBOY comes in . NEWSBOY ( Cheerfully ) Good-morning , everybody . ( No answer . To NICK ) Paper , Mister ? NICK shakes his head , no . The NEWSBOY goes to JOE.Paper , Mister ? JOE shakes his head , no . The NEWSBOY walks away , counting papers . p. 3 JOE ( Noticing him ) How many you got ? NEWSBOY Five . JOE gives him a quarter , takes all the papers , glances at the headlines with irritation , throws them away . The NEWSBOY watches carefully , then goes . ARAB ( Picks up paper , looks at headlines , shakes head as if rejecting everything else a man might say about the world ) No foundation . All the way down the line . The DRUNK comes in . Walks to the telephone , looks for a nickel in the chute , sits down at JOE 'S table . NICK takes the DRUNK out . The DRUNK returns .

He is a very young man , not more than twenty . He is wearing heavy shoes , a pair of old and dirty corduroys , a light green turtle-neck jersey with a large letter " F " on the chest , an oversize two-button tweed coat , and a green hat , with the brim up . NICK sets out a glass of beer for him , he drinks it , straightens up vigorously , saying Aaah , makes a solemn face , gives NICK a one-finger salute of adieu , and begins to leave , refreshed and restored in spirit . He walks by the marble game , halts suddenly , turns , studies the contraption , gestures as if to say , Oh , no . Turns to go , stops , returns to the machine , studies it , takes a handful of small coins out of his pants pocket , lifts a nickel , indicates with a gesture , One game , no more . Puts the nickel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interesting noise . p. 4 NICK You ca n't beat that machine . FAROUGHLI Oh , yeah ? The marbles fall , roll , and take their place . He pushes down the lever , placing one marble in position . Takes a very deep breath , walks in a small circle , excited at the beginning of great drama . Stands straight and pious before the contest . Himself vs. the machine . Willie vs . Destiny . His skill and daring vs. the cunning and trickery of the novelty industry of America , and the whole challenging world . He is the last of the American pioneers , with nothing more to fight but the machine , with no other reward than lights going on and off , and six nickels for one . Before him is the last champion , the machine . He is the last challenger , the young man with nothing to do in the world . WILLIE grips the knob delicately , studies the situation carefully , draws the knob back , holds it a moment , and then releases it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contest is on . At the very beginning of the play " The Missouri Waltz " is coming from the phonograph . The music ends here . This is the signal for the beginning of the play . JOE suddenly comes out of his reverie . He whistles the way people do who are calling a cab that 's about a block away , only he does it quietly . WILLIE turns around , but JOE gestures for him to return to his work . NICK looks up from The Racing Form . p. 5 JOE ( Calling ) Tom . ( To himself ) Where the hell is he , every time I need him ? ( He looks around calmly : the nickel-in-the-slot phonograph in the corner ; the open public telephone ; the stage ; the marble-game ; the bar ; and so on . He calls again , this time very loud ) Hey , Tom . NICK ( With morning irritation ) What do you want ? JOE ( Without thinking ) I want the boy to get me a watermelon , that 's what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love , or fame , or what ? You wo n't get them studying The Racing Form . NICK I like to keep abreast of the times . TOM comes hurrying in . He is a great big man of about thirty or so who appears to be much younger because of the childlike expression of his face : handsome , dumb , innocent , troubled , and a little bewildered by everything . He is obviously adult in years , but it seems as if by all rights he should still be a boy . He is defensive as clumsy , self-conscious , overgrown boys are . He is wearing a flashy cheap suit . JOE leans back and studies him with casual disapproval . TOM slackens his pace and becomes clumsy and embarrassed , waiting for the bawling-out he 's pretty sure he 's going to get . p. 6 JOE ( Objectively , severely , but a little amused ) Who saved your life ? TOM ( Sincerely ) You did , Joe . Thanks . JOE ( Interested ) How 'd I do it ? TOM ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How 'd I do it ? TOM Joe , you know how you did it . JOE ( Softly ) I want you to answer me . How 'd I save your life ? I 've forgotten . TOM ( Remembering , with a big sorrowful smile ) You made me eat all that chicken soup three years ago when I was sick and hungry . JOE ( Fascinated ) Chicken soup ? TOM ( Eagerly ) Yeah . JOE Three years ? Is it that long ? TOM ( Delighted to have the information ) Yeah , sure . 1937. 1938. 1939 . This is 1939 , Joe . p. 7 JOE ( Amused ) Never mind what year it is . Tell me the whole story . TOM You took me to the doctor . You gave me money for food and clothes , and paid my room rent . Aw , Joe , you know all the different things you did . JOE nods , turning away from TOM after each question . JOE You in good health now ? TOM Yeah , Joe . JOE You got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three times a day . Sometimes four ? TOM Yeah , Joe . Sometimes five . JOE You got a place to sleep ? TOM Yeah , Joe . JOE nods . Pauses . Studies TOM carefully . JOE Then , where the hell have you been ? TOM ( Humbly ) Joe , I was out in the street listening to the boys . They 're talking about the trouble down here on the waterfront . JOE ( Sharply ) I want you to be around when I need you . p. 8 TOM ( Pleased that the bawling-out is over ) I wo n't do it again . Joe , one guy out there says there 's got to be a revolution before anything will ever be all right . JOE ( Impatient ) I know all about it . Now , here . Take this money . Go up to the Emporium . You know where the Emporium is ? TOM Yeah , sure , Joe . JOE All right . Take the elevator and go up to the fourth floor . Walk around to the back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars ' worth of toys and bring them here . TOM ( Amazed ) Toys ? What kind of toys , Joe ? JOE Any kind of toys . Little ones that I can put on this table . TOM What do you want toys for , Joe ? JOE ( Mildly angry ) What ? TOM All right , all right . You do n't have to get sore at everything . What 'll people think , a big guy like me buying toys ? JOE What people ? TOM Aw , Joe , you 're always making me do crazy things for you , and I 'm the guy that gets embarrassed . You just sit in this place and make me do all the dirty work . p. 9 JOE ( Looking away ) Do what I tell you . TOM O.K. , but I wish I knew why . He makes to go . JOE Wait a minute . Here 's a nickel . Put it in the phonograph.Number seven . I want to hear that waltz again . TOM Boy , I 'm glad I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what do you hear in that song anyway ? We listen to that song ten times a day . Why ca n't we hear number six , or two , or nine ? There are a lot of other numbers . JOE ( Emphatically ) Put the nickel in the phonograph . ( Pause ) Sit down and wait till the music 's over . Then go get me some toys . TOM O.K. O.K. JOE ( Loudly ) Never mind being a martyr about it either . The cause is n't worth it . TOM puts the nickel into the machine , with a ritual of impatient and efficient movement which plainly shows his lack of sympathy or enthusiasm . His manner also reveals , however , that his lack of sympathy is spurious and exaggerated . Actually , he is fascinated by the music , but is so confused by it that he pretends he dislikes it . The music begins . It is another variation of " The Missouri Waltz , " played dreamily and softly , with perfect orchestral form , and with a theme of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At first TOM listens with something close to irritation , since he ca n't understand what is so attractive in the music to JOE , and what is so painful and confusing in it to himself . Very soon , however , he is carried away by the melancholy story of grief and nostalgia of the song . He stands , troubled by the poetry and confusion in himself . JOE , on the other hand , listens as if he were not listening , indifferent and unmoved . What he 's interested in is TOM . He turns and glances at TOM . KITTY DUVAL , who lives in a room in The New York Hotel , around the corner , comes beyond the swinging doors quietly , and walks slowly to the bar , her reality and rhythm a perfect accompaniment to the sorrowful American music , which is her music , as it is Tom 's . Which the world drove out of her , putting in its place brokenness and all manner of spiritually crippled forms . She seems to understand this , and is angry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , and full of pity and contempt for its tragic , unbelievable , confounded people . She is a small powerful girl , with that kind of delicate and rugged beauty which no circumstance of evil or ugly reality can destroy . This beauty is that element of the immortal which is in the seed of good and common people , and which is kept alive in some of the female of our kind , no matter how accidentally or pointlessly they may have entered the world . KITTY DUVAL is somebody . There is an angry purity , and a fierce pride , in her . In her stance , and way of walking , there is grace and arrogance . JOE recognizes her as a great person immediately . She goes to the bar . p. 10 DUVAL Beer . NICK places a glass of beer before her mechanically . She swallows half the drink , and listens to the music again . TOM turns and sees her . He becomes dead to everything in the world but her . He stands like a lump , fascinated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notices TOM . JOE ( Gently ) TOM TOM begins to move toward the bar , where KITTY is standing . ( Loudly ) TOM TOM halts , then turns , and JOE motions to him to come over to the table . TOM goes over . ( Quietly ) Have you got everything straight ? TOM ( Out of the world ) What ? JOE What do you mean , what ? I just gave you some instructions . TOM ( Pathetically ) What do you want , Joe ? JOE I want you to come to your senses . He stands up quietly and knocks Tom 's hat off . TOM picks up his hat quickly . TOM I got it , Joe . I got it . The Emporium . Fourth floor . In the back . The toy department . Two dollars ' worth of toys . That you can put on a table . p. 11 DUVAL ( To herself ) Who the hell is he to push a big man like that around ? JOE I 'll expect you back in a half hour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you . TOM ( Pleading ) Joe ? Ca n't I bet four bits on a horse race ? There 's a long shot  --  Precious Time  --  that 's going to win by ten lengths . I got to have money . JOE points to the street . TOM goes out . NICK is combing his hair , looking in the mirror . NICK I thought you wanted him to get you a watermelon . JOE I forgot . ( He watches KITTY a moment . To KITTY , clearly , slowly , with great compassion ) What 's the dream ? DUVAL ( Moving to JOE , coming to ) What ? JOE ( Holding the dream for her ) What 's the dream , now ? DUVAL ( Coming still closer ) What dream ? JOE What dream ! The dream you 're dreaming . NICK Suppose he did bring you a watermelon ? What the hell would you do with it ? p. 12 JOE ( Irritated ) I 'd put it on this table . I 'd look at it . Then I 'd eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , sell it for a profit ? NICK How should I know what you 'd do with anything ? What I 'd like to know is , where do you get your money from ? What work do you do ? JOE ( Looking at KITTY ) Bring us a bottle of champagne . DUVAL Champagne ? JOE ( Simply ) Would you rather have something else ? DUVAL What 's the big idea ? JOE I thought you might like some champagne . I myself am very fond of it . DUVAL Yeah , but what 's the big idea ? You ca n't push me around . JOE ( Gently but severely ) It 's not in my nature to be unkind to another human being . I have only contempt for wit . Otherwise I might say something obvious , therefore cruel , and perhaps untrue . DUVAL You be careful what you think about me . JOE ( Slowly , not looking at her ) I have only the noblest thoughts for both your person , and your spirit . p. 13 NICK ( Having listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are you talking about ? DUVAL You shut up . You  --  JOE He owns this place . He 's an important man . All kinds of people come to him looking for work . Comedians . Singers . Dancers . DUVAL I do n't care . He ca n't call me names . NICK All right , sister . I know how it is with a two-dollar whore in the morning . DUVAL ( Furiously ) Do n't you dare call me names . I used to be in burlesque . NICK If you were ever in burlesque , I used to be Charlie Chaplin . DUVAL ( Angry and a little pathetic ) I was in burlesque . I played the burlesque circuit from coast to coast . I 've had flowers sent to me by European royalty . I 've had dinner with young men of wealth and social position . NICK You 're dreaming . DUVAL ( To JOE ) I was in burlesque . Kitty Duval . That was my name . Lifesize photographs of me in costume in front of burlesque theaters all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I believe you . Have some champagne . NICK ( Going to table , with champagne bottle and glasses ) There he goes again . JOE Miss Duval ? DUVAL ( Sincerely , going over ) That 's not my real name . That 's my stage name . JOE I 'll call you by your stage name . NICK ( Pouring ) All right , sister , make up your mind . Are you going to have champagne with him , or not ? JOE Pour the lady some wine . NICK O.K. , Professor . Why you come to this joint instead of one of the high-class dumps uptown is more than I can understand . Why do n't you have champagne at the St. Francis ? Why do n't you drink with a lady ? DUVAL ( Furiously ) Do n't you call me names  --  you dentist . JOE Dentist ? NICK ( Amazed , loudly ) What kind of cussing is that ? ( Pause . Looking at KITTY , then at JOE , bewildered ) This guy does n't belong here . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all the time . ( To KITTY ) Do n't think you 're the only one he drinks champagne with . He drinks with all of them . ( Pause ) He 's crazy . Or something . p. 15 JOE ( Confidentially ) Nick , I think you 're going to be all right in a couple of centuries . NICK I 'm sorry , I do n't understand your English . JOE lifts his glass . KITTY slowly lifts hers , not quite sure of what 's going on . JOE ( Sincerely ) To the spirit , Kitty Duval . DUVAL ( Beginning to understand , and very grateful , looking at him ) Thank you . They drink . JOE ( Calling ) Nick . NICK Yeah ? JOE Would you mind putting a nickel in the machine again ? Number  --  NICK Seven . I know . I know . I do n't mind at all , Your Highness , although , personally , I 'm not a lover of music . ( Going to the machine ) As a matter of fact I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ever hear of Tchaikowsky ? NICK He was a dope . JOE Yeah . Why ? p. 16 NICK They talked about him on the radio one Sunday morning . He was a sucker . He let a woman drive him crazy . JOE I see . NICK I stood behind that bar listening to the God damn stuff and cried like a baby . None but the lonely heart ! He was a dope . JOE What made you cry ? NICK What ? JOE ( Sternly ) What made you cry , Nick ? NICK ( Angry with himself ) I do n't know . JOE I 've been underestimating you , Nick . Play number seven . NICK They get everybody worked up . They give everybody stuff they should n't have . NICK puts the nickel into the machine and the Waltz begins again . He listens to the music . Then studies The Racing Form . DUVAL ( To herself , dreaming ) I like champagne , and everything that goes with it . Big houses with big porches , and big rooms with big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flowers growing everywhere , and big shepherd dogs sleeping in the shade . NICK I 'm going next door to Frankie 's to make a bet . I 'll be right back . p. 17 JOE Make one for me . NICK ( Going to JOE ) Who do you like ? JOE ( Giving him money ) Precious Time . NICK Ten dollars ? Across the board ? JOE No . On the nose . NICK O.K. ( He goes ) DUDLEY R. BOSTWICK , as he calls himself , breaks through the swinging doors , and practically flings himself upon the open telephone beside the phonograph . DUDLEY is a young man of about twenty-four or twenty-five , ordinary and yet extraordinary . He is smallish , as the saying is , neatly dressed in bargain clothes , over-worked and irritated by the routine and dullness and monotony of his life , apparently nobody and nothing , but in reality a great personality . The swindled young man . Educated , but without the least real understanding . A brave , dumb , salmon-spirit struggling for life in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind which has been only irritated by what it has been taught . He is a great personality because , against all these handicaps , what he wants is simple and basic : a woman . This urgent and violent need , common yet miraculous enough in itself , considering the unhappy environment of the animal , is the force which elevates him from nothingness to greatness . A ridiculous greatness , but in the nature of things beautiful to behold . All that he has been taught , and everything he believes , is phony , and yet he himself is real , almost super-real , because of this indestructible force in himself . His face is ridiculous . His personal rhythm is tense and jittery . His speech is shrill and violent . His gestures are wild . His ego is disjointed and epileptic . And yet deeply he possesses the same wholeness of spirit , and directness of energy , that is in all species of animals . There is little innate or cultivated spirit in him , but there is no absence of innocent animal force . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has a chance , as a person , and believes it . As a matter of fact , he has n't a chance in the world , and should have been told by somebody , or should not have had his natural and valuable ignorance spoiled by education , ruining an otherwise perfectly good and charming member of the human race . At the telephone he immediately begins to dial furiously , hesitates , changes his mind , stops dialing , hangs up furiously , and suddenly begins again . Not more than half a minute after the firecracker arrival of DUDLEY R. BOSTWICK , occurs the polka-and-waltz arrival of HARRY . HARRY is another story . He comes in timidly , turning about uncertainly , awkward , out of place everywhere , embarrassed and encumbered by the contemporary costume , sick at heart , but determined to fit in somewhere . His arrival constitutes a dance . His clothes do n't fit . The pants are a little too large . The coat , which does n't match , is also a little too large , and loose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas . A philosophy , in fact . His philosophy is simple and beautiful . The world is sorrowful . The world needs laughter . HARRY is funny . The world needs HARRY . HARRY will make the world laugh . He has probably had a year or two of high school . He has also listened to the boys at the pool room . He 's looking for Nick . He goes to the ARAB , and says , Are you Nick ? The ARAB shakes his head . He stands at the bar , waiting . He waits very busily . p. 18 HARRY ( As NICK returns ) You Nick ? NICK ( Very loudly ) I am Nick . HARRY ( Acting ) Can you use a great comedian ? NICK ( Behind the bar ) Who , for instance ? HARRY ( Almost angry ) Me . NICK You ? What 's funny about you ? DUDLEY at the telephone , is dialing . Because of some defect in the apparatus the dialing is very loud . DUDLEY Hello . Sunset 7349 ? May I speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With spirit and noise , dancing ) I dance and do gags and stuff . NICK In costume ? Or are you wearing your costume ? DUDLEY All I need is a cigar . DUVAL ( Continuing the dream of grace ) I 'd walk out of the house , and stand on the porch , and look at the trees , and smell the flowers , and run across the lawn , and lie down under a tree , and read a book . ( Pause ) A book of poems , maybe . p. 19 DUDLEY ( Very , very clearly ) Elsie Mandelspiegel . ( Impatiently ) She has a room on the fourth floor . She 's a nurse at the Southern Pacific Hospital . Elsie Mandelspiegel . She works at night . Elsie . Yes . He begins waiting again . WESLEY , a colored boy , comes to the bar and stands near HARRY , waiting . NICK Beer ? WESLEY No , sir . I 'd like to talk to you . NICK ( To HARRY ) All right . Get funny . HARRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actor with great energy , both in power of voice , and in force and speed of physical gesture ) Now , I 'm standing on the corner of Third and Market . I 'm looking around . I 'm figuring it out . There it is . Right in front of me . The whole city . The whole world . People going by . They 're going somewhere . I do n't know where , but they 're going . I ai n't going anywhere . Where the hell can you go ? I 'm figuring it out . All right , I 'm a citizen . A fat guy bumps his stomach into the face of an old lady . They were in a hurry . Fat and old . They bumped . Boom . I do n't know . It may mean war . War . Germany . England . Russia . I do n't know for sure . ( Loudly , dramatically , he salutes , about faces , presents arms , aims , and fires ) WAAAAAR . He blows a call to arms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that HARRY should hold it , and goes to WESLEY . p. 20 NICK What 's on your mind ? WESLEY ( Confused ) Well  --  NICK Come on . Speak up . Are you hungry , or what ? WESLEY Honest to God , I ai n't hungry . All I want is a job . I do n't want no charity . NICK Well , what can you do , and how good are you ? WESLEY I can run errands , clean up , wash dishes , anything . DUDLEY ( On the telephone , very eagerly ) Elsie ? Elsie , this is Dudley . Elsie , I 'll jump in the bay if you do n't marry me . Life is n't worth living without you . I ca n't sleep . I ca n't think of anything but you . All the time . Day and night and night and day . Elsie , I love you . I love you . What ? ( Burning up ) Is this Sunset 7-3-4-9 ? ( Pause ) 7943 ? ( Calmly , while WILLIE begins making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Lorene ? Lorene Smith ? I thought you were Elsie Mandelspiegel . What ? Dudley . Yeah . Dudley R. Bostwick . Yeah . R. It stands for Raoul , but I never spell it out . I 'm pleased to meet you , too . What ? There 's a lot of noise around here . WILLIE stops hitting the marble-game.Where am I ? At Nick 's , on Pacific Street . I work at the S. P. I told them I was sick and they gave me the afternoon off . Wait a minute . I 'll ask them . I 'd like to meet you , too . Sure . I 'll ask them . ( Turns around to NICK ) What 's this address ? p. 21 NICK Number 3 Pacific Street , you cad . DUDLEY Cad ? You do n't know how I 've been suffering on account of Elsie . I take things too ceremoniously . I 've got to be more lackadaisical . ( Into telephone ) Hello , Elenore ? I mean , Lorene . It 's number 3 Pacific Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How 'll you know me ? You 'll know me . I 'll recognize you Good-by , now . ( He hangs up ) HARRY ( Continuing his monologue with gestures , movements , and so on ) I 'm standing there . I did n't do anything to anybody . Why should I be a soldier ? ( Sincerely , insanely ) BOOOOOOOOOM . WAR ! O.K. War . I retreat . I hate war . I move to Sacramento . NICK ( Shouting ) All right , Comedian . Lay off a minute . HARRY ( Broken-hearted , going to WILLIE ) Nobody 's got a sense of humor any more . The world 's dying for comedy like never before , but nobody knows how to laugh . NICK ( To WESLEY ) Do you belong to the union ? WESLEY What union ? p. 22 NICK For the love of Mike , where 've you been ? Do n't you know you ca n't come into a place and ask for a job and get one and go to work , just like that . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WESLEY I did n't know . I got to have a job . Real soon . NICK Well , you 've got to belong to a union . WESLEY I do n't want any favors . All I want is a chance to earn a living . NICK Go on into the kitchen and tell Sam to give you some lunch . WESLEY Honest , I ai n't hungry . DUDLEY ( Shouting ) What I 've gone through for Elsie . HARRY I 've got all kinds of funny ideas in my head to help make the world happy again . NICK ( Holding WESLEY ) No , he is n't hungry . WESLEY almost faints from hunger . NICK catches him just in time . The ARAB and NICK go off with WESLEY into the kitchen . HARRY ( To WILJIE ) See if you think this is funny . It 's my own idea . I created this dance myself . It comes after the monologue . HARRY begins to dance . WILLIE watches a moment , and then goes back to the game . It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but much energy . p. 23 DUDLEY Elsie Aw , gee , Elsie . What the hell do I want to see Lorene Smith for ? Some girl I do n't know . JOE and KITTY have been drinking in silence . There is no sound now except the soft shoe shuffling of HARRY , the Comedian . JOE What 's the dream now , Kitty Duval ? DUVAL ( Dreaming the words and pictures ) I dream of home . Christ , I always dream of home . I 've no home . I 've no place . But I always dream of all of us together again . We had a farm in Ohio . There was nothing good about it . It was always sad . There was always trouble . But I always dream about it as if I could go back and Papa would be there and Mamma and Louie and my little brother Stephen and my sister Mary . I 'm Polish . Duval ! My name is n't Duval , it 's Koranovsky . Katerina Koranovsky . We lost everything . The house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cows , the chickens . Papa died . He was old . He was thirteen years older than Mamma . We moved to Chicago . We tried to work . We tried to stay together . Louie got in trouble . The fellows he was with killed him for something . I do n't know what . Stephen ran away from home . Seventeen years old . I do n't know where he is . Then Mamma died . ( Pause ) What 's the dream ? I dream of home . NICK comes out of the kitchen with WESLEY . p. 24 NICK Here . Sit down here and rest . That 'll hold you for a while . Why did n't you tell me you were hungry ? You all right now ? WESLEY ( Sitting down in the chair at the piano ) Yes , I am . Thank you . I did n't know I was that hungry . NICK Fine . ( To HARRY who is dancing ) Hey . What the hell do you think you 're doing ? HARRY ( Stopping ) That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comedian . WESLEY begins slowly , one note , one chord at a time , to play the piano . NICK You 're no good . Why do n't you try some other kind of work ? Why do n't you get a job in a store , selling something ? What do you want to be a comedian for ? HARRY I 've got something for the world and they have n't got sense enough to let me give it to them . Nobody knows me . DUDLEY Elsie . Now I 'm waiting for some dame I 've never seen before . Lorene Smith . Never saw her in my life . Just happened to get the wrong number . She turns on the personality , and I 'm a cooked Indian . Give me a beer , please . HARRY Nick , you 've got to see my act . It 's the greatest thing of its kind in America . All I want is a chance . No salary to begin . Let me try it out tonight . If I do n't wow ' em , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't dead , a guy like me would have a chance . p. 25 NICK You 're not funny . You 're a sad young punk . What the hell do you want to try to be funny for ? You 'll break everybody 's heart . What 's there for you to be funny about ? You 've been poor all your life , have n't you ? HARRY I 've been poor all right , but do n't forget that some things count more than some other things . NICK What counts more , for instance , than what else , for instance ? HARRY Talent , for instance , counts more than money , for instance , that 's what , and I 've got talent . I get new ideas night and day . Everything comes natural to me . I 've got style , but it 'll take me a little time to round it out . That 's all . By now WESLEY is playing something of his own which is very good and out of the world . He plays about half a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watching ) I run the lousiest dive in Frisco , and a guy arrives and makes me stock up with champagne . The whores come in and holler at me that they 're ladies . Talent comes in and begs me for a chance to show itself . Even society people come here once in a while . I do n't know what for . Maybe it 's liquor . Maybe it 's the location . Maybe it 's my personality . Maybe it 's the crazy personality of the joint . The old honky-tonk . ( Pause ) Maybe they ca n't feel at home anywhere else . By now WESLEY is really playing , and HARRY is going through a new routine . DUDLEY grows sadder and sadder . p. 26 DUVAL Please dance with me . JOE ( Loudly ) I never learned to dance . DUVAL Anybody can dance . Just hold me in your arms . JOE I 'm very fond of you . I 'm sorry . I ca n't dance . I wish to God I could . DUVAL Oh , please . JOE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KITTY dances alone . TOM comes in with a package . He sees KITTY and goes ga-ga again . He comes out of the trance and puts the bundle on the table in front of JOE . JOE ( Taking the package ) What 'd you get ? TOM Two dollars ' worth of toys . That 's what you sent me for . The girl asked me what I wanted with toys . I did n't know what to tell her . ( He stares at KITTY , then back at JOE ) Joe ? I 've got to have some money . After all you 've done for me , I 'll do anything in the world for you , but , Joe , you got to give me some money once in a while . JOE What do you want it for ?

TOM ( Worshiping the name Kitty Duval , helplessly ) Joe , can I tell you something ? JOE ( He brings out a toy and winds it ) You do n't have to . I know . You love her . You really love her . I 'm not blind . I know . But take care of yourself . Do n't get sick that way again . NICK ( Looking at and listening to WESLEY with amazement ) Comes in here and wants to be a dish-washer . Faints from hunger . And then sits down and plays better than Heifetz . JOE Heifetz plays the violin . NICK All right , do n't get careful . He 's good , ai n't he ? TOM ( To KITTY ) Kitty . p. 28 JOE ( He lets the toy go , loudly ) Do n't talk . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar , watching everything . HARRY is dancing . DUDLEY is grieving into his beer . LORENE SMITH , about thirty-seven , very overbearing and funny-looking , comes to the bar . NICK What 'll it be , lady ? SMITH ( Looking about and scaring all the young men ) I 'm looking for the young man I talked to on the telephone . Dudley R. Bostwick . DUDLEY ( Jumping , running to her , stopping , shocked ) Dudley R. ( Slowly ) Bostwick ? Oh , yeah . He left here ten minutes ago . You mean Dudley Bostwick , that poor man on crutches ? SMITH Crutches ? DUDLEY Yeah . Dudley Bostwick . That 's what he said his name was . He said to tell you not to wait . SMITH Well . ( She begins to go , turns around ) Are you sure you 're not Dudley Bostwick ? DUDLEY Who  --  me ? ( Grandly ) My name is Roger Tenefrancia . I 'm a French-Canadian . I never saw the poor fellow before . p. 29 SMITH It seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the telephone . DUDLEY A coincidence . An accident . A quirk of fate . One of those things . Dismiss the thought . That poor cripple hobbled out of here ten minutes ago . SMITH He said he was going to commit suicide . I only wanted to be of help . ( She goes ) DUDLEY Be of help ? What kind of help could she be , of ? DUDLEY runs to the telephone in the corner.Gee whiz , Elsie . Gee whiz . I 'll never leave you again . He turns the pages of a little address book.Why do I always forget the number ? I 've tried to get her on the phone a hundred times this week and I still forget the number . She wo n't come to the phone , but I keep trying anyway . She 's out . She 's not in . She 's working . I get the wrong number . Everything goes haywire . I ca n't sleep . ( Defiantly ) She 'll come to the phone one of these days . If there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the phone . Sunset 7349 . He dials the number , as JOE goes on studying the toys . They are one big mechanical toy , whistles , and a music box . JOE blows into the whistles , quickly , by way of getting casually acquainted with them . TOM and KITTY stop dancing . TOM stares at her . p. 30 DUDLEY Hello . Is this Sunset 7349 ? May I speak to Elsie ? Yes . ( Emphatically , and bitterly ) No , this is not Dudley Bostwick . This is Roger Tenefrancia of Montreal , Canada . I 'm a childhood friend of Miss Mandelspiegel . We went to kindergarten together . ( Hand over phone ) God damn it . ( Into phone ) Yes . I 'll wait , thank you . TOM I love you . DUVAL You want to go to my room ? ( TOM ca n't answer ) Have you got two dollars ? TOM ( Shaking his head with confusion ) I 've got five dollars , but I love you . DUVAL ( Looking at him ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . They go . JOE watches . Goes back to the toy . JOE Where 's that longshoreman , McCarthy ? NICK He 'll be around . JOE What do you think he 'll have to say today ? NICK Plenty , as usual . I 'm going next door to see who won that third race at Laurel . p. 31 JOE Precious Time won it . NICK That 's what you think . ( He goes ) JOE ( To himself ) A horse named McCarthy is running in the sixth race today . DUDLEY ( On the phone ) Hello . Hello , Elsie ? Elsie ? ( His voice weakens ; also his limbs ) My God . She 's come to the phone . Elsie , I 'm at Nick 's on Pacific Street . You 've got to come here and talk to me . Hello . Hello , Elsie ? ( Amazed ) Did she hang up ? Or was I disconnected ? He hangs up and goes to bar . WESLEY is still playing the piano . HARRY is still dancing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching it work . NICK returns . NICK ( Watching the toy ) Say . That 's some gadget . JOE How much did I win ? NICK How do you know you won ? JOE Do n't be silly . He said Precious Time was going to win by ten lengths , did n't he ? He 's in love , is n't he ? NICK O.K. I do n't know why , but Precious Time won . You got eighty for ten . How do you do it ? p. 32 JOE ( Roaring ) Faith . Faith . How 'd he win ? NICK By a nose . Look him up in The Racing Form . The slowest , the cheapest , the worst horse in the race , and the worse jockey . What 's the matter with my luck ? JOE How much did you lose ? NICK Fifty cents . JOE You should never gamble . NICK Why not ? JOE You always bet fifty cents . You 've got no more faith than a flea , that 's why . HARRY ( Shouting ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really busy now , all legs and arms . NICK ( Turning and watching ) Not bad . Hang around . You can wait table . ( To WESLEY ) Hey . Wesley . Can you play that again tonight ? WESLEY ( Turning , but still playing the piano ) I do n't know for sure , Mr. Nick . I can play something . NICK Good . You hang around , too . He goes behind the bar . The atmosphere is now one of warm , natural , American ease ; every man innocent and good ; each doing what he believes he should do , or what he must do . There is deep American navet and faith in the behavior of each person . No one is competing with anyone else . No one hates anyone else . Every man is living , and letting live . Each man is following his destiny as he feels it should be followed ; or is abandoning it as he feels it must , by now , be abandoned ; or is forgetting it for the moment as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious , there is unmistakable smiling and humor in the scene ; a sense of the human body and spirit emerging from the world-imposed state of stress and fretfulness , fear and awkwardness , to the more natural state of casualness and grace . Each person belongs to the environment , in his own person , as himself : WESLEY is playing better than ever . HARRY is hoofing better than ever . NICK is behind the bar shining glasses , JOE is smiling at the toy and studying it . DUDLEY , although still troubled , is at least calm now and full of melancholy poise . WILLIE , at the marble-game , is happy . The ARAB is deep in his memories , where he wants to be . Into this scene and atmosphere comes BLICK . BLICK is the sort of human being you dislike at sight . He is no different from anybody else physically . His face is an ordinary face . There is nothing obviously wrong with him , and yet you know that it is impossible , even by the most generous expansion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is the strong man without strength  --  strong only among the weak  --  the weakling who uses force on the weaker . BLICK enters casually , as if he were a customer , and immediately HARRY begins slowing down . p. 33 BLICK ( Oily , and with mock-friendliness ) Hello , Nick . NICK ( Stopping his work and leaning across the bar ) What do you want to come here for ? You 're too big a man for a little honky-tonk . BLICK ( Flattered ) Now , Nick . NICK Important people never come here . Here . Have a drink . ( Whiskey bottle ) BLICK Thanks , I do n't drink . NICK ( Drinking the drink himself ) Well , why do n't you ? BLICK I have responsibilities . NICK You 're head of the lousy Vice Squad . There 's no vice here . BLICK ( Sharply ) Street-walkers are working out of this place . NICK ( Angry ) What do you want ? BLICK ( Loudly ) I just want you to know that it 's got to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is absolute silence , and a strange fearfulness and disharmony in the atmosphere now . HARRY does n't know what to do with his hands or feet . WESLEY 'S arms hang at his sides . JOE quietly pushes the toy to one side of the table eager to study what is happening . WILLIE stops playing the marble-game , turns around and begins to wait . DUDLEY straightens up very , very vigorously , as if to say : " Nothing can scare me . I know love is the only thing . " The ARAB is the same as ever , but watchful . NICK is arrogantly aloof . There is a moment of this silence and tension , as though BLICK were waiting for everybody to acknowledge his presence . He is obviously flattered by the acknowledgment of Harry , Dudley , Wesley , and Willie , but a little irritated by Nick 's aloofness and unfriendliness. p. 34 NICK Do n't look at me . I ca n't tell a street-walker from a lady . You married ? BLICK You 're not asking me questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're a man of about forty-five or so . You ought to know better . BLICK ( Angry ) Street-walkers are working out of this place . NICK ( Beginning to shout ) Now , do n't start any trouble with me . People come here to drink and loaf around . I do n't care who they are . BLICK Well , I do . NICK The only way to find out if a lady is a street-walker is to walk the streets with her , go to bed , and make sure . You would n't want to do that . You 'd like to , of course . BLICK Any more of it , and I 'll have your joint closed . NICK ( Very casually , without ill-will ) Listen . I 've got no use for you , or anybody like you . You 're out to change the world from something bad to something worse . Something like yourself . BLICK ( Furious pause , and contempt ) I 'll be back tonight . He begins to go . p. 35 NICK ( Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do n't come back tonight . Send somebody else . I do n't like your personality . BLICK ( Casually , but with contempt ) Do n't break any laws . I do n't like yours , either . He looks the place over , and goes . There is a moment of silence . Then WILLIE turns and puts a new nickel in the slot and starts a new game . WESLEY turns to the piano and rather falteringly begins to play . His heart really is n't in it . HARRY walks about , unable to dance . DUDLEY lapses into his customary melancholy , at a table . NICK whistles a little : suddenly stops . JOE winds the toy . JOE ( Comically ) Nick . You going to kill that man ? NICK I 'm disgusted . JOE Yeah ? Why ? NICK Why should I get worked up over a guy like that ? Why should I hate him ? He 's nothing . He 's nobody . He 's a mouse . But every time he comes into this place I get burned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't want to sit down . He does n't want to take things easy . Tell me one thing ? JOE Do my best . p. 36 NICK What 's a punk like that want to go out and try to change the world for ? JOE ( Amazed ) Does he want to change the world , too ? NICK ( Irritated ) You know what I mean . What 's he want to bother people for ? He 's sick . JOE ( Almost to himself , reflecting on the fact that Blick too wants to change the world ) I guess he wants to change the world at that . NICK So I go to work and hate him . JOE It 's not him , Nick . It 's everything . NICK Yeah , I know . But I 've still got no use for him . He 's no good . You know what I mean ? He hurts little people . ( Confused ) One of the girls tried to commit suicide on account of him . ( Furiously ) I 'll break his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my joint . ( Afterthought ) Or anybody 's feelings , either . JOE He may not be so bad , deep down underneath . NICK I know all about him . He 's no good . During this talk WESLEY has really begun to play the piano , the toy is rattling again , and little by little HARRY has begun to dance . NICK has come around the bar , and now , very much like a child  --  forgetting all his anger  --  is watching the toy work . He begins to smile at everything : turns and listens to WESLEY : watches HARRY : nods at the ARAB : shakes his head at DUDLEY : and gestures amiably about WILLIE . It 's his joint all right . It 's a good , low-down , honky-tonk American place that lets people alone . p. 37 NICK I 've got a good joint . There 's nothing wrong here . Hey . Comedian . Stick to the dancing tonight . I think you 're O.K. Wesley ? Do some more of that tonight . That 's fine ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my way at last . ( On telephone ) Hello , Ma ? Is that you , Ma ? Harry . I got the job.He hangs up and walks around , smiling . NICK ( Watching the toy all this time ) Say , that really is something . What is that , anyway ? MARY L. comes in . JOE ( Holding it toward NICK , and MARY L. ) Nick , this is a toy . A contraption devised by the cunning of man to drive boredom , or grief , or anger out of children . A noble gadget . A gadget , I might say , infinitely nobler than any other I can think of at the moment . Everybody gathers around Joe 's table to look at the toy . The toy stops working . JOE winds the music box . Lifts a whistle : blows it , making a very strange , funny and sorrowful sound.Delightful . Tragic , but delightful . WESLEY plays the music-box theme on the piano.MARY L. takes a table . NICK Joe . That girl , Kitty . What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hurt anybody , let alone a tooth . NICK goes to Mary L. 's table . HARRY imitates the toy . Dances . The piano music comes up , the light dims slowly , while the piano solo continues. @x An hour later . All the people who were at Nick 's when the curtain came down are still there . JOE at his table , quietly shuffling and turning a deck of cards , and at the same time watching the face of the woman , and looking at the initials on her handbag , as though they were the symbols of the lost glory of the world . The WOMAN , in turn , very casually regards JOE occasionally . Or rather senses him ; has sensed him in fact the whole hour . She is mildly tight on beer , and JOE himself is tight , but as always completely under control ; simply sharper . The others are about , at tables , and so on . JOE Is it Madge  --  Laubowitz ? MARY L. Is what what ? JOE Is the name Mabel Lepescu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initials M. L. stand for . The initials on your bag . MARY L. No . JOE ( After a long pause , thinking deeply what the name might be , turning a card , looking into the beautiful face of the woman ) Margie Longworthy ? MARY L. ( All this is very natural and sincere , no comedy on the part of the people involved : they are both solemn , being drunk ) No. p. 40 JOE ( His voice higher-pitched , as though he were growing a little alarmed ) Midge Laurie ? ( MARY shakes her head ) My initials are J. T. MARY L. ( Pause ) John ? JOE No . ( Pause ) Martha Lancaster ? MARY L. No . ( Slight pause ) Joseph ? JOE Well , not exactly . That 's my first name , but everybody calls me Joe . The last name is the tough one . I 'll help you a little . I 'm Irish . ( Pause ) Is it just plain Mary ? MARY L. Yes , it is . I 'm Irish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English on my mother 's side . JOE I 'm Irish on both sides . Mary 's one of my favorite names . I guess that 's why I did n't think of it . I met a girl in Mexico City named Mary once . She was an American from Philadelphia . She got married there . In Mexico City , I mean . While I was there . We were in love , too . At least I was . You never know about anyone else . They were engaged , you see , and her mother was with her , so they went through with it . Must have been six or seven years ago . She 's probably got three or four children by this time . p. 41 MARY L. Are you still in love with her ? JOE Well  --  no . To tell you the truth , I 'm not sure . I guess I am . I did n't even know she was engaged until a couple of days before they got married . I thought I was going to marry her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids we would be likely to have . My favorite was the third one . The first two were fine . Handsome and fine and intelligent , but that third one was different . Dumb and goofy-looking . I liked him a lot . When she told me she was going to be married , I did n't feel so bad about the first two , it was that dumb one . MARY L. ( After a pause of some few seconds ) What do you do ? JOE Do ? To tell you the truth , nothing . MARY L. Do you always drink a great deal ? JOE ( Scientifically ) Not always . Only when I 'm awake . I sleep seven or eight hours every night , you know . MARY L. How nice . I mean to drink when you 're awake . JOE ( Thoughtfully ) It 's a privilege . MARY L. Do you really like to drink ? p. 42 JOE ( Positively ) As much as I like to breathe . MARY L. ( Beautifully ) Why ? JOE ( Dramatically ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because I do n't like to be gypped . Because I do n't like to be dead most of the time and just a little alive every once in a long while . ( Pause ) If I do n't drink , I become fascinated by unimportant things  --  like everybody else . I get busy . Do things . All kinds of little stupid things , for all kinds of little stupid reasons . Proud , selfish , ordinary things . I 've done them . Now I do n't do anything . I live all the time . Then I go to sleep . ( Pause ) MARY L. Do you sleep well ? JOE ( Taking it for granted ) Of course . MARY L. ( Quietly , almost with tenderness ) What are your plans ? JOE ( Loudly , but also tenderly ) Plans ? I have n't got any . I just get up . MARY L. ( Beginning to understand everything ) Oh , yes . Yes , of course.DUDLEY puts a nickel in the phonograph. p. 43 JOE ( Thoughtfully ) Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The thinking appears to be profound and complex , and has the effect of giving his face a very comical and naive expression ) That question calls for a pretty complicated answer . ( He smiles abstractly ) MARY L. Oh , I did n't mean  --  JOE ( Swiftly , gallantly ) No . No . I insist . I know why . It 's just a matter of finding words . Little ones . MARY L. It really does n't matter . JOE ( Seriously ) Oh , yes , it does . ( Clinically ) Now , why do I drink ? ( Scientifically ) No . Why does anybody drink ? ( Working it out ) Every day has twenty-four hours . MARY L. ( Sadly , but brightly ) Yes , that 's true . JOE Twenty-four hours . Out of the twenty-four hours at least twenty-three and a half are  --  my God , I do n't know why  --  dull , dead , boring , empty , and murderous . Minutes on the clock , not time of living . It does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , twenty-three and a half hours of the twenty-four are spent waiting . p. 44 MARY L. Waiting ? JOE ( Gesturing , loudly ) And the more you wait , the less there is to wait for . MARY L. ( Attentively , beautifully his student ) Oh ? JOE ( Continuing ) That goes on for days and days , and weeks and months and years , and years , and the first thing you know all the years are dead . All the minutes are dead . You yourself are dead . There 's nothing to wait for any more . Nothing except minutes on the clock . No time of life . Nothing but minutes , and idiocy . Beautiful , bright , intelligent idiocy . ( Pause ) Does that answer your question ? MARY L. ( Earnestly ) I 'm afraid it does . Thank you . You should n't have gone to all the trouble . JOE No trouble at all . ( Pause ) You have children ? MARY L. Yes . Two . A son and a daughter . JOE ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MARY L. Yes . JOE Then why are you sad ? p. 45 MARY L. I was always sad . It 's just that after I was married I was allowed to drink . JOE ( Eagerly ) Who are you waiting for ? MARY L. No one . JOE ( Smiling ) I 'm not waiting for anybody , either . MARY L. My husband , of course . JOE Oh , sure . MARY L. He 's a lawyer . JOE ( Standing , leaning on the table ) He 's a great guy . I like him . I 'm very fond of him . MARY L. ( Listening ) You have responsibilities ? JOE ( Loudly ) One , and thousands . As a matter of fact , I feel responsible to everybody . At least to everybody I meet . I 've been trying for three years to find out if it 's possible to live what I think is a civilized life . I mean a life that ca n't hurt any other life . MARY L. You 're famous ? JOE Very . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dance ? p. 46 MARY L. All right . JOE ( Loudly ) I 'm sorry . I do n't dance . I did n't think you 'd like to . MARY L. To tell you the truth , I do n't like to dance at all . JOE ( Proudly . Commentator ) I can hardly walk . MARY L. You mean you 're tight ? JOE ( Smiling ) No . I mean all the time . MARY L. ( Looking at him closely ) Were you ever in Paris ? JOE In 1929 , and again in 1934 . MARY L. What month of 1934 ? JOE Most of April , all of May , and a little of June . MARY L. I was there in November and December that year . JOE We were there almost at the same time . You were married ? MARY L. Engaged . ( They are silent a moment , looking at one another . Quietly and with great charm ) Are you really in love with me ? JOE Yes . p. 47 MARY L. Is it the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( He sits down ) MARY L. If you do n't see me again , will you be very unhappy ? JOE Very . MARY L. ( Getting up ) I 'm so pleased . JOE is deeply grieved that she is going . In fact , he is almost panic-stricken about it , getting up in a way that is full of furious sorrow and regret.I must go now . Please do n't get up . JOE is up , staring at her with amazement.Good-by . JOE ( Simply ) Good-by . The WOMAN stands looking at him a moment , then turns and goes . JOE stands staring after her for a long time . Just as he is slowly sitting down again , the NEWSBOY enters , and goes to Joe 's table . NEWSBOY Paper , Mister ? JOE How many you got this time ? NEWSBOY Eleven . JOE buys them all , looks at the lousy headlines , throws them away . The NEWSBOY looks at JOE , amazed . He walks over to NICK at the bar . p. 48 NEWSBOY ( Troubled ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NICK ( Casually but emphatically ) I own this place . NEWSBOY Can you use a great lyric tenor ? NICK ( Almost to himself ) Great lyric tenor ? ( Loudly ) Who ? NEWSBOY ( Loud and the least bit angry ) Me . I 'm getting too big to sell papers . I do n't want to holler headlines all the time . I want to sing . You can use a great lyric tenor , ca n't you ? NICK What 's lyric about you ? NEWSBOY ( Voice high-pitched , confused ) My voice . NICK Oh . ( Slight pause , giving in ) All right , then  --  sing ! The NEWSBOY breaks into swift and beautiful song : " When Irish Eyes Are Smiling . " NICK and JOE listen carefully : NICK with wonder , JOE with amazement and delight . NEWSBOY ( Singing ) When Irish eyes are smiling , Sure ' t is like a morn in Spring.In the lilt of Irish laughter , You can hear the angels sing . When Irish hearts are happy , All the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 49 NICK ( Loudly , swiftly ) Are you Irish ? NEWSBOY ( Speaking swiftly , loudly , a little impatient with the irrelevant question ) No . I 'm Greek . ( He finishes the song , singing louder than ever ) Sure they steal your heart away . He turns to NICK dramatically , like a vaudeville singer begging his audience for applause . NICK studies the boy eagerly . JOE gets to his feet and leans toward the BOY and NICK . NICK Not bad . Let me hear you again about a year from now . NEWSBOY ( Thrilled ) Honest ? NICK Yeah . Along about November 7th , 1940 . NEWSBOY ( Happier than ever before in his life , running over to JOE ) Did you hear it too , Mister ? JOE Yes , and it 's great . What part of Greece ? NEWSBOY Salonica . Gosh , Mister . Thanks . JOE Do n't wait a year . Come back with some papers a little later . You 're a great singer . NEWSBOY ( Thrilled and excited ) Aw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to NICK ) Thanks , Mister . He runs out . JOE and NICK look at the swinging doors . JOE sits down . NICK laughs . p. 50 NICK Joe , people are so wonderful . Look at that kid . JOE Of course they 're wonderful . Every one of them is wonderful . MC CARTHY and KRUPP come in , talking.MC CARTHY is a big man in work clothes , which make him seem very young . He is wearing black jeans , and a blue workman 's shirt . No tie . No hat . He has broad shoulders , a lean intelligent face , thick black hair . In his right back pocket is the longshoreman 's hook . His arms are long and hairy . His sleeves are rolled up to just below his elbows . He is a casual man , easy-going in movement , sharp in perception , swift in appreciation of charm or innocence or comedy , and gentle in spirit . His speech is clear and full of warmth . His voice is powerful , but modulated . He enjoys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he is fond of people , in spite of the mess they are . KRUPP is not quite as tall or broad-shouldered as MC CARTHY . He is physically encumbered by his uniform , club , pistol , belt , and cap . And he is plainly not at home in the role of policeman . His movement is stiff and unintentionally pompous . He is a naive man , essentially good . His understanding is less than McCarthy 's , but he is honest and he does n't try to bluff . KRUPP You do n't understand what I mean . Hi-ya , Joe . JOE Hello , Krupp . p. 51 MCCARTHY Hi-ya , Joe . JOE Hello , McCarthy . KRUPP Two beers , Nick . ( To MC CARTHY ) All I do is carry out orders , carry out orders . I do n't know what the idea is behind the order . Who it 's for , or who it 's against , or why . All I do is carry it out . NICK gives them beer . MCCARTHY You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Examiner every morning . The Call-Bulletin every night . MCCARTHY And carry out orders . What are the orders now ? KRUPP To keep the peace down here on the waterfront . MCCARTHY Keep it for who ? ( To JOE ) Right ? JOE ( Sorrowfully ) Right . KRUPP How do I know for who ? The peace . Just keep it . MCCARTHY It 's got to be kept for somebody . Who would you suspect it 's kept for ? KRUPP For citizens ! MCCARTHY I 'm a citizen ! p. 52 KRUPP All right , I 'm keeping it for you . MCCARTHY By hitting me over the head with a club ? ( To JOE ) Right ? JOE ( Melancholy , with remembrance ) I do n't know . KRUPP Mac , you know I never hit you over the head with a club . MCCARTHY But you will if you 're on duty at the time and happen to stand on the opposite side of myself , on duty . KRUPP We went to Mission High together . We were always good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time over Alma Haggerty . Did you marry Alma Haggerty ? ( To JOE ) Right ? JOE Everything 's right . MCCARTHY No . Did you ? ( To JOE ) Joe , are you with me or against me ? JOE I 'm with everybody . One at a time . KRUPP No . And that 's just what I mean . MCCARTHY You mean neither one of us is going to marry the thing we 're fighting for ? KRUPP I do n't even know what it is. p. 53 MCCARTHY You do n't read enough , I tell you . KRUPP Mac , you do n't know what you 're fighting for , either . MCCARTHY It 's so simple , it 's fantastic . KRUPP All right , what are you fighting for ? MCCARTHY For the rights of the inferior . Right ? JOE Something like that . KRUPP The who ? MCCARTHY The inferior . The world full of Mahoneys who have n't got what it takes to make monkeys out of everybody else , near by . The men who were created equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MCCARTHY I 'm a longshoreman . And an idealist . I 'm a man with too much brawn to be an intellectual , exclusively . I married a small , sensitive , cultured woman so that my kids would be sissies instead of suckers . A strong man with any sensibility has no choice in this world but to be a heel , or a worker . I have n't the heart to be a heel , so I 'm a worker . I 've got a son in high school who 's already thinking of being a writer . KRUPP I wanted to be a writer once . JOE Wonderful . He puts down the paper , looks at KRUPP and MC CARTHY. p. 54 MCCARTHY They all wanted to be writers . Every maniac in the world that ever brought about the murder of people through war started out in an attic or a basement writing poetry . It stank . So they got even by becoming important heels . And it 's still going on . KRUPP Is it really , Joe ? JOE Look at today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some punk who is trying to be Shakespeare . Ten years from now he 'll be a senator . Or a communist . KRUPP Somebody ought to do something about it . MCCARTHY ( Mischievously , with laughter in his voice ) The thing to do is to have more magazines . Hundreds of them . Thousands . Print everything they write , so they 'll believe they 're immortal . That way keep them from going haywire . KRUPP Mac , you ought to be a writer yourself . MCCARTHY I hate the tribe . They 're mischief-makers . Right ? JOE ( Swiftly ) Everything 's right . Right and wrong . KRUPP Then why do you read ? MCCARTHY ( Laughing ) It 's relaxing . It 's soothing . ( Pause ) The lousiest people born into the world are writers . Language is all right . It 's the people who use language that are lousy . The ARAB has moved a little closer , and is listening carefully . ( To the ARAB ) What do you think , Brother ? p. 55 ARAB ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundation . All the way down the line . What . What-not . Nothing . I go walk and look at sky . ( He goes ) KRUPP What ? What-not ? ( To JOE ) What 's that mean ? JOE ( Slowly , thinking , remembering ) What ? What-not ? That means this side , that side . Inhale , exhale . What : birth . What-not : death . The inevitable , the astounding , the magnificent seed of growth and decay in all things . Beginning , and end . That man , in his own way , is a prophet . He is one who , with the help of beer , is able to reach that state of deep understanding in which what and what-not , the reasonable and the unreasonable , are one . MCCARTHY Right . KRUPP If you can understand that kind of talk , how can you be a longshoreman ? MCCARTHY I come from a long line of McCarthys who never married or slept with anything but the most powerful and quarrel-some flesh . He drinks beer .

Son , you 're a genius . HARRY ( Delighted , shaking hands with MC CARTHY ) I go on in front of an audience for the first time in my life tonight . MCCARTHY They 'll be delighted .

MCCARTHY ( Thoughtfully ) It may be that you 've stumbled headlong into a new kind of comedy . HARRY Well , what good is it if it does n't make anybody laugh ? MCCARTHY There are kinds of laughter , son . I must say , in all truth , that I am laughing , although not out loud . HARRY I want to hear people laugh . Out loud .

She 's dined with young men of quality and social position . She 's above Tom.TOM comes running in . TOM ( Disgusted ) They were running when I got there . Frankie would n't take the bet . McCarthy did n't get a call till the stretch . I thought we were going to save all this money . Then McCarthy won by two lengths . JOE What 'd he pay , fifteen to one ?

Take them up to Kitty ? Do you think they 'd stop her from crying ? JOE They might . You get curious about the way they work and you forget whatever it is you 're remembering that 's making you cry . That 's what they 're for . TOM Yeah . Sure . The girl at the store asked me what I wanted with toys . I 'll take them up to Kitty . ( Tragically ) She 's like a little girl .

After a while he begins a soft shoe dance . NICK What were you crying about ? JOE My mother . NICK What about her ? JOE She was dead . I stopped crying when they gave me the toys . NICK 'S MOTHER , a little old woman of sixty or so , dressed plainly in black , her face shining , comes in briskly , chattering loudly in Italian , gesturing . NICK is delighted to see her . NICK 'S MOTHER ( In Italian ) Everything all right , Nickie ? NICK ( In Italian ) Sure , Mamma . ( NICK 'S MOTHER leaves as gaily and as noisily as she came , after half a minute of loud Italian family talk. ) p. 68 JOE Who was that ? NICK ( To JOE , proudly and a little sadly ) My mother .

An old man who looks as if he might have been Kit Carson at one time walks in importantly , moves about , and finally stands at Joe 's table . CARSON Murphy 's the name . Just an old trapper . Mind if I sit down ? JOE Be delighted . What 'll you drink ? CARSON ( Sitting down ) Beer . Same as I 've been drinking . And thanks . JOE ( To NICK ) Glass of beer , Nick . NICK brings the beer to the table , KIT CARSON swallows it in one swig , wipes his big white mustache with the back of his right hand . CARSON ( Moving in ) I do n't suppose you ever fell in love with a midget weighing thirty-nine pounds ? p. 69 JOE ( Studying the man ) Ca n't say I have , but have another beer . CARSON ( Intimately ) Thanks , thanks . Down in Gallup , twenty years ago . Fellow by the name of Rufus Jenkins came to town with six white horses and two black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses for him because his left leg was wood and he could n't do it . Had a meeting at Parker 's Mercantile Store and finally came to blows , me and Henry Walpal . Bashed his head with a brass cuspidor and ran away to Mexico , but he did n't die.Could n't speak a word . Took up with a cattle-breeder named Diego , educated in California . Spoke the language better than you and me . Said , Your job , Murph , is to feed them prize bulls . I said , Fine , what 'll I feed them ? He said , Hay , lettuce , salt , beer , and aspirin.Came to blows two days later over an accordion he claimed I stole . I had borrowed it . During the fight I busted it over his head ; ruined one of the finest accordions I ever saw . Grabbed a horse and rode back across the border . Texas . Got to talking with a fellow who looked honest . Turned out to be a Ranger who was looking for me . JOE Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will I ever forget that lady ? Will I ever get over that amazon of small proportions ? p. 70 JOE Will you ? CARSON If I live to be sixty . JOE Sixty ? You look more than sixty now . CARSON That 's trouble showing in my face . Trouble and complications . I was fifty-eight three months ago . JOE That accounts for it , then . Go ahead , tell me more . CARSON Told the Texas Ranger my name was Rothstein , mining engineer from Pennsylvania , looking for something worth while . Mentioned two places in Houston . Nearly lost an eye early one morning , going down the stairs . Ran into a six-footer with an iron-claw where his right hand was supposed to be . Said , You broke up my home . Told him I was a stranger in Houston . The girls gathered at the top of the stairs to see a fight . Seven of them . Six feet and an iron claw . That 's bad on the nerves . Kicked him in the mouth when he swung for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye except for quick thinking . He rolled into the gutter and pulled a gun . Fired seven times . I was back upstairs . Left the place an hour later , dressed in silk and feathers , with a hat swung around over my face . Saw him standing on the corner , waiting . Said , Care for a wiggle ? Said he did n't . I went on down the street and left town . I do n't suppose you ever had to put a dress on to save your skin , did you ? p. 71 JOE No , and I never fell in love with a midget weighing thirty-nine pounds . Have another beer ? CARSON Thanks . ( Swallows glass of beer ) Ever try to herd cattle on a bicycle ? JOE No . I never got around to that . CARSON Left Houston with sixty cents in my pocket , gift of a girl named Lucinda . Walked fourteen miles in fourteen hours . Big house with barb-wire all around , and big dogs . One thing I never could get around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirst . Dogs jumped up and came for me . Walked right into them , growing older every second . Went up to the door and knocked . Big negress opened the door , closed it quick . Said , On your way , white trash.Knocked again . Said , On your way . Again . On your way . Again . This time the old man himself opened the door , ninety , if he was a day . Sawed-off shotgun , too.Said , I ai n't looking for trouble , Father . I 'm hungry and thirsty , name 's Cavanaugh.Took me in and made mint juleps for the two of us.Said , Living here alone , Father ? Said , Drink and ask no questions . Maybe I am and maybe I ai n't . You saw the lady . Draw your own conclusions.I 'd heard of that , but did n't wink out of tact . If I told you that old Southern gentleman was my grandfather , you would n't believe me , would you ? p. 72 JOE I might . CARSON Well , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he had been , though . JOE Where did you herd cattle on a bicycle ? CARSON Toledo , Ohio , 1918 . JOE Toledo , Ohio ? They do n't herd cattle in Toledo . CARSON They do n't anymore . They did in 1918 . One fellow did , leastaways . Bookkeeper named Sam Gold . Straight from the East Side , New York . Sombrero , lariats , Bull Durham , two head of cattle and two bicycles . Called his place The Gold Bar Ranch , two acres , just outside the city limits.That was the year of the War , you 'll remember . JOE Yeah , I remember , but how about herding them two cows on a bicycle ? How 'd you do it ? CARSON Easiest thing in the world . Rode no hands . Had to , otherwise could n't lasso the cows . Worked for Sam Gold till the cows ran away . Bicycles scared them . They went into Toledo . Never saw hide nor hair of them again . Advertised in every paper , but never got them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to New York.Took four aces from a deck of red cards and walked to town . Poker . Fellow in the game named Chuck Collins , liked to gamble . Told him with a smile I did n't suppose he 'd care to bet a hundred dollars I would n't hold four aces the next hand . Called it . My cards were red on the blank side . The other cards were blue . Plumb forgot all about it . Showed him four aces . Ace of spades , ace of clubs , ace of diamonds , ace of hearts . I 'll remember them four cards if I live to be sixty . Would have been killed on the spot except for the hurricane that year . p. 73 JOE Hurricane ? CARSON You have n't forgotten the Toledo hurricane of 1918 , have you ? JOE No . There was no hurricane in Toledo in 1918 , or any other year . CARSON For the love of God , then what do you suppose that commotion was ? And how come I came to in Chicago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . CARSON No , that was n't it . You go back to the papers of November 1918 , and I think you 'll find there was a hurricane in Toledo . I remember sitting on the roof of a two-story house , floating northwest . JOE ( Seriously ) Northwest ? CARSON Now , son , do n't tell me you do n't believe me , either ? JOE ( Pause . Very seriously , energetically and sharply ) Of course I believe you . Living is an art . It 's not book-keeping . It takes a lot of rehearsing for a man to get to be himself . CARSON ( Thoughtfully , smiling , and amazed ) You 're the first man I 've ever met who believes me . JOE ( Seriously ) Have another beer . TOM comes in with the Rand-McNally book , the revolver , and the box of cartridges . KIT goes to bar . p. 74 JOE ( To TOM ) Did you give her the toys ? TOM Yeah , I gave them to her . JOE Did she stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever . JOE That 's funny . I wonder why . TOM Joe , if I was a minute earlier , Frankie would have taken the bet and now we 'd have about a thousand five hundred dollars . How much of it would you have given me , Joe ? JOE If she 'd marry you  --  all of it . TOM Would you , Joe ? JOE ( Opening packages , examining book first , and revolver next ) Sure . In this realm there 's only one subject , and you 're it . It 's my duty to see that my subject is happy . TOM Joe , do you think we 'll ever have eighty dollars for a race sometime again when there 's a fifteen-to-one shot that we like , weather good , track fast , they get off to a good start , our horse does n't get a call till the stretch , we think we 're going to lose all that money , and then it wins , by a nose ? JOE I did n't quite get that . p. 75 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impossible . No , Tom , we wo n't . We were just a little late , that 's all . TOM We might , Joe . JOE It 's not likely . TOM Then how am I ever going to make enough money to marry her ? JOE I do n't know , Tom . Maybe you are n't . TOM Joe , I got to marry Kitty . ( Shaking his head ) You ought to see the crazy room she lives in . JOE What kind of a room is it ? TOM It 's little . It crowds you in . It 's bad , Joe . Kitty do n't belong in a place like that . JOE You want to take her away from there ? TOM Yeah . I want her to live in a house where there 's room enough to live . Kitty ought to have a garden , or something . JOE You want to take care of her ? TOM Yeah , sure , Joe . I ought to take care of somebody good that makes me feel like I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a job . What can you do ? p. 76 TOM I finished high school , but I do n't know what I can do . JOE Sometimes when you think about it , what do you think you 'd like to do ? TOM Just sit around like you , Joe , and have somebody run errands for me and drink champagne and take things easy and never be broke and never worry about money . JOE That 's a noble ambition . NICK ( To JOE ) How do you do it ? JOE I really do n't know , but I think you 've got to have the full co-operation of the Good Lord . NICK I ca n't understand the way you talk . TOM Joe , shall I go back and see if I can get her to stop crying ? JOE Give me a hand and I 'll go with you . TOM ( Amazed ) What ! You 're going to get up already ? JOE She 's crying , is n't she ? TOM She 's crying . Worse than ever now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TOM I 've seen you sit in one place from four in the morning till two the next morning . p. 77 JOE At my best , Tom , I do n't travel by foot . That 's all . Come on . Give me a hand . I 'll find some way to stop her from crying . TOM ( Helping JOE ) Joe , I never did tell you . You 're a different kind of a guy . JOE ( Swiftly , a little angry ) Do n't be silly . I do n't understand things . I 'm trying to understand them . JOE is a little drunk . They go out together . The lights go down slowly , while WESLEY plays the piano , and come up slowly on : @x A cheap bed in Nick 's to indicate room 21 of The New York Hotel , upstairs , around the corner from Nick 's . The bed can be at the center of Nick 's , or up on the little stage . Everything in Nick 's is the same , except that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except WESLEY who is playing the piano softly and sadly . KITTY DUVAL , in a dress she has carried around with her from the early days in Ohio , is seated on the bed , tying a ribbon in her hair . She looks at herself in a hand mirror . She is deeply grieved at the change she sees in herself . She takes off the ribbon , angry and hurt . She lifts a book from the bed and tries to read . She begins to sob again . She picks up an old picture of herself and looks at it . Sobs harder than ever , falling on the bed and burying her face . There is a knock , as if at the door . DUVAL ( Sobbing ) Who is it ? TOM Kitty , it 's me . Tom . Me and Joe . JOE , followed by TOM , comes to the bed quietly . JOE is holding a rather large toy carousel . JOE studies KITTY a moment . He sets the toy carousel on the floor , at the foot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bending down close to her ) Do n't cry any more , Kitty . p. 79 DUVAL ( Not looking , sobbing ) I do n't like this life . JOE starts the carousel which makes a strange , sorrowful , tinkling music . The music begins slowly , becomes swift , gradually slows down , and ends . JOE himself is interested in the toy , watches and listens to it carefully . TOM ( Eagerly ) Kitty . Joe got up from his chair at Nick 's just to get you a toy and come here . This one makes music . We rode all over town in a cab to get it . Listen . KITTY sits up slowly , listening , while TOM watches her . Everything happens slowly and somberly . KITTY notices the photograph of herself when she was a little girl . Lifts it , and looks at it again . TOM ( Looking ) Who 's that little girl , Kitty ? DUVAL That 's me . When I was seven .

JOE looks up at them . p. 80 DUVAL Tom ? TOM ( Eagerly ) Yeah , Kitty . DUVAL Tom , when you were a little boy what did you want to be ? TOM ( A little bewildered , but eager to please her ) What , Kitty ? DUVAL Do you remember when you were a little boy ? TOM ( Thoughtfully ) Yeah , I remember sometimes , Kitty . DUVAL What did you want to be ? TOM ( Looks at JOE . JOE holds Tom 's eyes a moment . Then TOM is able to speak ) Sometimes I wanted to be a locomotive engineer . Sometimes I wanted to be a policeman . DUVAL I wanted to be a great actress . ( She looks up into Tom 's face ) Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? TOM ( Looks at JOE . JOE holds Tom 's eyes again , encouraging Tom by his serious expression to go on talking ) Yeah , now I remember . Sure , Kitty . I wanted to be a doctor  --  once . DUVAL ( Smiling sadly ) I 'm so glad . Because I wanted to be an actress and have a young doctor come to the theater and see me and fall in love with me and send me flowers . ( JOE pantomimes to TOM , demanding that he go on talking ) p. 81 TOM I would do that , Kitty . DUVAL I would n't know who it was , and then one day I 'd see him in the street and fall in love with him . I would n't know he was the one who was in love with me . I 'd think about him all the time . I 'd dream about him . I 'd dream of being near him the rest of my life . I 'd dream of having children that looked like him .

After that we 'd take a train and go to beautiful cities and see the wonderful people everywhere and give money to the poor and whenever people were sick he 'd go to them and make them well again . TOM looks at JOE , bewildered , confused , and full of sorrow . KITTY is deep in memory , almost in a trance . JOE ( Gently ) Talk to her , Tom . Be the wonderful young doctor she dreamed about and never found . Go ahead . Correct the errors of the world . TOM Joe . ( Pathetically ) I do n't know what to say . There is rowdy singing in the hall . A loud young VOICE sings : " Sailing , sailing , over the bounding main . " SAILOR Kitty . Oh , Kitty ! KITTY stirs , shocked , coming out of the trance.Where the hell are you ? Oh , Kitty . TOM jumps up , furiously . p. 82 WOMAN 'S VOICE ( In the hall ) Who you looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . WOMAN 'S VOICE Do n't go any further . SAILOR ( With impersonal contempt ) You ?

Want to get tough , hey ? Close the door . Go hide . WOMAN 'S VOICE You pickpocket . All of you.The door slams . SAILOR ( Roaring with laughter which is very sad ) Oh  --  Kitty.Room 21 . Where the hell is that room ? TOM ( To JOE ) Joe , I 'll kill him . DUVAL ( Fully herself again , terribly frightened ) Who is it ? She looks long and steadily at TOM and JOE . TOM is standing , excited and angry . JOE is completely at ease , his expression full of pity . KITTY buries her face in the bed . p. 83 JOE ( Gently ) Tom . Just take him away . SAILOR Here it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My blue heaven . The west , a nest , and you . Just Molly and me . ( Tragically ) Ah , to hell with everything .

A thousand apologies . ( To KITTY ) I 'll come back later . TOM ( Taking him by the shoulders , furiously ) If you do , I 'll kill you . JOE holds TOM . TOM pushes the frightened boy away . JOE ( Somberly ) Tom . You stay here with Kitty . I 'm going down to Union Square to hire an automobile . I 'll be back in a few minutes . We 'll ride out to the ocean and watch the sun go down . Then we 'll ride down the Great Highway to Half Moon Bay . We 'll have supper down there , and you and Kitty can dance . TOM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Joe , you mean you 're going to go on an errand for me ? You mean you 're not going to send me ? p. 84 JOE That 's right . He gestures toward KITTY , indicating that TOM shall talk to her , protect the innocence in her which is in so much danger when TOM is n't near , which TOM loves so deeply . JOE leaves . TOM studies KITTY , his face becoming child-like and somber . He sets the carousel into motion , listens , watching KITTY , who lifts herself slowly , looking only at TOM . TOM lifts the turning carousel and moves it slowly toward KITTY , as though the toy were his heart . The piano music comes up loudly and the lights go down , while HARRY is heard dancing swiftly. @x A little later . WESLEY , the colored boy , is at the piano .

NICK ( Going to the phone ) Important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . NICK Big what ? ( To WESLEY and HARRY ) Hey , you . Quiet . I want to hear this important stuff . WESLEY stops playing the piano . HARRY stops dancing . KIT CARSON comes close to NICK . CARSON If there 's anything I can do , name it . I 'll do it for you . I 'm fifty-eight years old ; been through three wars ; married four times ; the father of countless children whose names I do n't even know . I 've got no money . I live from hand to mouth . But if there 's anything I can do , name it . I 'll do it . NICK ( Patiently ) Listen , Pop . For a moment , please sit down and go back to sleep  --  for me . CARSON I can do that , too . He sits down , folds his arms , and puts his head into them . But not for long . As NICK begins to talk , he listens carefully , gets to his feet , and then begins to express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 87 NICK ( On phone ) Yeah ? ( Pause ) Who ? Oh , I see . ( Listens ) Why do n't you leave them alone ? ( Listens ) The church-people ? Well , to hell with the church-people . I 'm a Catholic myself . ( Listens ) All right . I 'll send them away . I 'll tell them to lay low for a couple of days . Yeah , I know how it is . Nick 's daughter ANNA comes in shyly , looking at her father , and stands unnoticed by the piano.What ? ( Very angry ) Listen . I do n't like that Blick . He was here this morning , and I told him not to come back . I 'll keep the girls out of here . You keep Blick out of here . ( Listens ) I know his brother-in-law is important , but I do n't want him to come down here . He looks for trouble everywhere , and he always finds it . I do n't break any laws . I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years nobody 's been robbed , murdered , or gypped . I leave people alone . Your swanky joints uptown make trouble for you every night . ( NICK gestures to WESLEY  --  keeps listening on the phone  --  puts his hand over the mouthpiece . To WESLEY and HARRY . ) Start playing again . My ears have got a headache . Go into your dance , son . ( WESLEY begins to play again . HARRY begins to dance . NICK , into mouthpiece . ) Yeah . I 'll keep them out . Just see that Blick does n't come around and start something . ( Pause ) O.K. ( He hangs up ) p. 88 CARSON Trouble coming ? NICK That lousy Vice Squad again . It 's that gorilla Blick . CARSON Anybody at all . You can count on me . What kind of a gorilla is this gorilla Blick ? NICK Very dignified . Toenails on his fingers . ANNA ( To KIT CARSON , with great , warm , beautiful pride , pointing at NICK ) That 's my father . CARSON ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , the magnificent event ) Well , bless your heart , child . Bless your lovely heart . I had a little daughter point me out in a crowd once . NICK ( Surprised ) Anna . What the hell are you doing here ? Get back home where you belong and help Grandma cook me some supper . ANNA smiles at her father , understanding him , knowing that his words are words of love . She turns and goes , looking at him all the way out , as much as to say that she would cook for him the rest of her life . NICK stares at the swinging doors . KIT CARSON moves toward them , two or three steps . ANNA pushes open one of the doors and peeks in , to look at her father again . She waves to him . Turns and runs . NICK is very sad . He does n't know what to do . He gets a glass and a bottle . Pours himself a drink . Swallows some . It is n't enough , so he pours more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful , beautiful baby . Anna , she is you again . ( He brings out a handkerchief , touches his eyes , and blows his nose . KIT CARSON moves close to NICK , watching Nick 's face . NICK looks at him . Loudly , almost making KIT jump ) You 're broke , are n't you ? p. 89 CARSON Always . Always . NICK All right . Go into the kitchen and give Sam a hand . Eat some food and when you come back you can have a couple of beers . CARSON ( Studying NICK ) Anything at all . I know a good man when I see one . ( He goes ) ELSIE MANDELSPIEGEL comes into Nick 's . She is a beautiful , dark girl , with a sorrowful , wise , dreaming face , almost on the verge of tears , and full of pity . There is an aura of dream about her . She moves softly and gently , as if everything around her were unreal and pathetic . DUDLEY does n't notice her for a moment or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so amazed , he can barely move or speak . Her presence has the effect of changing him completely . He gets up from his chair , as if in a trance , and walks toward her , smiling sadly . ELSIE ( Looking at him ) Hello , Dudley . DUDLEY ( Broken-hearted ) Elsie . ELSIE I 'm sorry . ( Explaining ) So many people are sick . Last night a little boy died . I love you , but  --  She gestures , trying to indicate how hopeless love is . They sit down . p. 90 DUDLEY ( Staring at her , stunned and quieted ) Elsie . You 'll never know how glad I am to see you . Just to see you . ( Pathetically ) I was afraid I 'd never see you again . It was driving me crazy . I did n't want to live . Honest . ( He shakes his head mournfully , with dumb and beautiful affection . TWO STREETWALKERS come in , and pause near DUDLEY , at the bar ) I know . You told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I love you . ELSIE ( Quietly , somberly , gently , with great compassion ) I know you love me , and I love you , but do n't you see love is impossible in this world ? DUDLEY Maybe it is n't , Elsie . ELSIE Love is for birds . They have wings to fly away on when it 's time for flying . For tigers in the jungle because they do n't know their end . We know our end . Every night I watch over poor , dying men . I hear them breathing , crying , talking in their sleep . Crying for air and water and love , for mother and field and sunlight . We can never know love or greatness . We should know both . DUDLEY ( Deeply moved by her words ) Elsie , I love you . ELSIE You want to live . I want to live , too , but where ? Where can we escape our poor world ? p. 91 DUDLEY Elsie , we 'll find a place . ELSIE ( Smiling at him ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go together to a room in a cheap hotel , and dream that the world is beautiful , and that living is full of love and greatness . But in the morning , can we forget debts , and duties , and the cost of ridiculous things ? DUDLEY ( With blind faith ) Sure , we can , Elsie . ELSIE All right , Dudley . Of course . Come on . The time for the new pathetic war has come . Let 's hurry , before they dress you , stand you in line , hand you a gun , and have you kill and be killed . ELSIE looks at him gently , and takes his hand . DUDLEY embraces her shyly , as if he might hurt her . They go , as if they were a couple of young animals . There is a moment of silence . One of the STREETWALKERS bursts out laughing . KILLER Nick , what the hell kind of a joint are you running ? NICK Well , it 's not out of the world . It 's on a street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They bring whatever they 've got with them and they say what they must say . OTHER STREETWALKER It 's floozies like her that raise hell with our racket. p. 92 NICK ( Remembering ) Oh , yeah . Finnegan telephoned . KILLER That mouse in elephant 's body ? OTHER STREETWALKER What the hell does he want ? NICK Spend your time at the movies for the next couple of days . KILLER They 're all lousy . ( Mocking ) All about love . NICK Lousy or not lousy , for a couple of days the flat-foots are going to be romancing you , so stay out of here , and lay low . KILLER I always was a pushover for a man in uniform , with a badge , a club and a gun . KRUPP comes into the place . The girls put down their drinks . NICK O.K. , get going . The GIRLS begin to leave and meet KRUPP . OTHER STREETWALKER We was just going . KILLER We was formerly models at Magnin 's . They go . KRUPP ( At the bar ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put us on the tails of the girls , too . I do n't know . I wish to God I was back in the Sunset holding the hands of kids going home from school , where I belong . I do n't like trouble . Give me a beer . NICK gives him a beer . He drinks some.Right now , McCarthy , my best friend , is with sixty strikers who want to stop the finks who are going to try to unload the Mary Luckenbach tonight . Why the hell McCarthy ever became a longshoreman instead of a professor of some kind is something I 'll never know . p. 93 NICK Cowboys and Indians , cops and robbers , longshoremen and finks . KRUPP They 're all guys who are trying to be happy ; trying to make a living ; support a family ; bring up children ; enjoy sleep . Go to a movie ; take a drive on Sunday . They 're all good guys , so out of nowhere , comes trouble . All they want is a chance to get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amos and Andy go through their act . What the hell do they always want to make trouble for ? I been thinking everything over , Nick , and you know what I think ? NICK No . What ? KRUPP I think we 're all crazy . It came to me while I was on my way to Pier 27 . All of a sudden it hit me like a ton of bricks . A thing like that never happened to me before . Here we are in this wonderful world , full of all the wonderful things  --  here we are  --  all of us , and look at us . Just look at us . We 're crazy . We 're nuts . We 've got everything , but we always feel lousy and dissatisfied just the same . NICK Of course we 're crazy . Even so , we 've got to go on living together . ( He waves at the people in his joint ) KRUPP There 's no hope . I do n't suppose it 's right for an officer of the law to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right or not right , that 's how I feel . Why are we all so lousy ? This is a good world . It 's wonderful to get up in the morning and go out for a little walk and smell the trees and see the streets and the kids going to school and the clouds in the sky . It 's wonderful just to be able to move around and whistle a song if you feel like it , or maybe try to sing one . This is a nice world . So why do they make all the trouble ? p. 94 NICK I do n't know . Why ? KRUPP We 're crazy , that 's why . We 're no good any more . All the corruption everywhere . The poor kids selling themselves . A couple of years ago they were in grammar school . Everybody trying to get a lot of money in a hurry . Everybody betting the horses . Nobody going quietly for a little walk to the ocean . Nobody taking things easy and not wanting to make some kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quit being a cop . Let somebody else keep law and order . The stuff I hear about at headquarters . I 'm thirty-seven years old , and I still ca n't get used to it . The only trouble is , the wife 'll raise hell . NICK Ah , the wife . KRUPP She 's a wonderful woman , Nick . We 've got two of the swellest boys in the world . Twelve and seven years old . The ARAB gets up and moves closer to listen . NICK I did n't know that . KRUPP Sure . But what 'll I do ? I 've wanted to quit for seven years . I wanted to quit the day they began putting me through the school . I did n't quit . What 'll I do if I quit ? Where 's money going to be coming in from ? NICK That 's one of the reasons we 're all crazy . We do n't know where it 's going to be coming in from , except from wherever it happens to be coming in from at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 95 KRUPP Every once in a while I catch myself being mean , hating people just because they 're down and out , broke and hungry , sick or drunk . And then when I 'm with the stuffed shirts at headquarters , all of a sudden I 'm nice to them , trying to make an impression . On who ? People I do n't like . And I feel disgusted . ( With finality ) I 'm going to quit . That 's all . Quit . Out . I 'm going to give them back the uniform and the gadgets that go with it . I do n't want any part of it . This is a good world . What do they want to make all the trouble for all the time ? ARAB ( Quietly , gently , with great understanding ) No foundation . All the way down the line . KRUPP What ? ARAB No foundation . No foundation . KRUPP I 'll say there 's no foundation . ARAB All the way down the line . KRUPP ( To NICK ) Is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been saying this week . KRUPP What is he , anyway ? NICK He 's an Arab , or something like that . p. 96 KRUPP No , I mean what 's he do for a living ? NICK ( To ARAB ) What do you do for a living , brother ? ARAB Work . Work all my life . All my life , work . From small boy to old man , work . In old country , work . In new country , work . In New York . Pittsburgh . Detroit . Chicago . Imperial Valley . San Francisco . Work . No beg . Work . For what ? Nothing . Three boys in old country . Twenty years , not see . Lost . Dead . Who knows ? What . What-not . No foundation . All the way down the line . KRUPP What 'd he say last week ? NICK Did n't say anything . Played the harmonica . ARAB Old country song , I play . He brings a harmonica from his back pocket . KRUPP Seems like a nice guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bitterly ) But crazy . Just like all the rest of us . Stark raving mad . WESLEY and HARRY long ago stopped playing and dancing . They sat at a table together and talked for a while ; then began playing casino or rummy . When the ARAB begins his solo on the harmonica , they stop their game to listen . p. 97 WESLEY You hear that ? HARRY That 's something . WESLEY That 's crying . That 's crying . HARRY I want to make people laugh . WESLEY That 's deep , deep crying . That 's crying a long time ago . That 's crying a thousand years ago . Some place five thousand miles away . HARRY Do you think you can play to that ? WESLEY I want to sing to that , but I ca n't sing . HARRY You try and play to that . I 'll try to dance . WESLEY goes to the piano , and after closer listening , he begins to accompany the harmonica solo . HARRY goes to the little stage and after a few efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly for some time . KRUPP and NICK have been silent , and deeply moved . KRUPP ( Softly ) Well , anyhow , Nick . NICK Hmmmmmmm ? KRUPP What I said . Forget it . NICK Sure . KRUPP It gets me down once in a while . p. 98 NICK No harm in talking . KRUPP ( The POLICEMAN again , loudly ) Keep the girls out of here . NICK ( Loud and friendly ) Take it easy . The music and dancing are now at their height. @x That evening . Fog-horns are heard throughout the scene . A man in evening clothes and a top hat , and his woman , also in evening clothes , are entering . WILLIE is still at the marble game . NICK is behind the bar . JOE is at his table , looking at the book of maps of the countries of Europe . The box containing the revolver and the box containing the cartridges are on the table , beside his glass . He is at peace , his hat tilted back on his head , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar , dreaming of love and Kitty . The ARAB is gone . WESLEY and HARRY are gone . KIT CARSON is watching the boy at the marble game . SOCIETY LADY Oh , come on , please . The gentleman follows miserably . The SOCIETY MAN and WIFE take a table . NICK gives them a menu . Outside , in the street , the Salvation Army people are playing a song . Big drum , tambourines , cornet and singing . They are singing " The Blood of the Lamb . " The music and words come into the place faintly and comically . This is followed by an old sinner testifying . It is the DRUNKARD . His words are not intelligible , but his message is unmistakable . He is saved . He wants to sin no more . And so on . p. 100 DRUNK ( Testifying , unmistakably drunk ) Brothers and sisters . I was a sinner . I chewed tobacco and chased women . Oh , I sinned , brothers and sisters . And then I was saved . Saved by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see now . Here 's a city . Pribor . Czecho-slovakia . Little , lovely , lonely Czecho-slovakia . I wonder what kind of a place Pribor was ? ( Calling ) Pribor ! Pribor ! ( TOM leaps ) SOCIETY LADY What 's the matter with him ? S ( Crossing his legs , as if he ought to go to the men 's room ) Drunk . TOM Who you calling , Joe ? JOE Pribor . TOM Who 's Pribor ? JOE He 's Czech . And a Slav . A Czecho-slovakian . SOCIETY LADY How interesting . S ( Uncrosses legs ) He 's drunk . JOE Tom , Pribor 's a city in Czecho-slovakia . TOM Oh . ( Pause ) You sure were nice to her , Joe . p. 101 JOE Kitty Duval ? She 's one of the finest people in the world . TOM It sure was nice of you to hire an automobile and take us for a drive along the ocean-front and down to Half Moon Bay . JOE Those three hours were the most delightful , the most somber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TOM Why , Joe ? JOE Why ? I 'm a student . ( Lifting his voice ) Tom . ( Quietly ) I 'm a student . I study all things . All . All . And when my study reveals something of beauty in a place or in a person where by all rights only ugliness or death should be revealed , then I know how full of goodness this life is . And that 's a good thing to know . That 's a truth I shall always seek to verify . SOCIETY LADY Are you sure he 's drunk ? S ( Crossing his legs ) He 's either drunk , or just naturally crazy . TOM Joe ? JOE Yeah . TOM You wo n't get sore or anything ? JOE ( Impatiently ) What is it , Tom ? p. 102 TOM Joe , where do you get all that money ? You paid for the automobile . You paid for supper and the two bottles of champagne at the Half Moon Bay Restaurant . You moved Kitty out of the New York Hotel around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I saw you pay her rent . I saw you give her money for new clothes . Where do you get all that money , Joe ? Three years now and I 've never asked . JOE ( Looking at TOM sorrowfully , a little irritated , not so much with TOM as with the world and himself , his own superiority . He speaks clearly , slowly and solemnly ) Now do n't be a fool , Tom . Listen carefully . If anybody 's got any money  --  to hoard or to throw away  --  you can be sure he stole it from other people . Not from rich people who can spare it , but from poor people who ca n't . From their lives and from their dreams . I 'm no exception . I earned the money I throw away . I stole it like everybody else does . I hurt people to get it . Loafing around this way , I still earn money . The money itself earns more . I still hurt people . I do n't know who they are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd feel worse than I do . I 've got a Christian conscience in a world that 's got no conscience at all . The world 's trying to get some sort of a social conscience , but it 's having a devil of a time trying to do that . I 've got money . I 'll always have money , as long as this world stays the way it is . I do n't work . I do n't make anything . ( He sips ) I drink . I worked when I was a kid . I worked hard . I mean hard , Tom . People are supposed to enjoy living . I got tired . ( He lifts the gun and looks at it while he talks ) I decided to get even on the world . Well , you ca n't enjoy living unless you work . Unless you do something . I do n't do anything . I do n't want to do anything any more . There is n't anything I can do that wo n't make me feel embarrassed . Because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't the patience . And I 'm too smart . Money is the guiltiest thing in the world . It stinks . Now , do n't ever bother me about it again . p. 103 TOM I did n't mean to make you feel bad , Joe . JOE ( Slowly ) Here . Take this gun out in the street and give it to some worthy hold-up man . SOCIETY LADY What 's he saying ? S ( Uncrosses legs ) You wanted to visit a honky-tonk . Well , this is a honky-tonk . ( To the world ) Married twenty-eight years and she 's still looking for adventure . TOM How should I know who 's a hold-up man ? JOE Take it away . Give it to somebody . TOM ( Bewildered ) Do I have to give it to somebody ? JOE Of course . TOM Ca n't I take it back and get some of our money ? JOE Do n't talk like a business man . Look around and find somebody who appears to be in need of a gun and give it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? TOM The man said it was , but how can I tell who needs a gun ? JOE Tom , you 've seen good people who needed guns , have n't you ? p. 104 TOM I do n't remember . Joe , I might give it to the wrong kind of guy . He might do something crazy . JOE All right . I 'll find somebody myself . ( TOM rises ) Here 's some money . Go get me this week 's Life , Liberty , Time , and six or seven packages of chewing gum . TOM ( Swiftly , in order to remember each item ) Life , Liberty , Time , and six or seven packages of chewing gum ? JOE That 's right . TOM All that chewing gum ? What kind ? JOE Any kind . Mix'em up . All kinds . TOM Licorice , too ? JOE Licorice , by all means . TOM Juicy Fruit ? JOE Juicy Fruit . TOM Tutti-frutti ? JOE Is there such a gum ? TOM I think so . JOE All right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many kinds as they 're selling . TOM Life , Liberty , Time , and all the different kinds of gum . ( He begins to go ) p. 105 JOE ( Calling after him loudly ) Get some jelly beans too . All the different colors . TOM All right , Joe . JOE And the longest panatela cigar you can find . Six of them . TOM Panatela . I got it . JOE Give a news-kid a dollar . TOM O.K. , Joe . JOE Give some old man a dollar . TOM O.K. , Joe . JOE Give them Salvation Army people in the street a couple of dollars and ask them to sing that song that goes  --  ( He sings loudly ) Let the lower lights be burning , send a gleam across the wave . TOM ( Swiftly ) Let the lower lights be burning , send a gleam across the wave . JOE That 's it . ( He goes on with the song , very loudly and religiously ) Some poor , dying , struggling seaman , you may rescue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe . I got it . Life , Liberty , Time , all the kinds of gum they 're selling , jelly beans , six panatela cigars , a dollar for a news-kid , a dollar for an old man , two dollars for the Salvation Army . ( Going ) Let the lower lights be burning , send a gleam across the wave . p. 106 JOE That 's it . SOCIETY LADY He 's absolutely insane . S ( Wearily crossing legs ) You asked me to take you to a honky-tonk , instead of to the Mark Hopkins . You 're here in a honky-tonk . I ca n't help it if he 's crazy . Do you want to go back to where people are n't crazy ? SOCIETY LADY No , not just yet . S Well , all right then . Do n't be telling me every minute that he 's crazy . SOCIETY LADY You need n't be huffy about it . MAN refuses to answer , uncrosses legs . When JOE began to sing , KIT CARSON turned away from the marble game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he comes over to Joe 's table . CARSON Presbyterian ? JOE I attended a Presbyterian Sunday School . CARSON Fond of singing ? JOE On occasion . Have a drink ? CARSON Thanks . JOE Get a glass and sit down . KIT CARSON gets a glass from NICK , returns to the table , sits down , JOE pours him a drink , they touch glasses just as the Salvation Army people begin to fulfill the request . They sip some champagne , and at the proper moment begin to sing the song together , sipping champagne , raising hell with the tune , swinging it , and so on . The SOCIETY LADY joins them , and is stopped by her HUSBAND.Always was fond of that song . Used to sing it at the top of my voice . Never saved a seaman in my life . p. 107 CARSON ( Flirting with the SOCIETY LADY who loves it ) I saved a seaman once . Well , he was n't exactly a seaman . He was a darky named Wellington . Heavy-set sort of a fellow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not until I came along , at any rate . In New Orleans . In the summer of the year 1899 . No . Ninety-eight . I was a lot younger of course , and had no mustache , but was regarded by many people as a man of means . JOE Know anything about guns ? CARSON ( Flirting ) All there is to know . Did n't fight the Ojibways for nothing . Up there in the Lake Takalooca Country , in Michigan . ( Remembering ) Along about in 1881 or two . Fought ' em right up to the shore of the Lake . Made ' em swim for Canada . One fellow in particular , an Indian named Harry Daisy . JOE ( Opening the box containing the revolver ) What sort of a gun would you say this is ? Any good ? CARSON ( At sight of gun , leaping ) Yep . That looks like a pretty nice hunk of shooting iron . That 's a six-shooter . Shot a man with a six-shooter once . Got him through the palm of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend . Thought it was a bird . Fellow named , I believe , Carroway . Larrimore Carroway. p. 108 JOE Know how to work one of these things ? He offers KIT CARSON the revolver , which is old and enormous . CARSON ( Laughing at the absurd question ) Know how to work it ? Hand me that little gun , son , and I 'll show you all about it.JOE hands KIT the revolver . ( Importantly ) Let 's see now . This is probably a new kind of six-shooter . After my time . Have n't nicked an Indian in years . I believe this here place is supposed to move out . ( He fools around and gets the barrel out for loading ) That 's it . There it is . JOE Look all right ? CARSON It 's a good gun . You 've got a good gun there , son . I 'll explain it to you . You see these holes ? Well , that 's where you put the cartridges . JOE ( Taking some cartridges out of the box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CARSON ( A little impatiently ) Well , son , you take ' em one by one and put ' em in the holes , like this . There 's one . Two . Three . Four . Five . Six . Then you get the barrel back in place . Then cock it . Then all you got to do is aim and fire . He points the gun at the LADY and GENTLEMAN who scream and stand up , scaring KIT CARSON into paralysis . The gun is loaded , but uncocked. p. 109 JOE It 's all set ? CARSON Ready to kill . JOE Let me hold it . KIT hands JOE the gun . The LADY and GENTLEMAN watch , in terror . CARSON Careful , now , son . Do n't cock it . Many a man 's lost an eye fooling with a loaded gun . Fellow I used to know named Danny Donovan lost a rose . Ruined his whole life . Hold it firm . Squeeze the trigger . Do n't snap it . Spoils your aim . JOE Thanks . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins to unload it ) CARSON Of course you can . JOE unloads the revolver , looks at it very closely , puts the cartridges back into the box . JOE ( Looking at gun ) I 'm mighty grateful to you . Always wanted to see one of those things close up . Is it really a good one ? CARSON It 's a beaut , son . JOE ( Aims the empty gun at a bottle on the bar ) Bang ! FAROUGHLI ( At the marble game , as the machine groans ) Oh , Boy ! ( Loudly , triumphantly ) There you are , Nick . Thought I could n't do it , hey ? Now , watch . The machine begins to make a special kind of noise . Lights go on and off . Some red , some green . A bell rings loudly six times.One . Two . Three . Four . Five . Six . An American flag jumps up . WILLIE comes to attention . Salutes.Oh , boy , what a beautiful country . A loud music-box version of the song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LADY get to their feet . ( Singing ) My country , ' t is of thee , sweet land of liberty , of thee I sing . Everything quiets down . The flag goes back into the machine . WILLIE is thrilled , amazed , delighted . EVERYBODY has watched the performance of the defeated machine from wherever he happened to be when the performance began . WILLIE , looking around at everybody , as if they had all been on the side of the machine.O.K . How 's that ? I knew I could do it . ( To NICK ) Six nickels . NICK hands him six nickels . WILLIE goes over to JOE and KIT.Took me a little while , but I finally did it . It 's scientific , really . With a little skill a man can make a modest living beating the marble games . Not that that 's what I want to do . I just do n't like the idea of anything getting the best of me . A machine or anything else . Myself , I 'm the kind of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then goes to work and does it . There 's no other way a man can be a success at anything . ( Indicating the letter " F " on his sweater ) See that letter ? That do n't stand for some little-bitty high school somewhere . That stands for me . Faroughli . Willie Faroughli . I 'm an Assyrian . We 've got a civilization six or seven centuries old , I think . Somewhere along in there . Ever hear of Osman ? Harold Osman ? He 's an Assyrian , too . He 's got an orchestra down in Fresno . ( He goes to the LADY and GENTLEMAN ) I 've never seen you before in my life , but I can tell from the clothes you wear and the company you keep ( Graciously indicating the LADY ) that you 're a man who looks every problem straight in the eye , and then goes to work and solves it . I 'm that way myself . Well . ( He smiles beautifully , takes the GENTLEMAN 'S hand furiously ) It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a change . Well . I 'll be seeing you . So long . ( He turns , takes two steps , returns to the table . Very politely and seriously ) Good-by , lady . You 've got a good man there . Take good care of him . WILLIE goes , saluting JOE and the world . p. 110 CARSON ( To JOE ) By God , for a while there I did n't think that young Assyrian was going to do it . That fellow 's got something . TOM comes back with the magazines and other stuff . JOE Get it all ? TOM Yeah . I had a little trouble finding the jelly beans . JOE Let 's take a look at them . TOM These are the jelly beans . JOE puts his hand into the cellophane bag and takes out a handful of the jelly beans , looks at them , smiles , and tosses a couple into his mouth . JOE Same as ever . Have some .
