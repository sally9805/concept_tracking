txt Quietly in the gathering dusk late yesterday afternoon the New York Municipal Airport at North Beach , Queens , opened the record book of service to international aviation . First among countless thousands of aircraft from foreign lands expected to use the terminus was an American Airlines flagship bearing six ranking Canadian Government officials invited to attend the formal dedication ceremonies today . George McCabe , chief pilot of the line , set his wheels on the 6,000-yard Number 1 runway at 5:11 o'clock after a fast flight from Ottawa . The plane appeared to lie suspended over the rim of the airport , seemingly motionless for a moment , then it settled gently to earth . Customs and immigration men moved out of the sheltered loading platform to perform a duty that will be repeated for passengers from Europe , Bermuda and South America . Mayor 's Aide Greets Visitors C. D. Howe , Minister of Transportation , accepted the official welcome of Stanley Howe on behalf of Mayor La Guardia . The Canadian exclaimed : " Beautiful , perfectly beautiful , is n't it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. Ralston , Minister of Finance ; J. A. , Minister Without Portfolio ; Senator N. L. Lambert , Commander C. P. Edwards , chief of the air services , and Peter Coolican , Assistant Deputy Postmaster General . Douglas Cole , Canadian Trade Commissioner in this city ; John , Dock Commissioner , and C. R. Smith , president of the airline , joined the official party . The visitors had a motor-cycle police escort to the Ritz Carlton Hotel . The field was ready for their inspection , as it will be today when some 150,000 persons converge on it by automobile , bus and trolley . Mayor La Guardia drove the job through to completion at this time despite innumerable delays . Speaking over station WABC at 8:30 o'clock last night the Mayor issued an invitation to the whole world to come and see this air terminal , which , he forecast , would play a role in the development of the air commerce of tomorrow similar to that played by the seaport of New York today . " It is a symbol of the coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is an airport unsurpassed and even unrivaled in utility , capacity , safety , convenience and beauty . " Three miles of runways stand out clean and smooth against a background of fresh green grass , while a triple set of hangars is ready for use and the administration building is polished and carpeted . Mr. laughed at expressions of surprise about the healthy turf of the field . " Why not ? It 's laid on the finest fertilizer , 17,000,000 cubic yards of New York refuse , " he said . Consternation Over Error Pride almost had a fall in the last minutes before the Canadians arrived . The trip was symbolic of the transition from Newark to New York , with the international touch added . Mr. McCabe departed from the New Jersey airport yesterday morning on a flight to North Beach via Ottawa . When he was known to be circling the World 's Fair , two miles to the south , word was rushed from the control tower , that the distinguished entourage would land in Newark . The assembled city and airline executives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the first commercial base in the city , experienced a few mo-1 ments of consternation . However , an explanation came a few seconds ahead of the plane . The co-pilot innocently had voiced his mistaken opinion . Gordon Hamilton sat in the swivel chair of the North Beach control tower throughout the day , directing pilots on their landing . He it was who had announced almost casually : " They 're going to Newark . " Army and navy aircraft visited the field to test its facilities for handling about eighty service planes today . Roger Wolfe Kahn paid a courtesy call in a Lockheed Electra from Roosevelt Field , whence Lindbergh took off for Europe . A special treat was reserved for the first passenger arrival . Owing to the fading light , the . field 's system of illumination was turned on . Flush contact lamps set close to the runways marked the lane in golden gleams , red warning signals shone at the edge of Flushing and Bowery Bays , and the giant beacon atop the administration building revolved slowly . Yet , unseen at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruddy , cloud-banked sunset . Dr. A. E. Balboni , in charge of quarantine and immigration , and W. B. Mitchell and Harold Adams , customs inspectors , set precedents in quarters reserved for the Mayor . Hereafter they will work in offices so devised that air travelers can move progressively from the field to their waiting friends or drive direct , in twenty minutes , to midtown New York . Actually , however , something was missing from the inaugural flight . It was charted and exempt from regulations covering normal , scheduled transport operations . The airlines must withhold service until the Civil Aeronautics Authority grants certificates of convenience on their plea to move from Newark to North Beach . This step is regarded as routine , inasmuch as the CAA approved the Queens airport in construction . American Airlines , United Air Lines , Transcontinental &; Western Air , Inc. , and Pan American Airways are cooperating with the city administration . The first three companies have mentioned next month as a likely starting date for limited service from North Beach . Pan American may defer bringing its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic Clipper will be on view at the seaplane base today .

Scores of army and navy planes are scheduled to land before the speaking program is held between 1 and 3 o'clock . Those at the western end of the airport will witness the arrival of the Atlantic Clipper . Two hundred and fifty aircraft will land and take off in the interval of a few hours . North Beach can be reached by automobile via the Grand Central Parkway from either the Triborough Bridge or the World 's Fair . Special bus connections will be provided at many points . Direct trolley service runs from the Junction Boulevard station of the I. R. T. and B. M. T. Flushing lines . Mayor La Guardia in his radio address last night recited the steps in his long fight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the building of Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn , finally the leasing of North Beach from CurtissWright and the construction of the great airport . " Did the politicians , and others complain ? " he asked jeeringly . " First they said it would never be completed , then if it was completed it never would be tenanted ; if tenanted , no one could fly out of here . " It is with pardonable pride we announce to the whole world that this effort of ours now is complete and that tomorrow we dedicate it to the public use . New York airport was designed for the aviation of tomorrow , built for operation today , and is opened to the traveling public in the sincere hope it will fill a place in American aviation long needed and play its part in helping to advance this most modern of man 's means of conquering time and space . " The Mayor listed many of the distinguished guests who would be present for today 's ceremonies but added that the main guests of honor , in his eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who , with their families , were to be there as his guests .
