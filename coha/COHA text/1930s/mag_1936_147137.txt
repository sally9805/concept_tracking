Bengal Tiger ( Warner ) injects into circus formula No. 1-about the lion tamer ( Barton MacLane ) , the lion tamer 's wife ( June Travis ) and the handsome young man on the flying trapeze ( Warren Hull ) - one new and valuable factor . Satan , meanest tiger in captivity , chews off the lion tamer 's right leg at the picture 's start , obligingly devours what remains of him at the finish . Between times he prowls down a village street , goes on a rampage in a butcher shop , makes kindling out of innumerable kitchen chairs , kills a substitute keeper , growling the while in a complacent undertone . <P> The role of Satan in Bengal Tiger was largely performed by a tiger actually named Satan and actually reputed to be the meanest in captivity .

Bill saw them have their first epochal quarrel , on the way home from the Tunney-Dempsey fight in Philadelphia , and knew that they were fighting fundamentally because Mary wanted to get more fun out of life while Jock wanted to make more money . Bill saw true love withstand marital unfaithfulness ; he even tried to help it withstand the end of Jock 's prosperity in 1929 . When the rehabilitating spirit of 1935 reached the alcohol-sodden and philandering Jock , Mary felt she had a right to leave him , since he did not need her any more .
