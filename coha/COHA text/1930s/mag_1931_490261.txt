THE Judge Clark decision that the Eighteenth Amendment was invalid caused one young man to reflect on its connotations . If the Eighteenth Amendment is invalid , so also is the Thirteenth , prohibiting slavery . This would be a swell break , he claims , for the colored musical revues that crop up now and again : the casts could be held in bondage , fed , clothed , and housed by the management in quarters backstage , paid no salary , and whipped when the gags do n't click . We do n't know what to think about the matter ; it 's really up to the Supreme Court . THE papers of course printed the full text of the Pope 's encyclical about marriage and birth control and divorce . The whole document occupied about twenty-four newspaper columns , which is a lot of columns . Only the President of the United States could have got as much space : Pope Pius and Mr. Hoover , it strikes us , are the only two public non-criminal per-suns in the world whom the papers allow to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper , we would have hesitated in publishing the encyclical simply on the ground that it was n't news . If Rome had changed its mind about marriage or divorce , that would have been news for at least twenty-four columns . Yet , for all that , we read every word of the document ; we read it , though nearly every linebranded us a sinner . Two factors made it hold our attention  --  first , that it was entirely based on Divine law with a capital " D " rather than on human law with its small but appealing little " h ; " and second , that it had been dictated by a man who , whatever else he was , was not married . These two things made it continuously interesting and important as a point of view . What Pope Pius seemed to us to have missed completely about Christian marriage was this : that , with all its falling from grace , it is still a lot of fun ; more fun than practically any other form of institutionalized living , more fun than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that almost everyone still believes in it pretty thoroughly , even the most violent reformers and renovators . Rome never said a word about that , and missed a big chance . TAR/OUTS people have been pro-viding us with charts , maps , graphs , and statistics showing exactly what happens to the country during hard times . It is a matter of fairly common knowledge that in periods of business depression the death rate drops markedly . Fewer people die in hard times than in good times . The National Casket Company will tell you that , if you feel like talking shop . Another thing that seems to happen is that appendicitis operations increase during crash years . People do n't die but they get appendicitis and have to be operated on . Minor operations like tonsils seem to fall off , however , and doctors ' business in general has fallen off sharply in the past year  --  doctors and dentists both . People consult medical men only when they really feel had . Apparently this makes for national health , as the death-rate curve indicates . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nail in your coffin , because it is a luxury and gets you down . All this makes us think that there is some comfort in feeling pinched ; we should all try to remember it as a little lesson in living . Watch that appendix , though ! It may blow up any minute . OO NE time , in an expansive mood , V- , we suggested that our bank give a cocktail party , so we could meet the tellers socially and get to know them . The idea seems to have taken hold  --  not of our own bank but of the Lenox Hill branch of the Bank of America . That bank served tea on December 9 , from five to seven . Of course , our suggestion was cocktails , not tea , but Lenox Hill , after all , is the centre of the tea-drinking belt and probably the bank knew what it was doing . Wre started to go to this tea , to examine the effects of a hookup between charm and finance , but we got only as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party was in progress upstairs in a director 's room , and that we would have to leave our hat and coat on the main floor in charge of a bank attendant . Not us , thank you ! Who would identify us , later on , when we wanted to get our hat back ? Vie were n't going to go through t1w by golly . Announcement WE were n't present personally at a formal dinner given at the White House a few weeks ago for a rather large gathering , but one who was tells us of a slip-up which , taken good-naturedly at the time , thawed out this function sooner than most such affairs get thawed , and as many never are . Some sixty distinguished guests were assembled , awaiting the entrance of Mr. and Mrs. Hoover , when a door was opened and a functionary appeared , just as NVhite House ceremony prescribes . He entered the room Mrs. Coolidge . " Reversed AN elderly and particularly dignified lady , whom advancing age has left a little shaky of memory and quite deaf , lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of her failings , she insists on going about a good deal alone , though she does consent to carry with her a bit of paper with the address of her destination written out as a jog to her own memory in case she might forget . It also helps with taxi-drivers who might not understand her , and of course could never make her understand them . Well , the other day there was a motion picture showing downtown she particularly wanted to see , Accordingly , she had the cook clip an advertisement of the theatre from the newspaper and started off , hailed a taxi , and handed the driver the clipping . The driver gazed at it with a curious kind of awe , glanced hack at the lady sitting calmly in the cab , blushed deeply , turned again , and studied the paper . Finally , shaking his head in a puzzled but reproving sort of way , he opened the glass partition and handed the paper back to her . It was then the lady realized that in her haste she had handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contained the caption of what had apparently been a large advertisement . It said " How Is Your Liver ? " Coloratura WHENWHEN she was finally alone on the Saturday evening following her success at the Metropolitan Opera House in the afternoon , Lily Pons insisted on singing some of the " Lucia " part again because she was sure she had n't done her best with it at her de-hut performance . Meanwhile people were trying to get in to kiss her , photographers were clamoring for pictures , and critics were searching for new adjectives . It had all come unexpectedly . Whereas Marion Talley 's debut had been much ballyhooed , Mme. Pons ' was announced only by a small ad . When she sang Gilda a few nights later she got thirty curtain calls . Just about a year ago Mine . Pons was singing Lucia in the town of Montpellier in southern France . She caused no hullabaloo there except in the breast of one gentleman in the audience , Giovanni Zenatello , the tenor , who had stopped off in Montpellier on his way from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might find a new singer of promise in the local opera company . He wildly urged Mine . Pons to come to America for an audition at the Metropolitan . She arrived here last March , bewildered and underweight . What with seasickness and one thing and another , she was reduced from a hundred and five pounds to ninety . Zenatello and his wife spent ten days supervising the building up of her health . She is n't frail , but tiny , being less than five feet tall . She had her audition March 20 . Gatti , Gigli , and others pricked up their ears when they heard her sing and telephoned to Mr. Kahn to come a-running . He did , listened to her , and right there approved of her being engaged . She went to Italy , accompanied by her husband , a Dutch authority on economies and to prepare for her debut here . This preparation included many hours of practice and having her appendix out . Mme. Pons was born in Cannes of an Italian mother and a French father who played the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Paris at thirteen . She left there three years later , having won the first prize . She spent two years in playing ingenue parts at the Thatre des Varietes , and might have become an actress if she had n't heard Claudia Muzio sing in " Traviata . " This inspired her to become an opera singer and she started at it immediately . She appeared first at Mulhouse , France , and continued to sing in the French provinces until Zenatello found her . She designs all her own costumes and goes in for animals as pets . Her husband says she would keep an elephant in her apartment if she could figure out a way of getting him in . Work for Idle Hands ANEIGHBOR whose windows overlook the roof-terrace of the Arthur Curtiss James house in East Sixty-ninth Street was puzzled by a curious manifestation there . This was the appearance on the roof , early one morning , of three men who seemed to he dressed for work , but who spent the entire day sitting with an air of deep concentration at a table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his bewilderment , the neighbor got out field glasses to have a closer view , and discovered to his still greater astonishment that the men were solemnly playing backgammon . Maddened by curiosity at this , he called up the Jameses and demanded an explanation . It was really quite simple . Commodore James , with the idea in mind of helping the unemployed , had hired three deserving fellows downtown and sent them up to the house . When they arrived , however , nothing much could be found for them to do , so they had been given a backgammon board and sent up to the roof . Riker 's Rats /-THE rats , the pigs , the everlasting fires , the rubbish , and the convicts of Riker 's Island are all just as the papers say . We made a quick trip over to the Island to check up . There are five million rats , exactly . The fire has burned in the rubbish for twenty years without interruption . There arc five hundred convicts , and one thousand pigs . Sixteen scowloads of rubbish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few rats come along with each load for the ride . The menace is a real one : rats are no joke  --  the United States Public Health Service has estimated that two rats , reproducing over a period of five years , will increase from two rats to 940,369,969,152 rats provided the parents are healthy and fond of each other , and no little rats die . The Riker 's Island colony is the biggest in the world . Some of the rats weigh five pounds . They will attack pigs , dogs , and human beings , and make good . The prisoners and wardens on the Island carry clubs , if they arc abroad at night . Wardell Morehead , of the Municipal Farm , carries a gun during the daytime and takes pot shots for amusement . The city admits it would be impossible to exterminate the rats completely  --  all they hope to do is keep the total down . They 've tried everything . Husky dogs were brought over , but the dogs were cordial to the rats , and ate the pigs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Recently , though , progress has been made : a man named Billig , of 303 Fifth Avenue , is at work on the Island with poison imported from Germany  --  a brown liquid with the odor of anise . Rats dote on it . It makes them run for water , and the more water they drink the quicker they go belly up . Mr. Billiry says they choke to death . He himself rather likes the poison  --  takes swigs of it now and then to show it does n't hurt humans . The city has made a deal to pay him twenty thousand dollars for a period ending next May , and his results are impressive : he has killed up to thirty-five hundred a day . The Island , which lies back of Hell Gate , is largely synthetic  --  its present four hundred acres are almost all importations . Years ago it was just a swampy little place , unpopulated . Now look at it ! The fires keep it comfortably warm even in winter ; snow melts almost the moment it hits the rubbish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make as little impression on the fires as the dogs made on the rats . Life goes on pleasantly  --  t e convicts take care of the pigs , the wardens take care of t h e convicts , spontaneous combustion takes care of the fires , and rubbish takes care of the rats . Everybody is happy and only a handful of rats annually swim over to Long Island to bother people who are fussy . Ground will soon be broken ? and it breaks easily over there ? for a fine big penitentiary to take the place of the one on Welfare Island . Then Welfare Island will become a park . ' leers soon found a simpler explanation . Unless you talked for ten seconds after making a dial connection , the automatic apparatus which charged you for the call did n't register it ; it did n't work fast enough . And big corporations are n't Santa Clauses . The girls at MEridian 7-12I2 gave out the time so speedily that they were giving it out free . At first the Company thought of having the girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they worked out a way to speed up the recording machinery . The Time Service Department now handles about fifty thousand calls a day . You can figure that out at live cents a call . At present it employs twenty operators , but they 've been working on this and soon will cut the staff to one . They will put this one young lady in a glass-inclosed booth and every ten seconds she will chant into a transmitter : " The time is now such and such , " thus answering all the calls that have accumulated in that space of time . The next step will probably be to put in a phonograph . Pranksters have unearthed a new telephone joke which everyone ought to be warned against . They call up their victims and leave a message which sounds important and the admonition to call , say , BRyant 9-9970 . Now the number 9970 is so wired on Bryant and all the other dialled exchanges as to give the busy signal perpetually . It 's for testing purposes or something . Hence the victim can call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This works only on the exchanges now included in the dial system ; on the others it 's a legitimate number still and people just get mad when you call them up . New dials are being manufactured which will carry the letter " Z. " It will be in the space with the zero and will be used for zone dialling , which will soon be upon us . At some future date all territory fairly near New York will be on the dial system and such places as Long Island , New Jersey , upstate New York , etc. , will be divided into zones . " Z " stands for " zone , " a happy coincidence . You 'll dial " ZJ " for New Jersey , " ZL " for Long Island , and so on . When they get around to real long-distance dialling , it will involve ten or more whirls of the dial . That is all for this week , except that if you ever feel contrary you may use the red " 0 , " or zero , instead of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same results . The telephone is wired that way . Skookum DOZENS of apple stories are sent us and are burned up , but it seems worth while to tell of the special service provided by the vendor on the Franklin Simon corner of Fifth Avenue . Over his right shoulder hangs a manila cord , one end of which is attached to the chute of the mailbox behind him . When he sees a pedestrian approaching with a letter , he jerks down the flap with a bang  --  and usually makes a sale . Then there is the story of the lady who has practically everything in life except a mind and who , with a friend , was walking down Park Avenue . As they passed an apple-seller she said " You know , my dear , I have never seen such beautiful apples as one finds on every corner . I should love to have one . " Her companion , astonished , said " Why do n't you buy some ? " The other was indignant . " But , my dear Alice , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uniforms 1 ? 4 ? TOT many people know it , and we I. wish you would n't spread it around too much yourself , but there is n't anybody named Brooks in the Brooks Costume Company , costumers to masqueraders as well as to the theatrical profession . Stroock is the name of the founder of the company , Ely Stroock . He adopted Brooks because it was easier to pronounce and less likely to confuse people than his own name . He is a tall , gaunt gentleman well into his sixties , and costuming nowadays is much more a hobby with him than a business . Not long ago , for example , he bought the Mrs. Ogden Goelet Collection of nineteenth-century gowns from the Duchess of Roxburghe . The collection includes every party dress worn by a Goelet from 1873 to 1902 , eighteen hundred and fifty gowns in all , and he paid a great price for it . He does n't expect to make any money out of it ; he 'll probably present it to some museum some day . He also owns the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all other collectors when H. J. Heinz , the pickle man , died . His chief pride , however , is his collection of uniforms , which ranges from a Japanese fighting kimono to the full panoply of a Senegalese warrior and covers pretty much everything in between . He has the field baton , solid gold , which Napoleon carried . It probably will go to the Metropolitan Museum when he dies . Meanwhile , Mr. Stroock 's great ambition is to be able to produce on demand an authentic example of any garment you may ask for , no matter where worn or when , in the last thousand years . He pretty nearly lives up to it , too . A year or so ago , for instance , while doing costumes for the cast of " Soldiers and Women , " it became necessary to find out what kind of regalia was worn by a certain British regiment in India in 1904 . Stroock had the uniform in stock , but some of the insignia were missing . The producer was willing to let such details slide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an agent there go through the army archives , and send him complete data on the correct trappings . Another demand that stumped him for a time was made by Mr. Leo Singer , the midget man . He wanted to get his midgets outfitted with suits of armor . Stroock had all sorts of outfits worn by pigmy and dwarf court jesters in the Middle Ages , but no armor . Midgets , in those days , apparently never went to war . Eventually , he had to have his experts make up miniature sets of armor , copied after the suits in the Metropolitan . They turned out such a good job of it that when the midgets finished their season 's tour , Stroock bought their outfits back again , to add to his collection . Checkmate WE are told of an apparently authentic adventure of two prohibition agents and a taxi-driver with an opinion of his own and the sixth sense with which taxi-drivers are reputed to be endowed . Posing as strangers in the city , the government men asked the cabman to take them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He smiled pleasantly when they winked a couple of times , and nodded knowingly . The cab started uptown . It passed Columbus Circle , going out Broadway . It passed Seventy-second Street . It passed Ninety-sixth Street . It evidently would have passed a lot more streets if the agents had n't got apprehensive and hollered " Hey , where you taking us ? " " To Canada , " the driver said briefly .
