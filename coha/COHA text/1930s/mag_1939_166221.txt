By error , the 1937 Moody 's Manual of Investments quoted the stock of the New Jersey Title Guarantee &; Trust Co. , sixth largest bank in Jersey City , at $974 a share instead of $9 . The bank 's president , Walter Pennett Gardner , was formerly judge of the New Jersey Court of Errors &; Appeals . Last fortnight word began to filter about Jersey City that these were not the only errors involved in the bank 's history . <P> Quietly , persistently , depositors appeared at the bank 's main office and five branches , demanded their money . In three days the bank dished out $2,179,280 . N. J. Title Guarantee &; Trust still had over a million in cash on hand , but it did not open for business again . With $21,500,000 in deposits still on its books , it was the biggest bank failure in five years . Reason : under Boss Frank Hague , Jersey City 's tax rate on real estate is the highest in the U. S. and the bank 's assets were frozen with $21,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenements and factories . <P> Time was when such an event would have brought cursing crowds banging at the doors of the bank 's red brick building , when local payrolls would have stopped , local taxes gone unpaid , a resounding local depression started . But after the 1933 Bank Holiday , the New Deal set up Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . Since then banks have paid .08% of their average daily deposits to FDIC , thus insuring all deposits of $5,000 or less . <P> Last week when FDIChairman Leo Crowley announced that $17,000,000 of the $21,500,000 loss was completely covered , that another million consisted of uninvested trust funds that were fully secured , Jersey City knew it had only a stomachache , not appendicitis.
