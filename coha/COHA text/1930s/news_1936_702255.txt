txt Bewildered Subway Patrons Railroad companies out of the city direct their passengers by well-placed boards at the separate platforms on which are designated the train name , its destination , also the station stops en route . It is strongly to be wished that the city subway companies would adopt a similar plan and place large boards in very conspicuous positions in every station listing all the train stops on the line and headed by the corresponding train name that appears in the car windows . If a person having lived in this city upward of fifty years is nonplused in the subways , what must be the plight of visiting strangers ? When there were platform men throughout the day and a full complement of guards on the trains , directions were always at hand , but at present the inexperienced riders are distressingly confounded . Take this also as a World 's Fair forethought in that it would be condemnatory to have the subways crowded with a distraught and bewildered visiting people .
