Had King Edward VIII and his advisers not decided to send an overwhelming expeditionary force to Palestine and bestowed the most extraordinary dictatorial powers of life &; death upon Lieut . General John Greer Dill , when they ordered him to put an end to the Arab general strike ( TIME , Oct. 5 ) , the Arabs by now would quite possibly have slit most of the Jewish throats in that country . <P> Somewhat surprisingly , therefore , London 's New Zionist Organization , far from expressing gratitude to General Dill and the British Government in Palestine , last week launched the severest criticism of both . <P> Declared the New Zionists : " The fact that 80 Jews were murdered and hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of Jewish property destroyed under a British Administration should not be allowed to pass quietly . . . . British quarters have announced the stoppage of the strike through the medium of a declaration by General Dill in command of the troops in Palestine . The terms of this declaration are probably without precedent in British history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each other only by sovereign states at war with each other . General Dill has actually conceded to the Arabs the terms of an armistice in which the British forces are withdrawn from patrol in the affected areas for a given period , allowing the Arab bands to demobilize , conceal their arms and hide their identity in the villages . " <P> Having thus disposed of General Dill , the New Zionists next proceeded to belabor British Colonial Secretary Ormsby-Gore and his department : " The Palestine Government has chosen to permit the threat of outbreak and violence to remain poised over the heads of Palestine Jewry . With more than 20,000 British troops at its disposal in Palestine , it has treated with the leaders of the revolt , failed to disarm the Arab gangs , failed to establish a water-tight system of frontier-control . . . . " <P> Last but not least to be included in this Jewish denunciation was British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden whose diplomatic representatives , it was darkly declared , " have not been inactive at the courts of the Arab princes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
