Maria Jeritza , well-fed and tanned a warm ecru by a summer on the estate of Baron Leopold von Popper , near Vienna , returned to the U. S. last week . Schnurri II , white cat that she carried to all her performances at the Metropolitan Opera last year , she left behind . She languishes , she said , for Schnurri and the other estate animals-Schnurri 's summer lay of kittens ; horses , police dogs , dachshund , and a little white lamb . Husband von Popper , gallant and taller than Jeritza , escorted her to San Francisco where she is to sing in a pre-season Tannhuser and Salome . There he was to leave her and return to Vienna until the end of the New York Metropolitan season , which , he remarked , will be the last he will permit her .
