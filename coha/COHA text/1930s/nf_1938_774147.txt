txt  | at the same time objective wrongness is and remains objective in the argument . There are indeed few things in the world which make us so eager to interfere as wrongness in objective contexts . Too easily , in cases of aesthetics for instance , two such facts of requiredness , one objective and one subjective , are confused , one might almost say , telescoped into each other in the theorist 's mind . To summarize our discussion of requiredness : It is not the subjective aspect of requiredness in human striving and interests which makes requiredness compatible with facts . Instead it is the observation that certain facts do not only happen or exist , but , issuing as vectors in parts of contexts , extend toward others with a quality of acceptance or rejection . That in many examples such vectors issue from the self is a relatively minor point . Its discussion does not belong to the interpretation of requiredness as such ; it belongs , rather , to the geography of requiredness , in which the problem is : where do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ token subjective requiredness loses its apparent commonplace character . Its essential feature is still hidden from our eyes so long as the term striving , without closer inspection of its meaning , is held to solve the problem . So much is implied in facts of striving that they can not be regarded as trivial in the present phase of psychology . After this has once been realized we shall be less inclined to regard the subjective case as particularly simple , as necessarily basic in the treatment of requiredness . There is no a priori reason why this should be so or why , if there are other cases , the subjective variety should be given an outstanding place . If our phenomenological attempt has been adequate , no such restriction to subjective requiredness and no theoretical accentuation of it can be defended . It seems to be a special case only . In the  | following chapters , therefore , requiredness as the vectoraspect of phenomenal contexts will be taken in its general meaning . At least , it will not be regarded as a constitutive trait of requiredness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the self . With these remarks we conclude our phenomenological survey of requiredness . It has been elementary throughout , and the reader may be assured that I do not regard these observations as an adequate basis for ethics or for other systematic disciplines of value . In our survey many different cases of requiredness were considered impartially , and each by itself . In actual life one requiredness is often the enemy of another , and ethics , for instance , claims that , in its field , it can settle such disputes . No basis for such a procedure has been given in this chapter . I hope very much that here again the same phenomenological method will be helpful . In fact , if one particular demand objects to another , this situation itself is one of requiredness . When studying it the phenomenologist will soon find himself in the field of ethics . But for the purpose of the present investigation we need not solve this task . Requiredness in general will be considered in the next chapters as it was in the last .  | IT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of phenomenological description . To find the place of values in a world of facts is a task which has two different sides . First , there is the problem of principle : If experience gives us facts , how , in the same experience , can we find a place for requiredness ? Like all questions of fundamental principle this problem can only be solved on phenomenological grounds . In a preliminary way it seems to be solved by the observation that " fact " is an ambiguous term , that not all facts are " indifferent facts , " and that within certain factual contexts the requiredness or wrongness of some facts is no less real than is the existence of these facts . We have thus given to values a logical place among the facts . The second side of our task refers to a question of distribution . Experience in general has many domains . Where among these do we find requiredness as a characteristic of definite contexts ? Until now our approach had to be phenomenological , so that the term " requiredness " could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer necessary . Phenomenology is the field in which all concepts find their final justification . To what fields such concepts may be applied , once their meaning has been elucidated , is another question . And it is the aim of the next chapters to decide whether requiredness  | as we have now defined it has any place outside the phenomenal realm . As a matter of fact , even in our phenomenological P analysis we could not avoid questions of distribution altogether . We were answering a question of this kind when we came to the conclusion that requiredness occurs on the objective side of the phenomenal world no less than as a correlate of subjective striving . The domain of requiredness was thereby greatly enlarged . In order to avoid misunderstandings , however , we should add one more remark at this point about the distribution of requiredness in the phenomenal realm : We can not possibly maintain that the phenomenal world is permeated throughout by requiredness . We should not be able to speak about " mere facts , " this term would have no meaning for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or occurred indifferently . Indeed , not all sequences , not all constellations of experience , contain demanding vectors . Any number of examples could be given where no such vectors are apparent . Mixed on the color wheel in adequate proportions , red and green yield a grey . Nobody who watches the disappearance of the red and the green , the appearance of the grey , could seriously contend that grey is felt to be required at this point in the sequence . Similarly , no afterimage is felt to be demanded by those experiences which it follows , however regularly such a sequence may be observed . Besides , and more generally , concrete and circumscribed contexts in mental life are not as a rule experienced as parts of one large superordinated organization , which extends all through the individual 's life and in which each particular context appears as required or as wrong . In actual fact , nobody 's life has this much coherence . In so far , then , as many contexts are apparently  | indifferent to each other their common occurrence in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found within such particular contexts . From the empirical point of view , therefore , a " monism of requiredness " in the phenomenal world is not acceptable . If the concept of " mere facts " appears as well founded in phenomenal experience , outside the phenomenal realm it even seems to have an absolute monopoly . Physical nature is generally believed to be of transphenomenal 1 existence . If we ask the physicists , they deny that requiredness belongs to the notions which they would apply to nature . Chemists need no such concept when they describe substances and their reactions . Some biologists , it is true , have begun to waver . It is hard to discuss certain phases of organic existence without using concepts which imply requiredness . And thus they speculate whether the reason for it is merely an anthropocentric attitude in our observation of organic facts or , rather , some genuine aspect of life itself . In the second case requiredness would occur as a real and as an effective side of organic processes . We are not yet ready for the discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems will have to be solved . All of these refer to the relation in which we find the phenomenal world on the one hand and physical reality on the other ; because on this relation our answer will depend altogether . But is there any such relation ? According to some influential philosophers our program is meaningless . To distinguish between a phenomenal world and a second world have been told that such combinations of Latin and Greek as " transphenomenal " should be carefully avoided . But how many in a million would have the slightest suspicion that here a Latin and a Greek vocable are combined in one word ? May I therefore be allowed to use this most convenient expression ?  | of reality beyond the first is , so they say , sheer epistemological nonsense , however generally this distinction may be accepted . In order to make any statement about the properties of the second world we should have to " transcend , " to leave the first . This , we are assured , is an impossible feat , because whatever observations or statements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consequently there is only one world around us , and we had better refrain from calling it a " phenomenal " world , since by this very term we seem to hint at the existence of transphenomenal entities . If this were correct epistemology , our investigation would necessarily end here . In different forms such views have been brought forward by several exponents of modern Positivism . Since , however , similar opinions have been defended by philosophers , whom otherwise one would hardly call Positivists , I prefer in this connection to use the term " Phenomenalism . " The meaning of this term is , of course , to be clearly distinguished from that of " phenomenology . " Phenomenalism is a definite view of the universe ? the monistic view that it consists exclusively of " phenomena " ? plus certain arguments by which this view is supported . Phenomenology , on the other hand , is a method which we may use whether or not we share the Phenomenalist 's views . As a matter of fact , it will soon become apparent that some results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monistic belief . Though ours is not an epistemological investigation , it seems necessary to discuss the doctrine of Phenomenalism at least fully enough to make it appear somewhat less convincing . Otherwise , what meaning could be found in the statement that requiredness occurs outside the phenomenal world ?  | No matter what our epistemological convictions are , we must recognize besides pure phenomenology all the natural sciences , such as physics , chemistry , geology , biology . Should we believe that the statements of these sciences refer to phenomenal facts , that to do research in physics , for instance , is only another way of dealing with percepts ? This is , in fact , the opinion of not a few philosophers . As an explanation they sometimes add that the physicist is interested in particular sets of phenomena and in the relations found to prevail between these , while he disregards all other phenomena . In general such verdicts are given too quickly to carry full conviction . What , more concretely , is the particular interest that transforms some phenomena into the subjectmatter of physics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world has the power to make certain men , the scientists , altogether indifferent to by far the greater part of the same phenomenal world ? What gives these men the one-sided interest which seems to be the defining characteristic of natural science ? Since according to this opinion no activity can " transcend " the phenomenal world , there must be some dualism in this world itself , which leads to the segregation of the " physical " as a definite part of it . And we can not simply assume that the dualism between the subjective ' and the objective ' side of the phenomenal world is fully responsible for the segregation . The physicist is no more interested in many aspects of phenomenally objective ' events and things than he is in the phenomenology of jealousy or other emotions . He does not study " blue " as a color nor " sweet " as a taste nor " hard " as a quality of touch . Not even problems of visual size and visual shape belong , as such , to his field . How , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | occupied ? If the physicist does not " transcend " the phenomenal world , at least he handles it most strangely ; he seems to ignore by far the greater part of all its contents . The traditional solution of this puzzle is , of course , that only such percepts serve the physicist 's purpose as are trustworthy signs of transphenomenal reality . If this explanation be not accepted , the segregation of physics as a particular science becomes a serious problem . It is the weak point of Phenomenalism that it does not give us a phenomenology of the physicist 's attitude and procedure . From this point of view it should be easy to show how , in concrete examples of research , the physicist always remains occupied with certain phenomena , namely percepts and also perhaps mere constructs . But in the same way it should also be made clear , first , why the physicist is only interested in a restricted number of percepts , and , secondly , what the distinguishing properties of these particular phenomena are . Up to the present time discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much generality . As a general statement it sounds plausible that no science can deal with any but phenomenal material . On nearer inspection , however , it becomes obvious that beyond this general statement the Phenomenalistic interpretation of natural science has a definite task to solve . Far from having been solved , this task does not even seem to be recognized as a serious desideratum . Meanwhile , other people will have a feeling that the general statement is plausible only in so far as it is kept general , and that with increasing concreteness of investigation it may soon lose its apparent self-evidence . The Phenomenalist 's doctrine is monistic in character . He admits only one world . It can not be denied that the defenders of Epistemological Dualism , who speak of two  | worlds , one phenomenal and another transphenomenal , are also open to criticism.2 They will more often point to the shortcomings of their opponents than discuss their own difficulties . Just as the Phenomenalist hesitates to give us , in a purely phenomenal world , a concrete interpretation of the meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow in showing what the actual meaning of " transphenomenal " existence is , and how he or anybody else is able to " transcend " into this second world . On the other hand , the Dualist is able to tell us an impressive story in which Epistemological Dualism is presented not as the theory of many philosophers , but as the direct outcome of research in physics and physiology . In his story , it is true , he uses ? as we shall presently see ? such terms as " objects , " " influence of one object upon another , " " sense organs , " " nerves " and " brain . " For this reason rash thinking might easily tend to the objection that with such terms the Dualist presupposes the existence of a transphenomenal world , that consequently he puts into his story at the very beginning what afterwards he represents as its outcome . This criticism , however , would not be justified . Phenomenalists have to admit that there are such sciences as physics and physiology , also that there are " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between them , " sense organs , " " nerves " and " brains . " Their contention is not that such things are unreal ; rather it is that all of them have to be interpreted as phenomenal en2I need hardly remind the reader that the views of Epistemological Dualism are compatible with the most different metaphysical theories . A Dualist in this sense holds , for instance , that percepts have to be distinguished from ( hidden ) physical entities which correspond to them . Whether these physical facts are ultimately of another essence than percepts ( or phenomena in general ) is a question which this strictly epistemological doctrine leaves entirely open .  | tities . They can not , for such reasons , refuse to listen to the Dualist 's report . As a report , then , the following is common ground for both the Dualist and the Phenomenalist . During the 17th century physicists studied a great many forms of action by which objects influence each other . The objects in question usually belonged to inanimate nature . Nevertheless the leaders of natural science were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence acts upon the human organism , e.g. , upon the sense organs . They could not fail to see that such action is not essentially different from action upon a second inanimate object . When struck by sound waves the eardrum will oscillate in a manner which is quite similar to the reaction of any other sensitive membrane . The human eye is doubtless a more flexible variety of a well known simple apparatus , the camera obscura ; the principle according to which images are projected in the eye is only slightly more complicated . That after physical stimulation of a sense organ messages are carried through nerves to the brain was also a widely accepted notion as early as 1650 . Since then it has become a well established fact of physiology . We know , moreover , that a human being normally has percepts only in so far as those messages arrive in higher centers of the nervous system . At the beginning of this development the scientists tended to conclude merely that certain qualities of phenomenal objects depend on functions of the nervous system , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sensory qualities , " therefore , had to be left aside whenever statements were made about the physical objects . It was harder for them to realize that , consistently applied , the argument leads to more radical consequences . Let us repeat : An object sends out messages which stimu-  | late sense organs . Thereupon other messages begin to travel through nerves toward the brain and , if this brain is functioning normally , a percept emerges . This is a long chain of processes . It is , besides , the only functional connection between the percept and the object from which the train of messages first issued . Have we any right , then , to identify the percept at one end of the chain with the object at the other end ? Whatever degree of similarity there may be between one and the other , they are numerically two different facts . We can not possibly say that what is called the physical object in this story is the same thing as the percept in question . What , then , from the Phenomenalist 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scientist tells us the story , the physical object may , for him , be represented by a percept of his . But could we say that this percept of the scientist is the object which causes the other person 's percept ? With this assumption we should soon find ourselves in difficulties . To the scientist 's percept the same reasoning would apply which he applied to the other person 's percept : the scientist 's percept would be found to be only a remote effect of a corresponding physical object . ( And we should always keep in mind that this statement would have to be acknowledged by a Phenomenalist as well as by a Dualist . ) Consequently we are once more forbidden to identify the percept with a physical object . Again consequently , the scientist 's percept can not be the physical object from which the message causes the other person 's percept . What , then , causes this percept ? ? Or , to illustrate the difficulty from another side : At a time when the other person is well aware of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Supposing that the other person 's percept is an apple , would this apple-percept change or dis-  | appear because the scientist is gone ? Decidedly not . It seems to follow that the scientist be the physical object which causes that apple-percept . What , then , causes this person 's applepercept when he is alone ? Or has this percept a cause only as long as other people are present , whereas it exists without a cause when they are gone ? This situation has meant a difficulty for Phenomenalism ever since there was such a doctrine : In observation , quite apart from any theory , there is a dualism between percepts and their outer causes . And it is hard to interpret these outer causes as though they again were merely percepts . The difficulty would disappear at once , if we could say that the scientist when talking about the physical apple is using his own apple-percept as the representative of something else , namely a physical apple existing independently of perception . The same distinction would then apply quite generally : There would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brains as percepts , and , besides , physical organisms with physical organs as transphenomenal realities . Space as perceived would be something different from space as a physical medium , and time-experience something different from time as an order of transphenomenal events ? simply because in the case of all these notions the same procedure could be applied which we have applied here to an apple . It seems advisable to make it still clearer why the Phenomenalist refuses to accept this explanation . He will admit that percepts are not the only material of physics . But what is added ? According to him : concepts and constructs , as " field of force , " " potential , " " energy , " " entropy , " and so forth . Such notions are not arbitrarily chosen ;  | because in certain phases of the physicist 's procedure they come in contact with percepts , the " observations " of science , and at these points percepts and constructs have to agree . But it would be a meaningless assumption that in this manner we develop more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak of " physical " objects which send stimuli as messages to some entity called the physical organism , and to add the warning that all these things are meant to be " transphenomenal . " Language is patient . But if the content of such statements is analyzed , it proves to be the description of certain thought-processes or thoughtconstructs which obviously belong to the phenomenal world . When something is said to be a " transphenomenal reality " we have before us a mental picture in which , outside one vaguely conceived region , which we call the phenomenal world , there lies a second still vaguer region , to which we give the name " transphenomenal . " It is evident that , here , we only imagine two different phenomenal regions which do not overlap .. To do this is easy enough . However , the possibility of this performance inside the domain of thought does not mean that some miraculous escape has been achieved into a transphenomenal world . Strictly speaking , Dualists are only misusing the fact that the term " trans " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be combined with the term " phenomenal " in general ? whereupon the appearance is created as though this new combination still had a meaning . But no word has a meaning unless we can point to some case in which this meaning is realized . Certainly our visual picture of two regions which do not overlap is no such case for the meaning in question . Here we point to two phenomenal regions , whatever the names given to them . To point to a case in which the term " transphenom-  | enal " could actually assume a meaning is impossible , because we should have to point , first , to phenomenal data ? which is easy ? and , secondly , to something outside this phenomenal world ? which nobody could do , even if his life depended upon it . As a matter of fact , the word " transcendence " should be deleted from our philosophical vocabulary . It will be obvious that in this situation any indirect arguments about the difficulties of Phenomenalism and the advantages of the opposite assumption would only seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuted , it will have to be refuted directly . Therefore , though it may appear as an insoluble task , we shall try to give the term " transcendence " a definite meaning . This purpose , I admit , does seem paradoxical at first , because the only procedure at our disposal is that of phenomenology : How could anything but phenomena be found on this road ? The paradox will disappear , however , if we realize that in speaking of " phenomena " we are easily misled by the same ambiguity which we previously discovered in the term " facts . " When thinking about the phenomenal world we are apt to consider one thing here , another there , and so forth , i.e. , a number of static percepts or other phenomena , each of which seems indifferent to the existence of the others . In such a survey of the phenomenal world , we simply ignore all awareness of definite contexts and relationships . As a matter of fact , it is an altogether common experience that one thing is " referred to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second ; and such phenomena are no less worthy of our attention  | than are the " things " in question . It was this remark which led us to a more adequate understanding of " requiredness . " The same aspect of the phenomenal world will now help us to realize the meaning of " transcendence . " Experienced contexts , it is true , may be contained wholly in the phenomenal world . So far as they are , their occurrence has little to do with our problem . For this reason some arguments which have been brought forward in defence of " transcendence " seem hardly likely to impress the Phenomenalist . If we are told that , in remembering events of our youth , we " transcend " the present and are " referred to " the past , nobody would deny the fact as such . But precisely this fact as such does not seem to imply transcendence beyond the phenomenal world . Just as this world has spatial properties , and just as I may be " referred to " some far distant object , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are often directed toward some event the temporal locus of which lies far back in the past . But , unless more is said about the pfoperties of this experience , I should not really feel convinced by the argument . It may be a remarkable trait of the phenomenal world that it contains a domain which we call the past . But , so the Phenomenalist would say , this domain remains a part of the phenomenal world quite the same . At no point , therefore , is transcendence into transphenomenal reality demonstrated by our example. ? The same seems to be true of a second argument : If with all my force I press against a wall of my room , this wall does not yield in the least , and I am aware not only of my effort but also of a resistance which is stronger than I am . Although in this case I certainly experience a dynamic relationship , I can not admit that ? so far as the description goes ? this relationship extends beyond the phenomenal world . Phenom-  | enalists do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependent upon the self , or as mere phantoms . From their point of view there is no reason why percepts should not be hard and heavy . There is no reason either why , in dynamic contact with them , we should always feel superior . If it is true , therefore , that in this experience I am once more " referred to " something outside myself , it is still no less obvious that the object outside , with all its independence and resistance , remains in the phenomenal world precisely as I do . From these unsatisfactory examples , however , we can deduce a scheme of what would be a more convincing demonstration of transcendence . One thing may be referred to another in a great many different ways . As a simple case I shall choose a relation of size : one thing is seen to be larger than another some distance away from the first . It seems obvious here that in the reference , which extends from the first to the second , the existence of this second thing is " implied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this extent a meaning beyond itself . One might add that , when the first thing is given , the reference contains an indication of the nature of the second , in our example , an indication of its size . It would not be difficult to show that the same applies to most forms of reference . If the second thing or " term " itself belongs to the phenomenal world , its presence and nature as part of the context in question validate the implication . But what about the reference and its implication , if the second term is not experienced as a concrete part of the phenomenal world , if , instead , it belongs to transphenomenal reality ? Both the reference and the implication could remain the same so long as certain conditions were fulfilled . These are the conditions : First , we  | should have to assume that the phenomenal world and transphenomenal reality belong to one common realm of existence , in which transition is possible from one domain to the other . The second condition is that " reference " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a common functional trait of both phenomenal and transphenomenal existence , more particularly : that a reference may extend from a phenomenal term on the one hand to a transphenomenal term on the other . So far this is mere logical analysis of a possibility . Whether its outcome has any value depends altogether on phenomenological observation . Before such observation is undertaken , however , we should know what we may expect to find , if the possibility corresponds with facts . This expectation is easily formulated : There should be cases in which a thing or , perhaps , the self is felt to be referred to some definite entity although at the same time this " second term " is not given inside the phenomenal world . The reference as such would imply that beyond there is such an entity ; it would be felt directly as extending to a second term outside . Moreover , the fact that the reference is of a particular kind might even imply something about the nature , the status of the entity in question . In other words , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give a reasonable meaning to the concept of transcendence : We might find that sometimes concrete reference is a bridge which rests on phenomenal ground on our side , and is still felt , from our side , to have a corresponding support elsewhere , although this second support is not visible from where we are . Such a second support would be a part of transphenomenal reality . It will be sufficient for our purpose , if we discover one  | single example in which transcendence is , in this way , an actual experience . We wish to demonstrate simply that , as a matter of principle , such an experience does occur , not that it is more or less frequent . One concrete example would probably show us not only transcendence as a fact , but also how it is realized despite all arguments to the contrary . Moreover , the demonstration of any case of transcendence would be a demonstration of transphenomenal reality at the same time . This is all we wish to achieve at this point . May I return to questions of memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's past life when this event is actually given as an image . In this case , as I pointed out above , the reference extends from one 's present self to something temporally distant . Nevertheless , it does not seem to transcend phenomenal data . But how about this other situation ? I wish to remember the new painter 's name which I heard yesterday during a conversation . " Just a moment , " I say to myself , " I know that I know it ; I shall get it at once . " Everybody has such experiences . Before a name or another fact is actually remembered there may be a difficulty , a suspense , a delay in its appearance . Nevertheless we may know at the same time that " it is there " ; we feel referred , and even referred to the right thing , even though this same thing has not yet emerged into phenomenal existence . Precisely as expected , the reference extends into " darkness " beyond ; and yet we feel , from our side , how , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description is not quite complete , however . In how far is the thing beyond felt to be the right thing ? Whenever we try to remember in spite of temporary difficulties , some data are given phenomenally which the thing beyond  | has to fit . It belongs to a phenomenal context in which its place is still left open . We are directed toward this context and , thus , we feel how the phenomenal part of the context bears definite reference to the missing part outside . It is not reference in general which in such cases implies some transphenomenal entity ; it is , rather , a particular reference which extends beyond , and its implication is that the thing outside fits the concrete phenomenal context in question . It would not be a serious objection , of course , if we were told that the wish to remember is not always accompanied by the feeling that we can do it . It should be unnecessary to repeat that we are not concerned here with questions of frequency or of regular occurrence , but rather with occurrence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite our feeling that " it is there " we should actually fail to recall the name afterwards . Lack of sufficient interest or any disturbance might easily prevent this achievement . Would our phenomenological observation of transcendence be thereby refuted ? By no means . We are not maintaining that as a matter of fact certain events will follow transcendence as an experience , but that there is transcendence , and that , while it lasts , it implies transphenomenal existence . On the other hand , just this objection is apt to call our attention to a further aspect of our example . Our experience of reference to an entity beyond is so definite that we are often clearly aware of fluctuations in the status of this entity . The delay of recall may be prolonged . In this case the situation does not usually remain stationary . " I almost got it , " we say then , or " too bad , now it has slipped farther off again , " and so on . In the phenomenal field there is the  | incomplete context , beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we experience vividly , sometimes almost painfully , how it comes nearer for one moment , recedes again , approaches once more , though still outside , and perhaps eventually emerges into phenomenal existence . Here the Phenomenalist might object that , according to this description , the approach and the receding seem to be phenomenal experiences . He would be right . They are phenomena . But they are phenomena of reference or , rather , of change of reference , in which it is directly implied that " beyond there " is some entity , the right thing , the status of which varies as the changes of reference indicate . Consequently , transcending reference has two different aspects in our example . On the one hand , it is implied in the reference that the entity outside fits the given , but incomplete phenomenal context , that it is the right thing . On the other hand , the reference varies in a manner which , for the thing outside , implies changes of functional distance , of approach to or receding from the phenomenal domain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James once described the same situation : " Suppose we try to recall a forgotten name . The state of our consciousness is peculiar . There is a gap therein ; but no mere gap . It is a gap that is intensely active . A sort of wraith of the name is in it , beckoning us in a given direction , making us at moments tingle with the sense of our closeness , and then letting us sink back without the longedfor term . If wrong names are proposed to us , this singularly definite gap acts immediately so as to negate them . They do not fit into its mould . " 3 3 The Principles of Psychology ( 1886 ) , I , p. 251.  | As a defence the Phenomenalist will perhaps maintain that even before actual recall the entity in question is not altogether outside the phenomenal world . At least a vague shadow or a dim spot might be present as a representative of the second term to which the incomplete phenomenal context is felt to be referred . It would be a fruitless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument has a factual basis . Fortunately , however , the argument would not be valid even if there were always such a shadow or a dim spot . The incomplete phenomenal context is felt to be referred not to a shadow or a spot as such , but to " the right thing beyond , " i.e. , to a much more particular and definite entity , the particular properties of which are at the time not yet realized phenomenally . In the reference to this entity it is implied that it is precisely the thing we are looking for . A mere shadow would not be felt to fit the given particular context . Thus , the presence or absence of such vague phenomena becomes irrelevant to our discussion . In addition to this a second objection will probably be raised . After all , one might say , instead of demonstrating transcendence you are merely drawing an inference by analogy . It is a regular experience that in a case of reference there are two phenomenal terms of which one is referred to the other . In your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it , a feeling of reference . From this you conclude that even this case should follow the general rule , and that , consequently , there must be a second term somewhere. ? As a matter of fact , this interpretation does not correspond with the actual characteristics of our example . It is not true that , besides an incomplete phenomenal context , I have only a feeling of mere reference plus a conviction about a rule . Whenever I am sure I " have the right thing , " the present and individual reference is directly felt to lead to an individual second term in the particular case . So much is implied in my concrete awareness of the present reference . Moreover , the argument ignores the fact that during the delay of recall we often feel distinctly how that definite thing outside changes its readiness for actual recall from one moment to the other . I do not see any connection between such facts  | and the proposed interpretation by analogy . We have no right to deprive the phenomenological nature of a situation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left which will yield to trivial explanations . In another connection it will be shown that , beyond the general problem of transcendence , our example has some relevance for the main question of this investigation , i.e. , the problem of requiredness . As to transcendence in general , the present case is by no means the only paradigm available . In the field of memory alone we could easily add a few more which might be used in a systematic demonstration of transcendence ; and I have little doubt that others could be found in perception . Since , however , it is not our aim to treat this problem generally , I shall refrain from describing other such examples . Nor are they needed . They could teach us little more than we have just been able to learn . One fact of transcendence ought to suffice to make us acquainted with transcendence as a type of experience . Knowledge of its occurrence seems to imply knowledge of its nature . This gives our demonstration sufficient generality for all our purposes . I do not hesitate to conclude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning , that the same is true of " transphenomenal reality , " and that , in principle , we may ascribe existence to transphenomenal entities no less than to percepts and other phenomena . Consequently , it is a genuine problem whether or not requiredness occurs among the properties of transphenomenal reality . Practically all research in natural science proceeds , I believe , on the tacit assumption that its subject-matter exists outside the phenomenal worlds of all observers . As we have seen , such a hypothesis is not meaningless in principle . On the other hand the scientist cares little for  | the phenomenological foundations of this assumption . And when he tries to find the properties and laws of transphenomenal entities he does not start with such cases as give direct evidence of transphenomenal existence . Indeed , of these he usually knows little or nothing . His is a more naive and a more indirect procedure . It also has a wider scope . His tendency is to jump over all epistemological difficulties and to trust his observations and his inferences to provide genuine knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is actually done and how the scientist 's method or his results compare with direct evidence of transphenomenal existence . Knowing , however , that there is such evidence , we shall from now on assume that it is evidence of facts which lie within the general realm of physical nature ? the same nature with which the scientist is occupied . As to the scientist 's work we shall suppose that , in spite of the present revolution in physics , many properties and laws of transphenomenal nature are definitely known , however such knowledge may have been obtained . I am willing to trust the methods of natural science to this extent , and to surmise that those particular transphenomenal entities of whose existence we have direct transcending evidence will also sooner or later become objects of such scientific investigation . Scientific research is directed toward inanimate objects and their behavior , but also toward organisms and the totality of those processes which we call life . ( All these terms , I repeat , are now supposed to refer to transphenomenal reality . ) Where in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we find it implied in our experience of direct transcendence ? So far as our example goes ? which was a case of imminent recall ? we  | can have little doubt about the locus in question . The distinctive trait of transcendence as we observed it , was direct coherence of function , of reference , between an incomplete phenomenal context and a transphenomenal entity . There is only one part of nature which , according to present knowledge , could in this case be so intimately in contact with phenomenal data . This part of nature is the circumscribed world of brain-events . Our conclusion will therefore be that , in trying to remember something and knowing that we know it , our reference is from the point of view of science reference to a definite neurological , or better : neural entity , an entity which would commonly and perhaps clumsily be called a memory-trace . I wonder whether , beyond our special example , any direct transcendence whatever refers , in this sense , to other than neural realities , though of course these may not always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid a misunderstanding I should perhaps add that transcendence , as we experience it in our example , does not indicate of course in what kind of transphenomenal world the second term beyond ' is located . Nor is there in this experience of transcendence any awareness of a nervous system as a nervous system . What I wish to say is merely this : A demonstration of transcendence as such tends to justify in principle what the physicists and other scientists are doing when they ascribe transphenomenal existence to those objects with which they are occupied . Without trying here to legitimate all their particular assumptions we shall from now on treat the main outlines of their construction as accurate knowledge . Thus we shall speak of physical systems , of organisms , of nervous systems , and so forth , as transphenomenal entities . We shall , however , do more . We shall turn around , look back  | upon our example of transcendence and try to give the the term beyond ' ? which phenomenally was no more than the right thing , still hidden , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those constructs of science . If we find that this place is in the nervous system , and that , physiologically speaking , it must be a memory-trace , we are going of course far beyond the content of our phenomenological description of transcendence . It would probably betray exaggerated optimism , if we should believe that after our argument in favor of transcendence the philosophical reader will feel entirely at ease . One difficulty at least has not yet been discussed explicitly . It is our next task to state and then to solve this further problem . For this purpose we shall make ourselves acquainted with one more school of philosophy . In its attack on Epistemological Dualism , Phenomenalism has found an ally in New Realism . According to New Realism a dualistic epistemology leads to an unnatural and suspiciously complicated picture of the world . Any unsophisticated person , the New Realist would say , has one world around him . This colorful world of everyday experience exhibits all the objectivity and permanency which the exponents of Epistemological Dualism ascribe to a hidden physical world . Dualistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percepts to a merely temporal and subjective affair , and thus contradict common sense which finds itself in immediate contact with objective reality . New Realism takes sides with common sense . The world as we have it directly before us is , according to this doctrine , the physical world na less than it is the world per-  | ceived . It should be possible , therefore , to find another explanation for those facts because of which the Dualists separate percepts from real objects . If we could be Realists in a more naive way there would be no need for constructing a foreign world beyond . It is obvious that New Realism , though by no means identical with Phenomenalism proper , has at least some points in common with this view . " Can we transcend the phenomenal world ? " ? " A meaningless question , " answers the Phenomenalist . " Why , " asks the New Realist , " should I attempt anything so unpleasant ? " In a powerful book , 4 Professor Lovejoy has thoroughly examined the different forms in which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been developed . They all try to show how , in our thinking about physical objects and about percepts , partial or total coincidence of both can be obtained without a contradiction . Professor Lovejoy , however , is led to the conclusion that , if we develop such theories consistently , all of them give a picture of the world which is incomparably more complicated and even more startling than the picture given by Epistemological Dualism . An unsophisticated witness would be much more astonished by the results of Epistemological Monism than he could possibly be by the other view . I find great force in Lovejoy 's arguments , and I accept his statement : " That this goal ? of New Realism ? has not been and can not be attained is one of the clearest results of the philosophical discussion of the past twentyfive years . " 5 To a certain extent , a demonstration of transcendence means an argument against New Realism no less than 4 The Revolt against Dualism ( 1984 5lbid. , p . W.  | against Phenomenalism . To the same extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a critical discussion of New Realism . Yet the case in question belongs to the field of remembering ; and the main issue between New Realism and Epistemological Dualism is the interpretation of percepts . In this field it is the apparent independence , the objectivity and the external location of thing-percepts which makes it difficult for many to admit that such things are no more than percepts , not the real and independent physical things at the same time . A fully satisfactory answer to the New Realist 's claims will only be given if such characteristics of percepts are clearly explained by Epistemological Dualism . I am not convinced that this has been done even by Lovejoy . Among these characteristics , external location of percepts is by far the most impressive . Epistemological Dualism insists on the genetic or functional subjectivity of percepts , on the fact that all percepts depend on processes inside the organism . As the physiologist would put it : " An object sends out messages which stimulate sense organs . Thereupon other messages begin to travel through nerves towards the brain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerges . " 6 It seems to contradict this view that , allegedly founded on processes in my interior , such percepts as tree , house , cloud , moon and thousands of others are clearly localized outside of me . When we survey the history of philosophy and scientific thought during the past century we find that some of the ablest minds are given to serious speculation about this paradox . Both E. H. Weber and H. von Helmholtz whose work contributed so much to the foundation of psychology as a science tried to find an explanation . Philosophers 6 See above , this chapter , p. 109 f.  | from Schopenhauer to Whitehead seem to have been convinced that the genuine , the original , location of percepts must indeed be somewhere in our interior . That we do find them not there , but outside , may easily have been the strongest psychological motive in the origin of New Realism . Only a very few authors , mostly men of great phenomenological power , have been able to recognize the apparent puzzle as what it really is : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men were E. Hering , the physiologist , and E. Mach , the physicist and philosopher . ' It will help us to explain Epistemological Dualism , if we show that external location of percepts does not even contain a problem , much less a paradox . I have tried to do the same before , 8 but not simply enough and therefore not successfully . Another attempt seems required for two reasons . Quite apart from the present investigation it is almost an embarrassing fact that even great philosophers should still be influenced by a mere pseudoproblem . Besides , I wish to free this present investigation from any shadow which so deplorable a misunderstanding might throw on Epistemological Dualism . At least since Schopenhauer one explanation has generally been given which is entirely unacceptable because it adopts the faulty premises of the pseudoproblem . According to this theory percepts would really be localized in our interior , if the mind , conscious or unconscious , were not so much given to causal thinking . All these sensory experiences , the mind seems to say , must come from somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 7 Cf. also W. James , The Principles of Psychology ( 1896 ) , II , pp. 31 if . 8 Cf. Gestalt Psychology ( 1929 ) , pp. 224-283. -A more thorough treatment of the same question may be found in my article , Ein altes Scheinproblem , in Die Naturwissenschaften , 17 ( 1929 ) .  | can trace them back to their several origins in space , and if I can then assign to them such outer locations. ? Other authors would give a similar explanation in less intellectualistic terms . So far , however , as they feel that location of percepts inside ourselves should be expected , and that therefore external location must be explained , their theories are practically equivalent to Schopenhauer 's amazing assumption of mental projection . We shall now give the interpretation which follows from the point of view of Epistemological Dualism . In doing it we shall make use , of course , of all the notions which are characteristic of this doctrine . Consequently we shall speak of phenomena on the one hand , of transphenomenal realities on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambiguities which arise from the fact that even in philosophical language many words are used in two meanings , one phenomenal and the other transphenomenal . If we give sufficient attention to this circumstance , the apparent paradox will evaporate . 1 . If we say that percepts depend on processes inside the organism , what does the word " organism " mean in this connection ? Evidently the physical object the properties of which are investigated by anatomists , by physiologists and by neurologists. ? Is this physical object a percept ? No , according to Epistemological Dualism it is , like all physical objects , a transphenomenal entity ; correspondingly the processes in question are transphenomenal events . It is not an argument against these statements that , in the investigation of the organism and its functions , the anatomist , the physiologist and neurologist rely on percepts . Precisely as the physicist investigates transphenomenal entities and still uses certain percepts as his primary material , so his colleagues in biology study transphenomenal facts  | although the primary material of their observations consists of percepts . Unfortunately we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transphenomenal entity and to the body as a percept , just as a piece of silver is called silver , whether we think of the physical object or of the corresponding percept . From this paragraph it follows that when thing-percepts and other phenomena are said to be genetically subjective , to depend upon processes inside the organism , the term " inside " refers to a physical , a transphenomenal fact . 2 . If I say that thing-percepts are located outside myself , what does the word ' myself ' mean ? Obviously something of which I am aware in the bright daylight of direct phenomenal experience . This commonplace ' self ' is the thing to which we refer in such statements as " I stumbled , " " I was sitting on a chair , " " I could not walk any faster . " When we use such expressions in everyday life we do not think of transphenomenal entities ; nor do we refer to our own personality , our self in a more refined sense of the term . Rather , we mean a definite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organism as a transphenomenal entity we shall from now on call the percept ' body ' and reserve the term organism for the corresponding transphenomenal entity . That in this sense the ' body ' is a percept can hardly be denied . Just as I see , hear and feel other things which I call my percepts , ? so the thing which from now on we shall call my ' body ' is to some extent given in my visual field , may be heard and may also be felt . Among other percepts it occurs as one more percept ? to be sure , one of particular interest . It does not matter in our present discussion that the sensory data which constitute ' my body ' are of a more varied nature than those which constitute most other percepts.  | From this paragraph it follows that , when thingpercepts are said to be located outside myself , ' the term outside ' must refer to a strictly phenomenal fact : In phenomenal space thing-percepts are as a rule localized ' outside ' one more percept which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paragraphs taken together that , if thing-percepts depend upon processes " inside " and still are localized outside , ' the term " inside " and the term outside ' refer here to different entities , the organism and the body . ' They also refer to different spaces , the first to physical space and the second to phenomenal space . Consequently the two statements do not contradict each other . In case this is not yet obvious I shall repeat the argument in other words . According to Epistemological Dualism all individual percepts , those which we call things as well as the percept ' my body , ' depend on transphenomenal events in a transphenomenal entity , the organism . Even the fact of such dependence , however , is in a simple perceptual situation not a matter of phenomenal awareness ; only some indirect procedures and conclusions of physicists , physiologists and philosophers lead to the conviction that there is such a dependence . On the other hand , all those percepts appear in a general phenomenal medium , phenomenal space , and as a rule they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' for instance , near the house , ' the cloud ' and the moon ' above ? and myself ' rather far from these things , although ' my feet ' are in touch with the percept ground . ' It is certainly no more surprising that the other percepts appear outside the percept my body , ' than that the moon , ' the cloud ' and the tree ' appear outside the percept house . ' Conversely , instead of expecting to find the tree , ' the house , ' the cloud ' and the moon ' inside myself , ' I might quite as well expect to see myself '  | inside one of the thing-percepts tree , ' cloud ' or moon ' . ' Without exception we are dealing here with percepts which have a definite phenomenal location relative to each other , and there is no reason whatsoever why in phenomenal space the percept myself ( my body ' ) should not in principle play the same role as that played by other percepts . Thus , astonishing though it may appear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed no real problem at all . This becomes obvious as soon as we distinguish between the organism as a transphenomenal entity and the body ' as a percept . To the first refers the statement that all percepts depend on processes inside the organism ? where even the word depend , just as inside and organism , has a transphenomenal meaning . To the second , the ' body ' - percept , refers the sentence that things have places outside myself ' ? where all words point to phenomenal facts and outside ' is a phenomenal relation in phenomenal space . Only if we fail to see that one statement is about relations in transphenomenal space ( including the organism ) , while the other is about phenomenal relations in phenomenal space ( including the bodily self ' ) ? only so long can we believe that these statements contradict each other . Confuse the organism with the ' self ' - percept , fail to distinguish between physical space and phenomenal space , and you have the great paradox : " Inside " predicated there contradicts ' outside ' found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappears without the help of any special hypothesis . It simply vanishes before consistent thinking on the accepted premises of Epistemological Dualism . The argument as given does not strictly speaking need supplementation . For the sake of completeness , however ,  | and in preparation for further discussions we shall take one more step which will bring us in touch with science , namely , with neurology . From the last paragraphs one is naturally led to two questions : Why should percepts be so nicely distributed in phenomenal space ? And , how more concretely do phenomena depend on processes inside the organism ? It will be obvious that these questions belong together . They express the need for more insight into the relation which prevails between percepts in phenomenal space on the one hand and neural events inside the organism on the other . In trying to give a preliminary answer , we had better simplify the situation . The field of percepts usually contains data of many sense-modalities : visual , auditory , tactual , olfactory , kinaesthetic and so on . There is but one phenomenal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this space is , as a rule , one common order for all of them , so that , for instance , I hear a car starting where I also see it . Why that should be so is still a matter of controversy with which I do not wish to burden this discussion . For this reason the following account will be restricted to data of one sensory modality only , namely , that of visual percepts . Our problem therefore is : How is the spatial distribution of visual percepts connected with their dependence on transphenomenal events in the organism ? Without trespassing on hypothetical ground we can give the following preliminary answer . On the retina of the eye , images of physical objects are projected in an orderly manner . The distribution of images is similar to that of photographic images on the sensitive film in a camera . In consequence of such stimulation , nerveimpulses from various points on the retina begin to travel along the fibers of the optic nerve and then along more  | central neurons . Eventually they arrive in a definite part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there cause further processes which seem to be the final phase of purely visual function . According to present knowledge visual experience of human beings depends on these processes . The most important point , however , is that the impulses on their way to the cortex and the final processes in the cortex are no less well distributed than is stimulation on the retina . At the present time evidence is overwhelming for this fact both in human pathology and in experimentation on infrahuman mammals . Whatever the reason may be , impulses arrive and processes develop in the striate area of the cortex as an orderly pattern . Moreover , the spatial properties of this pattern are to some degree akin to those which the pattern of images exhibits on the retina . This statement will acquire a more definite meaning if we add a few anatomical data . The brain , as everybody knows , has two hemispheres which are to some degree separated by the median fissure , but are at the same time connected by several structures , first of all by the fibres of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striate area . In the case of the human brain these areas are located on the dorsal side of the brain where the cortex of both hemispheres bends and disappears into the median fissure . Here the two striate areas face each other across this fissure . Only small portions of the areas remain ? on the outer surface of the hemispheres , covering their posterior poles . Anatomically the extension of the visual cortex is well defined by a histological peculiarity . Wherever this part of the cortex is cut vertically to its own surface a white stripe appears  | in the otherwise grey tissue . It is this white stripe which has given the visual cortex the name of " striate area . " Let us suppose now that only one eye of a person is functioning . On the retina of this eye images of outer physical objects will be projected , and presently nerve impulses will begin to travel along the optic fibers . As I said before , at their arrival in the cortex their spatial distribution will correspond to a certain extent with the pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started from the left half of the retina arrive in the striate area of the left hemisphere , while those which come from the right half of the retina take their course to the right striate area . Under normal circumstances both eyes function . The images of objects are then projected upon the retinae of both eyes . For the second eye , however , the same rule holds : impulses from its left side arrive in the left striate area , impulses from the right half in the right striate area . For simple reasons of retinal projection such processes of the two eyes as correspond to the same objects in physical space outside are conducted in this manner to approximately the same parts of the visual cortex . A physical object to one 's left will be projected on the right side of both retinae , and so forth . Since the impulses which correspond to the two images of the object arrive at approximately the same region of the visual cortex they may perhaps arouse one single cortical process there . Certain facts seem to indicate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach the limits of actual knowledge . On the other hand , it is definitely known that between the distribution of processes in the visual cortex and the distribution of images on the retinae there is correspondence not only as to halves , but also as  | to smaller parts . In this sense neurologists are doubtless right when- they say that the visual cortex , i.e. , the two striate areas taken together , represents a " cortical retina . " May I offer a concrete example . ( As has been done consistently in the last three paragraphs all terms will be used in a physical or transphenomenal sense ) . A man sits at his desk on which there are a pencil and a ruler , several inches apart . With a given direction of his . eyes an image of the pencil will be projected on certain parts of both retinae and an image of the ruler on other parts . Between these images the surface of the table will be projected as it will also be around these images . From what we know about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it follows immediately that in the striate- areas there will be two separate processes in different places , one corresponding to the pencil and the other to the ruler.9 Between these processes and around them there will be other processes which correspond to the surface of the table . In this statement there is , I insist , no speculation whatsoever . It simply expresses , for a particular example , what is definitely known as a general rule . And it follows that , to a certain extent , the spatial relations not only of retinal images but also of the corresponding physical objects themselves are , in the visual cortex , represented by analogous spatial relations . The physical situation , however , will usually contain more components than those which have as yet been men9 In order to simplify matters I am here omitting the fact that of each object there are in our case two images , one in each eye , which might , when corresponding impulses arrive in the cortex , produce two processes for each object . Those who feel disturbed by this situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approximately the same place will become fused ; or else , they may consider the case where only one eye is open . This case is quite sufficient for a demonstration of what we want to prove .  | tioned . Let us assume that in our example the man has put his hands on the edge of the desk . So far as reflection of daylight from their surfaces is concerned these hands are physical objects just as are the pencil and the ruler . Consequently , if the hands are in a natural position before the rest of the organism and before the eyes , images of his own hands will be projected on the retinae of the man . Supposing that on the desk the positions of the hands are different from those of the pencil and the ruler , these retinal images of the hands will have different locations from those of the two things . Since all these images do not differ from each other in principle , nerve impulses will start where the images of the hands are projected precisely as other impulses issue from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the visual cortex of the man there will presently be processes which represent his hands , and these processes will have locations of their own , different from those where the pencil and the ruler are represented by their processes . Now , as a rule , the hands will not be the only parts of the organism which in this manner stimulate the eyes of the same organism so that eventually corresponding processes occur in the visual cortex . Rather the retinal images of the hands will be parts of more extended images in which projection of the forearms and perhaps , more peripherally , even the trunk and some portion of the legs may be included . Since retinal projection preserves to some degree the spatial order in which , outside the eye , the objects are distributed ; since , furthermore , a similar relation holds between the retinal projection and the distribution of cortical processes , the neurological situation is simple enough : In their totality the processes of the visual cortex may be considered as a picture of the fact that here an organism is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects have certain spatial relations relative to each other and relative to the organism . At least in so far as the objects and the organism are outside each other there is agreement between their distribution in physical space at large and the distribution of corresponding events in the narrower physical world of the brain . For , in some part of the visual cortex the visible surface of the organism is represented , and in other parts of the same area we have those processes which represent the objects outside the organism . Between the cortical representation of the visible organism and that of other objects there is of course no gap . If the hands , for instance , lie on the edge of the desk , the retinal image of the desk will extend between the images of the hands and those of the pencil and the ruler . The same will apply to the processes which , in the visual cortex , represent the hands or other parts of the organism , the surface of the desk and those objects . Still , all these parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " cortical retina " no less than as objects . There is no essential change in this respect , if the eyes turn to a new point of fixation , or if the organism moves as a whole . In both cases retinal images both of other objects and of the organism will generally change their locations , some images will disappear and others will take their places . The same will be true of corresponding cortical processes . But since all the physical objects remain outside the physical organism , their retinal images will always remain outside the image of the organism ; and corresponding cortical processes will remain outside the process by which the surface of the organism itself is represented . Not all philosophers are well acquainted with this part of neurology . I repeat , therefore , that my description does not in any essential point contain mere assumptions , al-  | though it ignores several problems with which at present we are not yet concerned . Among the transphenomenal entities which have been mentioned in these paragraphs the processes in the visual cortex are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So far as we know , on these processes visual percepts depend most directly . If a circumscribed but not too small part of the striate areas is destroyed , no visual perception is possible of such things as would otherwise be represented by processes in that region . Any essential disturbance of the " cortical retina , " by pathological factors or by wounds , leads to alteration of the phenomenal visual field . It seems safe to conclude that normal vision is based on normal function of the same cortical region , more concretely , that particular visual percepts as they appear in the visual field depend directly on particular corresponding processes in the visual cortex . Such terms as " depend on " and " based on " should , of course , be used with caution . They are meant to express the fact that certain things , the visual percepts , exist , disappear or change in , correlation with the occurrence , the disappearance or the alteration of corresponding brain-events . A relation of this kind may still be interpreted in several ways . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between such different possibilities . We come back to questions of localization . Part of the organism itself , we have found , and physical objects before it are represented in the visual cortex by processes the distribution of which corresponds roughly with the fact that those other objects have locations outside the organism . If , now , on all such processes visual percepts are based , is there any neurological reason why phenomenally the thingpercepts should be localized inside the body-percept ? In  | the visual cortex the processes on which the thing-percepts depend are certainly external to those on which the visual body-percept is based . Whatever else this may mean , the unfortunate expectation that things ' should appear in the interior of the body ' can not possibly be derived from the neurological situation . On the contrary , so far as distribution of underlying processes is concerned , precisely the opposite , localization of visual things outside the visual body , might seem to be more plausible . And it is this spatial relation which we find realized in visual experience when we say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and the moon ' appear at different distances outside ourselves . ' Sometimes one hears the objection that after all the visual cortex , as the brain in general , is situated inside the skull ; and that to this extent all the processes of the visual cortex remain interior . Thus one might expect the visual field as a whole to have an interior location . In this argument a certain fact is correctly stated , but the conclusion does not follow . Granting for a moment that mere geometrical relationships in the cortex are really essential for spatial relationships in phenomenal experience , we should at once have to add that this would apply to neural events on which visual percepts or other phenomena are based , not to anatomical structures in which such processes will never occur . So far as brain-events and visual percepts are concerned , the presence of the skull has no direct relevance . The fact that the skull surrounds the brain could show in the visual field only if in bones there were processes on which percepts would depend . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such percepts . But there are no such processes in the skull . Why then should the visual field appear as locked up in something else ? Though our immediate task is hereby solved , a few remarks will be needed lest our representation of neurological facts be seriously misunderstood .  | A most important point is this . The distribution of processes in the visual cortex certainly gives no support to the idea that thing-percepts should have an interior location . So much is true . On the other hand , it would be a serious mistake if we were to make the positive assumption that the distribution of different processes in different parts of the visual cortex yields , as such , a full understanding of actual relationships in phenomenal space . This warning applies generally , not only to the spatial relations between thing-percepts and the body , but also to those between two or more thing-percepts . Apart from the fact that phenomenal space is three-dimensional , while our discussion has referred to a two-dimensional pattern of brain-events , phenomenal space has numerous traits which mere geometrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To give one simple example only : visual space has to some degree metrical properties . In a given case it has a sense to say on mere inspection that the distance between two things in the visual field appears equal to the distance between two other things of the field . If , now , we should suppose that in the visual cortex the same equality holds for the two distances by which the pairs of corresponding processes are separated , our assumption might be often wrong , and it would surely be wrong in certain cases . Visual distances are not metrically proportional to geometrical distances in brain-space . On the other hand , as to topological relations of mere distance and mutual exclusion in general , there is good agreement between percepts in the visual field and corresponding cortical processes . In our present discussion this is the only relevant fact . To summarize : Epistemological Dualism holds that percepts can not be identified with physical objects , because  | percepts emerge only after many events have happened between the objects and the organism , in peripheral parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view seems to lead to a paradox since , as a rule , thing-percepts appear outside our body . We have first shown that this argument is due to an ambiguity of terms . Then , in a discussion of neurological data , we have found that on this ground localization of thing-percepts inside ourselves ' could never be expected . Much discussion between the New Realists and their opponents would probably have been avoided if more attention had been given to these sections of psychology and neurology . In this chapter it has been explained in what sense we use such terms as nature and physical world . It will be our next task to compare nature with the phenomenal world .  | IF requiredness occurred in nature , the phenomenal world and transphenomenal reality would have one essential trait in common . According to a widely accepted belief this is impossible since , so we are told , both the material and the laws of nature are incomparable with the contents and the laws of immediate experience . As a matter of principle there can not be any traits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sides of the world . Is this true ? No , it is absolutely impossible , provided that the physical world is transphenomenal , and that we are nevertheless able to discover some of its secrets . Let us first consider nature in general and postpone the special discussion of living systems . Man has no direct access to the physical world . The phenomenal world contains all the material which is directly given to him . Thus , our approach to the physical domain will under all circumstances consist of inferences which we draw from the observation of certain percepts or , perhaps , also from other experiences ; it will always be a procedure of construction . For this construction no building material is available but what we find in the phenomenal world . In this sense , then , it does not only become possible that in some respects nature has traits in common with phenomenal material . Rather there can not be a single trait in  | nature which has not at least one model somewhere in the phenomenal world . This refers to nature so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How , in fact , could the process of construction give us any special or general result which was toto genere different from all experiences that men have ever had ? Standing before the physicist 's building we could and should always point to this stone or that principle of structure and should ask : Where did you get that ? Besides , what is it ? And the physicist would always have to point to some phenomenon as his source ; sometimes , though the item might look like one thing in his building , he would even have to point to several phenomenal data in turn as being the various ingredients of one of his concepts . ' For a moment it might appear as though in the last chapter an argument had been given which would invalidate this conclusion . There I tried to show that " transcendence " is a definite experience , and that to that extent we are at times in direct contact with transphenomenal reality . However , such contact remains limited enough , limited to those implications which are inherent in a reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term outside . In the experience of transcendence this second term as such does not become accessible , may its existence be ever so forcibly implied in the reference . As to its properties outside , they are again only given by implication . And I do not know of any case in which transcending reference would , for the entity outside , imply otherwise unknown properties . The implication is always 1 A short time ago K. Lewin made the statement that the objects of physics are experienced " no less directly than those of psychology . " ( Principles of Topological Psychology , 1936 , p. 20 . ) I hope that Professor Lewin will find an opportunity to explain by what argument he supports this opinion .  | such that an understandable relationship extends from the phenomenal term inside to the hidden term outside ; which means that the entity outside is , in the relevant respect , comparable in principle with the phenomenon inside . In this way , therefore , we can not escape the conclusion that the building of physics consists of such concepts as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the other hand , transcendence as I know it seems to show that , besides being the only material available , concepts shaped after phenomenal models may also be a most appropriate material . This follows from the fact that in transcending reference transphenomenal entities are implied with such properties as compare intelligibly with phenomena in each case . I do not expect to find any examples of which this could not be said . So far as we know transcendence , it seems to show directly that transphenomenal reality is akin to phenomenal experience . The physicist 's problem would then be what concepts of phenomenal origin in general he should use in his construction , and what special concepts would fit best in each particular case . In his choice he is directed by observational data on the one hand and by the need for systematic consistency and clearness on the other . Though all the material which the physicist uses in his construction is ultimately derived from phenomenal sources , his procedure may of course result in a building which , to superficial inspection , has very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general model of phenomenal things he can construct transphenomenal objects the properties of which differ widely from those of the model . Thus , many traits of phenomenal things may be strictly excluded in the construction of transphenomenal objects . The same may happen with relations which  | we find between things in the phenomenal world , but do not admit in the system of physics . It is a truism that elimination of phenomenal characteristics from this system has really marked the progress of science during the last 30o years . Urges as felt by man were once freely attributed to physical entities in action ; so-called tertiary qualities played an essential role in early physics ; common sensory qualities still belonged to Aristotelian physics when Galileo was young . They have all disappeared from the present system . From this fact alone it follows that nobody who becomes acquainted with the physicist 's building will find , at first , much resemblance with his familiar phenomenal home . Its foreign appearance is , however , further enhanced by the high degree of elaboration which accepted phenomenal data undergo before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concepts of physics are complicated products of thinking in which materials from many places in phenomenal experience are united , so that at present it is extremely hard to say where in the phenomenal world their various sources lie . Most of all is this true of many notions which the physicist tends to identify with their mathematical expressions . Apparently nobody knows exactly how many different materials from how many different parts of the phenomenal world contribute to one such apparently simple concept as , say , " potential energy . " Clearness and familiarity of the mathematical symbol determine , for the expert , exactly how he has to use it . It leads to accurate operations . But this does not mean that the expert can give us its legitimation in terms of ultimate phenomenal data . Some people are excellent drivers who can not fully explain how their motor has been built . It is not even obvious or likely that all the ingredients of such concepts are taken from the  | world of percepts . The less so since , if the concept itself is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be mainly due to mathematical reasoning . A physical world which is described in such terms can not fail to look utterly foreign to those who habitually dwell in the phenomenal world and are little acquainted with mathematics . Even the expert may easily have the same impression since , so long as symbols and operations work nicely , he is not apt and not obliged to test their ultimate foundation . Even to him mathematics may sometimes seem to be a world by itself because its connections with the phenomenal world are not easily traced . Consequently his mathematical description of physical systems will often appear as a procedure the object of which has hardly any similarity with the phenomenal world . Still ? and here we return to our main argument ? the meaning of all mathematical symbols and operations rests ultimately somewhere on phenomenal ground , though , I repeat , not necessarily in the realm of percepts . Not even the modern technique of axiomatic or implicit definitions has brought an essential change in this respect . We may reduce the number of ultimate phenomenal data , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is impossible really to eliminate them all . Often nature and the phenomenal world are said to be , if not entirely incomparable , at least totally different in particular respects . Thus , some authors find physical reality mainly characterized as a realm of quantities , while all phenomena , they say , are so essentially qualitative that quantification in psychology , for instance , would necessarily falsify the phenomenal material of this science. ? It seems doubtful whether we can really draw a sharp dividing line between quantitative and qualitative properties .  | But even if we were able to do so , it is obvious that no quantitative traits could be found in the physical world unless this were also true to some extent of the phenomenal world . The same reason applies here as before : If there were no quantitative relations whatever in the phenomenal world , if , more particularly , none of our mental operations implied quantification , the attribution of quantitative traits to physical entities could never have occurred . The term " quantitative " would have no meaning ; English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " quantitative " actually has . It is certainly true that what we call " counting " and " measuring " today is the outcome of a long historical development . But without any actual measuring everybody perceives that certain things are bigger than others , that it takes more time to walk from one village to another than through the first ; even without counting , the poor man sees that the rich man has more cattle than he has himself . Counting and measuring , beyond such primitive comparison of phenomenal amounts , includes in all cases more complicated mental operations . These operations , however , belong to the phenomenal world no less than do perceptual situations which exhibit quantitative traits in a simpler form . Once more , if in our intellectual activities as phenomenal events there were no basis for and no tendency towards definite quantification , we could never have proceeded to as much accurate measuring as is now done every day in physics . Even the transition from primitive comparison to actual measurement is sanctioned by direct awareness of their equivalence in principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this simple comparison implies that the second can be put side by side with the first , so that  | the first extends beyond both ends or at least one end of the second . If two sticks seem to have the same length in primitive comparison , there is a reasonable expectation that their ends will coincide when they are put together . Such a coincidence would not be an altogether new , independent and surprising event . And this is , in fact , the principle according to which we usually measure the length of an object . Instead of concentrating upon phenomenal extension as such , we make observations about coincidences of points , namely , of the ends of a standard object and of points along the length which we wish to measure . In primitive comparison of two phenomenal extensions , it is true , no number could as a rule be found which would express their accurate quantitative relation . Still it seems obvious that actual measuring which yields such a number refers , though indirectly , to the same thing ? extension ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomenological equivalence in principle our ancestors would hardly have invented the more indirect and at the same time more accurate procedure . Certainly we do not leave the phenomenal world , its relationships and reasonable operations , when we develop quantitative procedures . Though apparently equivalent in principle , primitive comparison and actual measurement will sometimes yield different results . Objects which seem to have different sizes in primitive comparison may have the same size when measured , and vice versa . In such cases the physicist speaks of " illusions " which are inherent either in phenomenal size or in primitive comparison . He prefers the method of measuring , i.e. , of coincidences of points , which gives him more definite results . When points coincide in phenomenal space , corresponding points are , as a rule , assumed to coincide in physical space . That science here decides in favor of the indirect procedure and against immediate appreciation is one essential step in its  | emancipation from many phenomenal data . Even so , the full meaning of measuring is not contained in the fact that , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coincides so many times in succession with certain other points . For the result is given in terms of length of a measured distance , which means that coincidences of points and the number of such coincidences are still regarded as symptoms of something else , namely , spatial extension within which those coincidences occur . Spatial extension as thus measured is , of course , not identical with phenomenal size . As so many " illusions " show , there may be contradiction as to quantity between the two . They may also differ in other respects . Nevertheless " real length " and the indirect procedure of measuring it are still related in the same sensible manner which originally made measuring a reasonable procedure . It is impossible to attribute quantitative traits to physical nature and at the same time to deny their existence in the phenomenal world . If , instead , we were told that qualitative differences are to be found only among phenomena while physical nature is a realm of pure quantities , this statement might conceivably be true . Science has discarded so many phases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete exclusion of qualitative differences might seem to be the natural end of this process . However , reduction of qualitative differences in science has never gone so far . When we speak about the " mass " of a physical object we mean one thing , when , we speak about its " length " we mean another . Nobody has , so far as I know , ever tried to show that this is a merely quantitative difference . Still it might appear as though the physicist recognized qualitative differences between a few basic concepts only . Other properties of the physical world seem to be " reduced " to these few elementary notions : to  | " mass , " " length , " " time " and , perhaps , " temperature . " A simple example : In order to know what the velocity of a moving object is we measure the distance between two points of its course , we also measure the time which is spent on this distance , and then we divide the first amount by the second . For this reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , more carelessly sometimes : to be a length divided by a time . It seems to be the belief of many that in attributing to all velocities the dimension length : time we reduce the meaning of velocity to those of length and of time . Since in a similar manner all concepts of physics are given dimensions in terms of those three or four basic concepts , it would follow that only these are essentially different , while from them the meaning of all the others could be derived . To this extent the number of irreducible physical qualia would be extremely small . I do not think that this is a correct conclusion . Take the example of a velocity . It is true , we compute a velocity by dividing the distance traversed by an object by the number which indicates how many seconds it has spent on the way . But , on the other hand , if we divide a distance by a number which indicates a certain duration , the result need not be a velocity . I may , for instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measurement that the length of the line is 10 inches . Dividing io by 5 , I get 2 . This 2 is , of course , not a velocity . Though trivial enough , this example shows how hasty we should be , if concentrating on measured quantities and a simple mathematical operation , we were to forget the background which gives a meaning to both the measuring and the operation . Many quotients may be computed which would have the dimension length : time , but only in particular cases would the quotients  | have the meaning of velocities . It can therefore not be true that the concept " velocity " is defined by its dimension . In fact , when we compute the velocity of an object it is not some distance in general which we measure , but the distance through which the object moves with the velocity in question ; and it is not some duration in general which we observe , but the time which it spends moving with this velocity through the measured distance . Thus , the concepts " movement " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point to those special lengths and times which make the simple quotient a measure of velocity . Consequently the quotient as such is not a definition of velocity ; if velocity has the dimension length : time , velocity is not thereby reduced to these simpler qualia ; " movement " and " velocity " remain unreduced basic concepts even in physics . On the other hand the usual measurement of velocities in terms of distance and time has a good phenomenological reason . In the concept of velocity as such it is implied that the greater the velocity of an object , the shorter the time which it spends on a given distance . It is this implication which gives our method of measuring velocities its sensible phenomenological basis . In this respect the connection between velocity as such and the measurement of it is strictly comparable with the relation between extension as such and its measurement by the method of point-coincidences . And again , as in the case of extension , the measurement of velocity will often contradict our more direct and primitive appreciation of speed . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct perception as illusory . This means that , once more , a " real " trait of nature is being distinguished from a corresponding trait of the phenomenal world . Nevertheless in the real world the reasonable connection between velocity as such and its measurement is preserved . It gives the measuring its meaning .  | There is a further argument against the attempt to interpret the dimensions of physical concepts as definitions of these concepts . In mechanics potential energy has the same dimension as kinetic energy . At least in this case , therefore , the dimension fails to give a difference between two meanings which doubtless have to be distinguished in physics . It would be easy to add other cases where the same is true . Conversely , one single concept of physics may have different dimensions according to the context in which it is measured . Thus , electric charge has one dimension when measured electrostatically and another dimension when measured electromagnetically . Nobody would contend that electric charge is one thing in the first case and another in the second . Again we might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or also : Electrostatically measured , electric capacity has the dimension of a length . Could anyone seriously believe that the meaning of the term " electric capacity " can be fully reduced to the meaning of " length " as such ? It follows once more that the dimensions of physical entities , though they have great value in other respects , are by no means definitions of these entities . Again , therefore , if the dimensions of all physical notions contain only a few simple concepts , the meanings of those notions are not thereby reduced to these simple concepts . The erroneous interpretation of physical dimensions as definitions would hardly be defended by any authority in the field . At least the last argument against it is too obvious . The misunderstanding occurs more frequently among stu-  | dents and among those who take an interest in physics from the outside . Still , it is significant ; because in a primitive form it represents a general trend of thought by which even the greatest scientists of our time are strongly influenced . We may call it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms with which the present discussion is not concerned . The opinion , however , which we shall next analyze refers directly to our problem . For a long time physicists have been so busy with the discovery of relevant facts and laws that they have not been able to give much attention to their own procedure , its premises and its final scope . In this respect a radical change has occurred . One scientist after another occasionally takes a few steps back from the building so that , from a distance , he may better see what it looks like as a whole . Fully aware of the fact that in the beginning of the construction much material was being used which later on had to be discarded , such critics of their own work will naturally search for more valueless ingredients that should be eliminated . The more complete the building , the stronger also the wish to remove all remnants of mere scaffolding which still disturb the clear outline of the edifice . It is in fact an intense urge for neatness , pure design and lucidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became particularly strong when Einstein showed that even our common concepts of space and time can not be applied to the physical world without a radical correction . Since then several other concepts which before had been regarded as fundamental in science have lost much of their prestige . As things are now one can sometimes hardly help feeling that such efforts might be too successful , that with the scaffolding the building itself might dis-  | appear and leave an emptiness behind , which would certainly satisfy even the highest demands of clearness . Among the most remarkable achievements of self-criticism in physics is the thesis that all observation in physics is reduced to coincidences or " pointer-readings . " A pointer-reading is the name which the physicist gives to the phenomenal fact that the pointer of an instrument is seen to coincide with a line on the instrument 's scale . " By the dropping of redundant sense data , " says Eddington , " we have reduced our observational material to pointer-readings , or more generally to coincidences . " Nor is this all ; for , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science , all sober statements about the physical world itself will be given in terms of pointerreadings ; in other words , " our knowledge of the objects treated in physics consists solely of readings of pointers and other indicators . " In the case of a particular object or situation " there is always the triple correspondence a ) a mental image , which is in our minds and not in the external world ; b ) some kind of counterpart in the external world , which is of inscrutable nature ; c ) a set of pointer-readings , which exact science can study and connect with other pointer-readings . " It follows that " none of the images which constitute our sensory perception are applicable to the physical world " ? , with the sole exception , of course , of coincidences themselves , which are primarily phenomenal data or " images . " So far as perception is concerned , therefore , the physicists seem to be giving us a picture of their world in which scarcely any resemblance is left with phenomenal material . I agree with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current scientific doctrine.2 He realizes the radicalism of this doctrine so vividly that he makes several attempts to console the layman who might find the world of mere coincidences rather dull and physics as a science of coincidences fairly disappointing . The main redeeming feature of a physical world in which only coincidences are known is the fact that such coincidences can be arranged in a " scheme of relationship , or a structure . " 3 The physicist somehow connects pointer-readings , and the results of this process are what we call " physical laws . " , If we postpone for the moment the questions which naturally arise from the last statement , we have to admit that the physicist 's building seems now to be extraordinarily neat ? not only because it contains so very little and such thoroughly homogeneous material , but also because this simple material as such , the coincidences , will by its severe precision please even extreme Puritans . However , something must be wrong with the thesis that pointer-readings and other coincidences are the only perceptual material which the physicist uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here is the story of some real facts in mere pointer-readings : 4 ; 1 ; 1887 ; 6o ; 5 ; 52 ; 7 ; 19 . The reader will be unable to understand the story . As a matter of fact , it is a simple report about the author 's childhood : " He was born , as the 4th child of his parents , in the 1st month of 1887 , under the 6oth degree of northern latitude . When 5 years old he went to a town under the 52nd 2 The above quotations are from A. Eddington 's New Pathways in Science . 1934. pp. 16 , 18 ; and from The Nature of the Physical World . 1928. pp. 254 , 258. 3 New Pathways in Science , p. 16.  | degree of northern latitude where from his 7th till his 19th year he went to school . " What I have added now does not refer to colors , feelings and other phenomena which really seem to have no place in modern reports on physical facts . It refers to those notions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are nothing but indifferent numbers . It refers besides to the manner in which the pointer-readings " cohere " or are to be connected so that we get a story and not a mere aggregate . Let us apply this to physics proper . It is a minor point that , in general , coincidences have physical significance only , if they are observed with reference to a scale , in terms of which the point in question is found to be " 7 " or " 18.4 " and so on . If on an instrument such numbers should be found right underneath or above the point in question , such percepts are , of course , only substitutes for the fact that others , those who made the instrument , have in their world of percepts looked upon this point with reference to the zero-point of the scale . All this , I repeat , is rather unimportant , though it gives us a first glimpse of phenomenal data which we tend to ignore when we use the apparently simple terms " coincidences " or " pointerreadings " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in physics . It is much more important that in physics the pointerreadings are numbers which have various names . The . name may be " ohms , " if we measure electric resistance ; " am. peres , " if we measure the intensity of a current ; " degrees , " if we measure temperature ; " miles per hour , " if we look upon the speedometer of our car ; " atmospheres , " if we measure air-pressure ; " grams , " if we measure mass ? and so on through the whole domain of physics . A mere coin-  | cidence as such does not tell us with which of all these possibilities we are dealing in a given case ? not even if we include the reference to the scale as a whole when speaking of " the coincidence . " Quite apart from such names as indicate the various units of measurement , we must evidently have some source of information which tells us whether a coincidence before us means so much of " resistance " or " current " or " temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " mass " ? and so on . There may be , it is true , some names on the instruments which indicate what they all are meant to measure . But such percepts again are unimportant and obviously once more mere substitutes for something more essential . Where is this more essential evidence which in each case gives pointer-readings their right names ? It can not come from mere thinking which , as such , would have no reason to give the name of " pressure " in one definite case rather than in any other . No doubt , something in percepts ? however much pervaded by thinking ? must enable us to apply the right names to all the various coincidences . And at this point it will begin to be much clearer that coincidences as such are by no means the phenomenal material of physics . Obviously two questions are to be answered , if we wish to make any reasonable use of pointer-readings : first , such words as " resistance , " " current , " " temperature , " " velocity , " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , secondly , we must be able to decide which of these various entities we are , in a particular experimental situation , about to measure by a pointer-reading . The first question brings us back to the problem of definitions in physics . That these are not given by socalled " dimensions " has been shown above . In one of his books Professor Eddington discusses the problem of defini-  | tions , and indicates that the meanings of physical terms constitute an endless cycle in which one term refers to others , these again to others and so on , until some step leads back to the point where we happened to ask for the meaning of a first term . ' Familiar conceptions , he says , have gradually disappeared from the list of physical terms . Their places are now occupied by mere symbols of entities whose nature we do not claim to know . And it is these symbols which , in reference to each other , fill the cycle . One might wish that at this point a more detailed report had been given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations.5 Whatever the symbols may be when we meet them on pages of the Philosophical Magazine , or any other journal of physics , the experimentalist must be able to decide to what concrete data of his perceptible experimental set-up the various symbols refer ? and vice versa . Otherwise he could not verify or refute by experimentation what the mathematical physicist predicts in terms of his symbols . It follows that so long as the symbols are of any use in physics their meanings must contain not only phenomenal ingredients in general ; rather they must refer to specific aspects of perceptual situations , since it is in these that all symbolic activities of the theorist are eventually tested.6 This means on the one hand that we must have as many different and characteristic perceptual situations as we 4 The Nature of the Physical World , pp. 247 if . 5 In New Pathways in Science ( pp. 102 f . ) I find the statement : We must make sure that the quantities or characters that we speak about are directly or indirectly definable in terms of experience ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me quite true . But what is the relation of this statement to those to which I refer in the text ? 6 This must be true at least of several symbols . I do not overlook the fact that some concepts like " entropy " or " action " refer to perceptual data via other concepts for which the reference is direct .  | have symbols , the theoretically computed behavior of which is to be examined in the laboratory . On the other hand , I repeat , it means that each of these symbols must by its definition be strictly coordinated with one particular perceptual situation . It can therefore not be a correct thesis that the physicist 's symbols are merely defined in a selfsufficient cycle of mere symbols . The reader will not be uncautious enough to propose that the perceptual data in question are the pointer-readings of experimental physics . This would only lead us back to our original predicament : Pointer-readings as such are the same perceptual data whatever we intend to measure . What we need are different perceptual contexts inside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " current " now , " pressure " another time , and so on . Once more , beyond mere coincidences which are a common feature of all experimental tests , there must be as many distinguishable phenomenal situations in laboratories as we have symbols to test . And it would help us quite as little if one should say that a first pointer-reading should be interpreted in the light of another pointer-reading . So long as the second is nothing but a mere coincidence precisely as the first , so long as no " qualification " is given to it by a larger perceptual context , ? it could throw no light on the first coincidence . No amount of pointer-readings as such could change this state of affairs . Ten blind persons do not see more than a single blind man . It amounts then to this : All the more basic entities of physics , those which have citizenship both in actual experimentation and in theory , are ultimately defined with reference to concrete perceptual situations ? now as they always have been . There is a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation , a " temperature " - situation , a " pressure " - situation in perception . If these situations did not tell us what we are measuring , no pointer-reading would have any sense ; and if symbols did not refer to such situations , they would not have the slightest contact with experimental facts ? which , of course , are phenomenal facts . A short time ago I distinguished two tasks : The first was to discover the source of the meanings of all the essential terms which we find used by the physicists . The second would be solved , if in experimental situations we could always decide to which of these entities a particular pointer-reading actually belongs . We realize now that in both cases the solution is the same . As in certain perceptual situations the meaning of the term " electric current " is given , so additional data in the same perceptual situations will tell us that the pointer before us indicates by its position " inc tensity of current . " The additional percepts consist in the structure of an apparatus , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the situation , the circuit . Not much is changed by the fact that some thinking will have to accompany our perception of a situation if it is to be fully understood . Such thinking remains focussed on the percepts in question and perhaps on ideas which represent further physical situations. ? Again , it is hardly essential that a " current " - situation may vary in many perceptual details . In the structure of " current " - situations there must be some invariants which characterize such situations independently of all unessential perceptual traits by which they differ . Give a physicist sufficient time , and he will recognize a " current " - situation , even if all the local parts of it are of unusual shape . I admit , he will have to do some thinking . But such thinking can lead to correct  | recognition only so long as the fundamental symptoms of a " current " - situation are present , and as the thinking refers to these . It is again to these invariants of certain perceptual situations that the mathematical vector-symbol for " current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen , the symbol would be meaningless in empirical science . The same reasoning applies , of course , to other physical concepts . Symbols are therefore ultimately defined in perceptual contexts , and all the various pointer-readings have their specific meanings in such contexts . For mathematical purposes we may eliminate from these contexts whatever is not strictly essential , until at last the residuum seems hardly to have much affinity with perception . This process is desirable in so far as its result is meant to be of general use apart from all accidental traits in individual cases . Still , for reasons which now ought to be evident , some remnants of structure must be left in which the meanings of the " abstract " symbols agree with perceptual situations . There is almost a humorous touch in the fact that , with all our aversion to mere percepts , eventually the symbol as a rather obvious percept should absorb our attention altogether , and that , by contrast , we should overlook the little delicate spider-web of phenomenal structure which , as its meaning , still adheres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomenal structure which gives each symbol of the theorist a definite place in the perceptual world of experimentation . In this world corresponding structures appear in more concrete phenomenal " materializations , " and thus the right coordinations of symbols and facts become possible . Eddington speaks of the scheme of relationship , the structure , in which the physicist puts his pointer-readings.  | As he uses these terms they refer to general relationships which we call " physical laws . " We are at present not concerned with these . Apart from general laws , however , concrete experimental situations are perceptual contexts within which the various pointer-readings have definite places and significance directly . Since the physical meaning of the pointer-readings is defined in these contexts it follows that , beyond the phenomenal world , we attribute to the physical world similar structures in which the corresponding physical coincidences occur . The structure in which we actually arrange the physical coincidences is in its basic scheme given with the pointer-readings in perception . Consequently not only phenomenal coincidences are used in the construction of the physical world ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumed to be common traits of perception and of physical existence . Physical structures in this sense are different from perceptual structures in that they may not " look " or " feel " like perceptual contexts . For this reason and for the sake of accuracy we prefer to describe physical structures mathematically . But in all major respects the same procedure might be applied to perceptual structures . And what I wish to point out is merely that in such a description the most essential traits of experimental or perceptual contexts are the same as those of their physical counterparts . With respect to these traits the perceptual and the physical structures are isomorphic . If they were not , we could have no physics . It seems reasonable to assume that an analysis of " physical laws " as general and abstract structures would lead to about the same result . The terms which we combine in physical laws refer to those entities ( " current , " " resistance , " " magnetic field , " etc. ) whose meaning is given in definite perceptual situ-  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical entities be combined in one particular physical law or " structure , " if there were no experiential , i.e. , perceptual , context that would ask for just this combination ? In actual fact , we do not observe a " resistance " - situation by itself , a " current " - situation by itself , and so on . Rather , one observational context has , in addition to a " current " - aspect , a " resistance " - aspect , a " magnetic " and several other aspects . The theorist will have to admit , I believe , that in the given context these aspects occur in a definite structural relationship , that the quantitative side of this relationship is expressed in a physical law , and that the terms of the law are tacitly conceived to be in that structural connection which we have before us in the experimental situation as a perceptual context . In this sense the structure of the law is not , by pure thought , inexplicably added to an aggregate of mere pointer-readings . With their observational structure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical world ; and it is this structure which also holds the terms of a physical law together . To abstract from observational physics the essentials or invariants of all the different experimental " situations " ? and thus the ultimate meanings of corresponding physical concepts ? is hard work , which I leave to the epistemologists of science . Even so we may describe some of the consequences which , for the nature of the physical world , follow from our argument about the pointer-readings . A few examples will make it clearer than general explanations what is meant by a common structure of perceptual and physical situations . And such examples need not be technical . At first the foreign aspect which Eddington attributes to the physical world may seem to be little changed by the discussion of the last paragraphs . As a matter of fact the change is radical .  | Pointer-readings belong together in concrete situations . This applies to them as perceptual entities ; it also applies to their counterparts , the physical coincidences . Thus , the observations which we make on one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one physical object in the physical world . This is implied in many statements of Eddington 's . We have , however , to stress the fact explicitly , since in consequence of it the physical world " of mere coincidences " acquires a fairly familiar aspect . An elephant , for instance , ? whom Eddington takes as an example ? " is a tube in the four-dimensional world demarcated from the rest of space-time by a more or less abrupt boundary . " ' Under normal conditions the Theory of Relativity may here be neglected , because the elephant is not apt to move past our eyes or other instruments with anything approaching the velocity of light . We are therefore allowed to split the four-dimensional world of space-time into space and time , and to consider the elephant as an entity in space which has a certain fate in time .

Should the elephant lose one of his huge tusks , perception would show us two separate things where we had one before . But pointer-readings would reveal that the same is true of the physical elephant and his physical tusk , since from now on these two objects would move freely in relation to each other . In the language of Relativity Theory , the elephant-tube in space-time 7 The Nature of the Physical World , p. 256.  | has split into a tube for a less symmetrical elephant and a smaller tube for the lost tusk . The normal elephantpercept has four legs , two tusks , one trunk and one tail as parts which stand out from the more compact remainder , their lengths being considerable in comparison with their diameters . However abstractly we may formulate corresponding data in the physical world , their meaning there is precisely the same . In other words : As to his main structural traits the elephant of physics agrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has four legs , two tusks , one trunk and one tail , even if you speak of them in terms of pointer-readings.8 In an elephant there is nothing in particular which would forbid us to generalize these statements . I see three people before me on the street , and three physical people are there on the physical street . Visually each of them has two legs and one head ; a spider on the wall eight legs and one head . The structures of pointer-readings which the physicist would transfer to the physical world will in these cases again preserve all such traits without any essential alteration . We need no further examples , of trees , of houses , pieces of furniture , books , pencils and other fa8 Eddington , I must remark here , would not commit himself to the opinion that the twoness of two physical objects is " just like " the twoness of two percepts ; or , in other words , that integers should be " freely displaced " from the world of experience to that of physical entities ( New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . I can not say whether the twoness of two physical objects is just like that of two percepts . It seems to me , however , that integers of the physical world must he like those of the phenomenal world to that extent , that fundamental mathematical operations can be applied to both in the same sense and according to the same rules . Otherwise , what meaning would the term integers have in physics ? And what meaning would the methods of mathematical physics and many statements of the chemist have ? I grant that the use of integers in physics has its limitations and may mislead us in certain cases ; but every psychologist knows that the same is true of their application to phenomenal data .  | miliar things.9 For the most part not only their numbers as distinct thing-percepts but also the major characteristics of their structural make-up are the same physically and in perception . Even if there is an occasional exception , as when in dim light we may have one thing-percept where two objects are present physically , what does it matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rule holds in general ? 10 It would not be amiss to say that in all these cases it is really structure in which the world of percepts and the physical world have so much in common . Resemblance as to the demarcation of definite objects , and therefore to their number , means in fact similarity in the gross structure of the two worlds . And then inside such particular objects there is again structural resemblance between the perceptual and the physical world . In this respect , too , the resemblance may go very far indeed . A ring is in perception a figure characterized by the peculiarity that , around something else , it bends back upon itself . If the corresponding physical object is described by the physicist , will he deny this topological fact ? No , it belongs to both worlds . Or again : Before me I see a river separating its two banks . Is the physical river not between the two physical banks ? It is . This structure or arrangement of the 9 In the Introduction to The Nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table , the chair and the pen in his perceptual study there correspond a table , a chair and a pen in the physical study . But this resemblance between the perceptual and the physical world is not given much attention when in his chapter on pointer-readings the same author represents the physicist 's world as a pattern of mere symbols quite unlike the world of percepts. 10I should perhaps remark in passing that our argument often applies to events as they follow each other in time : I count to beats of two tuning-forks which have approximately the same frequency of vibration . How many oscillations of intensity would be found in the corresponding stretch of physical waves ?

If you do not add that , besides , the concrete structure of the two worlds is nearly the same in many respects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of percepts the scientist leaves his home , walks along some streets and passes through the entrance-door into his observatory . All this can be described in terms of pointer-readings ; but , if these pointer-readings are to have any physical significance whatsoever , they must be structurally related . When they are carried over from the phenomenal to the physical world , essential phases of their structural framework accompany them from the perceptual to the other domain . And then we find that the scientist as a physical object moves physically from his physical home through physical streets into his physical observatory , precisely as the scientist-percept does in relation to corresponding thing-percepts . I think it is a consolation.11 In some of our examples ? the elephant , the people and the spider , the ring ? the similarity between physical and perceptual structure approaches an agreement in form . Where the thing-percept has a protruding part the same is true of the physical object . The ring has a hole both phenomenally and physically . Not infrequently such a resemblance approximates the level of quantitative exact11 The reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be easily made . It is not possible to reduce the structure of pointerreadings or other coincidences to more pointer-readings as such . Even the fact that , in a particular case , two pointer-readings give by their difference a distance in space , not a difference in mass , can only be recognized by reference to something which is not in itself a pointer-reading.  | ness . Before me I have a simple electric condenser which consists of two metal plates . When looking at the instrument from one side I have right before me a perceptual circle which is one of the plates . When measuring the plate I find it to be physically symmetrical around a central point . But this is a structural trait which is also implied in the perceptual circle. ? Or again , when changing my position appropriately I discover that as percepts the two plates are plane surfaces parallel to each other . Physical measurement shows that the same is true of the physical plates ; or at least it gives me data which are structurally equivalent to such traits of the perceptual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than direct inspection of the percepts . It will reveal slight deviations from those regularities where simple perception reaches its limits of accuracy . Still , up to this point isomorphism is almost complete . Eddington emphasizes the fact that we can never say what physical things are ultimately made of . If this be granted , it does not follow that , apart from coincidences and abstract laws of their connection , the physical world is hidden to our understanding . As a rule it contains objects ? whatever their ultimate nature ? where we perceive things . Structurally there is much resemblance between thing-percepts and corresponding physical objects . Such objects are commonly related in physical space more or less as thing-percepts are in phenomenal space . If those physical objects change their locations , the same is generally true of corresponding percepts . I need hardly repeat that the phenomenal and the physical worlds differ widely in other respects . Few qualitative traits of perception , and perhaps no subjective ' phenomena , are attributed to physical nature . Direct perception may also deceive us  | about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this respect and in general , never reach the accuracy of indirect measurement . It does not easily reveal most of the electric and magnetic properties of the physical world ? which accounts for the fact of their later discovery . It completely hides the atomic sub-structure of physical objects . Nevertheless , in their " macroscopic " structure phenomenal and physical situations resemble each other closely enough . The " macroscopic " or " molar " aspect of the physical world , however , is sometimes regarded almost as an illusion . Modern natural science is atomistic . We find at present most of experimental and mathematical physics concerned with such entities as molecules , ions , atoms , electrons , protons , neutrons , and so on . Knowledge of these particles and of their behavior may easily seem to be the only goal of science . The particles themselves will consequently appear as the only " real " content of nature . Since under normal circumstances perception does not give the slightest indication of their existence , in this respect at least the difference between the phenomenal world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes to give this impression a disturbing touch . The pavement , he would say , on which you walk along the street , is for the most part empty space . Li so much emptiness tiny electric charges rush about here and there , and it is only the ever-repeated impulses of such charges which keep your feet and all the rest of you " above the ground . " Counted in cubic centimeters of stone there are a great many of them ? and this fact makes you float along the surface  | with a feeling of safety . It remains none the less true that , compared with the empty part of the pavement , those bits of charge fill hardly any space whatsoever . To this extent you are virtually walking on holes . This achievement , it is true , may appear more plausible if you learn that exactly the same reasoning applies to your feet and to your organism in general . As a physical object you are at least as much empty space as the pavement is . Comparatively speaking , it is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiniest particles of your organism to the very next . But you are not likely to enjoy this picture of your own looseness any better than that of a pavement composed mainly of nothing . I do not think that this description of physical objects is quite adequate . Before we criticize it , however , we should perhaps consider to what extent the atomic nature of the physical world agrees or disagrees with earlier arguments of this chapter . According to these arguments the meaning of all concepts which we use in describing physical entities and events is ultimately derived from phenomenal data . Does this hold in the case of atomic entities and their behavior ? Atomistic hypotheses were developed long before any observation could demonstrate the " atomic constitution " of the physical world . It is obvious that in such early assumptions an atom and similar concepts were conceived after the model of larger empirical objects which move freely as wholes , and are not easily divided into parts . It was merely the small size of atoms , their more perfect elasticity and the higher degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from ordinary things . In other words , the atoms of earlier atomistic thinking had no properties the type of which was  | not well known from common phenomenal experience . The history of the kinetic theory of gases and of the theory of solutions proves clearly how much could be achieved even with these primitive concepts . Since then atomism in physics has undergone a fundamental change . However , the decisive characteristic of this change did not at first consist in the development of more refined conceptions of the atom and smaller particles . This development was made possible only by the more fundamental fact that the atomic constitution of the physical world , until then a matter of theory only , became accessible to more direct observation . The paths of single particles were , by Wilson 's method , rendered visible on the photographic plate . The impulses of single atoms ? or ions ? of helium could be observed and counted as discrete " scintillations " on a surface of appropriately chosen material . From the realm of hypotheses the atomic constitution of nature , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of perceptual facts . It is this progress which immediately affected the knowledge of particles so much that their velocity , their electric charge , their mass , soon became accurately determined data , and that the atom began to reveal its inner structure . Among these new discoveries there were at first only few in which the behavior of particles was found to differ considerably from the previously known behavior of larger objects . Discreteness of the path of one electron , as shown by Wilson 's procedure , means essentially the same as discreteness of the movement of one stone or one cloud ; as a common electric charge , when moved , constitutes an electric current , so does the quickly moving electron ; and as the magnetic field displaces a common current , so does it bend the path of the electron .  | Not until quantum physics demonstrated a strange discontinuity in the behavior of atomic entities and of light was there any serious suspicion that customary notions did not apply to the remotest properties of nature . Precisely what concepts will eventually prove adequate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No physicists will assume that such concepts can wholly correspond to familiar ideas as directly abstracted from the behavior of thing-percepts . Nevertheless , even the most foreign symbolic language in which at present the theorist makes his statements on quantum physics remains physically meaningful only to the extent to which this language points ultimately back to some phenomenal sources and to possible verification in perceptual situations . If some property of the quantum or of photons should prove unintelligible in any phenomenal terms , it would necessarily remain inaccessible forever . As a matter of fact , however , quantum physics tends not toward remoteness from perceptual facts but rather toward the elimination of all concepts with which no observable fact could correspond even under ideal conditions of observation . The atomic constitution of nature appears in corresponding perception only if the physicist makes use of particular devices which have been invented for the purpose . Direct observation of thing-percepts and their behavior will hardly ever give any evidence of atomic facts . As a rule thingpercepts seem to us " dense , " " continuous " and , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in question are said to consist of discrete particles , widely scattered in otherwise empty space and rapidly moving in all possible directions . If this be the truth about physical objects we seem forced to confess that perception is to an amazing degree illusory , giving us as it does the impression of definite continuous  | large-scale objects which behave as wholes . It may be a correct statement that all physical entities of which we can know must be akin to some phenomenal data . But with the same basic colors obviously altogether different paintings may be produced ; and nature seems patterned after a scheme which does not agree with the pattern of perception . Nature , its entities and the laws of their behavior , seem to have a thoroughly microscopic constitution , while thing-percepts and their behavior are essentially macroscopic . Since the physicist himself uses these terms in application not to the atomic constitution of nature on the one hand and to the " molar " pattern of perception on the other , but to two different sides of nature , we should not too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an illusory subjective impression . Only a few decades ago atomic events became directly accessible to experimental research . It is not surprising that the opportunity of investigating an almost entirely new field should for a time absorb the physicist 's interest altogether . Influenced by this attitude of the expert the layman is apt to give less importance to that vast-body of physical knowledge which had been built up before the era of atomic research . What was the characteristic of such knowledge , since it could not yet be truly atomistic ? It was , as a matter of experimental experience , wholly macroscopic . Atomistic theories existed and were certainly most influential in chemistry and in thermodynamics . The only way of testing their validity , however , consisted in the verification or refutation of such conclusions as followed from the atomistic assumptions for the case of macroscopic observation . All matters of fact were therefore macroscopic facts , and all directly verified laws were macroscopic laws . This means that the physical  | objects in question corresponded to macroscopic percepts , and that the laws referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not become obsolete and useless , because in the meantime modern tools have transformed atomistic speculation into atomic facts . Ohm 's law as applied to stationary currents in metals and electrolytes ? a typical macroscopic law ? is not wrong because now we know about electrons and ions . In fact , in this particular field observational physics is still about as macroscopic as it was forty years ago . On conductors electric charges still assume a distribution in which electrostatic energy has the smallest possible amount ; this law is not changed by the fact that such charges consist of electric particles . Surface tension still gives a liquid surface the smallest possible area whatever the atomic constitution of the liquid may be . And independently of their molecular make-up macroscopic objects swim in water according to Archimedes ' principle . Even if all these are old stories for the physicist of our time they are not thereby rendered less true . On the contrary , he will agree that such parts of physical knowledge will probably never be profoundly altered by future research . Just as these laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are macroscopic objects which have a macroscopic volume , a macroscopic shape and macroscopic boundaries . The mercury in a glass tube does not only consist of particles which are , as particles , different from those of the glass ; but macroscopic physics considers the behavior of the volume of mercury as physically demarcated from the behavior of the glass ? notwithstanding their mutual dynamic relation . The object which swims in water according to Archimedes ' principle is regarded  | as one thing , the water as another , though at the same time their dynamic relationship is fully realized . In both cases the implication is not only that throughout one such object chemical properties are often approximately the same , but also that the chemically homogeneous material forms a natural unit in physical behavior . It is , however , not necessary that different units or objects should be chemically different in order to remain macroscopically demarcated from each other . In elastic or semi-elastic impact two billiard balls are two definite macroscopic objects with definite boundaries , although both consist of the same material ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implied . Conversely , often one object may consist of several substances . When a physicist tells us that a macroscopic object is " really " a swarm of particles , do we understand him correctly if we assume that atomic physics does not recognize the existence of definite macroscopic objects ? Are macroscopic objects dissolved into particles ? At first it might appear as though only one aspect , either the microscopic or the macroscopic , could correspond with physical facts . And yet there is no such alternative . Both the demarcation of macroscopic objects and their atomic constitution are legitimate notions which are well founded on physical evidence . Particles do occur as separate entities . They are also " real " parts of macroscopic objects . But functionally they are not quite the same entities in the second as in the first case . In macroscopic objects they mutually influence each others ' behavior in such a manner that their individual freedom is very much restricted . Their positions , their displacements and their velocities are no longer altogether independent data ; for each particle moves " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versa . The forces  | which constitute this field are due to the electric charges of the particles . Their general effect is that , under given conditions of temperature , the average distances between the particles tend to remain approximately constant . In liquids this leads to constancy of volume , in solid objects to constancy both of shape and of volume . With a change of temperature the average distance of the particles increases or decreases while the particles themselves move more quickly or more slowly . So long , however , as the object does not in any considerable amount emit single particles in the form of a gas , its volume remains one definite context of particles which are held together by their mutual forces . Even if there is some evaporation or , conversely , absorption and adsorption of gaseous particles , the object has at a given time a fairly well defined boundary within which particles cohere dynamically in one macroscopic context of particular intimacy . Such a context is no less " real " than are the particles . So far as we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by specific interaction , and that the boundaries of these volumes are the boundaries of such cohesion , so far the concept of macroscopic objects as physical entities is fully justified . One side of nature would be ignored if our present interest in microscopic physics were to make us overlook the existence of macroscopic contexts of particles . Such contexts are not products of illusion , their boundaries are not arbitrarily selected for subjective reasons ; they are given data of the physical world . Thus we have not to choose between the microscopic and macroscopic aspect of nature . Both aspects of the physical world are founded on objective facts ; they represent different levels of physical organization . Even in microscopic physics we find several levels of such  | organization . Most atoms , for example , are highly complicated structures . Nobody denies the existence of their components , electrons and positive nuclei . At the same time the structure , i.e. , the atom , is everywhere recognized as a definite entity which can not be described by a simple enumeration of all its components . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and therefore the atom-unit is certainly not an arbitrary concept. ? Again in one molecule , sometimes a few , sometimes hundreds of atoms are held together by their fields . No physicist would say that we have to decide whether we wish to acknowledge either the atoms or the molecule . Both are definite entities , both concepts agree with physical data , two levels of physical organization have clearly to be distinguished in one microscopic object . Similarly , a macroscopic object represents merely a product of organization at a still higher level . It contains particles , ? molecules , ions and others . Such particles , however , have lost much of their independence . And as inside a molecule an atom is doubtless not quite the same thing as it would be in complete freedom , so at least the behavior of a molecule is , inside a macroscopic object , strongly determined in this larger context . We are certainly much better informed about macroscopic objects , now that we have some definite knowledge of their atomic or molecular constitution . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at present the coherence , the demarcation and the macroscopic behavior of a definite large-scale object is much better understood than it was before . Obviously , progress in this direction can not mean that atomistic theory of macroscopic objects denies their existence as definite entities . Although the existence of macroscopic things is a com-  | mon feature of perception and of nature , at least the apparent continuity of thing-percepts seems illusory when compared with the atomic constitution of corresponding physical objects . I should , however , hesitate to admit even this much . When we hear that the pavement of the street , that our table and that our organism are much more empty space than anything else , the underlying notion is clearly that particles are tiny bits of " matter , " that where we have such matter there is " really " something , while between particles in this sense there is not much worth mentioning . One does not see why in popular presentations of physical knowledge such descriptions should still be repeated . Meant to warn the layman against an anthropomorphic conception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where in present physics do we find any convincing evidence for the assumption that " particles " are in fact what the old term seems to indicate , namely extremely small portions of something called " matter " with a measurable diameter and a sharp boundary ? Democritus could have such a notion when he thought of atoms as of tiny editions of macroscopic things . But , quite apart from quantum physics and its severe criticism of similar ideas , a physicist can hardly share this view in our times . Is the " field " of an electron less reliable a physical entity than " the electron itself " ? And what does it really mean , if , at least by the terms of our language , we still distinguish between the electron and its field ? I do not know of any empirical evidence which would support the distinction . It seems to be a remnant of old materialistic conceptions : these conceptions yielded the " particle of matter " ; then , after Faraday and Maxwell , the particle became surrounded by a field . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fields , as though ?  | in the case of the pavement ? we could safely tread on particles but should beware of " mere field . " As a matter of fact , insofar as " particles " are known to be fields and field-structures they fill the volume of a macroscopic object completely , and to this extent the object is a continuum . It is only as a field-continuum that it coheres . And the support which the pavement gives to our feet is entirely due to this continuum . It will not yield unless much stronger forces than our weight are applied . If a macroscopic object is functionally or dynamically a continuum ? it would crumble at once , if it were not ? perception fails to reveal only one important aspect of the thing : This is the irregular vibratory unrest by which the object is constantly pervaded , and which , from the standpoint of physics , is its content of heat-energy . The vibrations as such are microscopic in nature and , being microscopic , they do in fact not appear in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in the demonstration of Brown 's movement , permit us even remotely to approach a direct perception of so much motion . On quantum physics . The last paragraphs may seem to contradict the point of view of modern physics in one respect . A macroscopic object , I said , is held together by forces ; and the same object is a continuum as a fieldstructure . Both the concept of force and that of field involve the idea of causality . But this idea is , according to some authorities , no longer accepted as valuable in physics ; its place has been taken by the concept of probability . At first probability was a partner of causality ? in thermodynamics for instance ; then causality began to be regarded as a superfluous notion ? in quantum physics , ? so that at present probability reigns alone and supreme .  | It is essential , not only for the argument of this chapter , that such statements be regarded with some suspicion . The most striking argument against causality in physics is contained in Heisenberg 's Principle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events we should be able to state exactly in what conditions a physical entity is found at a given moment , so that , with adequate knowledge of a definite causal law , we might predict in what conditions we shall find the same entity a short time afterwards . Such conditions can not be accurately observed , however , for reasons which seem to belong to the constitution of the physical world . Observation itself will alter the physical situation , because observation is not possible without a physical interrelation between the entity observed and the observer or his instruments . And since the amount of such interrelation or interference can not be reduced to less than a definite quantity , a limit is set to the accuracy with which we are allowed to know about actual states of the entity which we observe . Thus the " real " position of an entity and its " real " velocity ? or at least one of these two characteristics for a given case ? become within certain limits doubtful notions . If , instead , we speak about mere **25;1111;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we remain in the realm of observable facts . But when we have come this far we discover that causality has been lost on our way . Causality implies determination and prediction , and in our new physics of **25;1138;TOOLONG there is apparently no determination and no prediction . It seems to follow that there is no causality in such a physics either . I have intentionally oversimplified this description of the theoretical situation in order to avoid a difficult technical discussion . We have to be specific , however , at least  | in so far as the Principle of Indeterminacy has significance for microscopic events only . Electrons and their behavior tend to disappear in a cloud ? or in waves ? of uncertainty , but not events in macroscopic dimensions . Their physics is not measurably altered by Heisenberg 's theorem . Should we conclude , then , that the concept of causality applies to macroscopic physics , while the same notion is valueless in the microscopic world ? It seems difficult to hold this view . If there is no causation in microscopic events , a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a " combined " probability-distribution to which the notion of causality could no more apply than it does to one microscopic event . I doubt whether under these circumstances the existence of relatively permanent macroscopic objects could be made plausible . In fact , such a dissolution of the physical world has never been proposed in quantum physics . We speak of causation when the behavior of an entity , a datum , an " observable " is found to be altered by or to depend on the presence of other entities , data or observables . Special causal laws describe particular cases of such alteration or dependence . More cautious terms than these may be used . In a Positivistic mood we might say , for instance , that causal laws refer to a regular correlation of observable facts . It does not matter for our problem . This problem is whether or not causation , as physical dependence or as correlation , is attributed to microscopic events by quantum physics . It seems fairly obvious that it is . The most popular introduction of Heisenberg 's principle starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ momentum ( or velocity ) of which are to be measured . In order to measure we observe ; and in order to observe we expose the  | particle to light . If the light is capable of giving an accurate measurement of position , it will by its impact change the momentum of the particle . If , on the other hand , we try to reduce this disturbance , our measurement of position will become correspondingly less accurate . The difficulty is due to the fact that light energy does not occur in amounts which are smaller than Planck 's quanta ; it is a difficulty in principle . Thus we find that for an electron the concepts of accurate position and of accurate velocity have only a limited meaning . Consequently statistical concepts have to replace the idea of causality. ? It can hardly be denied that in this argument , when literally interpreted , the fact of one special causal relation which is involved in any observation is said to destroy causality . We may not be expected to know in a given case precisely what change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But on the authority of a famous experiment of Compton 's it is assumed that impact of light and change of momentum in general are " correlated " physical facts . To this extent causality is not eliminated by quantum physics . Quantum physics does not rely on probabilities exclusively . It recognizes , even in microscopic events , such connectivity of observables as is implied in the terms " dependence " or " alteration , " although it abstains from the notion of complete determination . The same conclusion follows if we consider that the concept of " field " is freely used in the modern theory of microscopic events . As a matter of fact , one of the first tasks which the new theories solved refers to the behavior of electrons and other particles when under the influence of a field of force . The meaning of such terms implies causality in quantum physics . Even if forces or the mutual dependence of phys-  | ical entities could not be accurately determined , even if , here again , probabilities would have to replace more definite data , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependence or correlation , i.e. , of causation , and those probabilities which refer to the correlated entities , their positions and their velocities . In any case quantum theory assumes without hesitation that in the neighborhood of the positively charged nucleus of an atom electrons are deflected towards the nucleus and positive particles away from it . This is causation ; and it remains causation , even though the electrons and positive particles are not in every respect strictly describable entities . Quite apart from probabilities , the positive nucleus has one influence on the negative electron and the opposite influence on a positive particle . Since the status of neither is clearly defined before the causal event , the same will be true during this event itself . Consequently quantum physics shows not how individual particles , but how the probability-distribution of particles is affected by their passing through the field of the nucleus . The new development will probably lead to a reformulation of the principle of causality . But even at the present time it can safely be said that this principle will by no means be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But determinism in this sense is the assumption that the description of causal relations can be differentiated ad libitum , down to any arbitrarily chosen degree of detail . Even if there is something in nature ? the quantum ? which makes this a meaningless proposition , we can not for this reason conclude that all " determination " of the behavior of one physical entity by the presence of another is a myth . Determination or causation in general pervades the system of physics now as it did before the time of  | quantum physics . And this is true at the microscopic as well as at the macroscopic level of physical events . It is time to look back . A short discussion of quantum physics became necessary in connection with the concept of macroscopic physical objects . Such objects can not be defined and described without reference to causal relations . We had to show , therefore , that , contrary to superficial appearance , causality is ? with certain restrictions ? still a valid notion in modern science . Thus the outcome of our discussion validates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To look still farther back : We were interested in macroscopic objects for the following reason . Physics , it was stated , proceeds on the assumption that certain structural traits of percepts agree with the structure of corresponding physical situations . It is , however , only macroscopic structures which can be common characteristics of the perceptual and the physical world . And this statement has sense only if the notion of macroscopic objects is found to refer to definite physical entities . We have , I believe , been able to show that it does . It is therefore a meaningful thesis that perceptual and physical contexts are isomorphic in essential macroscopic respects , and that to this extent there is resemblance between the phenomenal and the physical world . In the next chapter it will be shown why this is relevant insight for the main purpose of our investigation .  | IN many branches of philosophy we have to overcome extreme intellectual difficulties ; but in the following discussion the obstacles will belong rather to the emotional sphere . I propose to consider the nature of cortical processes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain when philosophical problems are being discussed . To some extent this aversion has historical reasons . Philosophy still remembers the time when , after the fall of Hegelianism in Germany , the pendulum began to swing toward the other side , and Materialistic notions became quite popular for a while . It was the principal mistake of this movement that it represented mental life as the product of something altogether different and , doubtless , functionally inferior . For in those years crude ideas about matter and its behavior predominated in science . Still cruder ideas were held by those who in their Materialistic doctrines tried to apply science where , with its insufficient knowledge , it could not really be applied . On the other hand , some of the essential characteristics of mental life were well known to philosophers . For this purpose no special research is needed . The very simplest observation will find some structural traits of mental operations for which there are no analogues in the realm of " moving matter . " The statement , therefore , that mental  | life is a product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very clear meaning . Consequently the philosopher might well have shrugged his shoulders , if it had not been for one reason : Whoever made such statements must either be blind to the essential characteristics of mental life , or else he had ' to interpret them as mere illusions . Supposing now that for the philosopher the very essence of human nature and value is expressed in such traits of mental activity , we must expect him to regard Materialism as a serious danger . So , as a matter of fact , he did , and most philosophers still do so . But they do more . Concepts and words are in one respect similar to sponges . If for generations an object has been highly valued , the corresponding concept and even its verbal symbol will eventually be thoroughly impregnated with dignity ? precisely as a sponge absorbs a liquid by which it is surrounded . In a case of aversion both the concept and its name will soon be charged with negative qualities . While it is not easy to dry a wet sponge entirely and quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept those value-qualities which it has once absorbed. ? I am not in the least disturbed by the fact that the term " Materialism " will not easily lose its unpleasant sound . But it disturbs all serious discussion of several problems in philosophy that such terms as " organism , " " body " and " brain " should share the same fate . When Materialism became a concept with dangerous implications these entities acquired a negative character at the same time ; because it was in terms of them that the hated doctrine was enunciated , and it was their apparently inferior characteristics to which the Materialist tried to reduce the valuable properties of mental life . These sponges are still wet . It will doubtless take many years before in  | philosophy we are all able to look upon the organism and the brain with quiet impartiality , or even with the intense interest which is due to them . Meanwhile their appearance in a philosophical discussion will be resented by many , unless we hasten to give assurances that there will be a happy end ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life will be consolingly demonstrated . But how is one to give such assurance in the face of overpowering evidence to the contrary ? Long before the middle of the last century there had been other waves of Materialistic thinking . The intellectual level of such earlier theories was , in general , not higher than that of Materialism around 18050 . For the reason which I have just indicated , however , the reaction of other philosophers had been no less bitter on those earlier occasions than it was in the i gth century . The aversion to a frank and positive discussion of biological facts in their connection with psychological data has therefore a long history which naturally makes such a dislike even more intense and less rational . But I do not believe that Materialistic doctrines are the only cause of this attitude . Up to the present time , we have seen , most people have failed to distinguish between the body , ' which is a percept , and the organism , which is a transphenomenal entity . In the remote past this distinction could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body-percept was quite generally identified with the organism as a physical object . Such a confusion could not fail to have far-reaching effects ; for unfortunately the body ' will often appear as a burden to those who hold particularly high ideals of ethical conduct or intellectual achievement . At this point we have to introduce a new distinction :  | Although in common life we frequently speak of the ' body ' as ' I , ' words like ' I ' and myself ' have still another meaning in which they refer to a less tangible center of human activities . ' I ' taken in this sense may , for instance , concentrate upon ' my left hand ' or on some other part of my ' body . ' The very words of this sentence prove that , here , I ' and ' my body ' are not the same entity . Whether or not the ' self ' in this new sense is phenomenally localized within the body-percept , it seems at an early date to have been regarded as a different entity and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be done , it chooses between various forms of conduct , it tries to live up to its own demands , it makes efforts to understand where at first a situation lacks clearness . When , upon a resolve of the ' I , ' overt activity is needed , the ' body ' often behaves like a tactful servant , who anticipates a formal order by appropriate activity . It moves at once and with ease . This , however , is by no means always the case . Much of the resistance against the ' self 's ' intentions and commands is definitely localized in the ' body . ' From a phenomenological point of view there has always been sufficient reason why many philosophers and religious leaders should attribute temptation and passion , whatever disturbs superior purposes , not to the ' self ' in this sense , but to the ' body . ' Reasonable planning , moral effort and clear thinking as such are hardly ever felt to concern the ' body ' ; temptation , however , is often enough well localized , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame . Even if the resistance which the ' body ' offers is sometimes more passive , it may still be exasperating enough . There are days when even the strong1 With Professor Claparede I find that , as a rule , it is localized within the ' body , ' even in a definite part of it . Cf. Ed . Claparede , Note sur la localisation du Moi . Arch . de Psychol. 19 ( 1924 ) .  | est effort will not lead to any concentrated and successful thinking . The body ' feels heavy , and so long as it does the philosopher seems almost to drag its inert weight along the path of meditation . Trivial though these observations are , it is for an obvious reason that they are here repeated . For several thousand years they have , with all their implications , been referred to an entity which was body-percept and organism in one . This was true in Plato 's time when that philosopher and certain religious groups regarded the body ' as the prison of the soul ; it was equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movements some centuries after Plato ; and it still applies to those philosophers for whom even at the present time the body ' and the organism are the same thing . Whenever they discuss the relations between mental life and organic events , it is really the body-percept and its behavior which mainly determines the trend of their arguments . The brain , for example , is in such discussions a visual thing which looks none too pleasant ; it also is a slippery thing which we do not like to touch . Slippery ' is a word which here has a phenomenal meaning . It denotes an Ehrenfels-quality in the field of touch . No less a percept , i.e. , a phenomenal entity , is the body ' as a whole . When heaviness ' irritates the thinker it dwells in this percept ; it is its heaviness . ' And it is again this percept in which now and then disturbing urges may be felt . Put in their right places all these experiences lead to fascinating questions about the constitution of the body-percept and about its fluctuating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of these observations is directly relevant to an investigation which aims at an understanding of mental life in its relation to the life of the organism as a transphenomenal , a physical entity . It is ,  | indeed , an essential phenomenological task to examine how the self ' ? in the narrower sense ? and the body ' are related . But it is quite another task to investigate how all phenomena , including the self ' and the body , ' are correlated with processes in the organism . It would probably mean a real progress in philosophical discussion if , along with the distinction between body ' and organism , we could make it a rule that the organism as well as its functional relations with mental life be impartially considered , regardless in principle of such shortcomings as we may find in something else , namely the body-percept . From percepts , it is true , the physicist draws his conclusions about corresponding transphenomenal objects ; and when a patient complains about pain in his body , ' something is usually wrong with the organism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body ' which disturbs the thinker will generally mean an irregularity in organic function . Whenever the organism is out of order the body-percept seems to indicate the trouble readily enough . We also know certain states of bodily ' well-feeling which may be a translation , in phenomenal language , of optimal physical conditions in the organism . But there are other things about which we learn little , if anything , from the body-percept . Successful thinking , energetic resolves , will often absorb the self ' so completely that it almost forgets the existence of the body . ' Forgotten or not , the body ' seems to have no major role in those achievements . For this reason people will naturally conclude that higher mental operations succeed independently of the body . ' The body seems capable of disturbing ; but so far as positive achievements of mental life are concerned it tends to become an indifferent neighbor of the self . ' There is a good phenomenological foundation for this  | view ; for the body ' it may be literally true . Since , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the organism , correct observation will in this case lead to wrong conclusions . Between the body ' and higher mental functions relations are either experienced as unsatisfactory , or they appear as neutral with a minimum of phenomenal reality ; seldom are they intense and satisfactory at the same time . There are , I believe , few phenomenal facts which have influenced philosophical thinking as strongly as has this asymmetrical relationship . For so long as the body ' is identified with the organism , the same asymmetry will , of course , be ascribed to the relations which prevail between the organism and mental processes . There will always be a tendency to charge the organism with any difficulties which we meet during our best mental operations . When we are successful , however , our achievements will be attributed to ourselves ' only . As soon as we realize that the body ' and the organism are two different entities , this simple distribution of merits can no longer be justified . The fact may not show itself in corresponding bodily ' phenomena , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presupposes just as much normal functioning of the brain as certain deviations of thinking are due , for instance , to a paralytic brain . We have no reason whatsoever to assume that the same asymmetrical relation obtains between the various states of the organism and higher mental life as impresses us so much when we consider the role of the body ' during those mental operations . In identifying the body ' with the organism we are necessarily led to a biased view of all facts which concern the psychophysical problem . The less we hear of any influence which the organism may have on higher mental processes , the better we are  | pleased ; because the organism is the body , ' and the body ' is bad . Once , however , the distinction between the body ' and the organism is clearly made , no reason is left for this prejudiced attitude . The organism is precisely as " good " when its processes support our highest mental efforts as it is " bad " when in another case its state does not allow of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It tends to speak only when something can be said against the defendant . Our present situation is this : We know very much more now about the definite connections between mental life and neural activity than any Materialist around 1850 could possibly have foreseen . Philosophy has not tended to take this change into account . It is as though negative arguments , which eighty years ago were good enough to refute Materialistic speculation , were still sufficient in a discussion of present neurological knowledge and of its relation to mental facts . It remains true that " movements of matter " will never " explain " any phenomenal datum . But is there nothing implied by the fact that , whether they are movements of matter or not , neural events show so much intimacy with all phases of mental life ? This , one should think , is a challenging , a most alluring situation for philosophy , which is here confronted by one of the greatest problems of the world . But the organism is still very much the body . ' Thus , while neurologists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in philosophy on the other side we generally find an attitude of somewhat passive disdain or of mere defence . In the meantime those ideas about physical nature which once were dominant among the physicists , and in still cruder form among the Materialists , have been thoroughly and for ever discarded . This is another essential  | change in the situation . The physical world with which neurologists find mental life so intimately connected can no longer be adequately described as " moving matter . " New ideas have gradually replaced such older notions . If now , from a changed point of view , it should become plausible that brain-events have much in common with essential aspects of the phenomenal world , ? what would the consequence be ? Many are likely to say that now at last Materialism has become a danger . The more akin . ' nature is to mental life , the greater the chance for Materialism . I could not share this opinion . Intimacy of mental life and brain-function would disturb me so long as brainfunction must be regarded as foreign to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o I should fail to understand the relationship and , besides , I should regard it as oppressive . If , instead , it were found that in certain major respects the same happens " on the other side " as happens mentally " on this side , " I should certainly feel a great relief . Whatever else the intimate relationship between cortical events and phenomena might mean , it would no longer imply that the course of my mental processes is secretly determined by the principles of an altogether different world . The other view would be the most remarkable example of what I tried to indicate when I mentioned the outstanding characteristic of sponges . If we could show that cortical processes share some of the main structural aspects of phenomenal experience , they would to that extent become equivalent to such phases of the phenomenal realm ; they would therefore be exactly as " good " as are such mental facts ; and thus an attitude of resentment would become simply unreasonable .  | This may be clear . But I wonder whether it will help . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are too well impregnated . In philosophy we seem to dislike their very sound , whatever may be the actual nature of physical reality in general and of cortical processes in particular . The main argument of the last chapter applies directly to biology . If anatomists , physiologists and neurologists have any knowledge of the organism and its functions , this knowledge can only be formulated in terms the ultimate source of which is phenomenal . It follows that between biological facts on the one hand and at least some aspects of the phenomenal world on the other there must be resemblance . It is not only the argument , to be sure , which applies to both the physical and the organic realm , but also its limitations . First of all , the conclusion can not be inverted . Some characteristics of the phenomenal world , for instance the secondary qualities , have no place in physics ; they have no place in biology either . Moreover , if certain processes in the human brain are said to be the cortical correlates of phenomenal colors , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like such colors . According to our present views this holds for all sensory qualities without exception . They all have cortical correlates ; but their own existence seems to be restricted to the phenomenal world . The cortical correlates of mental life or , as we may also call them , the psychophysical processes are more interesting for our purposes than any other biological facts . Requiredness is an aspect of many phenomenal contexts . Like other phenomena such contexts have their cortical cor-  | relates ; requiredness as one of their characteristics ought to be psychophysically represented just as are the contexts in which it occurs . What is this psychophysical representation of requiredness ? ? A priori a psychophysical correlate and its phenomenal partner might have much or very little in common . One possibility , the most radical , is that , where requiredness occurs in an experience , the corresponding cortical correlate has the same characteristic . The present question goes far beyond the problems of the last chapter . All biological facts which the human mind can approach may necessarily have some resemblance to phenomenal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processes . It does not follow that the correlate of a particular experience has the same specific characteristics as has the experience itself . Just as the cortical correlate of the color blue is not blue , so requiredness as an experience may be accompanied by processes which are " mere " facts , and are to that extent devoid of any requiredness whatsoever . Such " mere " facts may have to be described in terms the meaning of which is ultimately phenomenal . Nevertheless requiredness need not belong to the terms which this description would use . Quite apart from requiredness , philosophers assume for the most part that between individual human experiences and their cortical correlates there is no more kinship than is found between the same experiences and , say , the facts of gravitation . One reason for this belief seems to be a certain bias in the choice of those experiences which people compare with brain-events . Our attention is naturally directed toward our ' environment , ' and under the influence of sense-physiology we are inclined to regard the sensory qualities as the principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientist denies expressly  | that these qualities have any existence in nature , brainprocesses included , there seems to be no further question : the properties of cortical correlates differ widely from those of their phenomenal partners . Thus we forget to consider other attributes of experience . What may be granted in the case of sensory qualia need not apply to all aspects of objective phenomena , nor is it necessarily true of mental activities . It might be objected that , because of their elementary nature , the sensory qualities are happily chosen for a first comparison between experience and psychophysical processes . If no resemblance can be found even in this case between phenomena and their cortical partners , what hope remains of discovering such a resemblance in instances of more complicated and distinguished experiences ? ? It seems to me that this objection has no force . It presupposes the customary notion that physical reality , both inanimate and organic , represents a lower form of existence . With this premise the highest achievements of nature might conceivably approximate the most primitive contents of human experience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resemblance between phenomena and their correlates no further investigation seems to be needed . And yet , there might be resemblance between central features of mental life and their psychophysical counterparts even though phenomena on a lower level show no similarity with their cortical correlates . Quite another reason for the same negative attitude is given in the following well-known argument : Even if we knew as much about brain-processes as the astronomer knows about the movements of stars , would such knowledge be of any help in psychology ? It would not . Supposing even that every detail of a person 's cortical activity could  | be observed , should we know what he perceives , feels and thinks at the time of such observation ? We should not . Our observation would deal with data of a foreign world . No psychological interpretation could be given to these data until the man begins to speak and thus to reveal what familiar mental phenomena are accompanied by those strange performances of atoms and molecules in his brain . The general conviction that human experience and psychophysical events have little in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any respect the cortical correlates of mental life were like images of their phenomenal partners , mere description of the first would to some degree be a correct report about the second . It is this possibility which we find emphatically denied in the argument . The argument betrays its own weakness , however , showing clearly , as it does , that it rests on a special premise . If brain-events are said to constitute a " foreign " world in comparison with human experience , there is invariably an allusion to particles and their behavior as being responsible for the foreign character of cortical processes . In other words , it is tacitly assumed that only microscopic events in the cortex can be the correlates of mental life . Behind this assumption there is the other that real truth about any facts of nature is truth in terms of particles and microscopic events . Thus it comes to pass that in comparing phenomena and brain-events we concentrate not only on the wrong phenomena but also on the wrong phase of cortical activity . If all physical reality were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusive . The nature of thing-percepts , we had to admit , could not make anybody suspect that the constitution of physical objects  | is atomic . Neither percepts nor any other phenomena , we may now add , indicate by their properties that the braintissue consists of particles , and that to this extent psychophysical processes are atomic events . Even the existence of discrete neural entities which are incomparably larger than ions and molecules could not be inferred from the nature of phenomenal facts . We learn in brain-anatomy that cortical tissue contains cells , neurons with their axons , cell-bodies and dendrites ; but I do not know of any psychological observation which would hint at the presence of such histological elements in the brain or at the relevance of their function for experience . In the last chapter we have , however , seen that the microscopic consideration of nature is by no means the only admissible approach to physical reality . Macroscopic physics is at present less popular than microscopic physics ; but it will not always remain so . Moreover , the terms " microscopic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a difference between two points of view , one of which comes nearer the truth than the other . Rather the objects of scientific investigation themselves generally have both macroscopic and microscopic properties . Whoever overlooks one of them will therefore miss one side of his subject matter ; and this is just as true of macroscopic facts as it is of microscopic data . In our previous discussion we were mainly concerned with macroscopic physical objects . These we found to represent dynamic organization on a higher level than that of microscopic entities such as , for example , atoms and molecules . For our present purpose it is more essential that the same distinction applies to the processes and states through which physical systems pass . Not only are there two ways , the microscopic and the macroscopic , in which such processes may be considered . The processes  | themselves have frequently both microscopic and macroscopic properties , neither of which are less " real " than the others . We are seldom justified in considering the processes and states of larger systems as though they were mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a higher level of organization , do not permit of such treatment ; they have to be investigated for their own sake and from a macroscopic point of view , because their own nature is macroscopic . A few examples will make it clearer what we mean when we speak about macroscopically organized physical states . The facts as such are extremely simple and familiar ; it is only their general significance which many fail to realize . Suppose that a steady current of water streams through a pipe , that at some point the main pipe divides into a number of branches , and that farther ahead these branches unite again into one pipe , through which the water is led to its final destination . To superficial inspection it might appear as though the behavior of the water in each branch were merely a local affair , independent of any conditions outside this particular pipe . That this appearance is deceptive can , however , be easily discovered , if in each branch there is a device , a key , by which the current in this branch may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As soon as this is done in one or several branches the current will flow faster in those which have not been interfered with . Conversely , as everyone knows from his own experience , if water is given one more outlet from a system of pipes , the current in other parts of the system will stream more slowly. ? The example is trivial ; but even so it contains the principle of macroscopic dynamics . An observer who considers the current in one branch by itself assumes a relatively microscopic attitude . Not even the  | local current in this branch , however , can be fully understood as a , physical fact unless the observer decides to turn his eyes upon a larger context . The branch in question may not exhibit any condition which would produce a gradient of pressure and a current in one direction rather than in the other . If , therefore , the water streams persistently toward one side , it must be conditioned to do so by circumstances outside the branch , i.e. , outside the range of the microscopic observer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the branchcurrents . Whatever happens to one of them alters the pressure and its gradient everywhere in the system , so that the rate of current changes accordingly in all the other branches . It follows that , even in the absence of such interference , the water in any of the pipes will flow steadily and at the observed speed only , if it streams at corresponding rates in the others ? and vice versa . There is only one distribution of current in which such dynamic interdependence throughout the system preserves the steady state of streaming ; and from any initial situation this final distribution develops quickly . It is a self-distribution of current adapted to given outer forces and to the properties of given channels . This distribution is steady only as a macroscopic dynamic context . As the physicist uses the term " microscopic , " it refers to events on a molecular level . In his terminology the current in one branch of the system is a macroscopic part of the total macroscopic distribution . The difference in expression is wholly unimportant for our purpose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior of some molecules somewhere in the current . In this case the discussion would have precisely the same result , although we should discover that irregular thermic vibrations of molecules are superimposed on their flow as it is determined in the larger context .  | Both the molecules and the branch-current behave in a manner which we can not understand , unless we realize the larger functional context within which this behavior is determined . If I have slightly changed the meaning of the term " microscopic , " the new meaning is , I believe , more valuable and significant than the usual connotation . It seems to me less important that microscopic observation is occupied with atomic entities than that it concentrates on events which do not as a rule occur independently . Similar examples in more interesting parts of physics are always handled , at least by the scientist , in a manner which implies full acknowledgement of everything that has just been said . The characteristics of macroscopic dynamic states are , however , seldom formulated in explicit general statements . If they were , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably be clearer than it often is . Again , it could not happen that the same facts , which are simple and almost trivial when we consider a concrete instance , appear strange and slightly disturbing when expressed in general terms . We are not accustomed to these terms . It is the analytical trend of modern science with which the existence of specific macroscopic realities seems to be at odds . And yet there is no objection to an analysis of macroscopic states , provided that we realize what such an analysis can achieve . It can tell us how local events behave within a given macroscopic context , what happens locally as a dependent part of this context or ? this seems to be the best expression ? how the context behaves at its several points . More often , it is true , analysis is expected to give us independent elementary facts , the mere synthesis of which would yield the complex entities found in primary observation . I admit that in this radical sense analysis is not really applicable to macroscopic states ; it is incompatible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not to find , but to select examples , because there are so many . Owing to its technical importance the distribution of an electric current has become a familiar instance . From a battery or another source the current spreads through a network of wires and then returns to the source , the seat of the electromotive force which maintains the electric flow . As soon as the circuit is closed the electrons begin to travel in the wires . Any of these wires is capable of conducting current in many different intensities ; but after a tiny fraction of a second each wire conducts that one particular rate of current which is compatible with a steady and unchanging flow everywhere in the system . Again we have a macroscopic dynamic state the characteristic self-distribution of which maintains itself only as a whole . If we interfere at one point , we disturb this state all over the circuit and its branches . A long time ago Kirchhoff stated the mathematical rules which the self-distribution of current follows . In the form of his equations the same meaning is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terms of common language . I shall not add examples from such domains of physics as electrostatics , magnetization , elasticity , heat-conduction and diffusion . The principle remains essentially the same as in our two instances , whatever the forces and the material which assume a particular macroscopic distribution in each case . It should be realized , however , that the flow of water in a system of pipes and the steady state of electric current in wires agree in one respect which gives both cases a particularly simple character : The channels through which either the currents of water or those of electrons pass are narrow , and they unite only at certain points . This special circumstance makes it an easy task  | of elementary mathematics to calculate what the rate of current must be in each branch when the flow is steady throughout the system . In the general problem of selfdistribution or of macroscopic states such simplifying restrictions are absent . Suppose that a hollow vessel be given with one opening for the entrance and another for the release of water . The vessel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves through the second opening . How will the current be distributed in this stationary state ? For each given shape of the interior and for each position of the openings the " lines of flow " ? as individual lines , of course , mere constructions of mathematical imagination ? will assume a different distribution . Here they will be parallel , there they will converge , there they will bend ; and the speed of flow will vary correspondingly . In this case the flow at every point depends even more directly on the current everywhere else , and vice versa , because the system is no longer divided into a number of discrete narrow branches which are in touch only at certain points . A steady state is again established , with this distinguishing feature , however , that in the continuous volume of current the direction of flow at each point is as much a problem as is its intensity or rate . Self-distribution of electric current may occur under similarly generalized conditions , i.e. , in a continuous volume . Depending on the shape of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current will in each case assume a steady spatial distribution in which again both the local direction and the local intensity of flow are only maintained as dependent parts of the complete macroscopic process . We shall presently return to this case.2 2 For our present purpose we need not discuss the genesis of steady distributions . Such a discussion will , however , he of paramount importance in connection with certain other problems of psychophysics.  | Experimental physics is not particularly interested in the study of such continuous macroscopic states . As the conditions under which self-distribution develops may be varied freely , an infinite number of macroscopic states is possible in each class : the hydrodynamic , the electric , and so on . The investigation of a number of individual cases would add little to our knowledge of basic physical facts . Besides , what could the experimentalist do ? In order to know the distribution of a steady current inside a given volume he would have to measure the rate and the direction of flow at as many points as possible ? a thoroughly tedious occupation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since , at least in many cases , the very attempt to measure local flow will lead to interference with the distribution itself : The approach and the insertion of a measuring device would generally mean the introduction of new conditions to which the macroscopic state can respond only by a change of distribution . Satisfied that no essentially new facts are to be discovered in this field , the physicist will moreover give little time to macroscopic states in his teaching . This is why one can learn a good deal about practical physics without ever hearing very much about this section of science . As a matter of fact , the investigation of self-distribution in continuous media has become a task for mathematicians rather than for physicists . The general rule which macroscopic states must fulfill is easily formulated in mathematical terms . A single differential equation , named after Laplace , will apply to most cases . Unfortunately , however , this equation does not express much more than that in a steady state the forces and the flow at each point should not alter this steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , correspond with this condition in a given case is the ques-  | tion which the mathematician tries to answer . No direct and simple mathematical procedure is available for this purpose . During the i 9th century the invention of solutions even for comparatively simple cases occupied some of the best mathematical minds . The Dirichlet problem and the Neumann problem , formulations of this mathematical task for two slightly different sets of conditions , are noted for their tremendous intrinsic difficulty . In his great treatise on " Electricity and Magnetism " Maxwell has given a most vivid description of the puzzling intellectual situation in which the scientist finds himself when he works in this field . This is not a branch of physics with which other men of science , philosophers and the public will become familiar through popular books . If they did , the belief would not be so general that physics is under all circumstances an " analytical " science in which the properties of more complex extended facts are deduced from the properties of independent local elements . The thesis that analysis , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynamic states is borne out by the predicament of mathematicians who must find the steady distribution as a whole if they are to tell us what the steady flow is in a part of the system . " There is one ideal of survey which would look into each minute compartment of space in turn to see what it may contain and so make what it would regard as a complete inventory of the world . But this misses any world-features which are not located in minute compartments . " 3 I do not know of any physical entities to which these words of Eddington would better apply than they do to dynamic steady states which originate and maintain 3 A. Eddington , The Nature of the Physical World , p. io3.  | themselves in macroscopic self-distribution . As early as 1910 Planck made a similar remark.4 It seems significant that both he and Eddington were led to such observations while discussing the Second Law of Thermodynamics . This principle always deals with questions of self-distribution ; it is besides indispensable to an understanding of the origin of any steady state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the astronomer pointed to those more strictly " dynamic " examples which we have here discussed . If the study of macroscopic steady states as such had ever become an outstanding occupation of physics , the scientific world would now be more clearly conscious of their functional peculiarities . In consequence of it an application of such knowledge to problems of biology might at present be a well established practice . We can not take it for granted that the scale of relative significance in which the physicist ranks his several problems and subjects will always agree with their evaluation for purposes of biology and psychology . For biology and psychology macroscopic dynamic states seem to be of paramount importance.5 . Biologists , it is true , regard it as an obvious fact that , quite apart from special processes in its interior , the organism in its totality represents a steady physical state rather than a macroscopic physical object . Its material is 4 M. Planck , Acht Vorlesungen fiber theoretische Physik ( 1910 ) , pp. 96 f. 5 The reader will find a more general discussion of macroscopic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Ruhe and im stationiiren Zustand 1920 . ( In details , this investigation no longer corresponds to our present knowledge of certain facts in physics and electrophysiology . But its main content is , I believe , still correct. )  | not permanent . It breaks down and is eliminated continually , while new material is absorbed from the outside , is chemically reorganized and distributed approximately in the same pattern and at the same rate . It would be a great help if a clear logic or even merely a clear terminology had been worked out for those elementary cases of self-distribution which physics has to deal with . Gradually such a logic might now grow and differentiate , until it became applicable to more and more complex organic facts . As the situation actually is , we simply feel bewildered by the extreme heterogeneity of this unique macroscopic process , the organism . In the treatment of some particular organic functions we are apparently a trifle better off . What happens in the circulatory system approaches so closely inanimate hydrodynamic models that at least some apposite concepts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , simply be transferred to the behavior of blood and lymph . More recently quite a number of special steady states have been investigated within the organism , and Professor W. B. Cannon 's fascinating summary of this work , to which he himself has so eminently contributed , is widely known.6 As yet , however , the connection of the biological facts in question with general dynamic principles of physics has not been clearly stated . It is perhaps more surprising that in the theory of nervous functions and , more particularly , of processes in ganglionic layers the concept of macroscopic dynamic contexts is so rarely used . Specific order of function in this field has over and over again been explained by a separation of elementary processes from each other rather than by the behavior of coherent macroscopic states . McDougall 's theory of " drainage " may be mentioned as 6 W. B. Cannon , The Wisdom of the Body . ( 1932 ) .  | an exception ; and occasionally another author ventures a slightly heretical statement . Even in Sherrington 's work , 7 however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean either a mosaic of independent local facts or a macroscopic context of function : for reasons which I need not repeat , the alternative does not always seem to be clearly seen . Because of such unclarities as to the very principles of function the more conservative view naturally dominates in the practice of actual scientific work . The properties of brain-tissue as a physical and a chemical medium are such that in this part of the organism macroscopic contexts of function are not merely possible ; it is difficult even to imagine how their occurrence could be prevented . As to the microscopic content of the tissue , which in the physicist 's sense are the ions , electrons , etc. , such entities move in the brain as near to each other as they do in extraorganic solutions of moderate density . An individual particle will therefore hardly ever be outside the " field " of its neighbors . This makes the tissue as such a macroscopically coherent entity through which " field " extends as a continuum , 8 and , if no special devices or unknown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medium will certainly assume the form of continuous macroscopic contexts . Under these circumstances the argument is not conclusive that , because the constitution of brain-matter is atomic and because brain-processes are microscopic events , there can be no resemblance between the cortical correlates of experience and experience itself . Even if in comparison with phenomena the microscopic phase of psy- 7 C. S. Sherrington , The Integrative Action of the Nervous System . ( 1906 ) ? 8 Cf. ch. 5 , pp. 178 f.  | chophysical processes appears as " a foreign world , " can we draw any conclusion as long as experience has not been compared with macroscopic cortical states ? To pass judgments on the possibility of macroscopic states in ganglionic layers is , one might say , not the task of physics , but of physiology and neurology . And from this side many would expect the objection that nerve processes are conducted in elementary structures , the neurons , that the functionally essential part of cortical tissue , too , consists of individual neurons , and that thus psychophysical processes must be composed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field is quite adapted to a new situation which has arisen as a result of more recent discoveries in nerve-physiology . When we wish a current to pass along a conductor we choose conditions in such a manner that the current flows in the interior , in other words , that it passes wholly through the cross-section of the conductor . With a natural anthropomorphism earlier theory held a similar view of nerve-conduction . According to present knowledge , however , the propagation of nerve impulses follows a different principle . A nerve current is a surface-function , more accurately , a function in which the environment of a nerve fiber plays exactly as important a role as does the fiber itself . This follows from the fact that the " nerve impulse " is an electric current which enters the fiber from the environment in one region and returns to the environment in another region nearby , the circuit being completed outside the fiber . Since the current penetrates into the fiber from all sides , and also returns in all directions to the surrounding medium , the fiber is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enveloped by the outer part of the current . Inside and outside it flows for a stretch roughly parallel to the fiber ,  | though , naturally , in opposite directions . Propagation of the impulse means that the current gradually changes its location along the fiber , and correspondingly , of course , in the surrounding medium . We need not discuss the causes which produce the current ? a local alteration of the surface of the fiber seems to be the essential condition ; nor shall we explain why the current migrates from one part of the fiber to the next . What interests us mainly is the fact that , according to a simple rule of physics , there is invariably just as much of the impulse or current outside the nerve fiber as passes through the fiber itself . Now , distances between the fibers of one nerve , the optic nerve for example , are small . If , therefore , at a given level and at a given time , impulses travel along several parallel fibers , the current in one direction will be distributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while in the opposite direction the flow will fill the common continuous medium in which the fibers are embedded . Outside the group of fibers the impulses themselves form in this manner a functional continuum . To this extent it is obviously incorrect to say that nerve activity is always a function of separate conducting elements . We are , however , in the habit of concentrating our attention on the distinct histological entities , i.e. , the fibers of a nerve . Thus we shall be inclined to say that after all the surface of the fiber has to be altered , if a local current , and thereby the impulse , is to be started . Yet from a purely physical point of view it may be doubted whether , so far as function is concerned , the surface in question is more a boundary of the fiber than it is a boundary of the medium around the fiber . To say that , in a nerve , fibers are embedded in a medium is doubtless correct . Yet it is no less correct to say that in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As psychologists would say , the difference of formulation means that in one description the fibers are regarded as " figures " and the medium between them as mere " ground , " while in the other description this relation is inverted . Whether or not the distinction between these two descriptions has any objective significance remains to be seen . In the meantime it would be an unwarranted preference , if we were , as is still our tendency , to regard the current inside the fiber as important and more or less to ignore the current outside . There is in any case no justification for the belief that nerve function is a matter of separate histological elements , and that thus this function itself is split up into correspondingly separate events . The function of ganglionic layers is at present regarded as similar to that of fibers in one essential respect : it , too , seems to be first and foremost " surface " - function . With one difference , however . While no evidence points as yet to the assumption that an impulse which travels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parallel to its own direction , Adrian and his collaborators have found that in ganglionic tissue groups of cells will under certain conditions show clearly interrelated activity . This is true of the retina , and also of cortical layers.9 For such areas , therefore , the notion can no longer be held that each individual cell functions independently . It seems plausible that interdependence of function in active groups of cells is brought about by the fact that function of the cells is function of their common environment at the same time . This assumption is corroborated by more recent investigations of the- manner in which a nerve impulse is transmitted at a synapse from one neuron to 2E . D. Adrian and R. Matthews . Journ . Physiol. 65 ( 1928 ) , pp. 273 if .  | another . Experimental data point to the explanation that when the impulse reaches the end of the first neuron a chemical substance is secreted by the fiber . The second neuron is stimulated when this substance has passed through the minute stretch of common medium between the first and the second.10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neurons ends and a new set of cells begins , there is , according to this new discovery , a thin sheet of chemical activity in the common medium . If several neurons of the first set are activated side by side simultaneously , this sheet will extend through the ganglionic area as a continuum ; and if impulses follow each other in rapid succession , their individual chemical effects will overlap in time , so that , by summation , a steady chemical state is attained . The particular nature of this state depends on the number of impulses which through one neuron arrive in a unit of time , and on the number o.f active neurons the mingled end-branches of which feed a common synaptic region . There is , indeed , nothing in this situation which would make it a plausible assumption that cortical processes consist of independent events in individual cells . In the following paragraphs psychophysical correlates will , therefore , be considered from a macroscopic point of view . When light stimulates the retina , impulses travel first along the optic nerve and then along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cortex some property of the impulses in question doubtless represents the kind of retinal process ( and therefore of light ) by which the impulses have been caused . When we realize how many 10G . H. Parker , The Origin , Plan and Operational Modes of the Nervous System . 1934 . W. B. Cannon and A. Rosenblueth , Autonomic Neuro-Effector Systems . 1937.  | different qualities of color occur in normal vision we are led to believe that among all known classes of physical events only chemical reactions occur in a corresponding variety of nuances . Since the correlates of color must be variable in just as many dimensions as are the colors themselves , we shall therefore assume that chemical reactions are the psychophysical processes which underlie the various qualities of color . These reactions , we suppose , are produced when impulses of optic fibers reach the striate area . " Take the very simple case in which the visual quality in question is a grey which fills the visual field uniformly . The cortical correlate of this grey will be a particular chemical reaction which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuous state.12-A more interesting situation arises if peripheral stimulation is inhomogeneous . Suppose that a simple white figure , a circle or a square , is projected upon one part of the retina , while around this figure stimulation corresponds to grey as before . When nerve impulses arrive in the cortex both from the figure and from its environment two different chemical processes will be produced , one as the correlate of white and the other as that of grey . The first will occupy a circumscribed region , and the second will extend around the first through the rest of the cortical field . Between the two there will be functional contact along their common boundary . The tissue is an electrolyte ; among the components which take part in the chemical reactions there will be ions . Moreover , a given chemical process will be characterized by a particular concentration of participating ions which re11 Cf. p. 212 , this chapter . 12 The visual cortex contains several layers . We need not decide in which of these layers the reactions may actually occur .  | mains constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives us the following situation : Outside the common boundary of figure and environment there is one concentration of reacting ions , and inside it a different second concentration.13 Any such difference in the ionic constitution of the two regions leads at once to electric events . The area of the figure assumes as a whole one electrostatic potential , and the environment another . Along their common boundary the potential jumps from one value to the other , and the amount of this abrupt gradient is determined by the difference of ionic concentration inside and outside the contour . It would lead us too far into technical discussions if I were to try to explain why differences of chemical constitution are , as a rule , associated with such electric facts . Nernst has given the explanation in terms of ionic diffusion at the common boundary . His theory has been generally accepted in physical chemistry . A difference of potential is an electromotive force . Thus , if certain further conditions are fulfilled , a current will flow through both the figure and its environment.14 Its distribution , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will penetrate the circumscribed area of the figure , it will then spread widely through the homogeneous environment , and will eventually return to the figure . In this manner the figure will be surrounded by a " halo " of current which by its characteristic distribution represents the figure outside its own limited area . I am inclined 13 Instead of a difference in concentration it might also ? but not very plausibly ? be assumed that on both sides of the boundary ions are qualitatively different . The conclusion which we have to draw does not depend upon this alternative . 14 The electromotive force at the boundary of two solutions is unable to produce a current unless the two solutions are in contact with a third medium so that further electromotive forces are added to the first . In cortical tissue this condition will practically always be fulfilled .  | to believe that in any further development of psychophysical theory such currents will play an essential role . At present many physiologists and psychologists are busy studying waves of electric activity which the human brain yields continually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are phases of psychophysical processes , for instance , in the striate area . There is a suspicion that at least some of these waves accompany vegetative processes rather than mental events . Perhaps more attention ought to be given to steady currents . For psychophysical function proper such currents might be just as important as are those interesting waves . IV Practically any part of human experience might be taken as an example of the fact that molecular events in the brain do not as such show much resemblance with phenomena . The visual field , for instance , is a continuum . Displacements of particles , on the other hand , may from a merely microscopic point of view appear as a mass of incoherent events . The visual field , however , is seldom a uniform continuum . Although coherent throughout , it exhibits individual units such as patches , figures , thingpercepts , which are to some degree detached from each other or from a general background . For this aspect of vision again no analogue is found in a strictly microscopic exploration of cortical events . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single particles or perhaps the interaction of a few ; but it could not find any larger entities which , within a widespread field , would constitute specific units of state or process . The situation is not changed if instead of molecular events " the processes  | inside single cells " are considered as the correlates of visual experience . So long as we suppose that such processes are independent single events , any pattern in which they may occur is a mere mosaic . Nothing in this mosaic corresponds with the continuity of the visual field , or with the segregation of such specific entities as figures and things . Macroscopic physical states , however , are continua . Any macroscopic physical object , we have seen , coheres because its particles are " in the field " of their neighbors . Chemical reactions which occur in a macroscopic volume are coherent throughout for the same reason . If , therefore , the correlate of a uniform grey field of vision is a uniform chemical reaction extending through the visual cortex , cohesion or continuity is a characteristic both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But now let a white figure be shown , which visually appears as a segregated part of the field . At once the cortical continuum is thoroughly altered . The area which corresponds to the figure becomes one unit of electrostatic behavior and the environment another . It is not as though functional cohesion throughout the visual cortex were destroyed . On the contrary , it is precisely functional interrelation which leads immediately to electric displacements inside and outside the figure , and thus to the segregation of two areas which maintain each other at different potentials . Using the terminology of earlier paragraphs we may therefore say that segregation occurs as a case of selfdistribution of electrostatic potential.15 This segregation 15 Those who regard " potential " as a mere construct of mathematical physics with no genuine counterpart in physical reality , may describe the same facts in terms of surface-charges and their fields which appear when in one region the chemical state differs from that in another region . No relevant aspect of the situation would be changed by this procedure . In terms of electric potential the description @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area from the rest of the cortical field corresponds with the fact that phenomenally the figure is seen as one thing by itself . If , instead of a white figure , a solid object of the same color interrupts the uniform field , the three-dimensional appearance of the thing-percept offers a new problem in psychophysics . Apart from this the situation is not essentially altered : Again there is in a circumscribed region of the cortex one chemical reaction , and around it there is another . Segregation of one macroscopic unit from its environment will be the consequence . Whatever the correlate of visual depth may be , the psychophysical context shows once more a pattern which in a basic point agrees with that of associated experience . No patch , figure or thing seems ever to appear as a visual unit by itself unless there is at least some boundary at which the visual quality changes . An abrupt slope of potential in the cortex , a functional boundary , is thus a characteristic which accompanies all segregation of visual objects . Although we fully realize how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formulate it as a rule that segregation of particular macroscopic entities within a larger continuum is a common trait of visual experience and of its cortical counterpart . Continuity is a structural trait of the visual field . It is also a structural fact that in this field circumscribed particular percepts are segregated as patches , figures and things . In both characteristics , we have found , the macroscopic aspect of cortical processes resembles visual experience . To this extent , therefore , vision and its cortical correlate are isomorphic . In the last chapter the same term has been used . There , however , it applied to the relation between visual organization on the one hand and the mac-  | roscopic structure of situations in physical space on the other . The fact which mediates between the physical and the perceptual structure is now found to be cortical organization , which , as a rule , resembles both . Eddington 's elephant , for example , is a macroscopic object , a separate entity in physical space . If an image of the animal is projected upon my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain are immediately segregated as a particular macroscopic unit , which is my " psychophysical elephant " ; and one phenomenal thing , the elephantpercept , appears in my visual field . Three people walk before me on the physical street as distinct physical entities ; correspondingly there are three psychophysical units in my cortex and three people-percepts in my visual space . Physically my own organism is a macroscopic object ; I also see it as something apart , namely the visual self ; and in my visual cortex its correlate occupies a region in which , as a macroscopic state , it is set apart from the general psychophysical context. ? Where perceptual organization does not agree with facts in physical space , cortical organization seems to agree with perception rather than with physics . When two objects , seen at night and at a distance , occasionally melt into one strange visual bulk , stimulation has as a rule not been different enough at their common boundary , and in the visual cortex one large unit has been established which is the correlate of my strange percept . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isomorphism between the visual field and its psychophysical correlate . It is not necessary , however , to investigate at present just how far such isomorphism actually extends . Once such structural resemblance is proved to be possible to any extent whatsoever , we can no longer  | maintain that knowledge of cortical events will never reveal data of psychological interest . Supposing that observation were adequately directed toward the macroscopic characteristics of psychophysical processes in a visual cortex , the description of these processes in macroscopic terms would be a correct report , not only of the cortical situation , but also of some essential traits of the visual field to which the psychophysical situation corresponds . Not for a moment should we forget , however , that isomorphism , thus considered , is a relation between visual experience and dynamic realities . The distribution of processes in the visual cortex has once before been discussed in these chapters . ' But the description that was then given referred to the merely geometrical aspect which the pattern of cortical events exhibits . I wanted to show that localization of thing-percepts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just as in visual space thing-percepts are localized outside the body-percept , so processes corresponding to things are , in the visual cortex , localized outside the processes which correspond to the visible self . So far as it went , this description was correct . And yet it was not quite adequate . From a merely anatomical and geometrical point of view we were not really entitled to speak of specific processes which correspond with things or with the visible self . Connection between the retina and the cortex , as it was then presented , preserves a merely geometrical order of points ; but it does not provide for any organization . There is nothing in this scheme which could explain , why things or why the body are segregated entities in the visual field . Although it gives an orderly mosaic of local brain-events , it does not lead us to expect either a continuum of coherent function , which 16 Cf. ch. 4 , pp. 134-140.  | extends through the visual cortex as a whole , or the fact that , within certain areas , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things and to the self . In this respect the situation has been greatly changed by the discussion of the last paragraphs . In the description to which I have just referred there was , however , one more term that needs a certain correction . Thing-processes , we said , occur outside the bodyprocess . What does " outside " mean in this sentence ? As a matter of fact , the correlate of a thing-percept and that of the body-percept will quite generally have different locations in the visual cortex . But , if we wish to think consistently , we can not contend that this geometrical fact has as such any psychophysical significance . Rather such terms as " being outside " have to be given a functional interpretation , just as has been done with the terms " continuous " and " segregated . " In assigning isomorphic correlates to the various structural properties of visual space we can not in one case point to functional realities and in another case to mere geometrical relations . Geometrically one thing will be said to be " inside " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boundary of the first enters or passes the second . In a continuum of function a particular region is functionally " inside " another , if any functional influence which is exerted by the first alters the second before it has any more remote effects . Conversely , one area is functionally altogether " outside " a second area , if interaction between the first and the second is mediated by alterations in a third area . Here I have omitted the special case of direct neighborhood . Obviously two areas are functionally " immediate neighbors " of each other , if an influence which one exerts upon the other need not pass through and alter any third  | region ; in other words , if those areas are somewhere in direct functional contact . In most or all cases , it is true , in which these functional definitions are applicable the corresponding geometrical relationships will also obtain . Such is the connection between continuity of physical function and the properties of physical space . And yet the two kinds of definitions point toward two actually different sets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , completely disappear from a medium , while corresponding geometrical relations would remain entirely unaltered . Besides we need only take one more step in order to see that discrepancies between the geometrical and the functional definition of a relation are by no means impossible . The functional meaning of the term " between " may serve as an example . A point X lies functionally between two other points A and B , if the most direct functional influence which A can exert on B ( or B on A ) will alter X first and only then B ( or A ) . Suppose now that in some region of the brain one part of the cortex protrudes into the recess formed by another part of the cortex ( Cf. fig. i ) . If A and B are two points of the cortex in which we are interested , what points  | are functionally or psychophysically " between " A and B ? Geometrically the protruding part of the cortex and more particularly the points x and y are in this position . But an a influence which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ y , which lie perhaps at an enormous functional distance both from A and B. On the other hand X and Y are likely to be altered by a change in A , before , precisely by this alteration , the change of A has any influence on B. Thus X and Y rather than x and y are " between " A and B in the only sense in which this term should be applied to psychophysical processes . In this manner , not in a geometrical interpretation , are relationships within the cortical continuum assumed to be isomorphic with the structural properties of visual space . More especially thing-percepts are seen completely outside the body-percept whenever other visual processes intervene between the correlates of those things and the correlate of the visual self . A thing-percept touches the visual self , when at least at one point functional contact is direct between the cortical counterpart of the thing and that of the self . The discussion of relative cortical localization which I have given in the fourth chapter seems to me acceptable only if it is thus understood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between , " " in contact with , " " at a distance from " are relationships which the mathematicians call topological . From other spatial relations they are distinguished by the fact that in a given case they may remain invariant , while the metrical properties of the medium in question are radically changed . Visual space has certain metrical traits , and metrical relations obtain to some extent between its parts . It is not necessary for our main purpose that the psychophysical counterparts of these relations be here considered . It needs hardly to be  | mentioned , however , that a more complete theory of psychophysical space would have to contain definite prescriptions according to which distances and other quantitative phases of extension are to be measured in terms of cortical function . I doubt very much whether psychophysical distances in a functional sense of the word are proportional to geometrical distances in brain-tissue ; nor should I assume that the functional distance between two given points in cortical tissue has once for all a constant value . A great difficulty for any psychophysical theory of visual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area as a whole consists of two parts , one of which belongs to the right and the other to the left hemisphere . Since between these parts there is a functional connection through the corpus callosum , the existence of a theoretical difficulty can neither be maintained nor denied until the metrical properties of psychophysical space are functionally defined . I have sometimes heard it said that the theory of psychophysical isomorphism is a verbal rather than a substantial achievement . It is easy , thus some seem to feel , to abstract from psychological facts their structural characteristics , and then to describe such psychological structures twice : first in psychological terms , then once more in a language which has a more physiological sound . It is obviously the import of this criticism that the theory does not really contain statements about both physical facts and psychological data ; that actually there is only one single set of factual statements which by the use of two different sets of expressions assumes a dual appearance .  | In answering this objection we should be clear about its meaning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the psychophysical correlates of phenomenal data ; rather , it is maintained that actually there are no such assumptions at all. ? I can not accept this criticism . It seems to ignore the fact that the main terms of physiological and physical science have meanings which were established long before there was any theory of psychophysical isomorphism . For a long time it was regarded as an obvious fact that no statement formulated in such terms could ever be analogous to the statements in which psychologists describe the structure of phenomena . The theory of psychophysical isomorphism produces statements such as used to be considered impossible . And it is not a trick of language by which this is achieved . To be sure , expressions do appear in the theory which have not hitherto been used in discussions of cortical events . Instead of being only a matter of language , however , this emergence of new terms indicates that certain phases of physical nature which have been overlooked in earlier discussions are now believed to participate in psychophysical function . What in fact could be meant by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and psychological facts might , somehow , be " the same thing " ? Practically nothing , so long as in concreto the data of these two realms appeared as utterly different . Even the thesis of isomorphism , which is a much more definite proposition , is not yet a theory , but remains a postulate , until we are enabled to point toward modes of physical function that have a genuine structure . It is not merely a new expression : the contention that macroscopic physical states rather than microscopic events are the correlates of phenomenal contexts is a positive hypothesis .  | Such macroscopic states do have specific structures . And if we try to show that such states may plausibly be assumed to occur in cortical tissue , we are again not dealing with mere expressions ; we are discussing physiological facts which may or may not agree with our physical assumption . It will give us a better view of the situation if one more remark is added . Isomorphism is a postulate . It becomes a theory by virtue not of one hypothesis , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one such assumption that a cortical correlate of visual continuity is indicated ; a second hypothesis refers to the correlate of visual segregation , a third to the isomorphic representation of topological relations in visual space ; a fourth will be needed in the case of metrical relations , a fifth for the third dimension of space , and so on for all discernible structural characteristics of the phenomenal world . On the other hand , our freedom in introducing such hypotheses is greatly restricted . Not only must they agree with available physical and physiological evidence ; they must also be mutually compatible . The principle by which isomorphism as to segregation is explained has to be in harmony with that by which cortical function is made a continuum . In the case of metrical spatial relations no hypothesis will be acceptable which is at odds with the explanation of topological isomorphism . Again , whoever tries to offer an isomorphic correlate of visual depth may find that only few possibilities are left for this endeavor ; because the previous assumptions set so many conditions with which this further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this point of the procedure not even one possibility of any further move will be left . In this case the theory of isomorphism would have reached the limits of its applicability . I do not believe that this  | will really happen . But that it could happen shows once more clearly how little a matter of mere expressions the theory actually is . One more step in isomorphic theory will lead us back to our main issue . According to phenomenological analysis requiredness occurs within contexts as a special form of reference or relation between their parts . As yet we have been dealing with only such relationships as are independent of any concrete properties which their objects or terms may possess . In the next paragraphs other relations will be discussed which obtain between the terms inasmuch as these objects have definite characteristics . Requiredness belongs to this class as its probably most interesting special case . If , therefore , it should be unthinkable in principle that any such relations have , as experiences , isomorphic correlates in cortical function , the same would be true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this further problem in the theory of isomorphism . Natural caution makes it advisable to exclude at first the case of requiredness itself and to investigate more elementary relations of this class . A relation , I once read , may be called a " product " of the items or terms of which it is predicated . This particular product , however , has properties by which it differs greatly from other things to which we give the same name . Hydrochloric acid is the product of chlorine and hydrogen . When the product is formed these substances disappear , and we get instead another chemical substance , i.e. , an entity of the same general class . Or take a slightly different example : two animals of opposite sex mate . The offspring may be called their product ; it would be more correct , however , to say that the young are products of male and female germ-cells . In this case again the producing components  | disappear in the product , and the product belongs to the same general class as do the components . If this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the production of relations in experience has little in common with physical production : The terms do not disappear when they " produce " the relation ; and the relation , their product , is not an entity of the same class . In a way , it is true , the terms " unite " when their relation is experienced . Still they remain two distinct data . The relation itself , on the other hand , may be a " product " of the terms ; but it belongs to another class , as shown most clearly by the fact that it has no proper life of its own . If we separate the terms , we do not cut their relation ; we simply make it vanish altogether . Has ever anything like this been found in nature ? So far the argument . In psychology aspects of experience which have such characteristics are well known as Ehrenfels-qualities . Von Ehrenfels himself pointed out that relations satisfy the criteria by which his " Gestaltqualitaten " can be recognized . I hesitate to concede that no situation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an example which I take from the field of perception . When looking at two parallel lines of slightly different length we find that the appearance of the pair tells us directly : the line to the right is longer ( Cf. fig. 2 ) . Where do we see that ? In the present case we see it at the upper and the lower ends of the lines . When we compare these lines , they are not actually seen as two altogether separate things , but rather as the left and the right edges of the area between them . Where the lines end the area also ends , although it has no distinct edges here . The area converges to the left and diverges to the right . In other words , there are slopes from the ends of one line  | to the corresponding ends of the other . This , however , is equivalent to saying that the line to the right is longer . The first two expressions seem to come nearer the actual phenomenological foundation of our judgment ; the last formulation , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those objects in which we are interested , namely , in the present case , the lines . All three statements point to the same essential fact , although they describe it from slightly different points of view . Figure The slopes between the ends of the lines are Ehrenfelsqualities of the pair which originates as a perceptual unit when the lines are brought together . Divergence or convergence does not belong to the same class of perceptual facts as do lines or lengths of lines . Moreover , in the unit which they form the lines do of course not disappear . Lastly , the slopes between their ends have no independent existence ; if the lines are separated no slopes are left , and no divergence or convergence . Thus our description of a very simple instance contains all the characteristics which have been regarded as peculiar to perceived relations . A slope , however , is a particular case of a " gradient , "  | and gradients do not occur only as aspects of perceptual or other phenomenal situations . Physical situations exhibit gradients so regularly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physics than it is in psychology . Improving on an earlier theory which I had proposed some time ago Dr. von Lauenstein has therefore pointed out that gradients in psychophysical contexts might be the correlates of such perceptual relations as the one which we have just discussed.17 What is meant by a gradient in physics ? Examples will tell us more than formal definitions . Between two objects of different electrostatic potential a " field " - gradient and , under certain conditions , a corresponding current develop . Between two objects of different temperature a temperature-gradient and a heat-current are established . In both cases the differences between two physical states are , one might say , realized or functionalized by specific events which come into existence between them . In von Lauenstein 's theory it is plausibly assumed that when two phenomenal data differ in some respect their cortical correlates are also different physical states . In a medium like brain tissue , however , two simultaneous psychophysical processes are not functionally separate events . Thus a gradient may be established between them which owes its origin to the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these processes and of their difference there will be gradients of different kinds , which in this theory are held to be the correlates of all those various relations found in perceptual fields.18 Comparison between perceptual relations and physical 17 O. Lauenstein , Ansatz zu einer physiologischen Theorie des Vergleichs and der Zeitfehler , Psychol . Forsch. 17 ( 1932 ) , pp. 130 if . 18 In the next chapter it will be explained how by the same hypothesis successive relations are interpreted .  | gradients reveals that both have the same structural nature . A gradient may be said to be a " product " of the different physical states between which it develops . In this product the states themselves do not disappear . In a way they are united by the gradient , they become members of a larger functional context ; but they remain two distinct data . The gradient on the other hand does not belong to the same class of entities as the states between which it originates ; a current for instance is not an object nor a potential nor a temperature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the states or objects are separated between which a gradient has been established , it vanishes altogether . It seems safe to conclude that there are situations in nature which exhibit in the form of gradients the same structural aspects as do relations in perception . Gradients are therefore isomorphic with such relations . If an observer of macroscopic brain-events should mention in his report that between two different states he found a gradient depending upon their difference , he would thereby mention a structural trait of the situation which a relation in the phenomenal field and the correlate of this relation have in common . In applying this notion to psychophysical problems we need not at once specify just what gradients may be the correlates of various relations . Without any such assumptions we are in a position to derive from our hypothesis one consequence which may at once be tested . Whatever other properties a gradient may have , the term has its accepted meaning only so long as by a gradient we understand a physical observable that " falls off " through space from one thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any gradient between two given objects or states must depend not only upon the actual difference between their proper-  | ties , but also upon their distance from each other . An increase of this distance , for instance , would make the gradient less steep . Take the example of the two parallel lines . If their length is slightly different the area which they include is convergent or divergent , i.e. , it is a trapezoid , only when their distance is short . With increasing distance the slopes which lead from the ends of one line to the ends of the other , will gradually become less conspicuous , and eventually the observer will be unable to perceive them . Phenomenally the area will then be a rectangle , an oblong . Consequently , an objective difference of the lines which was just noticeable at a shorter distance will become imperceptible at a certain larger distance . Only by increasing the objective difference between the two lengths could noticeable slopes be reestablished under these conditions . The just noticeable difference is therefore , in this case , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , von Lauenstein 's hypothesis is correct the same conclusion should apply quite generally . Being the phenomenal counterparts of gradients , all such perceptual relations should in the range of liminal differences depend on the distances between their terms . In this manner the assumption could be tested experimentally . As yet data are available for only one particular relation , namely , that of comparative brightness . Under the guidance of Dr. Metzger , Miss Jacobs measured the just noticeable difference of brightness between two surfaces which were exposed at varying distances from each other.19 The experimental procedure was this : The subject fix19 M. Jacobs , Ueber den Einfluss des phdnomenalen Abstandes auf die Unterschiedsschwelle fur Helligkeiten . Psychol .

The just noticeable difference was determined for three distances between the objects . About technical details Miss Jacobs ' paper should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects were chosen that their images were projected upon retinal points of equal sensitivity . For a group of ten observers the average noticeable differences were , for the distances of 0 8o 200 cros 11.1 23.5 45.2 , and , in a second experiment with a slightly different procedure , 10.9 23.5 45.3.20 This result agrees completely with the conclusion which we have drawn from the hypothesis , that a gradient is the psychophysical correlate of brightness-difference as a perceptual datum . With increasing distance between the terms the just noticeable difference grows considerably. ? The experiments have been repeated several times and by several students . Under the simple conditions just referred to their outcome has always been the same . In applying the gradient theory to the present case it has been assumed that , if other circumstances are constant , the distance between two cortical processes will be the greater , the farther apart the retinal images are with which those processes correspond . Under the experimental conditions which yielded the data of these experiments , this seems to be a safe assumption . 20 All thresholds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reliability of the differences found by Miss Jacobs is discussed in her paper .  | COMMON language uses the term memory in a specific and narrow meaning . To speak of memory seems natural only when we are occupied with the past . " I am sure I posted your letter , " " I still remember Professor Stumpf 's seminars " ? in such statements we refer to facts of memory . It does not seem right to apply the same word to daydreaming , to other facts of imagination and to dreaming during sleep . Parts of our past , it is true , may as such be revived in these situations , but they are revived more or less incidentally , and there is no intention to copy what has actually happened in previous life . Nevertheless it is obvious that most of the " material " which appears in such processes could never be dreamt or imagined , unless experiences of a similar kind in principle had occurred in our past . Although the content of dreams and imaginations may not be localized in the past , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie far back in time . In psychology we have no adequate term for this influence of the past which is akin to memory , although it is not memory in the usual sense . The whole field of this science , however , is pervaded by facts of which the same may be said . When operating with concepts , as we do in science , or when thinking about the present economic situation in this country , we are not directed 233  | toward the past ; and yet practically all the constructs and notions with which we are occupied during such activities are at our disposal only as gifts of the past . The meanings of words which we read have no particular temporal location , unless it be that given by their present context ; but if in the past we had not learnt the language in question the same words would be unintelligible . In the same manner we speak and we write fluently , for the most part without any reference to the origin of these achievements which , as such , is a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the term " habits " ; but this word , too , has too narrow a connotation for our purpose . Who would call it a habit that I can operate with such concepts as " relation " or " entropy " ? Besides , not only are countless activities automatic now , because they have been shaped in earlier times ; but the same holds for what one might call a secondary organization of perceptual fields . I do not usually think of the past when I walk through New York City , say , from Grand Central Station to some other well-known building ; but it is nevertheless experiences of the past which make me turn here to thF left , there to the right , because just these streets stand out as " the right way . " That it is awkward to speak of memory in all such cases has been observed by several authors . On the other hand , it can not be denied that there is one point which these facts have in common with memory in the usual sense : the participation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With this point the following discussion will be mainly concerned . What has happened in our past life could hardly codetermine our present activities unless to some extent the past were preserved far beyond the time of its occurrence .  | We clearly mean this when we say that events of the past become conditions of present mental processes . Much time may pass between an original experience and the moment in which there is unmistakable evidence of its delayed effect . Some authors seem to think that we need not assume any entity which survives during the interval as a representative of that previous experience , and which becomes effective when present circumstances are favorable . They ought to realize what this view implies : a first event would influence a second , even though between the two there is an empty period , no connection and no continuity , sometimes for hours and days , occasionally for years . I should hesitate to adopt this notion which is so strikingly at odds with all our fundamental ideas of functional interdependence or causation . Other psychologists do admit that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not influence what happens now . They add , however , that the remnant which satisfies their need for continuity is a mental entity , that it belongs to the same general class as actual experience . I must confess ? and here I differ widely from many philosophers and psychologists ? that I find it difficult to grasp the meaning of this assumption . I know the world of experience , of phenomena ; I admit the existence of a second world , the world of nature . But I fail to see what entities there may be which are said to belong to the former of these worlds , while at the same time they are never there . The remnants of past experience never do occur as such in actual experience ; they do not really belong to the phenomenal world , so much is certain . Under these circumstances , what positive meaning is implied in the statement that they are mental entities ? It is expressly denied that they are parts of the physical world . Do we know of a third world , the  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
