For a student generation to which thumbs have more to do than pull out plums , six-foot , 20-year-old Stanley Fiese of Beloit ( Wis. ) was last week putting his 185 lb. of brain and brawn behind a helpful idea-Registered Collegiate Thumbers . A student at St. Ambrose College in Davenport ( Iowa ) , he got the idea last May , thumbed his way around during the summer to enlist boys in several colleges . <P> When St. Ambrose opened this fall he had distributed 25 charters covering more than 500 members . For a 50 fee members receive an authorized R. C. T. emblem as a visible roadside high-sign , and a certified identification card bearing on the reverse a legal waiver releasing any motorist kind enough to offer a lift from liability in case of accident . Encouraged by the Roman Catholic faculty at St. Ambrose , Thumber Fiese plans to enlist 800 more colleges . Says he : " We believe our fundamental idea is sound and . . . that our organization will benefit society . ... I have a girl friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reason I thought of this plan , but the R. C. T. emblem sure helps get a hitch. "
