txt The world 's speed king , Capt . George E. T. Eyston of England , feels that at almost 360 miles an hour he virtually has reached the ceiling of speed on land . His chief rival , John Cobb , also of London , holds however that there is no limit to the rate of motion man can attain on the ground , Captain Eyston , yesterday was timed at 347,16 miles an hour as he rocketed his Thunderbolt automobile through the measured mile on the Bonneville Salt Flats Just east of here , Ho admitted today dash-board instrument &; showed ho hit very close to 300 on the return run . through the mile when failure of an electric-eye timing ' MMus nullified his certain new record .

" Man wo n't go much faster than 360 on land , " he said . Countered Mr. Cobb : " If you can get tires the : , will hold up , if mechanical engineering continues its remarkable development , and If you can get long enough straightaway courses , I do n't think there 's any limit to the speed man could travel , " Mr. Cobb , who is awaiting use of the salt flats for a record attempt in his turtle-shaped Raliton car , anti Sir Malcolm Campbell of England are the only other men who have driven a car faster than 300 miles all hour . ?
