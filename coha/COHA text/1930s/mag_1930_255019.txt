PAY DAY-Nathan Asch-Payson &; Clarke ( $2.50 ) . <P> Jim was the kind of Manhattan clerk you see in the subway-talking loud and big , ogling flappers , staring down anyone who dared to meet his eye . This story tells how he spent a day , a night . As Jim is a perfect type , except for being a little more galvanically lively than the ordinary , his is a story that tells much about Manhattan , about the hundreds of thousands of Manhattanites he represents . He works because he has to , in order to have fun-also because he has to . His fun may seem cheap to you ; it was expensive to him . One night cost him most of a week 's pay ; taking a lunch-counter waitress to the cinema , then a round of speakeasies , taxis , dancing , drunkenness , a fight ; home again in the subway to catch two hours ' sleep before the office ; his mother 's light still on . <P> Mr. Asch has crammed a lot into this staccato , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strident , cacophonous , blaring . Pay Day has this advantage over the newsreel any Manhattanite , any urbanite , performs in every day ; it has been edited , cut , captioned by an author-cinemartist . The result is a good movie . <P> Author Nathan Asch , 28 , was born in Poland , came to the U. S. when he was 13 , went to school , college , worked in Wall St. , became an author at 23 . Other books : The Office , Love in Chartres .
