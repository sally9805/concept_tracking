THE WHITE CABIN A STORY BY LEONARD HESS T T IS enough to say of myself that I had the habit of hanging about the river fronts and that that is how I came to meet Captain Howard Chandis . I found him in one of those stores which sell general merchandise to sailors . The store , facing the East River , was in a red-brick , slope-roofed , three-story house , one of a row of relics , with the shining , quite ethereal new pinnacles of Wall Street aspiring beyond . The place was run by an aunt and her niece , neither of whom objected to my lounging on the premises if I bought an occasional handful of stogies . The flavor of the store repaid me . I am a land person , and here the odors of the sea came to me , brought in by the men from boats  --  smells of brine and tar and cargoes  --  and the odors of romance . Actually I doubt if there was much romance thereabouts , save in Captain Chandis . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as 1 know , of the knights errant of the sea . His ship belonged to no company . She was a tramp-freighter , and he had bought her with " an unexpected inheritance " so he might sail her where he chose . He had taken to ships when he was nineteen . For some reason he called himself " The Eastern and Western Trading Company . " I believe his first mate , a whiskered ancient by the name of Dellops , was the " cow-pany . " The Clelia , a rover , an anachronism , a wallowing , spume-whitened hull , stuck her nose into every port of the seven seas at which men call and into many , I 'm sure , where most never call . Her voyages were as good as timeless  --  two years , three years , four years  --  and not more dependent upon seasons , winds , and tides than upon the vagaries of her commander . Chandis was a massive man of fair complexion . In Mrs. Harrow 's store that morning he looked keenly on , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coaster bought a shirt . Mrs. Harrow 's niece , Alice Foster , waited on the second mate 's pleasure , which seemed difficult to satisfy . The girl had to display an abundant and varied assortment on the mahogany counter . The second mate fingered and squinted at it all and turned over and considered and pushed aside and picked up again  --  a tedious process which Alice Foster endured with a patience I thought little less than divine . Her face suggested a wondrous patience anyway . This was the beginning of my acquaintance with Captain Chandis . Two or three days later he invited me on board his vessel . There must have been a kinship of feeling between us . I , too , am a romantic , and the captain sniffed that at once . On my second visit to the Clelia I found the white cabin . It was one of the most amazing experiences I have ever had , finding that white cabin tucked away in that old , grim tramp-freighter . I had watched the stevedores hoisting bales of silks , canisters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grapefruits , bales of asbestos , boxes of spices , and all sorts of odds and ends out of the dark hold , and then I ambled over the boat as I pleased . The Captain had gone ashore to bargain with merchants over his freight . I lost myself in the vessel but found nothing you could not find on any such vessel until I came to an open door in the corridor amidships . All the other woodwork was brown , but this door was white . That pulled up your attention . What I saw within staggered me . I said to myself , " This is unbelievable ! This is fantastic ! " There was a choking smell of fresh paint . After a three-year , grime-infiltrated voyage the cabin had been made to gleam again , and was being Left to dry out . I saw a bed on which chastity might have lain , a dresser with an oval , enamel-garlanded mirror , a bureau and a wardrobe . Everything was dainty and white and in excellent taste . Two or three chairs , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the shape of a dove with spread wings was gilt , and at the porthole hung rose draperies . On the dresser stood an ivory clock , clamped down , its hands stopped at some hour of a past day . There were a dozen evidences of astounding thought for comfort ; a small but completely equipped bathroom , for instance , sparkling with polished nickel fittings . That cabin , in the midst of that ship , suggested utter fragility . Obviously , it was not the quarters of some officer 's wife . It impressed me as a symbol rather than as a fact . It stood for something . I associated it with the mind or the heart of Captain Chandis . I never asked him about the white cabin  --  the day after my discovery itsdoor was shut  --  so of his own accord he must have spoken of it and of the woman he had hoped would be its mistress on those long voyages . His revelations must have come out of our talks about women and voyages . He had dinner with me once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my bachelor apartment . The Clelia was to be thoroughly overhauled , and I heard about Harriet Kane , and there were new developments in the Captain 's affairs before the ship , tightened up , passed down the Bay once more . He had met Harriet Kane at a church bazaar during one of his longer sojourns in the Port of New York . " I go to worship occasionally , but I fear I am not a God-fearing man . " He said this with an obvious regret , as if he were helpless against certain obscure and sacrilegious forces at work inside him . While he could not be called a philosopher , I imagine that on the seas , with illimitable heavens over him and only his own will to follow , he pondered many knotty questions that do not trouble ordinary men . But the quiet enigmas demand was not his . He was tortured by loneliness . I can picture him walking his deck with a vague restlessness the sense of which he could not at first grasp . He treated his men well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But his psychic relations with them I was never able to uncover . Perhaps the men were so many automata to him , existing for the sole purpose of helping sail the Clelia erratically around the world . He had mistaken himself for a man who could well do without human intimacy , and the realization that his ship and the seas did not fill the needs within him must have shaken him pretty badly . He sketched what he called " a wretched and abominable period of my life , " when he made frantic efforts to still that rising cry for a companion by swift liaisons in his ports of call . He determined , when at last he no longer refused to recognize his problem , to get himself a wife , some woman " brave and hardy enough " to sail the seas with him . Miss Kane was lingering in his mind , and he sought her out . It happened that she was as lonely on the land as he was on the sea . The stages of the courtship he did not reveal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last voyage alone , to Rio . Then I was to come and get her . We were to be married and she was to sail with me . " Never again was he to be solitary on his ship . That " last voyage alone " was an impatient time for Chandis . He planned some brilliant wedding present for his bride , and then an idea illuminated his whole being . On that work-a-day , gray-toned , grim freighter his chosen companion should have a corner all her own , sacred , inviolate , soothing , safe , beautiful . So came the white cabin . The rest of this part of the Captain 's history sums itself up briefly : Harriet had " thought it over . " " But do n't you love me  --  care for me ? " he asked . She cared for him , yes , a great deal . But there was a sister she supported , suffering in a sanatorium from some chronic ailment . " You 'll go on sending her money , " Chandis assured Harriet . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you like ! " She thanked him . He was most careful to let me feel how grateful she was , how much she truly did care for him . But she could not go with him . " I visit Viola every week . She expects me . She 'd miss me awfully . I could n't do that to her . She has no one else , no one else in the whole world ! " Neither had he . In the past two months he had been alive as neverbefore , and now that was ended . Conflicts must have gone on inside him . Maybe he considered giving up the sea and living ashore with Harriet , so she could visit Viola every week . Maybe he considered shorter voyages . In the end he was too shaken for anything save the acceptance of his lot . He tried to convince me how awful the decision was for Harriet . Perhaps . Anyway , she wept . Captain Chandis was left with the white cabin on his hands , a perpetual reminder of something ineffable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unreason  --  he did not destroy the white cabin . He went on sailing with it under his deck . He preserved its immaculateness . A hope ? A vague hope that some occupant must come to fill it ? He did not tell me of any such hope . It is likely that the hope was in him and that he did not know of it . But from what was soon to happen I feel justified in saying that the white cabin stirred up a terrific storm in that man . He must forever have been conscious of it under him as he stood on his bridge . It must have increased the sense of his solitude a hundredfold . It must have made his heart feel as vacant as the cabin itself . It made utterly impossible for him those infrequent and unsatisfactory liaisons of former times . No doubt now he was living with an " ideal . " His idealism was more than a quality . It was a force . It brings us to the spring morning in Mrs. Harrow 's shop . The coastwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one after another before him . The Captain watching the seaman and the girl . The Captain 's eyes were as fascinating a feature as I have ever seen in any face . I followed their beams to what was transpiring at the counter . The slick second mate was managing , each time he squinted at a fabric , to get his fingers into contact with the girl 's . Alice Foster wore a short-sleeved dress of a darkish stuff , and her arms shone with a full , lovely whiteness . It was easy to guess with what unction the mate would have slid his hands over those arms . Strangely , the girl made no attempt to save her fingers from the man 's . But her face showed an extreme distaste . It was a beautiful face ; the spirit of it was in the eyes , the darkest violet depths I have ever seen . An explanation of that submissiveness came later , when Alice remarked : " We 've got to judge our customers . We get all kinds . It might have meant a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Aunt Catherine had gone off for a week or so to relatives in Pennsylvania . Twice a year she relaxed herself by these jaunts . The store was a good thing ; most sailors do n't count their money closely , and Mrs. Harrow was what you 'd call well fixed , though you would n't have suspected it to look at her or hear her talk . She made a secret of it . The relatives , by the way , were none of Alice 's . Harrow had been the girl 's maternal uncle . He had sheltered this orphaned niece . The aunt , after his decease , continued to shelter her , but at a price  --  to the girl . Sometimes it is hard not to use extravagant terms , but I do n't want to say Alice was a slave . She knew no mode of life , however , beyond her duties at the counter and her household duties in the rooms above , both of which she bad been performing since her thirteenth year . I do n't know if she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense of gratitude she wanted to be as successful as she could with the business . I am more inclined to the fear theory . Mrs. Harrow was a harsh , tall , angular , forbidding person . Those relationships are subtle , anyway . In time I found that Aunt Catherine was ready to put up a fight to keep her niece  --  again I was about to say " slaveher disposal . Consider the girl 's quite startling loveliness , a cash asset in an establishment where males were the buyers . Alice had sunk her personality under that of the aunt and now , with the absent aunt uppermost in her thoughts , she was sinking it under that of the second mate . It struck me as rather horrible . It was only then I became aware that for some time I had been trying to define for myself that girl 's position . It was close to tragic . That implication reached Captain Chandis more quickly than it had reached me . He crossed the floor quickly ( one of his physical peculiarities was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he was at the counter , at that second mate 's elbow . " I should say , sir , that this shirt " I saw him take up a blue shirt and hold it out to the man 's astonished gaze ? " would look very well on you . Very ? well indeed , sir . " The second mate slid his gaze back to the goods on the counter . " Does n't blue become you very well ? " inquired the Captain . " I look all right in blue , sir , " stammered the second mate " I think I 'll take your suggestion , sir . " " That would be a splendid said Captain Chandis . " I mend this shirt  --  highly . " There was no more said . Alice Foster made a package of the blue shirt , the second mate paid for it and walked toward the door . There he hung a moment or so , patently considering some act or word to retrieve himself from complete ignominy . Captain Chandis said quietly to the girl : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Something in morocco , if you have it . " The man with the blue shirt thought better of it and vanished . There is a break here in the exactness of my recollections . I must take it for granted that the Captain had no difficulty in choosing a belt . It is unlikely that any speech passed between him and Alice Foster beyond that necessary for the purchase . Then I was walking on the cobblestones along the river front with Captain Chandis . " That fellow ! " he was saying . " What do women mean to such fellows ? " It was then we began to exchange our views . But our friendship did not develop quickly enough for the Captain to tell me of the beginning of his intimacy with Alice Foster . They must have made profound impressions on each other , those two , at their first meeting . The Captain must have gone back to see her soon , with or without excuse , and they came to an understanding . The first I knew of it was when the Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become my wife . " I shook his hand with the heartiest congratulation . I felt that way about it for both their sakes . Although he had spoken quietly , I could not miss the vibrancy of his voice . I had by then heard the history of the white cabin and I was glad Captain Chandis had found a woman " brave and hardy enough " to care to occupy it . Also , for the aunt I had conceived a distaste . I looked forward to her " slave 's " approaching freedom and to her own looming discomfiture . The spring weather had turned hot , and Mrs. Harrow remained cool on the Pennsylvania farm . Why not ? There was Alice , well drilled , well subjugated , to run the store . The week of absence stretched to two  --  to three . Alice did not write her about the betrothal . I know the girl was holding off the moment as long as possible . Naturally I saw less now of Captain Chandis . He spent much of the day in the store while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had a new life , with lovers ' words , lovers ' gestures . History was repetitious , and on Alice , as he had on Harriet Kane , the Captain lavished all sorts of exotic gifts . There appeared a chain of jade and a blue Spanish shawl splashed with roses . I could go on enumerating . I 'm inclined to think , though , that he never had felt as emotionally toward Harriet Kane as he felt toward Alice . As for the girl , she must have been throbbing at the thought of liberation soon to come . They were to be married in a few short weeks . Happiness shone in Alice 's eyes . She was young again . In years she had been young  --  twentyfive or six . But years are of no consequence . In spirit she had been old . What is twenty-five when nothing lies before it , when nothing beckons it on ? When it can look forward only to selling a pair of thick-soled shoes at thirty , a shirt or a collar at thirty-five , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting , with a man who has spoken of love . I no longer hung about the store . But Captain Chandis now and again sought me out and we would have dinner , " a troie . " Those two could talk of little else than the sailing of the Clelia on June the tenth . The Captain spoke of the ports where they would put in , and Alice listened with her face brilliant . You ca n't imagine the change in that girl . She chattered . This means nothing to you unless you understand how impossible it had been for her to chatter before this , unless you contrast the lifelessness of her voice before the Captain came with its sci iitillaut silver now . She had bought herself some new clothes , not in the latest mode , perhaps , but she looked exquisite . No wonder he was mad about her ! Yes  --  he was mad about her . He devoured her with his eyes , and his voice , speaking to her , was a caress . You should have heard him say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my ship , " he told me . He tried to be casual . His ruddy face , through the smoke of the superb Havana  --  the only cigars he would use  --  betrayed him , as did his fingers meddling with a coffee spoon . " Ah , the white cabin ! " I exclaimed . " It 's beautiful ! " said Alice softly . " Hm ! " Chandis grunted . " What a surprise it was ! " the girl said . " I wish it had been made for you , " Chandis regretted . " What does it matter ? It does n't matter a bit ! " " It should n't , " said the Captain , beaming on her . " The other woman was n't brave and hardy enough . You are . " Alice laughed . Then she grew interested in the women around her . Her femininity was coming out prettily . But after a while I saw a change come over her face . " I wrote to Aunt Catherine to-day . " " I think it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Alice . Some of the eagerness had left her voice and eyes . " I 'm sure your aunt ca n't offer any objections ? " asked the Captain . " She 'll miss me , " the girl replied . " Well ! " His mouth went down at the corners . " You 've your own life to live ! " he declared to Alice . " I take it your aunt will agree to the justice of that ? " " Yes , " Alice answered a little breathlessly . " Oh , yes ! " But as if to negate as quickly as possible the girl 's " Oh , yes ! " Aunt Catherine came rushing into the breach within forty-eight hours of the mailing of Alice 's letter . She was at a disadvantage when she entered the store , for Alice was not unprotected . The aunt found herself confronted by Captain Chandis , whose face informed her that he had ideas of his own . Whatever campaign of obstruction she had plotted on her race homeward from Pennsylvania she had to defer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Alice had certainly struck her a terrific blow . " Aunt Catherine , " said the girl , " this is Captain Chandis . " " Captain Chandis , " replied the aunt . I do n't think she glared at the interloper , for she was not a frank person . " Mrs. Harrow , " said the Captain . The formality of shaking hands , or at least of touching fingertips , was forced upon her . Then the Captain went on , " I trust you will be satisfied that I can take excellent care of your niece , Mrs. Harrow . " She said nothing in answer to that . By no means was she a fool , and Captain Chandis looked a very substantial man . She could hardly have sustained an argument to prove his inability to take care of Alice . Nor did she resort to saying that as the captain was a stranger to her and had been a stranger to Alice until a few brief weeks ago , she was not sure she could trust the girl into his care . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiance owned and commanded a vessel , and Mrs. Harrow had passed enough of her life in the neighborhood of ships and their men to recognize a solid master when she saw one . But what use to her if Alice married the Captain ? What she would have said to the girl in private no one knows . Now she could say nothing . But she must have conveyed some disagreeable intention to Captain Chandis . I never heard him speak disparagingly of any " member of the gentler sex " except that aunt . He always spoke of her as " that woman ! " That woman had depths , I tell you ! She let affairs move forward toward the tenth of June and still she seemed faintly agreeable to everything . Then , one afternoon close to the day set for the marriage , she said : " That child  --  out on the sea ! " Her voice bolted into the silence of the store . The Captain and Alice had gone off to buy luggage , and it was a second or two before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressing me . Nevertheless , all through the colloquy she contrived a queer sort of indirection in her speech and manner , for reasons of her own . " Why not , Mrs. Harrow , in a perfectly staunch ship ? " I asked her . " The loneliness of it ! " she wailed . " She 'll have her husband , " I retorted . " A young girl should have somebody close to her , " she went on , with that irritating indirectness . " She should have somebody who understands her . That child , all alone on the sea ! " " Captain Chandis is n't the Flying Dutchman , " I enlightened her . " He really exists . " " That child is in terror of storms ! She forgets ! " " What does she forget ? " I demanded . " A fearful experience , a most fearful experience ! " But instead of acquainting me with the nature of that experience , she pursued her way . " I should n't let him carry her off like that ! That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost forgetting that ! " " I 'm sure heaven will , " I assured her . In the spring sunlight her face was of yellowish-gray wood with a slit cut to represent a mouth . She wore her hair , still quite black , drawn tight behind knobby temples . At my retort her eyes smoldered . She turned her back on me . There was no use asking about Alice 's fearful experience . It was three or four days later when I had a visit from Captain Chandis I was finishing my breakfast . He did not try to hide his excitement . " That woman has been at it ! " I thought it best to inform him now of my curious interview with Mrs. Harrow . He drew up his brows . " Oh ! " He had not laid down his ebony cane and he gripped it till 1 saw his knuckles whiten . " Oh !  - -  I tell you , she 's been at it ! Last evening I saw that things were turning . There was a change in Alice  --  I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there 's something in the wind . " " Mrs. Harrow told me there was something Alice had forgotten  --  some nasty experience . " He walked up and down my living room . Once or twice he stopped to look out of a window , but I knew he was not absorbed by the spring burgeoning of the park . He wheeled around suddenly . " I 'm going to spoil that woman 's game ! That woman is playing some detestable game , and I 'm going to spoil it ! I 'm going to marry Alice this afternoon ! " That brought me jumping out of my chair . " That 's an idea ! " I cried . " Of course she 's playing a game ! " But what kind of game ? Who can know ? What experience has Alice forgotten ? What does she want of Alice ? " I gave him my opinion of that , perhaps not picking my phrases very moderately . " Wants to keep her as a slave , eh ? We 'll jump ahead of her ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped , though it was a while before the redness left his cheeks . " I wonder , would you do me a favor , Brown ? Would you fetch Alice up here ? Use your judgment  --  tell her I 'm here or not , as you think best . " I shed my dressing gown , got into clothes , and left . The Captain was smoking furiously at a cigar and pacing up and down as I went out . My own mind all the way was taken up with plans , but these were still nebulous when I strolled into the waterfront store . I saw no one . I was sure that presently one of the women must appear from upstairs and I waited in the sunny doorway looking at the sheds , the masts and funnels , the prows . My thoughts reverted to the white cabin in the hold of the Cidia . The ship looked brand new but for the outmoded lines of her build . She had been painted from mast-heads to water line . She was about to carry a bride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's Alice ! " I said to myself . I went to the foot of the staircase and looked up . The doorway above was open . The sob came again . Was the aunt up there or not ? I heard neither voices nor other sounds save the sob again . Then I realized that the situation was in my hands . Mrs. Harrow spent the mornings marketing or going to wholesale houses where she bought her stock , or on some other hidden errands . Nine out of ten forenoons Alice was alone . I should have remembered that . Hesitating no longer , I ran up the stairs . There was no carpet , merely oilcloth , and my feet must have pounded . The sobs stopped abruptly . At the open door I paused . The parlor , stuffed with Victorian upholstery and adorned disproportionately by a bronze and luster chandelier lay before me , empty . Then I saw Alice coming through another door . " Oh ! " She fell back at sight of me . Her face bore the signs of crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I had come for and that Captain Chandis was waiting for her in my rooms . I concealed only his intention of marrying her withoutdelay . No sooner had I spoken than Alice began again to cry . She sat down , bent her face onto her arms on the bulging head of a horsehair sofa . " I 'll go with you , " she said at last , in a muffled voice . " As soon as Aunt Catherine comes back . I must wait . I ca n't leave the store alone . " " Are you telling your aunt where you 're going ? " She looked quickly up at me . " Why not ? I 'm free to do as I see fit . " I murmured agreement . I dared not ask her what those sobs had meant and , despite her willingness to come with me , I was sure this was not the end but the beginning of difficulties . It would have been indelicate to remain during her explanations to the aunt , so I invented business in the vicinity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sub-treasury building at one o'clock . At three , with me as a witness , at the Municipal Building she became Captain Chandis 's wife . They left the next morning for Niagara Falls . I did not go near the store on South Street , so I ca n't say how Mrs. Harrow behaved after the crisis . We were soon to know that she did not consider a mere marriage the crisis . No , indeed ! The simple oath to love and honor was not to upset that woman 's calculations . In other circumstances she might have yielded to a residue of propriety in her , or to some fear of the Almighty , or to tradition , and have agreed that a wife should cleave to a husband . But she must have been furious at the " underhand " way the marriage had been carried off . She had been slighted , insulted ! Rightfully she had concluded that such a coup could not have been devised by Alice , her pensioner , her serf . She would , then , be revenged upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as she had scant time in which to work . But of course she had laid her foundations already  --  Alice 's sobs were the evidence of that . The honeymoon over , Captain Cbandis busied himself with last-day duties on his ship . The couple lived on board . The white cabin at last had its mistress . The Captain 's moods varied between an adolescent 's beaming resilience and a profound , expansive , philosophic , quiet felicity . In Alice , however , I saw even under the bloom that marriage had brought what I should describe as a frantic desire to flee , to flee madly , heedlessly , anywhere  --  but only to flee . The two facts , you may say , ca n't be reconciled . I only answer that the affair was highly complicated and that at this point it broke all rules of logic . Suddenly it plunged from the sphere of the intelligence into that dark , incalculable territory of childish memories , childish terrors , and childish nightmares . Alice had forgotten , but Mrs. Harrow had not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brightest , most sparkling days any June could ever have given us . The old river with its ships was a carnival of light . The Clelia was to weigh anchor with the midnight tide . It would be a night of stars , I was sure . But at present I am talking about the day , the day of blues and golds when every mast and funnel was an uprushing wean of ecstasy . In the midst of this ecstasy it happened . I could not have failed to notice that the aunt resented every brief appearance I put in at the store , where Alice still helped her . I stayed away , of course . I hung about the ship . I had grown attached to her and I should not see her again for years . Then , as I say , it happened . I saw Alice standing in the web of dust-shot light at the entrance of the shed . She waited until she saw me , she made a few steps toward me , shestopped . I did n't know how she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was horrified by her stricken face . " I must speak to you ! " Her voice sounded shattered . I linked my arm into hers and drew her away and we walked into one of the streets debouching on the river . " Aunt Catherine said I should speak to Howard . She said that now I 've made up my mind , I must tell him .. . " " Tell him what ? " I shouted under the uproar of the Elevated trains on Pearl Street . " That  --  that I ca n't go with him . " There was no time for questions , and I was n't going to argue . I said brusquely : " Do n't be idiotic ! You 've got to go with him ! You 're married to him ! " " I ca n't  --  I ca n't ! " She began to cry . Two truckmen loading a van looked at us , probably under the notion that they were witnessing a lovers ' quarrel . Alice 's voice rose to a terrified wail . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took her arm once more and said nothing until we had walked down to South Ferry and seated ourselves on a bench with the harbor before us . Then I said , in a tone still purposely brusque : " Now let 's hear what this nonsense means ! " " I ca n't sail with Howard ! I ca n't ! Aunt Catherine said I should tell him . You tell him . You tell him for me , please ! " Her hands were clasped , she looked into my face , the tears were running with an incongruous brightness down her cheeks . " Aunt Catherine ! " I snarled . " There will be storms on the sea ! I could n't bear it ! I 'd die of fear ! " " You 'd get used to it . Storms at sea are magnificent . " I remembered descriptions of storms at sea . " How do you know you 'd he afraid ? The Clelia has a sound bottom . " " No , no ! I 'd die of fear ! I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that ? " This was news to me .

" " It was fearful ! Fearful ! " " Wo n't you tell me about it ? I did n't know you 'd been on the sea . " , " We were going to Sutton Beach . " " Where 's that ? " " I do n't think it 's there any longer . I think it was in New Jersey . I remember the name of the boat that went there . It was called The Little Silver . " I stared into her face and then I burst into a cruel guffaw of laughter . I could n't have realized my brutality . You see , out of memory somehow I had fished it up . Sutton Beach still escaped me  --  probably one of those sporadic amusement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Little Silver . " An excursion boat ! " I cried . Mice dropped her head . " You do n't know  --  you ca n't understand ! It was a terrible storm ! We thought we were sinking . There was thunder and lightning and a dreadful wind . They said it was a hurricane ! " Well , I could visualize a cockleshell like The Little Silver pretty badly tossed about in ugly weather off the Jersey Coast . But I could n't imagine her in any great peril . " What do you remember of that experience ? " " We thought we were sinking , " she repeated . " I was thrown down . I hurt my knees ! " " You remember that ? You really remember it ? " " Yes , yes , of course . I remember it ! " I shook my head . I could clearly hear that wooden-faced , sharp-eyed , gaunt demon , the aunt , saying , " You were thrown down , Alice !

" But the force of these witless observations went over Alice . " They crowded us into the cabin , " she cried . " The people fell down on their knees and prayed ! Someone screamed , ' We 're going down ! ' " I took Mice 's hand and for a while did not speak . I could think only of the devilish cunning with which that woman had led the girl back to the brink of those grisly , childish terrors . It must have been a rather nasty experience , I 'll admit  --  the flimsy excursion boat flung from wave to wave , the wind screeching through her , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and people screaming  --  and praying .

You must tell him I ca n't ! wait for him  --  tell him I 'll wait for him , I 'll always be waiting for him here . . . " There you have it . Can you think of anything more preposterous than an eggshell of an excursion boat with a name like The Little Silver  --  no , merely the memory of such an imbecilic , bobbing craft  --  getting in the way of the happiness of two human beings ? I do n't know all I said to Alice . I was brutal and compassionate by turns . I tried to make her see the preposterousness , and I think she did see it . But she did not feel it , and that was the necessity . The old demon had succeeded in destroying the normal fabric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness of stark , infantile terrors . All I accomplished after two hours of the hardest toil was to get Alice to say she loved Captain Chandis . She loved him  --  oh , yes ! She would always be his ! But all seamen 's wives wait for their husbands ashore ! " Not when there is a white cabin , " I said . " A white cabin ? " She looked at me mistily . I got up from the bench . Alice remained seated some moments longer . It occurred to me , instead of tormenting Alice further by trying to make her feel what that white cabin stood for in Chandis 's life , to end the talk on a light , encouraging note . " Oh , you 're going with him ! Of course you 're going with him . What else ? " Nor did she the rest of the day give any sign of a contrary intention . I flattered myself I had won . The suggestion of that wild desire to flee had left her eyes . She had awakened from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , the Captain , Alice , the aunt , and myself , in a French restaurant which was one of my weaknesses . The aunt wore black satin , a bit rusty . She spoke seldom and gave me the impression of being about to swoop . I was incapable of a fair , pleasant thought about her and I looked at her , in her unrelieved black , as at a bird of very dubious omen . Her nose had never seemed longer or sharper . I put no stock in her frequent smile . " But Alice , " I reflected , " has won the battle . " At ten o'clock we were back in the parlor over the store . The argument that our digestions had hardly begun to cope with our recent dinners could not dissuade Mrs. Harrow from serving tea , with cookies  --  the kind you see in tins at the grocer 's . Somehow I think often and with leniency of those cookies . It must have cost her more than money to buy them . She was an exceedingly parsimonious woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the sign of the saving grace somewhere inside that aunt , the sign that she , too , was making a blind effort toward decency . Captain Chand is showed his appreciation by eating all the cookies he could manage , with two cups of tea . Then , toward half past eleven , he drew out his watch . " Alice , my dear , " he said . She looked sharply up over her poised cup . The cup quivered . " What is it , Howard ? " " We must be going , my dear . I should have been on my ship an hour ago . " " Is it time ? " She set down the cup . Then the aunt spoke . " Are you really taking her , Captain Chandis ? Are you really carrying her away ? " What a humor-flavored appeal she put into it ! It would have thrown anybody off guard , and the Captain laughed and said he was really taking Alice away . " Do be careful of her , Captain Chandis ! Do n't sail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such dreadful places where there are so many shipwrecks ! " The Captain had risen . Alice sat rigid , but her face told me she was becoming a child again . Her eyes sought each stick of furniture in that stuffed parlor through which she had passed every day of her life for nearly fifteen years . Then she raised a hand to her throat . Her eyes flew to the Captain , who was the sea to her , who was Hatteras and the Horn and waves and hurricanes and tumult and " people praying on their knees " ? and sinking . " I 'll wait for you , " she said weakly . " I ca n't be back , my dear . I must remain on my ship now . Come . " " I 'll wait for you . I 'll wait for you here , always . " Her eyes darted around the room , the room of a house where there was stability --  -- a house that would never be tossed by the seas of Hatteras or the Horn or even the Jersey Coast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to ice . He stared at his wife . Her face was white as the lace neckband of her gray dress , and her eyes a strange , weird dark . Her fingers gripped the table edge as though she would not be torn away . " Do you mean that you are not coming with me ? " She moved her head with a heartrending motion . Her lips silently made the syllables , " / ca n't ! " He did not ask why . At " that woman " he threw a glare of hate as he recognized her work . His face was stern and pitiless . In an ominously quiet voice he said to the weeping girl : " You must come , Alice . " Then he added , " I give you five minutes . " Her sobs came faster , the tears blinded her , as she cried out , " I 'm too afraid . I 'll wait for you ! Let me wait  --  let me wait for you ! " Never had I seen such fury as in Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Minutes passed . " Are you coming , Alice ? " he asked . " No , " answered her soundless lips . " You have two minutes . " His watch was inexorably in his hand . " Next time  --  I 'll sail with you . " The aunt spoke . " But if she does n't want to go , Captain ? If she 's afraid ? " He turned on her with a clenched hand , and I thought he was going to strike . " Silence , " he shouted . It silenced her . " Now , Alice , " he said . She rose from the chair . She looked at the Captain . Then she began to retreat . Her hands groped behind her as if seeking something tangible . She was making for an inner room . " The time is up , Alice ! " She screamed . He bounded forward , caught her in his arms , and strode toward the stairway . She continued to scream . She struggled in his arms . She beat at him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she hit , not his face . He carried her down the stairs . Her screams sank to moans . The aunt , flinging her black-satin arms aloft , began to yell : " You ca n't do this ! She has a right ! I 'll call help ! You ca n't ! This is an outrage ! " He crossed the store implacably . The door had been bolted while we were above , and he shot back the bolt . We were outside , in a balmy night of stars . Ships about to take the tide set up a hooting . " You ca n't dare ! " screeched the gesticulating aunt . " A policeman ! Where is a policeman ? " It becomes rather a jumble here . The aunt 's threats , Alice 's struggles and sobs , a spattering of men springing up around us , jostling after us down the long shed , a chiaroscuro of blacks and whites under the intense glare of arc-lamps , the whiskered Dellops meeting us at the gangplank and exclaiming , " Here you are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir ? " The aunt enlisting some riffraff always ready for a fight , in lieu of a policeman ; a feeble attempt to obstruct the Captain ; old Dellops ' shout , " Here ! Here ! " and the glint of a revolver in his hand . The riffraff scattering and saving its face by a few feeble , doubtful jests . An insane five minutes . The moorings were cast off . The Clelia moved . The blare of her siren sounded comically loud for her six thousand tons . She seemed to be defying the universe . I watched from the pier-head until her lights were lost in the measureless distance stretching out toward the sea . Then I turned slowly homeward , feeling as if Captain Chandis 's triumph were my own . But was it a triumph ? For the answer to that question I had to wait over three years . The truth forces me to append an epilogue in the sentimental vein . It was in November after the third year when the Clelia steamed up the river . By the way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have persuaded Mrs. Harrow to retire had done so  --  Mrs. Harrow had died . The Clelia entered her wharf with a thick coating of ice on masts , rails , and hull . She gleamed like a crystal ship . There had been bad weather on the ocean that month . All I wish to say , however , is that I saw Alice in the bows . A heavy , furry cloak was wrapped around her against the sharp wind and she wore a close-fitting headgear . A few strands of hair flurried across her forehead . Her cheeks were tan and whipped by gales into ruddiness . There was an immense well-being upon her . " Were there storms , Mrs. Chandis ? " I asked , a little later . " Oh , yes , of course there were storms ! " she answered , and laughed .
