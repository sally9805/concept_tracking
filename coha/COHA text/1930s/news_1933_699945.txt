txt Members of the Chicago board of education launched a campaign last night to prove to the public that their $5 ; 000,000 economy program will save Chicago 's public school system from destruction . James B. McCahey , president of the board , asserted that the penniless condition of the school sys. tem , with teachers and creditors unpaid , was due to the wasteful spending by politically controlled School trustees dating back to 1919 . Mr. McCnhey charged that the agitation against economy In the school system and the board 's attempt to save money and bring regular pay days to the huge teaching staff was being engineered " because soft Jobs and sinecures , many of which were created through political influence , are eliminated " in the retrenchment program . . Shows School Cost . In 1900 the Chicago public school system spent $7,597,551 on educational activities , with an average cost per pupil of $38.02 , Mr. McCahey said , whilerin:1939 , educational expenditures were $56,057,330 and the cost per pupil had mounted to $124.90 . " In the years between 1900 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school system , " he said . . " Many new jobs were created which mere not directly connected with the fundamental educational activities of the schools . With property values increasing and tax collections mounting in the years of prosperity little objection to these added expenditures was heard . These extra activities brought with them many soft jobs for political favorites . " Then came the depression years with rapidly decreasing property values and steadily falling tax collections . But school expenditures stayed at their high level until the rapidly growing deficit destroyed the school board credit , stopped the teachers ' pay days and threatened the system with bankruptcy . " Comparison with Business . Corporations and business houses . faced with similar situations , Mr. McCahey said , weathered the economic storm by cutting out all frills and luxuries , by slashing salaries and other expenses ; by trimming everywhere possible . " But school expenditures continued at their high rate , " he continued . " This year we are forced to drastic action . All the luxuries and frills ac. cumulated in the years of prosperity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school system is to escape financial wreckage . " Each one of us  --  merchant , manufacturer , clerk , or laborer  --  has been compelled by lower wages or reduced dividends to cut his household and Personal expenses . Luxuries , many of which had come to be regarded as necessities In the days of prosperity , were given up . We soon found that we could get along without them , but we hope to go back to them some day soon . - " it must be with the school system . Financial- necessity compels us to forego activities of lesser value . When the school finances are put on a ' sound basis . and the ' credit of the school board is restored , consideration can again . be given to educational ex pansion : ' . Aim to End Solt Jobs . " But - the - " soft jobs , and , political sinecures which crept in with many of these extra activities we hope are gene forever . ' ' , " The rank and file of teachers and school employes  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an honest day 's work , and who have the best interests of our school system at heart ? are in sympathy with the-economy program : There . will be no drastic change in the number of employes in the public schools . There will be no change In the amount of educational opportunity given to the children . " The first . statement in the campaign to show that by embarking on an economy program the school board was not " crippling , " " wrecking , " " destroying , " or " emasculating " the education of Chicago children was issued by Trustee Ernst Buehler , vice president of the board . Charges . had been made by various critics that athletics would be doomed because of the reduced force in the physical education department under the economy order . Mr. Buehler was selected to clarify this matter and ex ? plain the lopping off . of Jobs . He has for many years been . Identified with German turnverein and athletic activities in Chicago . " Our economy program in the physical education department might be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Buehler . " Physical training of the students will be continued to the same extent as heretofore , and athletics in the schools will be carried on as In past years . Overmanned , lie Asserts . " The department , like others in the - school system , had experienced a mushroom growth beyond all bounds of real needs . It was overmanned . Many of the instructors taught only one to three classes a day . The waste or their time was enormous . We only seek to get a full day 's work out of each man or woman ? In- the depart . merit . " Mr. Buehler next pointed out that experts in the field agree that one Instructor to a gymnasium is sufficient . Shows Increase in Staff . " Twelve years ago two physical training instructors took care of 3,000 pupils in Lane Technical High school , " he continued . " Last year there were sixteen instructors for 6,000 pupils at this school . How these sixteen gymnasium teachers spent all their time is difficult to understand . Maybe they played pinochle or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school spent . considerable time amusing themselves that way . " In one of the medium sized high schools , with half a dozen Instructors , we found that some of these teachers had only one or two classes a day . They spent part of their spare time in unimportant school work and the rest of it in keeping out of sight . Some of them did considerable swimming In the school pool for their own enjoyment . " Soft Jobs Cut Out , He Says . If high school athletics is curtailed , according to Mr. Buehler , blame will be placed on the principals , for In past years they have been able to provide competent coaches for the teams from the physical instructors and , members of the faculty . Mr. Buehler declared that the school board had not eliminated physical training In the elementary schools . " The regular teachers will continue , as they have in the past , to give physical training Instruction In school hours under proper supervision , " he said . " All that has been done is to cut out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
