txt Frankly accepting present government bond , market conditions as unsuitable for a conventional long-term offering , Secretary of Treasury Morgenthau has announced a September 15 financing operation whereby both short and long-term obligations will be offered in exchange for $1.250,000,000 in fourth Liberty Bonds called for redemption October 15 . At the same time the Treasury offered a new series of two year 1/7. , - ; notes for 5524,748,500 of Treasury certificates which mature September 15 . All offerings are made on a purely exchange basis and no cash subscriptions will be received for any of the three conversion issues . Under the unusual procedure adopted , holders of the Liberties will have the right to exchange them for either 10-12 year 3,4,4 , bonds , or for four year 21-2r , : - notes . In either case interest adjustments will be made so that all owners of the called bonds will receive interest on them in full to October 15 , while interest payments on the new securities will accrue from September 15 , the date of issue . Two New Departures Both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those accepting the Liberty conversion offerings , constitute new departures for Treasury exchange operations . While department experts would make no official comment on the financing , it is understood that the rates on the bonds and four-year notes are considered highly favorable in comparison with the yields of outstanding issues . It is freely predicted in government circles here that the exchange will involve more notes than bonds , in view of the demand of bankers for shorter term obligations. , The offering of both notes and bonds is understood to meet the investment needs of the banks , and at the same time supply a suitable long term issue for a class of investors now holding the Liberties who will desire to take advantage of the Government offer rather than take cash and reinvest in some existing long-term obligation . Skepticism On Long-Terms The Treasury attitude apparently is one of extreme skepticism concerning the issuance of long-term bonds at this time . However , it is making the offering to meet a particular class of investor . Department officials are now confronted with a decision on whether to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any part of the remaining 53.200,000,000 4th Liberty 4 ' , 4s outstanding . This decision must come within the next month if further conversion is to be made . The results of the September 15 operation , and the condition of the market next month , will be the guiding factors taken into consideration in determining the next move . The results of the current operation also will determine whether another issue will be necessary in October to meet with cash any of the remaining called fourth Liberties which are not exchanged . While it is held unlikely that any large volume of Liberties will be held over . Treasury officials are leaving the way open for meeting any cash demands that might arise . Another conversion issue would be necessary only if a large portion of the fourths did remain in the hands of holders October 15 . Small de- mands for cash would be met through the cash balance in the Treasury . Reserve Officials Discussed Matter Federal Reserve Officials last week took up with the Treasury the matter of carrying out the exchange prcgram , and indications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transaction a success . The Treasury plan to offer bonds , hedged though it is by the short-term option , is somewhat of an upset of the pre-announcement guesses 111 investment circles . Many contended that the department would not risk a long-term issue at this time . However , the Treasurys ' early plans called for a bond issue , and he last minute change , it is learned , was the addition of the four-year nates in order to give some diversification to the holders of the 4th 42.45 .
