txt The honorary degree of Night Superintendent of the Central Park Zoo was bestowed yesterday upon Alfred E. Smith . The award came as a complete surprise to almost every one present at the dedicatory ceremonies of the new " picturebook " menagerie at ' the Arsenal , just west of the rim of the park at Sixty-fourth Street . The Park Department , through its general superintendent , W. Earle Andrews , conferred the honor upon the former Governor . Outdoing universities , which provide mere parchment to recipients of honorary doctorates , the department supplied a bronze medal larger than a silver dollar . Mr. Andrews fastened it to the left lapel of Mr. Smith 's black coat . It hung there , precariously but permanently , on a blue , white and orange ribbon , throughout the program . And it was an unusual program . Mr. Smith made a speech highly praising a man who recently ran for Governor on the Republican ticket . Commissioner of Public Welfare William Hodson , hatless and enthusiastic , sang a song . An 11-year-old East Side boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turkey to the most distinguished alumnus of Cherry Street . Through it all , 1,200 invited guests and more than 15,000 others who lined the near-by walls and walks looked , listened and laughed . A few hours before the dedication , Park Commissioner Robert Moses informed aides by telephone that he would be unable to be present . A cold and doctor 's orders kept him at his home , 7 Gracie Square , all day . But he listened to the broadcast of the ceremonies and heard glowing tributes to himself by all who spoke . Mr. Andrews appeared before the battery of microphones on the Arsenal steps at 1:58 P. M. The surprise medal  --  with a lion on one side and a sycamore leaf on the other  --  was attached to Mr. Smith within six minutes . The recipient put aside the cinnamon-colored derby with the two holes above each ear and advanced to respond . A vermilion balloon popped out of a child 's hand and soared away in the general direction of Yonkers . Mr. Smith cleared his throat mightily and began : " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park and my dear children  --  not forgetting the grownups . I 've been graduated from a lot of universities , and I 've been an honorary member of almost everything in which you can be honorary . " His right arm cut a swift arc in the crisp air . " But being honorary night superintendent of the zoo is something I consider a real honor . " Promises to Be on the Job . The new medal flipped about with the gesture , flashing in the sun . He took a fresh start " And if you people hear any roaring in the zoo at night that sounds like lions and tigers , you need n't be afraid . It 'll just mean that I 'm on the job talkin ' to ' em . In the past I 've been pretty good at talking to tigers  --  but not so good with elephants . " When Mr. Moses was appointed Park Commissioner , I used all the influence I had with him to get him to work on a new zoo . And now look at him ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zoo that 's one of the finest of its kind in the world . I congratulate the Mayor on the appointment of Commissioner Moses . " Mr. Smith particularly praised Mr. Moses 's State park ' work on Long Island . " It 's being talked about all over the world , " he boomed . Then , in conclusion : " I bid you welcome to this new zoo as night superintendent . And I hope you have a good time . " More gaudy balloons dotted the air . The night superintendent sat down , looked critically at the line of Fifth Avenue apartment buildings biting irregularly into the blue sky , put on his hat , and chewed a cigar , Schoellkopf Speaks . Alfred H. Schoellkopf , chairman of the State TERA , which provided much of the money to rebuild the zoo , spoke next . " The zoo is an illustration of the kind of work that can be accomplished under an intelligent and well-planned relief program , " he said . Then came the turkey interlude . The crepe-paper bedecked wagon rumbled around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children ; ? singing " East Side , West Side . " The horses pulled up at the foot of the steps . Eddie of 87 Jackson Street leaned from the high seat , clutching the turkey . The Mayor and the former Governor , with his medal , were there to receive it . The gobbler fluttered unbecomingly once or twice , then , realizing it was after Thanksgiving , nestled comfortably in the arms of the night superintendent . The wagon moved on . " ? four , six , eight , who do we appreciate ? " ? echoed from it . The answer to the question was indistinguishable , but easy . Mr. Hodson was introduced . " I. " he smiled , " shall sing a song . " He did . It began : " I went to the animal fair , the birds and beasts were there . " It told , in lilting rhythm , of the " old baboon , " the " monk who got drunk , " the " elephant who sneezed , and fell on his knees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious . " The next big job Commissioner Moses ought to do , " he said , " is to build an institution where a lot of the wild people and crackpots in the city can be put on exhibition . Everybody agrees we have to have relief ? but nobody wants to pay for it . The other fellow must pay the taxes . I 'd like to have a lot of these wild men put into an institution where the people could see them ; and I 'd like to suggest some of them who ought to be put there . " But he did n't , not just then . La Guardia the Last Speaker . Mayor La Guardia was the last speaker . " Praise from Governor Smith is praise indeed , " he asserted . " And all I 've got to say is this  --  that any one who 's administering such a gigantic job and absorbs all the abuse that Commissioner Hodson does and still can sing , he 's all right and he can take care of himself . The more they abuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll answer our critics with song . " Though the speeches were over , the program had just begun . A quartet of olive-garbed trumpeters performed ; two fantastically colored boxes flanking the platform burst open ; a lion was in one , a gorilla in the other . The scarlet-and-white clad fife and drum corps of Public School 71 , the Bronx , strode by , escorting a pony barouche . In it sat tiny Martha Jane Andrews , daughter of the park superintendent , and 8-year-old Margaret Lyons of 118 West Sixty-third Street . They gave an enormous key to the Mayor . Mr. La Guardia inserted it in the lock of the " cover " of the " picture/ book , " displaying a charging elephant on a yellow background . " All ready ? " queried the Mayor . " Let ' er go , " said the honorary Night Superintendent . The door swung open . " A is for Ipe , B is for Buffalo , " said the first page . From within came a great squawking ; it was the parrots and macaws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jean , and his 3-year-old son , Eric , and advanced on the zoo . The former Governor did the same with his grandsons , Arthur and Walter . The official tour ended and the waiting throng was admitted to the zoo . Inspector Charles Neidig of the Fourth Division said 200 policemen had been assigned to the crowd , composed largely of eager-eyed children . Late last night , when the last of the peanuts had been eaten and the last of the balloons had floated away over the trees , a nearly silent tread was discerned on the cold pathways of the " picture-book " zoo . Or at least , so many reports said . And no one who gave it a thought had the least doubt that the lone sentinel was the honorary Night Superintendent .
