On the Rocks ( by George Bernard Shaw ; produced by the Federal Theatre ) . " Every drunken skipper trusts to Providence . But one of the ways of Providence with drunken skippers is to run them on the rocks . " Taking this gloomy pronouncement by Captain Shotover in Heartbreak House as his text , Author Shaw wrote On the Rocks to while away the tedium of his world tour in 1933 . Last week , its belated cut-price U. S. premiere brilliantly rounded out the Federal Theatre 's season . <P> Current convention for producers of Shaw plays is to dress up the protagonist in whiskers to resemble George Bernard Shaw . Thus disguised , Actor Philip Bourneuf talks his way brilliantly through the heroically talky role of Sir Arthur Chavender . No drunken skipper , but a tired , shilly-shallying Prime Minister , Sir Arthur is discovered , when On the Rocks begins , fiddling aimlessly about the interior of No. 10 Downing Street while an angry mob howls in the streets outside . Halfway through Act I , he receives a visit from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisks him away to a sanatorium on the ground that his ineffectiveness is caused not by too much but by too little intellectual exercise . <P> In Act II , Sir Arthur gives what Author Shaw apparently considers convincing evidence of a cerebral reawakening by proposing a benevolent dictatorship , including nationalization of banks , property and labor . The Prime Minister 's brave proposals come to nothing , but by the time his cabinet , his constituents , a fierce young female Marxist ( Ardis Gains ) , and his family have indicated their more or less reluctant disapproval , audiences have been treated to a symposium so full of sparkling , perfectionist common sense that they may well forget that they have seen nothing closer to physical action than a young agitator 's feeble threat to break a window .
