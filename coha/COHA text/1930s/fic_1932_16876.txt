Brush and feet pass out of scene . 3 : EXTERIOR CHICAGO BALL PARK ENTRANCE - FULL SHOT The foreman of the street cleaners looks down at the matches and up at the retreating form of the white wing who has just cleaned the sidewalk .

Paul stops his sweeping , leans on his broom and narrows his eyes as he looks at his companion .

Something about him seems to tower above his surroundings and his fellowmen . As he stands there looking at his Swedish compatriot , Oscar , and glancing at the throng about the ball park entrance , you can almost see his embryonic instincts as a planner and organizer begin to operate behind those grey eyes . He nods his head , motions to the other white wings and they gather around him  --  looking up to him for leadership . We should feel that even though paul Kroll is only a street sweeper , we are , nevertheless , standing in the presence of unbelievable power . &nbsp; PAUL KROLL ( to companions ) Boys , my friend Oscar here , has just given me an idea . There are six of us here . Five of us can do all the work . What do you say  --  let 's take turns each day going into the ball game . Our uniforms will let us in free . &nbsp; OSCARGoot , Paul .

He parks his broom and shovel in one of the ticket booths and disappears in the crowd . The others watch him , but the sudden re-appearance of the foreman causes them to scatter quickly back to their tasks .  --  3  --  6 : EXT .

( Paul does n't answer , but from the way he looks at the foreman and then glances to the ball park entrance , you can already see another plan hatching behind his grey eyes ) So the Swede has gone to the ball game , eh ?

With a dull thick stare of an intoxicated man , he watches Paul at the piano . The foreman 's girl , a pretty but rather slovenly creature , called Babe , sits over in a corner on the side of the bed , taking everything in , but having little to say . &nbsp; FOREMANHey , tie the can to that highbrow music . Put something snappy on the phonograph . Paul takes a record from a stack on-lower part of table and puts it on an old-fashioned horned phonograph . Use a Hawaiian Melody or a popular song of about 1919 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to distract the audience 's attention from the foreman 's drunken monologue .  --  5  --  &nbsp; FOREMANAtta boy .

That dough you put for me in the bank every week  --  You know who earns it ? You could n't guess in a hundred years . Nobody ! ( shaking his head ) Nobody earns it , that 's who ! Why we got eight men on the payroll now that do n't even exist .

What we 've got to do now is to keep one person from using one match to light more than one thing . &nbsp; ERICCSONI  --  I  --  I do n't believe I quite understand , Mr. Kroll . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time you try to do a thing like that . &nbsp; PAUL KROLL ( impatiently ) I 'm not talking about an inferior article that will only stay lighted for a moment . It is n't a problem for our chemists or manufacturers . We 've got to make the people themselves voluntarily quit using one match for more than one light .  --  27  --  &nbsp; SECOND ADVERTISING MANBut , Mr. Kroll , that ca n't be done . People will do as they please . &nbsp; PAUL KROLLI 'll tell you how it can be done . We 've played on vanity , fear of burns , and on the love of cautious parents for their careless children , but we 've overlooked one important fact in humanity ! ( he pauses for effect ) And that is superstition ! I want you to create a world-wide propaganda in every language until mankind believes that it is bad luck for more than one person to light a cigaret from the same match . &nbsp; ERICCSON ( unctuous as ever ) Oh , but Mr. Kroll  --  that would counteract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let 's make it three cigarets . " It 's bad luck to light a third cigaret on the same match ! " Tie up your new campaign with the war ... Spread stories that it was a superstition in the trenches that when three men lit their cigarets from the same match , one of the three never came back . Get writers to using it  --  have playwrights build scenes around this theme  --  It may take a year and a fortune to put it over  --  but I want it done ! It will mean that one-third more matches will be used . Our sales ought to go up around 33 l/3% and that will swell our profits 42% . A secretary brings in a telegram . 61 : CLOSE SHOT OF KROLL He reads it with annoyance . Then he shrugs his shoulders . &nbsp; PAUL KROLL ( to the advertising man ) All right . Get up and get busy .

But there 's a decision that you ought to make , about that matter of the dividend . &nbsp; PAUL KROLLAnnounce the regular dividend . &nbsp; ERIKThe directors are not in favor of paying the full dividend at this time . &nbsp; PAUL KROLLI do n't care what the directors are in favor of !

Sonia is indolently smoking a cigarette as Paul enters . She puts down the cigarette and runs joyously to meet him . &nbsp; SONIA LOMBARDPaul ! Dearest ! &nbsp; PAUL KROLL ( unsmiling and stern ) May I ask what you mean by sending me such a telegram ? The joyous expression fades from her face and she becomes angry . &nbsp; SONIA LOMBARD ( sharply ) It means that I 've stood for all the lies I 'm going to !

Go on  --  talk some more  --  ( tauntingly as Paul stands with bowed head ) Go on my dear liar ! I 'm listening ! Tell me how much you 've missed me ! &nbsp; PAUL KROLL ( his hurt seems irreparable : his voice low ) If words could describe the pain I feel when you 're away from me  --  my dear , I ca n't tell you how lonely and wretched I am without you . She is listening in spite of herself . Her face softening a bit . &nbsp; SONIA LOMBARD ( softly ) Paul ! &nbsp; PAUL KROLL ( stepping toward her as the hypnosis begins to work ) You will never know how many times I have almost decided to throw everything over-board  --  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks , factories , railways ,  --  so that I could hasten to your side .

He pours a glass of wine for her ; and then as if it were of little importance , he says : &nbsp; PAUL KROLLBy the way Sonia , were you able to inspire Rodinski with confidence in you ? Instantly she freezes , furious in the belief that he is merely using her again . Paul sees that this siren never again will be wholly docile . He is really so enraged that he would love to throttle her ; but of course he is too consummate an actor to reveal his feelings , so he goes to work on her once more . He takes her hand and though she is a little reluctant , he opens the clenched fingers and looks down at the  --  32  --  soft little palm . &nbsp; PAUL KROLLSo soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wonder , ( musingly and in tender tones ) if you realize that within your hand is all my future , my honor , and ( ominously ) it might he , even my life . &nbsp; SONIA LOMBARD ( sunk again ) Really , Paul ?

He buries his head in her lap . &nbsp; SONIA LOMBARDPaul ! 65 : CLOSE SHOT She strives to comfort his wounded heart . &nbsp; SONIA LOMBARDIs it Rodinski who can do you harm ? ( Paul nods ) Then you have nothing to worry about , ( triumphantly ) I can twist him around my little finger .

Paul rises quickly to his feet . Before she can move he is reaching for his hat . 66 : MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT Sonia , immediately suspicious again . She watches him narrowly . &nbsp; SONIA LOMBARDWhere are you going , Paul ? &nbsp; PAUL KROLLYou must realize my dear , that anything that takes me from you must be of the utmost urgency . &nbsp; SONIA LOMBARD ( mollified ) When are you coming back ? &nbsp; PAUL KROLLIn a very little while  --  just as quickly as I can . &nbsp; SONIA LOMBARD ( doubtfully ) I do n't know whether to believe you .

Rodinski halts abruptly ; tries earnestly , but unsuccessfully , to conceal his astonishment . He stares at Kroll . &nbsp; PAUL KROLL ( suavely but relentlessly ) For the Government to confess it can not balance the budget would , I 'm afraid , be a very dangerous situation for somebody considering the temper of the people just now . Why , even you , financial advisor to the Government , might unhappily be the target for a firing squad ! &nbsp; RODINSKI ( pales but tries to bluff it out ) You are mad , Kroll ! You 've been grossly misinformed ! The budget balances ! &nbsp; PAUL KROLL ( shrugging ) I hope so for your sake , Rodinski .

It is a certificate of a high Polish order , and it was given to " ANTONE RODINSKI " as a reward for " DISTINGUISHED AND PATRIOTIC SERVICE TO POLAND " .

I told Kroll back in Holmtide that he was a fraud and a rogue ! And I  --  The door suddenly opens , interrupting Larsen . They all turn as Kroll , smiling confidently strides into the room . He stops abruptly when he sees the intense almost frowning , faces fronting him . &nbsp; PAUL KROLL ( recovering himself and trying to summon up the famous old charming smile ) Why gentlemen , I did n't expect to find you here .

There was n't one of us had the courage to tell this crook that Pinchot discovered Kroll 's Italian bonds were forgeries  --  and that he cabled to his Paris bank to cancel the forty million dollar credit he made Kroll to take up our loan . Kroll straightens up , his arms drop to his sides , his whole body and facial expression show defeat at last , as he hears Larsen 's voice addressing ERIK : &nbsp; LARSEN 'S VOICE ( off scene , growing fainter ) And I can promise you , Erik , that no matter what comes out of this , you 'll go to prison !

All other giants dwindle in comparison . Napoleon , Charlemagne , Hannibal , Alexander , Ghengis Khan  --  these used blood and gold and iron and gunpowder ; and they gained immortality as much from their final failures as from their triumphs . Kreuger was the colossus of them all . They would have been his errand boys today ! They changed destiny  --  he made it ! How ? On the slender sticks of cheap little matches he built a globe-girdling empire that literally altered the history of mankind . Matches  --  matches  --  matches ! With the insatiable appetite and incredible cunning this Titan strode across the world , until he towers immeasureably above all the achievers of all times . Yet , from the day the midwife said " It 's a boy ! " to that grim night the coroner said " Suicide ! " this man was a crook . Kingdoms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chessboards ; statesmen and diplomats and parliaments and banking consortoriums and industrial magnates were his puppets . Scopeless power , fabulous wealth , utter unscrupulousness , and men and women , these were the tools with which he wove the tapestry of financial supremacy . Beautiful women he made love to and ruined and then used without qualms  --  venal politicians were the prey of these Delilahs , their sex frailties were the lathes on which he turned out his schemes . Like an octopus he literally gobbled up the world until all nations and all industries and all peoples paid him tribute .  --  NA  --  Built thus on sheer and unmitigated crookedness , the audience understands from the opening scene of the picture that he is casually spinning the first strand in a web of retribution that eventually will strangle him . We have been able to establish his character with one striking and revelatory sequence  --  and thereafter the picture unfolds with gigantic brush-strokes that paint the portrait of a giant doomed to destruction . Always just one step ahead of his fate , the watchers , breathless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cupidity and insensate ambition roll slowly on and on until it overtakes its creator and crushes him to a crimson clot . The drama marches undeviatingly forward with the inevitableness of a Greek tragedy ; the Law of Compensation will work  --  it MUST work , else this earth were mad futility ; and impartial yet merciless Avenging Justice sits upon a cloud looking down on the super-crook of the ages ravishing a world of trusting humanity  --  looking down and waiting for the inevasible hour when he will be entangled in the meshes of his own duplicity . The horror of it all is , that he drags the world down with him  --  bankruptcies , closed factories , ruined industries , gutted banks , despoiled depositors and investors , defalcations , suicides , hunger , shattered homes , betrayed hopes , and , more cruelly tragic still , the loss of human faith  - -  -  the collapse of confidence of the poor people in their leaders . Lord , lord , if Kreuger , the miracle Messiah , turns out to be a common crook , where , alas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an episodic saga of the arch-racketeer of the ages  - -  -  a racket built on little matches ! pp. 91-112 &nbsp;
