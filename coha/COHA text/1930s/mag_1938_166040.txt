In the last few years , artificial insemination of human beings has become a highly successful science . Most difficult step has been the finding of suitable proxy fathers . Last week Dr. Ivy Albert Pelzman of Georgetown University School of Medicine said that he is starting an agency for proxy fathers in Washington . Blonds , brunets , redheads , Jews , Catholics and Protestants will be on the list , he said , and a prospective mother can have her child influenced in every physical respect except sex . Heredity and background of all candidates are thoroughly investigated . Since the human male attains his highest fertility during his twenties , Dr. Pelzman 's present list of 15 is drawn mostly from medical students and interns who are glad to get the $25 fee per insemination . Operation of the bureau will be very simple . Dr. Pelzman will merely collect to order tubes of fresh , fertile spermatozoa and deliver them to a gynecologist . <P> Process of insemination is equally simple . With a syringe a gynecologist introduces a few drops of semen directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Best time for artificial insemination is the fertile period occurring from ten days to two weeks after menstruation begins . More complicated are the legal arrangements . Both husband and wife must sign a joint agreement permitting the wife to bear the child of a third person . The identity of the donor is kept secret , and if he is married his wife must give her written consent as well . Other practical suggestions made by Drs . Frances Isobel Seymour and Alfred Koerner of Manhattan : 1 ) A physician should never consent to use a relative as donor . Too many emotional complications may follow . 2 ) A donor 's blood group should correspond to that of the husband so that legal disproof of the child 's paternity is impossible without presentation of the double-signed agreement . <P> Most successful case of artificial in semination , said Dr. Pelzman , was a Chicago woman who bore two artificially conceived children , has the constant pleasure of hearing her unknowing friends say : " They look just like their father .
