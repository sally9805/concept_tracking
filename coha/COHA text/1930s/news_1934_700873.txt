txt Samuel Insull bore the full force of the government 's attack today as he went I through his second complete day on I the witness stand in Federal Judge James H. Wilkerson 's court . The jury and a jammed court room saw a swift change come over Insull as his direct testimony ended and a searching cross-examination was begun by Special Prosecutor Leslie E. Salter . Charged with participating with sixteen co-defendants in a scheme to defraud by use of the mails in the sale of the stock of the Corporation Securities Company , Insull had told the story of his life under the questioning of his attorney , Floyd E. Thompson . It was a rambling narrative told in the manner of a man giving an explanation to a classroom . But on cross-examination Insull sank back into his chair and sparred with the prosecution . His answers were short , direct . In his answers he did not face the prosecutor . He turned to the jury . Many times he became excited and almost shouted , but told Mr. Salter he was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the conclusion of direct examination , which took up half the morning , Insull discussed for the first time the details of his departure from the United States in June , 1932 , and his reasons for resisting extradition , , after he had been , indicted here . He said that he eft the country because he was broken in health and had been through a terrific ordeal after his investment trusts went into receivership . He went to Paris , then to Turin , Italy . After his indictment in the State courts Oct. 3 , 1932 , he said , he received a telegram from John A. Swanson , then State 's Attorney , asking him to return . " At that time Mr. Swanson was running for re-election , " Insull said . " After spending a night in Turin I got some advice from some of my friends that I probably would find it more desirable to go to Greece . What I was engaged in was trying to avoid coming back to Chicago and being prosecuted as part of a political campaign purely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Federal indictment under which he is being prosecuted bad not been returned when the State was trying to extradite him from Greece . " Personal Motive " at Issue . Mr. Salter began his cross-examination quietly , but soon was working toward the heart of the government 's case . He asked Insull whether he did not have a " personal motive " in forming Insull Utility Investments , Inc. , and Corporation Securities , in addition to wishing to consolidate management of the operating companies through them . Insull inquired what the prosecutor meant by " personal motive. ? Mr. Salter then brought out that Insull 's salaries from his companies were $481,000 in 1929 , $434,413 in 1930 and $485,767 in 1931 . Insull admitted the salary from each company and the prosecutor insisted that he must have had a " personal motive . " Insull turned to the jurors , held out his hands to them and replied : " I received those salaries . I think that ordinarily , gentlemen , the laborer is worthy of his hire . " The jurors looked startled . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salter wanted to know . Interchange Is Stormy . The witness said it was not done " in any circular . " Both men were shouting as Insull insisted that that was his only answer . The Insull family and Halsey , Stuart &; Co. , four of whose officials are defendants , each received 1,000,000 shares of Corporation Securities common for the securities they contributed to the founding of the company . Mr. Salter asked the witness if he had not anticipated his holdings being worth $25,000,000 and Halsey , Stuart 's the same amount only if the public bought the stock . Insull said it had never occurred to him . . " Did n't you approve of Harold L. Stuart buying 6,650 units of Corporation Securities stock at from 98 to 100 on the market when it was being sold to the public at 75 ? " Mr. Salter asked . It is the government 's contention that the stock was " rigged . " " I do n't remember , " Insull replied . " Do you know why he did it ? " Salter insisted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How could I approve ? I knew nothing of it . " " Do you approve of the practice ? " Insull squirmed in his chair . He did not answer . " Let it go , " the prosecutor said finally . Martin 's Role Brought Up . Mr. Salter then attempted to show that in the formation of Utility Investmenito the Insull family turned in securities valued at a much higher price than they had cost . The witness became excited when Mr. Salter wanted to know what part Samuel 's brother , Martin , who is a defendant but is not on trial , had played in the transaction . Insull said he knew nothing of his brother 's affairs . Mr. Salter pressed concerning Corporation Securities , contending that the Insull family 's contribution of securities was at inflated prices . The witness declared the " earning capacity " not the original cost of securities should govern their valuation . " You might as well go back to the Garden of Eden for original costs , " he said angrily . A pointed distinction that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own money , in contrast with the figures he put on the books of his companies . He was asked if he had not made a profit of $1,000,000 in taking up the option to buy Insull Utilities Investment Company stock in 1929 . Mr. Salter showed him the figures and kept at him until he answered : " It would be a profit if it were realized . I ca n't see the profit , however . I just put it in a box . It was merely an exchange of pieces of paper . " Cites 1929 Annual Report . These " pieces of paper , " however , Mr. Salter insisted , when represented in other transactions and in annual reports , became real money to the public . He called attention to the annual report of 1929 . " You were planning to sell more stock that year to the public ? " " Yes . " " And organization expenses of $1,000,000 had been charged to capital surplus ? " " Yes . " - " If that had been charged against earnings would it not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypothetical question . I was not brought up in that school of accounting . " " Answer yes or no , " demanded the prosecutor . Mr. Insull turned to the judge . " When a question is asked that I know is intended to give the wrong impression to the jury , must I answer yes or no ? " he appealed . " You may answer , then give your explanation , " said the court . " Yes , " said Insull . " But I can not conceive of any accountant in his right mind making up an income account on that basis . This is correct accounting , in my judgment . It is perfectly proper . " Later he was again appealing to the court to protect him from " double-barreled questions intended to stultify my previous answers . " In questioning concerning the $86,803,103 recorded in the annual report , he was asked if stock given there at a value of $15,000,000 had not cost but $3,500,000 . The report said that stocks were put in at cost . " I probably made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price , " Insull finally admitted . " It was written up to $31,000,000 , was n't it ? " " I do n't know , sir . " Approved of Practice . He said that he " decidedly approved " of the writing in of stock dividends as income at market price . " If this had been eliminated there never would have been any profit , would there ? " asked the prosecutor . " There is just as much reason to exclude interest and other items . " " Why not answer my question ? " " Because it is misleading . " " You were trying to mislead the public ? " " No , sir , " shouted the witness . " No , sir , we were not . " He was asked about his overriding the opinion of Arthur Young &; Co. that this method of bookkeeping was not sound . The witness admitted that he had had conferences on the subject and that the auditors had changed their minds . " If this had not been done there would have been a loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think that is true . " Insull , on resuming the stand this morning , appeared tired . Under the questioning of Mr. Thompson he said that he had supported the market in the stocks of his investment companies in 1930 and 1931 to provide orderly trading . With his associates he stood " between the market and extreme demoralization , " he declared . He Recounts Rumors . He told of the rumors that persisted in 1930 and 1931 that he was in financial difficulties and that he had offended J. P. Morgan by entering the Eastern utility field . " They were out to do me up , were the reports , " Insull testified , " and these things were n't doing the market any good . These . false reports gained tremendous circulation and it was necessary to support the market in our stocks . " , There were rumors , too , about his health , Insult declared . " One time when I was going to Europe in 1931 , " he said , " there was a report at Southampton that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buried . " There was a burst of laughter in the court room . Insull , apparently gratified at his showmanship , smiled at his lawyer and waited for the next question . The cross-examination will continue tomorrow .
