txt Municipal history was made yesterday when the Board of Estimate appropriated $5,000,000 for home relief to help alleviate the effects of unemployment , which was referred to as " a major social calamity . " The board broke with its policy of refusing appropriations for home relief after hearing the pleas of Frank J. Taylor , Welfare Commissioner , and a group of officers of the leading private welfare agencies , who asserted that public and private relief funds would fall far short of meeting the needs of the army of destitute unemployed . The board was enabled to circumvent the city charter provision against home relief by the Wicks bill , which permits such public relief in the form of food , shelter , light , fuel , clothing and medical attendance . Approximately 40 per cent of the disbursement made yesterday , or about $2,000,000 , will be returned to the city by the State . Following the board 's action , to which only Frank J. Prial , Deputy Controller , dissented , Mr. Taylor announced that the Home Relief Bureau would be ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a central organization for the entire city with branches in the various boroughs , will be administered by the Department of Welfare , with the cooperation of a committee of the group on coordination of the Welfare Council . Central headquarters are at 10 East Thirty-fourth Street . An application bureau will be established in each of the eighty police precincts , but not in police stations . Under the resolution adopted , the bulk of the funds would be made available in January , February and March , when the need is expected to be greatest . The money is to be allocated as follows : December , $300,000 ; January , $1.200,000 ; February , $1 , - 200,000 ; March , $1,200,000 ; April , $800,000 , and May , $300,000 . Mayor Scouts Fear of " Scandals . " Mr. Prial said he had voted in the negative at the request of Controller Berry and because of " scandals in the past . " Mayor Walker , who presided , declared he had no apprehension of scandals , as " most scandals were in the headlines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taylor is in charge of this work , " we can have the fullest confidence in the undertaking , " the Mayor declared . Mr. Prial then said he had meant no reflection on the Welfare Commissioner . Joseph V. , president of the Board of Aldermen , in announcing he would vote in the affirmative , said he believed the city was facing " a major social calamity , " and declared that those disbursing the funds had the faith and confidence of the administration . He wished , however , to dispel the idea that the city had opened its treasury for unlimited relief funds . Mr. Taylor explained that the system under which the funds would be distributed would provide that the money be spent locally to assist storekeepers as well as the needy , who would receive food tickets . Agents of the Health , Police and Welfare De- partments would check and supervise the working out of the plan to safeguard the city and those requiring relief . Others who spoke were William Hodson , executive director of the Welfare Council ; Solomon Lowenstein , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bryant of the Catholic Charities , William Matthews of the Emergency Work Bureau and Lawson Purdy of the Charity Organization Society . Mr. Hodson , who said the 55,000.000 city appropriation was " absolutely necessary , ' explained in detail the relief burdens borne by the family welfare societies and other agencies .
