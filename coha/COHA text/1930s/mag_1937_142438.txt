" In these days of changing social , economic and political values , " Sears , Roebuck 's President Robert E. Wood wrote to stockholders last week , " it seems worth while in this annual report ... to render an account of your management 's stewardship , not merely from the viewpoint of financial reports , but also along the lines of those general broad social responsibilities which can not be presented mathematically . " Mathematically for the No. 1 U. S. mail order house , 1936 scarcely could have been better . Sears enjoyed the best year in its history . So did its older and smaller rival , Montgomery Ward &; Co. , which reported to stockholders fortnight ago . <P> Sears ' sales in 1936 rose to $495,000,000 , a 26% increase over the previous year . +Ward's1936 sales were $361,300,000 , up 23% . Net profits reported by Sears were $30,660,000 , a 43% increase over $21,519,000 reported in 1935 . On a percentage basis Ward did even better , lifting its profits 49% from $13,527,000 to $20,199,000 . Both companies paid out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid the undistributed profits tax and both did financing during the fiscal year to obtain new capital . <P> To Sears ' precise General Wood and Chairman Lessing Julius Rosenwald the social responsibilities of a great mercantile institution must be practiced as well as preached . Two-thirds of General Wood 's letter to stockholders was devoted to outlining responsibilities : 1 ) to the public ; 2 ) to employes ( 48,200 ) ; 3 ) to stockholders ( 42,700 ) ; 4 ) to Sears ' sources of supplies ( 6,461 manufacturers ) . After pointing with pride to the company 's policy of keeping wages ahead of advancing living costs and providing vacations with pay , General Wood made the first public accounting of Sears ' Employes ' Savings &; Profit Sharing Pension Fund through which the workers have become the largest single stockholding group in Sears , Roebuck &; Co. ( 9.2% ) . Inaugurated in 1916 by the late great Julius Rosenwald , the Fund has paid out $45,204,000 to a total of 65,000 employes who paid in only $10,042,000 . Company contributions and stock dividends completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Fund , which contains $44,206,000 . In 1936 Sears ' dividends paid to the Fund amounted to $2,891,000 , company contributions another $1,700,000 . <P> Like Sears and Ward in that it sells more products than any one person can name is big Union Carbide &; Carbon Corp . ( gases &; organic chemicals , metals &; alloys , batteries ) . Like Sears and Ward , Carbide made more money in 1936 than in any other of its 19 years of corporate existence . Net profits were $36,852,000 , a 35% increase over 1935 . Noting that prosperity was in Carbide 's every pore , President Jesse Jay Ricks last week wrote to 55,705 stockholders : " The quantity of oxygen sold in 1936 exceeded that of any previous year . . . . More motorists bought ' Eveready Prestone ' antifreeze . . . . Alloy sales to the steel industry exceeded in volume those of any previous year . " Also noted with pride by President Ricks was that $20,000,000 worth of new plant construction in 1936 had been financed out of current assets .
