txt Temporary postponement of war-debt payments by countries unable to pay and revision where advisable , conditional upon reductions in armaments and compensatory trade advantages , were advocated by a special committee of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States in ' a report made public today . Cancellation was strongly opposed . Presented as " a business man 's viewpoint as- to what should be the fair and wise course for the United States to follow with regard to the debts , " the report set forth that " if the United States makes further adjustment of the terms of the settlements with European debtor , tevernments such adjustments must not throw the undiminished tax burden upon the American taxpayer . " The committee 's conclusions were contained in the following recom-mendations : 1 ? Further postponement of payments should be authorized on a temporary basis in the case ! , of those debtor countries showing inability to make present payments. , 2 ? Upon a debtor country showing material change in the bases of the existing debt agreement , the United States Government should negotiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Statek 3 ? The best interests of the United States require that any modification should be conditioned upon definite provisions for such treatment of our trade by the debtor country as will assure access of American goods to its markets on fair competitive terms . 4 ? The best interests of the United States require that any modification should be conditioned upon reduction in expenditures for armaments . 5 ? Proposals for the United States to cancel war debts owed to it by other governments should be re- , jected , Personnel of the Committee . The report was signed by Silas Strawn , former president of the Chamber of Commerce . as chairman of the ' committee ; Julius . H. Barnes , also a termer president of the chamber ; William Butterworth , chairman of the board , Deere &; Co. , Moline , Ill. ; Charles Donnelly , president of the Northern Pacific Railroad , St. Paul ; Henry I. Harriman , president of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States ; Lewis E. Pierson , chairman of the board , Irving Trust Company , New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cincinnati ; H. R. Safford , vice president of the Missouri Pacific Railroad , and Melvin A. Ttaylor , First National Bank , ** The committee presented an exhaustive study of the debt situa1 tion and said that " the war debts as governmental obligations are a disturbing factor in international re1 lations , and settlement of them on a basis that will dispose of them once and for all , atifj keep them from dominating the discussions of interna1 tional questions , should be sought . " ' Agreeing that the necessity of meeting their debt payments had caused foreign nations to throw up trade barriers which worked against expansion of American exports , the report endorsed the theoty of " reasonable " protective ' tariffs on the part of the United States , and held Ithat the " American customs tariff has never proved the complete bar to competitive imports which many have proclaimed it to be . " It agreed , however , that the United - States in " developing its export trade must contemplate likewise expansion , of its import trade . " The " opening of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the committee , would bring about for our people " a further measure of relief which , in amount , can equal or exceed the relief through reduction of armaments . " The report continued : " In our opinion the United States Government , in any further negotiations with foreign debtor countries with reference to adjustment of the debts , should seek such treatment for our trade as to accomplish this purpose . " Urges " Enlightened " Debt Policy . The committee felt that an " enlightened " goverftment policy and program would facilitate payment of the debts and development of world trade . It ** that in 1927 the World Economic Conference " urged the removal of excessive trade restrictions and excessive tariffs " and pointed ' out that we were now on the eve of another such conference . " While not in any degree urging departure from the policy of reasonable protective tariff for the United States , for which the national chamber stands committed , " the report commented , " we would urge in the interest of world recovery and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective cooperation of the United States Government in world ? efforts to remove all unnecessary and excessive barriers to international commerce . " As for the war debts , if economic and social changes had profoundly altered the original bases for such agreements  --  and the committee . expressed the belief that they had ? " further examination of the situation and adjustment of the terms of the agreements are justifiable and to be recommended . " Admitting that It attached " much importance to the maintenance and development of the foreign trade of the United States , " the committee noted the tremendous decrease in this trade since 1929 and said of the possible effect of war-debt payment on our foreign trade : " The committee does not believe that the prospects that payment will necessitate greater imports to balance our exports , our debt receipts and other sums accruing to the United States present such disadvantages to our domestic market as to cause us to forego such receipts .
