txt Following the government 's estimate , issued last Saturday , that the 1931 cotton crop would total 15,584,000 bales , or 1,500,000 bales more than the average of private estimates , prices of cotton futures plunged from 122 to 142 points , or about $7 a bale , at the opening of the New York Cotton Exchange yesterday . The decline brought the October delivery to 6.70 cents a pound , the lowest price for any cotton option since January , 1905 . Later in the session there was a moderate recovery , and closing prices were from 109 to 114 points , or a little more than a cent a pound , lower . The decline at New York had been preceded by the slump of cotton on Saturday on the Chicago Board of Trade , which remained open after the government report was issued . In view of the fact that the price at Chicago had declined 150 points on relatively light trading , there was much misgiving concerning the opening at New York .

Foreign Markets Watched . Before the New York market opened yesterday , interest centred on the ? principal foreign markets at Bremen and Liverpool . Bremen opened 150 points , or 11/2 cents a pound , lower , while the Liverpool market was virtually demoralized , with prices nearly 2 cents a pound lower .

Short ccvering and buying by the cotton trade appeared here after the lower opening , and prices were quickly stabilized , although trading remained unusually heavy . At the lowest prices yesterday the October delivery was exactly 4 cents a pound lower than the high point reached on the rally at the end of June which accompanied President Hoover 's suggestion for a moratorium on war debts .

Many cotton authorities declared yesterday that they felt the government 's estimate of a yield of 185.8 pounds an acre  --  the largest acre yield since the World War  --  was unduly optimistic , in view of the fact that there had been a reduction of from 25 to 30 per cent in the use of fertilizer . Persistent rains in Central and Eastern States were likely to reduce the crop through unusual boll weevil damage , the authorities said . Other experts , however ; pointed out that the government report had taken the latter factor into consideration in cutting the yield forecast for the Central and Eastern States by more than 300,000 bales compared with last year , while the yield of Texas , Oklahoma and Arkansas had been increased more than 2,000,000 bales , as a result of the absence of the drought that affected last year 's crop in the latter States .
