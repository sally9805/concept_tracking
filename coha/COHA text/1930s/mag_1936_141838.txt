On the west bank of the broad estuary of the Kennebec River is Bath , Me. , " City of Ships . " There in 1607 was launched the first ship built in North America . There Jonathan Philbrook gained immortality by building the first schooner . There for more than a century was the centre of the U. S. shipbuilding industry . But in Bath today there is only one active shipyard-the famed Bath Iron Works . Hitherto a tightly-held little company , Bath Iron Works last week became a publicly-owned corporation . A banking group headed by Manhattan 's Hemphill , Noyes &; Co. offered 50,000 shares of new Bath Iron Works stock together with 144,000 shares previously outstanding and owned by the principal stockholders . <P> Founded in 1889 by Maine 's General Thomas Worcester Hyde , Bath Iron Works has had an erratic record . It nearly went under in 1895 when an experimental armored ram built for the Navy failed to develop the speed required . The firm was saved by a special Act of Congress which authorized the craft 's acceptance on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficiencies . A few years later Bath Iron Works was sold to Charles Michael Schwab 's U. S. Shipbuilding Co. , which sold it back to General Hyde 's son in 1905 . At the top of the Wartime ship-building boom the Hydes again sold out , a move which proved very smart indeed , for by 1925 Bath Iron Works was closed down tight . It stayed closed , except for a brief period of use as a fibre goods plant , until 1927 . Then it was taken over by William Stark Newell , a seasoned shipbuilder who had done a turn in the Bath Iron Works as a riveter during a summer vacation from Massachusetts Institute of Technology , worked up to works manager . <P> Bath Iron Works 's 1927 rejuvenation coincided with the lushest yacht-building era in U. S. history . First big contract was a 240-ft. job for Ernest Blaney Dane of Brookline , Mass . Hiram Edward Manville 's 266-ft . Hi-Esmaro was built by Bath Iron Works .

Morgan 's fourth Corsair , which was launched in the dark days of 1930 amid a fusillade of anonymous letters threatening to dynamite the 343-ft. ship before she left the ways . <P> Only yacht on the Bath Iron Works future books at present is Harold Stirling Vanderbilt 's new America 's Cup defense candidate , the keel of which was poured last week . With the passing of the golden days of yacht building , Bath Iron Works struggled along with Coast Guard and Lighthouse Service contracts together with an occasional commercial job until President Newell learned how to get Navy work in 1932 . Since then Bath Iron Works has delivered three destroyers including the Lamson , now the fastest ship in the U. S. Navy . Navy Department contracts account for more than $21,000,000 of the $22,000,000 worth of orders Bath Iron Works has on hand . <P> Navy work , though the profits are now limited to 10% , is considerably more satisfactory than commercial shipbuilding , which often shows a loss .
