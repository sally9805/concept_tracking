Put on the market a few years ago by famed old Parker Bros . Inc. was a game called Monopoly , ingeniously designed to appeal to the baldest acquisitive instincts . It was an instantaneous success . Last week President Roosevelt , from motives as mixed as they were imperative , dusted off an older and political form of Monopoly which has been played by successive Administrations with varying degrees of enthusiasm for upward of half a century . <P> The late John Davison Rockefeller made the country monopoly-conscious in the kerosene days of old Standard Oil Co. , the most effective private monopoly ever developed in the U. S. Roosevelt I raised trust-busting to prime issue of his time . In the roaring 1920s the subject was seldom mentioned except by such old-school Progressives as George Norris and William Borah , and even in the first four years of the New Deal trust-busting languished . Meantime the form of Big Business changed from the monopolistic trust to the domination of an industry by a group of potent corporations . Monopoly , the market of one seller , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market of the few . <P> Shrewdly President Roosevelt let others launch his attack on oligopoly , dispatching lieutenants to rostrum and microphone . Politicians suspected that all this was a build-up for a similar attack of his own . presumably to be delivered in his Jackson Day dinner speech this coming week . Opening shot was fired in a broadcast last fortnight by another Jackson , who happens to be head of the Department of Justice 's anti-trust division-Assistant Attorney General Robert Houghwout J ackson . Bob Jackson , who is reputedly being groomed as the next Democratic Governor of New York State , last week followed his first attack with another delivered before the American Political Science Association in Philadelphia . Next day in Washington , Secretary of Interior Ickes stepped to a microphone with a fighting speech which looked as if it had been tempered on the same anvil as Bob Jackson 's . <P> Jackson . Describing the philosophy of Big Business in Goethe 's phrase as " Aristocratic Anarchy , " describing the present Recession in the words of Sir Arthur Salter , famed British economist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political action which it fears and dislikes , " Bob Jackson declared : <P> " It has always been my belief that this generation would do better to get the best out of its existing system rather than to urge theoretical systems . . . . The only agency with the power to condition capitalism and industrialism to survive is the Government . To this end I have supported , in general , the program of reform called the New Deal , with far more doubts about its adequacy than about its moderation . " <P> On prices : " Prices are no longer determined by the law of supply &; demand in many basic industries . There is no way on earth to regulate the economic oligarchy of autocratic , self-constituted and self- perpetuating groups . ... " <P> On opportunity : " Parents labor and save to provide formal educations for their children and when that education is finished there is no place for the boy or girl to go except to start at the bottom of an impossibly long ladder of a few great corporations dominated by America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
