Because it feels " immediate extraordinary measures are imperative in order to enable the railroads to continue in the passenger business , " the Interstate Commerce Commission last week announced its most drastic decision since 1920 . It ordered all U. S. railroads to reduce present basic fares of 3.6 a mile in coaches and 3.6 a mile plus 50% surcharge in Pullmans to a maximum rate of 2 a mile in coaches and 3 a mile in Pullmans . Pullman surcharges are to be abolished . Effective date : June 2 , 1936 . <P> Unlike the recent revision of classes on transatlantic liners , which was a change in name without much effect on rates ( TIME , Feb. 17 ) , the new railroad fares will make a tremendous difference in the cost of travel . A salesman scooting about the nation in trains now pays $32.70 for a day-coach ticket or $41.70 in a Pullman from New York to Chicago . According to the new rates , he will pay only $18.17 in a coach or $27.24 in a Pullman . To ride from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $11.17 but $8.83 . A day coach next afternoon to Indianapolis will cost $5.04 instead of $8.87 . <P> Based on a two-year study , the ICC decision was handed down by a 5-4 vote , with two Commissioners absent . Bitterly contested by the minority , the 80-page decision declared : <P> 1 ) Railroad passenger traffic and revenue have declined steadily since 1923 . While rail passenger-miles fell from 47 billion in 1920 to 16 billion in 1933 , high-way passenger-miles rose from 28 to 191 billion . <P> 2 ) Only lines since 1933 to show improvement in passenger traffic and revenue are the Southern carriers which have tried an emergency rate of 1 a mile , the Western carriers which have tested 2 a mile . <P> 3 ) " The passenger market . . . looks as promising as at any time in the history of the country , " but the railroads can not share it unless they cut rates to meet the cheapness of highway travel and the reduced economic condition of the U. S. <P> 4 ) Improved service and facilities , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " success . Principal remaining remedy is reduction of fare . <P> 5 ) The Pullman surcharge is so distasteful to the public it causes more harm than good to the lines . <P> 6 ) Extra fares on de luxe trains are still desirable . <P> 7 ) In the South and West , improved traffic and revenue are due to reduction , not to better business conditions . <P> 8 ) Circumstances in the East are substantially the same . <P> No one really knew last week what the effect of the new rates will be . In general , the railroads welcomed the reduction . Only the New York , New Haven &; Hartford , Pennsylvania and New York Central actively opposed it . Greyhound Corp . stock dropped six points . Almost everywhere present bus rates will still be lower than the new rail rates .
