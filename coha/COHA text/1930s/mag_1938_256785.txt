Britain 's dynamic , ambitious War Secretary , Leslie Hore-Belisha , who last year put through a tradition-shattering shake-up of the Regular Army , last week suddenly announced complete reorganization of the nation 's home defense force , the 200,000-man volunteer Territorial Army . <P> The Territorials , familiarly known as the " Terriers , " roughly correspond to U.S. National Guardsmen . They have charge of Britain 's antiaircraft and coastal defenses , the balloon barrages ( rows of sausage-shaped gas bags , suspending thin , steel cables , which will be anchored to truck-winches and floated above the industrial centres in wartime ) and emergency hospital work . In a decision , long expected and accelerated by the recent war scare , the War Secretary announced that the Terriers from now on will be patterned after the Regular Army . They will retain their antiaircraft and other duties , but four divisions will be mechanized , equipped with more warlike teeth : light and heavy machine guns , anti-tank guns and tanks . <P> Main drawback to Hore-Belisha 's scheme to mechanize and equip this reorganized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still-lagging rearmament program , even the Regular Army is not adequately supplied with heavy machine guns , anti-tank and antiaircraft devices , and observers are of the opinion that it will be many months before sufficient arms can be spared for the Terriers . <P> A National Guardsman enlists for three years , a Terrier for four . As in the U.S. , a Terrier spends two weeks a year in camp , attends 20-45 one-hour drills per year . Chief difference between the U.S. and British organizations is a British War Office ruling , except in wartime or during their annual training period , that the Terriers can not be called up to deal with civil disturbances .
