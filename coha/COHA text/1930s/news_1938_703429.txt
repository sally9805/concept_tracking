txt President 's Course Upheld Effort to Elect Liberal Candidates to - Congress Approved To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : President Roosevelt 's announcement in his latest nation-wide broadcast that he is interested in electing liberal candidates to Congress and the Senate is referred to in the press as a " purge . " Our government has its roots in the English system of democracy . The President has been recognized by students of government on both continents as embodying the duties of the British Prime Minister plus something more . In fact , British democracy is just a step closer to the people than ours . When the Prime Minister is defeated on any question of paramount policy in the House of Commons he has the right to go to the people  --  to dissolve the House of Commons , call a general election and let the people speak . By this token , the President would have had the right to go to the country when his Court Reform Bill was defeated . Had he done so , it is well recognized that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reliable polls indicate this . Under our system he could not go to the country immediately , but could do so at the next election . This is exactly what he is doing . Furthermore , under our American system all of our great Presidents have considered themselves as representing the entire nation and as being the head of the dominant political party and they have always fought for their policies in the Congress and in the Congressional elections . Tins was true of Teddy Roosevelt , of Woodrow Wilson and of Abraham Lincoln . While the President has been successful , without going to the country in his Supreme Court policy , yet his whole system of liberal thought and action is at stake , and it is his duty to let the country know what the situation is and to decide whether we shall go forward or back . Our best authorities on constitutional law recognize that the President is not only Chief Executive but chief legislator . Those who maintain that the President should not interfere with Congress or Congressional elections should remember what Woodrow Wilson , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution , says in support of the proposition that the President should lead in matters legislative : " No living thing can have its organs offset against each other as checks and live . On the contrary , its life is dependent upon their quick cooperation , their ready response to the commands of instinct or intelligence . ? * * Their cooperation is indispensable , their warfare fatal . There can be no successful government without leadership or without the intimate , almost instinctive , coordination of the organs of life and action . " FRANK 3 . BURNS .

Pessimistic About Taxes Local Levies , in Particular , Are Cause of One Citizen 's Complaint To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YoRK TIMEs : L Mayor La Guardia need not be envious of Governor Lehman 's record in creating a surplus out of a deficit remaining during Roosevelt 's term of office . The method of balancing a budget by excessive taxation retards business and is no incentive to make additional investment of capital . Almost from the moment Mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taxation but of legal confiscation . The occupancy tax is the latest form of raising funds ; the next may be a radio tax , or perhaps a tax for being alive . When the city budget will be balanced or result in a surplus , our Mayor , like Governor Lehman , will take credit , when as a matter of fact the results were created through nothing less than confiscation , of taxpayers ' property plus assistance from the Federal Government . President Roosevelt could do a great deal for the big and little taxpayer if he would sponsor a bill for conducting a national lottery , the proceeds to be divided among the States , who in turn will distribute the amount to the various cities . Incidentally , if the New York World 's Fair is unsuccessful , the taxpayers had better prepare to set up a fund for additional taxes to meet the deficit . It is my guess they will need it . As long as we will continue to have thirteen to sixteen million unemployed , the present ruling powers will continue in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxation . LOUIS MARDER . New York , July 15 , 1938 . And the Occupancy Tax To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YoRK TIMES : The City Collector is employing the police to distribute blanks and aid in collecting the latest tax  --  the occupancy tax . There is something un-American about this whole business . The police force should not be used to collect taxes . It is a page borrowed from the Nazi or Fascist nations . Page by page , we will soon have the whole book , with the covers . There are other means of tax-blank distribution . The police are overworked as it is . We are underpoliced and overtaxed . Also , only three days were allowed between receiving the blank and the due date of the tax . This points to another Fascist-like piece of work on the part of the tax-hungry authorities . We are now paying a city gross tax of $1 per thousand gross business for the " privilege " of doing business , plus 5 per cent . per month if we are late in paying same . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of staying indoors in order to do business in order to pay a gross business tax , or rather a preliminary tax to a bigger tax . M. D. LITMAN . New York , July 14 , 1938 . " Feel ' Em , No See ' Em " To THE EDITOR or THE NEW YORK TIMES : All taxes restrict production and trade , some much more , some somewhat less . Processing taxes , license taxes  --  you do n't see their effects but they are there . Some , like the tobacco tax , you do n't see even the tax itself ; others , like the sales taxes . which are cumulative , the poor consumer sees , sometimes , the last turn of the screw . BOLTON HALL . New York , July 13 , 1938 . South 's Economic Troubles They Are , It Is Declared , Due Largely to Cotton and the Tariff To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : A well-conditioned export market for cotton means an annual average revenue of $600,000,000 from exports alone to 2,000,000 cotton farm families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the United States was a world debtor and when balances due abroad were paid in exports by the United States . The United States is now a world creditor . It owes no one abroad . In. order to sell for export it must buy for import . But the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act stands as a barrier . Its schedules are so high that Mr. Hull has difficulty in effecting reciprocal trade treaties . This in the face of the fact that a surplusproducing , world creditor country vitally needs low costs of production and open trade channels . The economic troubles in the South are the direct result of the national policies relating to cotton , and they can not be solved in any other way than by obedience by the United States to the rules applicable to a surplus-producing world-creditor country . Yet Mr. Roosevelt 's economic conference on Southern affairs did not mention cotton at all . That conference can get nowhere unless and until it recognizes and deals with the true cause of the South 's economic distress . WALTER PARKER . New Orleans , La. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The New York Women 's League for Animals is asking its friends to aid it in opening a few more free watering stations in this city , to meet the needs of the horses that must work in our , streets through the hot Summer weather . Horses must drink in all seasons , but it is through July and August that the need is greatest , and lack of water means not only suffering but often death . Even in this motorized age some 30 , - 000 horses are employed here , and the municipality provides no drinking facilities for them . The league 's stations , which vary from ten or twelve in the Winter to fifteen or so in Summer , are open from 8 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon , and many hundreds of horses drink from their pails each day . Will the friends - who are willing to contribute toward opening - additional stations in traffic districts that are now " dry " please send their gifts to me at the Ellin Prince Speyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. ) GEORGE BETHUNE ADAM .

Bishop Paddock Excepts To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES William Carney , in Tixx TIMES today , in an interview with Americans held as prisoners by the Insurgents , quotes them as saying that " the organization known as the American Friends of Spanish Democracy was simply ' a propaganda outfit ' connected somehow with the United States Communists because party members were on its office staff , but it never did any actual recruiting . " This committee has no connection with the Communist party nor any political organization . It happens that a technical worker in our office , 22 years old , is a member of the Young Communist League . I need hardly say that she has no voice in the determination of our policies . Her politics were not considered when she was employed as a typist and file clerk . ( Right Rev. ) ROBERT L. PADDOCK , Chairman , American Friends of Spanish Democracy . New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The Bureau of City Collections has been confronted with a serious problem ever since the sales tax has been in effect . For a period of two weeks before each due date the offices of the City Collector are crowded with taxpayers who need assistance in filing their sales tax returns and with those making cash payments . These individuals consist chiefly of those who pay not more than $10 . The procedure tends to tie up the offices of the City Collector , and makes it very difficult to secure information without delay . To relieve this congestion I suggest that the present law be changed so as to permit those taxpayers paying less than $10 to file returns annually instead of quarterly . EUGENE L. WINSTON .
