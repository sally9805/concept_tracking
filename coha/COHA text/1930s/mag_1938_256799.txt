Ever since Manhattan became Bagdad-on-the-Subway 34 years ago , lusty Chicago has toyed with the idea of an underground of its own . But despite years of fantastic traffic messes , civic pounding , editorial urging and earnest planning , Chicago is still the biggest city in the world without a passenger subway . <P> More than 75% of Chicago 's passenger traffic is handled by a vast system of street cars and busses . Chief rapid transit the city proper has is furnished by its far-flung 41-year-old elevated railway system , 14 lines that creep and clang counterclockwise around the " Loop " encircling the 7 by 6-block financial and mercantile district before heading back toward the city 's outskirts . Inside the " Loop , " the property values are as high as the 45-story Field Building ; outside they fall off just as steeply . <P> Most of Chicago 's subway schemes have proposed leveling the elevated loop and the uneven scale of property values it sustains . Successfully opposing such plans have been the real-estate and business interests entrenched inside the " Loop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the " Loop " was on its way to fulfillment . Signed by President Roosevelt was a PWA allotment of 18 million lend-spend dollars , representing 45% of the cost of a $40,000,000 7.6-mile subway system which Chicago must start building before January 1 , and must have substantially completed by June 30 , 1940 . To be tunneled at a depth of 35 feet through the stratum of blue clay underlying Chicago 's 25 feet of largely-filled in elevation above Lake Michigan , its two lines will lead from existing " L " trackage on the North Side , shortcutting some trains into the " Loop " from outlying areas with time savings of as much as 16 to 20 minutes , and bringing rapid transit for the first time to the busy Milwaukee Avenue industrial district . In the " Loop " itself the lines will run under Dearborn and State Streets , a block apart , with communicating passenger tunnels connecting their continuous platforms at seven consecutive " Loop " streets . Effect of the system when promised unification of Chicago 's transit lines is achieved will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible a reduction in number of overhead trains , and to relieve congested street cars and bus lines in the newly tapped districts .
