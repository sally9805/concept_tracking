txt Will Rogers Waits to See What New Year Will Bring To the Editor of The New York Times : SANTA MONICA , Calif. , Dec. 31 . ? Well , the old year will be passing out in a few hours , and I do n't know personally of a thing that I can do about it . I guess there will be a lot of people will take it up with the government , as they look to them to do everything else . I have received in pamphlet and small book forms several plans to prolong the old year . They all say if they can just get their plans adopted that it will do the work . Of course the question arises as to whether it has been a year that the brain trusters want to prolong . I have no doubt they have schemes to do it , so we will have to just wait till tomorrow to see if they have done it . Yours , WILL ROGERS .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
