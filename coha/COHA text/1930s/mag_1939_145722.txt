Last week at Santa Monica , Calif. , Douglas Aircraft Co. test-flew a new ship , turned its back on the design trend which in the past five years has put low-wing monoplanes on every large domestic airline in the U. S. Not since the last famed Ford " tin goose " and Fokker tri-motor disappeared from service had a high-wing monoplane like Douglas ' new DC-5 , which carries 16 passengers and uses a retractable tricycle landing gear , been offered for transport service . <P> When weatherbeaten Carl Cover , Doug las vice president and boss test pilot , " poured the coal " to the DC-5 's two 750-horsepower Pratt &; Whitney Hornets , the new ship , designed primarily for operation out of short fields on feeder lines , whipped off the field like a barnstormer 's pasture-hopper . In the air it showed a high speed of 248 miles an hour , a cruising speed of 203 , far better than the conservative Douglas performance estimates . Pleased was Pilot Cover ( who is in charge of sales ) with other features of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more have an unobstructed view of the ground ; the ship , low-hung , can be loaded with passengers and freight without the use of a ramp ; mechanics can get to its engines for minor adjustment from the ground without using stands . Also important : the high-wing construction lessens the hazard of wingtip stalling at low speeds to which some low-wing jobs are prone . <P> Less pleased were Mr. Cover and his boss , President Donald Wills Douglas , with the sales potentialities of DC-5 's big , four-motored brother DC-4 , now completed at a reputed development cost of $2,400,000 . <P> Three years ago the five big U. S. airlines chipped in towards development of the ship , agreed to buy none like it for 18 months . Since then T. W. A. and Pan American have ordered Boeing four-motored 307 's and other lines appear to have cooled in their enthusiasm for the biggest Douglas , reputedly because of high operation costs . Last week United Air Lines ' crack Pilot Benny Howard was at Santa Monica getting acquainted with the DC-4 , intended at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. 's system to see what could be done with it .
