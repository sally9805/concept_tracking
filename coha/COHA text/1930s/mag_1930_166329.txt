A hired champion who defends his client right or wrong-such is the usual concept of a lawyer . Far different was the concept set up in Rome last week by Signor Alfredo Rocco , reverberant-voiced Minister of Justice , drafter of the new Italian Penal Code ( TIME , Oct. 28 ) . <P> " In the eyes of Fascismo , " boomed Signor Rocco with an eagle-like fixation of his own terrifying optics , " In the eyes of Fascismo an attorney , even though retained under fee by a client , still owes his first duty to the State ! He must hasten Justice and make it sure , even against the wishes or the interests of his client . He must control the exposition of facts related to him by the client and gather the elements of proof into an honored sequence , so that when the trial begins it can move speedily to a decision . There must be no emotional pleading , no such disgrace to Justice as what the American 's call ' sob stuff . ' "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
