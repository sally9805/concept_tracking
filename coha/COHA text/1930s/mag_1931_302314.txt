With the first frost , the Zuni , Navajo and Mescalero Apache Indians of New Mexico go out to harvest the little piion nuts which grow on stubby pines atop the two great mesas , Cerro Alto and Santa Rita , close to the Continental Divide . For the past three years the crop has been scant , but such a yield was promised this year that the Navajos quit hammering silver and weaving blankets in anticipation of selling tons of piion nuts at 5 to 10 per lb . Last month 1,000 Navajos and 300 Zunis went a-nutting in small canvas-covered wagons . When the Zuni men had their wives and children established on the nutting grounds they returned to their fields . Navajo braves stayed with the womenfolk . <P> Early in Thanksgiving week the bright New Mexican sky suddenly darkened . The white men 's thermometers fell far below Zero . Before nightfall snow had banked five ft. high across the down trails from Cerro Alto and Santa Rita mesas , where the nutters were camped . Within a few days the Indians ' small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ icy blast . Families crouched over small fires or cowered in the protection of their thin canvas wagon tops . It was decided that as many as possible should take the weakened ponies down to the Zuni settlement near Gallup , there strengthen them and bring them back . Three hundred braves trudged into the Zuni pueblos last week , dropped exhausted on the warm earthen floors . As soon as they were informed of the peril of their red-skinned charges , U. S. Indian agents organized rescue parties , made off for the snow-bound mesas . At the end of the week 789 had been rescued or had straggled home alone . But 200 more piion nut-hunters presumably subsisting on pony meat were still unaccounted for ; eleven were found frozen , dead .
