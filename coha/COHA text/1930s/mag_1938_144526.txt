" No optimistic view of the future is warranted , " said Foreign Minister Koki Hirota in Tokyo last week in a warning to the Japanese people to " prepare for possible extreme personal financial sacrifices . " <P> Returning to Japan from his naval command in Chinese waters , Vice Admiral Kiyoshi Hasegawa , whom the confident Japanese expected to announce new victories , tersely remarked : " The war is only half over ! " <P> As a final indication of how serious a turn-for Japan-the ten-months-old undeclared Chinese-Japanese War has taken , Premier Prince Fumimaro Konoye partly invoked the much debated , bitterly opposed National Mobilization Act , providing for immediate mobilization of Japanese man power and resources . When this bill was passed in March , Prince Konoye placated Japanese political parties by promising that the act would be implemented only in case of emergency . <P> News trickling through from neutral and Chinese sources gave reasons for this Japanese loss of optimism and growing sense of desperate action . Although no clear-cut Chinese victory , such as the Taierhchwang capture last month , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unprecedented , coordinated military action in a series of minor successes throughout virtually the entire war area . <P> The main battle of the war last week was still being fought northeast of Suchow , from 15 to 50 miles north of the eastern end of the Lunghai Railway . Into an area more than half the size of Long Island , General Li Tsung-jen , commander-in-chief of the Fifth War Area , had poured about 650,000 Chinese soldiers for what six months ago would have been a real anomaly-a Chinese offensive . Opposing them were 100,000 well-trained , well-armed Japanese troops . <P> No frontal advance on Japanese entrenched positions was ordered by General Li Tsung-jen , but rather a series of sweeping side attacks , each more intense than the other , each spaced to give the Japanese scant time to recuperate from the last . The Chinese general hoped by these tactics to wear down the Japanese forces so that a general retreat would be ordered . <P> Coordinated with the Chinese offensive was a far-flung guerilla warfare rivaling any irregular fighting for scope and intensity yet experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory seemed to be free from the guerillas . The Nanking-Shanghai area , well within Japanese lines , was declared unsafe . At Taiping , between Nanking and Wuhu , Chinese bands infiltrated into the city and fought the small Japanese garrison in the streets . Just north of Shanghai , almost due east of Nanking , at Tungchow , the none-too-modest Japanese communiques claimed their only major success of the week-the de-feat of 10,000 Chinese attempting to cut off this important base from other Japanese-controlled points .
