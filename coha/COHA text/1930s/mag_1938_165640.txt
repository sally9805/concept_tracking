Once a year , in mid-August , the sleepy little village of Goshen , N. Y. becomes for a day the capital of the harness-racing world . There , along elm-shaded streets that were meant for its population of 4,000 , 40,000 trotting-race enthusiasts , in carnival spirit , meander toward Good Time Track and the running of the Hambletonian , world 's richest race for trotting horses . <P> The assorted collection of city folks who go to Goshen as a last resort of horse &; buggy days will remember last week 's Hambletonian as the one with the best weather . But to seasoned trotting men , the story of Lawrence Sheppard 's master stroke of horse trading will serve as a subject of discussion for many a dull winter evening . <P> Lawrence Sheppard is a rich shoemaker ( Hanover Shoes ) who owns one of the finest standard-bred stud farms ( Hanover Shoe Farms ) in the U. S. Twice winner of the Hambletonian ( Hanover 's Bertha in 1930 and Shirley Hanover in 1937 ) , Shoemaker Sheppard , like most rich sportsmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first owner to take the event twice in a row . Because he had no likely prospect , as he went the rounds of the Grand Circuit this summer Horse Owner Sheppard kept one eye on his own stable , the other on his fellow horsemen 's . At Agawam three weeks ago , he saw William Cane 's Hambletonian entry , McLin , outstep the highly touted Long Key in the third heat of the American Stake ( after a miserable showing in the two previous heats ) . As quick as a man could say David Harum , Owner Sheppard offered Owner Cane $20,000 for McLin , had him hitched to a Hanover sulky the following week . <P> With just eight days to get accustomed to his new charge , who was notorious for his bad temper and fondness for breaking from racing stride into a gallop . Driver Henry Thomas , one of the sturdiest and smartest in the game , thought he had McLin ready on Hambletonian Day . Seasoned horsemen , however , knowing that McLin had never finished in the money as a two-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether even foxy , strong-fingered Henry Thomas could handle him . At the end of the first one-mile heat , when McLin , trotting in faultless gait , came home three lengths in front , railbirds fancied they might be wrong . At the end of the second heat they saluted a great horse . McLin had won in straight heats ( 2:02 , 2:02 ) . To Owner Sheppard went $19,944 , just $56 less than the amount he had paid Bill Cane the week before .
