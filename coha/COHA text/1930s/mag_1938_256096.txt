Germany 's large - scale mobilization which began August 15-dubbed " maneuvers " by the Third Reich 's General Staff - was officially called off last week . In garrisons at Berlin , Frankfurt am Main , Mainz , Frth and Knigsberg at least 450,000 youthful reservists , happy that their Fhrer Adolf Hitler had got all he wanted of Czechoslovakia without losing a man , were in high spirits as they made ready to return to civilian life November 1 . <P> Many requisitioned busses bringing flower-bedecked soldiers back to Berlin from Sudetenland were inscribed : " The War is Over ! " Also released to civilian life were the Labor Service youths , detained an extra month to work on Germany 's counter-Maginot line facing France . These fortifications , heretofore called by U. S. correspondents the Siegfried Line , were last week officially christened Limes* by the Fhrer himself . <P> For German Jews there was little rejoicing . They were being examined last week preparatory to the name-changing on January 1 . All Jews born after that date must be labeled with an unmistakably Jewish first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men whose present names differ from those on the list must now add Israel , Jewish women must tag on Sarah . Reported by many correspondents as also planned for the New Year by Germany 's rampant anti-Semitic rulers was a more-drastic-than-ever decree forbidding Jews to work for Aryans , to own or work in factories , banks , wholesale houses . For the Third Reich 's 500,000 Jews , half on relief , the new decree will mean certain pauperdom . <P> *Latin word pronounced lee-mace , meaning crossroad , limit , boundary , passage . Limes Germanicus , built in the First Century A.D. from the Rhine to the Danube , was a series of forts to keep the Teuton barbarians out of the Roman Empire .
