txt Vichy as a Music Center Selection of French Resort Is Pictured As Logical Move To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The letter of Louis Rittenberg in THE TIMES of Dec. 28 calls for an answer . I have spent many years in France and consider myself reasonably well informed on the status of liberty , equality and fraternity there , and I am convinced that the Republic of France under the leadership of M. Daladier can call forth expressions only of respect , admiration and confidence from the citizens of other democracies . In the last few months France has shown the unquenchable spirit of her democracy and her readiness to gird herself with steel to defend these ideals . Her continuance as a great democracy is foregone , for France is a country where the principles of democratic freedom are still the richest heritage that can be handed down by the peasant landowners ( in the majority in France ) to future generations of Frenchmen . To assume that France or England will " teeter " while America goes victoriously forward is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international music center has been the result of no accidental gain from political prejudice . It is the natural outcome of its having for many years presented artistic , well-balanced , discriminating programs of music which have attracted music lovers from the whole wide world . For more than a hundred years people from every corner of the globe have been coming to Vichy for its social and recreational pleasures as well as for its famous cure . Its cultural environment and ' geographical location in one of the few democracies left for music lovers of America or any other country make it a logical international center of music . New York City has its delightful Lewissohn Stadium for Summer music ? but what about the 100,000 Americans who annually spend their Summers in Europe ? They go for a varied and cultural vacation , and music certainly plays a large part in their plans . Also , it must be borne in mind that Europe 's music lovers would scarcely consider journeying to Fort Tryon Park for music that has heretofore been available to them simply by crossing a channel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motives and taking a universal view of the great art of music . it is surely to the interest of all true music lovers in the world to continue to give Vichy their hearty support . JAY WINGATE . New York , Dec. 30 , 1938 . Park Proposal Disapproved To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Is Mr. Rittenberg serious in his titanic scheme for tearing to pieces Fort Tryon Park , which has , only recently been created at the expense of millions , or is he just having his little joke ? He describes his project as " utterly American . " I can not imagine anything less American than turning the beautiful old Billings estate  --  now enjoyed by thousands who are city-bound in the hot weather  --  into a super-Salzburg . People who go abroad to the European music festivals are not likely to remain in New York in the Summer to listen to music at home . If more of the taxpayers ' money is to be appropriated ? while it lasts  --  would it not be better spent on some more sensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the genus New Deal ? KATHARINE METCALF ROOF . New York , Dec. 30 , 1938 . Honors to Cape Henry , Va . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : A Mr. Carpenter is quoted in a Provincetown , Mass. , dispatch to THE TIMES as having said : " Plymouth is getting away with murder with her famous rock legend " and " The title of Birthplace of America rightly belongs to Provincetown . " With no thought of interfering in the family quarrel of the two Massachusetts towns , perhaps it is not out of place to suggest that their fight is over a prize which belongs to neither of them but to Cape Henry in Virginia . At Cape Henry on April 26 , 1607 , landed the first permanent English settlers in America , and there was opened the casket containing the sealed orders on which was based the government of the colony soon afterward established at Jamestown , Va . As aptly phrased by a former Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts : " Any schoolboy by a simple arithmetical calculation can discover the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia as against the claim of Massachusetts : " C.

The Railroad Problem To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In " Topics in Wall Street " Dec. 30 , under the heading " Railroad Reorganizations , " you comment upon a matter which is of vital interest to all of us . Should the wishes of John J. Cornwall be carried out , then certainly we would be deep into the mire of totalitarian practices . The two-thirds majority being in position to impose its will on the one-third minority would certainly be confiscating the property of the minority . Surely you can not wish for a situation where minorities should lose any more of their rights than have already been sacrificed . The railroad men are looking for " rabbits out of the hat , " instead of making suggestions which would really solve the problem which now faces the roads . Railroad management and its various organizations have been asleep st the switch while labor and politicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be solved , and it can be solved " without penalty to capital or labor . " The prosperity of the entire nation hangs heavily upon the situation in the railroad industry . Yet , to solve the problem as suggested by Mr. Cornwall , by confiscating private property , would not be solving it at all . It would be a direct step toward totalitarianism and the abandonment of the Bill of Rights . OWE.N TAYLOR . New York , Dec. 31 , 1938 . Dispute in Teachers Union Dr. Langford Fails to See How Remarks Influenced Dr. Childs 's Action To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In an article in THE TLMES of Dec. 30 I am mentioned as having something to do with the decision of Professor John L. Childs of Teachers College to withdraw from the Teachers Union . I do not see how my conversations with Professor Childs to which the article refers could have caused him to leave the union . To the best of my knowledge they took place months after he discontinued his membership , which was in January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 537 of the Teachers Union is controlled by its membership , through majority vote at membership meetings or through referenda . When , however , regardless of what I had to say in support of this belief , Professor Childs insisted that Local 537 was controlled by Communists , I suggested that in justice to the Communists he might well hear what their leaders and authoritative spokesmen had to  --  say . I had the feeling then , and still believe , that no scholar should go by hearsay on any question , and should be ready to examine the facts as carefully as they can be viewed on first-hand study . Quite apart from our conversations . it is clear that Professor Childs does not agree with the policies of the Teachers Union . Instead of crying " Red ! " he might have done a service to the union by indicating where it has erred . HOWARD D. LANGFORD . Teachers College , Dec. 30 , 1938 . Recalling a Village Institution To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I have read with great interest the plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Greenwich Village , as an adjunct to the World 's Fair . All credit to the idea and Miss White . But if Grover Whalen really wishes to recall the Village days , when artists , poets and other literati bummed in its delightful atmosphere and made it famous , he must not overlook reconstructing the famous Garret  --  that one-and-ahalf story domicile of the last of the hangmen of Potter 's Field , which faced the Square , south of the Arch  --  an old , beamed , ship chandler 's structure , with its . fireplaces and fixings , its jumbled , warped , wooden furnishings and recklessly decorated walls . Most important of all , he will have to get Grace Godwin back to preside at the Garret , lounging in smock and sandals amid the customers , the haze , the hum and twang and crooning harmonies of guitar and fiddles , of those real Garret days . When the candlelights in the Garret went out in the early dawn and Grace Godwin flitted through the mists of the Square , Greenwich Village went to bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . New York , Dec. 31 , 1938 . Mr. Farley 's Stamp Grammar To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : With all the careful scrutiny which has been directed to postage stamps , I wonder that no one has noticed such a glaring error in grammar as the plural denomination of the one-and-onehalf-cent stamp . I missed it myself until recently when the Martha Washington profile appeared in the delicate shade of brown and I noticed the plural " cents . " I wrote to the Postmaster General , pointing out that the plural form begins with two , and that one with a fraction is not yet in the plural class ; also that $1.50 is read as one dollar and a half , and $.01% should likewise be read as one cent and a half , or one and a half cent . The Assistant Postmaster General replied : " From a technical viewpoint you are probably correct in your contention . * * * The matter will , however , be looked into further before another series of 1%-cent stamps is designed . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps for several years to come . But would it not be far more reasonable to relegate this stamp to the discard , where so many others have landed for much less patent reasons ? F. R. AL New York , Dec. 31 , 1938 . WPA Policing Plan " Naive " To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Senator Barkley 's naive suggestion that the WPA set up boards in each county to see that WPA does not politically misuse the funds entrusted it must be based on the idea " set a thief to catch a thief . " And this proposal comes from Kentucky , where the political use of WPA seems to have been at its worst ! JOHN W. RosiNsow . New York , Dec. 30 , 1938.
