In the icy darkness just before one dawn last week an automobile sped into that part of New York City which lies north of the Harlem River , ground to a halt at the great Bronx Terminal Market . Foodhandlers , working under arc lights , stopped to stare and pound their frozen hands together , as out of the car emerged a small , swart Napoleonic figure wrapped in a greatcoat . The man mounted , with assistance , the tailboard of a truck , took a paper from his pocket . Two shivering policemen braced their shoulders , put bugles to their chapped lips , sounded assembly . Half way through the call one bugle gave a despairing wail , froze tight . Provision men came running from all sides to see the show . The man in the greatcoat began to read in an enormous voice from the paper in his hands : <P> " Whereas a serious and threatening emergency exists in the traffic , transportation , sale and resale of ... a staple commodity of food , universally sold in all public markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whereas . . . wholesale marketing . . . has been restrained . . . . Whereas . . . wholesale dealers , jobbers and retailers are threatened and intimidated . . . . <P> " Now , therefore , I , Fiorello H. LaGuardia , Mayor of the City of New York , by virtue of the statutes and established customs in such case made and provided , do proclaim that an emergency exists which threatens the peace and good order of the City of New York , and do hereby prohibit from and after the 26th day of December , 1935 , the sale , display and possession of artichokes . . . . " <P> There was a round of applause . Police cars dashed forth carrying copies of the proclamation to every public market in the city . Well pleased with his early morning 's work , Mayor LaGuardia went off to have some hot breakfast . <P> The artichoke racket is supposed to have collected $1,000,000 annual tribute for the last ten years from New York City artichoke-eaters.         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
