From a crude shelter in the middle of a cornfield near Delphos , Ohio , one evening last fortnight a 36-year-old amateur astronomer scrutinized the northern sky through his 6-in. telescope . Ten degrees from the North Star he spotted an unfamiliar object , below naked-eye visibility . At that location his charts showed no star , no nebula . Amateur Astronomer Leslie C. Peltier watched the tiny blob of light for five hours . In that time it moved sufficiently far to betray itself as a comet . To Harvard Observatory , whose officials knew his name very well , Peltier sent a telegram . One of Harvard 's big telescopes swung up to confirm the find . Back to Delphos went another telegram : " Congratulations ! " The Peltier comet was the first discovered in 1936 . <P> Last week , after calculations of its orbit , Harvard announced that the comet was approaching Earth , had already increased in brightness from the ninth magnitude to the eighth . Now 120,000,000 miles distant , it will come within 20,000,000 miles ( less than one-quarter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its nearest approach late in July , it will have reached the sixth magnitude , will be the first naked-eye comet since 1927 . <P> A onetime farmer and garage mechanic , Leslie C. Peltier is now a commercial draftsman by day . Eighteen years ago , after reading a book called The Friendly Stars , he made his first telescope , a puny two-incher . Both Princeton and Harvard have now lent him larger instruments . He has observed some 47,000 heavenly bodies , is the sole discoverer of two previous comets , co-discoverer of three others . In 1933 Nova Ophiuchi , a variable star which had not flared up since 1898 , flared up again . Peltier was the first to see the outburst . Harvard passed on word of it to observatories the world over . Year later Peltier went to Cambridge as honor delegate at the convention of the American Association of Variable Star Observers , whose membership of 350 includes only twelve professionals . There , for his " tremendous contributions " to astronomy , he was given the association 's first merit award-a handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peltier why he did not join the staff of a big observatory . He replied that 1 ) he was satisfied to remain a freelance ; 2 ) he had not been invited . The fact is that amateurs render valuable service by " sweeping the sky , " a game for which professionals have no time . The professional usually has his research program mapped out for months ahead of time . He is thus not likely to come across any unexpected phenomenon . It was a British amateur named J. P. M. Prentice who discovered Nova Herculis , the spectacular " new star " of 1934 ( TIME , Dec. 31 , 1934 ) . A British music-hall comedian named Will Hay was among the first to see the great white spot which erupted on the belly of Saturn three years ago ( TIME , Aug. 21 , 1933 ) . The orbit of Pluto was theoretically predicted by professionals , but that outermost planet was actually discovered by an amateur named Clyde W. Tombaugh while working at Lowell Observatory in Arizona . <P> It is estimated that U. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some 50 clubs . The Pittsburgh club , formed as a branch of the Academy of Arts and Sciences , has a typical membership : engineers , doctors , dentists , lawyers , a bishop , two nuns .
