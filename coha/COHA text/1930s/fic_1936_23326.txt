MR . CHARRABANDI 'S ASSISTANT A STORY BY DOROTHY BLACK M R. CHARRABANDI unfastened the door of his house and stood looking this way and that way into the morning . There was nothing to be seen but the desert , pinky-yellow , splotched here and there with little patches of scrub . Mr. Charrabandi 's house was lightly built of corrugated iron sheets and was tacked onto the office , along the roof of which were painted the words : ANGLO-MALACCA OIL COMPANY FILLING STATION . LONDON . NEW YORK . Mr. Charrabandi called into the stillness of the morning : " Ramaya . . . . Rarnaya . . . . " There was no answer . Three vultures seated on a sandy ridge close by turned their heads to look at him , but they did not move . Now then , that fellow , where is he ? " said Mr. Charrabandi to nobody . He put on his battered solar toppee , unlocked the office door , and went in . Mr. Charrabandi always felt immensely important when he did this . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ancestors had probably been an efficient business man , passing east through the Canal . Mr. Charrabandi 's ancestors were a mixed lot . No nationality had been quite left out . In her heyday , they said his mother had been a beauty , but that was before Mr. Charrabandi 's time . She was already incredibly stout when he came along , living in a little house with gay shutters in Port Tewfic at the bottom of the Suez Canal . She told him his father was an Indian Prince . Conflicting rumor had it he was a bathroom steward on a P and 0 . Mr. Charrabandi did not care . He did not care about anything very much , though he was annoyed this morning to see he had forgotten once again to lock his safe . Ramaya had profited by it . The cash box had been battered open with a stone and lay on the floor , empty . Mr. Charrabandi was well aware where Ramaya had gone , even before he saw his splayed footprints marching off into the desert , keeping carefully away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed him . " Trouble , trouble , nothing but trouble , " said Mr. Charrabandi . He wrote a report for the Head Office saying he had been raided by Arabs . Then he went out and took a look round the landing ground . It was a still morning . The sleeve hardly moved at the top of the flagstaff . That flagstaff always gave Mr. Charrabandi a thrill . He would n't wonder if one of his ancestors had n't been a soldier . Labor was the main difficulty at the Anglo-Malacca Oil Company 's desert filling station . People did not take kindly to the place . Ramaya had done nothing but complain , in a high nasal whine . His belly was paining , or his grandmother dying , eternally . Mr. Charrabandi could not understand it . He liked the life himself . He had the job only because nobody else would take it . There was nothing to do there for days on end , which suited him admirably . He liked doing nothing . Sometimes for days on end no one came near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the office door , surveying the sky and wondering who would drop in next . The Dutch planes , east- and westbound , came regularly , but apart from them Mr. Charrabandi got little but casual passers-by . Be-goggled men finding their way about the world would come down and ask Mr. Charrabandi 's advice , casually as if he were a Piccadilly policeman . Mr. Charrabandi did not know the way anywhere except back to Port Tewfic , so he was not of much assistance to them , but he was always very pleasant . Sometimes a distant caravan passed on the skyline . Sometimes a stray Arab meandered by on a camel and stared in dumb wonder at the floating sleeve . Once there were a couple of strange women in a motor car . They came and they went . Mr. Charrabandi never inquired where they were going . He did not believe in useless inquiries . To be sure , one day when he went for a longer ride than usual , sitting very far on the back of his little ass , he found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he did wonder if it had anything to do with those two women . He was not in the least shocked . White people were so peculiar . There was never any saying what they would do next for pleasure . He had seen men who owned motor cars to ride in choosing to walk on foot through the broiling sun . He had seen them erecting colossal barriers for their horses to jump over , and falling off and breaking their heads . No doubt it was also their idea of pleasure to be turned into skeletons in the desert . It was none of his business , so Mr. Charrabandi did not worry , but he thought it must be certain he had no white men among his many ancestors . He neverfelt at all like doing any of these things . Ramaya was gone . There was nothing for it but to look for a new assistant . He sat at his office desk and wrote in a clear round hand : WANTED . ASSISTANT FOR FILLING STATION . APPLY SHARP . Then he heard a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose in a cloud as a small plane came down . A girl with a mop of golden hair jumped out . Hair that was , thought Mr. Charrabandi , like sunshine upon water . He stared at her , taken aback by her beauty and her youth . " Salaam , Babu , " said the lady . " Petrol , please . I 'm on my way to Australia . " A young girl , a pretty girl , and all by herself . There were no modern contraptions in Mr. Charrabandi 's filling station . The petrol had to go in by hand , five gallons at a time . The drums were heavy , and since Ramaya had run away , he had to heave them up the ladder himself . As he worked he thought , watching the girl out of the corner of his eye . . . a young girl . .. a pretty girl , and quite alone . A thought or so raised its head in Mr. Charrabandi 's brain . He looked at her again . She had taken a revolver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making sure it was loaded . A coldness seized Mr. Charrabandi 's extremities . No , he thought . Maybe not , he thought . He bowed before her , excruciatingly polite . Like a fawning spaniel he looked , with his treacle-brown eyes . " Everything is ready , Missie-Sahib . " " Nothing in the way of a meal to be had , I suppose ? " said the girl . Mr. Charrabandi was aware that , while he was terrified of her , she never gave him a second thought . It galled him extremely . " Unfortunately no , Missie-Sahib . My assistant , he has run away only this morning . " The girl surveyed the desert stretching as far as the skyline to north , south , east , and west of them . Upon a ridge of sand not far off the three vultures sat , wearing a thoughtful air . " Crumbs , " said the girl . " Where has he run to ? " " Yes , now . Where ? " said Mr. Charrabandi . He added , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is no use to lock the stable door after the boot is on the other foot . " " As you say , " said the girl , " as you say . " He did not like the twinkle in her eye . Her propeller cut the air , sending a hot blast over Mr. Charrabandi . He became involved in the slip-stream and had trouble with his toppee and his voluminous white cotton nether garments . She went into the morning like a white bird that dwindled to a bat , and then to a mosquito , and was lost altogether in the heat haze that shimmered over the sand . Mr. Charrabandi had to cook his own meal and clean his own house . That made him angry . He looked in his logbook to see whether anyone else was due . There was nothing listed till the Dutch plane on Friday afternoon . At dawn the following morning Mr. Charrabandi cranked up his car , took an extra can of petrol and an extra tin of water , and set out into the desert . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about him was covered with little red poppies , come out in an hour and as soon to die . There had been no wind , so he had no difficulty in following the tracks his own tires had made on the last journey from the banks of the Canal . The sun came up , a ball of orange fire hung in indigo clouds that were the last of the night . He saw Mount Sinai , a cardboard mountain pasted onto an opalescent background . The lights from the distant oil refinery twinkled and snapped like a circus . A ship rode at anchor at the mouth of the Canal , her green and red lights a-twinkle , her portholes a row of diamonds . She looked like an emerald and ruby brooch pinned on the bosom of the waters . Mr. Charrabandi reached the ferry at noon . He left his car with an Arab who lived in a mud house that had a flat roof , on which the junk of years was piled , and woven together with the lush tendrils of a cucumber . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noises at Mr.Charrabandi and emitted a fouismell . The ferryboat took him to Port Tewlic in an hour and a half . All about the Customs sheds where he landed officers in white uniforms and scarlet tarbooshes lounged in the shade . Rumor said many of them were Mr. Charrabandi 's brothers . " Assistant is run away . Very trouble , " said Mr. Charrabandi . " Always running , running . " They made sympathetic noises and exchanged the news of the town with him . As he passed down the narrow dusty streets shutters were thrown open and folks leaned out , hailing him and asking him what he did . Mr. Charrabandi told them what he did , repeating his tale of woe . He was hot and he was tired and he was thirsty , and he had to go to the Post Office with his notice before he could seek the shelter of his mother 's house . At the Post Office they pinned his notice up , among several others , upon a board . The postmaster very kindly promised to have it translated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Port Tewfic you can not say who will come along next . Mr. Charrabandi mopped his brow and went to his mother 's house . It was cool and pleasant there , the bright wooden shutters all closed to keep out the midday glare . His mother , to be sure , called him by a name that was not his , but he did not mind . When you have as many children as she had it becomes impossible , with increasing age , to remember who they all are . She was incredibly stout and bundled up in black garments after the manner of the Turkish women . When she went abroad she wore a yashmak that covered her mouth and nose , leaving free only her large soft eyes . There is much to be said for the fashion . " Sleep , my son , " she said . " No doubt we shall think of someone for you . " He was glad to obey her . He awoke at three o'clock to find her standing beside him . She had with her a long haunted-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was so thin he looked like a collection of twigs artlessly put together and bound in place with a loin cloth . " It is Liliya , a Corringhi , " said Mr. Charrabandi 's mother . " He will do . " Liliya put his two hands together as if in prayer , placed them to his forehead , and bowed very low . Mr. Charrabandi liked being bowed to . " He has run away from his own country , smuggling himself in the coal . He has unloaded himself here two weeks ago , needing food . He is perhaps a little foolish , but it does n't matter . " Mr. Charrabandi said " No , no . It does not matter . " To the lad , he said , pompously : " You will work for me at my filling station . " The lad bowed again with folded hands . " Sahib , " he said , " I am a poor man . The Sahib is my father and mother . " " It is good enough , " said Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find nothing better for the job . It is lonely and too far . " Mr. Charrabandi hurried down to the Post Office to tell them he was suited . They were surprised . Mr. Charrabandi 's situation was well known in the district . There had been no other applications . Mr. Charrabandi found Liliya squatting in the dust outside his mother 's door , idly writing nothing in the sand with one thin finger . He had collected his luggage , a bundle in a handkerchief , about the size of a large potato . " I take him , " said Mr. Charrabandi , within . " He is certainly stupid . But stupid people do not die . They do not have the belly always paining . They do not grow sick for lack of women , like the one before the one before last . They donot run away . As for being stupid , it does not matter . I myself shall teach him everything . " " My clever son , " said his mother . She was proud of him , whichever one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day , as they drove back together over the desert in the gathering daylight . " I am taking you to the Malacca Oil Company 's filling station . Do you know what that is ? " Liliya did not know . " It is where airplanes come down to get some more petrol . " That did not help . Liliya had never seen an airplane . They did not come to his country . He had not even heard of them . Mr. Charrabandi tried again . " In these days masters go up into the air like birds . Ladies also . And MissieSahibs . All up into the air , like birds , and out of sight . " Liliya made dumb noises of amazement and stared at him anxiously , as if expecting him to soar at any moment . " If the Sahib says so , it must be so , " he said . " And the Sahib himself  --  when does he go up ? " " 1 do not do it , " said Mr. Charrabandi pompously . " I assist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With petrol . " Liliya pointed with a sticklike finger to his own lean and hairy chest . " And I , shall I also go up ? " " No , " said Mr. Charrabandi shortly . " You are my assistant . You will help me to sell them petrol for money . Petrol is what makes them fly . " Mr. Charrabandi was enjoying himself . He had not felt so clever for years . He took Liliya over the office and the storehouse , and showed him the little lean-to shack where he was to live . After the coal bunkers of the SS Warlingham , it looked like heaven . Liliya settled down at once . Apart from the fact that he ate a lot , making shocking inroads into Mr. Charrabandi 's stock of provisions  --  and that from the moment of his advent the hens ceased entirely from laying  --  he was a good servant . For the first fortnight Mr. Charrabandi had no fault to find with him save his everlasting hacking cough . Then the Dutch plane arrived , three days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Liliya everything there was to tell , about planes and what to expect from them . It made no difference . " The Devil . . . the Devil . . . " yelled Liliya . He departed into the desert running , his feet sending little clouds of sand up behind him . Upon the ridge the vultures huddled together , like stockbrokers discussing the market fluctuations . Mr. Charrabandi had to attend to the Dutch plane himself . He was furious . He heartily disliked dragging the heavy drums over the sand . " Assistant is run away , sir , " said Mr. Charrabandi , explaining the situation to the Dutch pilot , who stood stretching his legs , looking about him . He was a great blond man with a tanned face and very blue eyes . He looked at the sky , the sand , and the vultures , and smiled . " It is no yonder , " he said , " that they run avay . " He smiled , showing beautiful white teeth . Then he too was gone again , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning , and presently that humming died . Round the edge of the shack crept Liliya , He still trembled , and his face was liver-colored . " Sahib , it was not the Devil , but a God . I have seen him . I myself , Liliya , have seen him with these eyes . In my country they would not believe such a thing , but now I know it to be true . " " Run away again when there is work to be done , and you 'll know something else to be true also . Many parts of body will be paining , " said Mr. Charrabandi . " Now then . " " Na , Sahib . I shall not run , but remain here to help you , with these Godsand their machines . When will he return , Sahib , this great one from the Heavens ? " Mr. Charrabandi said in his best European manner : " Co to Hell ! " Liliya became a very useful assistant from that time on . He did not run away when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed little bunches of red poppies , when there were any poppies , upon their wings . When he had nothing to do he squatted in the sun , writing in the sand with one finger . " So you have now an assistant , " said the big Dutchman , on his return journey east . " Ah , ha . That is good . " " Yes . But how long will it last I do n't know , " said Mr. Charrabandi . " Here is always trouble , trouble . . . " " I see that dame made it , " said the Dutchman . " A very fine thing . A very grand girl . " Mr. Charrabandi had no idea what he was talking about , but he smiled ingratiatingly and did not give himself away . Since he never saw a newspaper he had no idea what went on in the world beyond the pinky-yellow sand dunes among which he lived . In any case , what did it matter ? It was early in the New Year that a small plane landed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the green-and-yellow sleeve floated wide in the cold-weather breeze . The girl with the hair like sunshine on water jumped out . She was neat and pretty as if she had just come out of a bandbox . Babu , " she said , gaily . " I got there . And now I 'm getting back . Some petrol please . . . . I suppose there is nothing to be had in the way of a snack ? " Mr. Charrabandi did not feel she would fancy his curried goat . Besides , there was only just enough for himself and Liliya . " I am sorry , " he smiled ingratiatingly . " Here is everything very difficult . " He called to Liliya . Liliya had been occupied in the kitchen , grinding spices . He was still decorated with them , and over one shoulder he had flung a not clean kitchen cloth . " Crumbs ! " said the girl , her hands in her overall pockets . " What 's this you 've got here ? " " It is my assistant , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overalls . " A very stupid fellow . No brains at all anyhows . " The girl looked east and west . She looked north and south at the never-ending desert , pinky-yellow , merging with the skyline . " Well , I guess he would n't be here if he had many , " she said , half to herself . She smiled at Liliya , who stood transfixed , staring at her . Mr. Charrabandi gave him a push . " Now then , please , get on with the workings . " " Here , " said the girl . " Do n't you be rough with the poor lad . " She took a cigarette case out of her pocket , and lighted a cigarette . She stood beside the flagpost , a slight , gallant , boyish figure , the cold-weather breeze ruffling her bright hair . She felt in her pocket for money to give the poor downtrodden creature who was toiling over the sand with drum after drum of petrol , and unscrewing them in a frenzy of industry with a spanner . Poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She noticed it and was touched . His sticklike legs twinkled by her , and back again , dragging the heavy drums . He worked automatically , not thinking what he was doing . From their sandy ridge the vultures watched him . " Now then , you Young of the Owl , what are you doing ? " screamed Mr. Charrabandi , getting angry . Liliya had gone on working in a trance , his eye on the girl , his thinking apparatus entirely arrested . He had collected beside the plane on the sand twice as many drums as he needed . He was automatically dragging more and more of them out . He came to himself with a start and stood among the little crowd of drums , grinning sheepishly , scratching his head . Mr. Charrabandi addressed him in Corringhi for some moments , which set him off unscrewing drums with great rapidity , and nipping up and down the filling ladder . The girl watched him pitifully . " What a life ! " she thought . She recognized the gleam of worship in Liliya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Australia and other parts of the world . She wished she could do something for the poor bloke ; but what could one do ? She threw away her cigarette and gave him a handful of the assorted money that accumulates in the traveler 's pocket by the end of a large voyage . She climbed into her plane and , half in pity , half mischief , threw him a kiss . Then she rose into the sky again . The hum of her engine died away . She was gone . Liliya stood among the superfluous drums of petrol he had accumulated about him , staring at the assorted money in his hand , in a dream . " She has gone , " he said . " And I shall never see her like again . I did not know there were such folk living , Sahib . in my country if I were to tell them of it they would not believe me . " " Screw down those drums and get them back into store , " said Mr. Charrabandi impatiently . " Why you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office as well as the safe and stood for a moment , convinced that for once he had remembered everything there was to remember . He mounted his little ass and rode off into the desert , sitting far back on its stern . He knew there would be a caravan passing sometime that day , and he was out of tobacco . Liliya was still standing among the petrol drums in a species of trance . The Missie-Sahib had struck him dumb . Mr. Charrabandi smiled , remembering some of his own sentiments when he first saw her . They were wonderful , these white women , and the things they did ; but it was all wrong . Women should remain , a shapeless bundle of black garments , at home , donning the yashmak when they went abroad , not displaying their bright hair to be a confusion to mankind . Times were changing , and Mr. Charrabandi did not like change . He liked everything to go on as before , with nothing new to think about or remember . Liliya went on standing among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking , and he knew he would never be the same again . Into his poor simple mind all sorts of longings and dreams stirred . He looked afar , where the sand of the desert merged with the sky , and he thought as men have thought before him : " Oh for the wings of a dove . " Lying a little way off , he saw her cigarette . With trembling fingers he picked it up . He puffed it gingerly . It was still alight . A little plume of smoke blew off through the sunshine ; he tasted the delicate fragrance of Western tobacco for the first time in his life . Rapture stole through his thin hones . Cigarette in mouth , he went back to the petrol drums . He picked up one without a stopper , and began to look round for the spanner to shut it up again . As-he did so his always present cough seized him . The cigarette fell on top of the drum where the spirit had slopped over . There was a colossal resounding report that went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance , like the hum of an airplane , throbbing into silence . The Anglo-Malacca Oil Company 's filling station disappeared for a while in a cloud of pinky-yellow sand . The threevultures rose in the air , higher , and higher . Then they hung there , circling slowly . Mr. Charrabandi heard the report three miles away . He came hastening back as fast as his little ass could carry him . The sand was subsiding by the time he arrived . The office roof had gone . The shutters off his house lay scattered about the desert at intervals . There was a hole like a shell hole where Liliya had been standing . Petrol drums , twisted and split , were scattered over the landing ground . Wrapped about the flagstaff that carried the sleeve , was a rag of a dirty kitchen cloth . Mr. Charrahandi walked among the wreckage , stroking his chin . " Trouble , trouble , nothing but trouble , " he said sadly . He remembered now that he had forgotten to warn Liliya that petrol was very explosive and inflammable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . He scratched his head , trying to think of something plausible to tell the London Office . He propped the doors back into place , and swept the sand off his desk and chairs , rescuing his ledgers and some pens . Painstakingly he wrote in a large clear hand : WANTED . ASSISTANT FOR FILLING STATION . APPLY SHARP . He went out and cranked up his car , sighing wearily . Trouble , trouble . Nothing but trouble anywhere , all the time .
