txt A considerable increase in the amount of wheat which may be sold to the Nationalist Government in China for flood relief purposes , is reliably understood to be under considera- , tion by the Federal Farm Board . The Nationalist Government , In its inquiry to the board , asked for credit terms on 15,000,000 bushels of grain . It is now understood that the board has under advisement a proposal to sell twice that amount , 30,000,000 bushels , to the Nanking Government on a long-term credit basis . Under this new arrangement , it is stated , the board would specify that a large part of the grain , perhaps as much as 50 per cent , would be sold in the form of flour . Northwestern millers , it is declared , have urged the board to include such a provision in the sale agreement . An early announcement of the Chinese transaction was indicated by Mr. James C. Stone , chairman or the board , today . The protest of American ship owners against the failure of the board to require the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wheat it traded to Brazil for coffee , was answered by Mr. Stone with the explanation that this was a matter to which the board had given no consideration . The board assumed , Mr. Stone declared , that Brazil would use Brazilian ships to carry the 1,050,000 bags of coffee , and would use the same ships to transport the wheat to Brazil . He emphatically denied that there was any discrimination against American ship owners .
