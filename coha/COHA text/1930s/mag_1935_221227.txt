Five notable results of President Roosevelt 's silver purchasing policy have been : 1 ) a panic in China , 2 ) temporary dislocation of the Mexican banking system , 3 ) enrichment of a number of speculators at home &; abroad , 4 ) accumulation of an enormous hoard of bullion which the Treasury may never be able to sell and 5 ) booming bar trade in all the mining camp saloons of the Mountain States . <P> Last week the saloons in Virginia City , Nev. rocked with reports that " Eastern interests " were ready to put new money into old mines of the Comstock Lode , from whose steaming depths some $700,000,000 worth of metal has been blasted since its discovery in 1859 . In the purple days of the bonanza kings Virginia City was an easy-money centre of 30,000 people . Today it is a ghost town of 488 . <P> This week in Virginia City merger of four of the most fabulous Comstock mines will be broached-Ophir , Mexican , Andes and Consolidated Virginia . Only " Eastern interest " to admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identified in the local Press as a " New York contractor . " With his wife , the onetime Democratic National chairman was at nearby Lake Tahoe . <P> Though the money for modernizing the Comstock mines was reported to be in the hands of a " Raskob-Baruch-Pittman " group , both Nevada 's Senator Pittman and Bernard Baruch denied any financial interest . However , the Silver Senator admitted that he was advising Mr. Raskob as counsel . <P> In the early days of Depression a gold boom hit the mining States . It was followed by a silver boom which hit its proper pace this spring after Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau squeezed silver prices to a high of 81 per oz . ( Depression low : 25 ) . Secretary Morgenthau has currently let the price slip to 68 but by law he must continue buying until either his silver stocks amount to 25% of his gold stocks or the price goes to $1.29 per oz. , the more likely alternative .                 @ @ @ @
