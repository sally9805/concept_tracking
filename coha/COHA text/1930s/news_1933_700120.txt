txt Errors in English . To the Editor of The New York Bites : I note a letter from Henry W. Taft listing a number of objectionable habits becoming customary in journalistic English . His intent is quite praiseworthy , but I can not accept his ruling against the use of the one word " angle " instead of the phrase " may be looked at from another angle : " This brevity in speech is in harmony with other legitimate evolutionary developments in the language , as is the use of the word " cohtacted . " However , I would caution Mr. Taft to use the phrase " May be viewed " instead of " may be looked at , " and also against the phrase he uses further down in his letter --  " It also grates upon my nerves . " This last is very bad form . I would suggest that he use the word " annoy " or the word " irritate " in their various tenses to convey his idea . J. J. LAMAR . New York , Sept. 30 , 1933. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
