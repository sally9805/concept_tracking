In Indianapolis last week one Edwin Alson , a deputy Federal game warden , was hot under the collar . He made many a U. S. sportsman feel the same way by describing how advantage was taken of wild ducks on the Ohio River . <P> Said Warden Alson : " A barrel of corn mash , charged with alcohol , is left overnight near a sand bar or a sluice where wild ducks are known to feed . Early the next morning the hunters return . There are the ducks , either sleeping off a hangover or staggering around making silly quacking sounds . The alcohol leaves the ducks incapable of flying or swimming , and they are caught easily by hand . Some die of acute alcoholism . "
