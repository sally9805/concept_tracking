S. , which Sculptor Borglum would then carve beside the colossal figures of Washington , Jefferson , Lincoln , Roosevelt which he is hewing upon the austere face of Mount Rushmore , S. Dak . Discovering that the first hundred years were literally the hardest . Historian Coolidge took his time over the inscription , finally submitted a few paragraphs . <P> Sculptor Borglum is an artist before he is a respecter of ex-Presidents .

Historian Coolidge refused to accept the revised version , withdrew from the Memorial Association , refused last week to comment .
