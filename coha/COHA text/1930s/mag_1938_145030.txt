With the Wabash running a close second , the most musically celebrated of U. S. rivers is probably the misnamed Swanee. * But during the past year suburban Connecticut 's sluggish Saugatuck has meandered into the national consciousness . Last March the arty town of Westport , on its banks , got into an argument with itself about whether or not to become " the U. S. Salzburg " ( TIME , March 28 ) . <P> And last year Bridgeport Hydraulic Co. , which supplies water to a large part of southwestern Connecticut , proposed to dam the Saugatuck , throwing it completely out of kilter . Local patriots rose to the defense of their river , with " Save the Saugatuck " their watchword . To defend groves threatened by the utility 's axmen , women residents of the valley threatened to lash themselves to the trees . While Writers Stuart Chase and Deems Taylor protested , Fiddler Jascha Heifetz gave a " Save the Saugatuck " concert , devoted its proceeds to the cause . <P> Among the most fervent saviors of the Saugatuck is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Meriden , Conn. , hard by the threatened river . Broadcast last week on Conductor Howard Barlow 's CBS " Everybody 's Music " program was Composer Gerschefski 's contribution to the great Connecticut cause : a " Save the Saugatuck " Symphony . Subtitles of the flashily orchestrated symphony 's four rather noisy movements : 1 ) Natural Ruggedness ; 2 ) Robot Controlled Precision without Escape ; 3 ) Natural Flow ; 4 ) Dynamite Accomplished Perversion and Artificiality of Every Description . <P> <P> *Stephen Foster , U. S. composer of the song Way Down upon the Swanee River ( properly called Old Folks at Home ) , had never seen Florida 's Suwannee River about which his song was written , got the misspelled name from an old map . Once the song was written it was impossible to correct the spelling , because the tune calls for a word of two syllables , and the real Suwannee has three .
