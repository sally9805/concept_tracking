STUDY IN BLACK AND WHITE A STORY BY LAURENCE KIRK O r vER BARING had n't been unhappy with his wife . He admitted that , He had no fault to find with Prue  --  in fact that was just the trouble . She looked after his house admirably , she was always kind and thoughtful , she was not unintelligent . With her dark , dark hair and gentle eyes she was even still attractive to him . The difficulty was that she was n't nearly so attractive as somebody else . The one thing that Oliver did n't admit was that he had fallen for a second-rate blonde . He was not the sort of man that either he or anyone else would expect to succumb to a silver dress and platinum hair . Prosperous , middle-aged , reserved , and serious , one of the five best-known architects of his day , a man to whom men listened with respect and from whom women concealed their boredom  --  was it likely that such a person would go and lose his head ? Not in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat ponderous exterior there dwelt the twisted emotions of a passionate puritan . In spite of his prosperity and his solid good looks , he had never really been tempted until Paula laid her finger on him . Women as a rule put him down as too good , too settled , to be of any personal interest ; but such a consideration was the last thing to deter Paula . She needed someoneworthy of her talents . A dark-skinned , platinum-haired widow , she was attractive , Paula . Oliver never paused to consider the sort of life her first husband must have had . If he had inquired he might have been struck by Mr. Farrow 's resemblance to himself , for Paula 's requirements were quite simple . A prosperous and somewhat stupid husband and then a young man or two . Anyway , to Oliver Paula was romance . She was the antidote to seven years of placid , contented married life . Had Oliver seen her behaving to some other man as she behaved to him , he might have described her very shortly and accurately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that type of very serious , not to say conceited , disposition which prevented him from calling the things that happened to him by the same names that he applied when they happened to other people . To him Paula was romance , glamour , excitement , danger  --  everything that his marriage had ceased to be . But she was n't his mistress . Oliver sometimes prosily reminded himself that he would never have consented to any clandestine affair : that he was n't that kind of man . In any case Paula had decided that it was to be marriage and nothing short of it , so it did not much matter what Oliver thought . Now on this twenty-first day of November matters had reached a climax . As Oliver closed the door of Paula 's flat at six-thirty in the evening , he was feeling lightheaded and intoxicated . He had just had two cocktails , but the intoxication did not come from that . It was Paula herself that had gone to his head , Paula reclining on the sofa , black cushions , a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair hair . Dazzling , that was the word for Paula . Now that he had left her he could n't believe that anything so stupefyingly beautiful could really exist . Nor could he believe . . . Good heavens , had he actually promised ? Had he finally committed himself ? Had he really arranged to run away with her on Wednesday week ? As Oliver walked on through the November dusk he became less lightheaded and more heavy of heart . But I ca n't have promised her that , he thought ! I never meant to . I 've just been toying with the idea . I ca n't really leave Prue and the two children . At least not on Wednesday week . It 's too soon . I have n't had time to think . We 're dining with the Wares the week after , and then there 's Marjorie 's birthday . She 'll be six on the third of December . How on earth can I run away with Paula ? Then he thought of Paula 's fair head on those black cushions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a violent wave of passion came over him . He translated this physical urge into his own rather prosy political language . I have promised , he thought solemnly , I have pledged my word , and I am a man who keeps his word . Resides , I have a right to my own life . It 's Prue 's fault , all wrapped up in the children , she does n't know how to keep a man 's love . And she 's amply provided for . She does n't really need me . Nor do the children . Girls ! They do n't really need a father . It would have been different if they 'd been boys . I could n't have left them in that case ; they 'd need a father 's guidance . I 'm not the sort of man really to neglect my duty . . . . Just for a moment the thought occurred to him , what a good thing it is that they are n't boys , but he hurriedly pushed it away from him . He could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him again . But I ca n't really be going to leave Prue and the children , he thought . After seven years ! My home broken up , my name dishonored , my business ruined ! What am I thinking of ? It 's sheer madness . . . . However , once more the dazzling vision of Paula 's head came up to check his cowardice . After all , it did n't do Steinway any harm , he went on , and I 'm a more eminent man than he is . And Paula is a lady , which is more than can be said for that Cranford woman . People are sensible nowadays , realize that a man 's private life is his own affair . And , by heaven , it is his own affair . I 'm not going on being torn to pieces like this . I 've a right to Paula , to my happiness . From that moment his mind was made up . Wednesday week . He had promised and he would keep his promise . All that remained to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sorry for her . She was a good woman within her limitations , and she had done her best to follow him in his prosperous career . Not her fault that she could n't quite keep up , not her fault that he was such a remarkable man . If only she had n't been so blind , always taken him for granted . It was going to be a terrible shock to het , such a terrible and unexpected shock that by the time Oliver had his fingers on the handle of her drawing-room , he had decided that the kindest way to inform her of his intentions would be to write her a letter after he had gone off with Paula . Whether this conclusion was really to spare her feelings or to circumnavigate his own arrant cowardice , that he did not pause to consider . Oliver turned the handle and walked in . " Well , my dear , " he began  --  and then he stopped . Prue was standing in front of the gilt Provencal mirror above the mantelpiece , and she was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or pretended she did not , notice his entrance . She was turning her head this way and that , patting her hair here and pushing it there , apparently very satisfied with the effect she was making . But it was not this unexpected exhibition of vanity that made Oliver pause and gasp for breath . Prue 's dark , dark hair was no longer dark . It was the purest platinum , exactly the same color as Paula 's . For five seconds Oliver thought it was Paula . Considering that his thoughts were centered on a certain exotic vision in his mind and that Prue also was wearing a black dress , it is not surprising that he thought this . However , after those five seconds he realized his mistake , and with a sinking sensation in the pit of his stomach began to wonder exactly why Prue had suddenly dyed her hair  --  and dyed it that particular color . " What on earth have you done to yourself ? " he asked , abruptly coming forward . Prue slowly turned round . " Hullo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Early , Oliver thought ! If she only knew ! . . . Or does she know ? Then he repeated his question . " What on earth have you done to yourself , Prue ? " She posed for him very demurely . " I 've had my hair dyed , Oliver . Like it ? " Oliver pretended not to be interested , but he examined her hair very closely . It was marvellously natural , beautifully done . You really could n't tell at ail . . . . And he wondered  --  was Paula 's natural or dyed like this ? " I do n't like dyed hair , " he said heavily . " Oh , Oliver ! " Prue laughed . At that moment Oliver knew that she knew . Obviously she had known all this time that he was carrying on with Paula , and now had chosen this strange method of telling him . But how much did she really know , he asked himself anxiously ? And what did she intend to do ? " Why did you Iaugh like that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's so like you , Oliver dear . You do hate any change , do n't you ? " Oliver gave her a look which was half a threat and half an appeal , and she went on . " I think it 's rather nice myself , and it 's very fashionable . All the best people are having it done . " Oliver stared at her . " You 'd no right to do this without telling me beforehand . " Prue smiled . " What would you have said , my dear ? " she asked . " I  --  I , why , I . . . But what made you do it ? It 's an extraordinary thing to do without telling me . You must have had a reason . " " Darling , you know I never have a reason I was only tired of myself after being the same all these years . I thought perhaps you were getting tired of me too . " Oliver gulped . " I liked you as you were . " " Did you , darling ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  um  --  I do n't think it suits your type . " " Oh , Oliver , you always say that , and you do n't really know what my type is . " No , by heaven I do n't , was what Oliver wanted to say . However , he merely mumbled : " I liked you as you were . " " Did you , my dear , really ? " Prue put up her face to be kissed , and Oliver , thinking of Judas , kissed it . " Did you really ? " Prue repeated . " Yes , " said Oliver quickly , " What time 's dinner ? " Dinner fortunately was in less than half an hour , and Oliver escaped to his bath . He could not have stood another moment of that conversation . After the many varied and violent emotions of the evening , he felt shattered and unpleasantly ridiculous . His brain was in a turmoil as he vigorously exercised his sponge . Prue knew . There was no doubt about that . What was worse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended to come out into the open and tax him with his association with Paula she would have done it by now . As it was , she would go on being her sweet self , seeing nothing , saying nothing  --  but flaunting that platinum hair like a warrant of arrest before his eyes . Mean , thought Oliver ! Cowardly1 He summed up his outraged feelings as he struggled with his tic : Confound it all , I never thought she had it in her . Sir Joseph and Lady Smedley were their guests that evening . It was a duty dinner of the duller sort , but never in his life had Oliver been more glad of company . Anything , anything was better than being left alone with Prue . Both the guests made flattering remarks to Prue about her changed appearance : Sir Joseph 's being more sincere than his wife 's , who was too conscious of her own more permanent transformation . Then at dinner , while Lady Smedley chattered aboutquick tricks and conventions  --  she seemed to remember every hand she had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prue 's accusing hair . I wo n't stand it , he was thinking . I shall have it out with her afterward . I 'm not going to put up with this sort of thing . That was his opinion while they were eating the sole rneuniere . Later on , when a wing of pheasant was on his plate , he had changed his mind . TaIkl What 's the good of talk , he thought ? It wo n't lead us anywhere , and she 's a better talker than I am . I must act and act quickly . I must go away with Paula at once . I ca n't go on living with Prue now that I 've made up my mind  --  and she knows . Finally when the table was being cleared for dessert he was still of the same opinion ; but he did notice how extraordinarily attractive Prue was looking . That platinum hair did suit her . It suited her just as much as it suited Paula . More perhaps , for she had kinder , more womanly eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he undercalled , he revoked ; and it was only eleven-fifteen when Lady Smedley , who had been his partner throughout , acidly remarked that it was very late and they could n't possibly play another rubber . When they had gone Oliver slumped down in a chair , looking tired and rather pathetic . Prue came over and put her hand lightly on the side of his head . " What 's the matter , my dear ? " she asked . " You do n't seem yourself at all . " " I 'm perfectly all right , " Oliver said . " Are you sure ? I think you 've been working too hard lately . Why do n't you throw everything over for a bit and go away and have a rest ? " " A restl " he echoed . " Well , a change . I think it 's what you need , " Oliver looked at her very searchingly , then wearily rose to his feet . " Perhaps I will , " he said shortly and went to his room . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's existence . Prue kept up the same pretense of seeing nothing , knowing nothing . Oliver saw Paula once and then avoided her . He could not bear being with either of them , for when he was with Prue he kept imagining he was with Paula , and when he was with Paula he kept imagining he was with Prue . He was being torn in pieces , all the more so because as each day passed lie became more and more aware how very attractive Prue was looking . The only anchor he had in this emotional turmoil was his pledged word . He kept saying to himself  --  I have promised Paula and I am a man who keeps his word . Nevertheless , when the fateful Wednesday arrived , and he wrote that letter saying that although he had always appreciated her love and understanding the only decent thing to do was to say good-by  --  it was to Paula and not to Prue that he sent it . Incidentally he had a reply couched in such trenchant terms that he felt that perhaps it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make love to his wife . He wanted to confess the whole miserable tale to her , but he could n't quite bring himself to do it . He was n't frank enough by nature to make such a complete surrender . Nor did he think it wise . The only way to preserve such little prestige as he had left as a husband was to leave some doubt in Prue 's mind . After all she could n't know for certain exactly how far things had gone , and it was better that she should never know . If he did tell her , she either would n't forgive him or else she would ; and Oliver could not estimate which prospect pleased him the less . It seemed to him that it was the reticerices in married life , the things that are n't said rather than the things that are , that make the holy state endurable . Anyway he began to make love to Prue , to bring her flowers and pay her little attentions . She held him off for a while , just as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally she took him back and they were very happy indeed . As Oliver somewhat heavily expressed it , the blonde in Prue had reawakened his love for the brunette . In other words , he was enjoying all the advantages of adultery with none of its anxieties . This blissful state naturally did not continue forever . Prue 's hair remained platinum for only six months . She said that it was because of the continual nuisance and expense of having it touched up that she had it altered again . But Oliver knew better . No doubt , like him , she had read in the paper of Paula 's marriage , and knew that she no longer had any cause for anxiety . Oliver could have told her , but did n't , that she no longer had any cause for anxiety whether Paula was married or not . That was all over . He loved Prue , and he loved her just as much when she became a brunette again . Oliver had never quite regained the prestige which he had lost in his own mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent of the shares in their marriage , he now considered himself lucky if he could feel that he owned half of them . He was still inclined to be stately and ponderous and at the beginning of a discussion to lay down the law . At the end of it , however , though he did n't ever admit that he was wrong , it was generally Prue 's wishes that were carried out . Only once again did he have any tendency to stray . That was seven years later  --  Oliver 's dangerous ages seemed to run in periods of seven years ? and this time it was a copper-haired beauty . She was a lovely creature and considerably less exacting than Paula . In fact , who knows what might have happened if Oliver had not been obsessed with the fear of walking into his house one evening and finding Prue standing in front of the mirror with flaming red hair . This fear began to assume such alarming proportions that it became a positive neurosis , with the result that one day Oliver hastily said good-by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointment . After that there was no more trouble . Oliver mellowed with age though he never acquired more than a rudimentary sense of humor . At the age of fifty-three he entered Parliament , which did nothing to diminish the heavy solemnity to which he had always been prone . About this time , however , he began to feel that sooner or later he would have to tell Prue the full story of the platinum episode . He knew that it would be a sacrifice , a final surrender , but he felt that it was demanded from him after Prue 's devotion all these years . It seemed to him a pity that when a complete understanding with her was so near , this should be allowed to stand in the way . However , he was not practiced in the art of telling stories against himself , and it was not till ten years later that the confession was finally made . Even then it would probably have been postponed , as it had been so often postponed before , but Oliver thought he was dying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Oliver was n't accustomed to being ill ; and like other men of his kind , he was really a pleasanter character when he was n't feeling too healthy . The pain and weakness brought him an unaccustomed humility , and he lay in bed thinking how kind and good Prue had always been . This was in November . He still thought he was dying although he was really convalescent , and it was one evening when Prue was sitting by his bed ( her hair by the way now had touches of silver gray ) that he looked back and remembered that other November evening when he had promised to run away with Paula . What a blessing that Prue had saved him from her , he thought ! All the same what agony it was ! How he had wanted her , how he had longed to cut loose ! At length he put his hand gently on Prue 's and murmured wanly : " We 've been very happy together , my dear . " " Dear Oliver ! " Prue replied . Oliver paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . . . . It 's all gone past so quickly . . . . We 're old people now , the children grown up ? married . It seems strange that it 's all happened so soon . But I 'm glad to see them so happy . They 're good girls , Prue , like you ! " In the silence that followed he felt a warm tear on his hand , and he looked up . " My dear , what 's the matter ? You must n't cry . " Prue sniffed and wiped her eyes . " It 's nothing , Oliver . . . . Only you 're so good , I . . . " She did n't intend to say any more , but Prue was impulsive . Why should n't I tell him , she thought ? We 're old people . We 've lived our lives . We ca n't harm each other any more . And I 've always wanted to tell him . I ca n't go on and on until I die without telling him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said suddenly . " My dear ! " " But it 's true . I have n't always been ? quite faithful to you . " Oliver sat up . " What 's that ? " " Oh , I 've been faithful in everything that matters , " she went on quickly . " Your career , our children , I put them before everything . .. . But I once had a lover . " Oliver lay back against the pillows and feebly blinked his eyes . " You had a lover ? " " Yes , Oliver . " " And you say you 've been faithful in everything that matters ? " " Yes , Oliver , I say that . " " Why did you have a lover ? " Prue made a pathetic little gesture . It was as if to say , why are we born , why do we die , how are we to account for all the things that happen in between ? At length site went on . " I ca n't tell you why , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and yet I did n't even love him . That sounds horrid , does n't it ? I do n't know  --  perhaps it was your fault a little , my dear . You neglected me rather about that time . " Oliver still lay back on the pillows . She had a lover , he thought , she had a lover  --  and I never had a mistress . " When was this ? " he demanded at length . He hardly dared to ask . " A very long time ago , " Prue returned quietly . " We must have beenmarried about six or seven years . You were very busy then , big contracts ; and he was very idle . He was an artist . Selfish . Worthless . But good-looking . " " Why did it ever stop ? " Oliver asked . " He got tired of me , " Prue told him simply . " He got tired before I did , and I suffered horribly . . . . Do you remember that time when I dyed my hair ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting tired of me then . I dyed my hair because I was ready to do anything to hold him . " " You dyed  --  your hair  --  for himl " " Yes , Oliver . And it did n't work . I could n't hold him . . .. Oliver , do n't moan like that . I ca n't bear it . . . I had to tell you . I 've always been worried about it . I lost him . But then you began to notice me again . I realized what a fool I had been , and we were happy again . . . . Oliver , Oliver , do n't moan like that . . . . We were happy . I never loved anyone but you . " Oliver stopped moaning , and for a full minute he lay hack against the pillows , with his eyes shut . Then at last to his undying credit , he kissed her hands and laughed .                   @ @
