Able statesmen , like glamor girls , are expert in staging acts to flatter and impress useful admirers . Last September Adolf Hitler staged one of his most effective when he entertained Mussolini in Berlin . Signor Mussolini who , isolated for nearly 15 years in Italy , had come to think of himself as the most potent man in Europe , was shocked into a warmer enthusiasm for his ally when he saw the magnificently trained , well-oiled military machine that Hitler turned out for his inspection . Last week Adolf Hitler , mindful of his other success , decided to play host again , for a similar useful purpose . <P> His guest this time was just about the toughest boss-man in Eastern Europe , His Serene Highness astute old Admiral Nicholas Horthy de Nagybanya , Regent of the kingless Kingdom of Hungary . If &; when Hitler decides to invade Czechoslovakia , Admiral Horthy as an awestruck friend can play the same part that Mussolini played when Hitler invaded Austria . If he does , the $750,000 Hitler expended last week on the Admiral 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a warship of one state should be christened by the wife of the head of another state . But last week , at Kiel , Mme Horthy was called upon to break a bottle of German champagne over the nose of the newest 10,000-ton German cruiser . " I christen thee the Prince Eugen ! " she cried . Emotional Hungarians were deeply moved , for historic Prince Eugen was no German . More than two centuries ago under the Habsburg banner of the Austro-Hungarian dynasty he delivered the Danube valley from the Turks . <P> This was flattery . What followed was intended to impress Hungary 's dictator . In a grand review 117 ships of the German Navy sailed past the Fhrer and the Regent . Admiral Horthy was then permitted to inspect the brand new , Nazi-rebuilt defenses of the island of Helgoland , in the North Sea , once dismantled under the Treaty of Versailles , now again a potent naval base . <P> Next day Hitler and Horthy rolled by special trains across Germany to Berlin , where they were welcomed on a gayly decorated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nazi Goebbels . The colossal German military display which followed was even bigger than that staged last year for Premier Mussolini . In the Berlin suburb of Charlottenburg 1,100 armored cars and tanks , 318 motorcycles , 300 heavy guns , 750 cavalrymen , 61,000 infantrymen passed before Regent Horthy in just over two hours ' time . <P> The foreign military attachs and the Regent suddenly spied in the hurrying military parade four specimens of a completely new heavy mobile gun . Each gun appeared to have a crew of about 40 and sped past in five sections , each rolling on rubber tires and pulled by a heavy tractor . First section , the gun carriage ; second , the gun cradle ; third , the immense recoil and recuperator gear ; fourth , incidental equipment of the gun ; and fifth , the gun barrel which appeared to be some 45 feet long with a calibre of ten inches . A retired naval officer of a Great Power exclaimed : " I have seen plenty of guns like that on shipboard , but I have never before seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
