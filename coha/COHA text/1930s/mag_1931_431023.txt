 |p823  The Real Sherlock Holmes Condensed from The Golden Book Magazine ( December , ' 30 ) Vincent Starrett Author of " Seaports in the Moon , " " Murder on B ' Deck , " etc. ; lecturer at the Medill School of Journalism THE greatest detective of the modern world is dead at last . Sherlock Holmes has gone upon his final quest , the most mysterious of all his strange adventures . There can be little doubt that the real Holmes was Sir Arthur Conan Doyle himself . In innumerable ways throughout a life of extraordinary service the novelist demonstrated the truth of the assertion . From first to last  --  as student , physician , writer , spiritualist , and prophet of the war he was always the private detective , the seeker after hidden truths , the hound of justice upon the trail of injustice and official apathy . To be sure , he has told us , time and again , that the model for the immortal detective was Dr. Joseph Bell of Edinburgh , his onetime instructor in medicine ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , was all that went into the making of Sherlock Holmes . In the circumstances , and after the tales had become known , it was inevitable that the author of the Holmes saga would be called upon to enact the role of his fictional character , and not infrequently he accepted the implied challenge . Twice in his career he undertook cases requiring heavy call upon his time and energies , because he believed that justice had not been done . The cases of George Edalji and Oscar Slater were notorious in their day ; and the thunder of Doyle 's denunciation - crossed the Atlantic . In the first of these cases Sir Arthur secured the release from prison of a young man who had been given a seven-year sentence for the crime of horse-maiming . By showing , in a series of articles based on his study of the records of the case , that the police , " all pulling together and twisting things to their end , " had convicted Edalji on incredibly weak evidence , Sir Arthur brought about the appointment of a government committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Slater case , the celebrity of which was greater , had for its victim a Miss Marion Gilchrist , an elderly spinster living in Glasgow . She was murdered in her flat on the 21st of December , 1908 . Her servant , Helen Lambie , was  |p824  out of the place at the time , purchasing a newspaper , and it was during her ten-minute absence that the murder was committed . Returning from her errand the servant found a young man named Adams at the Gilchrist door , ringing the bell . He was from the flat below . He and his sisters had heard a noise above and a heavy fall , and he had been sent upstairs to ascertain what had happened . The servant opened the door with her key . Then as they hesitated on the threshold , a man appeared from within , who approached them pleasantly , seemed about to speak , but instead passed them and rushed down the stairs . In the dining room the body of Miss Gilchrist was found , the head brutally beaten in and covered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gilchrist was the possessor of a valuable collection of jewelry , robbery would appear not to have been the motive for the murder , since all that was missing was a diamond brooch worth possibly so . A box of papers had been broken open and the contents scattered . The description of the man seen by Adams and Helen Lambie was not particularly good ; they were in some disagreement ; and it was not at all the description of Oscar Slater , a German Jew , who was ultimately arrested and condemned for the crime . The apprehension of Slater came about because he had pawned a diamond brooch just before starting for America . He was arrested in New York a returned to Glasgow , where was discovered beyond question of doubt that the brooch in question had been in his possession for years and never had belonged to Miss Gilchrist . The public had lost its head , however , and the police were in a similar state . Slater was poor and without friends . His morals were shown not to have been of the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man seen by Adams and Lamhie was amended to fit Slater . He proved a clear alibi , but as his witnesses were his mistress and his servant girl , it was not allowed . No attempt was ever made to show a connection between Slater and anybody in the house occupied by Miss Gilchrist . He was a stranger in Glasgow . At the trial he was not too well defended , and the Crown ultimately won the conviction under Scottish law by a vote of nine to six . Slater was condemned to death , the scaffold was erected , and two days before the day set for the execution the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment . He was serving his term when Arthur Conan Doyle became interested in his plight . In Sir Arthur 's brilliant pam-  |p825  hlet , the Case of Oscar Slater , there is all the fascination of a tale from Sherlock Holmes . Sir Arthur questions whether the murderer was after the jewels at all . " When he reached the bedroom , he did not at once seize the watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His attention was given to a ooden box . Were the papers his object , and the final abstraction of one diamond brooch a mere blind ? " He remarks on the fact that the murderer knew enough to go straight to a spare bedroom where the jewels and papers were kept , and points to a line of investigation : " What men had ever visited the house ? The number must have been very limited . What friends ? What tradesmen ? What plumbers ? " Surely that is all good Sherlock Holmes , as even more brilliantly is this : " How did the murderer get in if Lambie is correct in thinking that she shut the doors ? I can not get away from the conclusion that he had duplicate keys . In that case all becomes comprehensible , for the old lady whose faculties were quite normal would hear the lock go and would not be alarmed , thinking that Lambie had returned before her time . Thus , she would only know her danger when the murderer rushed into the room , and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fall , as she was found , beside the chair upon which she had been sitting . But if he had not the keys , consider the difficulties . If the old lady had opened the flat door her body would have been found in the passage . Therefore , the police were driven to the hypothesis that the old lady heard the ring , opened the lower stair door from above ( as can be done in all Scotch flats ) , opened the flat door , never looked over the lighted stair to see who was coming up , but returned to her chair and her magazine , leaving the door open and a free entrance to the murderer . This is possible , but is it not in the highest degree improbable ? Miss Gilchrist was nervous of robbery and would not neglect obvious precautions . " All in all the document rings with the inflections of Holmes himself . However , it was to no immediate purpose . The novelist 's newspaper campaign stirred England and even brought about another government commission to inquire into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slater was allowed to languish in prison . There , for years , the unhappy affair rested . From time to time , as Slater 's incarceration lengthened , efforts were made to reopen the case , and Sir Arthur 's own labors were unremitting , but it was 19 years after the convic ( Continued on page 827 )  |p827  ( Continued from page 825 ) tion before his efforts were successful . Then , at long last , Slater was released a short two years ago , in July of 1928 . According to newspaper reports , he accepted a government offer of $30,000 as compensation for his wrongs ; then , with strange ingratitude , refused to repay a sum of money $1500 guaranteed by Doyle before the retrial at which the prisoner was acquitted . Slater , smoking a large cigar at a Brighton hotel , after a couple of rounds of golf , merely shrugged when asked for the repayment . " I can not pay , " he said . " All my money is invested , and though I made $1o,000 from newspaper articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Minor cases were presented frequently for Sir Arthur 's solution , and it was often his pleasure to put his wits to work on them , usually with success . But sometimes he was unsuccessful . He relates with great gusto , in his autobiography , how , on the occasion of a burglary within a stone 's throw of his own home , the village constable with no theories at all had seized the culprit , while he ( Sir Arthur ) had got no farther than the Holmesian conclusion that the man was left-handed and had nails in his shoes . Even in his spiritualistic investigations , which occupied his later years , Sir Arthur was at all times the detective , applying the methods of his fictive character to psychic phenomena . To the end he was a remarkable example of the scientific investigator touched with the curiosity and credulity of a child an admirable blend , it would seem , for the perfect sleuth. @#
