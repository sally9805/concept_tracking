THOUGH the average American is unaware of its existence , the press of the Roman Catholic church is today one of the most influential publishing units in the United States . More powerful than any other religious press , it includes , according to Charles H. Ridder , president of the Catholic Press Association , 139 newspapers , with a circulation of 2,639,165 , and 197 magazines , with a circulation of 4,604,141 , besides more than 4,000 local publications . What gives this press its peculiar importance in comparison with the press of other religious groups is the fact that the Catholic church engages in politics on a vast scale and that Catholicism is in fact the oldest of the international isms . The American Catholic press is a vital part of the church 's political machinery and was greatly encouraged by Pope Pius XI , who saw it as a powerful agency of Catholic Action  --  that is , cooperation between laity and hierarchy for the attainment of Catholic aims . Technically , the Catholic press ' does not speak for the church . Only The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question either the news or the news interpretations in the Catholic press . This is especially true of readers of the sixty-odd diocesan and arch-diocesan organs . These are usually weekly newspapers and have the largest lay circulations  --  frequently exceeding 50,000 . Each receives its official status from the bishop , and three out of four are edited by priests . Sometimes the paper is held in the bishop 's name , along with other church property ; sometimes it belongs to a corn : pany controlled by wealthy laymen . In either case its influence in the diocese comes from the bishop 's recommendation . The paper is what he wants his flock to read . Bishop Molloy of Brooklyn , who last November was decorated by the Fascist government of Italy , must , one surmises , approve of his diocesan paper , the Tablet , which is anti-New Deal , anti-C . I. 0. , anti-Semitic , pro-Fascist , pro-Coughlin , and pro-Franco . On the other hand , Cardinal Mundelein , late Cardinal Archbishop of Chicago , urged his people to read the New World , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-Coughlin , anti-Fascist , distrustful of Franco . Both are official Catholic publications . It was through the Freeman ' : r Journal , his official organ , that Bishop Hughes began in 1852 his campaign to secure public money for Catholic schools . The continuity of Catholic policy is seen in the keynote address to the 1939 meeting of the Catholic Press Assodation , in which Bishop Gannon counseled the Catholic editorsto work for the same goal , as yet , unattained . ( This campaign , today the most important domestic drive on the church 's program , is assuming increasing importance in the Catholic press . Witness the second encyclical of Pius XII . ) Catholic campaigns against birth control , " indecent " literature , the Child ' Labor Amendment , and the liberal government of Mexico , and in behalf of motion-picture censorship and Spanish fascism , were largely directed by these " official " organs . Father Peter M. H. Wynhoven , editor of Catholic Action of the South , and vice-president of the Catholic Press Association , lists 235 important Catholic periodicals which though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper church authorities . Included are publications of religious orders , such as the Jesuit America , the most influential Catholic publication in the United States , and of Catholic societies and fraternal orders , such as the Holy Name Journal , sponsored by the Holy Name Society . Catholic Action , official organ of the National Catholic Welfare Conference , speaking for the American hierarchy , is " approved , " not " official . " The most widely circulated Catholic journal of our times , Father Coughlin 's Social Justice , was formerly " approved " but early this year lost that standing . Father Wynhoven does not list it as a Catholic publication . He lists the liberal Commonweal as " approved , " but Commonweal editors do not know who " approved " it . The Catholic Worker is neither " approved " nor " official . " In 1920 the National Catholic Welfare Conference , the American hierarchical organization , established a press service which now furnishes to Catholic papers a weekly news service averaging 50,000 words , including foreign cable and radio dispatches . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably the most influential Catholic press bureau in the world . The Catholic Press Association , founded in 1890 , which today includes 142 leading Catholic publications , is also important in formulating Catholic press policies . A significant effort to streamline the Catholic press is the work of Monsignor Matthew Smith , editor of the Denver Register , who has persuaded twenty-two dioceses to add , local items and issue their own edition of the Register . FROM-COUGHLIN TO MUNDELEIN A Catholic of any political point of - view can today find at least one Catholic paper to suit his taste  --  whether he is progressive or fascist . The foetal-fascist wing of the Catholic press was outlined by Social Justice on July 17 last in a list which gave as " required reading " America , the Tablet , and Social Justice . Light , organ of the International Catholic Truth Society and edited by the Coughlin understudy , Father Edward Lodge Curran , Ph . D. , and the Sign , published by the Passionist Fathers , also belong in this group , as does Our Sunday Visitor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national circulation of more than 400,000 and wide distribution among young people . These papers have supported fascism not only in Spain but elsewhere . " Czechoslovakia Rises Again as a Christian State " was a front-page headline of the Brooklyn Tablet shortly after Munich , over a story reading in part : " Now freed from the foreign elements which had been foisted on to the Versailles-created republic , Czechoslo- , vakia as a federation is determined to build itself up as a Christian state . " On October 2 , 1938 , Our Sunday Visitor declared editorially , " Germany , Italy , and Japan  --  the so-called fascist nations  --  are allied in sympathy and cooperation  --  and this may be bad . But England , France , Russia , Czechoslovakia , and the United States are allied in a similar manner  --  and we believe this is worse . " The leader of this group is America , to which must be credited the growing influence of the Jesuit " line " in American Catholic publications , the desire to see here the sort of state advocated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Gil Robles , and created in Portugal by Salazar  --  that is , Catholic , or " integral , " democracy . These Catholic fascist movements flowered when papal diplomacy was in the hands of the present pope . Francis X. Talbot , S. J. , editor of America , wrote last year in Harold Steam 's symposium , " America Now , " this outline of the Catholic position : In the United States , then , the Catholic church recognizes the government established by the will of the people as wholly and undeniably legitimate ; demands that the Catholic communicants give free and unreserved allegiance to the government ; and pledges itself to uphold that government in every exigency , to the best of its ability . Nevertheless , the American Catholic , enthusiastically affirming that the American constitutional system of government is the best non-Catholic form yet devised , claiming , furthermore , that the American Declaration of Independence and Constitution were derived from Catholic sources , can declare in utter good faith that a government erected on the Leonine Leo XIII principles would be a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows America . A very few Catholic papers follow the New World , a provocative weekly with a virile and realistic approach to current problems that is sadly lacking in other Catholit progressive journals . The Commonweal , a national Catholic magazine of social and literary comment , which had been steadily edging deeper into reaction , in 1938 abandoned its right-wing position , but it has never approached the forthrightness of the New World . The Catholic The NATION Worker , hopeful and starry-eyed , has a good labor record and has distinguished itself by its continued opposition to Catholic neo-fascists . The Labor Leader , organ of the Association of Catholic Trade Unionists , is more realistic . The last two suffer from small circulations and are supported largely by those members of the clergy who feel that if the church does not take a more vigorous pro-labor stand it will lose the Workers . More significant than these lay experiments is the defense of union labor by diocesan papers like the New World , the Michigan ' Catholic of Detroit , and the Pittsburgh Catholic , all published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Register chain vigorously defended union labor last summer when Cleveland business men , headed by C. F. Burke of the General Tire and Rubber Company , protested against the labor activities of Catholic leaders . FASCISM , SPAIN , AND CHURCH POWER On international issues the Catholic press has always advocated whatever political course would further church power . It opposed American foreign intervention in support of the Hungarian Kossuth , a Protestant ; it favored intervention in behalf of the Catholics in Ireland and in Mexico . It has opposed extending the " Good Neighbor " spirit in Latin America for fear of spreading Protestantism . Father John La Farge , S. J. , declared in America ( January 14 , 1939 ) : The strongest bond of unity in this whole pan-American field is not economic or commercial interdependence but the Catholic faith which these nations possess in common with 20,000,000 citizens of the United States and over 4,000,000 in Canada . This bond of unity lies in our custody as Catholics . Is it not about time that we rouse ourselves and insist that American diplomacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the name of the church 's 20-odd million members the Catholic press has tried to bring American foreign policy into line with international Catholic policy even where that policy favored the fascist powers . A plain indication of the hierarchy 's tolerance for fascism was given by Bishop John Mark Gannon of Erie , chairman of the Press Department of the N. C. W. C. , in an address before the C. P. A. in New York on June 22 , 1939 . In Europe said Bishop Gannon we have five dictatorships : Russia , Germany , Turkey , Italy , and Portugal . Two of them , Russia and Turkey , are definitely hostile to Christianity and God . Two of them , Italy and Portugal , actually support by public tax the church in all its fields of endeavor . Germany likewise supports the church , but due to a secular tendency in recent years there is a definite but we hope temporary form of persecution of Christian leaders . The clearest expression of fascist sympathies in the Catholic press was its pro-Franco stand during the SpanDecember 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use that issue as a touchstone . The success of the campaign to retain the embargo on Spain was largely attributable to the unremitting pressure of the Catholic press . Pro-labor papers like the Michigan Catholic and the Pittsburgh Catholic espoused the anti-labor , pro-fascist cause in Spain . Only three Catholic periodicals  --  the Catholic Worker , the New World , and the Commonweal in the last months of the war  --  dared even suggest that Franco 's war was not a holy war . This unanimity was secured through the releases of the N. C. W. C. news service . Judged by any standard of modern journalism , the coverage of the war in Spain given by the official Catholic news agency must be considered one of the most dishonest efforts of our age . The Catholic press based its Spanish stand on the following points , all demonstrably false : ( 1 ) the Popular Front achieved victory in the February 16 , 1936 , elections through fraud and violence ; ( 2 ) immediately after the elections the left began with governmental connivance a reign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; ( 3 ) the murder of Calvo Sotelo by the government on July 13 provoked the Spanish people to rise ; ( 4 ) proof of a Communist plot to seize the government caused Franco to rise ; ( 5 ) Franco was supported by a majority Of the Spanish people ; ( 6 ) the Spanish government was fighting to impose communism on the Spanish people ; ( 7 ) Franco 's movement was not fascist ; ( 8 ) Franco accepted no German and Italian help until after the Soviet Union intervened in behalf of the Spanish government ; ( 9 ) the massacre at Badajoz never took place , the bombing of Guernica was a newspaperman 's fake , and the bombings of Barcelona and Valencia were confined to military objectives . The trump card of the Catholic press , however , was the lurid charge that the " anti-religious " Spanish government had killed 300,000 men , women , and children because they were Catholics . It is true that churches were burned and that priests , perhaps even nuns , were killed in Republican territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church press . That press , moreover , rarely pointed out that such outrages against the lives of priests as occurred took place after Franco had risen in revolt  --  in the name of the church  --  taking with him the bulk of the army and police power . There is no evidence to show governmental connivance in the crimes committed by an enraged people who thought the church was supporting a fascist movement  --  as indeed it was . The Catholic press never explained to democratic American Catholics why these things happened . It did not tell of the issue of the Catholic magazine Accien Espanola , published in Burgos in March , 1937 , with the benediction of the Cardinal Primate , which declared the justification for its politics to be that " democracy and universal suffrage were embryonic forms of communism and anarchy . " It did not tell how the Bishop of Pamplona677 had early in 1936 blessed the flag of the fascist Spanish Phalanx . It did not tell of the English Catholics , Jerrold and Pollard , who , acting on behalf of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canaries to Morocco . These facts , often published in Spain with the sanction of the church , were never revealed to American Catholics . Only a New World columnist had the courage to face the challenge to the Catholic press given by the German and Italian post-war revelations of aid to Franco . He wrote ( June 30 , 1939 ) : The accusations are now being made on every side that many Catholic writers and , unfortunately , most of the Catholic press were guilty of presenting falsehoods about the Spanish Civil War . . . . They are the more unfortunate because these writers and papers were continually accusing the-daily press of untruthfulness and unfairness , while they themselves did not have dean hands . It now appears that the daily press gave a more fair and accurate picture of the Spanish war than did many units of the Catholic press . The Catholic Review , archdiocesan organ of Baltimore , replied that " the isolation of the New World from the rest of the Catholic papers is complete . For that we are thankful . " Monsignor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diocesan organ : What we black sheep Catholic papers printed about the Spanish war was taken directly from the news releases of the National Catholic Welfare Conference or inspired by those releases . The National Catholic Welfare Conference is the creation and mouthpiece of the American bishops . If we were dishonest there is an inference to be drawn which all but the foolhardy will avoid . To defend its falsehoods on Spain the Catholic press attacked the publishers and correspondents of the secular press . Father Joseph F. Thorning , the most articulate of Franco 's propagandists , often pointed out that Pulitzer , Stern , Meyer , and Sulzberger were Jews , and therefore prejudiced against Franco . Jay Allen was attacked to discredit his story of the Badajoz massacre . G. L. Steer was assailed to tear down his story of the bombing of Guernica . Father Thorning libeled Lawrence Fernsworth by writing in the Tablet : The evidence of Mr. FernsWorth 's connections with the leftist government of Spain was gathered by agents of the British Foreign Office and led to his resignation from the Times ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matthews was called insane . Leland Stowe , Vincent Sheean , Ernest Hemingway , John Gunther , and others were constantly vilified . It is impossible to gauge with ' accuracy the power of this press . By no means does it reach even half the Catholics in this country . After two years of Catholic press enthusiasm for fascism in Spain , the Gallup poll in December , 1938 , reported that one-third of American Catholics had no opinion on the war , while 43 per cent of those with opinions were pro-Loyalist . The press did succeed , however , in molding a loud , militant pressure group which had tremendous effect on politicians . At the suggestion of Father Gillis , editor of the monthly Catholic World and author of a column widely circulated in the Catholic press , the Catholic Press Association in June adopted with only two dissenting votes a motion to rebuke all secular newspapers the C. P. A. believed guilty of reporting the Spanish war unfairly . This kind of Catholic pressure on the secular press is now organized in the United Catholic Organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. , of America , ON COUGHLIN AND THE WAR The most significant Catholic press development in recent months has been the increasing support for Coughlin . To the non-Catholic press Coughlin is perhaps known chiefly for his encouragement to anti-Semitism . But to the Catholic press he is the man who deluged Congress with telegrams against lifting the embargo on Spain , the man who led the fight ' against revision of the Neutrality Act . The N. C. W. C. news service sends out Coughlin 's speeches . The Tablet prints Coughlin 's speeches in full . The Catholic News , New York archdiocesan organ , prints weekly excerpts , as does the St. Louis Catholic . The Western Catholic , organ of the Springfield , Illinois , diocese , speaks of the " fearless , peerless Father Coughlin . " The Evangelist , Albany 's diocesan paper , defends Father Coughlin 's anti-Semitism with : Communism 's Enemy Number One in this country is Father Coughlin . In his sincere effort to expose its godless philosophy and harmful economic system he spares neither Jew nor Gentile . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reprints Coughlin and comments : But whatever men say , they can not truthfully and justly contend Father Coughlin lacks the courage to speak the truth as he sees it , and is convinced of it . And that is something big , just as the priest 's venture is big . Something all Americans should , in conformity with a fine tradition , admire , whether they subscribe to Father Coughlin 's view or not . Only two diocesan organs stand out in the fight against Coughlin  --  the New World and the Pittsburgh Catholic . Purely Catholic interests will determine the attitude of the church press on the present war as they have on other major issues . Monsignor Fulton J. Sheen , prominent American church spokesman , declared in England this past summer , " The majority of Catholics do not want the President to be giveri the right to declare who is an ' aggressor , ' lest it be used against the church as it would have been used against it in Spain if such a right were then enjoyed . " There are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within wheels . A recent report received from Rome indicated a 40 per cent decrease in papal revenues since the invasion of Poland . The prime financial importance of the United States church to the Vatican and the fact that the New World Catholic population now equals that of the Old , may cause the church to continue its " isolationist " stand . Nevertheless , there are , some signs that a shift is in the making . If all the guns can be turned against Soviet Russia , the church press may well clamor for our participation in a " holy War . " Yet the church is wary . John P. Delaney , writing in America ( October 14 ) , says : This is not yet a religious war . Before it can become such , we must have some assurance that the men and nations who are directing the war are primarily interested in the preservation of religious liberty . Thus far , we have no such assurance . Another factor that will contribute to the formation of the Catholic " line " is the articulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic hierarchy and press . England , with its apostate state ' church , and anti-clerical France are viewed with disfavor by many American clerics . Also , the church would not favor any coalition , even against Soviet Russia , that might result in an international body not dominated by the church , for international organizations are the special foes of the church , be they Socialist , Communist , Masonic , or leagues of nations . Patrick Scanlan , managing editor of the Tablet , summed up the Catholic editor 's position , as far as it can be summed up , on April 1 , 1939 : The question for us is : Who is for God and who is against God ? Who favors religion , who is against it ? Who will protect and uphold God 's rights , defend His church , and oppose anti-God ? That is the all-important issue . Nothing else matters a great deal . Democracy ? Truth ? Liberty ? Fraternity ? Equality ? " Nothing else matters a great deal . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
