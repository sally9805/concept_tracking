THE TRUANT A STORY BY SARAH-ELIZABETH RODGER If I should die . Virginia 's pulse and breath Would die with me. 0 hills and trees and sky And red Virginian roads , can there be death Noble enough for son of yours to die ? y OU can not be free even from a dead man when he has left you a little gray book . Virginia looked at it and wondered why she did not steal into the kitchen and thrust it into the big coal stove . Anthony 's poems were a kind of drug . They held her in the hammock through the long summer afternoons , sitting while the slow tears gathered uncertainly , knowing she was being watched , feeling the eyes of her mother 's friends who were sipping tea on the veranda . They smiled at her with loving pity . " I declare , Mattie , Virginia 's been so brave , but how can you-all bear that haunted look in her eyes ? " They were always careful to explain her to strangers . After the strangers had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Confederacy clubhouse , they had to see Virginia . " That 's Virginia Clay , Anthony Powell 's fiancee  --  you know , the famous young poet who was killed in the Argonne . Of course the poor child 's life is ruined , but she 's been so brave in spite of that tragic look ! Noblesse oblige . . . . The Clays are one of our finest old families , you know ? " Virginia knew she looked tragic and that her eyes drooped inshadows and seemed to raise themselves only with a supreme effort to carry on . Her family , her friends , and her native State thought it very beautiful and plaintive of her . Of course , they could not know that in four years plaintiveness grows to be a habit . " If he had died any other way , " she thought . " If it could have been in an accident , or pneumonia , or a drunken brawl . . . . Oh , why did it have to be at the head of a regiment with flags flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anthony Powell must look noble and beautiful till the last moment when the troopship had sailed , and if lie had bad to lead men over trenches till be fell face forward , then why the gray book ? After you had escaped from the flags and the little cross they sent you , and even the empty , pricked-balloon feeling inside of you , you found yourself hedged in and limited by words and words and more words bound in a small oblong of paper . That was the unfairness of it . But this was the day Virginia was going to break away from Anthony . She straightened up and raised her eyebrows to help make her feel skeptical . After all , Anthony had been so young when he wrote all these  --  and there was a war and he had died in it . Perhaps that had blinded the critics when they called him " America 's Greatest War Poet , whose tender , splendid answer to the call of death will stand forever as the very spirit of his native Virginia and all young America . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she were only able . She would read every poem through and feel perfectly impersonal about it and then she would hide this book away where she would never see it again  --  and then , perhaps , she would send for Randolph . She turned the pages efficiently , as one would handle a work on economics . On that pale day when we are old , Will dogwood bud and suns drip gold ? Will this high whiteness stay unbroken , The song unsung , the words unspoken ? She shivered and held her chin tense . Anthony had made that verse with his head in her lap , droning it sleepily up at the lazy spring sky . There were other girls who had to remember holding a man 's head in their arms before he went to war  --  and then their arms were empty . But their moments had never been put into words . Everything she and Anthony had ever had was crystallized into Anthony 's verse . She reflected that there was never any privacy for a poet . The hill we loved is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red at dawn , And this year 's leaves are cool and frail as last 's Nothing is gone . There was the hill , looming large at the back of the garden . And Anthony had gone on , unkindly insistent : If next year 's leaves are less bright , if the wind Less tenuously blows your hair And I am gone  --  you still shall find our hill Magnificently there . . . Virginia closed the book , shut her eyes , and threw with all her might . It must have landed in the tall grass in the field next to the garden , but she did not stop to look . She ran up on the veranda , through the screen door , and into the front hall . Her mother was coming down the stairs with Miss Myra Wilkins . Their arms were intertwined like girls ' , and Virginia , watching them , wondered if thinking of oneself as a girl made one stay a girl any longer . Miss Myra came to her at once , squeezing her shoulder nervously . Her voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Virginia , or if there was illness in a house . Miss Myra smelled faintly of chalk and erasers , and she spoke in sentences that contained clearly defined subjects and predicates , unless she were a little excited . " I was just saying to Mattie I wanted to see you , honey . . " Virginia 's mother chimed in with the effect of an echo or an afterthought . " Yes , Miss Myra has something to tell you , Ginny . " The two women hovered about her as they took their chairs in the sitting room . They always made Virginia feel very patient and old . The darkened room , with the blinds drawn against the heat , and the pitcher of lemonade on the table seemed a part of this momentous day when she was going to break off her patience as cleanly as one cuts a thread . Miss Myra was wielding her palm-leaf fan in short little jerks . She was telling Virginia that she must n't be prejudiced . " I 've been so anxious to talk to you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden at your blessed communion ! " " My  --  my what ? " " With Anthony , I mean ? " She leaned forward , pink-faced and determined , " Oh , I know about your beautiful moments with Anthony 's soul , darling . . . . But I was just telling your mother about this new comfort for you . The lady  --  we call her Madame  --  is so anxious to help you . She 's been so marvelous with Cousin Lulu THE TRUANT 727 Eaton , and there 's nothing in the least coarse about her . I mean , she 's a lady , but in reduced circumstances . She says it 's all just in concentration and tuning one 's soul to the deceased . " Virginia fought back the desire to stop the rising and falling cadences of Miss Myra 's voice . She fought not to scream . Afterwards , she wondered if she would really have gone to the telephone in the hall if it had not been for Miss Myra telling her about Madame . Miss Myra waited for encouragement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my dear , and I felt it my duty to run right over and tell you about it . She got a message from Cousin Lulu 's little boy who died all those years ago from the mumps . I was telling her just a little about dear Anthony , and she said undoubtedly the sensitive poet soul was easier  --  for communication . " Virginia rose suddenly . She looked about her for an escape . " Miss Myra  --  mother  --  I know you 'll both excuse me , but I feel just a little ill . " Again they hovered . They Look it for granted that she felt ill . They expected her to be in delicate health . Her mother said she knew Ginny had n't been really well or strong since poor Anthony  --  passed away . She said it with a proud smile , and Virginia found herself trembling for fear she would add her favorite and only French phrase , " C'esi la guerre . " Miss Myra patted her shoulder helpfully and suggested that even when happiness was lost there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dabbing quickly at her eyes with a small lace handkerchief , asked Virginia if it was n't any comfort to know that Anthony died to make the world safe for womanhood and high ideals ? Virginia stood very still . " Please . I want to tell you something . I'mthrough with all this . I 'm putting it a million miles behind me . " They were n't listening . She knew they would n't listen while they could hover and commiserate . So , quietly , she walked away from them into the hall and picked up the telephone . She gave the number and spoke to Randolph Kincaid very clearly . " You told me to call you when I had changed my mind , Randolph . Yes , I mean it . Will you come this evening ? Please . my dear , do n't shout so ! Good-by . " Then she went back to her mother , who was whimpering in mortification : " Oh , Virginia , how could you ? " Miss Myra did not speak at all . She looked at Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mother knows your life is ruined , but you ca n't marry that Kincaid boy just to forget . You know you 'll never forget ! " Virginia looked at her curiously and said , " Suppose I told you that I love Randolph ? " Mattie Clay sat down weakly on the stairs . " Of course you do n't , not after poor Anthony died for all of us . You 're just pretending and you 're naturally stubborn like your father 's family . You do n't care what happens to your-self ! " " Is Randolph as bad as that , mother ? " " It is n't poor Randolph . He 's a sweet boy , but when I think of  --  of Anthony 's lovely p-p-poetry . . " Miss Myra sat beside her and patted her plump shoulder , darting reproachful glances at Virginia . Mattie pursued the subject and brought it on to the sacredness of love . " Love is something besides sacredness , I should think , " said Virginia . The ladies rose at that . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Myra gently , as she explained the theory of fractions to a small and slow pupil . " Not the pure , wonderful devotion you and Anthony had ! " " It was n't always so particularly pure . Anthony was just like other people . " Mattie looked at her daughter as if she had some strange disease . This smacked strongly of slander of the dead . But Virginia 's eyes never wavered in their guarded calm , and at last her mother looked away and , in desperation , tried to repair the damage . She began to talk brightly to Miss Myra of other things , both of them ignoring Virginia as she slowly left the room . On her way upstairs she heard them whispering , but it seemed to be about someone 's premature baby . In her room Virginia sighed with relief . Her mother would take this badly , but in the end it would be all right . She knew her mother . Slowly and by degrees , it would be let known that Virginia had n't really encouraged Anthony until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was so devoted . ... And Randolph and Virginia had played together as children . . . . Perhaps it was going to be easier than she had thought . After she had dressed for dinner she sat by her window- and looked at the hill behind the garden . It reminded her of Anthony , but mostly on account of the poem ; somehow she must make it Randolph 's hill . As she went downstairs , she took Anthony 's picture from her bureau and carried it with her into the living room . If she were going to marry Randolph it would be more decent on the piano . She did n't think of destroying it . People did not destroy pictures of old lovers when the old lovers had died for democracy . Nor was there much else of Anthony that she could destroy . Instead of love letters and pressed flowers from corsages , she had thepoems of his pen , and the poems were published in a small gray book . Granting that she should make a blasphemous blaze of her own copy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had one . For a moment she felt uneasy . There were guests to dinner , and Virginia was glad she was not expected to talk much to them . After these years of practice , it was easier to look spiritual than to keep up a conversation and you had more time to eat . She let her long lashes droop , with the quiet , assured enjoyment of one who is certain of being the center of the stage with no personal effort . When the salads came on she roused herself enough to listen for Randolph 's step on the street outside . Her father and the Rector were arguing about theology , and she thought they might he quieter about it . " I tell you , Clay , the hope of immortality is the glory of the human race . " Where was Randolph , and could she just slip away before they all took second helpings of shortcake ? The Rector leaned over suddenly and patted Virginia 's hand . " I reckon this little lady has found her comfort in the Great Promise ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorously to polish his glasses . She was disturbed at feeling the old , accustomed little thrill of having people think her formed of rarer clay than the majority of mankind . She had not minded so much losing her mother 's and Miss Myra 's gentle worship , but she wondered how it would be when this kind , sentimental man no longer looked appreciatively down at her from his pulpit when he was stressing a spiritual point . Then she heard the sound she was waiting for . Outside two hi g feet were clumping up and down the veranda . She knew that all the rocking chairs on the verandas up and down the darkening street had stopped , to watch who THE TRUANT 7i9 was calling on Virginia Clay . With a swift movement she excused herself , dropped her napkin , and ran from the table . She drew a deep breath and went out on the veranda with both hands outstretched . This would give them something to talk about , and in the moment between opening and shutting the screen door she wondered what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage in braving so many tongues . It was like going through fire and water to meet one 's lover , but once with Randolph , she would have a wall to lean against . His sturdiness and the ordinary , sane thoughts in his mind would free her forever from Anthony 's poetic vagaries . All her future stretched out simple and matter of fact , her physical needs paid for by Randolph 's hydraulic pumps , and her mental needs satisfied by Randolph 's glorious common sense . Randolph , clean , scrubbed , and in white flannels , was quite breathless as be took her hands and held them tight against his coat . It was later , in the garden on the path to the hill , that he caught her wrist suddenly and turned her round . " Look here . You mean this , do n't you ? " His eyes looked at the same time ecstatic and terrified . It reminded her of him as a little boy when he had seen a pie on a pantry window sill and was desperately afraid he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been . He was six , and she was eight and a little taller , so she had reached for it , after maddening deliberation , and handed it down to him . It made her laugh to think of it . She looked up at his mouth , which was so far above hers , and her hands crept to the back of his neck and pulled his head down . . . . She was glad his tight clasp was awkward , glad that he seemed to know nothing of the artistic or poetic possibilities of holding her like this . She clung to him with a four years ' hunger . " Blessed ! " he murmured unsteadily against her cheek . She stirred then and was vaguely annoyed that all men called one Blessed . But he was kissing her again , and she forgot . It was on Tuesday that Virginia sent for Randolph . On Thursday she met no one she knew when she went downtown . On Saturday the Rector 's wife did not happen to see her when she was buying ribbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table troubled her because her mother talked a great deal , and her father was silent behind his paper . Open disapproval always gave Virginia a queer feeling in the pit of her stomach . " I do n't see exactly what I 've done , " she said . " What is it ? " Her father said it was nothing that could be explained to her if she did n't know herself . Her mother suggested to her father that all this was probably just a beautiful unselfishness on Virginia 's part , a desire to bring happiness to another by sacrifice of self . She looked eagerly at Virginia while she said it . " No , mother . I want to marry Randolph . " Her father 's mouth straightened as if she had said something the least bit vulgar . Miss Myra called once to talk to her , on the strength of having taught her in the seventh grade . " And I never saw anything in your character , never once , to make me believe you could do anything that was  --  well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaguely to a discussion of what was the kindest way to tell Randolph all was over . Miss Myra thought it would be impossible for her to be a sacrifice to a man 's selfish love . " You 've been such a beautiful lesson to us all these years . . " Then she lowered her voice and fumbled with her library card . " Besides , men are  --  well , you ask your dear mother ? Men expect things , and you with your spiritual temperament and love of poetry and all . You could n't stand being sacrificed when it came down to reality , Virginia ! " Miss Myra blushed furiously and wondered if she had said too much . Virginia wanted to laugh . She ached with wanting to laugh . She thought of Randolph and his brown eyes with a funny little gleam behind them , Randolph and his broad shoulders . and the way his fair hair grew high on his forehead . It was something she had to explain to Miss Myra , or Miss Myra might die without ever knowing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privilege ! Randolph , " she paused dramatically , " is six feet tall in his stocking feet . " She looked up and saw that Miss Myra was wounded to the depths of her virgin soul , and that she was leaving the room with an air of washing her hands . Virginia felt uneasy . She started to call her back and ( lid not dare . She walked about the room restlessly , feeling as the Venus de Milo must feel if , tiring of immortality , she had stepped down from her pedestal and exposed herself to the human gossip of ladies more fully clothed . She remembered that she had n't seen Jane Elizabeth Palmer for a week , and she suddenly wanted to see someone young . She felt an old familiar craving for approval . She wanted to be admired for breaking loose , as she had been admired for bearing her broken heart . Jane Elizabeth looked up to her and thought her just a bit more beautiful and interesting than other people . Virginia put on her hat and walked leisurely down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yoo-hooed till Jane Elizabeth came slowly down the stairs . " Hello . " " Hello there . I 'm walking downtown to the Library , Jane Elizabeth . Come along ? " " All right . I have to take the trolley out to play golf at the Club anyway . " They walked together down the shady street . Jane Elizabeth was very quiet and did n't congratulate her on her engagement . Perhaps it was conceited to suppose the whole town had beard about it . Perhaps Jane Elizabeth had n't known , " I 'm going to be married , Jane Elizabeth  --  to Randolph Kincaid . I 've been wanting to tell you . " There was a long moment of silence . " I 'd heard . Congratulations . " Jane Elizabeth 's tone was light and a little contemptuous . " It 's funny , Jane Elizabeth , " Virginia spoke very slowly , " I thought you might understand  --  you of all the people I know . Nobody else does . " The expression on Jane Elizabeth 's small rouged mouth was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Virginia said with dignity , " I happen to love Randolph . " " No , you do n't ! " Jane Elizabeth 's voice was not flippant any more . It was desperately in earnest . " You do n't ! You love Anthony , and he wrote poetry to you and was killed in the War ! " Her eyes were wide , and Virginia noticed tears in them . " What makes you feel like that ? " " Never mind . But you never could care for anyone as you did for Anthony  --  you just could n't ! He said you never could , do n't you remember ? It was the one toward the end of the book : " Nor shall you ever find escape from me , Beloved , nor gainsay me when I call  --  For I shall be a shadow on your wall On sharp blue midnights . You will not be free . " Jane Elizabeth 's voice sank to a whisper . " It 's as if he knew he was going . " Then she pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't to have spoken like that when it is n't my business . " " It does n't matter . " They walked into town in silence , and Virginia watched Jane Elizabeth climb on the trolley , her white-flannel skirt parting company a moment with her chiffon stocking-tops . She felt lonely and hot and tired when she walked back home . She tried to find satisfaction the rest of the afternoon in doing her hair different ways . She was glad she had kept it long . Were you less mocking , I would dare To hold my face against your hair  --  And play with it and pull it down , And kiss each wisp for being brown ! There was Anthony 's verse again . She thought of it with a growing resentment . It was insulting of him to have written things she could n't forget . There were corner loafers who kissed and told  --  and there were poets . It was the same thing really . But she was to meet Randolph on the hill at eight . The hill behind the garden was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that out long ago , or Anthony had . Damn Anthony ! Thank Ikaven , Randolph could never remind her of him . No two people could be more utterly different . Randolph could love her without the intrusion of iambic pentameter . She walked very slowly up the path . It was purely habit that she walked slowly . She was quite mad to see Randolph , but she had walked up this path dozens of times and each time slowly . When you come slowly , you arc dusk and shadow , Glory and grief eternal , all for me ; God meant you to come slowly , me for impatience , Alert to snatch my immortality . It was from habit , too , that she whistled a Bob White at the sixth pine tree . Afterwards , she thought if only it could have been even at the seventh pine tree she would have been less vulnerable to reminiscence . Randolph came running down the hill . " Blessed ! " It crossed her mind again how intensely she disliked being called that . But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and remembered that he , Randolph , was an engineer and probably did not know that a sonnet was fourteen lines of iambic pentameter . He kissed her , and she quivered with a desire for him to tell her about ditches and hydraulic pumps . After this she would like to be married to him and make him biscuits and sew on his buttons . For a moment life seemed as simple as that . They sat down under a tree to rest , and Randolph asked her when she would marry him . " I do n't know . When ought we ? " " Soon ! " She leaned against his hard shoulder and felt completely happy . They did not speak , and for several minutes they watched a small brown chipmunk clamber along a branch with a nut in his cheek . " I like chipmunks . They 're so sane . Like you , Randolph . " " I 'm not sane , not now . " " Yes , you are . You 're an engineer . " " I 'm not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even any identity . " She stole a glance up at him and discovered with alarm that he was serious . He was so serious that his eyes were half closed , and he held to her hand till it hurt . " If I 'm anything , I 'm an immortal  --  loving you . . . " She felt let down and betrayed and she shook him angrily . " Do n't say those things . I hate it . You do n't love me like that . " She did not want to be loved like that  --  again . He got up obediently when she suggested that they climb the rest of the way , but his eyes were still dreamy and unlike him , and something was spoiled . She could not think what . But she recalled Anthony 's " Lines to a Goddess " and shivered . Randolph looked down at her and suddenly swung her up in his arms , carrying her up the path in triumph . " You do n't have to walk up hills when I 'm here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't worry . I sha n't drop you . You 're precious to me , Virginia , do n't you know it ? " Something quoted itself across her mind . You are more dear than sun or moon or stars , And more astute than any prescient leaf Under the whirring wind . You are more holy Than the white stain of dim-remembered grief . She faced Randolph tensely . Now that she knew what was bothering her , it was better to have it out at once . " Randolph , please do n't call me precious  --  or holy  --  or anything like that , ever ! Can you remember not to ? " He smiled at her and said nothing , and they walked a little way in comradeship , swinging hands . She felt warm with contentment . When he slipped his arm about her waist she stopped and let him hold her . " Of course you 're precious to me , modest little thing . " He whispered against her cheek , " You 're holy and everything true and beautiful  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  all that . " Randolph 's tanned young face was red , and his eyes looked as they did in church , but less restrained . . She tried to pull away , but he held her and buried his face in her soft throat . It crystallized her uneasiness into a sudden sharp memory of Anthony 's well-known " Nocturne on a Hill . " " Stop it , Randolph . You ca n't kiss my throat ! " He stirred obediently , with a little murmur , and closed her eyelids with his lips . . . and my kisses pass Your lashes in recurrence , as winds blow Quickeningly over separate blades of grass . " Stop . You ca n't kiss my eyes either ! " Randolph stared . " Where the Hell can I kiss you ? " It was too much , and she was half laughing and half crying . This was what she had been afraid of for days  --  waking up and remembering . " Nowhere . Anthony has written poems about everything . Oh , Randolph , he even made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , ' boat , dote , coat , goat , ' but he used ' remote . ' " He was growing frightened and thought she could n't be well . She felt perfectly well but she wanted to recite lines and lines of verse out of her bitterness . She wanted to find flaws in it in order to punish Anthony for spoiling everything she tried to do . " Listen , Randolph . You do n't read poetry , but if you did , you 'd remember : " Let love be beautiful . So brief a time Is there for loving . All the green of spring Is transient , as this high and perfect thing ? " Randolph , terrified , put a hand over her mouth . " Stop , please stop , darling . You 're sick or tired or something . " " No , I 'm not . " The oppression of the last few days surged up within her . The dark and formless things about her bed when she wanted to sleep and dream of Randolph resolved themselves into quatrains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just ca n't stand being spied on . " Randolph patted her shoulder and said nobody was spying on them . " Do n't cry like that . " " I 'm not crying , I 'm laughing . " She gulped . " Ca n't you see how funny it is  --  that Anthony 's book should be like a third person hanging about us ? " Randolph could n't see . He should have talked as fast as he could about being married and where they would live and how many children they would have , but he did not know that . His brown eyes were anxious for his frail divinity , and he kept on patting her clumsily . Finally , when she did not stop crying , he wrapped his coat around her and led her down the path . " I 'm going to take you home . " She relaxed against his arm , letting him guide her , and wondered if she might not feel better in the morning . He had said she was tired , and she felt tired . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the katydids . In a quick impulse of gratitude for his silence , she ran her hand up his shoulders and over his straight hair . He caught the hand and held it against his lips . " When you touch me , all of a sudden like that , it 's  --  it 's a benediction , " he said breathlessly . " All that I know of holiness or grace Comes when these fragile fingers touch my face .. . " She had said it out loud without thinking , and now there were little hammers beating at her temples for horror and shame . It was no use . " You see how it is , Randolph . Go away . I ought to have known before . " Mother and Miss Myra and Jane Elizabeth did not know the real reason , but they had known that she could never marry Randolph . She saw themall telling her how wise she was to stop before it was too late . She saw them  --  through some sick , shameful eye in her mind  --  hovering over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all their adoration , and she would be vile enough to be comforted . The boy who had always flunked his English courses , and tinkered with old engines in his back yard , and could kiss one breathless without saying a single word had gone away and deserted her . This Randolph , who stammered familiar things , could not help her to fight against poems . " You can see how it is , Randolph . . , " He did not move , and she knew he could not really understand . " Go away , Randolph . I 'm sorry . " He still did not move , and she told him to go before she screamed . " I ca n't , " he said miserably , " and if I did , I 'd come back to-morrow and the next day and the day after that . You ca n't send me off like this without any reason . " " Reason ? Oh , my God , Randolph . is n't it reason enough when we ca n't spend an hour together alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt too tired to resist when he took her in his arms . " We are alone . " His voice sank to its new solemnity again . " Darling , darling . .. I can feel your heart beat . . . " She drew away , uncomforted . " Yes . I could feel your heart  --  but that 's been written about too . " Loathing herself , she remembered the exact place . " On page 19 of Anthony 's book . " Randolph was stung to anger , and it made him shout . " Ca n't we ever forget those damn ' poems ? " She was sorry for him but she said , " I do n't think so . They 're in every anthology , and I 'm even rather proud of them . " In saying it , she discovered that it was true . " Have n't you ever read the book , To You , Virginia ? " Her laughter broke in the middle and she caught her breath . " He meant me and not this States but everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unclenched his fists and could not think of anything to say . He mumbled that he 'd better go . They had reached the garden , and she stumbled over something . Bending , she picked up the dew-drenched little gray book . " I could show you if the light were better . " " Do n't . I 'm going . " Randolph 's hatred of poets and poetry was born and grew to maturity in an hour . It was something he could not alter or do anything about . She put her hand in his , and it felt hot and dry . " Yes , please go . It 's the only way . I 'm sorry , Randolph . " He started to leave and turned back . " No , I wo n't go ! " he said belligerently , and just as belligerently , " I love you . " " I love you too , underneath . I love you enough to do mopping and scrubbing for you and stand pain and be bored  --  but not enough to stand this  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He stepped toward her , but she evaded him . She felt as if the ground were sinking gradually under her feet , and she hated her mind because it was busy and alert when she wanted everything to go black . " No . We ca n't be in love because Anthony 's poems are the whole story . He  --  he always wrote everything down ... " She reached for her handkerchief . " There , wo n't you please go now ? " " And leave you like this ? I 'd keep coming back ? " " Not if I asked you not to . If I asked you , for my sake , to go away and never come back , you 'd go away and you 'd never come back . " He kept kissing her fingers . " We belong to each other . It 's as if there were n't anybody else in the world ? " " He wrote about that , too . " She quoted softly : " And so we two have shut the world without ; Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took her up on her veranda , pushed her gently through the screen door , and walked away . He walked with his hands in his pockets and his head bent , miles along the state highway to Richmond . He was quite , quite drunk when they found him , as the Rector 's wife told the Ladies ' Aid , though of course the Kincaids had never held their liquor . The Ladies ' Aid were not surprised . They all knew Virginia Clay would never marry Randolph Kincaid . In the end she would find she could not run away from the one great love of her life . . . And Anthony 's beautiful poetry had just taken another posthumous prize .
