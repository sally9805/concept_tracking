Of the numerous U. S. localities which maintain open-air summer concerts , only the Hollywood Bowl pretentiously labels its performances " Symphonies Under the Stars . " One night last week Peggy Wood , Marlene Dietrich , Josef von Sternberg , Jeanette MacDonald , Corinne Griffith and some 18,000 others heard Otto Klemperer play Beethoven , Wagner , Debussy , Al-beniz , Berlioz in the Bowl 's opener . Conductors to follow during the eight-week season : Willem Mengelberg , Ernest Schelling , Bernardino Molinari , Jos Iturbi . <P> From the Hollywood Bowl last week many an auditor glanced up at a hill 1,000 ft. away where , once an evening , a spot light picked out a man in a flowing robe stumbling along with a cross . In an out door theatre beneath the hill was being performed the Pilgrimage Play , a 15-year-old event in California . Compiled by the late Christine Wetherill Stevenson , a rich Bible student who left money to assure its performance , the Pilgrimage Play presents the entire life of Christ . The actors , like Ian Maclaren who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The director is Phil Whiting , professional Los Angeles pageant producer . A hidden orchestra plays softly , voices chant ancient church music . The Pilgrimage Play goes on nightly for ten weeks . <P> When Nijinsky , Karsavina , Rubinstein danced in the peerless Diaghilev Ballet , it was more often than not to works created by Michel Fokine . Today Fokine runs a dancing school in Manhattan . His dancers , who bolstered a faltering season last summer at the Lewisohn Stadium , were again sent to its rescue this month . They performed old Fokine favorites , introduced some new ballets . By this week , when they were to wind up the engagement , the Fokine dancers had impressed critics as no more than mediocre . There was , however , one exception-22-year-old Paul Haakon ( pronounced hawk-on ) . In Scheherazade he was a lithe Favorite . Slave . In Les Sylphides he was the sole male dancer , pirouetting classically in white tights and black blouse . In Dukas ' The Sorcerer 's Apprentice he was an exuberant Broom , bounding about until he ripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Le Spectre de la Rose , the role which Nijinsky made his own , Haakon managed to be swift and sure " in the soaring leaps . <P> Born in Fredericia , Denmark and orphaned early , Paul Haakon Longreen was adopted by Christ Nielson Panduoro , a bachelor who had made money in the embroidery business . Christ Panduoro took Paul Haakon to San Francisco , had him study dancing for his health although the boy disliked it . When they returned to Denmark the 9-year-old was put in the Royal Opera Ballet School . The " elevation " ( leaps and jumps ) at which he is expert today he learned in the rigorous oldtime manner , practicing in heavy harness which when it was removed made him feel more airy . In 1924 Christ Panduoro lost his money , returned to San Francisco to begin again in the embroidery business . Paul Haakon studied with Theodore Kosloff , made his debut in a San Francisco vaudeville house . In 1927 in Manhattan he danced as a faun in Cleopatra , managed to get in Pavlova 's troupe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
