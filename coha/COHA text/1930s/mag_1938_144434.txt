Gathered last week in Mrs. Robertson 's Shady Lawn Tourist Camp outside of Nashville , Tenn. was one of the South 's most talkative , most anachronistic minority groups-500 itinerant Irish horse traders , the Rileys and Costellos , the O'Haras , Carrolls and Sherlocks . During the winter they travel round from one mule market to another , running down the animals of other people and commenting enthusiastically on the good points of their own . During the summer they live in tourist camps and see the world . Once a year , on May 1 . they get together just outside of Nashville for the festive Irish purpose of burying their dead . <P> Bridget and Katie Costello , Jimmy Carroll , Jimmy McNally , Petie and Bridget Riley had died in various Southern towns since May 1 , 1937 . Their bodies had been shipped to undertakers in the vicinity , to be kept against the next spring buryings . When the last April mule market closed , the Irishmen put their families into their cars , mostly new ones with trailers , and set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are not a clan , just a large group of countrymen with a common trade . No one knows how the meetings started , but they have been going on for 50 years . Last week , after appropriate ceremonies , the Irishmen deposited their six bodies in the Mt . Calvary cemetery , had a small drop to celebrate the occasion , broke up till May 1 , 1939.
