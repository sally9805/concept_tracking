txt Reports that an important announcement would be made soon followed a White House conference today attended by Attorney General CumImings , Secretary Morgenthau , So ' licitor General Reed and Herman Oliphant , general counsel of the Treasury Department . At first it had been rumored that , the meeting dealt with taxes and monetary questions , but when the President was asked at his press ' conference if this was so , he replied in the negative . All the officials involved refused to discuss what had taken place , leaving the field wide open to speculation . Interest was lent to the situation by announcement that the plans of the President for a week-end cruise to Jefferson Island had been canceled . The official explanation was that this was made advisable by an accumulation of " paper work " in the executive offices since Mr. Roosevelt returned from Hyde Park on Wednesday . President May , Attend Regatta . The President will remain at the White House except for a possible short motor trip Sunday afternoon , it was said . He hopes , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend a regatta at New London , Conn . Officials of the Internal Revenue Bureau were consulted following the White House meeting , it was said , and this gave rise to rumors that the conference had dealt with some new step contemplated along the lines of the efforts of the government to obtain a heavy additional income tax collection from Andrew W. Mellon , former Secretary of the Treasury . The Treasury and its Internal Revenue Bureau are also confronted by a new development in connection with invalidation of the gold clause contracts in government securities . In some quarters it is felt that this might bring a decision to end , as far as possible , all uncertainty as to the government 's position by legislation to close the Court of Claims to those seeking redress . In several instances , it is said , Treasury notes falling due on June 15 have been turned in to collectors of Internal Revenue in various cities with the request that they be accepted in payment of income taxes at the . gold value of the dollar on a pre-devaluation basis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes , issued in 1932 , are the last government obligations of that character into which the gold clause was written and Robert Jackson , a Washington attorney , recently evolved the plan of making another test case by having demands made that the notes be received at their old gold value when used for income-tax payments . It was said at the Treasury a report already had been received from one collector , whose identity was not revealed , that , a Treasury note for $1,000 had been offered as payment of $1,690 in taxes , and there were unofficial reports that similar action had been taken in other cities , including New York . The original plan as proposed by Mr. Jackson was to make the payment in this form , as well as any additional assessment , and then bring suit against the collector as an individual to recover . The Internal Revenue Bureau on June 4 , with the approval of Secretary Morgenthau , gave recognition to this situation by instructing collectors to receive such notes only at par ; to refuse to receive any of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instances where the attempt was made to have the notes received at $1.69 to the dollar , to forward the taxpayers ' returns to Washington so ? they may be gone over carefully . Many Notes Paid on Taxes . Treasury officials appear confident that any attempt to recover from the - government , except through the Court of Claims , will prove futile , and that in the end action must be brought there . This gave some substance to rumors that legislation might be contemplated which would , in the opinion of the President and his advisers , end all uncertainty . While the cases in which the demand actually has been made that I the Treasury notes be received at their old gold value in payment of taxes involve - relatively small amounts , a considerable volume of the outstanding $416,000,000 of the notes has been used for tax payments , and these also would be brought into the picture if the demands which have been made were upheld . Even the intimation by the White House that tax legislation was not discussed today did not completely end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an inheritance tax program . This was first suggested by Secretary Morgenthau as a way in which to raise cash to meet immediate . payment of the soldiers ' bonus , and there have been reports that , although bonus legislation was defeated , such a program would go to Congress as a broad administration policy . Debt Question Ruled Out . With Congress already saddled with " must " proposals which promise to stretch out the session at least until Aug. 1 , there has been a feeling recently that the administration would hold off at this time from a controversial subject such as inheritance tax legislation . The fact that no State Department representative was present at today 's conference appeared to limit the possibility that any move of an international character , having to do with war debts or currency stabilization , had been weighed . There was no definite information hinting at any departure in the silver policy . The Treasury is now conducting its purchases abroad gradually , as the metal is offered at a price felt to be satisfactory ; and agitation for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporarily , in Congress .
