txt // fore , more effective when a sustained pull is needed rather than when speed or distance is essential . The most frequent type of lever found in the body is represented in Fig. 126 , the third-order lever . The positions of force and weight have been interchanged with those of the second order , and the advantage is of speed . It is well to remember that when speed is gained force is sacrificed . Flexion of the forearm represents the type . The hand or any object held in it is the weight ; force is exerted by the contraction of the muscle on the front of the arm ( the biceps ) ; and the fulcrum is the elbow joint ( Fig. 126 ) . Levers of this type are always used for speed rather than great power . As in levers of the first order , the relationship between speed and power is governed by the proportionate length of the lever arms ; that is , by the relationship between the distance FP and PW . Fig. 127 illustrates the condition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both diagrams and that each contracts one-quarter inch . As the point of attachment in the right diagram is twice as far from the fulcrum as it is in the left , twice as much force must be used in the latter lever , but the weight will be moved approximately twice as far in the same length of time and the speed will be twice as great . From the above it will readily be seen that the length of ' bones and the point of attachment of muscles are controlling factors in any consideration of the power and speed of muscular movements . Such differences are apparent in the different groups of vertebrates and in individuals of the same species . In man , for example , there is a wide variation in body shape , length of ' long bones , and the points of muscle attachment . If , therefore , two individuals are equal in muscular development and coordinations , the differences between their strength and speed will be determined by these anatomical factors and the resultant leverage . As mentioned in the discussion of origin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anchorage in the animal . This change is illustrated by the pull of the gastroenemius ( Fig. 1 25 B ) . If the fulcrum is shifted from the ball of the foot to the joint between the tibia and the caleaneus of the tarsus , as when the heel is raised and the floor is tapped with the foot , the sane ' // muscular pull becomes a lever of the first order . Similar cases occur whenever the anchorage is shifted . Thus a monkey may stand on the ground and pull the limb of a tree downward , the point of anchorage being the ground ; or he may hold a stronger limb and pull his body upward , the tree becoming the point of anchorage and his body the weight to be lifted . Essentially the same muscles are brought into play , although the weights and levers have been reversed . Muscle groups are named for their most prominent function , although at times their action may be different . For example , the muscles on the palmar ( ventral ) side of the forearm are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side are the extensors because their major function is to straighten an angle caused by the contraction of the flexor group . But when the hand is flexed at the wrist the extensors may draw it into the position of a straight angle and then continue until the hand is in a position of dorsal flexion . C. AXIAL MUSCLES Amphioxus has the simplest possible arrangement of the axial muscles . Each segment is approximately equal to every other and is a V-shaped band extending from the dorsal to the ventral side . The dorsal portion is thick ; the segment thins out ventrally . Separating each myotome from its neighbor is a myoseptum , a band of connective tissue , uniting adjacent muscle // bands with each other and with the notochordal sheaths . The muscle fibers extend longitudinally , attached with connective tissues to the myosepta . Therefore when one side contracts , the animal forms the arc of a circle . As the anterior end of the animal is more rigid than the caudal end , the alternate contraction of the two sides sets up a propellerlike motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cyclostomes have more complex myotomes . The middle portion of the " V " is retained in place , the apex at the axial line , but the dorsal and ventral portions bent forward , giving a sigma shape to each myotome . Contractions thus tend to give a dorsoventral as well as a lateral motion . The myotomes of the dogfish are more complicated by the further bending and elongation of the dorsal part of the epaxial group . Each myotome is attached to several vertebrae so that in part the simple metameric structure is lost . The contraction of the myotome affects more than one segment of the body , and vertebral movements have greater flexibility . Evolution beyond this point , particularly in the land veil cbrates , is correlated with ( 1 ) the lack of a supporting water environment which diffuses shocks and ( 2 ) the flexibility required by land life where locomotion is supplied by the lags rather than by axial movements of the body . There is a progressive elongation and splitting of the myotomes so that they are // attached to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual function impossible in the simpler forms . The embryology of the mammal demonstrates many of these changes . The first myotomes are simple metameric structures broken at the axial line . The epaxial group elongate , split , and become largely longitudinal in position . A great number of muscles result , some remaining as short muscles of small diam- ( ter , others fusing to form long muscles that extend more than half the length of the vertebral column . These back muscles are classified into several distinct groups . In the anterior region are short occipital muscles which are attached to the head and cervical vertebrae . These are structurally continuous with the short vertebral muscles that attach to the spines of the vertebrae . Lateral to these in the anterior half of the body are the long muscles of the back , the longissimus dorsi , composed of a number of slips . In the posterior half of the back , in addition to the short spinal muscles , are two major groups : ( 1 ) the mzultif idus and ( 2 ) the sacrospinalis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transverse processes of the vertebrae and give leverage to the back ; this is , usually , the strongest muscle group of the body . // The caudal muscles are continuations of the axial muscles . In the reptiles the body decreases in size toward the tip of the tail without any definite break in continuity at the pelvis . I n the mammals the tail is less prominent and does not serve as a locomotor or balancing organ as in the reptiles ; as the tail degenerates these muscles become less and less prominent . A functional exception exists in the South American monkeys and other mammals with prehensile tails , for in these the caudal muscles are well developed to the tip ; but in these animals the tail is approximately the same size throughout its length and is clearly delimited from the body . In the higher anthropoids and man , iii which the tail is vestigial , the caudal muscles remain as a small // group of anal muscles , giving added support to the perineum in the upright walking position . Certain of the epaxial muscles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pass posteriorly to the pelvis and femur . This is the powerful iliopsoas group , whose homologue begins in the urodele amphibia . During the course of evolution the hypaxial region remains more primitive . The ventral elements of the myotome form the costal or rib muscles , which are distinctly metameric . In most vertebrates they are limited to the thoracic region of the body . In the abdominal region the hypaxial muscles form the layers of the body wall and the rectus abdominis . The abdominal muscles are in three layers : ( 1 ) an inner transverse group with the fibers running dorsoventrally , ( 2 ) the middle oblique fibers which are directed in an anteroventral direction , and ( 3 ) the external oblique fibers which pass from the epaxial line in a posteroventral direction . The fibers from either side meet a connectivetissue septum , the linea alba , in the midline . The rectus ab206 STRUCTURE OF THE VERTEBRATES dominis muscle is another part of the abdominal group . The fibers are longitudinal , arising on the pubic bones and extending anteriorly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The hypaxial caudal muscles , like those of the epaxial region , undergo degeneration ( luring their evolution and are left in man as a few small muscles in the anal region . D. BRANCHIOMERIC MUSCLES The muscles attached to the bronchial or visceral skeleton form the group known as the branchiomeric muscles . Although these muscles are striated and are functionally similar to the skeletal muscles , they are derived from the ventral portion of the myotome , the hypomere , and are more closely related developmentally to the visceral muscles than to the myotontac musculature . It will be recalled ( page 160 ) that in the embryo of the typical vertebrate there are seven gill or branchial arches . In the dogfish the first two of these developed into the jaws anti hyoid apparatus , while the posterior five remained as gill supports . The musculature of the branchial arches retains its original function as elevators or depressors of the gill cartilages and constrictors of the pharynx . The branchiomeric muscles of the first two arches are highly modified . The levator group of the first arch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Meckel 's cartilage ) , and in contracting they close the mouth . The ventral depressor group is incompletely fused wi the hyoid depressors . The dorsal elevators of the hyoid for a part of the jaw musculature , for the hyomandibular is a part of the jaw apparatus . In the urodele amphibia there is a further degeneration o the arches , and the posterior branchiomeric muscles are vest igi except as they function in the constriction and dilation of t pharynx . The muscles of the jaw and hyoid structures have fundamentally similar structure in the amphibia and reptil The hyomandibular has no connection with jaw support hut , an ossicle of the ear , and the anterior part of the relatively In muscle of the dogfish is a vestigial stapedial muscle . The levator muscles of the first arch are divided to form a deep tempo // and a superficial masseter . The larger part of the dorsal muscle of the second arch is shifted ventrally , with the insertion on the lower side of the jaw , and forms a part of the digastric muscle which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the posterior ( gill ) arches are small and attached to the hyoid and the cartilages of the larynx ; they also retain their function as pharyngeal constrictors . The mammal retains the relationships outlined above , although the distribution of the muscles varies . The muscles attaching the larynx to the sternum are long and slim . With the greater development of the laryngeal cartilages the muscles are more widely separated in origin and insertion , and in function t hey are apparently more independent of each other . One of the most prominent differences is the evolution of the platysma . In the primitive mammals this muscle is a thin sheet which spreads over the face and head , but if its evolution is traced in the primates , this primitive sheet becomes progressively divided to form the facial muscles which give changes of expression to the anthropoids and man . Because of its innervation the trapezius muscle , which covers the anterior part of the shoulder and inhells on the scapula , is frequently classified as a visceral muscle . However , as this muscle has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nerve XI , page 352 ) and as an apparently homologous muscle exists in the dogfish , the trapezius is treated with the myotomic muscles of the shoulder . The visceral or branchiomeric muscles are innervated by cranial nerves ( page 351 ) . The first arch in the dogfish is supplied by branches of the trigeminal ( Nerve V ) , the second by branches of the facial ( Nerve VII ) , and the third by the glossopharyngeal ( Nerve IX ) . The posterior four arches are supplied by t lie vagus ( Nerve X ) . With the division and changes of function which occur during the evolution of these muscles the innervations remain almost unchanged . The nerve-muscle relationships of this group will become clearer with a study of the ain and cranial nerves . // E. APPENDICULAR MUSCLES The origin of the appendicular muscles is intimately connected with the origin of the limbs . The entire appendage arises embryologically as two rows of metameric buds , one epaxial and one hypaxial , which grow distally from the mesodermal somites ( page 175 ) . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primitive classes of vertebrates . In the turtle the muscle buds are clearly defined , although there is some fusion of the separate cell masses . Lack of definition between the individual buds is progressive in the more specialized classes , and a telescoping of early stages of development is found , as in other organs and systems of the body . In the mammal each appendage arises as a mass of cells coming from several segments , and this apparently undifferentiated mass grows distally to form the limb . At this stage the limb bud is roughly triangular , with the base toward axial muscle segments . Spinal nerves from all the adjacent myotomes migrate into the limb , converge near the line where the limb grows out from the body , and eventually form the large plexus of nerves found in the armpit or axilla . The appendicular muscles begin in all vertebrates as dorsal and ventral groups , and no matter how much torsion or specialization of the limb takes place , this relationship is maintained . After the full development of the limb the muscles fall into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have their origin on the girdles or other bones and pass out to the limb where they insert , and ( 2 ) the intrinsic muscles , which lie entirely on the appendage . The latter , even including the muscles of the digits , retain the primitive dorsal and ventral relationships . 1 . Pectoral limb . The extrinsic muscles of the pectoral limb are most primitive in the fish . They are fan-shaped groups of fibers , the apex inserting on the basal cartilages . In the urodeles the dorsal group becomes divided into several distinct muscled which can be homologized with those of the mammal : ( a ) an anterior sheet , the trapezius , arising on the spines of the vertebrae ; ( b ) a larger more posterior muscle , the latissimus dorm ' , which draws the forelimb posteriorly and slightly dorsally ; ( e ) // the deltoid , which lies between the two former muscles and is an abductor of the arm ; and ( d ) one or two other dorsal muscles which are not clearly homologized . The ventral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of // evolution other muscles are added to the anterior group , anti the pectoralis muscle is divided into two or three parts . All the muscles change their shape and relative size , but their position and function are very constant throughout the different classes . The intrinsic muscles of the anterior limb undergo much greater specialization . In the dogfish these muscles arise on iii basal cartilages and pass out to the distal cartilages as a group of separate slips or bands . With the development of tetrapod limbs in the urodeles the muscles take a more definite shape with a division of function . The ventral bicepsg which flexes the forearm , is well developed and remains in the higher classes as a single muscle . The dorsal muscle group is a large undivided muscle in the lower forms . It becomes variously divided , flue larger median part becoming the triceps of the mammal . The forearm of the urodele has the extensor , flexor , and pronator muscles developed . The pronator muscle remains relatively unchanged . The first two groups , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hands and fingers . The opposability of the thumb , which was supposed to be limited to man , has been shown to be a gradual evolution within tie // primates and correlated with structural changes . In the lower primates the long adductors and abductors are tendinous slips from the extensor and flexor series . In the higher primates there is a progressive splitting off of the thumb muscles until in man there is complete independence of the thumb from the other digits . The short digital muscles are too complicated for an elementary discussion . 2 . Pelvic limb . The muscles of the pelvic appendage , like its skeleton , are usually more specialized in the land animals than those of the anterior limb . Even in the dogfish there are considerable differences in the musculature of the two paired appendages . The pectoral muscles are wider at their origins and , correlated with the movable scapulae , give more freedom of movement . The differences become more marked in the earliest amphibia , whose muscular attachments have been deciphered with considerable accuracy through the study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these animals the pelvic limbs have become specialized for propulsion . When the knee was drawn toward the anterior part of the body , the torsion placed the dorsal muscles of the thigh in an anterior position . With this change the origins of the pelvic extrinsic muscles became compressed into narrower limits . This is particularly true of man and the higher anthropoids , where a more or less upright walking position has been assumed . In the mammals the rectus femoris on the anterior of the thigh , the adductor magnus which lies laterally , and the large gluteus group which form the buttocks can be compared in position with the three dorsal muscles of the pectoral limb . In the lumbar region a large muscle mass migrates into a subskeletal position , with origins on the ventral side of the transverse processes of the vertebrae . This is a very constant group in all land vertebrates and is the iliopsoas group of the mammals . They insert on the femur near its head . The greater specialization of the pelvic muscles as compared with the pectoral is found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In most vertebrates the foot is held in a permanent position of dorsoflexion . Therefore the dorsal t extensor ) group increase the flexion of the foot against the plank , and conversely the ventral ( morphologically the flexor ) gastrocnemius and other calf muscles pull the foot into a straight // line with the limb . Reference should be made to the discussion of the evolution of the leg position . The calf muscles are usually much more powerful than the dorsal group . In the normal walking position of the vertebrate the push of the pelvic limb is gained by straightening the three angles ? those between body and thigh , thigh and shank , shank and foot . The last gives the final push forward , particularly when the animal is in rapid motion . F. INTEGUMENTARY MUSCLES The muscle slips which become attached to the skin arise from all three of the skeletal muscle groups . The integumentary muscles are of small importance when they occur in the reptiles , but they become quite prominent in most of the orders of mammals . A dog or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscles . In the armadillo , which is covered with dermal plates , these muscles are very large . During the evolution of the primates the integumentary muscles of the body region become of increasingly less importance , until in man they have all but disappeared . The panniculus carnosus is the major integumentary muscle o f the body and in most mammals is distributed over the entire ( ack and sides . The panniculus of the lemurs is large , enveloping the body . In the lower monkeys it becomes restricted to a hand on either side of the body , centering in the axillary and inguinal regions ; and in the anthropoids it is further reduced to small slips which spread out from the axilla to the skin . The appearance of the panniculus in man is only occasional , and it is then limited to thin bands in the axilla or to elongated slips along the sternum . The integumentary muscles of the neck and face , however , do not undergo the same degeneration . The alligator and some of her reptiles have a well-developed transverse band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is derived from the branchiomeric group . In the mammals this muscle divides to form two distinct groups : a neck muscle which retains the original name and a larger portion , the platysma , which spreads over the face and moves the skin , scalp , and ears . The mimetic muscles of the higher primates are derived from the platysma . These // become progressively differentiated in the anthropoids and man . In the latter the muscles attached to the ears and scalp have degenerated , and the ability to move either of these structures appears only as an anomaly . The derivatives of the platysma which control the eyes , lips , and facial expression , on the other hand , are more developed in man than in other mammals . As with other muscle functions , it is incorrect to say that frowning or smiling is limited to any one genus . The chimpanzee and gorilla have every facial expression known to man , although in many cases the facial co-ordinations are less well developed . CHAPTER VIII DIGESTIVE SYSTEM DuE to the fact that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the digestive tract , the two systems are frequently classified together as the digestive and respiratory system . Functionally , however , the two are widely different , and technically are separate systems . The intimate connection between them is most apparent in the more primitive classes . In Aniphioxus , the cyclostomes , and the fish the oxygen used in metabolism is dissolved in the water , and both food and oxygen enter through the mouth . The excess water passes out from the pharynx through the gill slits and the food is swallowed . Actually , a limited connection is maintained in all vertebrates , the passages of the digestive and respiratory tracts meeting in the pharynx . The digestive system includes the functions of food-getting , digestion , absorption , and defecation . The other nutritive processes include distribution of digested materials by the bloodvascular system , metabolism within the cells , and the excretion of waste products . Distribution and excretion are discussed in later chapters . The teeth , which function in securing and crushing food materials , were included with the skull , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the teeth should be reviewed , for there is a close correlation between tooth structure , the anatomy of the digestive tract , and the type of food taken by the animal . A. DEVELOPMENT The origin of the digestive tract begins with gastrulation , hen the archenteron ( primitive gut ) is formed . Around this endodermal tube the mesodermal smooth muscles and mesenteries 215 // are added . The digestive tract in its completed form consists of the endodermal lining ( the epithelium ) and the contracting and strengthening tissues . In Amphioxus the process of invagination during the development of the gastrula gives the archenteron a tubular shape , the original blastopore marking the point at which the anus will develop ; but in the frog , because of the slight degree of invagina- tion ( page 58 ) , the early archenteron is a wide slitlike structure curved both transversely and longitudinally . The early endodermal layer of the amniotes lies flat on the yolk sac , and the embryo assumes a cylindrical shape by a ventral bending of the margins of the embryonic disc . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving it a tubular form , ale though it remains wide open over the yolk sac . At this stage o development the primitive gut is closed at both anterior an posterior ends , the portion of the tube anterior to the yolk sac being the fore-gut and the posterior portion the hind-gut . The posterior end of the hind-gut , including the allantoic outpocketing , enlarges to form a cloaca . An inpocketing at 114 posterior end of the embryo breaks through to form the veil and an oral ( mouth ) pit develops at the anterior end . Thus // when the mouth and cloacal vent develop , both are lined partly with an ectodermal tissue . In the mouth this is of particular interest , for the dental vesicle which secretes the enamel of the teeth arises from ectodermal epithelium . The primitive tube becomes lengthened and modified into more or less sharply defined regions . In the lower vertebrates the mouth cavity , the pharynx , and the esophagus are practically continuous . There is more separation between the regions in the reptiles , particularly the alligators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mammals the three regions are clearly delimited . The stomach is developmentally a pouchlike enlargement of the digestive tube . In most vertebrates a constrictor muscle surrounds the posterior end of the esophagus , and except in the cyclostomes the outlet of the stomach is guarded by a strong pyloric sphincter . The intestine is the longest portion of the tube . In this region the digestion of foods is continued and the absorption of nutrient materials takes place . The intestine itself is divided into regions . The stomach contents empty into the small intestine . Its anterior portion is the short duodenum into which the liver and pancreatic ducts empty and is often classified as a separate part of the intestinal tract . In the higher vertebrates the small intestine joins a heavy-walled large intestine or colon which enters the rectum , an enlarged portion of the intestinal tract . In the fish , amphibia , reptiles , birds , and nionotremes the anus empties into the cloaca , an enlarged saclike structure receiving the products of the digestive and urinogenital tracts . In the higher mammals the cloaca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separately . The digestive glands develop as outpocketings from the gut . As in the case of other glands , these vary from single secretory cells to large compound glands supported by masses of connective tissue . Of the latter , the pancreas and liver are the most important . 1 . Pancreas . The pancreas develops as outpocketings , which May be single or multiple , from the duodenal region of the instine . As the original evaginations branch the resulting ducts come smaller , and the minute terminal ducts expand into asklike acini ( page 125 ) . The secretory cells are in the acini , nil the pancreatic juices are carried to the duodenum by the // ducts . In external appearance the gland may be compact , as in the dogfish , or diffuse , as in the mammal . Fundamentally the structure in both is much the same , the differences depending on the binding of the individual lobes and lobules by the connective tissues of the mesentery . For example , the mammalian pancreas has a definite form in situ but spreads out into isolated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its digestive functions , the pancreas contains minute " islands " of duct less . tissue which function as glands of internal secretion ( Chapter XIX ) . 2 . The liver is a ventral outgrowth almost opposite the pancreatic ducts . The homologous hepatic caecum of Amphioxus is similar in development but does not become highly glandular . The embryonic hepatic caecum of the vertebrates grows anteriorly , and the distal end divides to form a mass of tubular glands . The liver becomes attached to the diaphragm anterior to the stomach , but the large duct , which is the original outpocketing , empties into the duodenum . A comparison with Amphioxus will explain the relationships in the vertebrate . Although the liver does not secrete digestive enzymes , it is of major importance in the digestive process . The bile has a lubricating and emulsifying function and contains the waste products of red ? blood-cell destruction . In a number of vertebrates the bile flow ! into the intestine as it is secreted ; in others there is a storago sac , the gall bladder , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liver tends to be smaller in herbivorous animals than in carnivorous , and in many of the former the gall bladder is lacking . // The vascular connections of the liver are specialized in connection with its function as a storage gland for carbohydrates . Although this function is not demonstrated in Amphioxus , the vein draining the digestive tract ( the subintestinal ) passes to the liver and there breaks into capillaries ; the confluence of these vessels forms the more anterior hepatic vein which carries the blood toward the heart . The same relationship exists in all vertebrates . The hepatic portal vein breaks into capillaries in the liver , most of the sugars pass into the tissues of the gland , and the hepatic vein empties into other ( systemic ) veins before entering the heart . The spleen is a part of the vascular system . It is mentioned here because it will be identified in dissections and serves as a landmark in the anatomy of the mammalian digestive system . B. DEVELOPMENT OF MESODERMAL VISCERAL STRUCTURES The student should refer to the diagrams of the embryology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the digestive organs in the body and the origin of their muscular walls and mesenteries . Recall that as the hypomere of the rnesodermal somite grows distally from the notochord it divides into two layers : ( 1 ) the somatopleure , the outer or body layer , and ( 2 ) the inner visceral layer or splanchnopleure . The cavity between is the coelomic cavity . As the splanchnopleure pushes in toward the median line the archenteron is separated from the notochord and forced ventrally . The right and left sides of the splanchnopleure enclose the gut and thicken to form the heavy wall of smooth muscle with its peritoneal covering . Dorsally the layers join to form the thin strong mesentery which suspends the gut from the dorsal wall of the body cavity . The thin layer f mesodermal epithelium lining the coelomic cavity and covering the viscera is the peritoneum . It is evident that any outgrowth from the digestive tract will push the mesodermal tissues out with it and become surrounded by connective tissues and peritoneum . Therefore , although structures appear to lie in the coelomic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are usually suspended by long mesenteries ; the kidneys are rarely completely surrounded by // the peritoneum on the dorsal side ; and the urinary bladder may have but slight contact with the peritoneal lining . When the mesentery develops in the embryo it is connected ventrally as well as dorsally , but except for a few isolated regions the ventral portion is soon lost . The dorsal mesentery ( which may be called simply mesentery ) becomes very complex . The lengthening of the intestine stretches it along the ventral margin so that it becomes thrown into wide folds or ruffles , while the attachment along the dorsal median line remains only the length of the animal 's body . The growth of glands further cum- // plicates its structure . Each as it grows out pulls the mesentery with it so that the adult has numerous small supporting mesenteric folds . In the mammals a ventral pocket of the mesentery grows posteriorly from the stomach so that it forms an apron that covers the viscera . This is the fat-laden omentum . The heart of the vertebrate is developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the intestine . The median sides of the ventral mesoderm , the splanchnopleure , thicken and close around the paired veins . As the lungs grow posteriorly a band of figure mesenchymal tissue is separated from the spongy mass of the body wall on either side , and these bands become the pericardium . The coelom still communicates throughout but is divided anteriorly by the two longitudinal bands into a median pericardial cavity and the lateral pleural canals . In the cyclostomes , the elasmobranchs , and the chondrostean teleostomes the pleural canals are continuous with the abdominal coelom and the pericardial cavity opens posteriorly . The latter becomes closed posteriorly in other fish , but the pleural canals remain open in amphibia and most reptiles . In the mammals a transverse septum begins ventrally posterior to the heart and grows dorsally , separating the abdominal coelom from the paired pleural cavities . This septum is largely responsible for the development of the diaphragm . As a result of the development of this septum the original coelomic cavity is divided into three anterior ( thoracic ) cavities : the median @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each of the latter is called the pleura , which lines the cavity of one side and is reflected over the surface of the lung . // C. MODIFICATIONS OF THE DIGESTIVE TRACT The digestive tract as a whole has undergone so many modifications during the course of evolution that recent animals give slight evidence of its evolutionary history . The functions of the different regions of the tract remain very constant , but the structural variations are almost limitless . Within a family or order the specializations are usually not great , but there is little progressive evolution from class to class . There is an excellent , although not perfect , correlation between the food habits of the animal and the length and shape of the intestine . The herbivores have a complex stomach , a long intestine , and usually a large caccum . In the carnivores the stomach and intestine are simpler in structure , and the tract is decidedly shorter . In some cases wide variations may be found within an order . Fruit-eating bats ( order Chiroptera ) have longer intestines than carnivorous ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mammals is found in those bats that live on blood . Differences in intestinal length may exist even within a species ; the Eskimo , for example , has a shorter intestine than the white man . There are many exceptions to the general rule of correlation between length and structure of the digestive tract and diet . Further , the length of the esophagus is correlated with the length of the neck rather than with the type of food ; and the structure of the parts is definitely a part of the heredity of the organism . On the other hand , the length of the intestine , particularly the large intestine ( colon ) , is influenced in its development by the diet . A tadpole fed on algae has a longer intestine than one fed on insect larvae , and the proportion between colon and small intestine of the rat varies with a herbivorous or heavy protein diet . It is probable that the intestinal differences in man are developmental rather than differences in genetic constitution . 1 . MouTH AND PHARYNX . In the fish and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the latter it the larger of the two . With the disappearance of the gill slits in the adult , which occurs in the more specialized amphibia // and all the amniotes , the pharynx tends to be relatively smaller ; in the higher amniotes it is separated from the mouth by a fold of tissue . In the mammals this is the soft palate . The mouth is distinguished by the jaws with teeth . In the fish the skin covering the jaws forms the anterior margin of the mouth , but in the amphibia lips develop as folds of tissue anterior to the gums of the jaws . The lips and cheeks are well developed in most reptiles , with the exception of the Chelonia , and they are highly specialized in the mammals . The birds lost the lips with the loss of teeth and the development of the beak . // The tongue , a ventral muscular organ , is found in most fish as a flat thickening above the hyoid apparatus . In the higher classes of vertebrates it becomes more specialized as to size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached at the anterior margin and can be turned outward as a trap for insects , and the forked tongue of many reptiles are well-known specializations . Particularly in the mammal , the tongue assists in swallowing and contains most of the taste buds . The glands of the mouth are limited to simple mucous cells in the fish . More complex glands appear in the land vertebrates and have the double function of moistening the lips , mouth , and food , thus assisting in getting and swallowing food ; and of secreting various enzymes . The glands are classified by their position as ( 1 ) labial , ( 2 ) buccal , ( 3 ) lingual ( tongue ) or sublingual , ( 4 ) mandibular , or ( 5 ) submaxillary . The secretion varies widely in composition . The salivary secretion of the mammals is either serous or mucous . The poison of reptiles is a secretion from specialized mouth glands , and so is the gelatinous material used in the building of many birds ' nests . The gill slits are located in the pharynx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land vertebrates the posterior slits disappear ; the most anterior remains as the Eustachian tube and middle ear . This opens into the pharynx . In mammals and some reptiles the pharynx is the common cavity for swallowing and breathing . The nasal cavities have been cut off from the mouth and enter the pharynx . The opening to the lungs is at the posterior end of the pharynx , and the mechanism that controls breathing and swallowing is located in this region . 2 . ESOPHAGUS AND STOMACH . The esophagus is a straight tube leading from the pharynx to the stomach . Its length varies with neck length rather than any functional adaptation . The diameter tends to be larger in animals which swallow their food whole , such as the reptiles and carnivorous mammals . The sphincter which separates the esophagus from the stomach is poorly developed in amphibia and reptiles , so that regurgitation of food is a simple matter ; but in mammals the opening is small // and the constrictor muscles are more completely under the control of the nervous system . The esophagus is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and function . Many birds lack the capacity for forcing food down the esophagus but raise their heads higher than the stomach when swallowing ; most mammals , however , are capable of swallowing water when the esophagus is pointed vertically downward . The epithelial lining of the tube may be ciliated , as in the frog and the early embryo of man ; the lining may be covered with horny papillae , as in some turtles ; or the tube may be smooth or corrugated by longitudinal folds . The esophagus is more highly specialized in the birds than any other class of vertebrates . Just anterior to the sternum there is an enlarged pouch , the crop , in which food is stored . In many birds it is glandular and begins the digestive process , partly by softening the food and partly by breaking the grain with enzymes . The stomach breaks the larger masses of food and begins the digestion of proteins . The acids and digestive enzymes destroy the connective tissues which bind together the cells of muscles and hasten gastric and intestinal digestion . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscular and churn the mass until it is mixed with the digestive fluids . Anatomically , the simplest stomach is a slight enlargement , and in the cyclostomes it is continuous with the intestine . This stomach-intestine is sufficient to digest the finely ground particles of flesh which are swallowed . In the vertebrates generally the carnivorous ones have a simpler stomach than those with herbivorous habits , but this is subject to so many variations that the structure of the stomach can not be regarded as a fundamental characteristic . The amphibia have a rather simple type of stomach with the typical double layer of smooth muscle , one circular and the other longitudinal . The glands near the esophagus differ in structure from those near the posterior ' ( pyloric ) end , although the same gland cells appear to secrete both the enzyme pepsin and hydrochloric acid , the functions not being separate as in the mammals . The stomach of the reptiles , with a few exceptions , is sim226 STRUCTURE OF THE VERTEBRATES pie . Among the turtles ( order Chelonia ) the only exception to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turtle ( Sphargis ) . In the snakes and lizards the stomach is practically continuous with the esophagus ; but herbivorous lizards have a stomach which is larger and more constricted than that of the carnivorous forms . The crocodiles and alligators have diverged widely from the typical . In them the stomach is small when compared with the size of the animal and the enormous amounts of food frequently taken at one time , but the food may be stored in the distensible gullet . The stomach consists of a very muscular fundic region , the gizzard , and a thin-walled pyloric region . The stomach is highly glandular , and digestion is rapid . The birds have a stomach which also consists of a thin-walled portion and a gizzard , but the position of the two parts is re ? versed from that of the alligator . The anterior fundic portion is the secreting organ , and it is almost continuous with the esophagus . Posterior to the glandular portion is the highly muscular gizzard which grinds the food after it is moistened with digestive // fluids . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assist in the grinding process . The mammals have only a few characteristics that can be regarded as general . There are three types of secreting glands , and the sphincter muscles at the entrance of the esophagus ( cardiac sphincter ) and at the union with the duodenum ( pyloric sphincter ) are usually well developed . In the rodents and primates the stomach is relatively uncomplicated , with a slight constriction separating the cardiac from the pyloric region . The most complicated stomach structure is found in the cud-chewing herbivores ( order Artiodactyla ) , in which it is divided into four distinct regions . When the food is swallowed it falls into the large paunch or reservoir . Such animals tend toward periods of active food-getting and periods of rest when the ingested material is chewed . The softened food passes into the second , smaller reservoir and is regurgitated and chewed . When the food is swallowed a second time , muscular contractions force it into the glandular anterior chamber , and eventually it passes into the pyloric chamber . The mechanism is correlated with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy cellulose walls , must be broken down to release the contained food materials . 3 . INTESTINE . The cyclostomes have a straight intestinal tube not divided into anatomical regions . The dogfish intestine consists of a short duodenum , a greatly enlarged spiral valve , and a short rectal region . The valve arises as a spiral infolding of the gut wall , strongly supported by connective tissues and covered with the digestive and absorbing epithelium . The structure gives a greatly increased functional surface . The spiral valve was carried over in modified form to the more primitive bony fish , including the Crossopterygii and a few of the Teleostei . In other teleosts there are blind outpocketings or caeca which increase the digestive area . The absorbing surface of the amphibia is increased by a narrowing of the lumen of the tube and by great increase in length of the coiled intestine . In the turtle the small intestine is separable into two parts , the duodenum and the ileum . At the colon there is a swelling , a rudimentary caecum , and the short large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reptiles there is a very slight difference between the ileum and the colon , but there is a constriction which is probably homologous with the ileocolic valve of the mammals . The mammalian intestine is more clearly differentiated into regions than those of other vertebrates , and it was from human anatomy that the term " small intestine " arose . The small intestine is divided into the duodenum , into which the pancreatic and liver ducts empty , as in other vertebrates , and the jejunum and ileum , which are separated on the basis of their histological and glandular structure . The absorptive area is increased by an enormous number of projections or villi on which are located the secretory cells . There are two bands of smooth muscle ; the outer of these is the longitudinal layer . Muscular contractions pass down the intestines as a peristaltic motion . At the junction with the colon the ileum has a strong sphincter , the ileocolic valve . With few exceptions the small intestine enters the colon at right angles , some distance from the blind end . This extension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caecum . In herbivorous mammals the caecum is large and a functional part of the digestive tract , for its bacterial // content assists in breaking down the cellulose walls of plant cells . In goats and some others the cellulose , after being fragmented by bacteria , is further digested and absorbed in the colon . The caecum of man is short and terminated by a small , slightly coiled appendage , the vermiform appendix . The evidence from embryology and the comparative anatomy of the primates indicates that the appendix is the vestigial remains of a once large caecum . The rectum is the enlarged terminal portion of the intestine and is a reservoir for the feces . The rectum terminates at the tutus , which is closed by the sphincter ani . // 4 . CLOACA . The cloaca develops from the enlarged part of the hind-gut from which the allantois outpockets , and it is partly lined by inpocketed ectoderm . With a few exceptions ( as in snow cyclostomes and fish ) a cloaca is present in all vertebrate groups except the marsupials and placentals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the embryo until a horizontal septum cuts the dorsal from the ventral part and separates the anus from the urinogenital openings . ( See Figs. 124 and 180 and discussion on page 299 . ) D. THE HUMAN DIGESTIVE TRACT The mouth cavity and esophagus of man are typically mammalian . The stomach is a simple sac slightly divided into two regions : the cardiac or larger portion and the pyloric region which lies toward the right side and empties into the duodenm . The small intestine averages about twenty-two feet in lengt Ii , // although variations ranging from sixteen to thirty-one feet have been noted . It is divided into the duodenum , about a foot long ; the jejunum , the anterior two-fifths of the remainder ; and the ileum , the posterior three-fifths . The small intestine enters the colon at the ileocolic valve . The colon is nearly five feet in length , with the ileocolic valve which constricts the entrance of the ileum about three inches from its blind end . The vermiform appendix averages a few inches in length . Its lumen , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At times the point of division between appendix and caecum is hardly determinable . The juncture of the ileum and colon and the position of the appendix is normally in the lower right side . From this point the colon passes anteriorly as the ascending colon ; bends and lies across the body as the transverse colon ; and on the left side near the spleen it bends posteriorly at the splenic flexure , and passes posteriorly as the descending colon . In the posterior part of the body cavity the colon makes a curved turn , the sigmoid flexure , and then enters the rectum . The latter is slightly less than six inches in length . CHAPTER XIV RESPIRATORY SYSTEM RESPIRATION is the process of taking in oxygen for metabolic processes and giving off the excess carbon dioxide from the blood . In all vertebrates respiration is divided into ( 1 ) external respiration , the mechanism for getting oxygen from the surrounding medium , and ( 2 ) internal respiration , the passage of oxygen from the blood across the membrane of each cell of the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which take the oxygen from the animal 's environment . Any moist vascular membrane may serve as an organ of respiration . In the vertebrates there are a number of such respiratory membranes in isolated groups , but the most widely distributed organs are gills in the water-dwelling groups and lungs in the land vertebrates . Some amphibia , however , lack both lungs and gills , and other groups have various organs modified for respiration . Gills are the most primitive respiratory organs of vertebrates . A. GILLS 1 . ORIGIN OF the GILL SLITS . An outline of the development of gill slits was given on page 28 . The embryonic pharynx is relatively much larger than that of the adult , and the difference is much more marked in the higher groups of vertebrates . In Amphioxus there is a great number of the endodermal pharyngeal pockets , each of which becomes secondarily divided into two . In the cyclostomes the number is reduced to fourteen for the primitive group and seven for the lampreys . The latter number of gill slits was carried over to the primitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are found . In the dogfish the number is reduced to the definitive vertebrate number , five , with the first anterior pouch forming the spiracle . This structure in t ho dogfish carries a rudimentary gill on its posterior surface . In // most of the higher fish the spiracle is completely lost , although it is retained by the crossopterygian fish , and from them inherited by the amphibia as the Eustachian tube and middle ear . The embryos of all vertebrates develop the gill pouches , and with certain doubtful exceptions these break through to the outside of the animal as gill slits . Gills develop only in the cyclo- stomes , fish , and amphibia and are never found in amniote embryos . The septum between each two gill pouches is supported by a gill bar or branchial cartilage . These branchial cartilages become variously modified in the vertebrates . ( See discussion of the visceral skeleton , page 160 . ) A horizontal section through the human embryonic pharynx illustrates the typical vertebrate condition . The five paired branchial evaginations extend laterally from the pharynx . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functional , but from each pouch develops a proliferation of cells which becomes differentiated into a glandular structure . These glands , // which will be discussed in Chapter XIX , are ductless and function as glands of internal secretion . The derivatives of the gill pouches are : I , the paired Eustachian tubes ; II , the palatine tonsils , which retain their position in the pharynx throughout life ; III , the thymus gland , the two halves of which unite and migrate posteriorly , with the adult gland located near the bifurcation of the trachea ; A Ventral View B.

The development of the middle car and Eustachian tube from the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The pharyngeal glands are derivatives of the pouches , not modifications of the structures themselves . 2 . INTERNAL GILLS . Internal gills develop within the gill slits of the early chordates , the fish , and the larvae of most amphibia . In several amphibian groups they are carried over to the adult . These internal gills may be covered entirely by endoderm or by both endoderm and ectoderm. // In Amphioxus , it will be recalled , the afferent branchials break into capillaries in the gills , and as the blood-stream slows down the exchange of gases takes place . The capillaries then collect again into efferent branchials which pass into the dorsal aortae . This is essentially the same condition which prevails throughout the gill-breathing fish and amphibia . In the amniotes the relationships of the branchial arteries are the same , although they do not break into capillaries . In the dogfish the gill is a paired structure , developing along the inner surface of the gill bar . The two halves or hemibranchs of each gill lie in adjacent gill slits . Therefore the gills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cartilages ; one half belongs to the anterior bar , the other half to the next posterior gill support . This relationship of the hemibranchs is carried over to iho higher groups . The greatest change that occurs in the more specialized fish is the modification of the septa separating the gills from each other . The septa of the dogfish extend from the pharynx to the outside of the animal , and the septum is covered externally by the body skin . Each gill slit , in other words , is a simple opening through the body wall , connecting the pharynx with the exterior . In the Chondrostei ( page 43 ) a bony covering , the operculum , shields the gill slits . In this group there is a degeneration of the distal part of the septum , so that , t ho // body covering of skin is no longer present in the region . The reduction of the septa proceeds further in the Holostei , and in the Teleostei the septa are reduced to a small fleshy membrane along the gill bar . This modification obscures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It gives , however , greater function to the gills ; for they are protected by the operculum , and the gill filaments are in freer contact with the water . 3 . EXTERNAL GILLS . External gills make their first appearance in the crossopterygian and dipnoan fish . In the larvae of these animals the gills develop on the outer side of the branchial septa . Their position is shown in the drawing on page 000 . As the internal gills develop both types of gill are present for a time and then the external disappear . Almost the same condition is found in the amphibia , in which the external gills are wholly ectodermal and appear before the gill pouches break through . They are very prominent structures in the early larvae . In urodeles with persistent gills both sets remain , but in the salamanders and anurans the external gills disappear when the internal gills and operculum develop . The operculum is a fleshy membrane not homologous with that of the fish . At metamorphosis the lungs replace the gills . Exceptions to this rule , due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vascular supply of the external gills comes from the branchial arches by branches which pass out into the gills . With the disappearance of the gills the blood follows the more primitive course , circling through the gill support from the ventral to the dorsal aorta . The branchial arteries vary considerably in the different groups of amphibia , in correlation with the reduction in number of gills and the branchial arches . The second and fifth branchial pouches are rarely functional in amphibia . B. LUNGS Lungs are the functional respiratory organs of land animals . Their internal position keeps the epithelium moist . Like the gill slits they are a derivative of the digestive tract . In the fish , owever , the connection between the two systems is closer . Water , ie environmental medium , is drawn into the mouth with the // food ; and the dissolved oxygen of the water is taken up as it passes over the gills in its course to the outside . With the development of lungs a certain degree of separation begins between the digestive and respiratory tracts , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the respiratory tissues . 1 . EVOLUTION OF THE LUNGS . The first homologue of the lungs appears in the chondrostean fishes . In the sturgeon ( page 43 ) a dorsal outpocketing of the gut develops in the region between the pharynx and the esophagus . The distal portion of the diverticulum enlarges to form a swim-bladder , the duct of which maintains free connection with the gut throughout life . The organ is slightly vascular , the supply coming from the sixth branchial artery . In Amia ( a holostean fish ) the swim-bladder is highly vascular and the connection with the gut remains in the adult . From the simple slightly vascular condition , the swimbladder evolved in two directions : ( 1 ) toward the condition found in the teleost fishes , where the organ is nonvascular , loses its connection with the gut , and remains as a dorsal sac solely hydrostatic in function , and ( 2 ) toward a ventral position , the duct open and the function respiratory . The latter condition is found in the Crossopterygii and Dipnoi , which have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) has a swim-bladder which develops as a ventral outpocketing of the gut . The structure becomes bilobed and highly vascular , the blood supply coming from the sixth branchial as in the other fish . During dry periods or when the river waters become muddy the fish gulps air and carries on respiration with the bladder . The Dipnoi ( page 48 ) parallel the amphibia in development and have a swim-bladder which is functionally a lung . In the South American genus the structure is so specialized that the animal is unable to survive if kept submerged in water . When the amphibia evolved , the lung relationships of the crossopterygian ancestors were retained . The lung develops as a ventral outpocketing of the gut at the posterior end of the pharynx and soon divides into two distinct lobes . The opening from the pharynx is the larynx ; the undivided upper portion of the tube is the trachea ; and the two tubes into which the // trachea divides are the bronchi . Urodele lungs are simple expansions of each bronchus and are less lobulated than those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all amphibia have the gill and lung combination for respiration , and this double system is retained by many urodeles. // The homology of the swim-bladder is shown by ( 1 ) the comparative anatomy and function of the two structures ; ( 2 ) the mode of embryological development , which is practically identical in the crossopterygian and dipnoan fish and the land vertebrates ; and ( 3 ) the vascular supply . In all cases the supply is from the sixth aortic artery . It is only in the mammals and birds that there is a complete separation of the pulmonary arteries , which arise as branches of the sixth branchial , and the ventral aorta. 2 . COMPARATIVE ANATOMY OF THE LUNGS . Beginning with the unlobulated elongated lungs of the primitive urodeles , the lungs evolved toward more complex divisions . Salamanders have the anterior part of the lungs divided into shallow pockets or alveoli , giving the lungs a honeycomb appearance . Each alveolus opens wide into the central cavity , but the low septa add to the absorptive area of the epithelium . Frogs show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more rounded , in correlation with their body shape , and the alveoli are deeper and cover the entire inner surface of the lungs . The toads , which live in drier areas , have lungs of the frog pattern ; but the dividing septa close partly over the alveoli so that they give them an almost spherical shape with a circular opening into the central lung cavity . Sphenodon ( a primitive New Zealand reptile ) and some turtles have lungs which are no better developed than those of 4 frog . A definite advance in lung structure appears in the lizards , During development the alveoli move further from the centr cavity and are connected with it by small ducts homologo with the bronchioles of the birds and mammals . Alligators and crocodiles have the best-developed inn among the reptiles . As the lungs develop , each bronchus divid into several branches , thus cutting the lung into several lobe each with its own cavity . From the air cavity of each lobe nuttier ous bronchioles are given off , each ending in a spherical alveolus A progressive degeneration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the primitive condition the lungs are bilaterally symmetrical , but in the elongated lizards one lung is definitel // smaller than the other , and in the snakes one is either vestigial or lacking . Although the lungs of flying birds are not so greatly lobulated as those of the mammals , their lungs are specialized for greater efficiency . The organ is not of unusual size , but efficiency in gas exchange is increased by three pairs of air sacs . These sacs are continuations of bronchial ducts which expand after passing through the lungs to form membranous sacs in the pleural , abominal , and wing regions . As the air is drawn into the lungs t. passes across the alveoli and into the sacs and decreases the specific gravity of the animal . The ramifications of the sacs into the humeri can be demonstrated by cutting the humerus of pigeon and blowing smoke into the trachea . In addition to lightening the animal , the mechanism tends to lessen the total mount of air left in the lungs . Therefore the air , which is normally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // across the vascular ducts at inspiration and expiration as it is forced into and from the air sacs . Mammals have complexly lobulated lungs with innumerable : bronchioles and terminal alveoli . The structures have evolved so far that there is no sign of a central air cavity in any of the lobes . The idea of structure can best be gained by a description of the development of mammalian lungs . The human lungs begin in embryos of about 3.5 millimeters as a ventral groove along the esophagus . The posterior portion of the groove soon becomes separated from the floor of the gut and forms a blind tube opening into the pharynx . This opening is retained as the glottis . The posterior end divides into two lobes ; the distal ends become vesicular . At this stage there are a trachea and two bronchi . The latter continue to divide , the early divisions forming the larger lobes of the lung . The bronchi continue to divide into smaller and smaller tubes until microscopic bronchioles are formed . Each bronchiole terminates in a spheroidal alveolus . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Capillaries from the pulmonary arteries ramify around the smaller tubes . 3 . MECHANISM OF BREATHING . Most amphibian tadpoles take the air into the mouth and force it into the trachea by compressing the mouth and raising the tongue . This method is only slightly modified in the primitive lung-breathing urodeles , but in the frogs the air is drawn into the mouth cavity through the nares which open immediately behind the teeth and is forced through the glottis by movements of the floor of the mouth . Rep- // tiles , with the exception of the Chelonia and Crocodilia , depend almost entirely on the ribs as the respiratory mechanism . The contraction of the costal muscles forces the air from the lungs , and as the muscles relax the glottis opens and atmospheric pressure fills the lungs again . The crocodiles and alligators develop a muscular diaphragm which separates the pleural cavities from the abdominal cavity and aids in respiration . The diaphragm is highly developed in the mammals . It is a dome-shaped band of muscle with the convex side toward the pleural cavities . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inward , the diaphragm relaxes and the air is forced from the lungs . The reverse process greatly increases the ize of the chest , and air rushes in when the glottis is opened . n man , at least , diaphragmatic breathing has largely replaced ostal breathing . // 4 . DEVELOPMENT OF THE TRACHEA AND LARYNX . With the exception of the frogs and toads , in which the trachea is so short that the bifurcation into bronchi occurs almost at the glottis , and a few genera of salamanders which do not develop lungs , the larynx and trachea are well-developed structures in the tetrapods . During evolution the supporting cartilages of the trachea have been correlated with the development of the larynx . The tracheal and laryngeal cartilages differ in origin ; the former have no homologue in the fish , while the latter are modified visceral ( branchial ) cartilages of the embryo . The tracheal cartilages of the amphibia are varied in structure ; in the primitive condition it appears that there are more or less complete rings , particularly at the anterior end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some toads the cartilago supports infiltrate the lungs . The tracheal cartilages of the reptiles may be complete , or incomplete as in the alligator , but even when these rings are incomplete dorsally they usually are complete near the point of bifurcation and in the bronchi . With few exceptions the tracheal cartilages of the mammal are dorsally incomplete from the larynx to a point near the bronchi but form complete rings as they pass to the bronchi . As the two main bronchi reach the lungs the rings disappear and are replaced by irregularly shaped plates which surround each of the smaller bronchi . In man the cartilages disappear when the bronchial tubes reach a diameter of about one millimeter. // The larynx . It will be recalled that the first and second visceral arches form the jaws and hyoid apparatus in all vertebrates above the cyclostomes while the posterior ( branchial ) cartilages support the gills . In the dipnoan and crossopterygian fish , where the swim-bladder is modified into a respiratory organ , the opening of the trachea is unsupported ; but with the reduction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amphibia the larynx begins its development . The seventh visceral ( fifth bronchial ) cartilages are the first to become modified . These form the arytenoid cartilages on either side of the glottis . The next advance is in the reptiles . The arytenoids are of increased size , and the sixth visceral arches form an epiglottis. the paired cartilages migrate toward the ventral side of the glottis and unite to form the epiglottis , which curves over the opening of the glottis . In addition the third visceral ( first branchial ) cartilages fuse with the hyoid bone to form the renter horns of the hyoid and bring the structure into close contact with the larynx . Another modification is the fusion of le anterior rings of the trachea to form a supporting cricoid cartliage of the larynx . In the mammals the remaining cartilages of the branchial // skeleton are brought into the larynx . The second and third ( fourth and fifth visceral ) cartilages unite across the ventral side of the larynx to form the thyroid cartilage . In the monotremes this cartilage is clearly separated into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embryos of the higher mammals , but in these groups a complete fusion takes place during development . The homologies of the first two visceral arches were given in the section on the visceral skeleton but are included here for clarity . The jaws and cartilaginous supports for the gills assumed their definitive condition in the clasmobranch fishes . Therefore the posterior five visceral cartilages are called the branchial cartilages , and Visceral III is the same as Branchial I. Vocal cords are found first in the anuran amphibia . The . are membranous bands of tissue attached to the arytenoid car tilages and partially closing the glottis on either side . The eon // traction or relaxation of these membranes by movements of the larynx gives a limited change in pitch to the voice . This primitive voice mechanism is only slightly changed in the reptiles . In the mammals , however , with the development of the thyroid cartilages , the vocal cords stretch from the arytenoids to the thyroid cartilages . This increased length , correlated with the greatly developed muscular and nervous control of the larynx , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The principle of voice is based on the fact that a taut membrane vibrates more rapidly and with a higher pitch than one less tightly stretched . Differences in normal voice pitch in the mammals are due to the length of the membranes . Under equal tension a long cord will vibrate more slowly than a short one . The deeper voice of the male is caused by the growth of the larynx in a dorsoventral direction at puberty . Length of larynx and depth of voice in a species are definitely correlated with the prominence of the Adam 's apple . The voice box of the birds is an entirely different structure , located at the bifurcation of the trachea . This syrinx is a remarkably efficient organ as is demonstrated by parrots , mockingbirds , and other birds which have ability for mimicry and a wide variation in pitch . C. OTHER RESPIRATORY STRUCTURES In addition to gills and lungs , a number of animals have modifications of other structures with a respiratory function . The only one of wide distribution is the skin which serves as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waterdwelling urodeles the cutaneous artery along the side of the body is larger than the pulmonary artery . Even the frog secures much of its oxygen through the skin . The most highly developed case of skin-breathing is in some salamanders which lack both gills and lungs in the adult condition and carry on their entire respiration through the skin . Cutaneous breathing is necessarily limited to those animals which have a very thin , highly vascular skin and live in wet regions . For these reasons it is not found in any group above the amphibia . An isolated but interesting modification is found in the South // American dipnoans . The pelvic appendages of the male become vascular and swollen during the breeding season and the animals are able to stay submerged for long periods while guarding the egg masses . The sea turtle , although a lung-breathing amniote , has two specializations which aid in respiration . Both the pharynx and cloaca are vascular and have thin epithelial coverings , and by keeping a constant stream of water passing into and out of these openings the animals can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small amount of oxygen is needed , for the turtle at rest has a low metabolic rate , and a minimum of respiratory function suffices . There are no accessory respiratory structures in the birds and mammals , both of which have a heavy dead skin . This is also true of the completely aquatic forms . Porpoises and whales come to the surface frequently for air . Some of the latter have a pharyngeal air chamber which gives a reserve supply to the animal while under water , but respiration takes place in the lungs . CHAPTER XV VASCULAR SYSTEM THE blood-vascular system is the distributing mechanism of the body . Food materials are absorbed by the epithelium of the digestive tract ; oxygen is diffused through the lining of the lungs ; and these pass into the blood . In the more complex animals the means of distribution are very important , for substances necessary for metabolism can not be absorbed directly by the individual cells of the organism . Therefore an efficient system of distribution has been vital in the evolution of the higher groups . The chordates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epithelial lining of the vessels is continuous . The arteries divide to form capillaries , and the arterial capillaries become venous capillaries without any break . The blood , therefore , courses through unbroken channels . A certain amount of the vascular fluids seep through the capillary walls and surround the cells . These fluids are collected by the lymph vessels page 284 ) which empty into and have a lining continuous with that of the veins . The typical chordate system is found in Amphioxus . The ventral pulsating artery ( ventral aorta ) functions as a heart and forces the blood forward along the ventral vessel lying under the pharynx . Paired branchial arteries , the afferent vessels , pass from the aorta to the gills on either side , where each breaks into capillaries . The capillaries from each gill collect to form an efferent branchial artery , and these in turn form two dorsal aortae , one on either side of the notochord . At the posterior end of the pharynx these fuse to form a single median aorta lying ventral to the notochord . Arteries given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and oxygen , take up the waste products of metabolism , and collect food materials from the intestine . Veins are formed from the capillaries , and in Amphioxus 249 // there are two venous systems : ( 1 ) the subintestinal vein , which is homologous with the lateral body veins and the veins entering the liver ( hepatic portal ) of the higher vertebrates , and ( 2 ) the cardinal veins , a small group of vessels which drain the gonads and nephridia . The cardinal veins enter the subintestinal vessel anterior to its passage around and through the hepatic caecuin . The combined vessel is continuous with the pulsating portion of the ventral aorta and completes the vascular system of the animal . ( See the diagram of the blood system on page 20 . ) A. VASCULAR SYSTEM OF THE DOGFISH The heart of the dogfish is a muscular organ consisting of four distinct regions arranged in a series , lying along the anteroposterior axis of the body . The heart is enclosed in a pericardial sac , a division of the primitive coelomic cavity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleural cavities . Only Ile two middle parts of the heart are homologous with the chambers of the heart in the higher classes of vertebrates ; so the heart of the fish is usually considered as consisting of only t wo chambers , an atrium or auricle and one ventricle . The muscular // cavity anterior to the ventricle is the conus arteriosus , an enlargement of the aorta . The large thin-walled chamber posterior to the atrium is the sinus venosus , developed as a fusion of the veins leading into the heart . Venous blood enters the sinus venosus and passes directly into the atrium and then to the thickwalled ventricle . The ventral aorta extends anteriorly from the ventricle to the level of the first ( most anterior ) gill opening . Along its course the paired efferent branchial arteries are given off to the gill arches . There are six pairs in the embryo , but these are variously modified during development . Beginning posteriorly , the fifth and sixth are fused for a short distance from their point of origin , although they may be separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the third branchial arch , retains its primitive condition . The second and third unite to form the most anterior branch which leaves the dorsal aorta of the dogfish ( Fig. 157 ) . The first embryonic arch is incomplete in the elasmobranchs . The carotid arteries , which supply the head region , arise as branches from the dorsal part of the first arch mid as branches or extensions from the ventral aorta at its anterior bifurcation . After the afferent branchials break into capillaries in the gills they collect again as efferent branchial arteries ; or , develo STRUCTURE OF THE VERTEBRATES mentally , a continuous branchial artery breaks into capillaries in the gill , thus forming afferent and efferent vessels . The four pairs of efferent branchials of Squalus form complete loops around each gill pouch and then enter the dorsal aortae . The dorsal aorta arises as paired vessels which unite near the posterior limit of the pharynx . Two pairs of carotid arteries arise from the first arch , the internal carotid , supplying the brain , and the external carotid , which supplies the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches pass from the aortae to the mouth and esophagus ; and posterior to these the large subclavians go to the pectoral fins . The hypobranchial arteries supply the muscles of the gills , and from them the coronary arteries pass to the heart and pericardium . The body muscles are supplied by the small metameric parietal arteries . The larger branches of the dorsal aorta , in order from anterior to posterior , are : ( 1 ) coeliac , which divides into several branches and goes to the liver , stomach , duodenum , pancreas , and parts of the ileum ; ( 2 ) the anterior mesenteric artery , // to the left side of the intestine ; ( 3 ) the gastrosplenic , to the spleen and parts of the pancreas and stomach ; ( 4 ) the posterior mesenteric , supplying the rectal gland , rectum , and cloaca ; ( 5 ) the paired renal arteries , to the primitive kidneys ; and ( 6 ) the iliac arteries , which supply the pelvic fins . The dorsal aorta is continued into the tail as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arise directly from the dorsal aorta . Blood is returned to the heart through the veins , which will be traced from points of origin to the heart . Blood in the ventral and lateral muscles of the body is collected by the paired lateral veins and a single cutaneous vein . These empty directly into the heart . The lateral veins are joined by the subclavian and iliac veins from the appendages . The head region is drained by the anterior cardinals and the jugular veins . These may unite before entering the heart or enter separately . The caudal vein drains the tail region and at the level of the cloaca splits into two vessels which enter the kidneys and there break into capillaries . These two vessels are the renal portal veins . Observe that the blood passing to the excretory organs is both arterial and venous in origin ; the former supplies the tissues with food substances and oxygen and carries nitrogenous wastes to the organs of excretion . The capillaries from both veins and arteries unite to form a number of small veins along the median @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paired posterior cardinal vessels which pass anteriorly , close to the dorsal median line , to empty into the heart . The digestive tract and mesenteries are drained by the hepatic portal system . Food materials are taken from the absorptive cells of the intestine and carried to the liver . There the hepatic portal vein breaks into capillaries , and the sugars are to a large extent deposited as glycogen . The capillaries in the liver are collected into several vessels which unite to form the hepatic veins which enter the heart . The large vessels carrying blood to the heart are classified as two groups : ( 1 ) the systemic veins , which enter the heart directly , and ( 2 ) the portal veins , which break into capillaries before entering the heart . In the lower groups of vertebrates the veins do not enter the atrium but go into a sinus venosus , the thin-walled posterior chamber . The sinus is extended laterally in // the elasmobranchs as the ducts of Cuvier . The sinus venosus is present in the embryos of all vertebrate classes but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely in the birds and mammals . B. EMBRYONIC CIRCULATION OF THE AMNIOTES The embryonic development of the vascular system closely parallels the phylogenetic history . Therefore the embryonic circulation of the higher groups gives a generalized idea of the adult circulation of the lower forms . The following discussion is based upon the embryology of the chick , which is essentially like that of the other amniotes , although the placentals have numerous minor modifications in correlation with placental nutrition . The student will recall that the reptile , bird , and monotreme embryos develop on large-yolked eggs with meroblastic cleavage , but that the marsupials and placentals have small ova which cleave holoblastically . The latter develop a yolk sac on which the embryo grows in a typically amniote manner . In large-yolked eggs the outline of the embryo is laid out on the blastodisc before the blood vessels begin development . The first sign of the vascular system is a group of rounded blood islands in the extraembryonic mesoderm , each of which soon begins to branch . As lumina ( internal cavities ) appear , the branching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the embryo until a series of vessels is formed on either side of it . Within the embryo a synchronous growth of vessels has formed a pair of ventral veins which grow outward . These unite with the extraembryonic series of vessels and form the vitelline veins , one on either side , which carry food materials from the yolk to the embryo . A continued growth of the vitelline veins carries them anteriorly to the region of the pharynx , where they turn dorsally and join the developing dorsal aortae . The dorsal aortae are at first paired throughout their entire length , and continue posteriorly into the caudal end of the embryo . Immediately posterior to the vitelline veins a group of capilliform vessels is given off from each aorta . These pass outward to the yolk , make contact with the capillaries of the veins , and thus complete the // earliest circulatory system . The small arteries to the yolk later fuse to form a pair of large yolk-sac arteries . At this time the fundamental outline of the circulatory system has developed : ( 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embryo ; ( 2 ) an enlarged region in the anterior portion of these vessels , destined to become the heart ; ( 3 ) the first aortic loop , connecting the ventral vessels with the dorsal ; ( 4 ) the paired dorsal aortae ; and ( 5 ) branches from the aortae , completing the circuit as they pass outward from embryo to yolk . Modifications rapidly appear in the embryo . The vitelline veins begin a fusion to form the heart and a single ventral aorta , and the aortae fuse from the posterior end of the pharynx to the tail so that they form a single dorsal aorta . Synchronously with this , the carotid arteries grow anteriorly from the first aortic loop into the head region and small arteries grow into the tissues from the dorsal aorta . The blood carried out to the body is returned to the developing heart by the cardinal veins . There are two anterior cardinals draining the head and brain and two postcardinals which carry blood from the posterior tissues and the developing kidneys . In the meantime the aortic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have appeared along the pharyngeal wall , and the aortic or branchial loops pass between them . At this stage the chick embryo is essentially like the dogfish adult . In the latter the branchial arches break into capillaries in the gills and form afferent and efferent branchial arches . In the amniotes the arches remain as continuous vessels which undergo various modifications . Amniote embryos of this stage develop an allantois ( page 76 ) from the posterior end of the gut . Veins and arteries are carried with it , and these eventually lie in contact with the chorion . Thus a vascular moist membrane is next to the porous shell and acts as a respiratory structure for the growing embryo . In placentals the allantois induces the development of a placenta ( page 102 ) . The allantoic vessels have the same respiratory function as in the chick and in addition transport food substances which are absorbed through the placenta . In the mammal the allantoic veins and arteries are frequently called umbilical // veins in other amniotes , the embryonic portion of these vessels becomes associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the liver and give rise to the hepatic portal circulation . The anterior ends of the original pair remain as the two hepatic veins . At this stage the system of the amniote embryo does not differ essentially from that of the adult dogfish , with the exception of the allantoic vessels . Future changes in the embryo can best be treated in connection with the comparative study of the different regions of the system , and the developmental changes will be discussed in connection with the comparative anatomy of the vessels . C. DEVELOPMENT OF THE VASCULAR SYSTEM The student at this time should have a concept of the general structure of the vascular system . It is clear that the entire group of structures included in the system is a unified whole , both anatomically and functionally . For convenience the system can be divided into its integral parts and each treated separately . It should be borne in mind that development is synchronous , the entire system growing and developing as a unit in correlation with the growth and differentiation of the other organs . 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscular pulsating ventral aorta . In the cyclostomes the heart is S-shaped , with a single dorsal atrium and a heavywalled ventricle . The blood from the systemic veins empties into a sinus venosus , from which it passes to the atrium and then to the ventricle , and is forced into the ventral aorta . In the larva of the lamprey ( page 35 ) the coelomic cavity surrounding the heart is partly cut off from the body coelom , and in the adult the separation is completed . This coelomic pocket is the pericardial cavity and is found in all the vertebrates . The dogfish heart is essentially similar , with the addition of a conus arteriosus containing numerous cup-shaped semilunar // valves to prevent the back flow of the blood from the ventral aorta . This muscular conus is gradually lost in the higher fish , and the semilunar valves are reduced to a typical three . The crossopterygian fish have in the atrium an incomplete septum , which partially divides this chamber into two . This separation of the primitive atrium into two chambers is complete in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venosus , which receives the body veins , and the two pulmonary veins . The left auricle ( or atrium ) consequently contains aerated blood , and the right is filled with unaerated blood ; but as there is only one ventricle and one auriculoventricular opening , there is necessarily an admixture of blood as it enters the ventral aorta . In this respect the amphibian heart is less efficient than // that of the fish . The conus arteriosus is muscular and is usually guarded by two rows of semilunar valves . The reptiles as a group differ from the amphibia in several important points : ( 1 ) the sinus venosus is small and usually not visible on the outside of the heart ; ( 2 ) the septum of the auricle passes through the auriculoventricular opening so that it cuts the valves into two groups ; and ( 3 ) the ventricle is always more or less divided by a septum into two chambers . The degree of separation in the ventricle varies widely in the different orders . In the turtles and lizards the ventricular septum is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blood from the right auricle is directed by flaps of the valves into the right ( pulmonary ) cavity , the aerated blood entering the left chamber of the ventricle . As the heart contracts , the opening in the septum narrows and forces the unaerated blood of the pulmonary chamber into the pulmonary artery and the aerated blood of the left chamber into the two loops ( radices ) of the ventral aorta . In the alligator the septum is complete , making a four-chambered heart , but there is an opening between the right and left ventral aortae which permits a slight admixture of bloods . The mammal heart is structurally and functionally completely four-chambered . The sinus venosus is left as a vestigial band of tissue within the right auricle . The septum is complete , dividing the heart into left auricle and ventricle and right auricle and ventricle . The auriculoventricular opening is guarded by two sets of valves , each of which is a flap of tissue attached to the inner periphery of the opening , the loose edge held by strands of connective tissue ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ventricles . The left ( mitral ) valve has two cusps , while the right ( tricuspid ) has three . The ventral aorta consists of a single loop ( radix ) and is completely separated from the pulmonary . Therefore the blood is never mixed except in pathological conditions . The heart of the birds is essentially like that of the mammals . Although there appears to be complete homology in the structures of the heart , the terminology in use frequently complicates the situation . Throughout the evolution of the heart the arteries are guarded by cup-shaped valves which are semilunar in // shape . The valves between the atrium and the ventricle of the fish are flaplike and are held in place by tendinous cords , al- ) though these structures are relatively short and wide ; but as the ventricle elongates , each chorda tendinea lengthens and narrows . A similar confusion arises in the use of the terms " atrium " and // " auricle . " The former implies an entrance chamber and is preferable to " auricle " as more descriptive of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single chamber of the fish , while others ( B.N.A. ) limit its use to the mammal . " Auricle " was first applied to the receiving-chambers of the mammal , in which the collapsed chambers resemble little ears ; and as the term is in general use , it has been retained in this description . 2 . DEVELOPMENT OF THE MAMMAL HEART . The heart begins as a fusion of the two vitelline veins and is a single straight tube . As the heart region enlarges and becomes more muscular it assumes an S shape as the posterior ( auricular ) end moves dorsally . The ventricular portion becomes heavily muscled and forces the blood into the ventral aorta as it is received from the auricles . Further growth of the ventricle forces it posteriorly , so that the heart soon has the appearance of the auricles being anterior and the ventricle posterior in position . If the student understands the twisting and growth of the heart , the primitive morphological relationships will be clear . As the septa in the heart develop , the ventricular septum completely cuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left incomplete until after birth ; this opening ( the foramen ovale ) between the two auricles is of functional benefit in embryonic circulation , for the blood is oxygenated in the placenta rather than in the lungs . If the foramen does not close soon after birth the blood is mixed as it enters the aorta and a cyanotic condition results in the individual . So-called " blue babies " are affected by this anomaly . 3 . AORTA AND AORTIC ARCHES . The ventral aorta is the vessel passing out of the pericardial cavity from the heart , along the ventral side of the pharynx . In the early embryonic condition of all vertebrates the aortic or branchial arches pass dorsally to the paired dorsal aortae . The typical number of arches is six , although the cyclostomes and most primitive elasmobranch fishes have a greater number . Beginning with this primitive condition there are many modifications in the groups of vertebrates , but the ontogenetic and phylogenetic histories of the classes are closely parallel . ology of the Human Heart . Drawings ( A ) to ( D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ( E ) is in ventral view . ( F ) is the definitive structure . figure // of blood as it leaves the heart . The separation of aerated and unaerated blood is due to the anterior position of the former in the ventricle , and as the contraction of the heart forces it into the ventral aorta , the first blood takes the line of least resistance into the large ventral vessel and the two radices of the aorta . When the unaerated blood leaves the heart , pressure has developed in the aortae and the pulmonary vessels are filled . The typical reptile has a separation of the pulmonary arteries from the aorta , the separation accompanying the development of the ventricular septum . The pulmonary artery is cut from the ventral aorta by a longitudinal constriction , so that the two vessels leave the heart independently . Due to the structure of the ventricular septum , the pulmonary vessel carries mostly unaerated blood . The heart of the turtle illustrates the functional separation of the blood stream . The width of the ventricle is greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into right and left parts . Not only is the pulmonary artery independent from the embryonic ventral aorta , but the two radices of the aorta ( the two fourth branchials ) leave the heart separately . As the heart contracts , it shortens and the septum approaches the anterior wall , thus guiding the flow of blood as it leaves the heart . The two radices of the aorta receive mostly aerated blood , and from them vessels pass to the head and posterior body . The origin of the arteries from the aortae are highly modified from the embryonic condition and the hypothetical reptilian condition . The alligator and its relatives have the most complete separation of oxygenated and unoxygenated blood of any order of reptiles . The septum of the ventricles is complete , making a fourchambered heart , although the origin of the vessels is atypical . Both the left radix of the aorta and the pulmonary arteries arise from the right ventricle , while the right radix leaves the left ventricle . However , the two radices do not separate completely , and an admixture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left radices . The reptilian heart , therefore , does not show a progressive development toward the mammalian or avian type . The relationship is shown by the embryonic changes . The heart of the bird , like that of the mammal , undergoes // more lateral bending or torsion during its development than does that of the reptile . The septum is complete , passing between the pulmonary artery and the ventral aorta , completely separating aerated and unaerated blood . After the embryonic constriction separates the ventral part of the original aorta with its two pulmonary arteries ( the sixth branchials ) , the two fourth arches are left fused at their bases . The left radix loses its connection with the dorsal aorta and remains as the subclavian artery . The right radix is the aorta of the birds . Mammals are essentially like the birds in the modification of the aortic arches with the exception that the left radix remains as the aorta . The left subclavian , like that of the more primitive vertebrates , is a branch from the aorta ; and the right subclavian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth branchial arch ( the right radix of the reptiles ) . Following is a summary of the degeneration of the aortic arches of the mammal . Recall that in the embryo the ventral aorta is bifurcated from the level of the third arch to its anterior end . Each half of the anterior ventral aorta extends to the head as the external carotid , and the anterior portion of the dorsal aortae form the internal carotids . The common carotids are formed by the divided region of the ventral aorta between the third and fourth arches . Arch I disappears . Arch II disappears . Arch III connects the common carotid with the internal carotid . Arch IV : ( 1 ) the left gives rise to the " aorta " ; ( 2 ) the base of the right connects the aorta with the subclavian . Arch V disappears . Arch VI forms the pulmonary artery . The dorsal half disappears , destroying the connection between the pulmonary and the aorta. 4 . THE CARDIAC CYCLE OF THE MAMMAL . The fetal circulation of the mammal differs widely from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for respiration takes place in the placenta . Consequently , aerated blood comes into the heart through the veins , mixed with unaerated . Blood is carried back to the // placenta through branches of the dorsal aorta , with the result that the blood within the embryo is always mixed . Blood is prevented from going to the unexpanded lungs by three mechanisms : ( 1 ) as the blood pours into the fetal auricles , most of that which falls into the right auricle passes through the opening in the auricular septum ( foramen ovale ) and goes into the left ventricle ; ( 2 ) the mammalian embryo retains the primitive connection between the pulmonary artery and the dorsal aorta ( the distal portion of the sixth arch ) , and this tends to shunt the blood away from the lungs ; and ( 3 ) the pressure within the collapsed lungs prevents the blood from entering . The connecting vessel between the pulmonary artery and the aorta is called the ductus arteriosus ( or ductus Botalli ) . It begins to degenerate soon after birth but may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Breathing is initiated in the newborn mammal by a hypertension of carbon dioxide in the blood , and the ductus arteriosus degenerates in correlation with the function of the lungs . The cardiac cycle depends on the alternate contraction and relaxation of the heart and the flow of blood in one direction through the arteries and veins . The latter is made possible by the system of valves which direct the flow through the heart . These are ( 1 ) the auriculoventricular valves separating the auricles from the ventricles and ( 2 ) the semilunar valves at the base of the aorta and the pulmonary artery . Assume that the heart muscles are completely relaxed . The blood then pours into the auricles from the systemic veins and passes directly into the ventricles . As the ventricles fill , a wave of contraction begins in the auricles , in the node of tissue formed by the primitive sinus venosus . This wave spreads downward , continuing into the ventricles . The swirl of blood in the ventricles has thrown the valves outward , and the ventricular contraction forces them upward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the auricles . The continued contraction of the ventricles forces the blood into the aorta and pulmonary artery . Relaxation occurs in the same order as the contractile wave , and as the pressure in the ventricle decreases , the semilunar valves are forced open by the column of blood in the arteries . The fluid is unable to flow backward into the ventricle and is forced into // the smaller arteries by a wave of contraction in the larger vessels which carries it into the capillaries . The heart completes its relaxation , and the cycle begins anew . The closure of the valves is due to a differential pressure within the regions of the heart and arteries . The sounds of the heart are made by the snap of the valves as they close ; larger auriculoventricular valves have a slightly deeper note . Any weakness or hardening of the valves may cause them to close imperfectly and permit a backflow , so that the regurgitating blood causes a murmur as it rushes past the valves . 5 . THE AORTA AND ITS BRANCHES . In their fundamental plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes of vertebrates . The early appearance and development of the carotid arteries was discussed with the development of the branchial arches . Varying in their point of origin in the classes of vertebrates are the coronary arteries which supply the tissues of the heart and the proximal part of the ventral aorta . In the dogfish they arise from the efferent loops around the third gill pouch and pass posteriorly to the heart muscles . In the amphibia and reptiles they have their origin from the aortic loops or radices of the aorta , depending on the degree of change from the embryonic type . In mammals the two coronary arteries arise from the aorta immediately after its exit from the heart , supply the base of the aorta , and then encircle the heart , their branches ramifying into all parts of the auricles and ventricles . The subclavian arteries supply the pectoral appendages . The vessel receives other names as it passes distally , in accordance with the terminology adopted for human anatomy . It is the axillary artery as it passes the armpit , the brachial in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elbow the two main branches are the radial and ulnas . In the classes which have both radices of the aorta present , the subclavians are given off as branches from each side . The condition in the mammals and birds has been discussed . Posterior to the subclavians the blood vessels can be divided into two groups : ( 1 ) the parietal and ( 2 ) the visceral . The parietal arteries are primitively metameric , although complete metamerism may be lost in the higher animals . In the thoracic // region the parietal arteries pass to the muscles of the back and ribs ; the latter are the intercostal arteries . Posterior to these are the lumbar and sacral arteries . The large iliac arteries , which supply the pelvis and pelvic limbs , are branches from the aorta . In most vertebrates the dorsal aorta is continued into the tail as the caudal artery . The visceral vessels are : ( 1 ) the coeliac axis , which divides into several large vessels supplying the liver , pancreas , stomach , and upper parts of the intestine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more widely distributed in the mammal than in the dogfish , and passes to most of the small intestine in the former class ; ( 3 ) the posterior mesenteric , which supplies the posterior part of the digestive tract , including the colon and rectum . The amniotes have several visceral arteries , arising directly from the dorsal aorta , which in the lower groups are absent or arise as branches from other vessels . The genital arteries are paired and supply the reproductive glands . The adrenal arteries go to the adrenal glands which are located near the kidneys , and the renal arteries go to the kidneys . The latter are present in the dogfish but arise as very small metameric vessels . In the amniotes these are collected into a few vessels or into a single pair as in the mammals . 6 . THE SYSTEMIC VEINS . The systemic veins are those that enter directly into the heart without breaking into capillaries , as distinguished from the portal veins of the liver and primitive organs of excretion . The scheme of systemic circulation of the elasmobranchs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the changes that have occurred in the evolution of the other classes . The veins of the anterior region of the body remain relatively unchanged , although with the degeneration of the sinus venosus there is a tendency toward fusion of the vessels and their entry into the heart without joining the veins from the posterior body . The anterior cardinal veins are known in the higher vertebrates as the internal and external jugular veins , the internal pair draining the brain and upper portion of the head , and the external pair draining the superficial musculature . In the mammal there are frequent anastomoses between the two veins , and 4 ! ' // their independent origin can be seen less clearly . Beginning with the amphibia , there is a fusion of the jugulars on either side ; each is joined by a subclavian to form a cardinal vein . In the mammal the vein formed by the fused jugulars and subclavian is called the innominate , and the right and left innominate veins unite before entering the heart as the precava or anterior vena cava . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the body wall and the paired fins , disappear in the urodeles . However , the abdominal vein arises as a pair of veins which unite ; and this median ventral vessel is regarded as homologous with the lateral veins . The turtle has two abdominal veins , and the alligator has two lateral veins . The vessels are regarded as homologous with the umbilical veins of the mammalian embryo and are not present except during embryonic life . The postcardinal veins are very prominent in the dogfish ; they pass anteriorly from the kidneys and join the anterior cardinals before entering the heart . The further evolution of these veins is intimately correlated with the development of the postcava or posterior vena cava , and the two veins must be considered together . The postcava makes its first appearance in the dipnoan fish . In the urodele amphibia it is a large vessel passing from the anterior level of the kidneys to the right auricle . At the kidneys the vessel divides and passes to each kidney ; it takes over much of the function of the cardinals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the postcava and pass anteriorly to enter the ducts of Cuvier , draining the intercostal muscles and thorax . Embryological development shows the postcava developing from two independent structures . On the median side of either primitive kidney is a subcardinal vein connected with the iliac and caudal veins . From the hepatic vein develops a single vessel which grows posteriorly until it makes connection with the right subcardinal and thus establishes the postcaval circulation . In the reptiles the cardinals lose their posterior connection with the postcava and are small paired vessels draining the thoracic region . The mammal carries these relationships further . The postcava drains the posterior part of the body ( the abdominal veins having disappeared ) , and the cardinal vessels have // further degenerated . The left vein loses its connection with the jugulars and develops one or more transverse connections with the right cardinal of the embryo . The left postcardinal is called the hemiazygos , and the right half , which empties into the jugular , is the azygos . As in the reptiles , it drains the costal muscles . 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been defined as one that breaks into capillaries before reaching the heart . Therefore , a system of vessels forming capillaries in the kidney would be a renal portal . In the dogfish ( page 250 ) the caudal vein divides at the cloaca to form two vessels which establish connections with the lateral veins , and the two branches pass anteriorly to the primitive kidneys ( mesonephroi ) as the subcardinal veins . Each vein gives off branches to the kidney , and these smaller veins break into capillaries . Blood from the posterior region of the body , therefore , may pass to the heart through either of two courses : ( 1 ) directly to the heart through the lateral veins or ( 2 ) through the subcardinals ( renal portal ) to the kidney , from which the blood is collected by the capillaries of the postcardinal veins . A renal portal system of the above type is present , almost fully developed , in the amphibia , although some of the blood from the subcardinals is carried to the heart by the small postcava . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renal portal veins become less important but are still present , despite the fact that the kidney is of the amniote ( mesanephric ) type . In the mammal the renal portal system is present in the embryo in connection with the primitive ( mesonephric ) kidney . The iliac veins join the paired caudal veins , and the subcardinals pass anteriorly toward the kidneys in the primitive manner . However , as the postcava develops , the connections with the renal portal system are lost . The kidney now gets its entire supply of blood from large renal arteries , branches of the dorsal aorta ; and blood from the posterior part of the body passes to the heart through the systemic veins. 8 . THE HEPATIC PORTAL SYSTEM . It has been mentioned that he paired omphalomesenteric vessels pass anteriorly around the // liver to the heart . As the liver tubules develop , the right omphalomesenteric is interrupted and breaks into capillaries . This condition persists for a short time ; then the left vein breaks into capillaries , and the system is completed . The , earliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the subintestinal vein breaks into small vessels which reunite before entering the ventral aorta . In the elasmobranch fishes the system is fully developed , and with minor changes it remains in all the classes of vertebrates . Blood from the liver is carried to the heart by the two hepatic veins , which belong with the systemic vessels . 9 . THE BLOOD SYSTEM AS A WHOLE . The evolutionary changes that occur in the classes of vertebrates have been discussed as parts of the blood system rather than as the comparative anatomy of the system as a whole . The diagrams ( Figures 164-173 ) of the arteries and veins of typical representatives of the separate classes will review the specializations of these systems . In the tetrapods the arterial modifications have centered around ( 1 ) the degeneration of the aortic arches and their connections with each other and ( 2 ) around the division of the heart by a septum . Correlated with these changes there has been a shift in the respiratory mechanism in the amphibia and the progressive separation of oxygenated and unoxygenated blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mammals one of the radices of the aorta is lost , and the blood is led from the heart through two major routes , pulmonary and systemic . The venous modifications have centered largely around the development of the postcava , draining the posterior body , and the loss of the abdominal veins and the renal portal system . With the exception of the heart , the birds and mammals have a rather simple vascular system as compared with those of more primitive classes . The venous system of the bird is much nearer that of the reptile , with a slight renal portal connection , although these vertebrates have a heat-control mechanism and a high metabolic rate , functions which are highly correlated with the separation of oxygenated blood as it passes out to the tissues of the organs . But , although they are functionally similar to the // mammals , the apparent similarity in the structure of the heart is the product of a parallel evolution , since the birds have evolved from a reptilian group widely different from the ancestral line of the mammals . The following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mammal will illustrate the unity of the vascular system . The heart consists of four chambers , the atria ( auricles ) are anterior and the ventricles posterior after the embryonic bending and torsion are completed . It is roughly triangular in longitudinal section , the apex pointing backward and usually located in the fifth intercostal space ; that is , between the fifth and sixth rib cartilages . During development the heart shifts from its median position so that about two-thirds lie on the left side of the midline and the axis of the organ passes from right to left . Blood leaves the heart through the aorta , which turns dorsally from right to left . A few inches from its base the innominate artery is given off ; this gives rise to the right common carotid and the right subelavian . Next is given off the left common carotid and then the left subclavian . The development of the aortic arches will make the relationship clear . The external branch of the carotids passes to the muscles of the neck and face ; the internal branch goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brain the two internal carotids anastomose , forming a circle of vessels . The aorta , passing posteriorly along the ventral side of the vertebrae , gives off the metameric parietal arteries to the ribs and body muscles and several esophageal branches . Next are the plirenic arteries to the diaphragm which separates the pleural cavities from the abdominal cavity . The large coeliac axis is next , going to the viscera , and then in order : ( 1 ) the superior mesenteric ; ( 2 ) the paired suprarenal ( adrenal ) vessels ; ( 3 ) the paired renals ; ( 4 ) the paired spermatic ( genital ) arteries to the gonads ; ( 5 ) the inferior mesenteric to the colon and rectum ; and 16 ) the sacral artery . Immediately posterior to the last the aorta divides to form the two large iliac arteries which supply the pelvic limbs . The numerous branches of the latter need not be discussed . The external jugular vein , after making connections with the internal jugular , enters the subelavian . The internal jugular // fuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are approximately the same on both sides . The two innominate veins then coalesce and form the superior vena cava , which enters the right auricle . The metameric costal veins are a part of the azygos , which empties into the superior vena cava . The posterior part of the body is drained by the inferior vena cava ( postcava ) . The external and internal iliac veins fuse to form the paired common iliacs , which unite at the level of the sacrum to form the vena cava . This large vessel receives blood from the renal veins , which are joined by the spermatics . Next in order are the suprarenals and the phrenic veins . The vena cava then passes through the liver and empties into the auricle . The hepatic portal system is composed of the following major branches : ( 1 ) the superior mesenteric ; ( 2 ) splenic ; ( 3 ) inferior mesenteric ; ( 4 ) gastric ; and ( 5 ) the pyloric vein . The completed hepatic portal vessel is short , and as it reaches the liver it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the larger vessel . In the liver the vessels break into capillaries and sinuses . The blood from the liver is collected into several small veins , and the two large hepatic veins which enter the vena cava before it passes through the diaphragm . D. LYMPHATIC SYSTEM Although the veins and arteries of the vertebrate form a closed system , a certain amount of the blood fluid passes through the capillary walls or is forced through their intercellular spaces . This fluid is the lymph and lacks most of the corpuscles or cells of the blood and some of the coagulating elements . The lymph bathes each cell of the body and carries food materials and free oxygen . This fluid is collected from the tissues by a definite system of vessels called the lymphatics and is returned by them to the veins . Failure of the lymphatic system to function properly causes an accumulation of fluid in the tissues or body cavities , and the affected region becomes swollen or edematous . There are many other causes of edema ( infections , heart trouble , and others ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // The lymphatic system also functions in collecting the fats absorbed by the digestive tract . Each villus which projects into the lumen of the intestine is supplied with a minute lymphatic duct in addition to the vein and artery . The fats pass through the lining epithelium into the lacteals or lymphatic ducts of the villi and through them into the main lymphatic stream . The whitish , fat-laden fluid is known as chyle , and the lymphatics from the intestine are frequently called chyle ducts . As a result of these two functions of the lymphatic system , the lymph entering the veins has a high content of fats and waste products and a low content of oxygen , carbohydrates , and proteins . Both in phylogeny and ontogeny there is a reduction in the extent of the lymphatic system . In the primitive vertebrate and in the embryo there are large irregular lymph sinuses , and these become reduced to a definite system of vessels ; the system occupies relatively less space in the more specialized animal . In the cyclostomes and fish the lymphatic capillaries collect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . The largest is below the vertebral column and lies around the dorsal aorta . Others are in the ventral body wall and underneath the skin . A single lymphatic vessel drains each of the sinuses , and these efferent ducts fuse to form four main ducts which empty into the veins . The anterior two join the veins at the junction of the jugulars with the subclavians , and the posterior two enter either the caudal or the iliac veins . At the point where the lymphatic vessel leaves the sinus there is a pulsating lymph heart forcing the lymph toward the veins . Each of the lymph hearts is protected by valves which keep the fluid flowing in the same direction . The lymph hearts are retained by the amphibia , particularly the urodeles . In the anura ( frogs and toads ) the hearts are definitely smaller and the anterior hearts disappear . Almost the same condition is found in the lower reptiles . The crocodiles and alligators retain the two posterior hearts , but the large dorsal sinuses are reduced to thoracic lymph ducts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although there are both anterior and posterior connections with the venous system . In both reptiles and birds there is an increase in the number of the smaller lymphatic vessels , and the system takes on the appear286 STRUCTURE OF THE VERTEBRATES ance of a definite group of vessels leading from the intercellular spaces and digestive tract to the veins . The mammalian lymphatic system shows the following changes : ( 1 ) the terminal capillaries ramify more fully through the tissues ; ( 2 ) there are no definite sinuses except minute ones in several glands ; ( 3 ) the posterior openings into the veins are lost , and the entire body lymph enters the veins through the two anterior connections with the subclavians ; ( 4 ) the area drained by the right lymphatic duct is limited to the right half of the head and thoracic region , while the left duct drains the left anterior half and the entire posterior part of the body ; and ( 5 ) lymph nodes develop . The lymph nodes of the mammal are ovoid masses of glandular connective tissue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follicles . The lobe has a center of blood capillaries surrounded by small lymphatics . The connective tissue is characterized by rather close-packed small cells with relatively large nuclei without any definite arrangement . The largest lymph nodes are in the neck , the axilla ( armpit ) , and groin . The lymph nodes have a double function : ( 1 ) the formation of certain white blood cells and ( 2 ) filtration of the blood . In many types of infection the lymph nodes swell because of the concentration of bacteria at these points . Similar masses of lymphatic tissue appear in other parts of the body : the mesenteries ; the intestine , where they are called Peyer 's patches ; the thymus ; and the adenoidal tissues of the nasopharynx . DEVELOPMENT . The mammalian lymphatics begin development as several outpocketings from the veins at the junction of the jugulars and subclavians . As these grow anteriorly and posteriorly lymph hearts appear , and from the latter many branches grow out into the tissues . The branches continue dividing until the entire system of vessels is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is little evidence to support the theory that the lymphatic vessels have a double origin , with the capillaries arising as enlarged intercellular spaces independent of the outpocketings from the veins . The terminations of the lymphatic capillaries are closed ; the lining cells of all the vessels are similar and continuous ; and the em288 STRUCTURE OF THE VERTEBRATES bryological evidence supports the idea that the vessels arise from localized centers of growth . As the lymph hearts of the embryo degenerate the lymph nodes develop and all signs of sinuses disappear . The vessels and nodes are relatively more prominent in the young than in the adult . The chyle ducts enter the left lymphatic duct . SPLEEN . With the possible exception of the cyclostomes and fish , in which lymphatic tissue is widely diffused , the spleen is the largest single mass of lymphatic tissue . It varies in shape from an elongated straplike organ to a spherical node suspended in the mesenteries . It is associated with the blood-forming tissues , and in the primitive vertebrates and the embryos of the more specialized classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marrow of the long bones takes over this function , the spleen develops only lymphocytes in the normal animal . The minute details of the structure of the spleen are not thoroughly understood even in man . The arteries divide until capillaries hardly larger in diameter than a red blood corpuscle are formed . Their terminations are not known . The veins arise from venous sinuses , cavities of irregular size , of the spleen . By some anatomists it is thought that no connections exist between the capillaries and the sinuses , in which event the spleen has an open circulation as opposed to the closed circulation of all other parts of the body . In the mammal the spleen apparently stores red blood corpuscles and is the organ in which these cells are destroyed through the action of phagocytic leucocytes . E. STRUCTURE OF THE BLOOD The blood is a fluid tissue ( page 115 ) acting as the distributing medium of the body . It is composed of discrete cells or corpuscles floating in a fluid medium . The latter is the plasma and is composed of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activated is the clotting element , precipitating and leaving the clear serum and thus coagulating the blood . Lymph is the serous portion of the fluid with less fibrinogen than is found in the normal plasma . The corpuscles of the blood // are of two types : ( 1 ) red cells or erythrocytes and ( 2 ) white cells or leucocytes . LEUCOCYTES . The white cells of the blood are very similar throughout the vertebrates , although the relative proportion of the various cell types varies widely . The leucocytes are divided into two major groups : ( 1 ) agranulocytes , which have a clear cytoplasm lacking granules , and ( 2 ) granulocytes , which have the cytoplasm loaded with granules . The nongranular cells are the lymphocytes and the large mononuclear leucocytes . The granular cells include the mast cells of the blood and the polymorphonuclear cells . 1 . Lymphocytes are small cells which arise in the lymph tissues , particularly the lymph nodes of the mammals . They have It single nucleus almost as large as the cell . In man these form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mononuclear cells have a single often crescentic nucleus and are the largest of the white corpuscles. 3 . Mast cells have granules taking a basic stain and are regarded by many investigators as degenerate cells . They form less than one per cent of the leucocytes in normal blood . // 4 . Polymorphonuclear leucocytes have nuclei which assume many shapes , often giving the appearance of being divided into several distinct nuclei . They are ameboid in appearance and are actively phagocytic ( that is , they ingest foreign particles ) . These cells form about seventy-four per cent of all leucocytes in man . The great majority show a neutral staining reaction , but a few take an acid stain . The granulocytes are classified according to their staining reactions and the size of the granules . The proportion of leucocyte types is of clinical value , since the blood count indicates different physiological conditions . Most of the white cells are phagocytic and therefore have a definite function in preventing infections . Pus is made of dead white cells and serum . In human blood there are approximately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The red cells contain haemoglobin , which has a strong affinity for oxygen ; the combination of the two is an unstable chemical compound . Because of this instability , the oxygen is liberated in the capillaries and passed to the tissues . Internal respiration depends on the amount of oxygen carried to the cells , and insufficient oxygenation may be caused either by a lowered haemoglobin content in each cell or by a depletion in the number of red cells in the blood . There is a wide difference in the chemical capacity of haemoglobin to combine with oxygen , and this blood protein is believed to be different in each genus of vertebrate . Erythrocytes vary markedly in size and structure in different vertebrates . With the exception of mammals all vertebrates have nucleated erythrocytes , most of them are elliptical in shape . The largest are found in urodele amphibia ; Amphiuma has the largest of all animals ( approximately 70 micra for the greater diameter , about ten times the diameter of the red cells of man ) . Although they are of essentially the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they grow progressively smaller . The number of red corpuscles in each cubic millimeter is roughly correlated with their size . In the amphibia the number varies from 36,000 ( Proteus ) to about 700,000 ( Ilyla ) . In man there are on the average four and one-half to five millions per cubic millimeter.
