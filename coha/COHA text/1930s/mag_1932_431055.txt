 | WHAT can be more ridiculous ! ! Than what ? Than that the admirable old gentleman , Law and Order , nationally and internationally , should be so respectable and majestic and at the same time so stupid . Why stupid ? Because against his enemies of violence , waste , disorder , wilfulness , and audacity ? against war and crime and misdoings and chaos ? he fails to use one of his most powerful weapons , the almost unused arm of ridicule . What can be more ridiculous than that ? Do not treat lightly what I am going to say merely because I first state three examples where ridicule won victories for beast , man , and child . Even the animals know the power of derision . I have owned smarter dogs than my Larry , and I have learned to train them well without violence . But though Larry dislikes scolding and hates to be confined in our laundry , he never really is upset until we laugh at him . He is almost ill when we treat him as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public positions , one where some pomp and puffery might have been put on parade by me , but when I wanted to bring a stubborn personality around to the hitching post of world equity or home-made horse sense , I always tried to remember the method I used in extremity with my two children when they were very young . They have been , even from the crib days , astute enough to play the game of life ; they rarely presented any problems . The exception was the rare moment when they became audacious , stubborn little " repeaters , " as the criminologists say . Then the something-hadto-be-done moment arrived . Loathe to engage in severe measures involving haste and suggesting parental anger , I suddenly became inspired . I demanded that the bottle of iodine and the tiny brush be employed . In the end the punishment , though seldom needed , was self-inflicted . The iodine was used to paint indelible mustaches and goatees upon faces otherwise dignified . The result was sure-fire . The children , unable to face the ridicule of playmates , music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retreat , and always came out , after I had removed the stains by my secret process , good-naturedly asking to call the whole thing off . Now , here is the astonishing factor in my experiment . Some mothers and fathers who either used the back of the hairbrush in haste and in the flush of the mightwill-make-right passion , or perhaps tried the discipline system of nagging , wheedling , cajoling , and usually lying to the children ? a system feeble , flabby , and doomed to failure ? exclaimed that my rarely-used method of ridicule was " brutal , fiendish , heartless " ! Such exactly is the minority sentiment we encounter when society has brains enough to suggest applying the discipline of ridicule to misbehaving peoples and nations , to misbehaving criminals , especially young criminals , and to all our enemies arrayed against peaceful and ordered living . Before I state some suggestions about our unused weapon of derision , before I give examples of the power of laughter against war , organized crime , and indiidual delinquency , let me step up one more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find an example of informal corrective ridicule applied to a grown-up . One of my friends was a Colonel during the War . He had a distinguished fighting record in the Argonne sector . I know the rank and file loved him because policeman and truck drivers , young doctors and newspaper men , waiters and even bootleggers ? after more than a decade since he was their leader in war ? stop his car to pass the time of day , or come to his door when in grief or trouble , or call him Major , and Colonel , and Boss , and by his nickname at casual meetings . He put the whole of himself into the game of getting a regiment of men who would follow him at his whistle , whether in war or in peace , into whatever crater of hell or trouble they might face ? just because it was his whistle and their ears heard it and knew it . @#  | Well , he had an awkward squad ? men who either could not or would not drill properly . Some did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not stay abreast in line . And the worst of them all was a big goofus called Ed . It was comparatively easy to cure the difficulties of the others , but Ed would not or could not stay abreast . Finally the drill sergeant lost his temper . He told the Colonel that he had come to the conclusion that Ed was not incapable , but was " soldiering . " He wanted to put him in the guard house . The Colonel took thought . How could any one be sure that Ed was not doing his best . He , the Colonel , would see . Whether any one else had devised the plan before my friend , the Colonel , did I do not know . This is what he did : he ordered a sapling cut ? a straight young trunk weighing about forty pounds . The weather was hot . The regiment came out for its drill . The Colonel gave orders for parade rest and called for the awkward squad . " Now , " said he , " humanity often gets out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . We get out of line with the neighbors . We get out of line with the authorities . And some just ca n't seem to get in line in as simple a matter as drill . So the dozen men in the awkward squad can tike hold of that pole , and that will keep then in line . " Then , with sniggers from the regiment , one by one the awkward squad were complimented by the Colonel and dismissed , until only Ed was holding the heavy pole , perspiration rolling off , red in the face , with the roars of a regiment in his ears , as he marched under the broiling sun and turned , wheeled , and doubled again , and " kept in line with himself . " The job was done . After that experience Ed had little trouble keeping in line . What scolding , threats , and punishment failed to do , ridicule did ! Let us now apply the suggestion of ridicule , this almost unused weapon of society , as it might be used against the two greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is crime . The other is war . I shall risk derision to become very much in earnest . Ca n't we make crime appear silly ? I say we can . Can ' Mars be made to blush and appear sheepish , with a sickly grin ? I say yes . We have lost our balance when we grow so solemn and ponderous about the public enemy , as organized crime is called . Must we talk about the League of Nations and the World Court and pacts for peace in a deep ministerial voice ? ' Must we treat some absurd and solemn and futile gestures against war without any sense of humor ? - Must we see only the tragic side of war itself ? If we were a little bigger , would n't we often be able to laugh it off the stage in ways I am about to suggest ? In the first place , should n't we giggle when movements to prevent war and papier-mache plans to end war succeed mostly in signing a few documents , pinning a few peace medals on expectant chests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before excitable little minds ? Often in my experiences in European diplomacy , as representative of the United States , I have said with a laugh : " Ca n't we stop this absurdity of ringing alarms and of solemnly prohibiting war ? Ca n't we do something here to recognize the reasons for peace , and build peace and take the bass drum away from war and give peace a few whangs on it ? " Must we go on taking the racketeer and the organized **30;892;TOOLONG criminals so solemnly ? And when I got that far in talking to the editor , he grew serious indeed and said , " Suppose we took Al Capone and made him sweep street crossings , or go down Michigan Boulevard every day carrying a sign or a transparency saying , I 'm the Great Capone ? the biggest racketeer of History ? the Cupid of ' Em All . ' " " That is what I mean , " I said to the editor . " Exactly what I mean . We are leaving our weapon of ridicule , of derision , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do n't laugh at ( Continued on page iSi ) 27  | crime and war ; we do n't make them ridiculous . We fail to make war appear as silly as it usually ? if not invariably ? is and to make those human beings who get drawn into a mess for every one such as the last war turned out to be , appear even sillier . It is no joke ! " Strange as it may seem , the learned Wickersham Commission , which made a study of crime and issued certain reports , never said anything about making crime and the criminal ridiculous . I do not mean to belittle the labors of these vexed and learned men , who were unselfish , patriotic , and conscientious , but it does seem to some of us that they were a bit like a fire department which , when an alarm was turned in , began to discuss the cause of the fire . Even my blue-nosed Puritan ancestors had more imagination ! They advocated a policy of putting offenders into stocks or tieing placards around their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which may not be up to the improved form of joshing the criminal . We could readily engage in more modernistic styles , were we appointed in these days to the post of the merry ringmaster of the racketeers . Some of us not belonging to the scientific statistical crimecure monopoly , now held by a few professors , might take these gangsters for a real jolly ride . Give me Will Rogers , Charles Evans Hughes at his best self as legal adviser , and also Mrs. Alice Roosevelt Longworth and Marie Dressler and Calvin Coolidge as he really is and not as you think he is , and a few others , and we would be able to pull down crime from its dignity and push off criminals from the pedestals of heroic importance which learned Law , solemn Research , pale Psycho-Analysis , and strident Publicity have given them . Having started a good deal of our own national interest in crime and rackets by a publication of my own survey done in unscientific and hence understandable fashion some five or more years ago , and having been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested great and meritorious men in 1926 , and even of being to blame for the gangster talking pictures which now have so sickened us , I want to make up a little for my sins , if any , by asking Justice to take off her blindfold and honestly find out whether Ridicule is n't a new statesman waiting for a job at the employment agency . A good deal of the crime survey I undertook was done with a microscope . I am doubtful about the professorial telescope ? regardless of at which end the erudite eye happens to be fixed . I learned that the gangster can stand a lot of almost anything except being made an ass . That gets him . No one knew this better than Lord Darling . I used to subscribe to the London Times when he was Mr. Justice Darling , just to see how his humorous interpolations during a trial could strip away the heroism , the dignity , and the self-satisfaction of all those who wo n't keep step with the rest of us . It is said , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " coming up for sentence said : " Mr. Justice , I am tired of B Prison . I 'd like to go to M Gaol this time . " " Ah , " said Darling , " but you see I could accommodate you there for only four years . " Ridicule can go far ? even in our own land of unimaginative reluctances on the part of majestic Law ' Of course it can not go so far and so quickly as under a Mussolini . The story that beggars were cleaned out of Italian cities not by arresting them but by giving them brooms and making them sweep streets , I have not substantiated . In a painstaking investigation of the cleaning out of the Mafia in Sicily , however , I saw how effective ridicule could be . Not only did a vigorous wholesale criminal prosecu- tion send the blackmailers , the bandits , and the witness-intimidators " to the Islands , " but the Fascist authorities , realizing that the gangster 's families had amassed wealth , encouraged civil suits by their victims , made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? broke them . To cap this merry jest against the Sicilian public enemy , the Prefect publicly begged charity for this or that impoverished group of the bandits ' unfortunate children ! This really did make banditry look washed out ! ' While I had the job of being Ambassador to Italy , one of our American parlor " reds " landed in Naples without a passport . He was promptly arrested , and he appealed to me . He had come to inspect the prisons on the islands , which he had heard were the familiar " blot on Civilization . " His beard was pointed , and so was the top of his bald head , but he burned with inner fires . Now , of course , Mussolini 's government could have sent him back on he next ship . Instead , an interview was arranged with II Duce himself , who , highly amused , offered my socially respectable and anarchistic countryman a steamer to visit everything he wished to see ! Courtesies were heaped upon him . Complained the crestfallen Internationalist who had refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he would send a band and an escort of soldiers to see me off on my tour of inspection . I do n't seem to get anywhere in Italy . I think I 'm off to Switzerland tomorrow . This man Mussolini has a very poor sense of humor ! " The much despised kings and queens of the world 's historical background , because of their powers , often had fine opportunities to show the use of derision in curling up their enemies . Catherine of Russia did it quite beautifully at times . Queens even more than kings rose to this height of imagination and thus , by the way , indicated that women can aid substantially in directing the right kind of derision against crime and against war . When that grim and clever old lady , the Empress Dowager of China , found an English woman journalist prowling inside the sacred precincts of the Forbidden City , did she have the foreigner arrested ? Not she ! She was told by the Englishwoman that the invasion was due to a desire to write up the inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old vixenEmpress had everything moved about , changed the court costumes into grotesque garbs , invited the foreigner to attend such absurd ceremonies that the ladies-in-waiting could barely restrain their laughter . And the Englishwoman solemnly wrote a book about this hocus-pocus ! Unfortunately we who are involved in a more democratic machinery , particularly with the restraints upon judges and the tendency to crystallize everything by detailed legislation , are hampered in our full use of ridicule . And yet we have a longunused tether for derision-by-law . Probably the best place to use ridicule is in the cases of the juvenile offender . I commend my iodine mustachios to the juvenile courts of these United States . A few daisy chains around the neck of the " tough boy " of the neighborhood would prevent the hatching of a gangster with a machine gun . The placard to be worn on pain of ending the suspension of a more serious sentence could be offered as alternative to the penalties prescribed . Even the semi-humorous loading of responsibility onto the juvenile offender has seldom been utilized . That in itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mori in Sicily , when he found it difficult to obtain evidence against many good young rural bandits of the Mafia stripe , offered to take them into the police system , gave them badges , invited them to take the oath of allegiance to the Fascisti Government after Mass , and , appealing to their sense of the romantic , made many of them good , unflinching servants of the State . Would that more of our judges would be or could be empowered by law and . sense to apply the same principle ! When we used to play Indian and cowboy , the gang which had the best uniforms and paraphernalia of pomp always became the more powerful . Why let the racketeer and gangster , aided by press and professor , obtain the upper hand in terms of romantic manners and customs , adventure , leadership , heroism , and audacity ? Has the organized State become so stupid that it can not better dramatize for the individual youth our battle to keep the fortress of organization and our romping adventure when we sally forth to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? My uncle , at times a most unscrupulous man himself , once changed for the better the whole course of life of a boy said to be incorrigible by giving him a pair of pants he untruthfully described as having belonged formerly to the Prince of Wales ! He added , " If you steal while you are wearing them , I shall write the Prince and all England will be laughing at us . " The first instinct of Theodore Roosevelt under whom I received my first political experiences , whenever he was told of a malcontent within our ranks was to say , " That man should be given a hard job to do at once . ' And although this was not primarily a method of ridicule , it seldom failed to direct at the disturber the vague and unexpressed opinion of his fellows that the joke was now on him . It was a subtle and generous measure of giving opportunity along with discipline . Let other : follow Roosevelt 's example ! I believe , when I sum up my impressions of  | juvenile and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclination would be to make them look silly ; my second would be to wish upon them a responsibility they had not expected ; and only thereafter would I consider the mere uncreative punishment we now so often impose . Then there is that other great field of " little crime " ? the misdemeanors . What a lack of a sense of humor is ours when we treat misdemeanors in the same ponderous machinery and with the same mannerisms with which we treat real crimes ! The theory back of misdemeanors ought to be the theory that the State has been injured , and is out to collect damages ? real damages and sometimes punitive damages also . Why crowd the courts with these cases until the bill for damages is presented to the offender , and the offender has refused to pay ? In accordance with that theory the Fascists had a plan to furnish police and certain public employees , such as train conductors , ' ithabook of fine-collection tickets with numbered stubs . For instance , if you put your dirty feet upon the opposite seat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You could pay about fifty cents , and the whole transaction except the accounting between the conductor and the treasury based on the stubs was over . If you contested the case , you gave your name and address , disclosed your identity , and the ticket was turned into a court summons with heavy penalties for non-appearance . I merely state this example , first , to show that sometimes imagination can put misdemeanors where they belong . I see no reason against a carefullyguarded system in America by which police could collect " on the spot " the fixed damages to the state of petty offenses , with the proviso , of course , that if the accused wished to dispute the matter he could pay and then insist on a court review of it and accept the ticket , then properly endorsed as his own summons . Of course this would not avoid all misdemeanor arrests , but it would no doubt dispose of seventy percent of them . " Why not paint on the wind-shields of automobiles a red line for every proved or pleadguilty ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PERHAPS some one can answer better than I. At any rate , the shorter the process of making the misdoer settle for his act , the more ridiculous he appears . I remember the merry Italian laughter which went up when I was caught with my feet on the opposite seat of the train and had to pay . But this laughter did me good . It taught me that I was not " in line " ? too individualistic ? and hence I was the butt of the public will . Courts cost money to taxpayers . They often appear the stern and humorless enemies of the individual without much presence of the will of the people , properly dramatized . They treat casual offenders , by no means criminals , even in the making , as if they were real criminals already launched on their future careers . Shortcuts and the laugh of the crowd would be so much better ! Then before we get onto the subject of laughing war off ? we must think of the real criminal , too . I do not mean that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main purpose of having any laws at all . That is the way the sobbers and the so-called scientists treat him . One would think our whole system of law , police , courts , and prisons was to catch laboratory material for reformers and psychologists . On that idea the whole country has gone " a bit on the balmy side , " as the cockneys say . Of course , modern criminal law is not for anger or revenge , either . But it is obviously , as it ought to be , directed toward tieing a cost tag on to misdeeds . I do not ask that this cost tag state too high a price , but I do ask that the cost to the criminal in terms of punishment should be collected , and collected as near the time and place as possible . The main thing is to see that the " joke " is on the crook . I do not even rate highly , after twenty years ' experience with the crime subject , the importance of confining behind stone and iron those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is mostly the stupid and silly who make up our 200,000 jail population ; the real criminals are politically organized so that they seldom go " inside . " The true value of a cost tag on crime is to deter from crime the others , youths in particular , who know enough to avoid paying that price on the tag . One of the prices which I have found out , from statesmen ' , diplomats , and foreign offices down to the underworld , costs most to human dignity , to ego and self-complacency , is the cost of being made ridiculous . For instance , were laws so adjusted , I have no doubt that a pink crepe hung upon the door of a gangster or a white feather in his hat for a year would give him more pain than a turn in the penitentiary . A few eesthetic dancing classes for hold-up men in Central Park , New York City , conducted by a woman instructor in pale blue drapery would do more to make assaults go out of fashion than the gun squad and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Fifth Avenue or down Michigan Boulevard , once a month , of second felony offenders carrying paper lilies might be a most effective adjunct to , or even be a substitute for , a board bill at Sing Sing or Joliet . I exaggerate , of course . Nevertheless I would make it silly to be crooked . I would make it sissified to be tough . I would make it ridiculous to be organized against society . Were I a dictator I would put the gangster or racketeer on a flower-show float , dragged by jackasses , and on their knees , before his tinsel throne , would make his lieutenants kneel and scatter confetti . Why it is that we who want organized society to have its way have not yet touched the possibilities of ridicule ? I can not explain . It is ridiculous that it is so , but it is so . AFTER crime , which is on our minds or necks these , days , there is war ? the other public enemy . I say that a lot can be done to laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomats and by economic leaders if they had the sense . It can surely be done by the masses . In either case the method of Statesmen Ridicule has none of the frumpery of much of our document-signing , of empty pacts , of alliances for peace which are almost invariably , in their reality , military and naval agreements ? or empty nothings . Nor would Statesman Ridicule beat upon any proud inflated chest . Instead of putting out absurd inconsistencies and hypocrisies , Ridicule would expose them . As an example , I have , of ten told how , when at the Conference of Lausanne ori behalf of the Armenians , I was arguing that Turkey should set aside a rich territory for a national Armenian homeland , a Turkish diplomat met my arguments by saying to me that Turkey , might admit that Armenians were the aborigines of the land , and indeed would set aside territory for them , whenever the United States set aside the State of Pennsylvania for the American Indians . Krassin , the great business lieutenant of Lenin , once came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . I spoke of the fact that we considered it indefensible that Russia had repudiated her international debts and bonds . " Have not several of your own states done so from time to time ? " asked Krassin . England and the United States ? which appeared so shocked because Germans in Belgium took reprisals against " snipers " , who fired at their troops are the same nations whose own armed forces took reprisals of the same kind at Canton , China , and Vera Cruz . The same nations which shot down women spies ? no matter how noble ? were the nations most horrified  | because one of their own women nationals was executed for acting for a spy system . The new Statesman Ridicule would at least set up a School for Consistency ' If the Japanese had said to us , " Hands off in-Nicaragua ! " would it be any different from our crying to Japan " Hands off in Manchuria " ? One sees that the statecraft of mere bullying power or mere silly meddling in others ' businesses could be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and near-Orientals know this much better than we . Tchitcherin , the late conductor of the diplomacy of the Soviets , had no end of fun with the world . I could not restrain laughing with him , when at the Conference of Genoa which was aimed at bringing Russia into economic unity with European nations , all the nations became enraged because Russia , without asking by your leave , actually signed an economic treaty with Germany ! " There was so much talk , " piped the birdlike Tchitcherin , " that I thought I would begin the good work ! " Again at the first significant Disarmament Conference at Geneva the Russians gave the world the laugh of a decade when they proposed to " go the whole hog " and ask every nation to disarm absolutely and completely , to wipe out at one stroke every vestige of the world 's armament budget . Hypocrisy was all that was left to many nations then , and Hypocrisy had very little more than a bath towel left to hide in . I STATE merely these instances among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by ridicule in diplomacy and international statecraft . Aimed at good ends , ridicule would save many a war , dissipate many a war-scare , dissolve many a war phobia . It would proceed against war on more solid ground than ponderous notes , show-window conferences with their absurd communiques ; indeed it would step on more pavement of reality than those Sprigo ' - Flowers peace movements which many statesmen , presidents , and premiers bow to , with a vgte-getting gallantry , and then ? unless they be the lily diplomats we sometimes develop ? proceed to forget . The masses , however ? the common sense and humor of mankind ? can volunteer if it can not be conscripted to laugh war off . I do not mean that all war can be laughed away . That in itself would be ridiculous . But we could begin on that worst of all betrayers of mankind ? wartime propaganda . One thing is sure . If leaders can keep us out of war by propaganda , they can put us into war by propaganda . If we had any appraisal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had become , we would summon ridicule to our own defense . Nor would we need any organizing , paid secretary , nor a Foundation nor a National Society For , in order to call for ridicule out-of the mouth of our enlightened good sense . " What 's all this ? " we would say . " Hightytighty now ! Hold your horses . Who said that all those foreigners wear horns ? Are n't we to blame a bit ourselves ? What will it cost ? What will we get ? And if we go into it , are n't we like the passenger who handed the conductor a nickel . The conductor said That 's lead . ' The passenger said , No , it ai n't , ' and the war was on . And when the passenger got out of the mud and dust and picked the nickel out of his ear ? it was lead . Well , ' said the conductor panting , do n't cry over spilled milk , brother . We were fightin ' not for a nickel but for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war ? when it is a good war . - But I am not for war when it is going to make me feel silly . It goes against the grain . It is like sand in the bread . Pam not for war when it is a ridiculous measure . We can often make it so by ridicule . This certainly does not mean lapghing at other peoples : the idea is to laugh with them , at war .
