txt A group of eight western trunk line railroads , some of which are in trusteeship. may receive within the next few months a substantial increase in their revenues from transcontinental traffic . The Interstate Commerce Commission is giving active consideration to complaints that the transcontinental lines . or those operating west of Omaha and St. Paul . are receiving more than their fair share of the revenues on crosscountry traffic , and may soon order a new basis for dividing these earnings . Estimates of the aggregate sum by which revenues of the western trunk line roads might be increased under a " fair and equitable " division of rates range as high as $10.090,000 . The carriers which would benefit are the Alton ; Chicago Ea North Western : Chicago , Burlington &; Quincy : Chicago Great Western : Chicago , Rock Island &; Pacific : Chicago . St. Paul , Minneapolis &; Omaha ; Illinois Central , and Wabash . No Recent Important Revision Action of the Commission in throwing open the entire question of transcontinental divisions has brightened the hopes of the roads of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of divisions has not been changed materially since 1925 , when the western lines got some increases , and has not been reviewed by the ICC ' since 1934 . At the present time the transcontinental roads , or those which originate most of the traffic and have the longer haul , receive around SI% of the revenue with the western trunk lines getting about 16% . The contention has been made that on a mileage basis . the trunk lines should get approximately 19% . Some carriers contend that a " fair " division would give them 22% of the revenue . Charges have been made before the ICC , the Wheeler Senate committee and elsewhere that an unfair division of transcontinental revenue was a contributory cause of several rail bankruptcies and has augmented the financial difficulties of the western lines . Present Arrangement On the present basis for dividing these revenues . the transcontinental roads get an allowance of 1.25 miles for each mile they haul traffic as compared with a strict mile per mile for the western roads . Some rail officials contend this situation should be reversed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally were fair , the ICC said that the cost of service , including the burden on the roads of carrying the necessary investment , should be the factor of primary importance in fixing the division of rates . The Commission said , however , that no satisfactory accounting records had been produced at that time to make it possible to translate costs into terms of dollar . and cents . So far as the cost of service is concerned , the trunk line roads contend that while the grades and curves in their territory are not so severe as those in the mountainous country , a succession of short grades are encountered . which are not long enough to justify helper service but do limit the tonnage ratings of the engines . This has an important bearing on costa . These roads further contend that the severe grades in the mountain area are comparatively infrequent and separated by long stretches of low-grade line , so that by the use of helper engines at certain strategic points longer and heavier trains can be hauled than are feasible in western trunk line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and simple mainline hauls west of the gateways through open and uncongested country , where mainline traffic is heavy , where there are few , if any , complicated terminals , and where operating costs can be reduced by the use of facilities , motive power , and operating methods suited to the situation . The principal transcontinental traffic eastbound consists of fruits , vegetables , canned goods , forest products , metals , wool and live- stock . whereas that westbound consists of manufactured goods from Chicago and St. Louis and points in the industrial east . The eastbound is three or four times as heavy as the westbound traffic .
