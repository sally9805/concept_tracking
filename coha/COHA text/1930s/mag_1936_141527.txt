" For about three and a half centuries print-makers had been producing popular-priced prints in unlimited editions . About the middle of the last century a new trend began to emerge , the tendency to make prints more precious and expensive . The artist printed fewer and fewer proofs , limiting the total to from 25 to 100 and then destroyed the plate . And he charged correspondingly more for each proof because they were so few . Furthermore about 65 years ago it became customary for the artist to sign each print in pencil , no doubt to show that he approved of its quality . . . . <P> " None of the Old Masters issued prints limited to 100 proofs and signed in pencil . One never finds a Rembrandt etching , or a print by Drer , Mantegna , Van Dyck , Goya , Turner , Delacroix or Daumier so signed and limited . These masters or their dealers printed impressions as long as people wanted them . . . . " <P> With this introduction an organization known as the American Artists Group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at low prices to the U. S. public . Starting rather timidly last year with traveling exhibitions of prints and a show of Christmas cards designed by well-known artists and selling for 5-25 apiece ( TIME , Sept. 16 , 1935 ) , the Artists Group last week was able to hang on the walls of Manhattan 's Weyhe Gallery a collection of 53 original etchings , lithographs , woodcuts . Unsigned , unlimited , each one was priced at $2.75 . <P> For that sum a purchaser had his choice of such particular bargains as two fine nudes by Emil Ganso , a crowded Coney Island beach scene by Reginald Marsh , a languorous Siamese cat by Agnes Tait , a lithograph of wild horses by last year 's PWA discovery , Frank Mechau Jr. , a group of bulbous people looking at other strange fish in an aquarium window by Mabel Dwight , a fine winter landscape by Ernest Fiene . <P> At the same time last week another artists ' group , Living American Art , Inc. announced that for $5 apiece it was prepared to sell collotype* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annually by a jury composed of Artists Louis Bouche , Adolf Dehn , Alexander Brook , Hughes Mearnes . A small royalty will be paid to the artist on the sale of each print . Living American Art expects to do more than merely sell good reproductions at reasonable prices . A special shipping case has been designed in which twelve prints can be fitted without injury . Any reputable school in the U. S. may receive a case of prints four times a year to serve as a traveling art show , at no other expense than a promise to buy at least one $5 print from each exhibition . <P> *A color process too delicate for mass reproduction , in which thin sheets of gelatin instead of metal plates are used for printing .
