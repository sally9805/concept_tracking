Last week came the turn of Henry Morgenthau , gentleman farmer , now Secretary of the Treasury , to go up Capitol Hill to explain to an inquisitive if not skeptical Congress the Administration 's money plans . Having already announced that the Administration seeks no new taxes ( except on Government salaries and securities ) , Mr. Morgenthau had to get Congress : <P> 1 ) To extend the President 's power to fix the value of the dollar anywhere between 50 and 60 oldstyle ( present value 59-06 . <P> 2 ) To extend the life of the $2,000,000,000 Exchange Stabilization Fund , created from the paper profit of the original devaluation in 1934 . <P> 3 ) To raise the legal limit of the U. S. debt from $45,000,000,000 , which it is to reach in 16 months , to $50,000,000,000 . ( The debt on March i : $39,915,000.000 ) . <P> First before a House committee , then before Senators , Mr. Morgenthau was on the defensive from the outset . The reason for renewing both the President 's power of dollar devaluation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. S. business if European currencies go to pot , but Mr. Morgenthau had solemnly to assure the House that the Administration had , at this time , no idea of further devaluation ; that the Fund had not and never would be used to finance foreign purchases of arms in the U. S. <P> House members were fairly polite to the Secretary . Crusty old Democrat Carter Glass produced a bluish bundle wrapped in rubber bands . " That bundle , " he warned , " is German marks which once were worth $46,000 and they are not worth wiping your nose on now . " <P> Mr. Morgenthau said : " If I was sure all the principal trading nations of the world could get together to stabilize currency , I would not ask this extension . " <P> Senator Glass : " What emergency would require further degradation of the dollar ? " <P> Mr. Morgenthau : " I do n't understand you . You say ' degradation . ' " <P> Senator Glass : " You know perfectly well what I mean . " <P> All this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painful than the discussion of raising the debt limit . Loyal as he is to Franklin Roosevelt , Henry Morgenthau would like by this time to see the end of the Government 's perennial deficit and mounting debt . Before the House committee he declared his belief that a $50,000,000,000 debt would be perfectly safe . Before the Senate committee he cited the continued demand for U. S. bonds as proof that the Federal credit has not been undermined . Senator Glass rasped , " You have maneuvered the damn thing to where they have to take your securities to protect the ones they have already ! "
