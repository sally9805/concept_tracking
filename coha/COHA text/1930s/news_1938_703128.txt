txt Letters to The Times Spending in Order to Save Naval Appropriation Seen as Insurance Against Larger Tribute Payments TO THE EDITOR Or THE NEW YORK TIMES : Dr. Charles Austin Beard is quoted as having said : " The idea of Germany or Italy or Japan sending a fleet of battleships convoying 500,000 soldiers across the seas in majestic array Is simply fantastic . " . But is it ? Of course , as a man of Dr. Beard 's intelligence must know , no invading army would be sent to our shores as long as our defending fleet was intact and dangerous . But after a superior fleet or fleets had destroyed or bottled up our own battleships in some harbor , the cities of our long coastline and the vital Panama Canal would be exposed to attack . Then , after our naval personnel had put up the gallant fight that is expected of them and which they can be relied upon to do and had gone to their deaths as a result of our niggardliness in. providing a naval strength competent to cope with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , indeed , would the convoying of an army of 500,000 or 1,000,000 or any number of soldiers required for invasion be readily brought to our shores and find ample choice of landing places . Then we should see the humiliating spectacle of our coast cities put under tribute with the threat of bombardment if we tailed to pay what was demanded . And that ransom would far exceed the money required to build and maintain for years a naval force of sufficient power to defend itself and our long coastline against potential enemies ; a naval force large enough to meet a hostile fleet at sca before it reaches our shores and one that could engage such an enemy with a prospect of success . Regardless of a difference of opinion as to the battleship 's value , the fact remains that foreign nations place their reliance upon them , and are still building them . If we fail to meet this program so long as it continues , we lay ourselves open to attack and may easily find ourselves in the same disastrous predicament as existed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered to decay owing to the short-sightedness of Congress . Those who urge the passage of the Naval Appropriation Bill are not asking for the building of a fleet for aggression . They are asking for a force competent to ward off any hostile fleet and prevent the very transportation of such an invading army as Dr. Beard refers to . Our present fleet might protect either the Atlantic or the Pacific Coast against one foreign power whose naval strength does not surpass our own . It could not protect both coasts nor even one if two or more of such foreign powers " ganged up " on us . And who can safely predict that this will not occur ? Shall this rich and powerful nation of ours send its officers and men of the fleet to certain defeat and death in - the event of war , with no chance ' of their sacrifice availing anything ? F. PARKER LEWIS . New Haven , Conn. , Feb. 11 , 1938 . Some Jerseyites Not Amused To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your editorial " Jersey Farce " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything but entertainment in the Hudson County ballot situation and the attitude of the Legislature and Governor Moore . The spectacle of the Chief Executive of New Jersey refusing to lend even moral support to the purposes of the Young Assembly committee , the first of which is to examine public records , is not funny ; it is ghastly . When the procedure is likely to involve the political and personal integrity of the Chief Executive and eventually may challenge the legality of his election , the situation is as remote from farce as the themes of Shakespeare 's major tragedies . The sanctity of the ballot is not a mere phrase to many of us in New Jersey . To have seen it destroyed as it certainly has been in Hudson County strikes us as a serious and solemn fact . That Republican Senators in the New Jersey Legislature can become part of what is clearly a conspiracy to prevent , delay or impede an investigation into election conditions in Hudson County is not surprising to those of us who have all but despaired of returning the State to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared in a petition filed with the Supreme Court that at least 55,000 votes were fraudulently cast by the Hague Democratic organization in behalf of Governor Moore in the November election . This is either extravagant nonsense or a breath-taking truth . The poll books in the vaults of the Hudson County Board of Elections , guarded by what is nothing less than an armed rebellion by the county Police Departments against the highest law-making body in the State , will prove either one or the other .

That New Yorkese " R " To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : May I put my , oar into the discussion concerning the use of the letter " r " in the spoken New Yorkese ? Specifically I want to disagree with some of the conclusions of Dermot Cavanagh . Coming to New York from up-State I was amazed and delighted at the way the New Yorker. juggled the " r " in and out of his conversation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full flower of this trick in Westchester County . Soon after arriving , while taking a hike along the old aqueduct above Yonkers I inquired my way of a tattered youngster . The sheer artistry with which the lad kept the magic letter darting in and out from where it belonged to where it did n't was such a joy that I lingered , as long as I decently. could . Later , while in a store in New Rochelle , a grand dame asked for a raihhaw for her bawth house . By what vocal gymnastic she accomplished a word half made up of " r 's " and missed every one of them , I ca n't say , but she did it . . Oddly , I can dispute Mr. Cavanagh on his sentence " The earl burned the oil " from real experience . It would be " The oil boined the erl . " It . so happens that in my former company our purchasing agent was named Earle , " and it chanced that oil . was one of the items we sold . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked for " oil " was one who had something to offer our buyer , whereas he who wanted to see our " erl " must be treated with the consideration " due a possible customer . F.

On the Matter of Tipping Rewards to Waiters , It Is Held , Should Be Voluntary and Based on Service To Tat Eorros. or THE NEW YORK Maw : The subject of tipping in restaurants is again being discussed , even Mrs. Roosevelt having been quoted as opposed to it . I am in no way associated with the dispensing or serving of foods , being merely a frequent guest of the better-class restaurants , some of which  --  and the list seems to be growing  --  call attention to their rule that waiters are not permitted to accept tips , under threat of dismissal , and the guest is advised that " 10 per cent for service has been added to the check . " By what right does the proprietor of a restaurant appoint himself judge of whether you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiter , whether that waiter gives you adequate service or not ? Suppose on a hot Summer day you want to take at noon simply a bowl of milk and crackers , and loiter over its consumption , have a smoke for another ten minutes or more  --  whose business is that but your own ? But under the compulsory tipping system the waiter certainly does not beam a welcome to you when his share of your bill is infinitesimal . The added 10 per cent also makes the waiter a high-pressure salesman who tries to make you eat more than you want and get through with it in haste so as to make room for another customer . Why is it not my right to order what I like and tip my waiter for what I know he has done for me ? to give him if I please a quarter - tip for my bowl of milk and crackers ? Or , if he is slow , rude or in any way inefficient or distasteful to me , why ca n't I discipline him by giving a very small tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said on this subject before such a decision is made such as Mr. Whalen is quoted in THE TIMES as considering for the World 's Fair restaurants . ARTHUR E. FAIRCHILD . New York , Feb. 11 , 1938 . Psychiatrists and the State To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I was particularly interested in Commissioner MacCormick 's letter in THE TIMES and his interest in saying that psychiatric examinations should be made by city or State psychiatrists . I am also interested to see that there is a general tendency in this direction . But as Montaigne said , " Man is a very fickle being , " and it seems that this is true , for though some officials believe that city and State psychiatrists should be given a more responsible role , the Feld-Hamilton Career Bill lately completed in New York State has seen fit to advance many careers but has decided to dwarf the careers of psychiatrists of the Department of Correction by lowering their salaries until they are in fact the lowest paid of all psychiatrists in institutional and private practice . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychiatrists they are most acquainted with the psychiatric aspects of crime . ARTHUR N. FOXE , M. D. Comstock , N. Y. , Feb. 10 , 1938 . Our Policy in the Far East To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In his column Arthur Krock referred recently to " the deep impression " in. the United States that " British policy is always subtly selfish and British diplomacy is always superior to our own . " I wonder what the British think about this . For years they played up to the Japanese and in 1932 somewhat ostentatiously dissociated ' themselves from Mr. Stimson 's policy in regard to Manchuria . Upon whom do the Japanese vent their indignation in 1937 ? Upon the United States ? Not at ail . It is the British who are blamed for the attitude and resistance of China . Our protests against this or that incident have been received in Tokyo in good temper . Granted that we are not yet out of the woods , it is time that the skillful and realistic policy of the State Department in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E. SCHMITT .

Children and Firearms To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In answer to Joseph Lewis 's letter In today 's ' issue , I should like to ask whether warnings from teachers about the handling of firearms would do much good as long as children are being given toy pistols to play with ? It seems to me that the only ones that really can do anything about this tragic evil are the parents . If peace-loving parents would refuse to give children war and crime inciting toys , the first step would have been made toward a safer world for all of us . ZARSA . New York , Feb. 5 ; 1938 .
