The Academy of Political Science , a prosperous group of U. S. businessmen , professors and economists at whose gatherings white ties are more in evidence than Windsor bows , made large headlines in 1933 when George Bernard Shaw delivered a saucy socialistic speech under its auspices at Manhattan 's Metropolitan Opera House . Last week the Academy , gathered for its 57th annual meeting at Manhattan 's Astor Hotel , heard an equally newsmaking speech , neither saucy nor socialistic , by U. S. Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr . <P> Perhaps because of the innate conservatism which moves his light-hearted Hyde Park neighbor Franklin Roosevelt to call him " Sad Henry " or " Henry the Morgue , " Secretary Morgenthau has long been encouraging the same bridge between the New Deal and U. S. Business which the President was last week trying to throw up in Washington ( see col. 1 ) . Since an excellent evidence of the sincerity of Franklin Roosevelt 's intentions would be to have Henry Morgenthau publicly advocate a rapprochement with the same fervor he is understood to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear Mr. Morgenthau on " The Federal Budget . " <P> Before Mr. Morgenthau , seated at the banquet 's head table next to Morgan Partner Thomas W. Lament , got a chance to advocate anything at all , he had the chance to hear two speeches ably marshaling the grievances of Business . As alert as a college debater , the Secretary thoughtfully pursed his lips while Virginia 's Senator Harry F. Byrd ( " We might carry out the Democratic platform " ) and Morgan Partner S. Parker Gilbert ( " Nothing would accomplish more . . . than the repeal of the undistributed profits tax " ) proceeded to needle the New Deal 's fiscal policy . <P> As Secretary Morgenthau got to his feet for his rebuttal , the applause was more polite than enthusiastic . It was to come far more spontaneously as , adjusting his pince-nez and reading carefully from manuscript , the Secretary presented on every fiscal front positions which , while for the most part they were neither novel nor complete , were nonetheless the most satisfying public words Business has heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " two years ago . <P> Budget . " We deliberately used an unbalanced Federal budget during the past four years to meet a great emergency . That policy has succeeded . The emergency that we faced in 1933 no longer exists . I am fully aware that many of our problems remain unsolved . ... I am further aware that some persons contend that another great spending program is desirable to ward off the risk of another great business depression . . . . But ... I have reached the firm conviction that the domestic problems which face us today are essentially different from those which faced us four years ago . Many measures are required for their solution . One of these measures ... in the present juncture is a determined movement toward a balanced budget . " <P> Deficit . " Our total receipts for this year were estimated in the President 's budget summation of Oct. 19 at about $6,650,000,000 , and our total net expenditures at about $7,345,000,000 , leaving an estimated net deficit of $695,000,000.           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
