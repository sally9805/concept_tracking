In Montpellier , France toward the close of the 13th Century was born one Roch , son of the town 's wealthy governor . Orphaned , Roch gave away his fortune , set out for Rome as a mendicant pilgrim . In town after town on the way , plagues miraculously disappeared upon his advent . But in Piacenza he fell ill himself , was expelled to a forest where he would have died save for the devoted ministrations of a dog . Roch died in his 30s , was identified by a red cross which , according to tradition , had been on his breast at birth . Roman Catholics came to believe God had given Roch the power of healing the plague-stricken , and he was canonized even before the city of Constance was delivered from cholera in 1414 by prayers for his intercession .

Business activities ceased , citizens barred themselves indoors , while carts rumbled off with the dead , and hydrants gushed to rid the town of its foulness . Among the devout who tolled their church bells and prayed for deliverance were the Catholics of St. Michael 's parish on the South Side , who addressed their supplications to St. Roch and the Blessed Virgin , vowing that if they were spared they would devote a day to the two every year forever. * Not a single parishioner of St. Michael 's was stricken then or in the second plague which swept Pittsburgh in 1853 <P> Last week on the South Side , now a congested mill district , for the 88th time solemn high mass was celebrated in St. Michael 's for hundreds of Catholics , some of them sons and grandsons of those delivered from the plague , some of them old parishioners who traveled hundreds of miles for the event . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containing a bit of one of St. Roch 's bones . <P> <P> * Because the feast of St. Roch falls within the octave-eight-day observance-of the feast of the Assumption of the Virgin ( Aug. 15 ) , the two can be conveniently celebrated together .
