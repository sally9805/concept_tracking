txt The President 's silver proclamation is not of the high importance which some ** impute to it . The " supplementary agreement " of July 22 at the London Economic Conference , between delegates of the largest silver-producing and silver-consuming countries , plainly foreshadowed it . That agreement , which had to be approved by the several governments before going into force , has thus far been ratified only by India and by the United States , President ROOSEVELT invoking the powers conferred on him by our so-called Inflation Act . The governments of Australia , Canada , Mexico , Peru , China and Spain have not yet acted , but are expected to do so . The President 's proclamation need therefore cause no great surprise . His proposals for governmental purchase and coinage of silver will make little impression on the currency . All of the 24,421,410 ounces which by the London agreement were to be " absorbed " by the United States are to be the product of domestic mines The President stipulates that half of the silver tendered shall be retained by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 per cent seigniorage . " The rest will be coined at the established ratio , and turned over in dollars in full payment for the silver tendered . This will mean only some $15,700,000 addition to our currency . Since the home producers get the " coinageparity " of $1.29 per ounce for only half of the silver delivered , the Government will pay them 64 ' cents per ounce for all of their deliveries , as against Thursday 's market price of 43 cents . The result will be a small increase of the American money supply , payment to home silver miners of a price .50 per cent above the market , and the locking up in the Treasury 's vaults of 12,210,000 ounces of idle silver bullion . The last-named consequence will duplicate the heaping up of idle bullion , under the famous Silver-Purchase Act of 1890 , which made trouble enough afterward for the Treasury . But the present plan of the Administration proposes annual " silver purchases " during only four years . It does not , like the statute of 1890 , impose on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it does not , as that mischievous legislation did , provide for purchase by our Government , up to the prescribed annual sum , of silver from anywhere in the world . On the other hand , it resembles the law of 1890 in being an uneconomic experiment , in substance a political " sop " to the silver-mining States . Since the purpose of the present experiment is avowedly to raise the price of silver , the longer sequel on the silver market should be interesting . Yesterday 's New York market responded by the not at all sensational rise of 11 ; 1 cents per ounce , to 4411 cents , as against the Government 's offered price of 64ii . This is less enthusiastic than the market 's response in 1890 , when silver rose 17 cents in the month after the Silver-Purchase Law 's enactment , nearly reaching " coinage parity . " But in the next three months the price fell 23 cents , and three years later it sold 56 cents an ounce below the high price of 1890 . What had happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production during the three years following 1889 , and increase of 31 per cent in the world 's silver output after 1890 . When that ill-fated Silver-Purchase Bill was contrived in 1889 , President HARRisoN begged off from explanation of it in his annual message . Apparently , he could not understand it . But he added : " At a later day I may com " municate further with Congress upon " this subject . " He did so . In his ; annual message , one year later , he remarked that " the recent depreciation " in price of silver has been observed " with regret . "
