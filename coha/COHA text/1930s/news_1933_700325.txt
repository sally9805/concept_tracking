txt Dr. Shirley W. Wynne , Health Commissioner , announced yesterday the result of analyses of twentyfive samples of whisky from retail stores and public drinking places in Manhattan , the Bronx and Brooklyn . Thirteen samples of whisky bottled in bond , legally required to be straight whisky at least four years old , were found to be as labeled . This is the whisky which costs $5.50 a quart and up . It is the lowest price , the commissioner said , at which a drinker may be sure that he is drinking whisky . All the remaining twelve samples representing whisky which is sold for $3 and $3.50 a quart , were found to be composed , according to the commissioner , " of less whisky than any self-respecting bootlegger would put in a blend , together with alcohol , rye flavoring , coloring matter and water . " All the commissioner could find to say in favor of these repeal blends was that the alcohol was of undoubted purity and that as a liquor the mixture was not harmful ; but he refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was " ridiculous to offer it to the public at such prices when it could be made for 50 cents a quart . " Commissioner Wynne said he had not yet taken any samples of gin , assuming that some of it was synthetic and also , in view of the availability of pure alcohol , assuming it was sound . What occupied him , he said , was the verification of the public suspicion that repeal had merely ushered the drinking public out of the era of " bathtub gin " into an era of " bathtub whisky . " He said he would not reveal the names of the brands at present because he was now convinced the abuse of the whisky label was so widespread that none should be named until a more complete list could be compiled . He laid the situation before a conference at his office in the Health Department yesterday to which he had invited Federal and State liquor control authorities ' , and representatives of the distillers to consider a revision of the New York City Sanitary Code which would require labels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle . When Commissioner Wynne declared the blends now offered to the public at $3 and up per quart were " cut " eight or ten ways , objection was made by Dr. James M. Doran , who recently resigned as Federal Industrial Alcohol Commissioner to become head of the National Distillers Institute . Dr. Doran said the word " cut " came from bootleg practices when whisky was stretched with questionable alcohol , whereas distillers were now using grain distillates which had never been fouled with denaturants and were expanding the concentrated old whiskies to meet the widespread demand . Edward P. Mulrooney , chairman of the New York State Alcoholic Beverage Control Board , agreed with Commissioner Wynne , however , that if the public was to be asked to consume a great deal of alcohol , however pure , it should not be asked to pay whisky prices . Dr. Doran , attended by T. P. Walker , H. Jacobi and George R. Benann , all representing the distillers institute , then proposed to submit a whisky label by Thursday to meet the New York criticism . Fixes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labels should show the make-up of a so-called whisky in proportions of aged-in-the-wood whisky of each age used , new whisky and how new , added spirits , coloring matter , water and the proof-strength of the whole mixture . Mr. Mulrooney said he was in favor of having bottles labeled so that the consumer would know what he was buying and drinking . Dr. Doran conceded that under the present Federal labeling regulations there was no way the consumer could know this . He pointed out , however , that three-quarters of all the whisky consumed in this country for decades before prohibition had been blended and flavored for the reason that many drinkers did not find aged straight whiskies as palatable or as easy to assimilate because the fusel oils and other flavors that accompanied the straight distillation of rye whisky gave them acid stomachs or " hang-overs " when consumed in any quantity . The Federal liquor control authorities were not represented at the conference yesterday although invitations had been telegraphed to Washington on Friday to Joseph H. Choate Jr. , director of the Federal Alcohol Control Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Industrial Alcohol . Commissioner Wynne said he had not heard from them but that he hoped to establish communication and enlist Federal cooperation . " It is all very well for New York City to prescribe a statement of the contents of whisky labels , " he said , " but the only practical way to insure the contents of the bottles is to exercise a supervision where they are filled , and that is a Fed-1 eral matter . " Analysis Is Difficult . He said it was virtually impossible to analyze whisky chemically into its components in terms of aged whisky , as well as added alcohol , whether from grain , molasses or industrial sources . He said the best that could be done was to test for acids , solids , and various characteristic components of rye distillates and compare the results with experience tables established before prohibition . The active cooperation of thel Federal authorities as well as of the distillers interested in an honest label would be necessary , accordingl to Commissioner Wynne , if the public were to be reliably assured as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this to the meeting of the Board of Health which is scheduled at 2 P. M. today to consider an amendment to the municipal sanitary code prescribing a supplemental label for all liquor sold in this city . It is considered likely that action will be deferred pending the label report of the distillers on Thursday and communication with the Federal authorities . In a talk broadcast over station WEAF after the conference yesterday , Dr. Wynne said : " Now that prohibition has been repealed it is important that the public be protected against unscrupulous distillers who , in their anxiety to meet the demand for liquor and to make a profit for themselves , are selling whisky under names which mean nothing to the public and convey no information as to the quality of the whiskies . " In illustration , he said that nine of the twelve samples which had been found to be a mixture of a small amount of whisky and a great deal of alcohol , coloring and water , had been labeled " For Medicinal Use . " The legal authority under which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code of the city which provides in part : " No person shall have , sell or offer for sale in the City of New York any food which is adulterated or misbranded . The term food as here used shall include every article of food and every beverage used by man , and all confectionery. "
