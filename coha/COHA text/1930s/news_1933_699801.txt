txt " Enlightened cooperation " is the method essential for the success of the industrial coordination plans now being considered in Congress . Bernard M. Baruch , head of the War Industries Board during the World War , declared in an address on " Economic Planning and Government Control " before the Brookings Institute here . Mr. Baruch laid down three tenets for enforcement of industrial coordination : " effective and self-directed cooperation " within industry itself , " mobilization of public opinion , " and " distinct and adequate authority " for the coordinating body , backed by the power of the government . Furthermore , he said that since the purpose of the Industrial Act as well as of the Farm Bill is to raise prices , " this process is certain to raise American costs even further above world costs , and to require additional protection against importations . Says Inconsistencies Can Be Ironed Out " All this struggle . " he continued , " suggests inconsistency in domestic policy with any plan to lower tariffs in world economic conference . But that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scant remaining business , cost and price have become such factors that , in the unstable fringes which surround each industry , a few operators have taken the last dangerous step in economic retrogression  --  the attainment of low costs by the degradation of labor standards , " Mr. Baruch said in reviewing the causes for the present demands for regulation of production . ? ? bow costs secured in this way create an unbearable competitive disadvantage to companies of large vision and a sense of social obligation . These companies have no defense save to follow suit  --  thus a whole industrial and labor group is forced to drop to a lower step , from which new level there seems no escape from a repetition of downward scaling . " Says Dieipline Must Exist Referring to his own experiences in control of industry during the War years , Mr. Baruch said : " While we agree fully that industry must voluntarily accept and ask for coordination , and that any appearance of dictatorship must be avoided , the power of discipline must exist . " The necessity for simplicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Baruch . " In certainly a majority of trades the same rule for hours and wages is applicable , " he said . " The quickest method is to bring uniform cases to swift action by a blanket rule nod then to deal with the exceptions . A general rule applicable to 75% of industry could be worked out very promptly by a conference of leaders in industry and labor . " The exceptional cases should be presented by Trade Associations to whatever federal administration agency as is named . " he declared . " A competent federal administration must be set up promptly . It should be composed of a practical and disinterested specialist for each principal industrial grouping . " Since the depression is the common enemy of all , public opinion must be marshalled behind those producers cooperating with the recovery movement , Mr. Baruch asserted . " If it is commonly understood that those who are cooperating are soldiers against the common enemy within , and those who omit to act are on the other side , there will be little hanging back . The insignia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a necessity in business . This method was used with success in 1918 , " he said . Will Not Need to Police Industry The government will not need to police industry against recalcitrants since " industries will attend to that in their own protection , " Mr. Baruch declared . " The first step against the unwilling should be persuasion or action by the trade associations themselves with government support , but in the end there will be a residue of cases that must be handled by a more severe use of a licensing system . " Execution of the industry act will require " constructive , tactful understanding and courageous leadership , " but will involve " no such organization and red tape and administration as seems to be conjectured , " Mr. Baruch said . " It is indispensable to increase the mass purchasing . Slower to put people back to work . In that phrase lies the beginning and the end of all economic plans , and the bent base for human happiness , " he declared .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
