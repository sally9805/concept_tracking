HAVE you ever hocked your wife 's engagement ring ? Even though the ring may have cost only forty-five dollars , as Mrs. Terry 's did , pawning it still carries a shame and self-reproach that no amount of later success can erase from your ? memory . You see , I had bought that little ring with savings from meager baseball salaries and , when I married her , I made glowing promises that only an eighteenyear-old groom can fashion . Being very young , too , she believed my promises of gold and glory in baseball , and believed them with a sublime faith that amazed even me . Well , there we were , in a cafeteria at Shreveport , Louisiana , with our last cent invested in a much-needed breakfast . I had two weeks in which to justify my demand for a pay rise from $140 to $155 a month , plus ton dollars for my wife 's expenses from New Orleans , where we had wintered after our honeymoon . Since the ball club would foot my training-camp expenses , the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1 newspapers and magazines as " What'sin-it-for-me Terry .

This biograpliieal treatise is in no sense an Areopagitiea. to use an old baseball term , for there is nothing to be defended .

Once in a while an ornery paragraph gets under my skin , but the next day 's hall game crowds out the irritation . Besides , technical and financial success has given most of the critical heckling a boomerang twist , as the following chain of incidents will indicate . I developed an even greater respect for money after refusing to report to Little Rock in the spring of 1018 . The steady job I finally landed paid 818.50 a week for making storage batteries . But it was eighteen-fifty more than nothing at all , and there was plenty of room for advancement . Because it was impossible to get along on that salary , I was constantly in a financial hole and seeking to climb out by the simple process of working like a truck horse . I learned everything there was to be learned in that shop about building a storage batten . The investment paid dividends some months later when the company begun to give cash bonuses for heavy output @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production as one man can , and eventually I collected enough extra dough to keep my head above water . I might have been building storage batteries to this day if the owner 's son had n't tried to tell me how to run my work and division . After my long night-and-day toil . I felt that there was n't much he could tell me about that shop , especially coming from a front office . I quit . I look a job with an oil company and I 've worked with them for nineteen years . The oil company had baseball teams , and it took them no time to ferret me out for the sole purpose of helping the cause on Saturdays and Sundays . In the summer of 1921 I took a two-weeks vacation and cleared 8600 playing semipro ball with my own team . That was when Kid Elberfeld , manager of the Little Rock club , to which I had refused to report , decided that I was worth following up . And so he got in touch with John J. McGraw , who bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Story of a Holdout N OW , reporting to the Giants was considerably better than going to Little Rock as a castoff . McGraw had struck the pennant mother lode again , and there was no telling how far I might go from this springboard . The water was deep and , as in the ease of the storage-battery job , there was plenty of room for advancement . And so I tackled league baseball again . My first meeting with John J. McGraw came in the old Peabody Hotel , Memphis , when I barged into the wrong room . He was dressed in a suit of long winter underwear and he looked like one of these bull-shaped legendary gnomes . The grin on my face must have annoyed him . " What do you want ? " he barked . " Mr. Tierney told me to come up . " " Well , you go into the next room and tell Mr. Tierney that I 'd like a little privacy ! " Four years later the old Peabody Hotel bad been replaced by a new one , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a home and a family and a degree of security that had come from hustling for two years at Toledo , where the Giants had sent me , and winding up as manager ; and from hustling on the Giants through the pennant-winning year of 1924 and the " almost " victorious year , 1925 . Playing 133 games in this latter year , mostly as a first baseman , I had batted .319 , driven in seventy runs , and ranked with the ' best first-sackers of the year defensively , according to the records . That , to my way of figuring , justified a demand for a thousand dollars more than the Giants offered . When they refused to tilt their offer at . all , I had remained with the oil company in Memphis . I built a gas station on a good spot and was pumping 81100 worth of gas and oil a month . The station is still there , pumping plenty . Naturally , I would have compromised , but there was no attempt on the part of McGraw to meet me part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Sarasota , Florida , for training , McGraw got hot under the collar , as any manager might . Then he began a campaign to bring me into line , to cut me down to what be thought was my size . At various times through that holdout period , I learned through the news dispatches relayed from Now York that Bill Terry was what is known as an " old rookie . " I learned that I was slow of foot and head , that I could not go to my left and had to play closer to the hag , thus making it necessary to bring Frisch over farther to his left and weaken double-play strategy , and that I had batted over my head in 1925 . I also learned , through reading these dispatches , that the Giants would not suffer if I decided to pull a Mike Donlin and hold out for the entire year ! These appraisals appeared in the newspapers as regular stories and as quotations of McGraw , but McGraw did n't write the stories , nor did he pay for space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball writers as channels through which be could let the world in general , and me in particular , know that Terry did not rate , as long as Terry persisted in demanding more money . I knew that McGraw did n't believe these appraisals and I never could understand why the baseball writers crawled far out on a limb so willingly . If McGraw 's obviously strategic statements carried more weight than my full season of success , then what , I asked myself , is the press box for ? Why did writers spend so many days at ball games if only to believe a biased analysis of a player whom they had watched all year ? When the barnstorming Giants reached Memphis , I went to the new Peabody Hotel to talk with McGraw . I did n't barge into his room this time . I telephoned , and received the gruff reply : " If you want to sign a contract , see Branniek ; he has them ! " And the manager hung up . I went back to the gas station and pumped more gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W EN the 1926 season opened , I was still at the as station . Ten days passed and I was automatically suspended from . baseball . I would have been pumping gas there yet , if Billy Southworth , the Giant outfielder and secret emissary of McGraw , had n't telephoned for me to hurry north and join the club . " But the dough ? " I protested . " You 'll get a raise . The Old Man said so . Meet us in I responded with a will , signed a contract calling for $500 more than the club had offered , and was reinstated by Judge Landis . Naturally , McGraw didn't. like handing out a raise to a stubborn young player , and he showed it . He would n't let rim play , and most of my batting was done as a pinch hitter . Beyond a few weeks in the outfield when Pep Young was sick , I did n't even earn my 8500 raise . I never got a chance to work into playing condition and my batting average for that year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December when I received a two-year contract for the same salary . But imagine the club 's surprise when I mailed the contract back and asked for a one-year document . The Giants obliged and I returned it signed . As soon as it had reached the New York office , McGraw announced that George Kelly had been traded to Cincinnati for Edd Roush , an outfielder , and that Bill Terry would be the regular first baseman of the Giants . Now , all I could think about was the low appraisal of Terry 's value as a ball player published the year before . I was too slow , could n't go to my left , was getting old , and so on , and the same writers who had written this tripe had to write now that I was the regular first . baseman , worthy successor to the great George Kelly . one-time Giant hero . Here was Lesson No. 2 . The first was one of economic security , learned in the Shreveport cafeteria . The second came out of that 1926 business deal . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a public trust by misinforming millions of baseball fans , intentionally or otherwise , for the sole purpose of enhancing the ball club 's position in a salary discussion . Mind you , I had no feeling against any individual , for I did n't know who had written the stories relayed to Memphis , and eared less . I had no ill-feeling for McGraw . He was employed by the ball club to protect its interest and principal . I was impressed deeply by the fact that the same experienced gamewatchers and player analysts who had ash-canned me the year before were now obliged to herald me as the natural successor to the great George Kelly . It did n't make sense , and it was reduced to nonsense as the years piled up . When the 1927 season opened , I put aside everything but thoughts of baseball . A lot of ground had to be covered , and most of it was around first base , I settled down to the job of disproving every one of those derogatory statements . I proved that I could go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Hornsby that year , could play any spot he chose , that I was anything but slow upstairs and down , and that I could match the hitting pace of any batter on the Giants . Perennial Thorn T WOgood years seemed fairly convincing to me , but not to the ball club , and I was obliged to hold out . I wanted more money and a two-year contract . McGraw refused both , but finally agreed on the salary rise , and signed me for a year . It was very costly , because I batted .372 for 150 games and , instead of being signed for the next year , became a. financial problem . Once more I asked for a two-year contract with a 85000 tilt in wages . I got the tilt , but only a one-year contract . During the next year , 1930 , I put together the greatest season of my life . Everything I hit seemed to land safe , and here were 254 of them to tie he league record . My batting average of . ? 01 led all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the annual argument took place . Once again I asked for a two-year agreement and failed to get it , but I received a rise of 37000 in salary . McGraw 's refusal to sign me for two or three years had cost the club S12,000 , and the end was not yet . By that time I was compared in the press with all the great first basemen . Analytical stories stated that I could give Hal Chase an even fight for top honors . Baseball writers were constantly answering the fan query : " Who is better , Gehrig or Terry , Terry or Sisler ? " and so on . Big Shoes to Fill W EN I failed to lead the elague in batting for 1931 by a matter of .0002 , McGraw slashed my salary 55000 , and I was obliged to remain on the oil job until after spring training had started .

" Listen , " he greeted , " suppose you go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right-handed pitcher I want , I 'll okay the deal right now ! " He mentioned a right-handed pitcher who , in the past two years , had won fourteen games and lost twenty . " Make your own deals , " I replied . " I get enough blame just for playing first base . " Compare this mood with the one reflected by the following conversation two months later . The Giants were in seventh place . It was the eighth year of pennant futility for McGraw . Never before had he gone more than five years without a championship . " Stand with your back to the door , " he said , after calling me into his office at the Polo Grounds . " I do n't want to close the door , and I do n't want anybody to hear what we are saying . " I stood as directed and listened . " I 'm retiring from this job , " he said , with no dramatics whatever . " If you want it , you can have it . Now , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and think it over . " I took time enough to draw a deep breath , and then gave him my answer : " I 'll take it ! " Perhaps I should havepaused to realize that I was succeeding a man and personality who had been more than a manager in Now York City . He had been Baseball . He was a tradition to tens of thousands of fans , young and old . The Giants meant McGraw ; McGraw was the Giants . It was ( Continued on Page 72 ) place !

" Haw , it 's lik the Jewel Song from Frowst or any o ' those Eyetrilian operas ! " he exulted as he boarded the Ineheliffe Castle and lurched to his room . He set . the model on the dresser and considered it gloatingly . " Too for the red port lieht , which will certainly be the ruby , and then for the green emerald to starboard . Ier ? Ah , horrors ! " For lie saw that the model had no port and starboard lights , and in that instant realized that she 'd never had them ! From the dim depths of his memory came a voice  --  Mr. Levy 's voice  --  as he 'd heard it that moonlit night in Semarang. " 1 rope ' e . . . bought them little two-volt flarshlight bulbs , " Mr. Levy was saving . " . ' e arsked me to ' alp ' im wire up that scale model of the ship ' e 's been building . . . .

I did n't stop to figure these angles because I have always worked a job on the basis of deliver or step down . I followed that precept at Shreveport . I followed it in the battery shop when front-office interference threatened my efficiency and income . I ate a few slices of humble pie here and there with the Giants , but when I delivered the goods , I demanded a just reward for my work and got it . And that was all I planned to do as manager . I did n't set myself up as another John J. McGraw , nor did I plan to follow his methods in any particular , except where his method might dovetail with whatever I believed to be the best procedure at the moment . I was nothing but Bill Terry , with a profound reepect for a man like McGraw who Id cast aside his past personal dif1.i:inns and select me to handle the most important managing job that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interpretations for MeGraw 's resignation . Chief , of course , was that be would remain as manager and use me as a stooge and held mouthpiece to save himself that daily session in the dugout which he had grown to dislike after forty years . Let me say here that McGraw never once offered me a word of advice on how the team should be handled , and I have never asked the help or opinion of anyone but my own players . Another analyst actually termed the new job a form of punishment for my from stem to stern , from masthead to keel . He tapped its solid portions with his knife , explored its ventilators and funnel with his finger , and shined his torch beam into its tiny doors and portholes . But the stones were not there . His twelve pounds were lost forever and for aye ! Snatching up a bottle which might have contained whisky , and did , he drained a good quarter of it ; then , seizing the model , he kicked open the door and staggered toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinder which he had been laboring proved to be too much , and he lapsed to the deck in one of the more advanced yoga states of spiritual disembodiment .

If McGraw could n't lift it , be reasoned , no one else could . My only punishment came in losing a seven-year roommate , Stoney Jackson . The most barefaced misrepresentation , however , came with the repeated press statements that Fred Lindstrom was supposed to succeed McGraw , and that I had tunneled under to snatch it from his grasp . Thus , the statements went on to say , a terrific feud existed between Lindstrom and me . The actual facts are these : 1 had no warning whatever of the proposition which McGraw advanced in his Polo Grounds office .

That is the extent of our " hard feelings , " and there certainly never was any feed . By the end of the following year , 1933 , I was hailed as a miracle man by the press and , in consequence , the public , because I had piloted a sixth-place club into a National League pennant . This interpretation , of course , was nonsense . The Giants of Mauch-April , pennies oil a dead man 's eyes !

For an instant he was blinded by red and green fires that sparkled , blazed , smoldered and then blazed again . He removed the two objects and held them up to the light , 4 They glowed like magic coals in an alchemist 's furnace . " A-weel , ye little beauties ! " he scolded them good-naturedly . " After the trooble and expense ye 've caused me , ' t is too bad ye 're no another twenty carats larger ! But yell do ! Aye . ye 'll do !

The fact that they were called a sixth-place club by campaign prognosticators was the basis of my miracle working . These pre-season prophets failed to look upon Hubbell and Schumacher as winners of forty-two games . They failed to see greatness in Gus Mancuso , who had been a second-string catcher with the Cardinals . They could n't see young Joe Moore as a great outfielder , nor Blondy Ryan as a , practical as well as spiritual asset . On the basis of this flimsy hypothesis , you can get a better understanding of miracles . Defeating the Senators in the World Series made everything perfect and coated the world a rose-colored hue . The late Mr. Stoneham forestalled any holding out by giving me a contract for five years at the highest salary of my life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a rented residence at Crestwood , a suburb of New York . The salary , sociality of contract , and general outlook enabled me to enjoy the comforting society of my growing family more than at any Limo before . Now , it so happens that I have never brought business into my home , nor have I ever brought my home into business . They have always been separated , each free of the other . And so , 4 when one of the New York writers made a request for my unlisted telephone number at Crestwood , I refused , even though he was sports editor of his paper . It was an ordinary realrolce with it eneeerition that he get in touch with me through the ball-club offices . When lie persisted with his demand , I made my refusal all the more emphatic . Finally he appealed on the grounds that he might want to call me up for special angles and answers , feature stories , and so on , and I made the rejection correspondingly strong . Believe it or do n't , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day on , his sports pages were anti-Terry  --  not antiGiant  --  in unmistakable terms . Two of his baseball writers naturally took up the cudgel for the sake of consistency , unless there was some special insult or snub to them which I have overlooked . At . any rate , that was the beginning of what people have been pleased to call Terry 's feud with the sports writers ! There was only one other " breach " with any particular writer , and that concerned a gentleman who was devoted to an early dinner and an evening free from the cares of newspaper toil , a devotion with which I am in hearty sympathy . This young man , however , worked on a morning paper and , in order to clear things up immediately after the day 's game or practice workout , sought Giant news and managerial opinions before or during my work and ahead of his confreres . He came to me a couple of times ( luring spring training for such premature news and opinions . I refused and told him to gather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for I do not wish knowingly to be a party to the so-called exclusive story , no matter who pleads . With newspapers being sold or consolidated and sports departments being overcrowded , I am especially careful about anybody being frozen on a story . Still intent upon getting those items early , the morning-paper writer made a third effort , but he timed it poorly . He marched out on the diamond , ducking thrown and batted balls , during heavy practice . I was at second base , kneeling to see the hop on the fast ball of a young pitcher , and watching to see how some of the young hitters missed or connected . That is my job , and I do n't take it casually . When he made this same unfair requestfor premature opinions and items , I gave him an opinion that could be used nowhere but in an unexpurgated edition of his autobiography . And from that day on , his readers knew Bill Terry as a heel of the worst kind ! The Clubhouse " Revolt " Midway in the season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high hat . Then came published rumors of dissension among the Giants . When we finally blew the pennant after hay-mg a seven-game lead , the failure was interpreted as unmistakable proof that the Giants had revolted against their manager . Several bold statements of untruth were published in support of this " revolt . " Tales of clubhouse fist-fights among two or three different players and myself reached the fans when such combats never took place . Why , they actually had me roughand-tumbling with Carl Hubbell ! , Fred Fitzsimmons went a sickening number of innings without having any runs scored for him . After his third straight shutout defeat , he came into the clubhouse and tore his uniform in a rage . " Give him another to tear up , " I said to Logan , the clubhouse man . " Maybe it 'll break ( - ir luck . " But that uniform-tearing incident was twisted into a horrible tale of clubhouse furor . It was nothing but a pitcher 's nerves snapping , and I could n't blame Fitz . All of us felt deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball players know that streaks of luck , good and bad , are waiting for them , and that no one is to blame . Strange as it may seem , our losing out to the Cardinals in 1934 appeared to justify the statements that Terry was a two-by-four manager , unable to hold his players and deserving of exactly what had occurred . The hammering continued through the following year , and more writers got on the anti-Terry band wagon . I was quoted on the subject of " thirtydollar-a-week reporters , " when I never cast such aspersions on the newspaper business . There was a widely bandied story about my being invited to participate in Mel Ott Day at the Pelicans ' ball park , in New Orleans , and having replied by telegram , " What 's in it for me ? " When Rumors Made News I never made such a reply , telegraphic or otherwise . Ott himself telephoned me about the affair and said , " It 's one of those things . Bill ; if you 're too busy , do n't bother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some affronted worthy gave out the story of a nonexistent " gim me " telegram . Another case of distorted facts was shipped from Boston , and upon my head was heaped the wrath of a considerable portion of womanhood . I was set up as holding women writers in low contempt. , especially when they tackled baseball . Here are the facts : I was having breakfast alone in the dining room of the Boston hotel where the Giants quarter . Suddenly a woman appeared , and with a cameraman . She asked for an interview . I asked to be excused until later , and certainly did n't want any pictures taken during my meal . She would n't leave until the headwaiter had prevailed upon her to do so . After breakfast I was sitting in the lobby reading a newspaper . Several players were standing around me . Suddenly a woman popped her head through the circle of players and said : " Oh , Mr. Terry ! " I yanked down the paper and lifted my hat . There was a blinding flash of light and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrested childhood . The photographer hotfooted through the lobby with his picture , and I cut . loose with a steam-heated opinion of what I thought of women sports writers . That story , garbled and regarbied , went out across the country to show what a genuine heel this Terry really was . And they even published the picture of the sweet thing " before Terry insulted her ! " Well , these things piled up , and I began to get calloused . Day after day the newspapers contained an increasing number of pot shots , subtleties and gags . As the personal barbs and aspersions increased , the real news of baseball decreased , because of space limitations . It struck me that perhaps the baseball fans would get weary of reading personal prejudices of Terry , and I believe they have . It is my firm belief that a baseball fan subjected to this anti-Terry drivel much longer will soon limit his reading to a brief perusal of the team standing . That daily tabulation contains win-orlose facts , regardless of whether the top team is managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my belief that a baseball fan goes to the ball park to see the contest , and only then does he develop an interest in personalities as analyzed in the papers . Perhaps I am wrong , but the Giants ' attendance figures for the past few years would indicate that patrons do not care who or what manages a ball club , so long as that club plays heads-up and first-division baseball . It was about a year ago that the sports editor who failed to get . the unlisted telephone number  --  which he can have now , by the way , because I do n't live in Crestwood any more  --  paid me a visit at my hotel in Miami Beach , and partook of my Liquid hospitality . " Bill , " he said condescendingly , " let 's bury the hatchet ! " This seemed very inconsistent to me , inasmuch as the hatchet had been buried in my skull for three years . " That would be fine , " I replied , " if I had any hatchet to bury . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans .

The whole tone of his baseball page would have changed back again . Terry would have been a great . guy . But sometimes it 's healthier to pass up an opportunity . He got off a lot easier than the visitor who crawled down the aisle of the Rivoli Theater late in the /936 pennant race . The place was dark and I was 1 fl an aisle seat , absorbed in what was on the screen , probably Mickey Mouse . A Gambler Takes a Chance " Listen , Bill , " this unseen visitor whispered , " my little boy is crazy to see Hubbell , talks about Hub in his sleep , my little boy does .

I barged into the lobby , blinked from the sudden glow of lights and spotted the guy . I knew it was the aisle-crawler by the way ho was panting from his retreat . " You damned so-and-so ! " I exclaimed , and he backed into a corner . " If you ever come near me again , I 'll put this fist right through your ' face . " He ( lucked past and out into the street . Incidentally , that 's the only time a gambler ever bothered me in twenty-four years of baseball . Of course , press accounts of last . year 's schedule were very interesting , duo to the close pennant race and the fact that I was finishing the fourth year of my five-year contract . It was generally understood that a new arrangement would be discussed , and specifically I had told Mr. Horace Stoneham that I did not wish to start the final year of my contract without knowing about the future . Beyond that brief statement , my affairs had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridiculous number of ridiculous stories concerning the Giants ' " new manager " was published through the summer .

Bill MeKechnie and Frank Frisch were mentioned as candidates for my job . Several others were " rumored " into New York . Most preposterous , however , was the news story that I would go to Cleveland as manager of the Indians , an American League team . Now , baseball fans read this , digested it , discussed it , argued about it and probably gasped at the astuteness of writers who could dig up inside dope like that . Yet , there was n't a grain of truth in the story . It was thrown together in August and ladled to readers as an authoritative dispatch . One New York writer wrote : " We are giving Terry to the Indians  --  and they can keep him .

The only possible es-planation for the false news story was the fact that I happened to arrange the exhibition-game schedule for the Cleveland Indians , with whom the Giants trained last year . But why stop there ? During the hottest part of the 1937 pennant fight I scheduled plenty of games for spring training , and not only for Cleveland . I arranged an itinerary for the Giants , Jersey City , Philadelphia Phillies and Philadelphia Athletics . I have become a sort of clearinghouse , of late , for train schedules and exhibition games in the South . And so I was made " manager " of Cleveland . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcement . The same Bill Terry who , nearly twenty years before , had sat , broke and bewildered , in a Shreveport cafeteria , agreed to another five-year contract to manage the New York Giants . The salary was the biggest he had ever received . And here are a couple of random excerpts from two New York newspapers published immediately after the announcement : TERRY LOSES OFFICE GOAL 11EGE SALARY COMPENSATION FOR FAILURE TO GET POST Now that he has taken care of himself for the next five years in a handsome fashion , Will Terry is under moral obligation to consolidate the first place held by the Giants today and bring a World Series to the Polo Grounds to pay for the increased overhead . . . . Lucky Bill Terry ! Ho was born under a star that makes men fall upstairs , discover twenty-dollar bills in discarded trousers , please their wives in a choice of neckties and go through life with an unshakable belief in Santa Claus . Oh , well . . . . It is my belief that interpretations such as these make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 I thought otherwise , I am enough of a businessman and have sufficient consideration for my employer to change things by whispering exclusive stories to one , inviting another to my home , and double-crossing the young baseball January 29 , 122k writer , instead of helping him , as I have helped in a few instances . But my five full years as manager of the Giants show three pennants , second and a third . If that is n't good enough for my boss , or the baseball fans who pay my salary , then I am more than willing to go back to pumps , ing gas , or even back to making storage batteries . While the literary dornicks and pot shots have been flying about my head during the past few years , I have been busy helping build an organization for the years to come , a chain of minor- , league clubs that will improve the future of the Giants , if not my own . That I have n't popped off , or popped on somebody 's chin  --  and that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the grounds that I have been too busy building up to waste time on tearing down ; too busy delivering on my job , so that I wo n't have to step down , as I most certainly would if I failed . Managing a major-league baseball club is not easy , which is why they change managers so often in the big show . It is not always the opposing team that supplies the reason . Before he answers to the press , public or even his employer , a manager must answer to his own players . Although they do most of their own thinking under fire . he is nevert heless obliged to make many decisions during the course of a half-dozen ball games , and the character of those answers is more important than mere rightness or wrongness . He can guess and second-guess and get away with it , but he will lose the respect and confidence of his players . Soon the club will founder . Pep will disappear and so will pennant chances . Such a manager " loses " his players . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but have believed every decision . Am I always right ? Certainly not , and I do n't try to kid them into thinking I 'm infallible . If anybody doubts that I have made mistakes as manager of the Giants , I can offer proof of having been wrong . Trades  --  Good and Bad I was wrong on Eddie Mayo , a fine boy and a hustler . I believed him capable of supplying what we needed ; he was not . I was wrong in trading Joe Bowman with cash for George Davis . We needed Davis badly , but I did n't have a high enough opinion of Bowman . He never should have left the Giants . I failed to get a certain good infielder in an important trade by making the wrong choice . And , believe this or do n't , I came very close to trading Harry Damning to Pittsburgh . But here are a few items to which I can point with pardonable pride : Gus Mancuso had never caught a full season with the Cardinals , but I was willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him and a. pitcher . I then made him any regular catcher and we won a pennant . I gave two infielders , an outfielder and a pitcher for Dick Bartell . I got Whitehead for Parmelee . I purchased Jimmy Ripple , who had been buried for five full years at Montreal . Then there was Clydell Castleman . This brings up a painful subject , and I am not punning about Castleman 's cracked vertebra . It concerns the young man himself and how sometimes youth will fling itself for a loss . Columns of indignation were published after that celebrated game in Cincinnati when , with a display of what the writers called " sadism , " I permitted Castleman to take a terrific shellacking . Here 's my story : Castleman needed only experience tinder fire to make him a really good Pitcher . I let him start games and , When the opposition began to gang up cm him , I would send in a relief pitcher . That , I reasoned , as many a manager has reasoned , would save him from punishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well to this treatment . He took to it so well that he expected relief every time , got it after a few innings , and then parked himself in the grandstand with a big cigar . There he enjoyed watching his successor labor away for a cause already lost . Seeing him in the grandstand with that big cigar simply burned me up . He was as contented as the spectators . I told him what I thought he was , lazy and inconsiderate of his teammates , and I wound up with a warning that he would finish the next game he started . The next game came in Cincinnati . He went along until the base hits began to whiz by his skull and then looked over to the dugout . I did n't give him a tumble . The Reds piled up rims and , when his turn at bat finally C-0.17112 , he made no move for the plate . " You 're the hitter ! " I said , and he went to bat . They slapped him for more runs in the next few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're the hitter ! " Came the ninth inning . The Giants were far behind . Castleman was ready to leave , but I pointed to the bat tray and said : " You started this game , and you 're finishing this game . Hit ! " It was n't an easy lesson to give , but it was the only way I could see to handle the boy . His attitude was n't vicious enough to justify more severe reprisal . Ho simply had to be taught that a ball game is more than four innings on the mound and the rest in the grandstand with a big cigar . My players come first with me , and they know it . When one is trying to get a better salary than the club offers , I do not look upon him as a holdout . He is merely shopping . They know what I 've been through , and that I 'll urge paying them what they 're worth and not a penny more or less . They know that I wo n't sacrifice them as steppingstones to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1934 pennant , I made only one comment to a gleeful press : " You gave me the credit last year , so I 'll take the blame for this one . " The Giants of today are an unusual team , in victory or defeat . We may not have this or that which another club , better or worse , might possess . But we have no cliques , no clubhouse lawyers , no whisperings , and no money troubles among the regulars . I have harped for many years on the subject of savings , investments , insurance annuities , bonds and good real estate , and today there is n't a more financially secure group of players in baseball . I am not referring to wealth , but simply to sane . nest-egg saving , which always comes in handy and enables you to look anybody in the eye . When a Giant is swinging at a fast ball , his mind is on the pitch , not on the latest quotation of a wildcat stack . He has no alibi , except that of momentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not come by force , but rather by confidence , one in the other . Players are checked in at night , but not by a door-pounder . They are checked in by a man who carries a passkey , opens the chamber door , checks and goes out silently . I may he " What's-in-it-for-me Terry " to some people , but not to my players , and here 's one reason why : Each year that a company pays us a substantia ! sum for indorsing its product , half of this money is for Terry . The rest is for equal division among twenty players . And so pinch-penny Terry tosses his half into the pot . Twenty of us share equally for our signatures . Perhaps you call that bribery . I do n't . Those players are responsible for much of my success as a manager . I want them to realize it . and this gesture simply emphasizes the fact . My share of the money would put a few more Whiteface cattle on my 300 acres down near Memphis , but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winds up with nothing , just like the guy who does n't grab at all . Having started with close to nothing , do n't relish the idea of finishing that way . Today the engagement ring is out of hock and back where it belongs . Some of the rash promises made by the eighteen-year-old groom have been fulfilled . My oldest son is a sophomore in the University of Virginia , assuring me that his legal training , when it is finished , will he priceless . I believe him . My daughter , thirteen , is boning away in school , and so is a second son , nine . The third son , now five , is just learning how to count . They have n good home , a degree of security and pride in their parents . There will be more security , unless I suddenly alter an economic philosophy and start throwing money away instead of collecting it . I am still employed by the same oil company , but not as a gas-station attendant , because the duties have been lightened . Somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to justify quitting that winter job . Whatever spare time I have between baseball and the oil company is spent in developing my 300 acres . That tract contains crops of corn , hay , cotton  --  and I passed up the Government 's nine-cent offer ? ' Whiteface cattle , some hired help and most of my annual hopes for the future . All this is a far cry from the bitter gall of the Shreveport cafeteria , but the journey was made the hard way  --  deliver or step down . It was made without sympathy and understanding beyond the endless supply to be found in my own home , Perhaps I have been too indifferent , sometimes crudely indifferent. , in my effort to ask odds of nobody and stand on my own feet . No doubt my frankness , financial acumen , refusal to favor one writer over another , and being a poor mixer on either side of the bar has cost me reams of printed praise and public adulation . But I am fortified by the feeling of having converted nothing into something by my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to realize by the knowledge that the difference between a slap on the back and a kick in the pants is a small matter of physiography. already carried away .
