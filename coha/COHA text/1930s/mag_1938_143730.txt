In London last week everyone was complaining " the sun has not been out since before Christmas . " In Venice thermometers crawled down below freezing , stayed there for four consecutive days , while the Grand Canal froze solid . One day it cost $20,000 to clear the snow from Berlin 's streets , a rare event , for special gangs of street sweepers rarely have to be employed in the German capital . But while storms and blizzards raged over all Europe last week , the greatest weather-made sensation broke on the Black Sea . <P> In the palace at Bucharest , King Carol of Rumania , hearing that the weather had turned foul , anxiously wirelessed Commander Gika Dimutriscu of his destroyer Regina Maria ( named after his mother , Queen Marie ) . Aboard the Regina Maria was his son , Crown Prince Mihai , bound for Athens and the wedding of Crown Prince Paul of Greece ( see p. 26 ) , where his mother , divorced Queen Helen , was waiting for him . <P> Commander Dimutriscu radioed : " His Royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Soon the Commander reported that large floating blocks of ice , whipped by a howling gale , had " decommissioned the rudder . " <P> Out at sea veiled in a heavy snowstorm and cut off by temporary failure of her radio the Regina Maria was unmercifully buffeted . Two feet of water flooded the stateroom of the Crown Prince , and the violent wind snapped off one of the destroyer 's masts. , For 36 hours the Regina Maria bucked and plunged , water even in her engine room , spray frozen on her . Her crew got neither food nor sleep . " Ca n't I do something to help ? " asked the nauseated Crown Prince . <P> Finally rescue ships found the Regina Maria , towed her back to the great Rumanian port of Constantsa . For hours special trains had been standing with steam up at Constantsa and two Bulgarian ports at which the Crown Prince might conceivably land . As Mihai stepped ashore , deathly pale from seasickness , he ordered food , drink and warm clothing for the crew , then boarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Athens . At Bucharest he stopped to tell King Carol , " Of course I was badly scared ! "
