San Francisco employers long ago learned from Labor that in bargaining the group is mightier than the individual . In several industries they formed potent associations , first to beat down Labor then to deal with it when unions came to stay . <P> Last week a leader in this evolution toward unionism for employers succeeded in doing for San Francisco business what Labor has never been able to do for itself . In the newly incorporated San Francisco Employers Council , Shipowner Roger Dearborn Lapham offered his fellows one big union of their own , a master association of employers associations . He thus put San Francisco a long jump ahead of any other U. S. city and injected a new factor into Pacific Coast labor relations . <P> Organizer Lapham acknowledged a debt to Great Britain and Sweden . He recollected that Franklin Roosevelt 's commission on British labor practice found effective associations of British employers dealing with unions on a regional basis , observed : " It is evident that the employers learned a good deal as they went along . " Having enrolled established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managers , automobile dealers , general contractors , waterfront employers and draymen , Mr. Lapham 's council announced its intention of becoming " the recognized spokesman in a broad sense for all employers , whether group or individual . " <P> Replaced and disbanded was the less inclusive Industrial Association of San Francisco , long feared and hated by Labor . At the council 's head will be hardheaded Almon E. Roth , now president of the Pacific Coast Waterfront Employers Association , who like many another Coast employer has learned to deal with but not to love organized labor .
