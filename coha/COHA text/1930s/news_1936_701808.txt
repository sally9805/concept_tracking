txt Robert E. Clements , 43-year-old cofounder of the Townsend $200-amonth old-age pension plan , entered no denial today when he was told , while testifying before a special House committee , that one State manager was drawing down fees of from $1,800 to $2,000 a month . The charge , made by James R. Sullivan of Kansas City , counsel for the Congressional inquiry into the affairs of Old Age Revolving Pensions , Ltd. , corporate name of the Townsend Plan , and other schemes financed by pyramided contributions proposing government support of the aged , came toward the close of the first day of the investigation . The questioning of Mr. Clements , the former real estate promoter and associate of Dr. Francis E. Townsend in the development of the pension movement , in which the witness remained calm and collected although he occupied the stand all day , was followed by an audience which hung on his replies . Many of the spectators in the room , the caucus room of the old House Building , were old persons , women as well as men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Townsend movement has a strong following , and one of these , a Townsend supporter , disclosed that he was there to oppose unfavorable questioning . California Fees Involved The State manager , whose fees were alleged to be ten times the amount of the monthly pension sought for persons 60 years old and over , is Edward J. Margett , manager for Northern California . Asked if the assertion were true , Mr. Clements did not deny it . He had discussed the Margett commissions with Dr. Townsend , Mr. Clements said . The cofounder did not say what resulted from the discussion . However , he reminded the committee that the State managers had to split with the Congressional district managers , and pay their own office and other expenses . He conceded that national headquarters had no knowledge of the amount or exact nature of these expenses . Mr. Margett is one of six " area managers " in California , who are uruier a manager for the " Western region , " of which there are three others in the country , it was explained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $50 a week . The funds came in driblets and largely from personal friends of the founders at first , but , in the period from Feb. 1 to Dec. 1 , 1934 , the collections , donations and other contributions , not including some funds received directly by Dr. Townsend , totaled $43,295.34 , it was brought out . Membership 10 Cents a Month At the present time , Mr. Clements said , the rules of the national organization called for contributions of 10 cents a month from each member . But , he added , a great many members were not sending in their dimes . Just how much is the income of the organization with the dime-a-month levy , club dues , and independent donations and rt ceipts , was not brought out . The committee planned to begin inquiry into the bank accounts of the various regional organizations within the movement when the afternoon session convened . Mr. Clements explained that he did not have the records with him . There were some 7,000 records in the Washington office , he said , and it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the witness that the committee wanted the records and wanted them at once . Mr. Clements said he would send for them . Payment Records Demanded Two committee investigators , going with a Townsend representative , found them so numerous that examination had to be deferred until tomorrow . Mr. Clements also was- directed to have the records of payments to regional and State managers and other persons from the national headquarters when he resumes the witness chair tomorrow morning . In its firseattempt to get behind the distribution of funds within the organization , the committee learned from Mr. Clements that the clubs , when formed , pay a fee into the national organization . This amounts to $12.50 in the case of junior clubs , and $25 for senior clubs , or clubs with a minimum of 100 members each . There is a 60-40 split of this initial fee . The district managers get the 40 per cent , the national organization the remaining 60 per cent . The national organization also fixes a payment by clubs , based on quotas , which each club pays to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent is rebated to the regional and district managers . Out of these 20 per cent rebates , Mr. Clements explained , each district manager pays salaries and expenses of his district organization . He indicated the size of contributions with a recollection that one club in Los Angeles has 22,000 members . If all paid the dime monthly dues ? Mr. Clements had said earlier that many do not  --  the regular income from the one club alone would total at least $26,400 a year . Had Not Studied Economics With data on the organization 's finances still to be organized , Mr. Clements told of his business career and the early history of the organization . It was while he was admitting that he had not studied economics to any extent that the first incident of the inquiry occurred . " I have not , , studied economics to any extent , " said-the co-founder of the pension-plan movement . " I have studied tax methods employed in this and foreign countries . I have talked to men who I had reason to believe were well informed and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States . " A man in the front row of seats rose to protest the line of questionring . He was Representative Theo , dore Moritz of Pennsylvania , who has endorsed the ' Townsend plan and is not a member of the committee . " This committee was appointed . " Mr. Moritz declared , " to investigate the Townsend plan , not the private affairs of this witness . " " You are out of order , " Chairman Bell countered . " Please take your seat . " Mr. Moritz did so . Mr. Clements said that he was born , in Amarillo , Texas , and that he was a graduate of a.Fort Worth high school . He never attended college . He first went to Long Beach , Calif. , in 1914 , when he- entered the real estate business there with his father . " When did you first make an income tax return to the government ? " " The records of the government will be the best answer to that question . " " In 1926 , when you started the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you make ? " " I am not sure . The record of it is in Long Beach . " Veering from income tax returns , Mr. Sullivan turned to the origin of the co-foundership . Mr. Clements told of meeting Dr. Townsend for the first time in either 1927 or 1928 , When the physician had been employed to do some work in connection with the Midway City development . Although he had resigned only last Tuesday as secretary-treasurer of the Townsend organization , reputedly because . , of differences with his associate , Mr. Clements included in his story of his association with Dr. Townsend an unsolicited tribute . " I considered Dr. Townsend a brilliant man and a physician of note , " he said . Testifies on Plan 's Inception Dr. Townsend first approached Mr. Clements in regard to the oldage pension in September or October of 1933 , the witness related .

" Mr. Clements provided Dr. Townsend with desk room in his office . The physician busied himself writing pamphlets and circularizing residents in the Los Angeles area in an effort to find out what the reaction was to the plan he had in mind . The response was favorable , Mr. Clements said , and about Jan. 15 the plan was installed in a small office in the Wingham Building . Long Beach . They started with one employe , George Stringer , a bookkeeper , the witness continued . Later they employed a solicitor named Collins , who received $20 a week to begin the house-to-house canvass for members . The first bank account Was opened in the Citizens State Bank of Long Beach .

Mr. Clements said that he did not have membership figures for the area . In California , there were about 1,100 clubs , he said , but he did not know their memberships .
