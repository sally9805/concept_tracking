A pert , imaginative magnifico who was born in Ripon , Wis. and cleaned up a cool million in Chicago 's Marshall Field &; Co. , was Harry Gordon Self ridge , 51 , when in 1909 he started Self ridge &; Co. in London . By impudent American-style promotion it soon became most talked about , one of the most successful of London 's department stores , now has annual sales of some $75,000,000 . Among the earliest of Harry Selfridge 's stunts was an advertisement in the form of an institutional editorial , run daily in the London Times over the by-line " Callisthenes " ( the personal biographer of Alexander the Great ) . The " Callisthenes " articles caught British fancy at once , have long been profitable for the store . Two months ago Selfridge 's " Callisthenes " hopped the sea , made its debut as an advertisement in New York 's Herald Tribune . U. S. storekeepers wondered why . Last week they had a chance to find out when dapper little Mr. Selfridge himself popped up in Manhattan . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself as intended : " to be a contribution , in a way , to the philosophy of business , to try to excite in the public mind a fuller appreciation , a wider recognition of the fine principles , the high sportsmanlike standards of business as now carried on in England , Europe as a whole , and in America . For we are sportsmen , we men of business . . . . " Subsequent columns dealt with such topics as " Sliding on the Surface or Digging Deep ? ' ' , " What Lands Us in the Rough of the Game of Life , " " Thinking Constructively . ' ' Readers who plowed through these lush homilies generally concluded that Harry Selfridge was about to extend his operations to Manhattan . Last week Harry Selfridge , still pert and lively at 79 , declared , " There is nothing further from my mind than to buy a business or associate myself with any business in this country . ' Callisthenes ' in Manhattan , " said Mr. Selfridge , " is purely an extravagant idiosyncrasy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider it extremely impudent in a friendly , comradelike way to print business philosophy and observations to be read at least to a degree by the merchants of this country . ... " <P> Still fond of impudence , he also announced but not in the column of " Callisthenes " : " I think Hitler is absolutely a great patriot . Mussolini also is a patriot , and a fine patriot , but sometimes he seems a little aggressive in his patriotism . "
