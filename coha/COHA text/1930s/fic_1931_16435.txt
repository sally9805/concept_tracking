FADE IN - NIGHT CLOSEUP - RED AND WHITE REVOLVING BARBER POLE DISSOLVE INTO : 1 . CIGAR COUNTER - BARBER SHOP Behind the counter stands Nick the Barber , who is flipping a coin . He is evidently making mental bets with himself . He flips the coin about three times and we see by the expression on his face that he wins each time . Nick is a big figure in the sporting circles of a small city . He is vain about his personal appearance , particularly about his finger nails , which he is always examining and which he frequently polishes on his vest or sleeve . His clothes are a barber shop version of what the well dressed gambler should wear . He wears a large diamond ring and usually smokes a big cigar . A RACING FORM is on the counter in front of him . We now see a fuller view of the shop . The customer gets out of the first chair , presided over by Jack , a good looking young fellow very devoted to Nick , and whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walks over to the counter with his check . He is a crochety little man of about fifty-five . Nick picks up the check and indicates the coin which he is about to flip again . &nbsp; NICKAll right , Joe -- double or nothing ? &nbsp; JOE ( Blustering ) Not me , Nick . I 've paid you double too many times . &nbsp; NICK ( Smiling ) Faint heart never won fair lady nor fat turkey . ( Flipping coin ) Come on . . . . . . heads or tails ? ( By this time Joe has his money out and begins to weaken . Nick catches the coin on the back of his left hand and conceals it with the right ) What do you say ?  --  3  --  &nbsp; JOE ( Deliberating ) I say tails . ( Nick lifts his right hand and reveals the coin . It is a head . Joe is disgusted ) I never seen such a lucky stiff ! ( He slams his money on the counter , pulls his hat down over his eyes and stalks out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess we got enough money to close up now . A couple of small town sports , gambler types , enter the barber shop , and without saying a word , give Nick an inquiring look . He nods his head significantly towards the back , and the two boys exit through door into back room . There are three chairs in the shop . The first one is now empty and the barbers are just finishing their work on the customers in the other two . As Nick passes Jack he stops suddenly and examines Jack 's tie . &nbsp; NICKSay , is that my tie ? &nbsp; JACKWhy  --  when I got up this morning  --  &nbsp; NICK ( Kidding ) Why did n't you put on that new checkered suit of mine ? &nbsp; JACK ( Kidding ) It did n't fit . ( Nick 's attitude toward the boy is kidding and affectionate ) &nbsp; 1ST CUSTOMER ( In second chair - calls out ) Hey , Nick ! ( Nick goes over to him ) Who do you like in that last race at Caliente ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CUSTOMERDo you think he 'll win ?  --  4  --  &nbsp; NICKSure he 'll win . If nothing else , he 'll win by a nose . A colored porter is sweeping up and has worked up near the front door . The second customer gets up and is tying his tie . Nick goes over to him . &nbsp; 2ND CUSTOMERI 'm looking for action tonight , Nick . &nbsp; NICKDo n't worry  --  you 'll get it . ( The telephone rings and Nick goes to it and answers ) Yeah , this is Nick . Oh , hello , Bookie .

Jack passes the dice to the next man in line  --  a traveling salesman , who is better dressed than most of the other men . The traveling salesman takes out a bill . &nbsp; NICK ( Kidding as he covers the money ) Well  --  here 's the big traveling man from the big city .

LOBBY - CITY HOTEL DAY Nick , dressed more resplendently than ever , but still the hick , steps out of the elevator . He has already registered and parked his baggage in his room . He walks around , catching an occasional glance of himself in a mirror , and very much pleased with his appearance . He is a tinhorn gambler out of his element , but eager for the fray . He sizes up the people he passes . He is smoking a cigar , already burned down near the end . Nick strolls over to the desk . There are two clerks . &nbsp; 1ST CLERKEverything satisfactory , Mr. Venizelos ? &nbsp; NICKYeah . . . . Nice hotel you got here . . . Where 's the barber shop ? &nbsp; 1ST CLERKIt 's downstairs , sir . &nbsp; NICKThanks . . . .

Do n't you know who he is ? &nbsp; 1ST CLERKNo , who is he ? &nbsp; 2ND CLERKWhy , he 's the best dressed man that ever stepped out of a Sears Roebuck catalogue . Nick strolls over and sits down in a big chair . He wants time to think and look around . He studies the people who pass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is now burned right down to the end . He takes it out of his mouth to throw it away and looks around for a cuspidor . Right next to him is a tall , bronze cuspidor , looking almost like a vase . Nick starts to put the cigar in it , but examines it more closely , decides it could n't possibly be a cuspidor . Then he cautiously drops the cigar on the floor and steps on it furtively . Nick reaches in his pocket for another cigar ; he has n't one . He looks around for the cigar counter and is immediately interested when he sees Marie , the girl behind it . Marie is a very beautiful blonde . Nick registers he has found something very much to his liking . He polishes his finger nails on his sleeve , gets up and strolls over to the counter confidently . Marie studies him as he comes up . Her conduct is demure , but it is that of a person acting demure . &nbsp; NICKI 'd like a great big heater , Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; MARIEOh !

He quickly grabs big stack of bound money and office reports from his desk and dashes out of back door to hide them . As soon as he is out of the room , Irene reaches in evening bag and takes out RACING FORM . She hesitates for a moment , then stealthily puts it in inside pocket of Nick 's topcoat , which is hanging on coat rack . She goes back to her original position , then her conscience over-powers her . She starts back to the coat to remove the paper . She ca n't go thru with it . She is just reaching into the pocket when Jack runs in from the casino , his clothes torn and his hair tousled . When she sees him , she withdraws her hand hastily  --  without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought so ! So you let these coppers in ! You dirty little stool pigeon ! ( He slaps her squarely in the face ) Nick comes in the other door just in time to see Jack manhandling Irene .

The inside pocket ! ( Nick turns the coat enough to see what 's in the pocket . He sees the Racing Form ) &nbsp; NICKWhy it 's nothing but a Racing Form , you smack-off . He rushes at Jack with redoubled rage and hits him squarely in the face . Jack fights back , hurling a chair at Nick to save himself . Nick picks up wine carafe and hits Jack over the head with it . His body slumps and falls limp . Nick turns immediately to Irene , who has slumped into a chair  --  on the point of fainting . &nbsp; NICKI 'll show him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , the District Attorney and several detectives ( those we saw earlier in the evening ) burst into the room .

( He takes the Racing Form out of Nick 's pocket ) &nbsp; NICKNothin ' but a Racing Form ! &nbsp; DISTRICT ATTORNEYYou probably do n't know there 's an old Blue law that classifies a Racing Form as gambling paraphernalia and makes possession of one punishable by a six months ' jail sentence . I did n't know it myself till just a few days ago . But I know it now , Nick  --  and so do you . Nick 's suspicion immediately races to Irene , and he sneers at her . She turns away , unable to meet his gaze . &nbsp; NICK ( Viciously ) You little rat ! You filthy , double --  -- - &nbsp; DETECTIVE ( Interrupting .

You 're under arrest . &nbsp; DETECTIVE ( Crying out ) Wait ! This guy ai n't unconscious ! He 's dead ! This shocks them all . Nick breaks away from the District Attorney and goes quickly to Jack 's side . He kneels down by the body . There is a pool of blood near the door-step , against which his head has struck . &nbsp; NICKJack ! Jack ! Listen  --  speak to me ! It 's Nick . Your old pal  - -  Nick  - -  -  ( Realizes he is dead - tears in his eyes ) I 'm sorry , boy . . . . Good-bye , boy .

Nick gets up slowly without resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , Nick . &nbsp; NICK ( Quietly ) Let 's go . ( He is almost numb as he starts out . Irene comes up to him ) &nbsp; NICK ( Quietly - hurt ; but without rancor ) So you gave me the works , eh ? ( For a moment she is so overcome that she can not speak . Then , with tears in her eyes , she comes closer to him )  --  114  --  &nbsp; IRENE ( Contritely ) Yes , Nick . . . .
