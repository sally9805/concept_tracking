200her father , who was a very wealthy man , was sick in New York . She and George went right down to her room , and he was very sad about her going away and said she was the loveliest girl he 'd ever seen and that he 'd write her every day too , but she could n't follow what he was saying she was so scared Tony would come down to the boat looking for her . At last the gong rang and George kissed her desperate hard and went ashore . She did n't dare go up on deck until she heard the engineroom bells and felt the shaking of the boat as it began to back out of the dock . Out of the porthole , as the boat pulled out , she got a glimpse of a dapper dark man in a white suit , that might have been Tony , who broke away from the cops and ran yelling and waving his arms down to the end of the wharf . Maybe it was the orchids or her looks or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his table and all the officers rushed her , and she had the time of her life on the trip up . The only trouble was that she could only come on deck in the afternoon because she only had that one dress . She 'd given George a cable to send so when they got to New York Agnes met her at the dock . It was late fall and Margo had nothing on but a light summer dress , so she said she 'd set Agnes up to a taxi to go home . It was only when they got into the cab that she noticed Agnes was wearing black . When she asked her why Agnes said Fred had died in Bellevue two weeks before . He 'd been picked up on Twentythird Street deaddrunk and had died there without coming to . " Oh , Agnes , I knew it . . . I had a premonition on the boat , " sobbed Margo . When she 'd wiped her eyes she turned and looked at Agnes . " Why , Agnes dear , how well you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit . Has Frank got a job ? " " Oh , no , " said Agnes . " You see Miss Franklyn 's teashopsare doing quite well . She 's branching out and she 's made me manageress of the new branch on Thirtyfourth Street at seventyfive dollars a week . Wait till you see our new apartment just off the Drive .... Oh , Margie , you must have had an awful time . " " Well , " said Margo , " it was pretty bad . His people are pretty well off and prominent and all that but it 's hard to get on to their ways . Tony 's a bum and I hate him more than anything in the world . But after all it was quite an experience . . . I would n't have missed it ? ' Frank met them at the door of the apartment . He looked fatterP201than when Margo had last seen him and had patches of silvery hair on either side of his forehead that gave him a distinguished look like a minister or an ambassador . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beautiful young woman you have become . " When he took her in his arms and kissed her on the brow , she smelt again the smell of bayrum and energine she 'd remembered on him . " Did Agnes tell you that I 'm going on the road with Mrs. Fiske ? . . . Dear Minnie Maddern and I were children together . " The apartment was a little dark , but it had a parlor , a diningroom and two bedrooms and a beautiful big bathroom and kitchen . " First thing I 'm goin ' to do , " said Margo , " is take a hot bath . . . . I do n't believe I 've had a hot bath since I left New York . " While Agnes , who had taken the afternoon off from the tearoom , went out to do some marketing for supper , Margo went into her neat little bedroom with chintz curtains on the walls and took off her chilly rumpled summer dress and got into Agnes 's padded dressinggown . Then she sat back in the morrischair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her questions about her life in Havana . Little by little he sidled over to the arm of her chair , telling her how attractivelooking she 'd become . Then suddenly he made a grab for her . She 'd been expecting it and gave him a ringing slap on the face as she got to her feet . She felt herself getting hysterical as he came towards her across the room panting . " Get away from me , you old buzzard , " she yelled , " get away from me or I 'll tell Agnes all about you and Agnes and me we 'll throw you out on your ear . " She wanted to shut up but she could n't stop yelling . " Get away from me . I caught a disease down there , if you do n't keep away from me you 'll catch it too . " Frank was so shocked he started to tremble all over . He let himself drop into the morrischair and ran his long fingers through his slick silver and black hair . She slammed her bedroom door on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed she began to think how she would never see Fred again , and could it have been a premonition when she 'd told them on the boat that her father was sick . Tears came to her eyes . Certainly she 'd had a premonition . The steamheat hissed cozily . She lay back on the bed that was so comfortable with its clean pillows and silky comforter , and still crying fell asleep.  |p202the  psychic removed all clothing before seances at Harvard .

She managed to raise money through the Morris Plan for Margo 's operation when Dr. Dennison said it was absolutelynecessary ' if her health was n't to be seriously impaired , and nursed her the way she 'd nursed her when she 'd had measles when she was a little girl . When they told Margo she never could have a baby , Margo did n't care so much but Agnes cried and cried . By the time Margo began to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if she and Agnes had just been living together always . The Old Southern Waffle Shop was doing very well and Agnes was making seventyfive dollars a week ; it was lucky that she did because Frank Mandeville hardly ever seemed able to get an engagement any more , there 's no demand for real entertainment since the war , he'dp204say . He 'd become very sad and respectable since he and Agnes had been married at the Little Church Around the Corner , and spent most of his time playing bridge at the Lambs Club and telling about the old days when he 'd toured with Richard Mansfield . After Margo got on her feet she spent a whole dreary winter hanging around the agencies and in the castingoffices of musical shows , before Flo Ziegfeld happened to see her one afternoon sitting in the outside officein a row of other girls . By chance she caught his eye and made a faint ghost of a funny face when he passed ; he stopped and gave her a onceover ; next day Mr. Herman picked her for first row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd ever done in her life . Right from the start Agnes said she was going to see to it that Margo did n't throw herself away with a trashy crowd of chorusgirls ; so , although Agnes had to be at work by nine o'clock sharp every morning , she always came by the theater every night after late rehearsalsor evening performances to take Margo home . It was only afterMargo met Tad Whittlesea , a Yale halfback who spent his weekendsin New York once the football season was over , that Agnes missed a single night . The nights Tad met her , Agnes stayed home . She 'd looked Tad over carefully and had him to Sunday dinner at the apartment and decided that for a millionaire 's son he was pretty steady and that it was good for him to feel some responsibility about Margo . Those nights Margo would be in a hurry to give a last pat to the blond curls under the blue velvet toque and to slip into the furcape that was n't silver fox but looked a little like it at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the smells of curling irons and cocoabutter and girls ' armpits and stagescenery and to run down the flight of drafty cement stairs and past old greyfaced Luke who was in his little glass box pulling on his overcoat getting ready to go home himself . She 'd take a deep breath when she got out into the cold wind of the street . She never would let Tad meet her at the theater with the other stagedoor Johnnies . She liked to find him standing with his wellpolished tan shoes wide apart and his coonskin coat thrown open so that you could see his striped tie and soft rumpled shirt , among people in eveningdress in the lobby of the Astor . Tad was a simple kind of redfaced boy who never had much to say . Margo did all the talking from the minute he handed her into the taxi to go to the nightclub . She 'd keep him laughing with stories about thep205other girls and the wardrobewomen and the chorusmen . Sometimes he 'd ask her to tell him a story over again so that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The story about how the chorusmen , who were most of them fairies , had put the bitch 's curse on a young fellow who was Maisie De Mar 's boyfriend , so that he 'd turned into a fairy too , scared Tad half to death . " A lot of things sure do go on that people do n't know about , " he said . Margo wrinkled up her nose . " You do n't know the half of it , dearie . " " But it must be just a story . " " No , honestly , Tad , that 's how it happened . . . we could hear them yelling and oohooing like they do down in their dressingroom . They all stood around in a circle and put the bitches ' curse on him . I tell you we were scared . " That night they went to the Columbus Circle Childs for some ham and eggs . " Gee , Margo , " said Tad with his mouth full as he was finishinghis second order of buttercakes . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . You 're the smartest girl I ever met and damn refined too . " " Do n't worry , Tad , little Margo is n't going to stay in the chorus all her life . " On the way home in the taxi Tad started to make passes at her . It surprised Margo because he was n't a fresh kind of a boy . He was n't drunk either , he 'd only had one bottle of Canadian ale . " Gosh , Margo , you 're wonderful . . . . You wo n't drink and you wo n't cuddlecooty . " She gave him a little pecking kiss on the cheek . " You ought to understand , Tad , " she said , " I 've got to keep my mind on my work . " " I guess you think I 'm just a dumb cluck . " " You 're a nice boy , Tad , but I like you best when you keep your hands in your pockets . " " Oh , you 're marvelous , " sighed Tad , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuzzy collar from his own side of the cab . " Just a woman men forget , " she said . Having Tad to Sunday dinner got to be a regular thing . He 'd come early to help Agnes lay the table , and take off his coat and roll up his shirtsleeves afterwards to help with the dishes , and then all four of them would play hearts and each drink a glass of beefironandwine tonic from the drugstore . Margo hated those Sunday afternoons but Frank and Agnes seemed to love them , and Tad would stay till the last minute before he had to rush off to meet his father at the MetropolitanClub , saying he 'd never had such a good time in his life . One snowy Sunday afternoon when Margo had slipped away fromp206the cardtable saying she had a headache and had lain on the bed all afternoon listening to the hissing of the steamheat almost crying from restlessness and boredom , Agnes said with her eyes shining when she came in in her negligee after Tad was gone , " Margo , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy . He was telling us how this place is the first time in his life he 's ever had any feeling of home . He 's been brought up by servants and ridingmasters and people like that . . . . I never thought a millionaire could be such a dear . I just think he 's a darling . " " He 's no millionaire , " said Margo , pouting . " His old man has a seat on the stockexchange , " called Frank from the other room . " You do n't buy them with cigarstore coupons , do you , dear child ? " " Well , " said Margo , stretching and yawning , " I certainly would n't be getting a spendthrift for a husband .... " Then she sat up and shook her finger at Agnes . " I can tell you right now why he likes to come here Sundays . He gets a free meal and it do n't cost him a cent . " Jerry Herman , the yellowfaced bald shriveledup little castingdirector , was a man all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said she 'd seen Margo having a meal with him at Keene 's Chophousebetween performances , one Saturday , the girls never quit talking about it . It made Margo sore and gave her a sick feeling in the pit of her stomach to hear them giggling and whispering behind her back in the dressingroom . Regina Riggs , a broadfaced girl from Oklahoma whose real given name was Queenie and who 'd been in the Ziegfeld choruses since the days when they had horsecars on Broadway , took Margo 's arm when they were going down the stairs side by side after a morning rehearsal . " Look here , kiddo , " she said , " I just want to tip you off about that guy , see ? You know me , I been through the mill an ' I do n't give a hoot in hell for any of ' em . . . but let me tell you somethin ' . There never been a girl got a spoken word by givin ' that fourflusher a lay . Plenty of ' em have tried it . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game with that guy an ' a beautiful white body 's about the cheapest thing there is in this town .... You got a kinda peart innocent look and I thought I 'd put you wise . " Margo opened her blue eyes wide . " Why , the idea .... What made you think I 'd . . . " She began to titter like a schoolgirl . " All right , baby ,  |p207let  it ride . . . . I guess you 'll hold out for the weddin'bells . " They both laughed . They were always good friends after that . But not even Queenie knew about it when after a long wearing rehearsallate one Saturday night of a new number that was coming in the next Monday , Margo found herself stepping into Jerry Herman 's roadster . He said he 'd drive her home , but when they reached ColumbusCircle , he said would n't she drive out to his farm in Connecticut with him and have a real rest . Margo went into a drugstore and phoned Agnes that there 'd be rehearsals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queenie Rigg 's flat that was nearer the theater . Driving out , Jerry kept asking Margo about herself . " There 's something differentabout you , little girl , " he said . " I bet you do n't tell all you know ... . You 've got mystery . " All the way out Margo was telling about her early life on a Cuban sugarplantation and her father 's great townhouse in the Vedado and Cuban music and dances , and how her father had been ruined by the sugartrust and she 'd supported the family as a child actress in Christmaspantomimes in England and about her early unfortunate marriagewith a Spanish nobleman , and how all that life was over now and all she cared about was her work . " Well , that story would make great publicity , " was what Jerry Herman said about it . When they drew up at a lighted farmhouse under a lot of tall trees , they sat in the car a moment , shivering a little in the chilly mist that came from a brook somewhere . He turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look in her face . " You know about the three monkeys , dear ? " " Sure , " said Margo . " See no evil , hear no evil , speak no evil . " " Correct , " he said . Then she let him kiss her . Inside it was the prettiest farmhouse with a roaring fire and two men in checked lumberman 's shirts and a couple of funny-looking women in Paris clothes with Park Avenue voices who turned out to be in the decorating business . The two men were scenic artists . Jerry cooked up ham and eggs in the kitchen for everybody and they drank hard cider and had quite a time , though Margo did n't quite know how to behave . To have something to do she got hold of a guitar that was hanging on the wall and picked out Siboney and some other Cubansongs Tony had taught her . When one of the women said something about how she ought to do a Cuban specialty her heart almost stopped beating . Blue daylight was coming through the mist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all had a fine country breakfast giggling and kidding in their dressinggowns and Sunday afternoon Jerry drove her in to town and let her out on the Drive near Seventyninth Street . Frank and Agnes were in a great stew when she got home . Tad had been calling up all day . He 'd been to the theater and found out that there were n't any rehearsals called . Margo said spitefully that she had been rehearsing a little specialty and that if any young collegeboy thought he could interfere with her career he had another think coming . The next weekend when he called up she would n't see him . But a week later when she came out of her room about two o'clock on Sunday afternoon just in time for Agnes 's big Sunday dinner , Tad was sitting there hanging his head , with his hick hands dangling between his knees . On the chair beside him was a green florist 's box that she knew when she looked at it was American Beauty roses . He jumped up . " Oh , Margo . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seem to have a good time going around without you . " " I 'm not sore , Tad , " she said . " I just want everybody to understand that I wo n't let my life interfere with my work . " " Sure , I get you , " said Tad . Agnes came forward all smiles and put the roses in water . " Gosh , I forgot , " said Tad and pulled a redleather case out of his pocket . He was stuttering . " You see D-d-dad g-g-gave me some s-s-stocks to play around with an ' I made a little killing last week and I bought these , only we ca n't wear them except when we both go out together , can we ? " It was a string of pearls , small and not very well matched , but pearls all right . " Who else would take me anyplace where I could wear them , you mut ? " said Margo . Margo felt herself blushing . " And they 're not Teclas ? " Tad shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Gosh , you honestly like them , " said Tad , talking fast . " Well , there 's one other thing . . . Dad 's letting me have the Antoinette , that 's his boat , you know , for a two weeks ' cruise this summer with my own crowd . I want you and Mrs. Mandeville to come . I 'd ask Mr. Mandeville too but ... " " Nonsense , " said Agnes . " I 'm sure the party will be properly chaperonedwithout me .... I 'd just get seasick .... It used to be terrible when poor Fred used to take me out fishing . " " That was my father , " said Margo . " He loved being out on the wa/ter . . . yachting . . . that kind of thing .... I guess that 's why I 'm such a good sailor . " " That 's great , " said Tad . At that minute Frank Mandeville came in from his Sunday walk , dressed in his morningcoat and carrying a silverheaded cane , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuffed veal and vegetables and the strawberrypie from which warm spicy smells had been seeping through the air of the small apartment for some time . " Gosh , I like it here , " said Tad , leaning back in his chair after they 'd sat down to dinner . The rest of that spring Margo had quite a time keeping Tad and Jerry from bumping into each other . She and Jerry never saw each other at the theater ; early in the game she 'd told him she had no intention of letting her life interfere with her work and he 'd looked sharply at her with his shrewd boiledlooking eyes and said , " Humph ... I wish more of our young ladies felt like you do . . . . I spend most of my time combing them out of my hair . " " Too bad about you , " said Margo . " The Valentino of the castingoffice . " She liked Jerry Herman well enough . He was full of dope about the theater business . The only trouble was that when they got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at restaurantsand showed her pictures of his wife and children in New Rochelle . She worked hard on the Cuban songs , but nothing ever came of the specialty . In May the show went on the road . For a long time she could n't decidewhether to go or not . Queenie Riggs said absolutely not . It was all right for her , who did n't have any ambition any more except to pick her off a travelingman in a onehorse town and marry him before he sobered up , but for Margo Dowling who had a career ahead of her , nothing doing . Better be at liberty all summer than a chorine on the road . Jerry Herman was sore as a crab when she would n't sign the roadcontract . He blew up right in front of the officeforce and all the girls waiting in line and everything . " All right , I seen it coming . . . now she 's got a swelled head and thinks she 's Peggy Joyce . . . . All right , I 'm through . " Margo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have me confused with somebody else , Mr. Herman . I 'm sure I never started anything for you to be through with . " All the girls were tittering when shep210walked out , and Jerry Herman looked at her like he wanted to choke her . It meant no more jobs in any company where he did the casting . She spent the summer in the hot city hanging round Agnes 's apartment with nothing to do . And there was Frank always waiting to make a pass at her , so that she had to lock her door when she went to bed . She 'd lie around all day in the horrid stuffy little room with furry green wallpaper and an unwashed window that looked out on cinderybackyards and a couple of ailanthustrees and always washing hung out . Tad had gone to Canada as soon as college was over . She spent the days reading magazines and monkeying with her hair and manicuring her fingernails and dreaming about how she could get out of this miserable sordid life . Sordid was a word she 'd just picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sordid , sordid , sordid . She decided she was crazy about Tad Whittlesea . When August came Tad wrote from Newport that his mother was sick and the yachting trip was off till next winter . Agnes cried when Margo showed her the letter . " Well , there are other fish in the sea , " said Margo . She and Queenie , who had resigned from the roadtour when she had a runin with the stage manager , started making the rounds of the castingoffices again . They rehearsed four weeks for a show that flopped the opening night . Then they got jobs in the Greenwich VillageFollies . The director gave Margo a chance to do her Cuban numberand Margo got a special costume made and everything only to be cut out before the dressrehearsal because the show was too long . She would have felt terrible if Tad had n't turned up after Thanksgivingto take her out every Saturday night . He talked a lot about the yachting trip they were going to take during his midwinter vacation . It all depended on when his exams came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sick in bed with kidney trouble and Margo was crazy to get away from the stuffy apartment and nursing Frank and doing the housekeeping for Agnes who often did n't get home from her job till ten or eleven o'clock at night . Frank lay in bed , his face looking drawn and yellow and pettish , and needed attention all the time . Agnes never complained , but Margo was so fed up with hanging around New York she signed a contract for a job as entertainer in a Miami cabaret , though Queenie and Agnes carried on terrible and said it would ruin her career . She had n't yet settled her wrangle with the agent about who wasp211going to pay her transportation south when one morning in February Agnes came in to wake her up . Margo could see that it was something because Agnes was beaming all over her face . It was Tad calling her on the phone . He 'd had bronchitisand was going to take a month off from college with a tutor on his father 's boat in the West Indies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd be able to take anybody he liked for a littlecruise . Would n't Margo come and bring a friend ? Somebody not too gay . He wished Agnes could go , he said , if that was impossible on account of Mr. Mandeville 's being sick who else could she take ? Margo was so excited she could hardly breathe . " Tad , how wonderful , " she said . " I was planning to go south this week anyway . You must be a mindreader . " Queenie Riggs arranged to go with her though she said she 'd never been on a yacht before and was scared she would n't act right . " Well , I spent a lot of time in rowboats when I was a kid . . . . It 's the same sort of thing , " said Margo . When they got out of the taxicab at the Penn station there was Tad and a skinny little sleekhaired boy with him waiting to meet them . They were all very much excited and the boys ' breaths smelled pretty strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Tad , takingMargo by the arm and pushing some bills down into the pocket of her furcoat . " The reservations are in your name , you 'll have a drawingroom and we 'll have one . " " A couple of wise guys , " whispered Queenie in her ear as they stood in line at the ticketwindow . The other boy 's name was Dick Rogers . Margo could see right away that he thought Queenie was too old and not refined enough . Margo was worried about their baggage too . Their bags looked awful cheap beside the boys ' pigskin suitcases . She felt pretty down in the mouth when the train pulled out of the station . Here I am pulling a boner the first thing , she thought . And Queenie was throwing her head back and showing her gold tooth and yelling and shrieking already like she was at a fireman 's picnic . The four of them settled down in the girls ' stateroom with the little table between them to drink a snifter of gin and began to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunnel and lights began flashing by in the blackness outside , Queenie pulled down the shade . " My , this is real cozy , " she said. p 212 " Now the first thing I got to worry about is how to get you girls out on the boat . Dad wo n't care if he thinks we met you in Jacksonville , but if he knew we 'd brought you down from New York he 'd raise Hail Columbia . " " I think we 've got a chaperon all lined up in Jacksonville , " said young Rogers . " She 's a wonder . She 's deaf and blind and she ca n't speak English . " " I wish we had Agnes along , " said Tad . " That 's Margo 's stepmother . My , she 's a good sport . " " Well , girls , " said young Rogers , taking a noisy swig from the ginbottle . " When does the necking start ? " After they 'd had dinner in the dining car , they went lurching back to the drawingroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play strip poker but Margo said no . " Aw , be a sport , " Queenie giggled . Queenie was pretty tight already . Margo put on her furcoat . " I want Tad to turn in soon , " she said . " He 's just out of a sickbed . " She grabbed Tad 's hand and pulled him out into the passage . " Come on , let 's give the kids a break . . . . The trouble with you collegeboys is that the minute a girl 's unconventional you think she 's an easy mark . " " Oh , Margo . . . " Tad hugged her through her furcoat as they stepped out into the cold clanging air of the observation platform . " You 're grand . " That night after they 'd gotten undressed young Rogers came in the girls ' room in his bathrobe and said there was somebody asking for Margo in the other stateroom . She slept in the same stateroom with Tad , but she would n't let him get into the bunk with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , peeking from under the covers in the upper berth , " but you know . . . Heaven wo n't protect a workinggirl unless she protects herself . . . . And in my family we get married beforethe loving instead of after . " Tad sighed and rolled over with his face to the wall on the berth below . " Oh , heck . . . I 'd been thinking about that . " She switched off the light . " But , Tad , are n't you even going to kiss me goodnight ? " In the middle of the night there was a knock on the door . Young Rogers came in looking pretty rumpled . " Time to switch , " he said . " I 'm scared the conductor 'll catch us . " " The conductor 'll mind his own damn business , " said Tad grumpily , but Margo had already slipped out and gone back to her own stateroom.  |p213Next  morning at breakfast in the dining car , Margo would n't stop kidding the other two about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate of oysters and they thought they 'd never get over the giggles . By the time they got to Jacksonville Tad had taken Margo back to the observation platform and asked her why the hell they did n't get married anyway , he was free white and twentyone , was n't he ? Margo began to cry and grinned at him through her tears and said she guessed there were plenty reasons why not . " By gum , " said Tad when they got off the train into the sunshine of the station , " we 'll buy us an engagement ring anyway . " First thing on the way to a hotel in a taxi they went to a jeweler 's and Tad bought her a solitaire diamond set in platinum and paid for it with a check . " My , his old man must be some millionaire , " whisperedQueenie into Margo 's ear in a voice like in church . After they 'd been to the jeweler 's the boys drove the girls to the Mayflower Hotel . They got a room there and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their underclothes and took hot baths and laid out their dresses on the beds . " If you want my opinion , " Queenie was saying while she was helping Margo wash her hair , " those two livewiresare gettin ' cold feet . . . . All my life I 've wanted to go on a yachtin ' trip an ' now we 're not gettin ' to go any more than a rabbit ... . Oh , Margo , I hope it was n't me gummed the game . " " Tad 'll do anything I say , " said Margo crossly . " You wait and see , " said Queenie . " But here we are squabblin ' when we ought to be enjoyin ' ourselves . . . . Is n't this the swellest room in the swellest hotel in Jacksonville , Florida ? " Margo could n't help laughing . " Well , whose fault is it ? " " That 's right , " said Queenie , flouncing out of the shampoosteaming bathroom where they were washing their hair , and slamming the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At one o'clock the boys came by for them , and made them get all packed up and check out of the hotel . They went down to the dock in a Lincoln car Tad had hired . It was a beautiful sunny day . The Antoinettewas anchored out in the St. Johns River , so they had to go out in a little speedboat . The sailor was a goodlooking young fellow all in white ; he touched his cap and held out his arm to help the girls in . When Margo put her hand in his arm to step into the boat she felt the hard muscles under the white duck sleeve and noticed how the sun shone on the goldenp 214hairs on his brown hand . Sitting on the darkblue soft cushion she looked up at Tad handing the bags down to the sailor . Tad looked pale from being sick and had that funny simple broadfaced look , but he was a husky wellbuilt boy too . Suddenly she wanted to hug him . Tad steered and the speedboat went through the water so fast it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fear the spray would spoil the new sportsdresses they were wearing for the first time . " Oh , what a beauty , " they both sighed when they saw the Antoinetteso big and white with a mahogany deckhouse and a broad yellowchimney . " Oh , I did n't know it was a steamyacht , " crooned Queenie . " Why , my lands , you could cross the ocean in it . " " It 's a diesel , " said Tad . " Are n't we all ? " said Margo . Tad was going so fast they crashed right in the little mahogany stairway they had for getting on the boat , and for a second it cracked and creaked like it would break right off , but the sailors managed to hold on somehow . " Hold her , Newt , " cried young Rogers , giggling . " Damn , " said Tad and he looked very sore as they went on board . The girls were glad to get up onto the beautiful yacht and out of the tippy little speedboat where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had goodlooking officers in white uniforms and a table was all ready for lunch out under an awning on deck and a Filipino butler was standing beside it with a tray of cocktails and all kinds of little sandwiches cut into fancy shapes . They settled down to lunch in a hurry , because the boys said they were starved . They had broiled Florida lobster in a pink sauce and cold chicken and salad and they drank champagne . Margo had never been so happy in her life . While they were eating the yacht started to move slowly down the river , away from the ramshackle wharves and the dirtylooking old steamboats into the broad reaches of brown river that was splotched with green floating patches of waterhyacinths . A funny damp marshy smell came on the wind off the tangled trees that hid the banks . Once they saw a dozen big white birds with long necks fly up that Tad said were egrets . " I bet they 're expensive , " said Queenie . " They 're protected by the federal government , " said young Rogers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the time they got up from the table they were all pretty well spiffed . Margo had decided that Tad was the swellest boy she 'd ever known and that she would n't hold out on him any longer , no matter what happened.  |p215After  lunch Tad showed them all over the boat . The diningroom was wonderful , all mirrors paneled in white and gold , and the cabins were the coziest things . The girls ' cabin was just like an oldfashioned drawingroom . Their things had been all hung out for them while they 'd been eating lunch . While they were looking at the boat young Rogers and Queenie disappeared somewhere , and the first thing Margo knew she and Tad were alone in a cabin looking at a photograph of a sailboat his father had won the Bermuda race with . Looking at the picture his cheek brushed against hers and there they were kissing . " Gee , you 're great , " said Tad . " I 'm kind of clumsy at this . . . no experience , you know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've had plenty . " With his free hand he was bolting the door . " Will you do like the ring said , Tad ? " When they went up on deck afterwards , Tad was acting kind of funny ; he would n't look her in the eye and talked all the time to young Rogers . Queenie looked flushed and all rumpled up like she 'd been through a wringer , and staggered when she walked . Margo made her fix herself up and do her hair . She sure was wishing she had n't brought Queenie . Margo looked fresh as a daisy herself , she decided when she looked in the big mirror in the upstairs saloon . The boat had stopped . Tad 's face looked like a thundercloud when he came back from talking to the captain . " We 've got to go back to Jacksonville , burned out a bearing on the oilpump , " he said . " A hell of a note . " " That 's great , " said young Rogers . " We can look into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know is , " said Queenie , " where 's that chaperonyou boys were talkin ' about ? " " By gum , " said Tad , " we forgot Mrs. Vinton . . . . I bet she 's been waiting down at the dock all day . " " Too late for herbicide , " said Margo and they all laughed except Tad who looked sourer than ever . It was dark when they got to Jacksonville . They 'd had to pack their bags up again and they 'd changed into different dresses . While they were changing their clothes Queenie had talked awful silly . " You mark my words , Margo , that boy wants to marry you . " " Let 's not talk about it , " Margo said several times . " You treat him like he was dirt . " Margo heard her own voice whining and mean : " And whose businessp 216is it ? " Queenie flushed and went on with her packing . Margo could see she was sore . They ate supper grumpily at the hotel . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd found . Margo did n't want to go and said she had a headache , but everybody said now be a sport and she went . It was a tough kind of a place with oilcloth on the tables and sawdust on the floor . There were some foreigners , wops or Cubans or something , standing against a bar in another room . Queenie said she did n't think it was the kind of place Mother 's little girl ought to be seen in . " Who the hell 's going to see us ? " said Tad still in his grouch . " Do n't we want to see life ? " Rogers said , trying to cheer everybody up . Margo lost track of what they were saying . She was staring through the door into the barroom . One of the foreigners standing at the bar was Tony . He looked older and his face was kind of puffy , but there was no doubt that it was Tony . He looked awful . He wore a rumpled white suit frayed at the cuffs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he talked . The first thing Margo thought was how on earth she could ever have liked that fagot . Out of the corner of her eye she could see Tad 's sullen face and his nice light untidy hair and the cleancut collegeboy way he wore his clothes . She had to work fast . She was just opening her mouth to say honestly she had to go back to the hotel , when she caught sight of Tony 's big black eyes and dark lashes . He was coming towards the table with his mincing walk , holding out both hands . " Querida mia .... Why are you here ? " She introduced him as Antonio de Garrido , her partner in a Cuban dance number on the Keith circuit , but he let the cat out of the bag right away by calling her his dear wife . She could feel the start Tad gave when he heard that . Then suddenly Tad began to make a great fuss over Tony and to order up drinks for him . He and Rogers kept whispering and laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come on the cruise with them . She could see Tad was acting drunker than he really was . She was ready for it when the boys got up to go . Tad 's face was red as a beet . " We got to see the skipper about that engine trouble , " he said . " Maybe Senor de Garrido will see you girls back to the hotel . . . . Now do n't do anything I would n't do . " " See you in the morning , cuties , " chimed in young Rogers . After they 'd gone Margo got to her feet . " Well , no use waiting around this dump .... You sure put your foot in it , Tony . " Tony hadp217tears in his eyes . " Everything is very bad with me , " he said . " I thought maybe my little Margo remembered . . . you know we used to be very fond . Don Manfredo , you remember my patron , Margo , had to leave Havana very suddenly . I hoped he would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him . Now we are no more friends . We have been unlucky at roulette . . . . He has only enough money for himself . " " Why do n't you get a job ? " " In these clothes . . . I am ashamed to show my face . . . maybe your friends ... " " You lay off of them , do you hear ? " Margo burst out . Queenie was blubbering , " You should have bought us return tickets to New York . Another time you remember that . Never leave the homeplate without a return ticket . " Tony took them home to the hotel in a taxi and insisted on paying for it . He made a big scene saying goodnight . " Little Margo , if you never see me again , remember I loved you . . . . I shall keel myself . " As they went up in the elevator they could see him still standing on the sidewalk where they had left him . In the morning they were waked up by a bellboy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter to Margo from Tad . The handwritingwas an awful scrawl . All it said was that the trip was off because the tutor had come and they were going to have to pick up Dad in Palm Beach . Enclosed there were five twenties . " Oh , goody goody , " cried Queenie , sitting up in bed when she saw them . " It sure would have been a long walk home . . . . Honest , that boy 's a prince . " " A damn hick , " said Margo . " You take fifty and I take fifty . . . . Lucky I have an engagement fixed up in Miami . " It was a relief when Queenie said she 'd take the first train back to little old New York . Margo did n't want ever to see any of that bunch again . They had n't finished packing their bags when there was Tony at the door . He sure looked sick . Margo was so nervous she yelled at him , " Who the hell let you in ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head with his eyes closed . Queenie closed up her travelingbag and came over and looked at him . " Say , that bozo looks half-starved . Better let me order up some coffee or something . . . . Was he really your husband like he said ? " Margo nodded. p 218 " Well , you 've got to do something about him . Poor boy , he sure does look down on his uppers . " " I guess you 're right , " said Margo , staring at them both with hot dry eyes . She did n't go down to Miami that day . Tony was sick and threw up everything he ate . It turned out he had n't had anything to eat for a week and had been drinking hard . " I bet you that boy dopes , " Queenie whispered in Margo 's ear . They both cried when it was time for Queenie to go to her train . " I 've got to thank you for a wonderful time while it lasted , " she said . Margo put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train . When they objected down at the desk she said he was her husband . They had to register again . It made her feel awful to have to write down in the book Mr. and Mrs. Antonio de Garrido . Once it was written it did n't look so bad though . It was three days before Tony could get up . She had to have a doctor for him . The doctor gave him bromides and hot milk . The room was seven fifty a day and the meals sent up and the doctor and medicine and everything ran into money . It began to look like she 'd have to hock the ring Tad had given her . It made her feel like she was acting in a play living with Tony again . She was kind of fond of him after all , but it sure was n't what she 'd planned . As he began to feel better he began to talk confidently about the magnificent act they could put on together . Maybe they could sell it to the cabaret she 'd signed an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweettempered kind of a boy . The trouble was that whenever she went out to get her hair curled or something , she 'd always find one of the bellhops , a greasylooking blackhaired boy who was some kind of a spick himself , in the room with Tony . When she asked Tony what about it he 'd laugh and say , " It is nothing . We talk Spanish together . That is all . He has been very attentive . " " Yes , very , " said Margo . She felt so damn lousy about everything she did n't give a damn anyway . One morning when she woke up Tony was gone . The roll of bills in her pocketbook was gone and all her jewelry except the solitaire diamondshe wore on her finger was gone too . When she called up the desk to ask if he 'd paid the bill they said that he had left word for her to be called at twelve and that was all . Nobody had seen him go out . The spick bellhop had gone too. p 219All that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She did n't ask for the bill , but she knew it must be about fifty or sixty bucks . She dressed thoughtfully and carefully and decided to go out to a lunchroom for a cup of coffee . That was all the breakfast she had the price of . Outside it was a warm spring day . The sunshine glinted on the rows of parked cars . The streets and the stores and the newsstands had a fresh sunny airy look . Margo walked up and down the main stem of Jacksonville with an awful hollow feeling in the pit of her stomach . She looked in haberdashery store windows and in the windows of cheap jewelers and hockshops and read over carefully all the coming attractions listed at the movingpicture houses . She found herself in front of a bus station . She read the fares and the times buses left for Miami and New Orleans and Tallahassee and Orlando and Tampa and Atlanta , Georgia , and Houston , Texas , and Los Angeles , California . In the bus station there was a lunch counter . She went in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ring at a hockshop if she did n't barge in on an empty stomach , was what she was thinkingas she sat down at the counter and ordered a cup of coffee and a sandwich.  |p220In  my dreams it always seemsI hear you softly call to meValencia !

The Campers at Kitty HawkOn December seventeenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Brethren onetime editor of the Religious Telescopereceived in his frame house on Hawthorn Street in Dayton , Ohio , a telegram from his boys Wilbur and Orville who 'd gotten it into their heads to spend their vacations in a little camp out on the dunes of the North Carolina coast tinkering with a homemade glider they 'd knocked together themselves . The telegram read : SUCCESS FOUR FLIGHTS THURSDAY MORNING ALL AGAINST TWENTYONE MILE WIND STARTED FROM LEVEL WITH ENGINEPOWER ALONE AVERAGE SPEED THROUGH AIR THIRTYONE MILES LONGEST FIFTYSEVEN SECONDS INFORM PRESS HOME CHRISTMASp 222The figures were a little wrong because the telegraph operator misread Orville 's hasty penciled scrawlbut the fact remainsthat a couple of young bicycle mechanics from Dayton , Ohio had designed constructed and flownfor the first time ever a practical airplane . After running the motor a few minutes to heat it up I released the wire that held the machine to the track and the machine started forward into the wind . Wilbur ran at the side of the machine holding the wing to balance it on the track . Unlike the start on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27 mile wind started very slowly .... Wilbur was able to stay with it until it lifted from the track after a forty foot run . One of the lifesaving men snapped the camera for us taking a picture just as it reached the end of the track and the machine had risen to a height of about two feet . . . . The course of the flight up and down was extremely erratic , partly due to the irregularities of the air , partly to lack of experience in handling this machine . A sudden dart when a little over a hundred and twenty feet from the point at which it rose in the air ended the flight . . . . This flight lasted only 12 seconds but it was nevertheless the first in the history of the world in which a machine carrying a man had raised itself by its own power into the air in full flight , had sailed forwardwithout reduction of speed and had finally landed at a point as high as that from which it started . A little later in the day the machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smashed , almost killing the coastguardsman who tried to hold it down ; it was too badbut the Wright brothers were too happy to carethey 'd proved that the damn thing flew . When these points had been definitely established we at once packed our goods and returned home knowing that the age of the flying machine had come at last . They were home for Christmas in Dayton , Ohio , where they 'd been born in the seventies of a family who had been settled west of the Alleghenies since eighteen fourteen , in Dayton , Ohio , where they 'd been to grammarschool and highschool and joined their father'schurch and played baseball and hockey and worked out on the parallel bars and the flying swing and sold newspapers and builtp 223themselves a printingpress out of odds and ends from the junkheap and flown kites and tinkered with mechanical contraptions and gone around town as boys doing odd jobs to turn an honest penny . The folks claimed it was the bishop 's bringing home a helicopter , a fiftycent mechanical toy made of two fans worked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that had got his two youngest boys hipped on the subject of flightso that they stayed home instead of marrying the way the other boys did , and puttered all day about the house picking up a living with jobprinting , bicyclerepair work , sitting up late nights reading books on aerodynamics . Still they were sincere churchmembers , their bicycle business was prosperous , a man could rely on their word . They were popular in Dayton . In those days flyingmachines were the big laugh of all the crackerbarrel philosophers . Langley 's and Chanute 's unsuccessful experimentshad been jeered down with an I-told-you-so that rang from coast to coast . The Wrights ' big problem was to find a place secluded enough to carry on their experiments without being the horselaugh of the countryside . Then they had no money to spend ; they were practical mechanics ; when they needed anything they built it themselves . They hit on Kitty Hawk , on the great dunes and sandy banks that stretch south towards Hatteras seaward of Albemarle Sound , a vast stretch of seabeachempty except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swarms of mosquitoes and the ticks and chiggers in the crabgrass behind the dunesand overhead the gulls and swooping terns , in the evening fishhawksand cranes flapping across the saltmarshes , occasionally eagles that the Wright brothers followed soaring with their eyes as Leonardo watched them centuries beforestraining his sharp eyes to apprehendthe laws of flight . Four miles across the loose sand from the scattering of shacks , the Wright brothers built themselves a camp and a shed for their glid/ers . It was a long way to pack their groceries , their tools , anything they happened to need ; in summer it was hot as blazes , the mosquitoes were hell ; but they were alone thereand they 'd figured out that the loose sand was as soft as anything they could find to fall in . There with a glider made of two planes and a tail in which they lay flat on their bellies and controlled the warp of the planes by shimmying their hips , taking off again and again all day from a big dune named Kill Devil Hill , they learned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few seconds and soar ever so slightly on a rising aircurrent they decided the time had cometo put a motor in their biplane . Back in the shop in Dayton , Ohio , they built an airtunnel , which is their first great contribution to the science of flying , and tried out model planes in it . They could n't interest any builders of gasoline engines so they had to build their own motor . It worked ; after that Christmas of nineteen three the Wright brothers were n't doing it for fun any more ; they gave up their bicyclebusiness , got the use of a big old cowpasture belonging to the localbanker for practice flights , spent all the time when they were n't working on their machine in promotion , worrying about patents , infringements , spies , trying to interest government officials , to make sense out of the smooth involved heartbreaking remarks of lawyers . In two years they had a plane that would cover twenty-four miles at a stretch round and round the cowpasture . People on the interurban car used to crane their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the field , startled by the clattering pop pop of the old Wright motor and the sight of the white biplane like a pair of ironingboards one on top of the other chugging along a good fifty feet in the air . The cows soon got used to it.  |p225As  the flights got longerthe Wright brothers got backers , engaged in lawsuits , lay in their beds at night sleepless with the whine of phantom millions , worse than the mosquitoes at Kitty Hawk . In nineteen seven they went to Paris , allowed themselves to be togged out in dress suits and silk hats , learned to tip waiterstalked with government experts , got used to gold braid and postponements and vandyke beards and the outspread palms of politicos . For amusementthey played diabolo in the Tuileries gardens . They gave publicized flights at Fort Myers , where they had their first fatal crackup , St. Petersburg , Paris , Berlin ; at Pau they were all the rage , such an attraction that the hotelkeeperwould n't charge them for their room . Alfonso of Spain shook hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King Edward watched a flight , the Crown Prince insisted on being taken up , the rain of medals began . They were congratulated by the Czarand the King of Italy and the amateurs of sport , and the society climbers and the papal titles , and decorated by a society for universal peace . Aeronautics became the sport of the day . The Wrights do n't seem to have been very much impressed by the upholstery and the braid and the gold medals and the parades of plush horses , they remained practical mechanicsand insisted on doing all their own work themselves , even to filling the gasolinetank.  |p226In  nineteen eleven they were back on the dunesat Kitty Hawk with a new glider . Orville stayed up in the air for nine and a half minutes , which remained a long time the record for motorless flight . The same year Wilbur died of typhoidfever in Dayton . In the rush of new names : Farman , Bleriot , Curtiss , Ferber , Esnault-Peltrie , Delagrange ; in the snorting impact of bombs and the whine and rattle of shrapnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been shut off overhead , and we flatten into the mudand make ourselves small cowering in the corners of ruined walls , the Wright brothers passed out of the headlinesbut not even headlines or the bitter smear of newsprint or the choke of smokescreen and gas or chatter of brokers on the stockmarketor barking of phantom millions or oratory of brasshats laying wreaths on new monumentscan blur the memory of the chilly December daytwo shivering bicycle mechanics from Dayton , Ohio , first felt their homemade contraptionwhittled out of hickory sticks , gummed together with Arnstein 's bicycle cement , stretched with muslin they 'd sewn on their sister 's sewingmachinein their own backyard on Hawthorn Street in Dayton , Ohio , soar into the airabove the dunes and the wide beachat Kitty Hawk.  |p227the  stranger first coming to Detroit if he be interested in the busy economic side of modern life will find a marvelous industrial beehive ; if he be a lover of nature he will take notice of a site made forever remarkable by the waters of that noble strait that gives the city its name ; if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legends and records as entertaining and as instructive as the continentcan supplyI 've a longing for my Omaha town I long to go there and settle downDETROIT LEADS THE WORLD IN THE MANUFACTURE OF AUTOMOBILESI want to see my paI want to see my maI want to go to dear old OmahaDETROIT IS FIRSTIN PHARMACEUTICALSSTOVES RANGES FURNACESADDING MACHINESPAINTS AND VARNISHESMARINE MOTORSOVERALLSSODA AND SALT PRODUCTSSPORT SHOESTWIST **30;3421;TOOLONG TORCHES TRUCKSp 228Mr .

" DETROIT THE CITY WHERE LIFE ISWORTH LIVING " Charley AndersonFirst thing Charley heard when he climbed down from the controls was Farrell 's voice shouting , " Charley Anderson , the boy with the knowhow . Welcome to little old Detroit , " and then he saw Farrell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field and his big mouth wide open . " Kind of bumpy , was n't it ? " " It was cold as hell , " said Charley . " Call this a field ? " " We 're getting the Chamber of Commerce het up about it . You can give ' em an earful about it maybe . " " I sure did slew around in that mud . Gosh , I pulled out in such a hurry I did n't even bring a toothbrush . " Charley pulled off his gloves that were dripping with oil from a leak he 'd had trouble with in the bumpy going over the hills . His back ached . It was a relief that Bill Cermak was there to get the boat intop 229the hangar . " All right , let 's go , " he said . " Thataboy , " roared Farrell and put his hand on Charley 's shoulder . " We 'll stop by the house and see if I can fit you into a change of clothes . " At that moment a taxi rolled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He came running over with Charley 's suitcase . He reached the car breathless . " I hope you have a nice journey , sir . " " Check , " said Charley . " Did you get me a walkup ? " " Very nice inexpensiveelevator apartment opposed to the Museum of Municipal Art , " panted Taki in his squeaky voice . " Well , that 's service , " Farrell said and put his foot on the starter of his puttycolored Lincoln towncar . The motor purred silkily . Taki put the suitcase in back and Charley hopped in beside Farrell . " Taki thinks we lack culture , " said Charley , laughing . Farrell winked . It was pleasant sitting slumped in the seat beside Farrell 's welldressedfigure behind the big softpurring motor , letting a little drowsinesscome over him as they drove down broad straight boulevards with here and there a construction job that gave them a whiff of new bricks and raw firboards and fresh cement as they passed . A smell of early spring came off the fields and backlots on a raw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Here 's our little shanty , " said Farrell and swerved into a curving graded driveway and jammed on the brakes at the end of a long greystone house with narrow pointed windows and gothic pinnacleslike a cathedral . They got out and Charley followed him across a terrace down an avenue of boxtrees in pots and through a frenchwindowinto a billiardroom with a heavilycarved ceiling . " This is my playroom , " said Farrell . " After all a man 's got to have someplace to play .... Here 's a bathroom you can change in . I 'll be back for you in ten minutes . " It was a big bathroom all in jadegreen with a couch , an easychair , a floorlamp , and a set of chestweights and indianclubs in the corner . Charley stripped and took a hot shower and changed his clothes . He was just putting on his bestlooking striped tie when Farrell called through the door . " Everything O.K. ? " " Check , " said Charley as he came out . " I feel like a million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a funny way and laughed . " Why not ? " he said . The office was in an unfinished officebuilding in a ring of unfin-p 230ished officebuildings round Grand Circus Park . " You wo n't mind if I run you through the publicity department first , Charley , " said Farrell . " Eddy Sawyer 's a great boy . Then we 'll all get together in my office and have some food . " " Check , " said Charley . " Say , Eddy , here 's your birdman , " shouted Farrell , pushing Charley into a big bright office with orange hangings . " Mr. Sawyer , meet Mr. Anderson . . . the Charley Anderson , our new consulting engineer ... . Give us a buzz when you 've put him through a course of sprouts . " Farrell hurried off leaving Charley alone with a small yellowfaced man with a large towhead who had the talk and manners of a highschoolboy with the cigarette habit . Eddy Sawyer gave Charley 's hand a tremendous squeeze , asked him how he liked the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he ever got airsick , explained that he did terribly , was n't it the damnedest luck seeingthe business he was in , brought out from under his desk a bottle of whiskey . " I bet J. Y. did n't give you a drink .... That man lives on air , a regular salamander . " Charley said he would take a small shot and Eddy Sawyer produced two glasses that already had the ice in them and a siphon . " Say when . " Charley took a gulp , then Eddy leaned back in his swivelchair having drained off his drink and said , " Now , Mr. Anderson , if you do n't mind let 's have the old lifehistory , or whatever part of it is fit to print .... Mind you , we wo n't use anything right away but we like to have the dope so that we can sort of feed it out as occasion demands . " Charley blushed . " Well , " he said , " there 's not very much to tell . " " Thataboy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting away the whiskeybottle . " That 's how all the best stories begin . " He pressed a buzzer and a curlyhaired stenographer with a pretty pink dollface came in and sat down with her notebook at the other side of the desk . While he was fumbling through his story , Charley kept repeating to himself in the back of his head , " Now , bo , do n't make an ass of yourself the first day . " Before they were through Farrell stuck his head in the door and said to come along , the crowd was waiting . " Well , did you get all fixed up ? . . . Charley , I want you to meet our salesmanager . . . Joe Stone , Charley Anderson . And Mr. Frank and Mr. O'Brien , our battery of legal talent , and Mr. Bledsoe , he 's in charge of output . . . that 's your department . " p 231Charley shook a number of hands ; there was a slick black head with hair parted in the middle , a pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a shoebrush , noseglasses , tortoiseshell glasses , one small mustache . " Sure mike , " Eddy Sawyer was stuttering away nervously . " I 've got enough on him to retire on the blackmail any time now . " " That 's a very good starter , young man , " said Cyrus Bledsoe , the greyhaired man , gruffly . " I hope you 've got some more notions left in the back of your head . " " Check , " said Charley . They all , except Bledsoe who growled that he never ate lunch , went out with him to the Athletic Club where they had a private diningroomand cocktails set out . Going up in the elevator a voice behind him said , " How 's the boy , Charley ? " and Charley turned round to find himself face to face with Andy Merritt . Andy Merritt 's darkgrey suit seemed to fit him even better than usual . His sour smile was unusuallythin . " Why , what are you doing here ? " Charley blurted out . " Detroit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has always interested me extremely . " " Say , how 's Joe making out ? " Andy Merritt looked pained and Charley felt he ought to have kept his mouth shut . " Joe was in excellenthealth when I last saw him , " said Andy . It turned out that Andy was lunching with them too . When they were working on the filetmignon , Farrell got up and made a speech about how this luncheon was a beginning of a new spirit in the business of manufacturing airplane parts and motors and that the time had come for the airplane to quit hanging on the apron strings of the automotive business because airplanes were going to turn the automobile men into a lot of bicycle manufacturers before you could say Jack Robinson . A milliondollar business had to be handledin a milliondollar way . Then everybody yelled and clapped and Farrell held up his hand and described Charley Anderson 's career as a war ace and an inventor and said it was a very happy day , a day he 'd been waiting for a long time , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eddy Sawyer led a cheer for Anderson and Charley had to get up and say how he was glad to get out there and be back in the great open spaces and the real manufacturing center of this country , and when you said manufacturing center of this country whatp232you meant was manufacturing center of the whole bloody world . Eddy Sawyer led another cheer and then they all settled down to eat their peachmelba . When they were getting their hats from the checkroom downstairs Andy Merritt tapped Charley on the shoulder and said , " A very good speech . . . . You know I 'd felt for some time we ought to make a break . . . . You ca n't run a bigtime business with smalltown ideas . That 's the trouble with poor old Joe who 's a prince , by the way .. . smalltown ideas .... " Charley went around to see the apartment . Taki had everything fixed up in great shape , flowers in the vases and all that sort of thing . " Well , this is slick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Detroit ? " " Very interesting , " said Taki . " Mr. Ford permits to visit HighlandPark . " " Gosh , you do n't lose any time .... Nothing like that assemblyline in your country , is there ? " Taki grinned and nodded . " Very interesting , " he said with more emphasis . Charley took off his coat and shoes and lay down on the couch in the sittingroom to take a nap but it seemed he 'd just closed his eyes when Taki was grinning and bowing from the door . " Very sorry , sir , Mr. Benton , longdistance . " " Check , " said Charley . Taki had his slippers there for him to stick his feet into and had discreetlylaid his bathrobe on a chair beside the couch . At the phone Charley noticed that it was already dusk and that the streetlights were just coming on . " Hello , Nat . " " Hay , Charley , how are you making out ? " " Great , " said Charley . " Say , I just called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be elected vicepresidents at the next meeting of Tern stockholders . " " How do you know ? " Nat laughed into the phone . " Some intelligence service , " said Charley . " Well , service is what we 're here for , " said Nat . " And , Charley , there 's a little pool down here ... . I 'm taking a dip myself and I thought you might like to come in . . . . I ca n't tell you the details over the phone but I wrote you this afternoon . " " I have n't got any cash . " " You could put up about ten grand of stock to cover . The stock wo n't be tied up long . " " Check , " said Charley . " Shoot the moon . . . this is my lucky year . " The plant was great . Charley drove out there in a new Buick sedan he bought himself right off the dealer 's floor the next morning . The dealer seemed to know all about him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a pleasure to have your account , Mr. Anderson , " he said . Old Bledsoe seemed to be on the lookout for him and showed him around . Everything was lit with skylights . There was n't a belt in the place . Every machine had its own motor . " Farrell thinks I 'm an old stickinthemud because I do n't talk high finance all the time , but God damn it , if there 's a more uptodate plant than this anywhere , I 'll eat a goddamned dynamo . " " Gee , I thought we were in pretty good shape out at Long Island City . . . . But this beats the Dutch . " " That 's exactly what it 's intended to do , " growled Bledsoe . Last Bledsoe introduced Charley to the engineering force and then showed him into the office off the draftingroom that was to be his . They closed the groundglass door and sat down facing each other in the silvery light from the skylight . Bledsoe pulled out a stogie and offeredone to Charley . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . " Charley said he 'd try anything once . They lit the stogies and Bledsoebegan to talk between savage puffs of stinging blue smoke . " Now look here , Anderson , I hope you 've come out here to work with us and not to juggle your damned stock . . . . I know you 're a war hero and all that and are slated for windowdressing , but it looks to me like you might have somepun in your head too . . . . I 'm saying this once and I 'll never say it again . . . . If you 're workin ' with us , you 're workin ' with us and if you 're not you 'd better stick around your broker 's office where you belong . " " But , Mr. Bledsoe , this is the chance I 've been lookin ' for , " stammeredCharley . " Hell , I 'm a mechanic , that 's all . I know that . " " Well , I hope so . . . . If you are , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lousy and the ships they put it in are lousy . We 're ten years behind the rest of the world in flyin ' and we 've got to catch up . Once we get the designs we 've got the productionapparatus to flatten ' em all out . Now I want you to go home and get drunk or go wenchin ' or whatever you do when you 're worried and think about this damn business . " " I 'm through with that stuff , " said Charley . " I had enough of that in New York . " Bledsoe got to his feet with a jerk , letting the ash from his stogie fall on his alpaca vest . " Well , you better get married then . " " I been thinkin ' of that . . . . But I ca n't find the other name to put on the license , " said Charley , laughing . Bledsoe smiled . " You design me a de-p 234cent light dependable sixteen-cylinder aircooled motor and I 'll get my little girl to introduce you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em all . . . . And if it 's money you 're lookin ' for , they sweat money . " The phone buzzed . Bledsoe answered it , muttered under his breath , and stamped out of the office . At noon Farrell came by to take Charley out to lunch . " Did old Bledsoe give you an earful ? " he asked . Charley nodded . " Well , do n't let him get under your skin . His bark is worse than his bite . He would n't be in the outfit if he was n't the best plantmanager in the country . " It was at the Country Club dance that Farrell and his wife , who was a thin oldish blonde haggard and peevish under a festoon of diamonds , took him out to , that Charley met old Bledsoe 's daughter Anne . She was a squareshouldered girl in pink with a large pleasantlysmilingmouth and a firm handshake . Charley cottoned to her first thing . They danced to Just a Girl That Men Forget and she talked about how crazy she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's license . Charley said he 'd take her up any time if she was n't too proud to fly a Curtiss-Robin . She said he 'd better not make a promise if he did n't intend to keep it because she always did what she said she 'd do . Then she talked about golf and he did n't let on that he 'd never had a golfclub in his hand in his life . At supper when he came back from getting a couple of plates of chickensalad he found her sitting at a round table under a Japanese lantern with a pale young guy , who turned out to be her brother Harry , and a girl with beautiful ashen-blond hair and a touch of Alabamain her talk whose name was Gladys Wheatley . She seemed to be engaged or something to Harry Bledsoe who had a silver flask and kept pouring gin into the fruitpunch and held her hand and called her Glad . They were all younger than Charley , but they made quite a fuss over him and kept saying what a godawful town Detroit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him he started telling war yarns for the first time in his life . He drove Anne home and old Bledsoe came out with a copy of the Engineering Journal in his hand and said , " So you 've got acquainted , have you ? " " Oh , yes , we 're old friends , Dad , " she said . " Charley 's goingto teach me to fly . " " Humph , " said Bledsoe and closed the door in Charley 's face with a growling : " You go home and worry about that motor . " p 235All that summer everybody thought that Charley and Anne were engaged . He 'd get away from the plant for an hour or two on quiet afternoonsand take a ship up at the flyingfield to give her a chance to pile up flying hours and on Sundays they 'd play golf . Charley would get up early Sunday mornings to take a lesson with the golf pro out at the Sunnyside Club where he did n't know anybody . Saturday nights they 'd often have dinner at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dance . Gladys Wheatley and Harry were usually along and they were known as a foursome by all the younger crowd . Old Bledsoe seemed pleased that Charley had taken up with his youngsters and began to treat him as a member of the family . Charley was happy , he enjoyed his work ; after the years in New York being in Detroit was like being home . He and Nat made some killings in the market . As vicepresident and consulting engineer of the Tern Companyhe was making $25,000 a year . Old Bledsoe grumbled that it was too damn much money for a young engineer , but it pleased him that Charley spent most of it on a small experimental shop where he and Bill Cermak were building a new motor on their own . Bill Cermak had moved his family out from Long Island and was full of hunches for mechanical improvements . Charley was so busy he did n't have time to think of women or take anything but an occasional drink in a social way . He thought Anne was a peach and enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl he might someday go to bed with . Over the Labor Day weekend the Farrells invited the young Bledsoesand Gladys Wheatley out for a cruise . When he was asked Charleyfelt that this was highlife at last and suggested he bring Taki along to mix drinks and act as steward . He drove the Bledsoes down to the yachtclub in his Buick . Anne could n't make out why he was feeling so good . " Nothing to do for three days but sit around on a stuffy old boat and let the mosquitoes bite you , " she was grumbling in a gruff tone like her father 's . " Dad 's right when he says he does n't mind working over his work but he 's darned if he 'll work over his play . " " But look at the company we 'll have to suffer in , Annie . " Charley put his arm round her shoulders for a moment as she sat beside him on the front seat . Harry who was alone in the back let out a giggle . " Well , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anne , without turning back . " You and Gladys certainly do enough public petting to make a cat sick . " " The stern birdman 's weakening , " said Harry . Char-p 236ley blushed . " Check , " he said . They were already at the yachtclub and two young fellows in sailorsuits were taking the bags out of the back of the car . Farrell 's boat was a fast fiftyfoot cruiser with a diningroom on deck and wicker chairs and a lot of freshvarnished mahogany and polished brass . Farrell wore a yachtingcap and walked up and down the narrowdeck with a worried look as the boat nosed out into the little muggy breeze . The river in the late afternoon had a smell of docks and weedy swamps . " It makes me feel good to get out on the water , do n't it you , Charley ? . . . The one place they ca n't get at you . " Meanwhile Mrs. Farrell was apologizing to the ladies for the cramped accommodations . " I keep trying to get Yardly to get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me every one he gets is more cramped up than the last one . " Charley had been listening to a light clinking sound from the pantry . When Taki appeared with a tray of manhattan cocktails everybodycheered up . As he watched Taki bobbing with the tray in front of Gladys , Charley thought how wonderful she looked all in white with her pale abundant hair tied up in a white silk handkerchief . Smiling beside him was Anne with her brown hair blowing in her eyes from the wind of the boat 's speed . The engine made so much noise and the twinscrews churned up so much water that he could talk to her without the others ' hearing . " Annie , " he said suddenly , " I been thinking it 's about time I got married . " " Why , Charley , a mere boy like you . " Charley felt warm all over . All at once he wanted a woman terribly bad . It was hard to control his voice . " Well , I suppose we 're both old enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposition ? I 've been pretty lucky this year as far as dough goes . " Anne sipped her cocktail looking at him and laughing with her hair blowing across her face . " What do you want me to do , ask for a statement of your bankdeposit ? " " But I mean you . " " Check , " she said . Farrell was yelling at them , " How about a little game of penny ante before supper ? . . . It 's gettin ' windy out here . We 'd be better off in the saloon . " " Aye , aye , cap , " said Anne. p 237Before supper they played penny ante and drank manhattans and after supper the Farrells and the Bledsoes settled down to a game of auction . Gladys said she had a headache and Charley , after watching the game for a while , went out on deck to get the reek of the cigar he 'd been smoking out of his lungs . The boat was anchored in a little bay , near a lighted wharf that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocky point where one tall pine reached out of a dark snarl of branches above a crowd of shivering whitebirches . At the end of the wharf there was some sort of clubhouse that split ripples of light from its big windows ; dancemusic throbbed and faded from it over the water . Charley sat in the bow . The boys who ran the boat for Farrell had turned in . He could hear their low voices and catch a smell of cigarette smoke from the tiny hatch forward of the pilothouse . He leaned over to watch the small grey waves slapping against the bow . " Bo , this is the bigtime stuff , " he was telling himself . When he turned around there was Gladys beside him . " I thought you 'd gone to bed , young lady , " he said . " Thought you 'd gotten rid of me for one night ? " She was n't smiling . " Do n't you think it 's a pretty night , Glad ? " He took her hand ; it was trembling and icecold . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . She dug her long nails into his hand . " Are you going to marry Anne ? " " Maybe . . . . Why ? You 're goin ' to marry Harry , are n't you ? " " Nothing in this world would make me marry him . " Charley put his arms round her . " You poor little girl , you 're cold . You ought to be in bed . " She put her head on his chest and began to sob . He could feel the tears warm through his shirt . He did n't know what to say . He stood there hugging her with the smell of her hair giddy , like the smell of Doris 's hair used to be , in his nostrils . " I wish we were off this damn boat , " he whispered . Her face was turned up to his , very round and white . When he kissed her lips she kissed him too . He pressed her to him hard . Now it was her little breasts he could feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him put his tongue between her lips , then she pushed him away . " Charley , we ought n't to be acting like this , but I suddenly felt so lonely . " Charley 's voice was gruff in his throat . " I 'll never let you feel likep238that again . . . . Never , honestly . . . never . . . . " " Oh , you darling Charley . " She kissed him again very quickly and deliberately and ran away from him down the deck . He walked up and down alone . He did n't know what to do . He was crazy for Gladys now . He could n't go back and talk to the others . He could n't go to bed . He slipped down the forward hatch and through the galley , where Taki sat cool as a cucumber in his white coat reading some thick book , into the cabin where his berth was and changed into his bathingsuit and ran up and dove over the side . The water was n't as cold as he 'd expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pulling himself up the ladder aft he felt cold and goosefleshy . Farrell with a cigar in his teeth leaned over , grabbed his hand and hauled him on deck . " Ha , ha , the iron man , " he shouted . " The girls beat us two rubbers and went to bed with their winnings . Suppose you get into your bathrobeand have a drink and a half an hour of red dog or something silly before we turn in . " " Check , " said Charley , who was jumping up and down on the deck to shake off the water . While Charley was rubbing himself down with a towel below , he could hear the girls chattering and giggling in their stateroom . He was so embarrassed when he sat down next to Harry who was a little drunk and silly so that he drank off a half a tumbler of rye and lost eighty dollars . He was glad to see that it was Harry who won . " Lucky at cards , unlucky in love , " he kept saying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gladys took Charley to see her parents after they 'd had tea together at his flat chaperoned by Taki 's grin and his bobbing black head . Horton B. Wheatley was a power , so Farrell said , in the Security Trust Company , a redfaced man with grizzled hair and a small silvery mustache . Mrs. Wheatley was a droopy woman with a pretty Alabama voice and a face faded and pouchy and withered as a spent toyballoon . Mr. Wheatley started talking before Gladys had finished the introductions : " Well , sir , we 'd been expectin ' somethin ' like that to happen . Of course it 's too soon for us all to make up our minds , but I do n't see how I kin help tellin ' you , ma boy , that I 'd rather see ma daughter wedded to a boy like you that 's worked his way up in the world , even though we do n't know much about you yet , than to a boy like Harry who 's a nice enough kid in his way , but who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schoolin ' his father providedp239for him . Ma boy , we are mighty proud , my wife and me , to know you and to have you and our little girl . . . she 's all we 've got in this world so she 's mighty precious to us ... " " Your parents are . . . have been called away , I believe , Mr. Anderson , " put in Mrs. Wheatley . Charley nodded . " Oh , I 'm so sorry ... . They were from St. Paul , Gladys says .... " Mr. Wheatley was talking again . " Mr. Anderson , Mother , was one of our most prominent war aces , he won his spurs fightin ' for the flag , Mother , an ' his whole career seems to me to be an example . . . now I 'm goin ' to make you blush , ma boy . . . of how American democracy works at its very best pushin ' forward to success the most intelligent and bestfitted and weedin ' out the weaklin 's . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to ask you to do right now . I 'm goin ' to ask you to come to church with us next Sunday an ' address ma Sundayschool class . I 'm sure you wo n't mind sayin ' a few words of inspiration and guidance to the youngsters there . " Charley blushed and nodded . " Aw , Daddy , " sang Gladys , putting her arms around both their necks , " do n't make him do that . Sunday 's the only day the poor boy gets any golf .... You know I always said I never would marry a Sundayschool teacher . " Mr. Wheatley laughed and Mrs. Wheatley cast down her eyes and sighed . " Once wo n't hurt him , will it , Charley ? " " Of course not , " Charley found himself saying . " It would be an inspiration . " Next day Charley and Mr. Wheatley had lunch alone at the UniversityClub . " Well , son , I guess the die is cast , " said Mr. Wheatley when they met in the lobby . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nothin ' for us to do but bow to the decision . I certainlywish you children every happiness , son .... " As they ate Mr. Wheatleytalked about the bank and the Tern interests and the merger with Askew-Merritt that would a little more than double the capitalization of the new Tern Aviation Company . " You 're surprised that I know all about this , Charley . . . that 's what I 'd been thinkin , that boy 's a mechanicalgenius but he do n't keep track of the financial end . . . he do n't realize what his holdin 's in that concern mean to him and the financial world . " " Well , I know some pretty good guys who give me the lowdown , " said Charley . " Fair enough , fair enough , " said Mr. Wheatley , " but now that it 's in the family maybe some of ma advice , the result of twenty years ofp 240bankin ' experience at home in Birmingham and here in this great new dazzlin ' city of Detroit ... " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Wheatley , " stammeredCharley . Mr. Wheatley went on to talk about a lot on the waterfront with riparianrights at Grosse Pointe he was planning to turn over to the children for a wedding present and how they ought to build on it right away if only as an investment in the most restricted residential area in the entire United States of America . " And , son , if you come around to ma office after lunch you 'll see the plans for the prettiest little old English house to set on that lot you ever did see . I 've been havin " em drawn up as a surprise for Mother and Gladys , by Ordway and Ordway . . . . Halftimbered Tudor they call it . I thought I 'd turn the whole thing over to you children , as it 'll be too big for Mother and me now that Gladys is gettin ' married . I 'll chip in the lot and you chip in the house and we 'll settle the whole thing on Gladys for any children . " They finished their lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook it . " And I sincerely hope and pray that there 'll be children , son . " Just after Thanksgiving the society pages of all the Detroit papers were full of a dinnerdance given by Mr. and Mrs. Horton B. Wheatley to announce the approaching marriage of their daughter Gladys to Mr. Charles Anderson inventor war ace and head of the research departmentat the great Tern Airplane Plant . Old Bledsoe never spoke to Charley after the day the engagement was announced but Anne came over to Charley and Gladys the night of the Halloween dance at the Country Club and said she thoroughly understood and wished them every happiness . A few days before the wedding Taki gave notice . " But I thought you would stay on . . . . I 'm sure my wife would like it too . Maybe we can give you a raise . " Taki grinned and bowed . " It is regrettable , " he said , " that I experience only bachelor establishments . . . but I wish you hereafter every contentment . " What hurt Charley most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be his bestman , he wired back only one word : " No . " The wedding was at the Emmanuel Baptist Church . Charley wore a cutaway and new black shoes that pinched his toes . He kept trying to remember not to put his hand up to his tie . Nat Benton came on from241New York to be bestman and was a great help . While they were waiting in the vestry Nat pulled a flask out of his pants pocket and tried to get Charley to take a drink . " You look kinda green around the gills , Charley . " Charley shook his head and made a gesture with his thumb in the direction from which the organ music was coming . " Are you sure you got the ring ? " Nat grinned and took a drink himself . He cleared his throat . " Well , Charley , you ought to congratulate me for picking a winner . . . . If I could spot the market like I can spot a likely youngster I 'd be in the money right now . " Charley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . do n't worry , Nat , I 'll take care of you . " They both laughed and felt better . An usher was already beckoning wildly at them from the vestry door . Gladys in so many satinwhite frills and the lace veil and the orangeblossoms , with a little boy in white satin holding up her train , looked like somebody Charley had never seen before . They both said " I will " rather loud without looking at each other . At the reception afterwards there was no liquor in the punch on account of the Wheatleys . Charleyfelt half-choked with the smell of the flowers and of women 's furs and with trying to say something to all the overdressed old ladies he was introduced to , who all said the same thing about what a beautiful wedding . He 'd just broken away to go upstairs to change his clothes when he saw 011ie Taylor , very tight , trip on a Persian rug in the hall and measure his length at the feet of Mrs. Wheatley who 'd just come out of the receptionroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charley kept right on upstairs . In spite of the wedding 's being dry , Nat and Farrell had certainly had something , because their eyes were shining and there was a moist look round their mouths when they came into the room where Charleywas changing into a brown suit for traveling . " Lucky bastards , " he said . " Where did you get it ? ... Gosh , you might have kept 011ie Taylor out . " " He 's gone , " said Nat . They added in chorus , " We attend to every-thing . " " Gosh , " said Charley , " I was just thinkin ' it 's a good thing I sent my brother in Minneapolis and his gang invitations too late for ' em to get here . I can just see my old Uncle Vogel runnin ' around pinchin ' the dowagers in the seat and cryin ' hochheit . " " It 's too bad about 011ie , " said Nat . " He 's one of the besthearted fellers in the world . " p 242 " Poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost his grip . " There was a knock on the door . It was Gladys , her little face pale and goldenhaired and wonderfullooking in the middle of an enormouschinchilla collar . " Charley , we 've got to go . You naughty boy , I do n't believe you 've looked at the presents yet . " She led them into an upstairs sittingroom stacked with glassware and silver table articles and flowers and smokingsets and toiletsets and cocktailshakers until it looked like a departmentstore . " Are n't they sweet ? " she said . " Never saw anythin ' like it in my life , " said Charley . They saw some guests coming in at the other end and ran out into the back hall again . " How many detectives have they got ? " asked Charley . " Four , " said Gladys . " Well , now , " said Charley . " We vamoose . " " Well , it 's time for us to retire , " chorused Farrell and Nat suddenly doubled up laughing . " Or may we kiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Thank all the ushers for me . " Gladys fluttered her hand . " You are dears . . . go away now . " Charley tried to hug her to him but she pushed him away . " Daddy 's got all the bags out the kitchen door .... Oh , let 's hurry . . . . Oh , I 'm almostcrazy . " They ran down the back stairs and got into a taxi with their baggage . His was pigskin ; hers was shiny black . The bags had a new expensivesmell . Charley saw Farrell and Nat come out from under the columns of the big colonial porch but before they could throw the confetti the taxidriver had stepped on the gas and they were off . At the depot there was nobody but the Wheatleys , Mrs. Wheatley crying in her baggy mink coat , Mr. Wheatley orating about the Americanhome whether anybody listened or not . By the time the train pulled out Gladys was crying too and Charley was sitting opposite her feeling miserable and not knowing how the hell to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You know it would n't have been possible in this weather , " said Gladys and then burst out crying again . To have something to do Charley ordered some dinner from the dining car and sent the colored porter to get a pail of ice for the champagne . " Oh , my nerves , " moaned Gladys , pressing her gloved hands over her eyes.  | " After all , kid , it is n't as if it was somebody else . . . . It 's just you and me , " said Charley gently . She began to titter . " Well , I guess I 'm a little silly . " When the porter grinning and respectfully sympathetic opened the champagne she just wet her lips with it . Charley drank off his glass and filled it up again . " Here 's how , Glad , this is the life . " When the porter had gone Charley asked her why she would n't drink . " You used to be quite a rummy out at the countryclub , Glad . " " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " She turned very red . " Mother says that if the parents get drunk they have idiot children . " " Oh , you poor baby , " said Charley , his eyes filling with tears . They sat for a long time looking at each other while the fizz went out of the champagne in the glasses and the champagne slopped out onto the table with the jolting of the train . When the broiled chicken came Gladys could n't eat a bite of it . Charley ate both portions and drank up the champagne and felt he was acting like a hog . The train clanked and roared in their ears through the snowy night . After the porter had taken away the supperdishes Charley took off his coat and sat beside her and tried to make love to her . She 'd only let him kiss her and hug her like they 'd done before they were married . When he tried to undo her dress she pushed him away . " Wait , wait . " She went into the lavatory to get into her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long . He sat in his pyjamas in the icy gritty flow of wind that came in through the crack of the window until his teeth were chattering . At last he started to bang on the door of the toilet . " Anything wrong , Glad ? What 's the matter , darlin ' ? " She came out in a fluffy lace negligee . She 'd put on too much makeup . Her lips were trembling under the greasy lipstick . " Oh , Charley , do n't let 's tonight on the train , it 's so awful like this . " Charley felt suddenly uncontrollably angry . " But you 're my wife . I 'm your husband , God damn it . " He switched off the light . Her hands were icy in his . As he grabbed her to him he felt the muscles of his arms swelling strong behind her slender back . It felt good the way the lace and silk tore under his hands . Afterwards she made him get out of bed and lie on the couchp 244wrapped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them slept . Next day she looked so pale and the bleeding had n't stopped and they were afraid they 'd have to stop somewhere to get a doctor . By evening she felt better , but still she could n't eat anything . All afternoon she lay halfasleep on the couch while Charley sat beside her holding her hand with a pile of unread magazines on his knees . It was like getting out of jail when they got off the train at Palm Beach and saw the green grass and the palmtrees and the hedges of hibiscus in flower . When she saw the big rooms of their corner suite at the Royal Poinciana , where she 'd wanted to go because that was where her father and mother had gone on their weddingtrip , and the flowers friends had sent that filled up the parlor , Gladys threw her arms round his neck and kissed him even before the last bellboy had got out of the room . " Oh , Charley , forgive me for being so horrid . " Next morning they lay happy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked out of the window at the sea beyond the palmtrees , and smelt the freshness of the surf and listened to it pounding along the beach . " Oh , Charley , " Gladys said , " let 's have everythingalways just like this . " Their first child was born in December . It was a boy . They named him Wheatley . When Gladys came back from the hospital instead of coming back to the apartment she went into the new house out at Grosse Pointe that still smelt of paint and raw plaster . What with the hospital expenses and the furniture bills and Christmas , Charley had to borrow twenty thousand from the bank . He spent more time than ever talking over the phone to Nat Benton 's office in New York . Gladys bought a lot of new clothes and kept tiffanyglass bowls full of freesias and narcissus all over the house . Even on the dressingtable in her bathroom she always had flowers . Mrs. Wheatley said she got her love of flowers from her grandmother Randolph , because the Wheatleys had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the next child turned out to be a girl , Gladys said , as she lay in the hospital , her face looking drawn and yellow against the white pillows , beside the great bunch of glittering white orchids Charley had ordered from the florist at five dollars a bloom , she wished she could name her Orchid . They ended by naming her Marguerite after Gladys 's grandmother Randolph . Gladys did n't recover very well after the little girl 's birth and had to have several small operations that kept her in bed three months.  |p245When  she got on her feet she had the big room next to the nursery and the children 's nurse 's room redecorated in white and gold for her own bedroom . Charley groused about it a good deal because it was in the other wing of the house from his room . When he 'd come over in his bathrobe before turning in and try to get into bed with her , she would keep him off with a cool smile , and when he insisted , she would give him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise or he would wake the babies . Sometimes tears of irritation would start into his eyes . " Jesus , Glad , do n't you love me at all ? " She would answer that if he really loved her he 'd have come home the night she had the Smyth Perkinses to dinner instead of phoning at the last minutethat he 'd have to stay at the office . " But , Jesus , Glad , if I did n't make the money how would I pay the bills ? " " If you loved me you 'd be more considerate , that 's all , " she would say and two curving lines would come on her face from her nostrils to the corners of her mouth like the lines on her mother 's face and Charley would kiss her gently and say poor little girl and go back to his room feeling like a louse . Times she did let him stay she lay so cold and still and talked about how he hurt her , so that he would go back to the tester bed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take several stiff whiskies to get him in shape to go to sleep . One night when he 'd taken Bill Cermak , who was now a foreman at the Flint plant , over to a roadhouse the other side of Windsor to talk to him about the trouble they were having with molders and diemakers , after they 'd had a couple of whiskies , Charley found himselfinstead asking Bill about married life . " Say , Bill , do you ever have trouble with your wife ? " " Sure , boss , " said Bill , laughing . " I got plenty trouble . But the old lady 's all right , you know her , nice kids good cook , all time want me to go to church . " " Say , Bill , when did you get the idea of callin ' me boss ? Cut it out . " " Too goddam rich , " said Bill . " S  --  t , have another whiskey . " Charley drank his down . " And beer chasers like in the old days . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City and that blonde at the beerparlor . . . . Jesus , I used to think I was a little devil with the women . . . . But my wife she do n't seem to get the idea . " p 246 " You have two nice kids already ; what the hell , maybe you 're too ambitious . " " You would n't believe it . . . only once since little Peaches was born . " " Most women gets hotter when they 're married a while . . . . That 's why the boys are sore at your damned efficiency expert . " " Stauch ? Stauch 's a genius at production ? ' " Maybe , but he do n't give the boys any chance for reproduction . " Bill laughed and wiped the beer off his mouth . " Good old Bill , " said Charley . " By God , I 'll get you on the board of directors yet . " Bill was n't laughing any more . " Honestly , no kiddin ' . That damn squarehead make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on when they go to bed , an ' their wives raise hell with ' em . I 'm strawboss and they all think sonofabitch too , but they 're right . " Charley was laughing . " You 're a squarehead yourself , Bill , and I do n't know what I can do about it , I 'm just an employee of the companymyself .... We got to have efficient production or they 'll wipe us out of business . Ford 's buildin ' planes now . " " You 'll lose all your best guys . . . . Slavedrivin ' may be all right in the automobile business , but buildin ' an airplane motor 's skilled labor . " " Aw , Christ , I wish I was still tinkerin ' with that damn motor and did n't have to worry about money all the time . . . . Bill , I 'm broke ... . Let 's have another whiskey . " " Better eat . " " Sure , order up a steak . . . anythin ' you like . Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't charge for . . . . Say , Bill , does it seem to you that I 'm gettin ' a potbelly ? . . . Broke , a potbelly , an ' my wife wo n't sleep with me . . . . Do you think I 'm a rummy , Bill ? I sometimes think I better lay off for keeps . I never used to pull a blank when I drank . " " Hell , no , you smart young feller , one of the smartest , a fool for a threepoint landing and a pokerplayer ... my God . " " What 's the use if your wife wo n't sleep with you ? " Charley would n't eat anything . Bill ate up both their steaks . Charleykept on drinking whiskey out of a bottle he had under the table and beer for chasers . " But tell me . . . your wife , does she let you have it any time you want it ? . . . The guys in the shop , their wives wo n't let ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . " My wife she do what I say . " It ended by Bill 's having to drive Charley 's new Packard back to the ferry . In Detroit Bill made Charley drink a lot of sodawater in a drugstore , but when he got back in the car he just slumped down at the wheel . He let Bill drive him home to Grosse Pointe . Charley could hear Bill arguing with the guards along the road , each one really had to see Mr. Anderson passed out in the back of the car before he 'd let Bill through , but he did n't give a hoot , struck him so funny he began to giggle . The big joke was when the houseman had to help Bill get him up to his bedroom . " The boss a little sick , see , overwork , " Bill said each time , then he 'd tap his head solemnly . " Too much brainwork . " Charley came to up in his bedroom and was able to articulate muzzily : " Bill , you 're a prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take Mr. Cermak home . . . lucky bastard go home to his wife . " Then he stretched out on the bed with one shoe on and one shoe off and went quietly to sleep . When he came back from his next trip to New York and Washington , he called up Bill at the plant . " Hay , Bill , how 's the boy ? Your wife still do what you say , ha , ha . Me , I 'm terrible , very exhaustin ' business trip , understand . . . never drank so much in my life or with so many goddam crooks . Say , Bill , do n't worry if you get fired , you 're on my private payroll , understand . . . . We 're goin ' to fire the whole outfit ... . Hell , if they do n't like it workin ' for us let ' em try to like it workin ' for somebody else . . . . This is a free country . I would n't want to keep a man against his will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tune up that little Moth type , you know , number i6 . . . yours truly 's Mosquito ? . . . Check . . . . Well , if we can get her in shape soon enough so they can use her as a model , see , for their specifications .... Jesus , Bill , if we can do that . . . we 're on easystreet . . . . You wo n't have to worry about if the kids can go to college or not . . . goddam it , you an ' the missis can go to college yourselves . . . . Check . " Charley put the receiver back on the desk . His secretary Miss Finnegan was standing in the door . She had red hair and a beautiful complexion with a few freckles round her little sharp nose . She was a snappy dresser . She was looking at Charley with her lightbrown eyes all moist and wide as he was laying down the law over the phone . Charley felt his chest puff out a little . He pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gosh , " he was saying at the back of his head , " maybe I could lay Elsie Finnegan . " Somebody had put a pot of blue hyacinthsp 248on his desk ; a smell of spring came from them that all at once made him remember Bar-le-Duc , and troutfishing up the Red River . It was a flowerysmelling spring morning again when Charley drove out to the plant from the office to give the Anderson Mosquito its trial spin . He had managed to give Elsie Finnegan a kiss for the first time and had left her crumpled and trembling at her desk . Bill Cermak had said over the phone that the tiny ship was tuned up and in fine shape . It was a relief to get out of the office where he 'd been fidgeting for a couple of hours trying to get through a call to Nat Benton 's office about some stock he 'd wired them to take a profit on . After he 'd kissed her he 'd told Elsie Finnegan to switch the call out to the trial field for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the halfbuilt town , through the avenue jammed with trucks full of construction materials , jockeying his car among the trucks with a feeling of shine and strength at the perfect action of his clutch and the smooth response of the gears . The gatekeeper had the New York call for him . The connection was perfect . Nat had banked thirteengrand for him . As he hung up the receiver he thought poor little Elsie , he 'd have to buy her something real nice . " It 's a great day , Joe , ai n't it ? " he said to the gatekeeper . Bill was waiting for him beside the new ship at the entrance to the hangar , wiping grease off his thick fingers with a bunch of waste . Charley slapped him on the back . " Good old Bill .... Is n't this a great day for the race ? " Bill fell for it . " What race , boss ? " " The human race , you fathead . . . . Say , Bill , " he went on as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I do n't mind tellin ' you I feel wonderful today . . . made thirteen grand on the market yesterday . . . easy as rollin ' off a log . " While Charley pulled a suit of overalls on the mechanics pushed the new ship out onto the grass for Bill to make his general inspection . " Jesus , she 's pretty . " The tiny aluminum ship glistened in the sun out on the green grass like something in a jeweler 's window . There were dandelions and clover on the grass and a swirling flight of little white butterflies went up right from under his black clodhopperswhen Bill came back to Charley and stood beside him . Charley winked at Bill Cermak standing beside him in his blue denims stolidlylooking at his feet . " Smile , you sonofabitch , " he said . " Do n't this weather make you feel good ? " Bill turned a square bohunk face towards Charley . " Now look here , p 249Mr . Anderson , you always treat me good . . . from way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , go home , keep my face shut . " " What 's on your mind , Bill ? ... Want me to try to wangle another raise for you ? Check . " Bill shook his heavy square face and rubbed his nose with a black forefinger . " Tern Company used to be good place to work good work good pay . You know me , Mr. Anderson , I 'm no bolshayvik . . . but no stoolpigeon either . " " But damn it , Bill , why ca n't you tell those guys to have a little patience . . . we 're workin ' out a profitsharin ' scheme . I 've worked on a lathe myself . . . . I 've worked as a mechanic all over this goddam country . . . . I know what the boys are up against , but I know what the management 's up against too . . . . Gosh , this thing 's in its infancy , we 're pouring more capital into the business all the time . . . . We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that jack I made yesterday 's goin ' but the business of course . The oldtime shop was a great thing , everybody kidded and smoked and told smutty stories , but the pressure 's too great now . If every departmentdo n't click like a machine we 're rooked . If the boys want a union we 'll give ' em a union . You get up a meeting and tell ' em how we feel about it but tell ' em we 've got to have some patriotism . Tell ' em the industry 's the first line of national defense . We 'll send Eddy Sawyer down to talk to ' em . . . make ' em understand our problems . " Bill Cermak shook his head . " Plenty other guys do that . " Charley frowned . " Well , let 's see how she goes , " he snapped impatiently . " Gosh , she 's a honey . " The roar of the motor kept them from saying any more . The mechanic stepped from the controls and Charley climbed in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the green field . Charley turned her into the wind and let her have the gas . At the first soaring bounce there was a jerk . As he pitched forward Charley switched off the ignition . They were carrying him across the field on a stretcher . Each step of the men carrying the stretcher made two jagged things grind together in his leg . He tried to tell ' em that he had a piece of something in his side , but his voice was very small and hoarse . In the shadow of the hangar he was trying to raise himself on his elbow . " What the devil happened ? Is Bill all right ? " The men shook their heads . Then he passed out again like the juice failing in a car. p 250In the ambulance he tried to ask the man in the white jacket about Bill Cermak and to remember back exactly what had happened , but the leg kept him too busy trying not to yell . " Hay , doc , " he managed to croak , " ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The damn ship must have turned turtle on them . Wing could n't take it maybe , but it 's time they got the motor lifted off me . Hay , doc , why ca n't they get a move on ? " When he got the first whiff of the hospital , there were a lot of men in white jackets moving and whispering round him . The hospital smelt strong of ether . The trouble was he could n't breathe . Somebody must have spilt that damned ether . No , not on my face . The motor roared . He must have been seeing things . The motor 's roar swung into an easy singsong . Sure , she was taking it fine , steady as one of those big old bombers . When he woke up a nurse was helping him puke into a bowl . When he woke up again , for chrissake no more ether , no , it was flowers , and Gladys was standing beside the bed with a big bunch of sweetpeas in her hand . Her face had a pinched look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Oh , I 've been so worried , Charley . How do you feel ? Oh , Charley , for a man of your standing to risk his life in practice flights . . . Why do n't you let the people whose business it is do it , I declare . " There was something Charley wanted to ask . He was scared about something . " Say , are the kids all right ? " " Wheatley skinned his knee and I 'm afraid the baby has a little temperature . I 've phoned Dr. Thompson . I do n't think it 's anything though . " " Is Bill Cermak all right ? " Gladys 's mouth trembled . " Oh , yes , " she said , cutting the words off sharply . " Well , I suppose this means our dinnerdance is off .... The Edsel Fords were coming . " " Hell , no , why not have it anyway ? Yours truly can attend in a wheelchair . Say , they sure have got me in a straitjacket .... I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth was getting very small and thin . Then she suddenly began to cry . The nurse came in and said reproachfully , " Oh , Mrs. Anderson . " Charley was just as glad when Gladys went out and left him alone with the nurse . " Say , nurse , get hold of the doctor , will you ? Tell him I 'm feeling fine and want to look over the extent of the damage . " " Mr. Anderson , you must n't have anything on your mind . " " I know , tell Mrs. Anderson I want her to get in touch with the office . " " But it'sp 251Sunday , Mr. Anderson . A great many people have been downstairs but I do n't think the doctor is letting them up yet ? ' The nurse was a freshfaced girl with a slightly Scotch way of talking . " I bet you 're a Canadian , " said Charley . " Right that time , " said the nurse . " I knew a wonderful nurse who was a Canadian once . If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The housephysician was a roundfaced man with a jovial smooth manner almost like a headwaiter at a big hotel . " Say , doc , ought my leg to hurt so damn much ? " " You see we have n't set it yet . You tried to puncture a lung but did n't quite get away with it . We had to remove a few little splinters of rib . " " Not from the lung . . . " " Luckily not ? ' " But why the hell did n't you set the leg at the same time ? " " Well , we 're waiting for Dr. Roberts to come on from New York .... Mrs. Andersoninsisted on him . Of course we are all very pleased , as he 's one of the most eminent men in his profession . . . . It 'll be another little operation . " It was n't until he 'd come to from the second operation that they told him that Bill Cermak had died of a fractured skull . Charley was in the hospital three months with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healed up fast , but he kept on having trouble with his breathing . Gladys handled all the house bills and came every afternoon for a minute . She was always in a hurry and always terribly worried . He had to turn over a power of attorney to Moe Frank his lawyer who used to come to see him a couple of times a week to talk things over . Charley could n't say much , he could n't say much to anybody he was in so much pain . He liked it best when Gladys sent Wheatley to see him . Wheatley was three years old now and thought it was great in the hospital . He liked to see the nurse working all the little weights and pulleys of the frame the leg hung in . " Daddy 's living in a airplane , " was what he always said about it . He had tow hair and his nose was beginning to stick up and Charley thought he took after him . Marguerite was still too little to be much fun . The one time Gladys had the governess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scarylookingframe she had to be taken home . Gladys would n't let her come again . Gladys and Charley had a bitter row about letting Wheatley come as she said she did n't want the child to remember his father in the hospital . " But , Glad , he 'll have plenty of time to get overp 252it , get over it a damn sight sooner than I will . " Gladys pursed her lips together and said nothing . When she 'd gone Charley lay there hating her and wondering how they could ever have had children together . Just about the time he began to see clearly that they all expected him to be a cripple the rest of his life he began to mend , but it was winter before he was able to go home on crutches . He still suffered sometimes from a sort of nervous difficulty in breathing . The house seemed strange as he dragged himself around in it . Gladys had had every room redecorated while he was away and all the servants were different . Charley did n't feel it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the massage he had three times a week . He spent his days playing with the kids and talking to Miss Jarvis , their stiff and elderly English governess . After they 'd gone to bed he 'd sit in his sittingroom drinking scotch and soda and feeling puffy and nervous . God damn it , he was getting too fat . Gladys was always cool as a cucumber these days ; even when he went into fits of temper and cursed at her , she 'd stand there looking at him with a cold look of disgust on her carefully madeup face . She entertained a great deal but made the servants understand that Mr. Anderson was n't well enough to come down . He began to feel like a poor relation in his own house . Once when the Farrells were coming he put on his tuxedo and hobbled down to dinneron his crutches . There was no place set for him and everybody looked at him like he was a ghost . " Thataboy , " shouted Farrell in his yapping voice . " I was expecting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It turned out that what Farrell wanted to talk about was the suit for five hundred thousand some damn shyster had induced Cermak 's widow to bring against the company . Farrell had an idea that if Charley went and saw her he could induce her to be reasonable and settle for a small annuity . Charley said he 'd be damned if he 'd go . At dinner Charley got tight and upset the afterdinner coffeecups with his crutch and went off to bed in a rage . What he enjoyed outside of playing with the kids was buying and selling stocks and talking to Nat over the longdistance . Nat kept tellinghim he was getting the feel of the market . Nat warned him and Charley knew damn well that he was slipping at Tern and that if he did n't do something he 'd be frozen out , but he felt too rotten to go to directors ' meetings ; what he did do was to sell out about half hisp253stocks in small parcels . Nat kept telling him if he 'd only get a move on he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled off his new reorganization , but he felt too damn nervous and miseraHeto make the effort . All he could seem to do was to grumble and call Julius Stauch and raise hell about details . Stauch had taken over his work on the new monoplane and turned out a little ship that had gone through all tests with flying colors . When he 'd put down the receiver , Charley would pour himself a little scotch and settle back on the couch in his window and mutter to himself , " Well , you 're dished this time : ' One evening Farrell came around and had a long talk and said what Charley needed was a fishing trip , he 'd never get well if he kept on this way . He said he 'd been talking to Doc Thompson and that he recommended three months off and plenty of exercise if he ever expected to throw away his crutches . Gladys could n't go because old Mrs. Wheatley was sick , so Charley got into the back of his Lincoln towncar alone with the chauffeur to drive him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a flask of whiskey and a thermosbottle of hot coffee , to go down all alone to Miami . At Cincinnati he felt so bum he spent a whole day in bed in the hotelthere . He got the chauffeur to get him booklets about Florida from a travel agency , and finally sent a wire to Nat Benton asking him to spend a week with him down at the Key Largo fishingcamp . Next morning he started off again early . He 'd had a good night 's sleep and he felt better and began to enjoy the trip . But he felt a damn fool sitting there being driven like an old woman all bundled up in rugs . He was lonely too because the chauffeur was n't the kind of bird you could talk to . He was a sourlooking Canuck Gladys had hired because she thought it was classy to give her orders in French through the speakingtube ; Charley was sure the bastard gypped him on the price of gas and oil and repairs along the road ; that damn Lincoln was turning out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun was shining . Charley gave himself the satisfaction of firing the chauffeur as soon as they 'd driven up to the door of the hotel . Then he went to bed with a pint of bum corn the bellboy sold him and slept like a log . In the morning he woke up late feeling thirsty but cheerful . Afterp254breakfast he checked out of the hotel and drove around the town a little . It made him feel good to pack his own bag and get into the front seat and drive his own car . The town had a cheerful rattletrap look in the sunlight under the big white clouds and the blue sky . At the lunchroom next to the bus station he stopped to have a drink . He felt so good that he got out of the car without his crutches and hobbled across the warm pavement . The wind was fluttering the leaves of the magazines and the pink and palegreen sheets of the papers outside the lunchroom window . Charley was out of breath from the effort when he slid onto a stool at the counter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it , please , " he said to the ratfaced boy at the fountain . The sodajerker did n't pay any attention , he was looking down the other way . Charley felt his face get red . His first idea was , I 'll get him fired . Then he looked where the boy was looking . There was a blonde eating a sandwich at the other end of the counter . She certainly was pretty . She wore a little black hat and a neat bluegrey suit and a little white lace around her neck and at her wrists . She had an amazed look on her face like she 'd just heard something extraordinarily funny . Forgetting to favor his game leg Charley slipped up several seats towards her . " Say , bo , how about that limeade ? " he shouted cheerfully at the sodajerker . The girl was looking at Charley . Her eyes really were a perfectly pure blue . She was speaking to him . " Maybe you know how long the bus takes to Miami , mister . This boy thinks he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Suppose we try it out and see , " said Charley . " They surely come funny in Florida . . . . Another humorist . " " No , I mean it . If you let me drive you down you 'll be doing a sick You 'll be perfectly safe with me , young lady . I 'm almost a cripple . I 'll show you my crutches in the car . " " What 's the trouble ? " " Cracked up in a plane . " " You a pilot ? " Charley nodded . " Not quite skinny enough for Lindbergh , " she said , looking him up and down . Charley turned red . " I am a little overweight . It 's being cooped up with this lousy leg . " p 255 " Well , I guess I 'll try it . If I step into your car and wake up in BuenosAires it 'll be my bad luck . " Charley tried to pay for her coffee and sandwich but she would n't let him . Something about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got up and she saw how he limped she pursed her mouth up . " Gee , that 's too bad . " When she saw the car she stopped in her t racks . " Zowie , " she said , " we 're bloomin ' millionaires . " They were laughing as they got into the car . There was something about the way she said things that made him laugh . She would n't say what her name was . " Call me Mme. X , " she said . " Then you 'll have to call me Mr. A , " said Charley . They laughed and giggled all the way to Daytona Beach where they stopped off and went into the surf for a dip . Charley felt ashamed of his pot and his pale skin and his limp as he walked across the beach with her looking brown and trim in her blue bathingsuit . She had a pretty figure although her hips were a little big . " Anyway it 's not as if 1 'd come out of it with one leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be absolutely O.K. if I exercise it right . " " Sure , you 'll be great in no time . And me thinkin ' you was an elderlysugardaddy in the drugstore there . " " I think you 're a humdinger , Mme. X. " " Be sure you do n't put anything in writing , Mr. A. " Charley 's leg ached like blazes when he came out of the water , but it did n't keep him from having a whale of a good appetite for the first time in months . After a big fishdinner they started off again . She went to sleep in the car with her neat little head on his shoulder . He felt very happy driving down the straight smooth concrete highway although he felt tired already . When they got into Miami that night she made him take her to a small hotel back near the railroad tracks and would n't let him come in with her . " But gosh , could n't we see each other again ? " " Sure , you can see me any night at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honest . . . I knew you were an entertainer but I did n't know you were a professional . " " You sure did me a good turn , Mr. A. Now it can be told ... I was flat broke with exactly the price of that ham sandwich and if you had n't brought me down I'da lost the chance of working here .... I 'll tell you about it sometime . " p 256 " Tell me your name . I 'd like to call you up . " " You tell me yours . " " Charles Anderson . I 'll be staying bored to death at the Miami-Biltmore . " " So you really are Mr. A. . . . Well , goodby , Mr. A , and thanks a milliontimes . " She ran into the hotel . Charley was crazy about her already . He was so tired he just barely made his hotel . He went up to his room and tumbled into bed and for the first time in months went to sleep without getting drunk first . A week later when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such good shape . " Nothin ' like a change , " said Charley , laughing . They drove on down towards the Keys together . Charley had Margo Dowling 's photograph in his pocket , a professional photographof her dressed in Spanish costume for her act . He 'd been to the Palms every night , but he had n't managed to get her to go out with him yet . When he 'd suggest anything she 'd shake her head and make a face and say , " I 'll tell you about it sometime . " But the last night she had given him a number where he could call her up . Nat kept trying to talk about the market and the big reorganization of Tern and Askew-Merritt that Merritt was engineering but Charley would shut him up with , " Aw , hell , let 's talk about somethin ' else . " The camp was all right but the mosquitoes were fierce . They spent a good day on the reef fishing for barracuda and grouper . They took a jug of bacardi out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Charley told Nat all about the crackup . " Honestly , I do n't think it was my fault . It was one of those damn things you ca n't help . . . . Now I feel as if I 'd lost the last friend I had on earth . Honest , I 'd a given anythin ' I had in the world if that had n't happened to Bill : ' " After all , " said Nat , " he was only a mechanic . " One day when they got in from fishing , drunk and with their hands and pants fishy , and their faces burned by the sun and glare , and dizzy from the sound and smell of the motor and the choppy motion of the boat , they found waiting for them a wire from Benton 's office . UNKNOWN UNLOADING TERN STOP DROPS FOUR AND A HALF POINTS STOP WIRE INSTRUCTIONS " Instructions hell , " said Benton , jamming his stuff into his suitcase . " We 'll go up and see . Suppose we charter a plane at Miami @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charley coolly . " I 'm going to ride on the train . " In New York he sat all day in the back room of Nat Benton 's officep 257smoking too many cigars , watching the ticker , fretting and fuming , riding up and down town in taxicabs , getting the lowdown from varioussallowfaced friends of Nat 's and Moe Frank 's . By the end of the week he 'd lost four hundred thousand dollars and had let go every airplane stock he had in the world . All the time he was sitting there putting on a big show of business he was counting the minutes , the way he had when he was a kid in school , for the market to close so that he could go uptown to a speakeasyon Fiftysecond Street to meet a hennahaired girl named Sally I logan he 'd met when he was out with Nat at the Club Dover . She was the first girl he 'd picked up when he got to New York . He did n't give a damn about her but he had to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hotel as Mr. and Mrs. Smith . One morning when they were having breakfast in bed there was a light knock on the door . " Come in , " yelled Charley , thinking it was the waiter . Two shabbylooking men rushed into the room , followed by O'Higgins , a shyster lawyer he 'd met a couple of times back in Detroit . Sally let out a shriek and covered her head with the pillow . " Howdy , Charley , " said O'Higgins . " I 'm sorry to do this but it 's all in the line of duty . You do n't deny that you are Charles Anderson , do you ? Well , I thought you 'd rather hear it from me than just read the legal terms . Mrs. Anderson is suing you for divorce in Michigan ... . That 's all right , boys . " The shabby men bowed meekly and backed out the door . " Of all the lousy stinkin ' tricks ... " " Mrs. Anderson 's had the detectives on your trail ever since you fired her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headache and felt so weak from a hangover that he could n't lift his head . He wanted to get up and sock that sonofabitch O'Higgins but all he could do was lie there and take it . " But she never said anything about it in her letters . She 's been writin ' me right along . There 's never been any trouble between us . " O'Higgins shook his curly red head . " Too bad , " he said . " Maybe if you can see her you can arrange it between you . You know my advice about these things is always keep ' em out of court . Well , I 'm heartily sorry , old boy , to have caused you and your charming friend any embarrassment . . . no hard feelings I hope , Charley old man . . . . I thought it would be pleasanter more open and aboveboard if I came along if you saw a friendly face , as you might say . I 'm sure this can allp 258be amicably settled . " He stood there a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . Standing there with one hand on the doorknob he waved the other big flipper towards the bed . " Well , so long , Sally . . . . Guess I 'll be seein ' you down at the office . " Then he closed the door softly after him . Sally had jumped out of bed and was running towards the door with a terrified look on her face . Charley began to laugh in spite of his splitting headache . " Aw , never mind , girlie , " he said . " Serves me right for bein ' a sucker . . . . I know we all got our livin 's to make . . . . Come on back to bed . "  |p258Was  Celine to blame ? To young Scotty marriage seemed just a lark , a wild time in good standing .

But she sure found her work cut out for her . The Mandevilles were in a bad way . Frank had spent three months in the hospital and had had one kidney removed in an operation . When he got home he was still so sick that Agnes gave up her position to stay home and nurse him ; she and Frank had taken up Science and would n't have the doctor any more . They talked all the time about having proper thoughts and about how Frank 's life had been saved by Miss Jenkins , a practitioner Agnes had met at her tearoom . They owed five hundred dollars in doctor'sp 261bills and hospital expenses , and talked about God all the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very rich man . Mr. A , as she called him , kept offering to set Margo up in an apartment on Park Avenue , but she always said nothing doing , what did he think she was , a kept woman ? She did let him play the stockmarket alittle for her , and buy her clothes and jewelry and take her to AtlanticCity and Long Beach weekends . He 'd been an airplane pilot and decoratedin the war and had big investments in airplane companies . He drank more than was good for him ; he was a beefy florid guy who looked older than he was , a big talker , and hard to handle when he 'd been drinking , but he was openhanded and liked laughing and jokes when he was feeling good . Margo thought he was a pretty good egg . " Anyway , what can you do when a guy picks up a telephone and turns over a thousand dollars for you ? " was what she 'd tell Agnes when she wanted to tease her . " Margie dear , you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It sounds so mercenary . " Agnes talked an awful lot about love and right thoughts and being true and good these days . Margo liked better to hear Mr. Anderson blowing about his killings on the stockmarket and the planes he 'd designed , and how he was going to organize a net of airways that would make the Pennsylvania Railroad look like a suburban busline . Evening after evening she 'd have to sit with him in speakeasies in the Fifties drinking whiskey and listening to him talk about this businessand that and big deals in stocks down on the Street , and about how he was out to get that Detroit crowd that was trying to ease him out of Standard Airparts and about his divorce and how much it was costing him . One night at the Stork Club , when he was showing her pictures of his kids , he broke down and started to blubber . The court had just awarded the custody of the children to his wife . Mr. A had his troubles all right . One of the worst was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his wife 's detectives who was all the time blackmailing him , and threatening to sue for breach of promise and give the whole story to the Hearst papers . " Oh , how awful , " Agnes would keep saying , when Margo would tell her about it over a cup of coffee at noon . " If he only had the right thoughts . . . . You must talk to him and make him try and see . . . . If he only understoodI know everything would be different . . . . A successful man like that should be full of right thoughts . " p 262 " Full of Canadian Club , that 's what 's the matter with him . . . . You ought to see the trouble I have getting him home nights . " " You 're the only friend he has , " Agnes would say , rolling up her eyes . " I think it 's noble of you to stick by him . " Margo was paying all the back bills up at the apartment and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be on the safe side . She felt she was getting the hang of the stockmarket a little . Still it made her feel trashy not working and it gave her the creeps sittingaround in the apartment summer afternoons while Agnes read Frank Science and Health in a singsong voice , so she started going around the dress shops to see if she could get herself a job as a model . " I want to learn some more about clothes . . . mine always look like they were made of old floursacks , " she explained to Agnes . " Are you sure Mr. Anderson wo n't mind ? " " If he do n't like it he can lump it , " said Margo , tossing her head . In the fall they finally took her on at Piquot 's new French gownshopon Fiftyseventh Street . It was tiresome work but it left her eveningsfree . She confided to Agnes that if she ever let Mr. A out of her sight in the evening some little floosey or other would get hold of him sure as fate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show business . " I never felt it was right for you to do that sort of thing and now I feel you can be a real power for good with poor Mr. Anderson , " Agnes said . Whenever Margo told them about a new plunger he had taken on the market , Agnes and Frank would hold the thought for Mr. Anderson . Jules Piquot was a middleaged roundfaced Frenchman with a funny waddle like a duck who thought all the girls were crazy about him . He took a great fancy to Margo , or maybe it was that he 'd found out somewhere that her protector , as he called it , was a millionaire . He said she must always keep that beautiful golden tan and made her wear her hair smooth on her head instead of in the curls she 'd worn it in since she had been a Follies girl . " Vat is te use to make beautiful clothes for American women if tey look so healty like from milkin ' a cow ? " he said . " Vat you need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he struck himself with a pudgy ringed fist on the bosom of his silk pleated shirt . " It is drama . . . . In America all you care about is te perfecttirtysix . " " Oh , I guess you think we 're very unrefined , " said Margo . " If I onlyp 263some capital , " groaned Piquot , shaking his head as he went back his office on the mezzanine that was all glass and eggshellwhite th aluminum fittings . " I could make New York to most stylish city tr vorld . " Margo liked it parading around in the Paris models and in Piquot'sin slinky contraptions over the deep puttycolored rugs . It wasbetter than shaking her fanny in the chorus all right . She did n't haveto get down to the showrooms till late . The showrooms were warmand spotless , with a faint bitter smell on the air of new materials anddyes and mothballs , shot through with a whiff of scented Egyptian cigarettes . The models had a little room in the back where they could sit and read magazines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season , when there were no customers . There were only two other girls who came regularly and there were n't too many customers either . The girls said that Piquot was going broke . When he had his sale after Christmas Margo got Agnes to go down one Monday morning and buy her three stunning gowns for thirty dollars each ; she tipped Agnes off on just what to buy and made out not to know her when she pranced out to show the new spring models off . There was n't any doubt any more that Piquot was going broke . Rillcollectors stormed in the little office on the mezzanine and everybody'spay was three weeks in arrears , and Piquot 's moonshaped face drooped in tiny sagging wrinkles . Margo decided she 'd better start looking around for another job , especially as Mr. A 's drinking was getting harder and harder to handle . Every morning she studied the stockmarket reports . She did n't have the faith she had at first in Mr. A 's tips after she 'd bought Sinclair one day and had had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hole . One Saturday there was a great stir around Piquot 's . Piquot himselfkept charging out of his office waving his short arms , sometimes peevish and sometimes cackling and giggling , driving the salesladies and models before him like a new rooster in a henyard . Somebody was coming to take photographs for Vogue . The photographer when he finally came was a thin-faced young Jewish boy with a pasty skin and dark circles under his eyes . He had a regular big photographer'scamera and a great many flashlight bulbs all silvercrinkly insidethat Piquot kept picking up and handling in a gingerly kind ofp 264way and exclaiming over . " A vonderful invention . . . . I vould never ' ave photographs taken before because I detest explosions and ten to danger of fire . " It was a warm day in February and the steamheated showrooms were stifling hot . The young man who came to take the pictures was drenched in sweat when he came out from under the black cloth . Piquot would n't leave him alone for a second . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draftingboard , Piquot among the models . The girls thought their turn would never come . The photographerkept saying , " You let me alone , Mr. Piquot .... I want to plan something artistic . " The girls all got to giggling . At last Piquot went off and locked himself in his office in a pet . They could see him in there through the glass partition , sitting at his desk with his head in his hands . After that things quieted down . Margo and the photographergot along very well . He kept whispering to her to see what she could do to keep the old gent out of the pictures . When he left to go up to the loft upstairs where the dresses were made , the photographer handed her his card and asked her if she would n't let him take her picture at his studio some Sunday . It would mean a great deal to him and it would n't cost her anything . He was sure he could get somethingdistinctively artistic . She took his card and said she 'd be around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Art Photographer . That Sunday Mr. A took her out to lunch at the Hotel Pennsylvania and afterwards she managed to get him to drive her over to Margolies ' studio . She guessed the young Jewish boy was n't so well off and thought Mr. A might just as well pay for a set of photographs . Mr. A was sore about going because he 'd gotten his big car out and wanted to take her for a drive up the Hudson . Anyway he went . It was funny in Margolies ' studio . Everything was hung with black velvet and there were screens of different sizes in black and white and yellow and green and silver standing all over the big dusty room under the grimy skylights . The young man acted funny too , as if he had n't expected them . " All this is over , " he said . " This is my brother Lee 's studio . I 'm attending to his clientele while he 's abroad . . . . My interests are in the real art of the future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grumpily clipping the end off a cigar as he looked around for a place to sit down . " Motionpictures . You see I 'm Sam Margolies . . . . You 'll hear of me if you have n't yet . " p 265Mr . A sat down grouchily on a dusty velvet modelstand . " Well , Make it snappy . . . . We want to go driving " tiara Margolies seemed sore because Margo had just come in her treetclothes . He looked her over with his petulant grey eyes for a long time . " I may not be able to do anything . . . I ca n't create if I 'm urried .... I had seen you stately in Spanish black . " Margo laughed. ' m not exactly the type . " " The type for a small infanta by Velasquez . " He had a definite foreignaccent when he spoke earnestly . " Well , I was married to a Spaniardonce . . . . That was enough of Spanish grandees and all that kind of thing to last me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam Margolies , walkingall round her . " I see it , first in streetclothes and then . . . " He ranout of the room and came back with a black lace shawl . " An infanta in the court of old Spain . " " You do n't know what it 's like to be married to one , " said Margo . " And to live in a house full of noble spick relatives . " While Sam Margolies was posing her in her streetclothes Mr. A Was walking up and down fidgeting with his cigar . It must have been getting cloudy out because the overhead skylight grew darker and darker . When Sam Margolies turned the floodlights on her the skylightwent blue , like on the stage . Then when he got to posing her in the Spanish shawl and made her take her things off and let her undies down so that she had nothing on but the shawl above the waist , she noticed that Mr. A had let his cigar go out and was watching intently . The reflection from the floodlight made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they were walking down the gritty wooden stairs from the studio , Mr. A said , " I do n't like that guy . . . makes me think of a pimp . " " Oh , no , it 's just that he 's very artistic , " said Margo . " How much ( lid he say the photographs were ? " " Plenty , " said Mr. A.In the unlighted hall that smelt of cabbage cooking somewhere , he grabbed her to him and kissed her . Through the glass front door she could see a flutter of snow in the street that was empty under the lamps . " Aw , to hell with him , " he said , stretching his fingers out across the small of her back . " You 're a great little girl , do you know it ? Gosh . I like this house . It makes me think of the old days . " Margo shook her head and blinked . " Too bad about our drive , " shep 266said . " It 's snowing . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and me act like we was fond of each other for tonight at least . . . . First we 'll go to the Meadowbrook and have a little bite to drink . . . . Jesus , I wish I 'd met you before I got in on the dough , when I was livin ' in bedbug alley and all that sort of thing . " She let her head drop on his chest for a moment . " Charley , you 're number one , " she whispered . That night he got Margo to say that when Agnes took Frank out to his sister 's house in New Jersey like she was planning , to try if a little country air would n't do him good , she 'd go and live with him . " If you knew how I was sick of this hellraisin ' kind of life , " he told her . She looked straight up in his boiled blue eyes . " Do you think I like it , Mr. A ? " She was fond of Charley Anderson that night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day , at the apartment and at Piquot 's , and sent her photographs of herself all framed for hanging but she would never see him . She had enough to think of , what with being alone in the apartment now , because Agnes had finally got Frank away to the country with the help of a practitioner and a great deal of reading of Science and Health , and all the bills to pay and daily letters from Tony who 'd found out her addresssaying he was sick and begging for money and to be allowed to come around to see her . Then one Monday morning she got down to Piquot 's late and found the door locked and a crowd of girls milling shrilly around in front of it . Poor Piquot had been found dead in his bathtub from a dose of cyanide of potassium and there was nobody to pay their back wages . Piquot 's being dead gave Margo the creeps so that she did n't dare go home . She went down to Altman 's and did some shopping and at noon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Piquot and to see if he would n't have lunch with her . With poor old Piquot dead and her job gone , there was nothing to do but to strike Mr. A for a lump sum . About two grand would fix her up , and she could get her solitaire diamondTad had given her out of hock . Maybe if she teased him he would put her up to something good on the market . When she called up they said Mr. Anderson would n't be in his office until three . She went to Schrafft 's and had chickenpatties for lunch all by herself in the middle of the crowd of cackling women shoppers . She already had a date to meet Mr. A that evening at a Frenchp 267speakeasy on Fiftysecond Street where they often ate dinner . When she got back from having her hair washed and waved it was too early to get dressed but she started fiddling around with her clothes anyway because she did n't know what else to do , and it was so quiet and lonely in the empty apartment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started trying on one dress after another . Her bed got all piled with rumpled dresses . Everything seemed to have spots on it . She was almost crying when she at last slipped her furcoat over a paleyellow eveningdress that had come from Piquot 's but that she was n't sure about , and went down in the shabby elevator into the smelly hallway of the apartmenthouse . The elevator-boy fetched her a taxi . There were white columns in the hall of the oldfashioned wealthy family residence converted into a restaurant , and a warm expensive pinkish glow of shaded lights . She felt cozier than she 'd felt all day as she stepped in on the thick carpet . The headwaiter bowed her to a tableand she sat there sipping an oldfashioned , feeling the men in the room looking at her and grinning a little to herself when she thought what the girls at Piquot 's would have said about a dame who got to a date with the boyfriend ahead of time . She wished he 'd hurry up and come , so that she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Piquot must have looked slumped down in his bathtub , dead from cyanide . It was all on the tip of her tongue ready to tell . Instead of Mr. A a freshlooking youngster with a long sandy head and a lantern jaw was leaning over her table . She straightened herself in her chair to give him a dirty look , but smiled up at him when he leaned over and said in a Brooklyn confidential kind of voice , " Miss I ) owlin ' . . . excuse it ... I 'm Mr. Anderson 's secretary . He had to hop the plane to Detroit on important business . He knew you were crazy to go to the Music Box opening , so he sent me out to get tickets . Here they are , I pretty near had to blackjack a guy to get ' em for you . The boss said maybe you 'd like to take Mrs. Mandeville . " He had been talking fast , like he was afraid she 'd shut him up ; he drew a deep breath and smiled . Margo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tablecloth . " What a shame . . . I do n't know who I could get to go now , it 's so late . She 's in the country . " " My , that 's too bad . . . . I do n't suppose I could pinchhit for the boss ? " p 268 " Of all the gall . . . " she began ; then suddenly she found herself laughing . " But you 're not dressed . " " Leave it to me , Miss Dowlin .... You eat your supper and I 'll come back in a soup an ' fish and take you to the show . " Promptly at eight there he was back with his hair slicked , wearing a rustylooking dinnerjacket that was too short in the sleeves . When they got in the taxi she asked him if he 'd hijacked a waiter and he put his hand over his mouth and said , " Do n't say a woid , Miss Dowlin ' .. . it 's hired . " Between the acts , he pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her that his name was Clifton Wegman and that everybody called him Cliff and that he was twentythree years old and could play the mandolin and was a little demon with pocket billiards . " Well , Cliff , you 're a likely lad , " she said . " Likely to succeed ? " " I 'll tell the world . " " A popular graduate of the New York School of Business . . . opportunitieswanted . " They had the time of their lives together . After the show Cliff said he was starved , because he had n't had his supper , what with chasing the theatertickets and the tuck and all , and she took him to the Club Dover to have a bite to eat . He surely had an appetite . It was a pleasure to see him put away a beefsteak with mushrooms . They had some drinks there and laughed their heads off at the floorshow , and , when he tried to get fresh in the taxicab , she slapped his face , but not very hard . That kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her door , he said could he come up and before she could stop herself she 'd said yes , if he acted like a gentleman . He said that was n't so easy with a girl like her but he 'd try and they were laughing and scuffling so in front of her door she dropped her key . They both stooped to pick it up . When she got to her feet flushing from the kiss he 'd given her , she noticed that the man sitting all hunched up on the stairs beside the elevator was Tony . " Well , goodnight , Cliff , thanks for seeing a poor little workinggirl home , " Margo said cheerily . Tony got to his feet and staggered over towards the open door of the apartment . His face had a green pallor and his clothes looked like he 'd lain in the gutter all night.  | " This is Tony , " said Margo . " He 's a . . . a relative of mine ... not in wry good repair . " Cliff looked from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked down the stairs . " Well , now you can tell me what you mean by hanging around my place .... I 've a great mind to have you arrested for a burglar . " ' limy could hardly talk . His lip was bloody and all puffed up . " No place to go , " he said . " A gang beat me up . " He was teetering so she had to grab the sleeve of his filthy overcoat to keep him from falling . " Oh , ' limy , " she said , " you sure are a mess . Come on in , but if you pull any tricks like you did last time ... I swear to God I 'll break every bone in your body . " She put him to bed . Next morning he was so jittery she had to send for a doctor . The sawbones said he was suffering from dope and exposure and suggested a cure in a sanatorium . Tony lay in bed white and trembling . He cried a great deal , but he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd do anything the doctor said . Once he grabbed her hand and kissed it and begged her to forgive him for having stolenher money so that he could die happy . " You wo n't die , not you , " said Margo , smoothing the stiff black hair off his forehead with her free hand . " No such luck . " She went out for a little walk on the Drive to try to decide what to do . The dizzysweet clinging smell of the paraldehyde the doctor had given Tony for a sedative had made her feel sick . At the end of the week when Charley Anderson came back from Detroit and met her at the place on Fiftysecond Street for dinner , he looked worried and haggard . She came out with her sad story and he did n't take it so well . He said he was hard up for cash , that his wife had everything tied up on him , that he 'd had severe losses on the market ; he could raise five hundred dollars for her but he 'd have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said she guessed she 'd have to go back to her old engagement as entertainer at the Palms at Miami and he said , swell , if she did n't look out he 'd come down there and let her support him . " I do n't know why everybody 's got to thinkin ' I 'm a lousy millionaire . All I want is to get out of the whole business with enough jack to let me settle down to work on motors . If it had n't been for this sonofabitchin ' divorce I 'd been out long ago . This winter I expect to clean up and get out . I 'm only a dumb mechanicanyway. " p 270 " You want to get out and I want to get in , " said Margo , looking him straight in the eye . They both laughed together . " Aw , let 's go up to your place , since the folks are away . I 'm tired of these lousy speakeasies . " She shook her head , still laughing . " It 's swarming with Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go there . " They got a bag at his hotel and went over to Brooklyn in a taxi , to a hotel where they were wellknown as Mr. and Mrs. Dowling . On the way over in the taxi she managed to get the ante raised to a thousand . Next day she took Tony to a sanatorium up in the Catskills . He did everything she said like a good little boy and talked about getting a job when he got out and about honor and manhood . When she got back to town she called up the office and found that Mr. A was back in Detroit , but he 'd left instructions with his secretary to get her her ticket and a drawingroom and fix up everything about the trip to Miami . She closed up her apartment and the office attended to storing the furniture and the packing and everything . When she went down to the train there was Cliff waiting to meet her with his wiseguy grin and his hat on the back of his long thin head . " Why , this certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some lilies of the valley Cliff had brought her to her furcoat as two redcaps rushed forward to get her bags . " Sweet of who ? " Cliff whispered . " Of the boss or of me ? " There were roses in the drawingroom , and Cliff had bought her Theatre and Variety and Zit 's Weekly and Town Topics and Shadowland . " My , this is grand , " she said . He winked . " The boss said to send you off in the best possiblestyle . " He brought a bottle out of his overcoat pocket . " That 's Teacher 's Highland Cream . . . . Well , so long . " He made a little bow and went off down the corridor . Margo settled herself in the drawingroom and almost wished Cliff had n't gone so soon . He might at least have taken longer to say goodby . My , that boy was fresh . The train had no sooner started when there he was back , with his hands in his pants pockets , looking anxiousand chewing gum at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , frowning , " now what ?

" Cliff took his coat off , folded it carefully and laid it on the rack , then he sat down opposite her and pulled the door of the drawingroomto . " Not unless you tell him . " She started to get to her feet . " Well , of all the fresh kids . " He went on in the same tone of voice . " And you wo n't tell him and I wo n't tell him about . . . er . . .

Through the shaking rumble of the train she could feel him shaking . " Why , you funny kid , " she said . " You were scared to death all the time .

The lipless mouth never opened very wide above the thin jaw . He repeated out of the corner of his mouth , " Yessiree , bobby .. . higher than a kite . " They went through the revolving doors into the fiveo'clock crowd that packed the lower Broadway sidewalks to the curbs in the drizzly dusk of a raw February day .

On Lafayette Street the traffic was smoother . The whole stream of metal , glass , upholstery , overcoats , haberdashery , flesh and blood was moving uptown . Cars stopped , started , shifted gears in unison as ifp 275they were run by one set of bells .

" How do you do , mon capitaine , " said Freddy the rattoothed proprietor , nodding a sleek black head . " Monsieur dining with Mademoiselle tonight ? " Charley shook his head . " I have a feller coming to dinner with me at seven . " " Bien , monsieur . " " Let 's have a scotch and soda while I 'm waitin ' and be sure it ai n't that rotgut you tried to palm off on me yes-terday . " Freddy smiled wanly . " It was a mistake , Mr. Anderson . We have the veritable pinchbottle . You see the wrappings . It is still wet from the saltwater . " Charley grunted and dropped into an easychair in the corner of the bar . He drank the whiskey off straight and sipped the soda afterwards . " Hay , Maurice , bring me another , " he called to the greyhaired old wrinklefaced Swiss waiter . " Bring another . Make it double , see ? .. . in a regular highball glass . I 'm tired this evenin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat up straighter . He grinned up at the waiter . " Well , Maurice , you have n't told me what you thought about the market today . " " I 'm not so sure , sir . . . . But you know , Mr. Anderson . . . . If you only wanted to you could tell me . " Charley stretched his legs out and laughed . " Flyin ' higher than a kite , eh . . . . Oh , hell , it 's a bloody chore . I want to forget it . " By the time he saw Eddy Sawyer threading his way towards him through the faces , the business suits , the hands holding glasses in front of the cocktailbar , he felt good . He got to his feet . " How 's the boy , Eddy ? How 's things in little old Deetroit ? They all think I 'm pretty much of a sonofabitch , do n't they ? Give us the dirt , Eddy . " Eddy sighed and sank into the deep chair beside him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What would you say to a bacardi with a touch of absinthe in it ? .. . All right , make it two , Maurice . " Eddy 's face was yellow and wrinkled as a summer apple that 's hung too long on the tree . When he smiled the deepening wrinkles shot out from his mouth and eyes over his cheeks . " Well , Charley old man , it'sP 276good to see you . . . . You know they 're calling you the boy wizard of aviation financing ? " " Is that all they 're callin ' me ? " Charley tapped his dead cigar against the brass rim of the ashtray . " I 've heard worse things than that . " By the time they 'd had their third cocktail Charley got so he could n't stop talking . " Well , you can just tell J. Y. from me that there was one day I could have put him out on his ass and I did n't do it . Why did n't I do it ? Because I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 'd hocked everythin ' they had an ' still they could n't cover , see . . . . I thought , hell , they 're friends of mine . Good old J. Y. Hell , I said to Nat Benton when he wanted me to clean up while the cleanin ' was good . . . they 're friends of mine . Let ' em ride along with us . An ' now look at ' em gangin ' up on me with Gladys . Do you know how much alimony Gladys got awarded her ? Four thousand dollars a month . Judge is a friend of her old man . . . probably gets a rakeoff . Stripped me of my children . . . every damn thing I 've got they 've tied up on me . . . . Pretty , ai n't it , to take a man 's children away from him ? Well , Eddy , I know you had nothin ' to do with it , but when you get back to Detroit and see those yellow bastards who had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me any other way . . . you tell ' em from me that I 'm out to strip ' em to their shirts every last one of ' em . . . . I 'm just beginnin ' to get the hang of this game . I 've made some dust fly . . . the boy wizard , eh ? ... Well , you just tell ' em they ai n't seen nothin ' yet . They think I 'm just a dumb cluck of an inventor . . . just a mechanic like poor old Bill Cermak ... . Hell , let 's eat . " They were sitting at the table and the waiter was putting **29;3453;TOOLONG on Charley 's plate . " Take it away ... I 'll eat a piece of steak , nothing else . " Eddy was eating busily . He looked up at Charley and his face began to wrinkle into a wisecrack . " I guess it 's another case of the woman always pays . " Charley did n't laugh . " Gladys never paid for anythin ' in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Gladys was like . All of those Wheatleys are skinflints . She takes after the old man . . . . Well , I 've learned my lesson . . . . No more rich bitches . . . . Why , a goddam whore would n't have acted the way that bitch has acted .... Well , you can just tell ' em , when you get back to your employers in Detroit . . . I know what they sent you for . . . . To see if the old boy could still takep 277his liquor . . . . Drinkin ' himself to death , so that 's the story , is it ? Well , I Lan still drink you under the table , good old Eddy , ai n't that so ? You just tell ' em , Eddy , that the old boy 's as good as ever , a hell of a lot wiser . . . . They thought they had him out on his can after the divorce , did they , well , you tell ' em to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time she makes a misstep . . . just once , she need n't think I have n't got my operatives watchin ' her ... Tell her I 'm out to get the kids back , an ' strip her of every goddam thing she 's got .... Let her go out on the streets , I do n't give a damn . " Eddy was slapping him on the back . " Well , oldtimer , I 've got to run along . . . . Sure good to see you still riding high , wide and handsome . " " Higher than a kite , " shouted Charley , bursting out laughing . Eddy had gone . Old Maurice was trying to make him eat the piece of steak he 'd taken out to heat up . Charley could n't eat . " Take it home to the wife and kiddies , " he told Maurice . The speak had cleared for the theatertime lull . " Bring me a bottle of champagne , Maurice old man , and then maybe I can get the steak down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eh ? Do n't tell me I been drinking too much . . . I know it . . . . When everybody you had any confidence in has rooked you all down the line you do n't give a damn , do you , Maurice ? " A man with closecropped black hair and a closecropped black mustache was looking at Charley , leaning over a cocktailglass on the bar . " I say you do n't give a damn , " Charley shouted at the man when he caught his eye . " Do you ? " " Hell , no , got anything to say about it ? " said the man , squaring off towards the table . " Maurice , bring this gentleman a glass . " Charley got to his feet and swayed back and forth bowing politely across the table . The bouncer , who 'd come out from a little door in back wiping his red hands on his apron , backed out of the room again . " Anderson my name is . . . . Glad to meet you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blackhaired man who advancedscowling and swaying a little to the other side of the table . Charley pointed to a chair . " I 'm drunk . . . beaucoup champagny water . . . have a glass . " " With pleasure if you put it that way . . . . Always rather drink than tight .... Here 's to the old days of the Rainbow Division . " " Was you over there ? " " Sure . Put it there , buddy . " " Those were the days . "  | " And now you come back and over here there 's nothin ' but a lot of doublecrossin ' bastards . " " Businessmen . . . to hell wid ' em . . . doublecrossin ' bastards I call ' em . " Mr. Budkiewitz got to his feet , scowling again . " To what kind of business do you refer ? " " Nobody 's business . Take it easy , buddy . " Mr. Budkiewitz sat down again . " Oh , hell , bring out another bottle , Maurice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Saumur , Mr. Budkibbitzer ? " " Have I drunk Saumur ? Why should n't I drink it ? Trained there for three months . " " That 's what I said to myself . That boy was overseas , " said Charley . " I 'll tell the cockeyed world . " " What 's your business , Mr. Buchanan ? " " I 'm an inventor . " " Just up my street . Ever heard of the Askew-Merritt starter ? " He 'd never heard of the Askew-Merritt starter and Charley had never heard of the Autorinse washingmachine but soon they were calling each other Charley and Paul . Paul had had trouble with his wife too , said he was going to jail before he 'd pay her any more alimony . Charley said he 'd go to jail too . Instead they went to a nightclub where they met two charming girls . Charley was telling the charming girls how he was going to set Paul , good old Paul , up in business , in the washingmachine business . They went places in taxicabs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place in the Village . Charley was going to get all the girls the sweet pretty little girls jobs in the chorus . Charley was explaining how he was going to take the shirts off those bastards in Detroit . He 'd get the girls jobs in the chorus so that they could take their shirts off . It was all very funny . In the morning light he was sitting alone in a place with torn windowshades . Good old Paul had gone and the girls had gone and he was sitting at a table covered with cigarettestubs and spilt dago red looking at the stinging brightness coming through the worn places in the windowshade . It was n't a hotel or a callhouse , it was some kind of a dump with tables and it stank of old cigar smoke and last night 's spaghetti and tomatosauce and dago red . Somebody was shaking him . " What time is it ? " A fat wop and a young slickhaired wop in p| 279their dirty shirtsleeves were shaking him . " Time to pay up and get out . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrawled on a card . Charley could only read it with one eye at a time . The total was seventyfive dollars . The wops looked threatening . " You tell us give them girls twentyfive dollar each on account . " Charley reached for his billroll . Only a dollar . Where the hell had his wallet gone ? The young wop was playing with a small leather blackjack he 'd taken out of his back pocket . " A century ai n't high for what you spent an ' the girls an ' all . . . . If you f -- k around it 'll cost you more . . . . You got your watch , ai n't you ? This ai n't no clipjoint . " " What time is it ? " " What time is it , Joe ? " " Let me call up the office . I 'll get my secretary to come up . " " What 's the number ? What 's his name ? " The young wop tossed up the blackjackand caught it . " I 'll talk to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We do n't want no hard feelin 's . " After they 'd called up the office and left word that Mr. Anderson was sick and to come at once , they gave him some coffee with rum in it that made him feel sicker than ever . At last Cliff was standing over him looking neat and wellshaved . " Well , Cliff , I 'm not the drinker I used to be . " In the taxicab he passed out cold . He opened his eyes in his bed at the hotel . " There must have been knockout drops in the coffee , " he said to Cliff who sat by the window reading the paper . " Well , Mr. Anderson , you sure had us worried . A damn lucky thing it was they did n't know who they 'd bagged in that clipjoint . If they had it would have cost us ten grand to get out of there . " " Cliff , you 're a good boy . After this you get a raise . " " Seems to me I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benton know ? " " I had to tell him some . I said you 'd eaten some bad fish and had ptomaine poisoning . " " Not so bad for a young feller . God , I wonder if I 'm gettin ' to be a rummy .... How are things downtown ? " " Lousy . Mr. Benton almost went crazy trying to get in touch with you yesterday . " p 280 " Christ , I got a head .... Say , Cliff , you do n't think I 'm gettin ' to be a rummy , do you ? " " Here 's some dope the sawbones left . " " What day of the week is it ? " " Saturday . " " Jesus Christ , I thought it was Friday . " The phone rang . Cliff went over to answer it . " It 's the massage-man . " " Tell him to come up .... Say , is Benton stayin ' in town ? " " Sure he 's in town , Mr. Anderson , he 's trying to get hold of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Merritt ... " " Oh , hell , I 'll hear about it soon enough . Tell this masseur to come in . " After the massage , that was agony , especially the cheerful Germanaccentremarks about the weather and the hockey season made by the big curlyhaired Swede who looked like a doorman , Charley felt well enough to go to the toilet and throw up some green bile . Then he took a cold shower and went back to bed and shouted for Cliff , who was typing letters in the drawingroom , to ring for the bellhop to get cracked ice for a rubber icepad to put on his head . He lay back on the pillows and began to feel a little better . " Hey , Cliff , how about lettin ' in the light of day ? What time is it ? " " About noon . " " Christ .... Say , Cliff , did any women call up ? " Cliffshook his head . " Thank god . " " A guy called up said he was a taxidriver , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job in an airplane factory . . . I told him you 'd left for Miami . " Charley was beginning to feel a little better . He lay back in the soft comfortable bed on the crisplylaundered pillows and looked around the big clean hotel bedroom . The room was high up . Silvery light poured in through the broad window . Through the A between the curtains in the window he could see a piece of sky bright and fleecy as milkweed silk . Charley began to feel a vague sense of accomplishment , like a man getting over the fatigue of a long journey or a dangerousmountainclimb . " Say , Cliff , how about a small gin and bitters with a lot of ice in it ? . . . I think that ' ud probably be the makin ' of me . " " Mr. Anderson , the doc said to swear off and to take some of that dope whenever you felt like taking a drink . " " Every time I take it that stuff makes me puke . What does he think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Anderson ,  |p281you  're the boss , " said Cliff , screwing up his thin mouth . " Thataboy , Cliff .... Then I 'll try some grapefruitjuice and if that stays down I 'll take a good breakfast and to hell wid ' em . . . . Why are n't the papershere ? " " Here they are , Mr. Anderson . . . I 've got ' em all turned to the financial section . " Charley looked over the reports of trading . His eyes would n't focus very well yet . He still did better by closing one eye . A paragraph in News and Comment made him sit up . " Hey , Cliff , " he yelled , " did you see this ? " " Sure , " said Cliff . " I said things were bad . " " But if they 're goin ' ahead it means Merritt and Farrell have got their proxies sure . " Cliff nodded wisely with his head a little to one side . " Where the hell 's Benton ? " " He just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uptown now . " " Hey , give me that drip before he comes and then put all the stuff away and order up a breakfast . " Benton came in the bedroom behind the breakfast tray . He wore a brown suit and a derby . His face looked like an old dishcloth in spite of his snappy clothes . Charley spoke first , " Say , Benton , am I out on my fanny ? " Benton carefully and slowly took off his gloves and hat and overcoatand set them on the mahogany table by the window . " The sidewalk is fairly well padded , " he said . " All right , Cliff . . . . Will you finish up that correspondence ? " Cliff closed the door behind him gently . " Merritt outsmarted us ? " " He and Farrell are playing ball together . All you can do is take a licking and train up for another bout . " " But damn it , Benton ... " Benton got to his feet and walked up and down the room at the foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... I 'm going to do the cussing today . What do you think of a guy who goes on a bender at a critical moment like this ? Yellow , that 's what I call it . . . . You deserved what you got . . . and I had a hell of a time saving my own hide , I can tell you . Well , I picked you for a winner , Anderson , and I still think that if you cut out the funny business you could be in the real money in ten years . Now let me tell you something , young man , you 've gone exactly as far as you can go on your record overseas , and that was certainly a hell of a lot further than most .

How about your brother 's business out in Minnesota ? " " Go back to the sticks and sell tin lizzies . . . that 's a swell future . " " Where do you think Henry Ford made his money ? " " I know . But he keeps his dealers broke . . . . What I need 's to get in good physical shape . I always have a good time in Florida . I might go down there and lay around in the sun for a month . " " O.K. if you keep out of that landboom . " " Sure , Nat , I wo n't even play poker . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Get my leg in real good shape . Then when I come back we 'll see the fur fly . After all there 's still that Standard Airparts stock . " " No longer listed . " " Check . " " Well , optimist , my wife 's expecting me for lunch . . . . Have a good trip . " Benton went out . " Hey , Cliff , " Charley called through the door . " Tell ' em to come and get this damn breakfast tray . It did n't turn out so well . And phone Parker to get the car in shape . Be sure the tires are all O.K. I 'm pullin ' out for Florida Monday . " In a moment Cliff stuck his head in the door . His face was red . " Are you . . . will you be needing me down there , sir ? " " No , I 'll be needin ' you here to keep an eye on the boys downtown . . . . I got to have somebody here I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will have you do though . . . go down to Trenton and accompany Miss Dowlin ' down to Norfolk . I 'll pick her up there . She 's in Trenton visitin ' her folks . Her old man just died or somethin ' . You 'd just as soon do that , would n't you ? It 'll give you a little trip . " Charley was watching Cliff 's face . He screwed his mouth further to one side and bowed like a butler . " Very good , sir , " he said . Charley lay back on the pillows again . His head was throbbing , his stomach was still tied up in knots . When he closed his eyes dizzy redp283lights bloomed in front of them . He began to think about Jim and how Jim had never paid over his share of the old lady 's money he 'd put into the business . Anyway he ai n't got a plane , two cars , a suite at t he Biltmore and a secretary that 'll do any goddam thing in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to remember how her face looked , the funny amazed way she opened her eyes wide when she was going to make a funny crack . He could n't remember a damn thing , only the sick feeling he had all over and the red globes bloomingbefore his eyes . In a little while he fell asleep . He was still feeling so shaky when he started south that he took Parker along to drive the car . He sat glumly in his new camelshair coat with his hands hanging between his knees staring ahead through the roaring blank of the Holland Tunnel thinking of Margo and Bill Edwards the patent lawyer he had to see in Washington about a suit , and remembering the bills in Cliff 's desk drawer and wondering where the money was coming from to fight this patent suit against Askew-Merritt . He had a grand in bills in his pocket and that made him feel good anyway . Gosh , money 's a great thing , he said to himself . They came out of the tunnel into a rainygrey morning and the roar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic graduallythinned and they were going across the flat farmlands of New Jersey strawcolored and ruddy with winter . At Philadelphia Charley made Parker drive him to Broad Street . " I have n't got the patience to drive , I 'll take the afternoon train . Come to the Waldman Park when you get in . " He hired a drawingroom in the parlor car and went and lay down to try to sleep . The train clattered and roared so and the grey sky and the lavender fields and yellow pastures and the twigs of the trees beginning to glow red and green and paleyellow with a foretaste of spring made him feel so blue , so like howling like a dog , that he got fed up with being shut up in the damn drawingroom and went back to the clubcar to smoke a cigar . He was slumped in the leather chair fumbling for the cigarclipper in his vest pocket when the portly man in the next chair looked up from a bluecovered sheaf of lawpapers he was poring over . Charley looked into the black eyes and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastered with a patch of black hair shaped like a bird 's wing , without immediately recognizing it . " Why , Charley ma boy , I reckon you must be in love . " Charleyp 284straightened up and put out his hand . " Hello , senator , " he said , stammeringa little like he used to in the old days . " Goin ' to the nation 's capital ? " " Such is my unfortunate fate . " Senator Planet 's eyes went searching all over him . " Charley , I hear you had an accident ? ' " I 've had a series of them , " said Charley , turning red , Senator Planet nodded his head understandingly and made a clucking noise with his tongue . " Too bad . . . too bad . . . . Well , sir , a good deal of waterhas run under the bridge since you and young Merritt had dinner with me that night in Washington . . . . Well , we 're none of us gettin ' any younger . " Charley got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure from exploring the flabby lines where his neck met his collar and the bulge of his belly against his vest . " Well , we 're none of us getting any younger , " the senator repeated . " You are , senator . I swear you look younger than you did the last time I saw you . " The senator smiled . " Well , I hope you 'll forgive me for makin ' the remark . . . but it 's been one of the most sensational careers I have had the luck to witness in many years of public life . " " Well , it 's a new industry . Things happen fast . " " Unparalleled , " said the senator . " We live in an age of unparalleled progress ... everywhere except in Washington . . . . You should come down to our quiet little village more often . . . . You have many friends there . I see by the papers , as Mr. Dooley used to say , that there 's been considerable reorganization out with you folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose . " " A good many have been thrown out on their broad capital bases , " said Charley . He thought the senator would never quit laughing . The senator pulled out a large initialed silk handkerchief to wipe the tears from his eyes and brought his small pudgy hand down on Charley 's knee . " God almighty , we ought to have a drink on that ? ' The senator ordered whiterock from the porter and mysteriously wafted a couple of slugs of good rye whiskey into it from a bottle he had in his Gladstone bag . Charley began to feel better . The senator was saying that some very interesting developments were to be expected from the development of airroutes . The need for subsidies was pretty generally admitted if this great nation was to catch up on its lag in air transportation . The question would be of course which of a number of competing concerns enjoyed the confidence of the Administration . There was more in this airroute business than there everp 285had been in supplying ships and equipment . " A question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word confidence , SenatorPlanet 's black eyes shone . " That 's why , ma boy , I 'm glad to see you up here . Stick close to our little village on the Potomac , ma boy . " " Check , " said Charley . " When you 're in Miami , look up my old friend Homer Cassidy ... . He 's got a nice boat . . . he 'll take you out fishin ' ... I 'll write him , Charley . If I could get away I might spend a week down there myselfnext month . There 's a world of money bein ' made down there right now . " " I sure will , senator , that 's mighty nice of you , senator . " By the time they got into the Union station Charley and the senatorwere riding high . They were talking trunklines and connecting lines , airports and realestate . Charley could n't make out whether he was hiring Senator Planet for the lobbying or whether Senator Planet was hiring him . They parted almost affectionately at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a pretty , sunny afternoon . The judastrees were beginning to come out red on the sheltered hillsides . He had two bottles of that good rye whiskey Senator Planet had sent up to the hotel for him . As he drove he began to get sore at Parker the chauffeur . All the bastard did was get rakeoffs on the spare parts and gas and oil . Here he 'd charged up eight new tires in the last month , what did he do with tires anyway , eat them ? By the time they were crossing the tollbridge into Norfolk Charley was sore as a crab . He had to hold himself in to keep from hauling off and giving the bastard a crack on the sallow jaw of his smooth flunkey 's face . In front of the hotel he blew up . " Parker , you 're fired . Here 's your month 's wages and your trip back to New York . If I see your face around this town tomorrow I 'll have you run in for theft . You know what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You damn chauffeurs think you 're too damn smart . I know the whole racket , see . . . . I have to work for my dough just as hard as you do . Just to prove it I 'm goin ' to drive myself from now on . " He hated the man 's smooth unmoving face . " Very well , sir , " Parker said coolly . " Shall I return you the uni-form ? " " You can take the uniform and shove it up your ... " Charley paused . He was stamping up and down red in the face on the pave-p 286ment at the hotel entrance in a circle of giggling colored bellboys . " Here , boy , take those bags in and have my car taken around to the garage . . . . All right , Parker , you have your instructions . " He strode into the hotel and ordered the biggest double suite they had . He registered in his own name . " Mrs. Anderson will be here directly . " Then he called up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hello , kid , " he said when at last it was her voice at the end of the wire . " Come on over . You 're Mrs. Anderson and no questionsasked . Aw , to hell with ' em ; nobody 's goin ' to dictate to me what I 'll do or who I 'll see or what I 'm goin ' to do with my money . I 'm through with all that . Come right around . I 'm crazy to see you .... " When she came in , followed by the bellhop with the bags , she certainlylooked prettier than ever . " Well , Charley , " she said , when the bellhop had gone out , " this sure is the cream de la cream . . . . You must have hit oil . " After she 'd run all around the rooms she came back and snuggled up to him . " I bet you been giving ' em hell on the market ? ' " They tried to put somethin ' over on me , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Have a drink , Margo . . . . Let 's get a little bit cockeyed you and me , Margo . . . . Christ , I was afraid you would n't come . " She was doing her face in the mirror . " Me ? Why I 'm only a pushover , " she said in that gruff low tone that made him shiver all up his spine . " Say , where 's Cliff ? " " Our hatchetfaced young friend who was kind enough to accompanyme to the meeting with the lord and master ? He pulled out on the six o'clock train . " " The hell he did . I had some instructions for him . " " He said you said be in the office Tuesday morning and he 'd do it if he had to fly . Say , Charley , if he 's a sample of your employees they must worship the ground you walk on . He could n't stop talking about what a great guy you were . " " Well , they know I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their point of view . It was n't so long ago I was workin ' at a lathe myself . " Charley felt good . He poured them each another drink . Margo took his and poured half of the rye back into the bottle . " Do n't want to get too cockeyed , Mr. A , " she said in that new low caressing voice . Charley grabbed her to him and kissed her hard on the mouth.  | " Christ , if you only knew how I 've wanted to have a really swell woman all to myself . I 've had some awful bitches . . . Gladys , God , what a bitch she was . She pretty near ruined me . . . tried to strip me of every cent I had in the world . . . ganged up on me with guys I bought were my friends . . . . But you just watch , little girl . I 'm goin ' to %how ' em . In five years they 'll come crawlin ' to me on their bellies . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of feel for the big money . . . Nat Renton says I got it . . . I know I got it . I can travel on a hunch , see . ' Those bastards all had money to begin with . " After they 'd ordered their supper and while they were having just one little drink waiting for it , Margo brought out some bills she had in her handbag . " Sure , I 'll handle ' em right away . " Charley shoved them into his pocket without looking at them . " You know , Mr. A , I would n't have to worry you about things like that if I had an account in my own name . " " How about ten grand in the First National Bank when we get to Miami ? " " Suit yourself , Charley . . . I never did understand more money than my week 's salary , you know that . That 's all any real trouper understands . I got cleaned out fixing the folks up in Trenton . It certainly costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charley 's eyes filled with tears . " Was it your dad , Margery ? " She made a funny face . " Oh , no . The old man bumped off from too much Keeley cure when I was a little twirp with my hair down my back .... This was my stepmother 's second husband . I 'm fond of my stepmother , believe it or not . . . . She 's been the only friend I had in this world . I 'll tell you about her someday . It 's quite a story . " " How much did it cost ? I 'll take care of it . " Margo shook her head . " I never loaded my relations on any man 's back , " she said . ' When the waiter came in with a tray full of big silver dishes followed by a second waiter pushing in a table already set , Margo pulled apart from Charley . " Well , this is the life , " she whispered in a way that made him laugh . Driving down was a circus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south there began to be a green fuzz of spring on the woods . There were flowers in the pinebarrens . Birds were singing . The car ran like a dream . Charley kept her at sixty on the concrete roads , drivingcarefully , enjoying the driving , the good fourwheel brakes , the easy whir of the motor under the hood . Margo was a smart girl and p 288crazy about him and kept making funny cracks . They drank just enough to keep them feeling good . They made Savannah late that night and felt so good they got so tight there the manager threatened to run them out of the big old hotel . That was when Margo threw an ashtray through the transom . They 'd been too drunk to have much fun in bed that night and woke up with a taste of copper in their mouths and horrible heads . Margo looked haggard and green and saggy under the eyes before she went in to take her bath . Charley made her a prairie oyster for breakfastlike he said the English aviators used to make over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up without breaking the eggyolk . She made him come and look at it in the toilet before she pulled the chain . There was the raw eggyolk looking up at them like it had just come out of the shell . They could n't help laughing about it in spite of their heads . It was eleven o'clock when they pulled out . Charley drove kind of easy along the winding road through the wooded section of southern Georgia , cut with inlets and saltmarshes from which cranes flew up and once a white flock of egrets . They felt pretty pooped by the time they got to Jacksonville . Neither of them could eat anything but a lambchop washed down with some lousy gin they paid eight dollars a quart for to the colored bellboy who claimed it was the best English gin imported from Nassau the night before . They drank the gin with bitters and went to bed . Driving down from Jax to Miami the sun was real hot . Charley wanted to have the top down to get plenty of air but Margo would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A girl 'll sacrifice anything for a man except her complexion . " They could n't eat on the way down , though Charley kept tanking up on the gin . When they got into Miami they went right to the old Palms where Margo used to work and got a big ovation from Joe Kantor and Eddy Palermo and the boys of the band . They all said it looked like a honeymoon and kidded about seeing the marriagelicense . " Merely a chance acquaintance ... something I picked up at the bus station in Jax , " Margo kept saying . Charley ordered the best meal they had in the house and drinks all around and champagne . They danced all evening in spite of his game leg . When he passed out they took him upstairs to Joe and Mrs. Kantor 's own room . When he began to wake up Margo was sittingfully dressed looking fresh as a daisy on the edge of the bed . Itp289late in the morning . She brought him up breakfast on a tray If . " Look here , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here for a rest . No ) re nightclubs for a while . I 've rented us a little bungalow down the beach and we 'll put you up at the hotel to avoid the breath scandal and you 'll like it . What we need 's the influence of the me .... And you and me , Mr. A , we 're on the wagon . " The bungalow was in Spanishmison style , and cost a lot , butthey sure had a good time at Miami Beach . They played the dograces and the roulettewheels and Charley got in with a bunch of allnight pokerplayers through Homer Cassidy , Senator Planet 's friend , a big smiling cultured whitehaired southerner in a baggy linen suit , who came round to the hotel to look him up . After a lot of talking about one thing and another , Cassidy got around to the fact that he was buying up options on property for the new airport and would let Charley in on it for the sake of his connections , but he had to have cash right away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won enough to have a big roll of bills on him , but his bankaccount was a dog of a different stripe . He began burning up the wires to Nat Benton 's office in New York . Margo tried to keep him from drinking ; the only times he could reallyget a snootful were when he went out fishing with Cassidy . Margo would n't go fishing , she said she did n't like the way the fish looked at her when they came up out of the water . One day he 'd gone down to the dock to go fishing with Cassidy but found that the norther that had come up that morning was blowing too hard . It was damn lucky because just as Charley was leaving the dock a Western Union rnessengerboy came up on his bike . The wind was getting sharper everyminute and blew the chilly dust in Charley 's face as he read thetelegram . It was from the senator : ADMINISTRATION PREPARES OATS FOR PEGASUS . As soon as he got back to the beach Charleytalked to Benton over longdistance . Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wires of a bill introduced to subsidize airlines . Charley sold everything he had at the top , covered his marginsand was sitting pretty when the afternoon papers killed the story . A week later he started to rebuy at twenty points lower . Anyway he 'd have the cash to refinance his loans and go in with Cassidy on the options . When he told Cassidy he was ready to go in with him they went out on the boat to talk things over . A colored boy made themp 290mintjuleps . They sat in the stern with their rods and big straw hats to keep the sun out of their eyes and the juleps on a table behind them . When they got to the edge of the blue water they began to troll for sailfish . It was a day of blue sky with big soft pinkishwhite clouds lavender underneath drifting in the sun . There was enough wind blowing against the current out in the Gulf Stream to make sharp choppy waves green where they broke and blue and purple in the trough . They followed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any sailfish . Cassidy caught a dolphin and Charley lost one . The boat pitched so that Charley had to keep working on the juleps to keep his stomach straight . Most of the morning they cruised back and forth in front of the mouth of the Miami River . Beyond the steep dark waves they could see the still sunny brown water of the bay and against the horizon the new buildings sparkling white among a red web of girder construction . " Buildin , that 's what I like to see , " said Homer Cassidy , waving a veined hand that had a big old gold sealring on it towards the city . " And it 's just beginnin .... Why , boy , I kin remember when Miamah was the jumpin'off place , a little collection of brokendown shacks between the railroad and the river , and I tell you the mosquitoes were fierce . There were a few crackers down here growin ' early tomatoes and layin ' abed half the time with chills and fever . . . and now look at it . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you the boom ai n't sound . " Charley nodded without speaking . He was having a tussle with a fish on his line . His face was getting red and his hand was cramped from reeling . " Nothin ' but a small bonito , " said Cassidy . " . . . The way they try to tell you the fishin ' ai n't any good . . . that 's all propaganda for the West Coast . . . . Boy , I must admit that I saw it comin ' years ago when I was workin ' with old Flagler . There was a man with vision ... . I went down with him on the first train that went over the overseas extension into Key West . . . I was one of the attorneys for the road at the time . Schoolchildren threw roses under his feet all the way from his private car to the carriage .... We had nearly a thousand men carriedaway in hurricanes before the line was completed . . . and now the new Miamah . . . an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It 's Flagler 's dream come true . " " Well , what I 'd like to do , " Charley began and stopped to take a big swig of the new julep the colored boy had just handed him . He wasp291benning to feel wonderful now that the little touch of seasicknessgone . Cassidy 's fishing guide had taken Charley 's rod up forwardput a new hook on it , so Charley was sitting there in the stern ofmotorboat feeling the sun eat into his back and little flecks of saltguy drying on his face with nothing to do but sip the julep , withhing to worry about . " Cassidy , this sure is the life . . . why ca n't ado what he wants to with his life ? I was just go ' to say what Int to do is get out of this whole racket . . . investments , all thatp . . . . I 'd like to get out with a small pile and get a house and settlewn to monkeyin ' around with motors and designin ' planes andff like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could pull out with enoughk I 'd like to build me a windtunnel all my own . . . you know that'sat they test out model planes in . " " Of course , " said Cassidy , " it'siation that 's goin ' to make Miami . . . . Think of it , eighteen , fourteen , ten hours from New York . . . . I do n't need to tell you . . . and you and me and the Senator . . . we 're right in among the foundin ' fathers with that airport . . . . Well , boy , I 've waited all ma life to make a real killin ' . All ma life I been servin ' others . . . on the bench , railroad lawyer , all that sort of thing . . . . Seems to me about time to make a pile of ma own . " " Suppose they pick some other place , then we 'll be holdin ' the bag . After all it 's happened before , " said Charley . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself that that 's the ideal locationand then ... I ought n't to be tellin ' you this but you 'll find it out soon anyway . . . well , you know our Washington friend , well , he 's one of the forwardestlooking men in this country . . . . That money I put up do n't come out of Homer Cassidy 's account because Homer Cassidy 's broke . That 's what 's worryin ' me right this minute . I 'm merely his agent . And in all the years I 've been associated with SenatorPlanet upon ma soul and body I 've never seen him put up a cent unless it was a sure thing . " Charley began to grin . " Well , the old sonofabitch . " Cassidy laughed . " You know the one about a nod 's as good as a wink to a blind mule . How about a nice Virginia ham sandwich ? " They had another drink with the sandwiches . Charley got to feelinglike talking . It was a swell day . Cassidy was a prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Charley said , " when I first saw Miami it was from out at sea like this . I never would have thought I 'd be down here shovelin ' in the dough . . . . There were n't all those tall buildin 's thenp292either . I was goin ' up to New York on a coastin ' boat . I was just a kid and I 'd been down to New Orleans for the Mardi Gras and I tell you I was broke . I got on the boat to come up to New York and got to pallin ' with a Florida cracker . . . he was a funny guy . . . . We went up to New York together . He said the thing to do was get over an ' see the war , so him and me like a pair of damn fools we enlisted in one of those volunteerambulance services . After that I switched to aviation . That 's how I got started in my line of business . Miami did n't mean a thing to me then . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Cassidy . " And I 'm not ashamed to admit it . . . buyin ' up rightofway for the Florida East Coast . . . . Flagler started me and he started Miamah . " That night when they got in sunburned and a little drunk from the day on the Gulf Stream they tucked all the options away in the safe in Judge Cassidy 's office and went over to the Palms to relax from businesscares . Margo wore her silver dress and she certainly looked stunning . There was a thin dark Irishlooking girl there named Eileen who seemed to know Cassidy from way back . The four of them had dinner together , Cassidy got good and tight and opened his mouth wide as a grouper 's talking about the big airport and saying how he was going to let the girls in on some lots on the deal . Charley was drunk , but he was n't too drunk to know Cassidy ought to keep his trap shut . When he danced with Eileen he talked earnestly in her ear telling her she ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made public from the proper quarters . Margo saw them with their heads together and acted the jealous bitch and started making over Cassidy to beat the cars . When Charley got her to dance with him she played dumb and would n't answer when he spoke to her . He left her at the table and went over to have some drinks at the bar . There he got into an argument with a skinny guy who looked like a cracker . Eddy Palermo , with an oily smile on his face the shape and color of an olive , ran over and got between them . " You ca n't fight this gentleman , Mr. Anderson , he 's our county attorney . . . . I know you gentlemen would like each other . . . Mr. Pappy , Mr. Anderson was one of our leading war aces . " They dropped their fists and stood glaring at each other with the little wop nodding and grinning between them . Charley put out his hand . " All right , put it there , pal , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look and put his hands in his pockets . " County attorneyp 293t , " said Charley . He was reeling . He had to put his hand againstwall to steady himself . And he turned and walked out ther . Outside he found Eileen who 'd just come out of the ladies ' mu and was patting back her sleek hair in front of the mirrorthe hatchecking stand . He felt choked with the whiskey and the garsmoke and the throbbing hum of the band and the shuffle oft . He had to get outdoors . " Come on , girlie , we 're goin ' for a ride , t some air . " Before the girl could open her mouth he 'd dragged her ut to the parkinglot . " Oh , but I do n't think we ought to leave the others , " she kept saying . " They 're too goddam drunk to know . I 'll ring you back in five minutes . A little air does a little girl good , especially a pretty little girl like you . " The gears shrieked because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car stalled ; he started the motor again and immediately went into high . The motor knocked for a minute but began to gather speed . " See , " he said , " not a bad little bus . " As he drove he talked out of the corner of his mouth to Eileen . " That 's the last time I go into that dump . . . . Those little cracker politicians fresh out of the turpentine camps ca n't get fresh with me . I can buy and sell ' em too easy like buyin ' a bag of peanuts . Like that bastard Farrell . I 'll buy and sell him yet . You do n't know who he is but all you need to know is he 's a crook , one of the biggest crooks in the country , an ' he thought , the whole damn lot of ' em thought , they 'd put me out like they did poor old Joe Askew . But the man with the knowhow , the boy who thinks up the gadgets , they ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own game too . We got somethin ' bigger down here than they ever dreamed of . And the Administration all fixed up . This is goin ' to be big , little girl , the biggest thing you ever saw and I 'm goin ' to let you in on it . We 'll be on easystreet from now on . And when you 're on easystreet you 'll all forget poor old Charley Anderson the boy that put you wise . " " Oh , it 's so cold , " moaned Eileen . " Let 's go back . I 'm shivering . " Charley leaned over and put his arm round her shoulders . As he turned the car swerved . He wrenched it back onto the concrete road again . " Oh , please do be careful , Mr. Anderson .... You 're doing cightyfive now . . . . Oh , do n't scare me , please . " Charley laughed . " My , what a sweet little girl . Look , we 're down to forty just bowlin ' pleasantly along at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's time little chickens were in bed . But you must never be scared in a car when I 'm driving . If there 's one thing I can do it 's drivep 294a car . But I do n't like to drive a car . Now if I had my own ship here . How would you like to take a nice trip in a plane ? I'da had it down here before this but it was in hock for the repair bills . Had to put a new motor in . But now I 'm on easystreet . I 'll get one of the boys to fly it down to me . Then we 'll have a real time . You an ' me an ' Margo . Old Margo 's a swell girl , got an awful temper though . That 's one thing I can do , I know how to pick the women . " When they turned to run back towards Miami they saw the long streak of the dawn behind the broad barrens dotted with dead pines and halfbuilt stucco houses and closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . We 'll have you back before you can say Jack Robinson " They were running along beside a railroad track . They were catching up on two red lights . " I wonder if that 's the New York train . " They were catching up on it , past the lighted observation car , past the sleepers with no light except through the groundglass windows of the dressingrooms at the ends of the cars . They were creeping up on the baggagecar and mailcars and the engine , very huge and tall and black with a little curling shine from Charley 's headlights in the dark . The train had cut off the red streak of the dawn . " Hell , they do n't make no speed . " As they passed the cab the whistle blew . " Hell , I can beat him to the crossin ' . " The lights of the crossing were ahead of them and the long beam of the engine 's headlight , that made the red and yellow streak of the dawn edging the clouds very pale and far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charley stepped on the gas . They crashed through the bar , shattering their headlights . The car swerved around sideways . Their eyes were full of the glare of the locomotive headlight and the shriek of the whistle . " Do n't be scared , we 're through , " Charley yelled at the girl . The car swerved around on the tracks and stalled . He was jabbing at the starter with his foot . The crash was n't anything . When he came to he knew right away he was in a hospital . First thing he began wondering if he was going to have a hangover . He could n't move . Everything was dark . From way down in a pit he could see the ceiling . Then he could see the peak of a nurse 's cap and a nurse leaning over him . All the time he was talking . He could n't stop talking . " Well , I thought we were done for . Say , nurse , where did we crack up ? Was it at the airport ? I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , nurse . . . I 'd taken that little girl up to let her get the feel of that new Boeing ship ... you know the goldarned thing . . . . I was sore as hell at somebody , must have been my wife , poor old Gladys , did she give me a dirty deal ? But now after this airport deal I 'll be buyin ' an ' sellin ' the whole bunch of them . Say , nurse , what happened ? Was it at the airport ? " The nurse 's face and her hair were yellow under the white cap . She had a thin face without lips and thin hands that went past his eyes to smooth the sheet under his chin . " You must try and rest , " she said . " Or else I 'll have to give you anotherhypodermic . " " Say , nurse , are you a Canadian ? I bet you 're a Canadian . " " No , I 'm from Tennessee . . . . Why ? " " My mistake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the nurses have been Canadians . Is n't it kinder dark in here ? I wish I Could tell you how it happened . Have they called the office ? I guess maybe I drink too much . After this I attend strictly to business . I tell you a man has to keep his eyes open in this game . . . . Say , ca n't you get me some water ? " " I 'm the night nurse . It is n't day yet . You try and get some sleep . " " I guess they 've called up the office . I 'd like Stauch to take a look at the ship before anything 's touched . Funny , nurse . I do n't feel much pain , but I feel so terrible ? ' " That 's just the hypodermics , " said the nurse 's brisk low voice . " Now you rest quietly and in the morning you 'll wake up feeling a whole lot better . You can only rinse out your mouth with this . " " Check . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was this way . I had some sort of a wrangle with a guy . Are you listenin , nurse ? I guess I 've got a kind of a chip on my shoulder since they 've been gangin ' up on me so . In the old days I used to think everybody was a friend of mine , see . Now I know they 're all crooks . . . even Gladys , she turned out the worst crook of the lot . . . . I guess it 's the hangover makes me so terribly thirsty . " The nurse was standing over him again . " I 'm afraid we 'll have to give you a little of the sleepy stuff , brother . . . . Now just relax . Think of somethin ' nice . That 's a good boy . " He felt her dabbing at his arm with something cold and wet . He feltp 296the prick of the needle . The hard bed where he lay awake crumbled gradually under him . He was sinking , without any sweetness of sleep coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a stout starched woman standing over him . It was day . The shadows were different . She was poking some papers under his nose . She had a hard cheerful voice . " Good morning , Mr. Anderson , is there anything I can do for you ? " Charley was still down in a deep well . The room , the stout starched woman , the papers were far away above him somewhere . All around his eyes were stinging hot . " Say , I do n't feel as if I was all there , nurse . " " I 'm the superintendent . There are a few formalities if you do n't mind ... if you feel well enough . " " Did you ever feel like it had all happened before ? . . . Say , where , I mean what town . . . ? Never mind , do n't tell me , I remember it all now . " " I 'm the superintendent . If you do n't mind , the office would like a check for your first week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Do n't worry . I 've got money .... For God 's sake get me a drink . " " It 's just the regulations . " " There must be a checkbook in my coat somewhere . . . . Or get hold of Cliff . . . Mr. Wegman , my secretary . . . . He can make out a check for you . " " Now do n't you bother about anything , Mr. Anderson .... The officehas made out a blank check . I 'll fill in the name of the bank . You sign it . That will be two hundred and fifty dollars on account . " " Bankers ' Trust , New York . . . . Gosh , I can just about sign my name . " " The questionnaire we 'll get the nurse to fill out later . . . for our records . . . . Well , goodby , Mr. Anderson , I hope you have a very pleasantstay with us and wishing you a quick recovery . " The stout starched woman had gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly felt scared . " What is this dump anyway ? Where am I ? Say , nurse , nurse . " He shouted as loud as he could . The sweat broke out all over his face and neck and ran into his ears and eyes . He could move his head and his arms but the pit of his stomach was gone . He had no feeling in his legs . His mouth was dry with thirst. p 297A new pretty pink nurse was leaning over him . " What can I do for you , mister ? " She wiped his face and showed him where the bell was hanging just by his hand . " Nurse , I 'm terribly thirsty , " he said in a weak voice . " Now you must just rinse out your mouth . The doctor does n't want you to eat or drink anything until he 's established the drainage . " " Where is this doctor ? ... Why is n't he here now ? ... Why has n't he been here right along ? If he is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Here 's Dr. Snyder right now , " said the nurse in an awed whisper . " Well , Anderson , you surely had a narrow squeak . You probably thought you were in a plane all the time .... Funny , I 've never known an airplane pilot yet who could drive a car . My name 's Snyder . Dr. Ridgely Snyder of New York . Dr. Booth the housephysician here has called me in as a consultant . It 's possible we may have to patch up your inside a little . You see when they picked you up , as I understand it , a good deal of the car was lying across your middle . . . a very lucky break that it did n't finish you right there . . . . You understand me , do n't you ? " Dr. Snyder was a big man with flat closeshaven cheeks and square hands ending in square nails . A song old man Vogel used to sing ran across Charley 's faint mind as he looked at the doctor standing there big and square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Kaiser the butcher but they do n't know each other . " I guess it 's the dope but my mind do n't work very good .... You do the best you can , doc . . . and do n't spare any expense . I just fixed up a little deal that 'll make their ears ring . . . . Say , doctor , what about that little girl ? Was n't there a little girl in the car ? " " Oh , do n't worry about her . She 's fine . She was thrown absolutely clear . A slight concussion , a few contusions , she 's coming along splen-didly . " " I was scared to ask . " " We 've got to do a little operating . . . suture of the intestine , a very interesting problem . Now I do n't want you to have anything on your mind , Mr. Anderson .... It 'll just be a stitch here and a stitch there .. . we 'll see what we can do . This was supposed to be my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in in an emergency . " " Well , thank you , doc , for whatever you can do .... I guess I ought not to drink so much . . . . Say , why wo n't they let me drink some water ? . . . It 's funny , when I first came to in here I thought I was in an-p 298other of them clipjoints . Now Doris , she wouldn'ta liked me to talk like that , you know , bad grammar , conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman . But you know , doc , when you get so you can buy ' em and sell ' em like an old bag of peanuts , a bag of stale goobers , you do n't care what they think . You know , doc , it may be a great thing for me bein ' laid up , give me a chance to lay off the liquor , think about things .... Ever thought about things , doc ? " " What I 'm thinking right now , Mr. Anderson , is that I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , you do your stuff , doc . . . you send that pretty nurse in an ' lemme talk to her . I want to talk about old Bill Cermak . . . . He was the only straight guy I ever knew , him an ' Joe Askew . . . . I wonder how he felt when he died . . . . You see the last time I was , well , call it constitutionally damaged . . . him and me smashed up in a plane .. . the new Mosquito . . . there 's millions in it now but the bastards got the stock away from me . . . . Say , doc , I do n't suppose you ever died , did you ? " There was nothing but the white ceiling above him , brighter where the light came from the window . Charley remembered the bell by his hand . He rang and rang it . Nobody came . Then he yanked at it until he felt the cord pull out somewhere . The pretty pink nurse 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her young rarelykissed mouth was moving . He could see it making clucking noises , but a noise like longdistance in his ears kept him from hearing what she said . It was only when he was talking he did n't feel scared . " Look here , young woman . . . " he could hear himself talking . He was enjoying hearing himself talking . " I 'm payin ' the bills in this hospital and I 'm goin ' to have everythin ' just how I want it . . . . I want you to sit here an ' listen while I talk , see . Let 's see , what was I tellin ' that bird about ? He may be a doctor but he looks like William Kaiser the butcher to me . You 're too young to know that song .

In the grey oblong of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was looking at him with eyes round as a bird 's . " You 're not mad , Margery , are you ? " " I 'm worse than mad , I 'm worried .

He looks like William Kaiser the butcher all except the mustaches . . . what do you know about that , I forgot the mustaches . . . . Do n't look at me funny like that . I 'm all right , see . I just feel better if I talk , see . I bet I 'm the talkin'est patient they ever had in this hospital .... Margo , you know I mighta gotten to be a rummy if I 'd kept on drinkin ' like that . It 's just as well to be caught up short . " " Say , Charley , are you well enough to write out a check ? I 've got to have some jack . You know you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal . And I 've got to hire a lawyer for you . Eileen 's folks are going to sue . That county attorney 's sworn out a warrant . I brought your New York checkbook .

" " Gim me a chance to get out of the hospital . " " Charley , you poor unfortunate Mr. A . . . you do n't think it 's any fun for me to worry you at a time like this ... but I 've got to eat like other people . . . an ' if I had some jack I could fix that county attorney up . . . and keep the stuff out of the papers and everything . You know the kind of story they 'll make out of it . . . but I got to have money quick . " All right , make out a check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you I did n't break my arm : ' The pretty pink nurse had come back . Her voice was cold and sharp and icy . " I 'm afraid it 's time , " she said . Margo leaned over and kissed him on the forehead . Charley felt like he was in a glass case . There was the touch of her lips , the smell of her dress , her hair , the perfume she used , but he could n't feel them . Like a scene in a movie he watched her walk out , the sway of her hips under the tight dress , the little nervous way she was fluttering the check under her chin to dry the ink on it . " Say , nurse , it 's like a run on a bank . . . I guess they think the old institution 's not so sound as it might be . . . . I 'm givin ' orders now , see , tell ' em down at the desk , no more visitors , see ? You and me an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Anyway now it 's time for a little trip across the hall , " said the pretty pink nurse , in a cheerful voice like it was a show or a baseballgamethey were going to. p 300An orderly came in . The room started moving away from the cot , a grey corridor was moving along , but the moving made blind spasms of pain rush up through his legs . He sank into sour puking blackness again . When it was light again it was very far away . His tongue was dry in his mouth he was so thirsty . Reddish mist was over everything . He was talking but way off somewhere . He could feel the talk coming out of his throat but he could n't hear it . What he heard was the doctor'svoice saying peritonitis like it was the finest party in the world , like you 'd say Merry Christmas . There were other voices . His eyes were open , there were other voices . He must be delirious . There was Jim sitting there with a puzzled sour gloomy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was a kid on Sunday afternoons going over his books . " That you , Jim ? How did you get here ? " " We flew , " answered Jim . It was a surprise to Charley that people could hear him , his voice was so far away .

Margo DowlingAgnes got off the sleeper dressed from head to foot in black crape . She had put on weight and her face had a grey rumpled look Margo had n't noticed on it before . Margo put her head on Agnes 's shoulder and burst out crying right there in the sunny crowded Miami station . They got into the Buick to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car or the uniformed chauffeur or anything . She took Margo 's hand and they sat looking away from each other out into the sunny streets full of slowlymoving people in light clothes . Margo was pattingher eyes with her lace handkerchief . " Ought n't you to wear black ? " Agnes said . " Would n't you feel better if you were wearing black ? " It was n't until the blue Buick drew up at the door of the bungalowp 304on the beach and Raymond , the thinfaced mulatto chauffeur , hopped out smiling respectfully to take the bags that Agnes began to notice anything . She cried out , " Oh , what a lovely car . " Margo showed her through the house and out on the screened porch under the palms facing the purpleblue sea and the green water along the shore and the white breakers . " Oh , it 's too lovely , " Agnes said and let herself drop into a Gloucester hammock sighing . " Oh , I 'm so tired . " Then she began to cry again . Margo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hall . " Well , " she said when she came back looking freshpowdered and rosy , " how do you like the house ? Some little shack , is n't it ? " " Oh , we wo n't be able to stay here now . . . . What 'll we do now ? " Agnes was blubbering . " I know it 's all the wicked unreality of matter .... Oh , if he 'd only had proper thoughts . " " Anyway the rent 's paid for another month , " said Margo . " Oh , but the expense , " sobbed Agnes . Margo was looking out through the screendoor at a big black tanker on the horizon . She turned her head and talked peevishly over her shoulder . " Well , there 's nothing to keep me from turning over a few options , is there ? I tell you what they are having down here 's a boom . Maybe we can make some money . I know everybody who is anybody in this town . You just wait and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought in a silver coffeeservice and cups and a plate of toast on a silver tray covered by a lace doily . Agnes pushed back her veil , drank some coffee in little gulps and began to nibble at a piece of toast . " Have some preserves on it , " said Margo , lighting herself a cigarette . " I did n't think you and Frank believed in mourning . " " I could n't help it . It made me feel better . Oh , Margo , have you ever thought that if it was n't for our dreadful unbelief they might be with us this day . " She dried her eyes and went back to the coffee and toast . " When 's the funeral ? " " It 's going to be in Minnesota . His folks have taken charge of everything . They think I 'm ratpoison . " " Poor Mr. Anderson .... You must be prostrated , you poor child .

" " He is here , " Agnes shrieked and went all to pieces and started sobbingagain . " He 's watching over us right now . I know that ! " She dried her eyes and sniffed . " Oh , Margie , coming down on the train I 'd been thinking that maybe you and Mr. Anderson had been secretly married . He must have left an enormous estate . " " Most of it is tied up . . . . But Charley was all right , he fixed me up as we went along . " " But just think of it , two such dreadful things happening in one winter " " Agnes , " said Margo , getting to her feet , " if you talk like that I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Have n't I been depressed enough ? Your nose is all red . It 's awful .... Look , you make yourself at home . I 'm going out to attend to some business . " " Oh , I ca n't stay here . I feel too strange , " sobbed Agnes . " Well , you can come along if you take off that dreadful veil . Hurry up , I 've got to meet somebody . " She made Agnes fix her hair and put on a white blouse . The black dress really was quite becoming to her . Margo made her put on a little makeup . " There , dearie . Now you look lovely , " she said and kissed her . " Is this really your car ? " sighed Agnes as she sank back on the seat of ' the blue Buick sedan . " I ca n't believe it . " " Want to see the registrationpapers ? " said Margo . " All right , Raymond , you know where the broker 's office is . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touching the shiny visor of his cap as the motor started to hum under the unscratched paint of the hood . At the broker 's office there was the usual welldressed elderly crowd in sportsclothes filling up the benches , men with panamahats held on knees of Palm Beach suits and linen plusfours , women in pinks and greens and light tan and white crisp dresses . It always affected Margo a little like church , the whispers , the deferential manners , the boys quick and attentive at the long blackboards marked with columns of symbols , the click of the telegraph , the firm voice reading the quotationsoff the ticker at a desk in the back of the room . As they went in Agnes in an awed voice whispered in Margo 's ear had n't she better go and sit in the car until Margo had finished her business . " No , stick around , " said Margo . " You see those boys are chalking up the p| 306stockmarket play by play on those blackboards . . . . I 'm just beginning to get on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and broadflanged Jewish noses smilingly made room for them on a bent h in the back of the room . Several people turned and stared at Margo . She heard a woman 's voice hissing something about Anderson to the man beside her . There was a little stir of whispering and nudging . Margo felt welldressed and did n't care . " Well , ma dear young lady , " Judge Cassidy 's voice purred behind her , " buyin ' or sellin ' today ? " Margo turned her head . There was the glint of a gold tooth in the smile on the broad red face under the thatch of silvery hair the same color as the grey linen suit which was crossed by another glint of gold in the watchchain looped double across the ample bulge of the judge 's vest . Margo shook her head . " Nothing much doing today , " she said . Judge Cassidy jerked his head and started for the door . Margo got up and followed , pulling Agnes after her . When they got out in the breezy sunshine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margo introduced Agnes as her guardianangel . " I hope you wo n't disappoint us today the way you did yesterday , ma dear young lady , " began Judge Cassidy . " Perhaps we can induce Mrs. Mandeville ... " " I 'm afraid not , " broke in Margo . " You see the poor darling 's so tired . . . . She 's just gotten in from New York . . . . You see , Agnes dear , we are going to look at some lots . Raymond will take you home , and lunch is all ordered for you and everything . . . . You just take a nice rest . " " Oh , of course I do need a rest , " said Agnes , flushing . Margo helped her into the Buick that Raymond had just brought around from the parkingplace , kissed her and then walked down the block with the judge to where his Pierce Arrow touringcar stood shiny and glittery in the hot noon sunlight . The judge drove his own car . Margo sat with him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car she said , " Well , what about that check ? " " Why , ma dear young lady , I 'm very much afraid that no funds means no funds . . . . I presume we can recover from the estate . " " Just in time to make a first payment on a cemetery lot . " " Well , those things do take time . . . the poor boy seems to have left his affairs in considerable confusion . " p 307 " Poor guy , " said Margo , looking away through the rows of palms at the brown reaches of Biscayne Bay . Here and there on the green isridsnew stucco construction stuck out raw , like stagescenery out on e sidewalk in the daytime . " Honestly I did the best I could to raighten him out . " " Of course . . . . Of course he had very considerable holdings .... It as that crazy New York life . Down here we take things easily , we ow how to let the fruit ripen on the tree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lemons . " She started to laugh but the dge did n't join in . Neither of them said anything for a while . They 'd reached thed of the causeway and turned past yellow frame wharfbuildingsto the dense traffic of the Miami waterfront . Everywhere new tall buildings iced like layercake were standing up out of scaffolding end builder 's rubbish . Rumbling over the temporary wooden bridgerocs the Miami River in a roar of concretemixers and a drive of ust from the construction work , Margo said , turning a roundeyedkerface at the judge , " Well , I guess I 'll have to hock the old sparus . " The judge laughed and said , " I can assure you the bank will afford you every facility .... Do n't bother your pretty little head about . You hold some very considerable options right now if I 'm not mistaken . " " I do n't suppose you could lend me a couple of grand to run on on the strength of them , judge . " They were running on a broad new concrete road through dense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Judge Cassidy in his genial drawl , " I could n't do that for your own sake . . . think of the false interpretations ... the idle gossip . We 're a little oldfashioned down here . We 're easygoin ' but once the breath of scandal . . . Why , even drivin ' with such a charmin ' passenger through the streets of Miamah is a folly , a very pleasant folly . But you must realize , ma dear young lady , .. A man in ma position ca n't afford . . . Do n't misunderstand ma motive , ma dear young lady . I never turned down a friend in ma life .... But ma position would unfortunately not be understood that way . Only a husband or a ... " " Is this a proposal , judge ? " she broke in sharply . Her eyes were stinging . It was hard keeping back the tears . " Just a little advice to a client . . . . " The judge sighed . " UnfortunatelyI 'm a family man . "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't need to remind you what type of animal is born every minute . " " No need at all , " said Margo gruffly . They were driving into the parkinglot behind the great new caramelcoloredhotel . As she got out of the car Margo said , " Well , I guess some of them can afford to lose their money but we ca n't , can we , judge ? " " Ma dear young lady , there 's no such word in the bright lexiconof youth . " The judge was ushering her into the diningroom in his fatherly way . " Ah , there are the boys now . " At a round table in the center of the crowded diningroom sat two fatfaced young men with big mouths wearing pinkstriped shirts and nilegreen wash neckties and white suits . They got up still chewing and pumped Margo 's hand when the judge presented them . They were twins . As they sat down again one of them winked and shook a fat forefinger . " We used to see you at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boys , " said the judge , " how 's tricks ? " " Could n't be better , " one of them said with his mouth full . " You see , boys , " said the judge , " this young lady wants to make a few small investments with a quick turnover . . . . " The twins grunted and went on chewing . After lunch the judge drove them all down to the Venetian Pool where William Jennings Bryan sitting in an armchair on the float undera striped awning was talking to the crowd . From where they were they could n't hear what he was saying , only the laughter and handclappingof the crowd in the pauses . " Do you know , judge , " said one of the twins , as they worked their way through the fringes of the crowd around the pool , " if the old boy had n't wasted his time with politics , he'da made a great auctioneer ? ' Margo began to feel tired and wilted . She followed the twins into the realestateoffice full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair . She sat there tapping with her white kid foot on the tiled floor with her lap full of blueprints . The prices were all so high . She felt out of her depth and missed Mr. A to buy for her , he 'd have known what to buy sure . Outside , the benches on the lawn were crowded . Bawling voices came from everywhere . The auction was beginning . The twins on the stand were waving their arms and banging with their hammers . The judge was striding around behind Margo 's chair talking boom to anybody who would listen . When he pausedp309breath she looked up at him and said , " Judge Cassidy , could you me a taxi ? " " Ma dear young lady , I 'll drive you home myself . It'lla pleasure . " " O.K. , " said Margo . " You are very wise , " whispered ge Cassidy in her ear . As they were walking along the edge of the crowd one of the twins they 'd had lunch with left the auctioneer 's stand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' he said , " kin me an ' Al come to I ? " " Sure , " said Margo , smiling . " Name 's in the phonebook under wling . " " We 'll be around . " And he ran back to the stand where his -t her was pounding with his hammer . She 'd been afraid she had n't de a hit with the twins . Now she felt the tired lines smoothing out her face . " Well , what do you think of the great development of Coral Gas ? " said the judge as he helped her into the car . " Somebody must making money , " said Margo dryly . Once in the house she pulled off her hat and told Raymond , who ted as butler in the afternoons , to make some martini cocktails , and the judge a cigar and then excused herself for a moment . Upirsshe found Agnes sitting in her room in a lavender negligee anicuring her nails at the dressingtable . Without saying a word argo dropped on the bed and began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle and came over to the bed . " Why , Margie , u never cry .... " " I know I do n't , " sobbed Margo , " but it 's all so awl . . . . Judge Cassidy 's down there , you go and talk to him . . . . " " Poor little girl . Surely I will but it 's you he 'll be wanting to see . . . . You 've en through too much . " " I wo n't go back to the chorus . . . I wo n't , " Margo sobbed . " Oh , no , I would n't like that . . . . But I 'll go down now .... I feel really rested for the first time in months , " said Agnes . When Margo was alone she stopped bawling at once . " Why , I 'm as d as Agnes , " she muttered to herself as she got to her feet . She riled on the water for a bath . It was late by the time she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge looked pretty um . He sat puffing at the butt of a cigar and sipping at a cocktailwhile Agnes talked to him about Faith . Ile perked up when he saw Margo coming down the stairs . She put some dancemusic on the phonograph . " When I 'm in your house I 'm like that famed Grecian sage in the house of the sirens . . . I forget ' tumefies , engagements , everything , " said the judge , coming toward her onestepping . They danced . Agnes went upstairs again . Margop 310could see that the judge was just on the edge of making a pass at her . She was wondering what to do about it when Cliff Wegman was suddenlyushered into the room . The judge gave the young man a scared suspicious look . Margo could see he thought he was going to be framed . " Why , Mr. Wegman , I did n't know you were in Miami . " She took the needle off the record and stopped the phonograph . " Judge Cassidy , meet Mr. Wegman . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to talk about you . I was his personal secretary . " Cliff looked haggardand nervous . " I just pulled into this little old town , " he said . " I hope I 'm not intruding . " He grinned at Margo . " Well , I 'm woiking for the Charles Anderson estate now . " " Poor fellow , " said Judge Cassidy , getting to his feet . " I had the honor of bein ' quite a friend of Lieutenant Anderson 's . . . . " Shaking his head he walked across the soft plumcolored carpet to Margo . " Well , ma dear young lady , you must excuse me . But duty calls . This was indeed delightful . " Margo went out with him to his car . The rosy evening was fading into dusk . A mockingbird was singing in a peppertree beside the house . " When can I bring the jewelry ? " Margo said , leaning towards the judge over the front seat of the car . " Perhaps you better come to my office tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course the appraisal will have to be at the expense of the borrower . " " O.K. and by that time I hope you 'll have thought of some way I can turn it over quick . What 's the use of having a boom if you do n't take advantage of it ? " The judge leaned over to kiss her . His wet lips brushed against her ear as she pulled her head away . " Be yourself , judge , " she said . In the livingroom Cliff was striding up and down fit to be tied . He stopped in his tracks and came towards her with his fists clenched as if he were going to hit her . He was chewing gum ; the thin jaw moving from side to side gave him a face like a sheep . " Well , the boss soitenly done right by little Orphan Annie . " " Well , if that 's all you came down here to tell me you can just get on the train and go back home . " " Look here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On business ? " Margo let herself drop into a pink overstuffed chair . " Sit down , Cliff ... but you did n't need to come barging in here like a process server . Is it about Charley 's estate ? "  | " Estate hell . . . I want you to marry me . The pickin 's are slim right pow but I 've got a big career ahead . " Margo let out a shriek and let her head drop on the back of thechair . She got to laughing and could n't stop laughing . " No , hontly , Cliff , " she spluttered . " But I do n't want to marry anybody just ) w .... Why , Cliff , you sweet kid . I could kiss you . " He came over d tried to hug her . She got to her feet and pushed him away . " I 'm t going to let things like that interfere with my career either . " Cliff frowned . " I wo n't marry an actress . . . . You 'd have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " Not even a movingpicture actress ? " " Aw , hell , all you do is kid and I 'm nuts about you . " He sat down on he davenport and wrung his head between his hands . She moved ver and sat down beside him . " Forget it , Cliff . " Cliff jumped up again . " I can tell you one thing , you wo n't get nywheres fooling around with that old buzzard Cassidy . He 's a maredman and so crooked he has to go through a door edgeways . Hegypped hell out of the boss in that airport deal . Hell .... That 's probablyno news to you . You probably were in on it and got your cut first thing . . . . And then you think it 's a whale of a joke when a guy comes all the way down to the jumpingoff place to offer you the protection f his name . All right , I 'm through . Good . . . night . " He went out slamming the glass doors into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinkled down to the floor . Agnes rushed in from the diningroom . " Oh , how dreadful , " she said . " I was listening . I thought maybe poor Mr. Anderson had left a trustfund for you . " " That boy 's got bats in his belfry , " said Margo . A minute later the phone rang . It was Cliff with tears in his voice , apologizing , asking if he could n't come back to talk it over . " Not on your tintype , " said Margo and hung up . " Well , Agnes , " said Margo as she came from the telephone , " that 's that . . . . We 've got to figure these things out . . . . Cliff 's right about that old fool Cassidy . He never was in the picture anyways . " " Such a dignified man , " said Agnes , making ducking noises with her tongue . Raymond announced dinner . Margo and Agnes ate alone , each at one end of the long mahogany table covered with doilies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 've told that damn girl a hundred times not to do anything to the soup but take it out of the 312can and heat it , " Margo said peevishly . " Oh , Agnes , please do the housekeeping . . . I ca n't get ' em to do anything right . " " Oh , I 'd love to , " said Agnes . " Of course I 've never kept house on a scale like this . " " We 're not going to either , " said Margo . " We 've got to cut down . " " I guess I 'd better write Miss Franklyn to see if she 's got another job for me . " " You just wait a little while , " said Margo . " We can stay on here for a couple months . I 've got an idea it would do Tony good down here . Suppose we send him his ticket to come down ? Do you think he 'd sell it on me and hit the dope again ? " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straightened out completely . " Agnes began to blubber over her plate . " Oh , Margo , what an openhanded girl you are ... just like your poor mother . . . always thinking of others . " When Tony got to Miami he looked pale as a mealyworm but lying on the beach in the sun and dips in the breakers soon got him into fine shape . He was good as gold and seemed very grateful and helped Agnes with the housework , as they 'd let the maids go ; Agnes declared she could n't do anything with them and would rather do the work herself . When men Margo knew came around she introduced him as a Cuban relative . But he and Agnes mostly kept out of sight when she had company . Tony was tickled to death when Margo suggested he learn to drive the car . He drove fine right away , so they could let Raymondgo . One day when he was getting ready to drive her over to meet some big realtors at Cocoanut Grove , Margo suggested , just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's old uniform would n't fit him . He looked fine in it . When she suggested he wear it when he drove her he went into a tantrum , and talked about honor and manhood . She cooled him down saying that the whole thing was a joke and he said , well , if it was a joke , and wore it . Margo could tell he kinder liked the uniform because she saw him looking at himself in it in the pierglass in the hall . Miami realestate was on the skids , but Margo managed to make a hundred thousand dollars ' profit on the options she held ; on paper . The trouble was that she could n't get any cash out of her profits . The twins she 'd met at Coral Gables gave her plenty of advice but she was leery , and advice was all they did give her . They were always around in the evenings and Sundays , eating up everything Agnes had in the icebox and drinking all the liquor and talking big about the good things they were going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sand out of her beachslippers without expecting to find Otte of the twins in it . And they never came across with any parties either , did n't even bring around a bottle of scotch once in a while. nes was kinder soft on them because Al made a fuss over her while Ed was trying to make Margo . One Sunday when they 'd all been lying in the sun on the beach and sopping up cocktails all afternoon Ed broke into Margo 's room when she was dressing after they 'd come in to change out of their bathingsuits and started tearing her wrapper off her . She gave him a poke but he was drunk as a fool and came at her worse than ever . She had to yell for Tony to come in and play the heavy husband . Tony was white as a sheet and trembled all over , but he managed to pick up a chair and was going to crown Ed with it when Al and Agnes came in to see what the racket was about . Al stuck by Ed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pimp and that they were a couple of goddam whores . Margo was scared . They never would have got them out of the house if Agnes had n't gone to the phone and threatened to call the police . The twins said nothing doing , the police were there to run women like them out of town , but they got into their clothes and left and that was the last Margo saw of them . After they 'd gone Tony had a crying fit and said that he was n't a pimp and that this life was impossible and that he 'd kill himself if she did n't give him money to go back to Havana . To get Tony to stay they had to promise to get out of Miami as soon as they could . " Now , Tony , you know you want to go to California , " Agnes kept saying and petting him like a baby . " Sandflies are getting too bad on the beach anyway , " said Margo . She went down in the livingroom and shook up another cocktail for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this dump . Time to pull out , " she said . " I 'm through . " It was a sizzling hot day when they piled the things in the Buick and drove off up U.S. 1 with Tony , not in his uniform but in a new waspwaisted white linen suit , at the wheel . The Buick was so piled with bags and household junk there was hardly room for Agnes in the back seat . Tony 's guitar was slung from the ceiling . Margo 's wardrobetrunkwas strapped on behind . " My goodness , " said Agnes when she came back from the restroom of the fillingstation in West Palm Beach where they 'd stopped for gas , " we look like a traveling tent-show : ' Between them they had about a hundred dollars in cash that 314Margo had turned over to Agnes to keep in her black handbag . The first day Tony would talk about nothing but the hit he 'd make in the movies . " If Valentino can do it , it will be easy for me , " he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profile in the narrow drivingmirrorat the top of the windshield . At night they stopped in touristcamps , all sleeping in one cabin to save money , and ate out of cans . Agnes loved it . She said it was like the old days when they were on the Keith circuit and Margo was a child actress . Margo said child actress hell , it made her feel like an old crone . Towards afternoon Tony would complain of shooting pains in his wrists and Margo would have to drive . Along the gulf coast of Alabama , Mississippi and Louisiana the roads were terrible . It was a relief when they got into Texas , though the weather there was showery . They thought they never would get across the state of Texas , though . Agnes said she did n't know there was so much alfalfa in the world . In El Paso they had to buy two new tires and get the brakes fixed . Agnes began to look worried when she counted over the roll of bills in her purse . The last couple of days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one can of baked beans and a bunch of frankfurters . It was frightfully hot but Agnes would n't even let them get Coca-Cola at the dustylooking drugstores in the farbetween little towns because she said they had to save every cent if they were n't going to hit Los Angeles deadbroke . As they were wallowing along in the dust of the unfinished highway outside of Yuma , a shinylooking S.P. expresstrain passed them , big new highshouldered locomotive , pullmancars , diner , clubcar with girls and men in light suits lolling around on the observation platform . The train passed slowly and the colored porters leaning out from the pullmans grinned and waved . Margo remembered her trips to Florida in a drawingroom and sighed . " Do n't worry , Margie , " chanted Agnes from the back seat . " We 're almost there . " " But where ? Where ? That 's what I want to know , " said Margo , with tears startinginto her eyes . The car went over a bump that almost broke the springs . " Never mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orientations I shall be making thousands a week and we shall travel in a private car . " In Yuma they had to stop in the hotel because the camps were all full and that set them back plenty . They were all in , the three of them , and Margo woke up in the night in a high fever from the heat and p 315dust and fatigue . In the morning the fever was gone , but her eyes were puffed up and red and she looked a sight . Her hair needed washing and was stringy and dry as a handful of tow . The next day they were too tired to enjoy it when they went across the high fragrant mountains and came out into the San Bernardino valley full of wellkept fruittrees , orangegroves that still had a few flowers on them , and coolsmelling irrigation ditches . In San Bernardino Margo said she 'd have to have her hair washed if it was the last thing she did on this earth . They still had twentyfive dollars that Agnes had saved out of the housekeeping money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While Margo and Agnes went to a beautyparlor , they gave Tony a couple of dollars to go around and get the car washed . That night they had a regular fiftycent dinner in a restaurant and went to a movingpicture show . They slept in a nice roomy cabin on the road to Pasadena in a camp the woman at the beautyparlor had told them about , and the next morning they set out early before the white clammy fog had lifted . The road was good and went between miles and miles of orangegroves . By the time they got to Pasadena the sun had come out and Agnes and Margo declared it was the loveliest place they 'd ever seen in their lives . Whenever they passed a particularly beautiful residence Tony would point at it with his finger and say that was where they 'd live as soon as he had made the orientations . They saw signs pointing to Hollywood , but somehow they got through the town without noticing it , and drew up in front of a small rentingoffice in Santa Monica . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the man insisted on a month 's rent in advance , so they drove on . They ended up in a dusty stucco bungalowcourt in the outskirts of Venice where the man seemed impressed by the blue Buick and the wardrobetrunk and let them take a place with only a week paid in advance . Margo thought it was horrid but Agnes was in the highest spirits . She said Venice reminded her of Holland'sin the old days . " That 's what gives me the sick , " said Margo . Tony went in and collapsed on the couch and Margo had to get the neighbors to help carry in the bags and wardrobetrunk . They lived in that bungalow court for more months than Margo ever liked to admit even at the time . Margo registered at the agency as Margo de Garrido . She got takenp316on in society scenes as extra right away on account of her good clothes and a kind of a way of wearing them she had that she 'd picked up at old Piquot 's . Tony sat in the agency and loafed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish or South American picture being cast , wearing a broadbrimmed Cordoba hat he 'd bought at a costumer 's and tightwaisted trousers and sometimes cowboy boots and spurs , but the one thing there always seemed to be enough of was Latin types . He turned morose and peevish and took to driving the car around filled up with simpering young men he 'd picked up , until Margo put her foot down and said it was her car and nobody else 's , and not to bring his fagots around the house either . He got sore at that and walked out , but Agnes , who did the housekeeping and handled all the money Margo brought home , would n't let him have any pocketmoney until he 'd apologized . Tony was away two days and came back looking hungry and hangdog . After that Margo made him wear the old chauffeur 's uniform when he drove her to the lot . She knew that if he wore that he would n't go anywhere after he 'd left her except right home to change and then Agnes could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a long day on the lot to find that he 'd been hanging round the house all day strumming It Ai n't Gon na Rain No More on his guitar , and sleepingand yawning on all the beds and dropping cigaretteashes everywhere . He said Margo had ruined his career . What she hated most about him was the way he yawned . One Sunday , after they had been three years in the outskirts of L.A. , moving from one bungalow to another , Margo getting on the lots fairly consistently as an extra , but never getting noticed by a director , managing to put aside a little money to pay the interest but never getting together enough in a lump sum to bail out her jewelry at the bank in Miami , they had driven up to Altadena in the afternoon ; on the way back they stopped at a garage to get a flat fixed ; out in front of the garage there were some secondhand cars for sale . Margo walked up and down looking at them to have something to do while they were waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , lady ? " said the garage attendant kind of kidding as he pulled the jack out from under the car . Margo climbed into the big black limousine with a red coatofarms on the door and tried the seat . It certainly was comfortable . She leaned out and said , " How much is it ? " " One thousand dollars . . . it 's a gift at the price . " " Cheap at half the price , " said Margo. p 317nes had gotten out of the Buick and come over . " Are you crazy , argie ? " " Maybe , " said Margo and asked how much they 'd allow her if she tided in the Buick . The attendant called the boss , a toadfaced youngan with a monogram on his silk shirt . He and Margo argued backd forth for an hour about the price . Tony tried driving the car andid it ran like a dream . He was all pepped up at the idea of driving a ) lls , even an old one . In the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendollar weekly payments . They signed the contractthen and there , Margo gave Judge Cassidy 's and Tad Whittlesea 's ( fames as references ; they changed the plates and drove home that night in the Rolls-Royce to Santa Monica where they were living at the time . As they turned into Santa Monica Boulevard at Beverly I tills , Margo said carelessly , " Tony , is n't that mailed hand holding a sword very much like the coatofarms of the Counts de Garrido ? " " ' These people out here are so ignorant they would n't know the difference , " said Tony . " We 'll just leave it there , " said Margo . " Sure , " said Blimy , " it looks good . " The other extras surely stared when Tony in his trim grey uniform drove her down to the lot next day , but Margo kept her pokerface . " It 's just the old family bus , " she said when a girl asked her about it . " It 's been in hock . " " Is that your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thumb at Agnes who was driving away sitting up dressed in her best black in the back of the huge shiny car with her nose in the air . " Oh , no , " said Margo coldly . " That 's my companion . " Plenty of men tried to date Margo up , but they were mostly extras or cameramen or propertymen or carpenters and she and Agnes did n't see that it would do her any good to mix up with them . It was a lonely life after all the friends and the guys crazy about her and the business deals and everything in Miami . Most nights she and Agnes just played Russian bank or threehanded bridge if Tony was in and not too illtempered to accommodate . Sometimes they went to the movies or to the beach if it was warm enough . They drove out through the crowds on Hollywood Boulevard nights when there was an opening at Grauman 's Chinese Theater . The Rolls looked so fancy and Margo still had a good eveningdress not too far out of style so t hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in midwinter Margo was feeling particularly desperate because styles had changed so she couldn'tp318wear her old dresses any more and did n't have any money for new ; she jumped up from her seat knocking the pack of solitaire cards onto the floor and shouted to Agnes that she had to have a little blowoutor she 'd go crazy . Agnes said why did n't they drive to Palm Springs to see the new resort hotel . They 'd eat dinner there if it would n't set them back too much and then spend the night at a touristcamp down near the Salton Sea . Give them a chance to get the chill of the Los Angeles fog out of their bones . When they got to Palm Springs Agnes thought everything looked too expensive and wanted to drive right on , but Margo felt in her elementright away . Tony was in his uniform and had to wait for them in the car . He looked so black in the face Margo thought he 'd burst when she told him to go and get himself some supper at a dogwagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorman was right there . They 'd been to the ladies ' room to freshen their faces up and were walking up and down under the big datepalms looking at the people to see if they could recognize any movie actors , when Margo heard a voice that was familiar . A dark thinfaced man in white serge who was chatting with an importantlooking baldheaded Jewish gentleman was staring at her . He left his friend and came up . He had a stiff walk like an officer reviewing a company drawn up at attention . " Miss Dowling , " he said , " how very lucky for both of us . " Margo looked smiling into the twitching sallow face with dark puffs under the eyes . " You 're the photographer , " she said . He stared at her hard . " Sam Margolies , " he said . " Well , I 've searched all over America and Europe for-you .... Please be in my officefor a screentest at ten o'clock tomorrow . . . . Irwin will give you the details ? ' He waved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Harris . . . Miss Dowling . . . forgive me , I never take upon myself the responsibility of introducing people . . . . But I want Irwin to see you . . . this is one of the most beautiful women in America , Irwin " He drew his hand down in front of Margo a couple of inches from her face working the fingers as if he were modeling something out of clay . " Ordinarily it would be impossible to photograph her . Only I can put that face on the screen .... " Margo felt cold all up her spine . She heard Agnes 's mouth come open with a gasp behind her . She let a slow kidding smile start in the corners of her mouth . " Look , Irwin , " cried Margolies , grabbing the fat man by the shoulder . " It is the spirit of comedy . . . . But why did n't you come to see me ? " He ) ke with a strong foreign accent of some kind . " What have I done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This is Mrs. Mandeville , my . . . companion . . . . We are taking a little look at California " " What 's there here except the studios ? " " Perhaps you 'd show Mrs. Mandeville around a movingpicture udio . She 's so anxious to see one , and I do n't know a soul in this Part of the world . . . not a soul . " " Of course I 'll have someone take you to all you care to see tomor- ) w . Nothing to see but dullness and vulgarity . . . . Irwin , that 's the ice I 've been looking for for the little blonde girl . . . you remember .... You talk to me of agencies , extras , nonsense , I do n't want actors .... But , Miss Dowling , where have you been ? I halfexpected to meet you at Baden-Baden last summer . . . . You are the type for Baden-Baden . It 's a ridiculous place but one has to go somewhere ... . Where have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . that sort of thing . " Margo was thinking to herself that the last time she met him he had n't been using the broad a . " And you 've given up the stage ? " Margo gave a little shrug . " The family were so horrid about it . " " Oh , I never liked her being on the stage , " cried Agnes who 'd been waiting for a chance to put a word in . " You 'll like working in pictures , " said the fat man soothingly . " My dear Margo , " said Margolies , " it is not a very large part but you are perfect for it , perfect . I can bring out in you the latent mystery . . . . Did n't I tell you , Irwin , that the thing to do was to go out of the studio and see the world . . . open the book of life ? . . . In this ridiculous caravanserai we find the face , the spirit of comedy , the smile of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to be worth five million dollars ... . Do n't ask me how I knew she would be here . . . . But I knew . Of course we can not tell definitely until after the screentest . . . I never commit myself .... " " But , Mr. Margolies , I do n't know if I can do it , " Margo said , her heart pounding . " We 're in a rush . . . . We have important business to attend to in Miami ... family matters , you understand . " " That 's of no importance . I 'll find you an agent . . . we 'll send somebody . . . . Petty details are of no importance to me . Realestate , I suppose.  |p320Margo  nodded vaguely . " A couple of years ago the house where we 'd been living , it was so lovely , was washed clear out to sea , " said Agnes breathlessly . " You 'll get a better house . . . Malibu Beach , Beverly Hills . . . . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rude , I have detained you .... But you will forget Miami . We have everything out here . . . . You remember , Margo dearest , I told you that day that pictures had a great future . . . you and ... you know , the great automobile magnate , I have forgotten his name . . . I told you you would hear of me in the pictures .... I rarely make predictions , but I am never wrong . They are based on belief in a sixth sense . " " Oh , yes , " interrupted Agnes , " it 's so true , if you believe you 're goingto succeed you ca n't fail , that 's what I tell Margie .... " " Very beautifully said , dear lady . . . . Miss Dowling darling , ContinentalAttractions at ten . . . . I 'll have somebody stationed at the gate so that they 'll let your chauffeur drive right to my office . It is impossible to reach me by phone . Even Irwin ca n't get at me when I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to see me at work . " " Well , if I can manage it and my chauffeur can find the way . " " You 'll come , " said Margolies and dragged Irwin Harris away by one short white flannel arm into the diningroom . Welldressed people stared after them as they went . Then they were staring at Margo and Agnes . " Let 's go to the dogwagon and tell Tony . They 'll just think we are eccentric , " whispered Margo in Agnes 's ear . " I declare I never imagined that Margolies was him . " " Oh , is n't it wonderful , " said Agnes . They were so excited they could n't eat . They drove back to Santa Monica that night and Margo went straight to bed so as to be rested for the next morning . Next morning when they got to the lot at a quarter of ten Mr. Margolies had n't sent word . Nobody had heard of an appointment . They waited half an hour . Agnes was having trouble keeping back the tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was full of hop or something and forgot all about it . " But she felt sick inside . Tony had just started the motor and was about to pull away because Margo did n't like being seen waiting at the gate like that when a white Pierce Arrow custombuilt towncar with Margolies all in white flannel with a white beret sitting alone in the back drove up alongside . He was peeringinto the Rolls-Royce and she could see him start with surprisep321when he recognized her . He tapped on the window of his car with a porcelainheaded cane . Then he got out of his car and reached in and took Margo by the hand . " I never apologize . . . . It is often necessary Iilr me to keep people waiting . You will come with me . Perhaps your friend will call for you at five o'clock . . . . I have much to tell you and to show you . " They went upstairs in the elevator in a long plainfaced building . I le ushered her through several offices where young men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , actors were waiting on benches . " Frieda , a screentest for Miss Dowling right away , please , " he said as he passed a secretary at a big desk in the last room . Then he ushered her into his own office hung with Chinese paintings and a single big carved gothic chair set in the glare of a babyspot opposite a huge carved gothic desk . " Sit there , please .... Margo darling , how can I explain to you the pleasure of a face unsmirched by the camera ? I can see that there is no strain ... . You do not care . Celtic freshness combined with insouciance of noble Spain .... I can see that you 've never been before a camera before ... . Excuse me . " He sank in the deep chair behind his desk and started telephoning . Every now and then a stenographer came and took notes that he recited to her in a low voice . Margo sat and sat . She thought Margolies had forgotten her . The room was warm and stuffy and began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes open when Margolies jumped up from his desk and said , " Come , darling , we 'll go down now . " Margo stood around for a while in front of some cameras in a plasterysmelling room in the basement and then Margolies took her to lunch at the crowded restaurant on the lot . She could feel that everybody was looking up from their plates to see who the new girl was that Margolies was taking to lunch . While they ate he asked her questionsabout her life on a great sugarplantation in Cuba , and her debutantegirlhood in New York . Then he talked about Carlsbad and Baden-Baden and Marienbad and how Southern California was gettingover its early ridiculous vulgarity : " We have everything here that you can find anywhere , " he said . After lunch they went to see the rushes in the projectionroom . Mr. Harris turned up too , smoking a cigar . Nobody said anything as they looked at Margo 's big grey and white face , grinning , turning , smirking , mouth opening and closing , head tossing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it , though she loved still photographs of herself . She could n't get used to its being so big . Now and then Mr. Harris would grunt and the end of his cigar would glow red . Margo felt relieved when the film was over and they were in the dark again . Then the lights were on and they were filing out of the projectionroompast a redfaced operator in shirtsleeves who had thrown open the door to the little black box where the machine was and gave Margo a look as she passed . Margo could n't make out whether he thought she was good or not . On the landing of the outside staircase Margolies put out his hand coldly and said , " Goodby , dearest Margo . . . . There are a hundred people waiting for me . " Margo thought it was all off . Then he went on , " You and Irwin will make the business arrangements . . . I have no understanding of those matters . . . . I 'm sure you 'll have a very pleasantafternoon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he went . Mr. Harris explained that Mr. Margolies would let her know when he wanted her and that meanwhile they would work out the contract . Did she have an agent ? If she did n't he would recommend that they call in his friend Mr. Hardbein to protect her interests . When she got into the office with Mr. Harris sitting across the desk from her and Mr. Hardbein , a hollowfaced man with a tough kidding manner , sitting beside her , she found herself reading a threeyearcontract at three hundred a week . " Oh , dear , " she said , " I 'm afraid I 'd be awfully tired of it after that length of time . . . . Do you mind if I ask my companion Mrs. Mandeville to come around ? .. . I 'm so ignorant about these things . " Then she called up Agnes and they fiddled around talking about the weather until Agnes got there . Agnes was wonderful . She talked about commitments and importantbusiness to be transacted and an estate to care for , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Dowling 's while to give up her world cruise , would it , darling , if she appeared in the picture anywayit was only to accommodate an old friend Mr. Margolies and of course Miss Dowling had always made sacrifices for her work , and that she herself made sacrifices for it and if necessary would work her fingers to the bone to give her a chance to have the kind of success she believed in and that she knew she would have because if you believed with an unsullied heart God would bring things about the way they ought to be . Agnes went on to talk about how awful unbelief was and 323at five o'clock just as the office was closing they went out to the car with a contract for three months at five hundred a week in Agnes 's handbag . " I hope the stores are still open , " Margo was saying . " I 've sot to have some clothes . " A toughlooking greyfaced man in ridingclothes with light tow hair was sitting in the front seat beside Tony . Margo and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they got into the car . " Take us down to 7asker and Harding 's on Hollywood Boulevard . . . the Paris Gown Shop , " Agnes said . " Oh , goody , it 'll be lovely to have you have some new clothes , " she whispered in Margo 's ear . When Tony let the stranger off at the corner of Hollywood and Sunset , he bowed stiffly and started off up the broad sidewalk . " Tony , I do n't know how many times I 've told you you could n't pick up your friends in my car , " began Margo . She and Agnes nagged at him so that when he got home he was in a passion and said that he was moving out next day . " You have done nothing but exploit me and interfere with my career . That was Max Hirsch . He 's an Austrian count and a famous poloplayer . " Next day sure enough Tony packed his things and left the house . The five hundred a week did n't go as far as Agnes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took ten percent of it first thing , then Agnes insisted on depositing fifty to pay off the loan in Miami so that Margo could get her jewelry back . Then moving into a new house in the nice part of Santa Monica cost a lot . There was a cook and a housemaid 's wages to pay and they had to have a chauffeurnow that Tony had gone . And there were clothes and a publicitymanand all kinds of charities and handouts around the studio that you could n't refuse . Agnes was wonderful . She attended to everything . Whenever any business matter came up Margo would press her fingers to the two sides of her forehead and let her eyes close for a minute and groan . " It 's too bad but I just have n't got a head for business . " It was Agnes who picked out the new house , a Puerto Rican cottage with the cutest balconies , jampacked with antique Spanish furniture . In the evening Margo sat in an easychair in the big livingroom in front of an open fire playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from actors and people Margo met on the lot , but Margo said she was n't going out until she found out what was what in this town . " First thing you know we 'll be going around with a bunch ofp 324bums who 'll do us more harm than good . " " How true that is , " sighed Agnes . " Like those awful twins in Miami . " They did n't see anything of Tony until , one Sunday night that Sam Margolies was coming to the house for the first time , he turned up drunk at about six o'clock and said that he and Max Hirsch wanted to start a polo school and that he had to have a thousand dollars right away . " But , Tony , " said Agnes , " where 's Margie going to get it ? . . . You know just as well as I do how heavy our expenses are . " Tony made a big scene , stormed and cried and said Agnes and Margo had ruined his stage career and that now they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been too patient , " he yelled , tapping himself on the chest . " I have let myself be ruined by women . " Margo kept looking at the clock on the mantel . It was nearly seven . She finally shelled out twentyfive bucks and told him to come back during the week . " He 's hitting the hop again , " she said after he 'd gone . " He 'll go crazy one of these days . " " Poor boy , " sighed Agnes , " he 's not a bad boy , only weak . " " What I 'm scared of is that that heinie 'll get hold of him and make us a lot of trouble .... That bird had a face like state 's prison . . . guess the best thing to do is get a lawyer and start a divorce . " " But think of the publicity , " wailed Agnes . " Anyway , " said Margo , " Tony 's got to pass out of the picture . I 've taken all I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour late . " How peaceful , " he was saying . " How can you do it in delirious Hollywood ? " " Why , Margie 's just a quiet little working girl , " said Agnes , picking up her sewingbasket and starting to sidle out . He sat down in the easychair without taking off his white beret and stretched out his bowlegs towards the fire . " I hate the artificiality of it . " " Do n't you now ? " said Agnes from the door . Margo offered him a cocktail but he said he did n't drink . When the maid brought out the dinner that Agnes had worked on all day he would n't eat anything but toast and lettuce . " I never eat or drink at mealtimes . I come only to look and to talk . " " That 's why you 've gotten so thin , " kidded Margo . " Do you remember the way I used to be in those old days ? My New York period . Let 's not talk about it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now I am thinking of the picture you are going to star in . I never go to parties but you must come with me to Irwin Harris 's tonight . There will be people there you 'll have to know . Let me see your dresses . I 'll pick out what you ought to wear. p 325After this you must always let me come when you buy a dress . " Followingher up the creaking stairs to her bedroom he said , " We must have a different setting for you . This wo n't do . This is suburban . " Margo felt funny driving out through the avenues of palms of Beverly Hills sitting beside Sam Margolies . He 'd made her put on the old yellow eveningdress she 'd bought at Piquot 's years ago that Agnes had recently had done over and lengthened by a little French dressmakershe 'd found in Los Angeles . Her hands were cold and she was afraid Margolies would hear her heart knocking against her ribs . She tried to think of something funny to say but what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was thinking . She could see his face , the narrow forehead under his black bang , the pouting lips , the beaklike profile very dark against the streetlights as he sat stiffly beside her with his hands on his knees . He still had on his white flannels and a white stock with a diamond pin in it in the shape of a golfclub . As the car turned into a drive towards a row of bright tall frenchwindows through the trees he turned to her and said , " You are afraid you will be bored . . . . You 'll be surprised . You 'll find we have something here that matches the foreign and New York society you are accustomed to . " As he turned his face towards her the light glinted on the whites of his eyes and sagging pouches under them and the wet broad lips . He went on whispering squeezing her hand as he helped her out of the car . " You will be the most elegant woman there but only as one star is brighter than the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margo caught herself starting to giggle . " How you do go on , " she said . " You talk like a . . . like a genius . " " That 's what they call me , " said Margolies in a loud voice drawinghis shoulders back and standing stiffly at attention to let her go past him through the large glass doors into the vestibule . The worst of it was going into the dressingroom to take off her wraps . The women who were doing their faces and giving a last pat to their hair all turned and gave her a quick onceover that started at her slippers , ran up her stockings , picked out every hook and eye of her dress , ran round her neck to see if it was wrinkled and up into her hair to see if it was dyed . At once she knew that she ought to have an ermine wrap . There was one old dame standing smoking a cigarette by the lavatory door in a dress all made of cracked ice who had xray eyes ; Margo felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maid gave Margo a nice toothy grin as she laid Margo 's coat over herP326arm that made her feel better . When she went out she felt the stares clash together on her back and hang there like a tin can on a dog 's tail . Keep a stiff upper lip , they ca n't eat you , she was telling herself as the door of the ladies ' room closed behind her . She wished Agnes was there to tell her how lovely everybody was . Margolies was waiting for her in the vestibule full of sparkly chandeliers . There was an orchestra playing and they were dancing in a big room . He took her to the fireplace at the end . Irwin Harris and Mr. Hardbein who looked as alike as a pair of eggs in their tight dress suits came up and said goodevening . Margolies gave them each a hand without looking at them and sat down by the fireplace with his back to the crowd in a big carved chair like the one he had in his office . Mr. Harris asked her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other collection of dressedup people . At least until she found herself dancing with Rodney Cathcart . She recognized him at once from the pictures , but it was a shock to find that his face had color in it , and that there was warm blood and muscle under his rakish eveningdress . He was a tall tanned young man with goldfishyellow hair and an English way of mumbling his words . She 'd felt cold and shivery until she started to dance with him . After he 'd danced with her once he asked her to dance with him again . Between dances he led her to the buffet at the end of the room and tried to get her to drink . She held a scotch and soda in a big blue glass each time and just sipped it while he drank down a couple of scotches straight and ate a large plate of chicken salad . He seemed a little drunk but he did n't seem to be getting any drunker . He did n't say anything so she did n't say anything either . She loved dancing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the room she caught sight of the whole room in the huge mirror over the fireplace . Once when she got just the right angle she thought she saw Margolies ' face staring at her from out of the carved highbacked chair that faced the burning logs . He seemed to be staring at her attentively . The firelight playing on his face gave it a warm lively look she had n't noticed on it before . Immediately blond heads , curly heads , bald heads , bare shoulders , black shoulders got in her way and she lost sight of that corner of the room . It must have been about twelve o'clock when she found him standing beside the table where the scotch was . " Hello , Sam , " said RodneyP327Cathcart . " How 's every little thing ? " " We must go now , the poor childtired in all this noise .... Rodney , you must let Miss Dowling go now . " O.K. , pal , " said Rodney Cathcart and turned his back to pour himself another glass of scotch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hardbein waiting for her in the vestibule . He bowed as he squeezed hcr hand . " Well , I do n't mind telling you , Miss Dowling , that you made a sensation . The girls are all asking what you use to dye your hair with . " A laugh rumbled down into his broad vest . " Would you come by my office ? We might have a bite of lunch and talk things over  --  bit . " Margo gave a little shudder . " It 's sweet of you , Mr. Hardbein , but I never go to offices . . . I do n't understand business . . . . You call us up , wo n't you ? " When she got out to the colonial porch there was Rodney Cathcart sitting beside Margolies in the long white car . Margo grinned and got in between them as cool as if she 'd expected to find Rodney Cathcart there all the while . The car drove off . Nobody said anything . She could n't tell where they were going , the avenues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They stopped at a big restaurant . " I thought we 'd better have a little snack . . . . You did n't eat anythingall evening , " Margolies said , giving her hand a squeeze as he helped her out of the car . " That 's the berries , " said Rodney Cathcart who 'd hopped out first . " This dawncing makes a guy beastly ' ungry . ' The headwaiter bowed almost to the ground and led them through the restaurant full of eyes to a table that had been reserved for them on the edge of the dancefloor . Margolies ate shreddedwheat biscuits and milk , Rodney Cathcart ate a steak and Margo took on the end of her fork a few pieces of a lobsterpatty . " A blighter needs a drink after t hat , " grumbled Rodney Cathcart , pushing back his plate after polishingoff the last fried potato . Margolies raised two fingers . " Here it is forbidden .... How silly we are in this country . . . . How silly they are . " He rolled his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it just a twitch of the eyelid and gave him that slow stopped smile he 'd made such a fuss over at Palm Springs . Margolies got to his feet . " Come , Margo darling . . . I have something to show you . " As she and Rodney Cathcart followed him out across the red carpet she could feel ripples of excitement go through the people in the restaurant the way she 'd felt it when she went places in Miami after Charley Andersonhad been killed . P 328Margolies drove them to a big creamcolored apartmenthouse . They went up in an elevator . He opened a door with a latchkey and ushered them in . " This , " he said , " is my little bachelor flat . " It was a big dark room with a balcony at the end hung with embroideries . The walls were covered with all kinds of oilpaintings each lit by a little overhead light of its own . There were oriental rugs piled one on the other on the floor and couches round the walls covered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful place , " said Margo . Margolies turned to her , smiling . " A bit baronial , eh ? The sort of thing you 're accustomed to see in the castle of a Castilian grandee . " " Absolutely , " said Margo . Rodney Cathcart lay down full length on one of the couches . " Say , Sam old top , " he said , " have you got any of that good Canadian ale ? ' Ow about a little Guinness in it ? " Margolies went out into a pantry and the swinging door closed behind him . Margo roamed around looking at the brightcolored picturesand the shelves of wriggling Chinese figures . It made her feel spooky . " Oh , I say , " Rodney Cathcart called from the couch . " Come over here , Margo . . . . I like you .... You 've got to call me Si . . . . My friends call me that . It 's more American . " " All right by me , " said Margo , saunteringtowards the couch . Rodney Cathcart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pal , " he said . When she put her hand in his he grabbed it and tried to pull her towards him on the couch . " Would n't you like to kiss me , Margo ? " He had a terrific grip . She could feel how strong he was . Margolies came back with a tray with bottles and glasses and set it on an ebony stand near the couch . " This is where I do my work , " he said . " Genius is helpless without the proper environment . . . . Sit there . " He pointed to the couch where Cathcart was lying . " I shot that lion myself . . . . Excuse me a moment . " He went up the stairs to the balcony and a light went on up there . Then a door closed and the light was cut off . The only light in the room was over the pictures . Rodney Cathcart sat up on the edge of the couch . " For crissake , sister , drink something . . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can give me a spot of gin , " she said and sat down beside him on the couch . He was attractive . She found herself letting him kiss her but right away his hand was working up her leg and she had to get up and walk over to the other side of the room to look at the pictures again . " Oh , do n't be silly , " he sighed , letting himself drop back on the couch . There was no sound from upstairs . Margo began to get the jeebiesP 329wondering what Margolies was doing up there . She went back to the touch to get herself another spot of gin and Rodney Cathcart jumped up all of a sudden and put his arms around her from behind and bit hrr ear . " Quit that caveman stuff , " she said , standing still . She did n't want to wrestle with him for fear he 'd muss her dress . " That 's me , " he whispered in her ear . " I find you most exciting . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his hand . Margo wondered how long he 'd been there . Rodney Cathcartlet himself drop back on the couch and closed his eyes . " Now it down , Margo darling , " Margolies was saying in an even voice . " I want to tell you a story . See if it awakens anything in you . " Margo felt herself flushing . Behind her Rodney Cathcart was giving long deep breaths as if he were asleep . " You are tired of the giddy whirl of the European capitals , " Margolies was saying . " You are the daughter of an old armyofficer . Your mother is dead . You go everywhere , dances , dinners , affairs . Proposalsare made for your hand . Your father is a French or perhaps a Spanish general . His country calls him . He is to be sent to Africa to repel the barbarous Moors . He wants to leave you in a convent but you insist on going with him . You are following this ? " " Oh , yes , " said Margo eagerly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him to the war . " " On the same boat there 's a young American collegeboy who has run away to join the foreign legion . We 'll get the reason later . That 'll he your friend Si . You meet . . . . Everything is lovely between you . Your father is very ill . By this time you are in a mud fort besieged by natives , howling bloodthirsty savages . Si breaks through the blockade to get the medicine necessary to save your father 's life . . . . On his returnhe 's arrested as a deserter . You rush to Tangier to get the Americanconsul to intervene . Your father 's life is saved . You ride back just in time to beat the firingsquad . Si is an American citizen and is decorated . The general kisses him on both cheeks and hands his lovely daughter over into his strong arms . . . . I do n't want you to talk about this now .... Let it settle deep into your mind . Of course it 's only a rudimentarysketch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain opportunities . I can see you risking all , reputation , life itself to save the man you love . Now I 'll take you home . . . . Look , Si 's asleep . He 's just an animal , a brute blond beast . " When Margolies put her wrap around her he let his hands rest for ap 330moment on her shoulders . " There 's another thing I want you to let sink into your heart . . . not your intelligence . . . your heart . . . . Do n't answer me now . Talk it over with your charming companion . A little later , when we have this picture done I want you to marry me . I am free . Years ago in another world I had a wife as men have wives but we agreed to misunderstand and went our ways . Now I shall be too busy . You have no conception of the intense detailed work involved . When I am directing a picture I can think of nothing else , but when the creativelabor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you to marry me . . . . Do n't reply now . " They did n't say anything as he sat beside her on the way home to Santa Monica driving slowly through the thick white clammy morningmist . When the car drove up to her door she leaned over and tapped him on the cheek . " Sam , " she said , " you 've given me the loveliestevening . " Agnes was all of a twitter about where she 'd been so late . She was walking around in her dressinggown and had the lights on all over the house . " I had a vague brooding feeling after you 'd left , Margie . So I called up Madame Esther to ask her what she thought . She had a message for me from Frank . You know she said last time he was trying to break through unfortunate influences . " " Oh , Agnes , what did it say ? " " It said success is in your grasp , be firm . Oh , Margie , you 've just got to marry him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . " " Jiminycrickets , " said Margo , falling on her bed when she got upstairs , " I 'm all in . Be a darling and hang up my clothes for me , Agnes . " Margo was too excited to sleep . The room was too light . She kept seeing the light red through her eyelids . She must get her sleep . She 'd look a sight if she did n't get her sleep . She called to Agnes to bring her an aspirin . Agnes propped her up in bed with one hand and gave her the glass of water to wash the aspirin down with the other ; it was like when she 'd been a little girl and Agnes used to give her medicine when she was sick . Then suddenly she was dreaming that she was just finishingthe Everybody 's Doing It number and the pink cave of faces was roaring with applause and she ran off into the wings where Frank Mandeville was waiting for her in his black cloak with his arms stretched wide open , and she ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was down with the cloak choking her and he wasP331on top of her clawing at her dress and past his shoulder she could see ' luny laughing , Tony all in white with a white beret and a diamond golfclub on his stock jumping up and down and clapping . It must have been her yelling that brought Agnes . No , Agnes was telling her something . She sat up in bed shuddering . Agnes was all in a fluster . " Oh , it 's dreadful . Tony 's down there . He insists on seeing you , Margie . He 's been reading in the papers . You know it 's all over the papers about how you are starring with Rodney Cathcart in Mr. Margolies ' next picture . Tony 's wild . He says he 's your husband and he ought to attend to your business for you . He says he 's got a legal right . " " The little rat , " said Margo . " Bring him up here . . . . What time is it ? " She jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face . When she heard them coming up the stairs she pulled on her pink lace bedjacket and jumped back into bed . She was very sleepy when Tony came in the room . " What 's the trouble , Tony ? " she said . " I 'm starving and here you are making three thousand a week ... . Yesterday Max and I had no money for dinner . We are going to be put out of our apartment . By rights everything you make is mine . . . . I 've been too soft . . . I 've let myself be cheated . " Margo yawned . " We 're not in Cuba , dearie . " She sat up in bed . " Look here , Tony , let 's part friends . The contract is n't signed yet . Supposewhen it is we fix you up a little so that you and your friend can go and start your polo school in Havana . The trouble with you is you 're homesick . " " Would n't that be wonderful , " chimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . with all the tourists going down there and everything " Tony drew himself up stiffly . " Margo , we are Christians . We believe . We know that the church forbids divorce . . . . Agnes she does n't un-derstand . " " I 'm a lot better Christian than you are . . . you know that you ... " began Agnes shrilly . " Now , Agnes , we ca n't argue about religion before breakfast ? ' Margo sat up and drew her knees up to her chin underneath the covers . " Agnes and I believe that Mary Baker Eddy taught the truth , see , Tony . Sit down here , Tony .... You 're getting too fat , Tony , the boys wo n't like you if you lose your girlish figure . . . . Look here , you and me we 've seen each other through some tough times . " He sat on theP 332bed and lit a cigarette . She stroked the spiky black hair off his forehead . " You 're not going to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ever had in my life . " " I been a louse . I 'm no good , " Tony said . " How about a thousand a month ? That 's only a third of what you make . You 'll just waste it . Women do n't need money . " " Like hell they do n't . You know it costs money to make money in this business . " " All right . . . make it five hundred . I do n't understand the figures , you know that . You know I 'm only a child . " " Well , I do n't either . You and Agnes go downstairs and talk it over while I get a bath and get dressed . I 've got a dressmaker coming and I 've got to have my hair done . I 've got about a hundred appointments this afternoon . . . . Good boy , Tony . " She patted him on the cheek and he went away with Agnes meek as a lamb . When Agnes came upstairs again after Margo had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margie , we ought to have divorced Tony long ago . This German who 's got hold of him is a bad egg . You know how Mr. Hays feels about scandals . " " I know I 've been a damn fool . " " I 've got to ask Frank about this . I 've got an appointment with MadameEsther this afternoon . Frank might tell us the name of a reliable lawyer . " " We ca n't go to Vardaman . He 's Mr. Hardbein 's lawyer and Sam 's lawyer too . A girl sure is a fool ever to put anything in writing . " The phone rang . It was Mr. Hardbein calling up about the contract . Margo sent Agnes down to the office to talk to him . All afternoon , standing there in front of the long pierglass while the dressmaker fussed around her with her mouth full of pins she was worrying about what to do . When Sam came around at five to see the new dresses her hair was still in the dryer . " How attractive you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " and the lacy negligee and the littletriangle of Brussels lace between your knees . . . . I shall remember it . I have total recall , I never forget anything I 've seen . That is the secretof visual imagination . " When Agnes came back for her in the Rolls she had trouble getting away from Sam . He wanted to take them wherever they were going in his own car . " You must have no secrets from me , Margo darling , " heP 333said gently . " You will see I understand everything . . . everything .... I know you better than you know yourself . That 's why I know I can directyou . I have studied every plane of your face and of your beautiful little girlish soul so full of desire . . . . Nothing you do can surprise or shock me . " " That 's good , " said Margo. lle went away sore . " Oh , Margie , you ought n't to treat Mr. Margolies like that , " whined Agnes . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " said Margo . " He 's got to have a new star . They say he 's pretty near on the skids anyway . " " Mr. Hardbein says that 's just because he 's fired his publicityman , " said Agnes . It was late when they got started . Madame Esther 's house was way downtown in a dilapidated part of Los Angeles . They had the chauffeurlet them out two blocks from the house and walked to it down an alley between dusty bungalow courts like the places they 'd lived in when they first came out to the coast years ago . Margo nudged Agnes . " Remind you of anything ? " Agnes turned to her , frowning . " We must only remember the pleasant beautiful things , Margie . " Madame Esther 's house was a big old frame house with wide porches and cracked shingle roofs . The blinds were drawn on all the grimy windows . Agnes knocked at a little groundglass door in back . A thin spinsterish woman with grey bobbed hair opened it immediately . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in a state . They do n't like to be kept waiting . It 'll be difficult to break the chain . " " Has she had anything from Frank ? " whispered Agnes . " He 's very angry . I 'm afraid he wo n't answer again . . . . Give me your hand . " The woman took Agnes 's hand and Agnes took Margo 's hand and they went in single file down a dark passageway that had only a small red bulb burning in it , and through a door into a completely dark room that was full of people breathing and shuffling . " I thought it was going to be private , " whispered Margo . " Shush , " hissed Agnes in her ear . When her eyes got accustomed to the darknessshe could see Madame Esther 's big puffy face swaying across a huge round table and faint blurs of other faces around it . They made way for Agnes and Margo and Margo found herself sitting down with somebody 's wet damp hand clasped in hers . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pads of white paper . Everything was quiet except for Agnes 's heavy breathing next to her . It seemed hours before anything happened . Then Margo saw that Madame Esther 's eyes were open but all she could see was the whites . A deep baritone voice was coming out of her lips talking a languageshe did n't understand . Somebody in the ring answered in the same language , evidently putting questions . " That 's Sidi Hassan the Hindu , " whispered Agnes . " He 's given some splendid tips on the stockmarket " " Silence , " yelled Madame Esther in a shrill woman 's voice that almostscared Margo out of her wits . " Frank is waiting . No , he has been called away . He left a message that all would be well . He left a message that tomorrow he would impart the information the parties desired and that his little girl must on no account take any step without consultingher darling Agnes . " Agnes burst into hysterical sobs and a hand tapped Margo on the shoulder . The same greyhaired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had some smellingsalts that she made Agnes sniff . Beforeshe opened the groundglass door she said , " That 'll be fifty dollars , please . Twentyfive dollars each . . . . And Madame says that the beautiful girl must not come any more , it might be dangerous for her , we are surrounded by hostile influences . But Mrs. Mandeville must come and get the messages . Nothing can harm her , Madame says , because she has the heart of a child . " As they stepped out into the dark alley to find that it was already night and the lights were on everywhere Margo pulled her fur up round her face so that nobody could recognize her . " You see , Margie , " Agnes said as they settled back into the deep seat of the old Rolls , " everything is going to be all right , with dear Frank watching over us . He means that you must go ahead and marry Mr. Margolies right away . " " Well , I suppose it 's no worse than signing a threeyear contract , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as fast as he could because Sam was taking her to an opening at Grauman 's that night . When they drove up round the drive to the door , the first thing they saw was Tony and Max Hirsch sitting on the marble bench in the garden . " I 'll talk to them , " said Agnes . Margo rushed upstairs and started to dress . She was sitting looking at herself in the glass in her stepins when Tony rushed into the room . When he got into the lightP 335over the dressingtable she noticed that he had a black eye . " Taking upthe gentle art , eh , Tony ? " she said without turning around. ' limy talked breathlessly . " Max blacked my eye because I did not punt to come . Margo , he will kill me if you do n't give me one thousanddollars . We will not leave the house till you give us a check and We got to have some cash too , because Max is giving a party tonight and the bootlegger will not deliver the liquor until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a divorce . How can you ? There is no divorce under the church . It 's a sin that I will not have on my soul . You can not get a divorce . " Margo got up and turned around to face him . " Hand me my negligeeon the bed there . . . no use catching my death of cold . . . . Say , ' luny , do you think I 'm getting too fat ? I gained two pounds last week .... Look here , Tony , that squarehead 's going to be the ruination of you . You better cut him out and go away for another cure somewhere . I 'd hate to have the federal dicks get hold of you on a narcotic charge . They made a big raid in San Pedro only yesterday . " Tony burst into tears . " You 've got to give it to me . He 'll break every bone in my body . " Margo looked at her wristwatch that lay on the dressingtable beside the big powderbox . Eight o'clock . Sam would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , " but next time this house is going to be guarded by detectives . . . . Get that , " she said . " And any monkeybusiness and you birds land in jail . If you think Sam Margolies ca n't keep it out of the papers you 've got another think coming . Go downstairs and tell Agnes to make you out a check and give you any cash she has in the house . " Margo went back to her dressing . A few minutes later Agnes came up crying . " What shall we do ? I gave them the check and two hundred dollars .... Oh , it 's awful . Why did n't Frank warn us ? I know he 's watching over us but he might have told us what to do about that dreadful man . " Margo went into her dresscloset and slipped into a brand new eveninggown . " What we 'll do is stop that check first thing in the morning . You call up the homeprotection office and get two detectives out here on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's all . " Margo was mad , she was striding up and down the room in her new white spangly dress with a trimming of ostrich feathers . She caught sight of herself in the big triple mirror standing between theP336beds . She went over and stood in front of it . She looked at the three views of herself in the white spangly dress . Her eyes were a flashing blue and her cheeks were flushed . Agnes came up behind her bringingher the rhinestone band she was going to wear in her hair . " Oh , Margie , " she cried , " you never looked so stunning . " The maid came up to say that Mr. Margolies was waiting . Margo kissed Agnes and said , " You wo n't be scared with the detectives , will you , dearie ? " Margo pulled the ermine wrap that they 'd sent up on approval that afternoon round her shoulders and walked out to the car . Rodney Cathcart was there lolling in the back seat in his dressclothes . A set of perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her . Sam had got out to help her in , " Margo darling , you take our breaths away , I knew that was the right dress , " he said . His eyes were brighter than usual . " Tonight 's a very important night . It is the edict of the stars . I 'll tell you about it later . I 've had our horoscopescast . " In the crowded throbbing vestibule Margo and Rodney Cathcart had to stop at the microphone to say a few words about their new picture and their association with Sam Margolies as they went in through the beating glare of lights and eyes to the lobby . When the master of ceremonies tried to get Margolies to speak he turned his back angrily and walked into the theater as if it was empty , not looking to the right or the left . After the show they went to a restaurant and sat at a table for a while . Rodney Cathcart ordered some kidneychops . " You must n't eat too much , Si , " said Margolies . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough there was a big table set out with cold salmon and lobstersalad and a Filipino butler opening champagne for just the three of them when they went back there after the restaurant had started to thin out . This time Margo tore loose and ate and drank all she could hold . Rodney Cathcart put away almost the whole salmon , muttering that it was topping , and even Sam , saying he was sure it would kill him , ate a plate of lobstersalad . Margo was dizzygiggly drunk when she found that the Filipino and Sam Margolies had disappeared and that she and Si were sitting together on the couch that had the lionskin on it . " So you 're going to marry Sam , " said Si , gulping down a glass of champagne . She nodded . " Good girl . " Si took off his coat and vest and hung them carefully on a chair . " Hate clothes , " he said . " You must come to my ranch ... . P 337 A lot stuff . " " But you wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " fund Si . I le reached over and lifted her onto his knee . " But , Si , we ought n't to , not on Sam 's lionskin . " Si put his mouth to hers and kissed her . " You find me exciting ? You ought to see me stripped . " " Do n't , do n't , " raid Margo . She could n't help it , he was too strong , his hands were all over her under her dress . " Oh , hell , I do n't give a damn , " she said . He went over and got her another glass of champagne . For himself he filled a bowl that had held cracked ice earlier in the evening . " As for that lion it 's bloody rot . Sam shot it but the blighter shot it in a zoo . They were sellin ' off some old ones at one of the bloody lionfarms and they had a shoot . Couldn'tmiss ' em . It was a bloody crime . " He drank down the champagne and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his arms crushing her . She was dizzy . She walked up and down the room trying to catch her breath . " Goodnight , hot sketch , " Si said and carefully put on his coat and vest again and was gone out the door . She was dizzy . Sam was back and was showing her a lot of calculations on a piece of paper . His eyes bulged shiny into her face as she tried to read . His hands were shaking . " It 's tonight , " he kept saying , " it 's tonight that our lifelines cross . . . . We are married whether we wish it or not . I do n't believe in freewill . Do you , darling Margo ? " Margo was dizzy . She could n't say anything . " Come , dear child , you are tired . " Margolies ' voice burred soothingly in her ears . She let him lead her into the bedroom and carefully take her clothes off and lay her between the black silk sheets of the big poster bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . The detective outside touched his hat as they turned into the drive . It made her feel good to see the man 's big pugface as he stood there guarding her house . Agnes was up and walking up and down in a padded flowered dressinggown in the livingroom with a newspaper in her hand . " Where have you been ? " she cried . " Oh , Margie , you 'll ruin your looks if you go on like this and you 're just getting a start too . . . . Look at this ... now do n't be shocked . . . remember it 's all for the best . " She handed the Times to Margo , pointing out a headline with the sharp pink manicured nail of her forefinger . " Did n't I tell you Frank was watching over us ?

Near them was found the body of a young man whose skull had been fractured by a blow from a blunt instrument who was identified as a Cuban , Antonio Garrido , erstwhile extra on several prominent studio lots . He was still breathing when the police broke in in response to telephoned complaints from the neighbors . The fourth member of the party , a German citizen named Max Hirsch , supposed by some to be an Austrian nobleman , who shared an apartment at Mimosa in a fashionable bungalowcourt with the handsome young Cuban , had fled before police reached the scene of the tragedy . At an early hour this morning he had not yet been located by the police . Margo felt the room swinging in great circles around her head . " Oh , my God , " she said . Going upstairs she had to hold tight to the baluster to keep from falling . She tore off her clothes and ran herself a hot bath and lay back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " wailed Agnes from the other room , " your lovely new gown is a wreck . " Margo and Sam Margolies flew to Tucson to be married . Nobody was present except Agnes and Rodney Cathcart . After the ceremony Margolies handed the justice of the peace a new hundreddollar bill . The going was pretty bumpy on the way back and the big rattly Ford trimotor gave them quite a shakingup crossing the desert . Margolies ' face was all colors under his white beret but he said it was delightful . Rodney Cathcart and Agnes vomited frankly into their cardboard containers . Margo felt her pretty smile tightening into a desperate grin but she managed to keep the wedding breakfast down . When the plane came to rest at the airport at last , they kept the cameramen waiting a half an hour before they could trust themselves to come down the gangplank flushed and smiling into a rain of streamers andP339confetti thrown by the attendants and the whir of the motionpicture cameras . Rodney Cathcart had to drink most of a pint of scotch before he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore her smile over a mass of yellow orchids that had been waiting for her in the refrigerator at the airport , and Agnes looked tickled to death becauseSam had bought her orchids too , lavender ones , and insisted that she stride down the gangplank into the cameras with the rest of them . It was a relief after the glare of the desert and the lurching of the plane in the airpockets to get back to the quiet dressingroom at the lot . By three o'clock they were in their makeup . In a small room in the ground floor Margolies went right back to work taking closeups of Margo and Rodney Cathcart in a clinch against the background of a corner of a mud fort . Si was stripped to the waist with two cartridgebelts crossed over his chest and a canvas legionnaire 's kepi on his head and Margo was in a white eveningdress with highheeled satin slippers . They were having trouble with the clinch on account of the cartridgebelts . Margolies with his porcelainhandled cane thrashingin front of him kept strutting back and forth from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glare of the klieg light where Margo and Si clinched and unclinched a dozen times before they hit a position that suited him .

They all love her , a piece of fragile beautiful palpitant womanhood ready to give all for the man she loves .... Margo darling , you faint , you let yourself go in his arms . If his strong arms were n't there to catch you you would fall to the ground .

Before leaving home to make himself a career in an architect 's office ( there was no architecture course at Wisconsin to clutter his mind with stale Beaux Arts drawings ) ; the youngster had seen the dome of the new State Capitol in Madison collapse on account of bad rubblework in the piers , some thieving contractors ' skimping materialsto save the politicians their rakeoff , and perhaps a trifling but deadly error in the architect 's plans ; he never forgot the roar of burst masonry , the flying plaster , the soaring dustcloud , the mashed bodies of the dead and dying being carried out , set faces livid with plasterdust . Walking round downtown Chicago , crossing and recrossing the bridges over the Chicago River in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and loaded wagons and the stamping of big drayhorses and the hooting of towboats with barges and the rumbling whistle of lakesteamers waiting for the draw , he thought of the great continent stretching a thousand miles east and south and north , three thousand miles west , and everywhere , at mineheads , on the shores of newlydredged harbors , along watercourses , at the intersections of railroads , sproutingshacks roundhouses tipples grainelevators stores warehouses tenements , great houses for the wealthy set in broad treeshaded lawns , domed statehouses on hills , hotels churches operahouses auditoriums .

Wright 's father was a preacher too , a restless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Weymouth , Massachusetts , and then as a Unitarian in the middleP 343west , taught music , read Sanskrit and finally walked out on his family . Young Wright was born on his grandfather 's farm , went to school in Weymouth and Madison , worked summers on a farm of his uncle 's in Wisconsin . His training in architecture was the reading of Viollet le Duc , the apostle of the thirteenth century and of the pure structural mathematicsof gothic stonemasonry , and the seven years he worked with Louis Sullivan in the office of Adler and Sullivan in Chicago . ( It wasLouis Sullivan who , after Richardson , invented whatever was invented in nineteenthcentury architecture in America . ) When Frank Lloyd Wright left Sullivan he had already launched a distinctive style , prairie architecture . In Oak Park he built broad suburban dwellings for rich men that were the first buildings to break the hold on American builders ' minds of centuries of pastward routine , of the wornout capital and plinth and pediment dragged through the centuries from the Acropolis , and the jaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Frank Lloyd Wright was cutting out a new avenue that led towards the swift constructions in glassbricks and steelforeshadowed today . Delightedly he reached out for the new materials , steel in tension , glass , concrete , the million new metals and alloys . The son and grandson of preachers , he became a preacher in blueprints , projecting constructions in the American future instead of the European past . Inventor of plans , plotter of tomorrow 's girderwork phrases , he preaches to the young men coming of age in the time of oppression , cooped up by the plasterboard partitions of finance routine , their lives and plans made poor by feudal levies of parasite money standing astride every process to shake down progress for the cutting of coupons : The properly citified citizen has become a broker , dealing chiefly in human frailties or the ideas and inventions of others , a puller of levers , a presser of buttons of vicarious power , his by way of machine craft . . . andP 344over beside him and beneath him , even in his heart as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form to goad this anxious consumer 's unceasingstruggle for or against more or less merciful or merciless money increment . To the young men who spend their days and nights drafting the plans for new rented aggregates of rented cells upended on hard pave-ments , he preachesthe horizons of his boyhood , a future that is not the rise of a few points in a hundred selected stocks , or an increase in carloadings , or a multiplication of credit in the bank or a rise in the rate on callmoney , but a new clean construction , from the ground up , based on uses and needs , towards the American future instead of towards the painsmearedpast of Europe and Asia . Usonia he calls the broad teeming band of this new nation across the enormous continent between Atlantic and Pacific . He preaches a project for Usonia : It is easy to realize how the complexity of crude utilitarian constructionin the mechanical infancy of our growth , like the crude scaffoldingfor some noble building , did violence to the landscape . . . . The crude purpose of pioneering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the true work , the culture of a civilization , may appear . Like the life of many a preacher , prophet , exhorter , Frank Lloyd Wright 's life has been stormy . He has raised children , had rows with wives , overstepped boundaries , got into difficulties with the law , divorcecourts , bankruptcy , always the yellow press yapping at his heels , his misfortunes yelled out in headlines in the evening papers : affairs with women , the nightmare horror of the burning of his house in Wisconsin . By a curious ironythe building that is most completely his is the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo that was one of the few structures to come unharmed through the earthquake of 1923 ( the day the cable came telling him that the building had stood saving so many hundreds of lives he writes was one of his happiest days ) P 345and it was reading in German that most Americans first learned of his work . His life has been full of arrogant projects unaccomplished . ( How often does the preacher hear his voice echo back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust fuzz over the carefullycontrivedplans , the architect see the rolledup blueprints curl yellowingand brittle in the filingcabinet . ) Twice he 's rebuilt the house where he works in his grandfather 's valley in Wisconsin after fires and disasters that would have smashed most men forever . He works in Wisconsin , an erect spare whitehaired man , his sons are architects , apprenticesfrom all over the world come to work with him , drafting the new city ( he calls it Broadacre City ) . Near and Far are beaten ( to imagine the new city you must blot out every ingrained habit of the past , build a nation from the ground up with the new tools ) . For the architect there are only uses : the incredible multiplication of functions , strength and tension in metal , the dynamo , the electric coil , radio , the photoelectric cell , the internalcombustion motor , glassconcrete ; and needs . ( Tell us , doctors of philosophy , what are the needs of a man . At least a man needs to be notjailed notafraid nothungry notcold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has never seenthat cares nothing for the uses and needs of a man or a woman or a child . ) Building a building is building the lives of the workers and dwellers in the building . The buildings determine civilization as the cells in the honeycombthe functions of bees . Perhaps in spite of himself the arrogant draftsman , the dilettantein concrete , the bohemian artist for wealthy ladies desiring to pay for prominence with the startling elaboration of their homes has been forced by the logic of uses and needs , by the lifelong struggle against the dragging undertow of money in mortmain , to draft plans that demand for their fulfillment a new life ; P 346only in freedom can we build the Usonian city . His plans are coming to life . His blueprints , as once Walt Whitman 's words , stir the young men :  --  Frank Lloyd Wright , patriarch of the new building , not without honor except in his own country .

Smythe according to the petition was employed testing the viscosityof lubricating oil in the Okmulgee plant of the company on July 12 , 1924 . One of his duties was to pour benzol on a hot vat where it was boiled down so that the residue could be examined . Day after day he breathed the not unpleasant fumes from the vat . One morning about a year later Smythe cut his face while shavingand noticed that the blood flowed for hours in copious quantitiesP 352from the tiny wound . His teeth also began to bleed when he brushed them and when the flow failed to stop after several days he consulted a doctor . The diagnosis was that the benzol fumes had broken down the walls of his blood vessels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only under the effect of opiates , Smythe 's spleen and tonsils were removed . Meanwhile the periodic blood transfusions were resorted to in an effortto keep his blood supply near normal . In all more than thirty-six pints of blood were infused through his arms until when the veins had been destroyed it was necessary to cut into his body to open other veins . During the whole time up to eight hours before his death , the complaint recited , he was conscious and in pain . Mary FrenchThe first job Mary French got in New York she got through one of Ada 's friends . It was sitting all day in an artgallery on Eighth Street where there was an exposition of sculpture and answering the questions of ladies in flowing batiks who came in in the afternoons to be seen appreciating art . After two weeks of that the girl she was replacingcame back and Mary who kept telling herself she wanted to be connected with something real went and got herself a job in the ladies ' and misses ' clothing department at Bloomingdale 's . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went home and wrote an article about departmentstore workers for the Freeman and on the strength of it got herself a job doing research on wages , livingcosts and the spread between wholesale and retail prices in the dress industryfor the International Ladies ' Garment Workers . She liked the long hours digging out statistics , the talk with the organizers , the wisecrackingradicals , the working men and girls who came into the crowded dingy office she shared with two or three other research workers . At last she felt what she was doing was real . Ada had gone to Michigan with her family and had left Mary in the apartment on Madison Avenue . Mary was relieved to have her gone ; she was still fond of her but their interests were so different and they had silly arguments about the relative importance of art and socialP353justice that left them tired and cross at each other so that sometimes they would n't speak for several days ; and then they hated each other 's friends . Still Mary could n't help being fond of Ada . They were such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikers ' defense committees , legalaid funds and everything that Mary suggested ; she was a very openhanded girl , but her point of view was hopelessly rich , she had no social consciousness . The apartment got on Mary French 's nerves , too , with its pastelcolored nicknacks and the real Whistler and the toothick rugs and the toosoft boxsprings on the bed and the horridlittle satin tassels on everything ; but Mary was making so little money that not paying rent was a great help . Ada 's apartment came in very handy the night of the big meeting in Madison Square Garden to welcome the classwar prisoners releasedfrom Atlanta . Mary French who had been asked to sit on the platform overheard some members of the committee saying that they had no place to put up Ben Compton . They were looking for a quiet hideout where he could have a rest and shake the D.J . operatives who 'd been following him around everywhere since he 'd gotten to New York . Mary went up to them and in a whisper suggested her place . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner of Twentyninth and Madison until a tall pale man with a checked cap pulled way down over his face got in and sat down shakily beside her . When the cab started he put his steelrimmed glasses back on . " Look back and see if a grey sedan 's following us , " he said . " I do n't see anything , " said Mary . " Oh , you would n't know it if you saw it , " he grumbled . To be on the safe side they left the cab at the Grand Central station and walked without speaking a way up Park Avenue and then west on a cross street and down Madison again . Mary plucked his sleeve to stop him in front of the door . Once in the apartment he made Mary shoot the bolt and let himself drop into a chair without taking off his cap or his overcoat . He did n't say anything . His shoulders were shaking . Mary did n't like to stare at him . She did n't know what to do . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cigarette and then she went into the kitchenette to make coffee . When she got back he 'd taken off his things and was warming his bigknuckled hands at the gaslogs . " You must excuse me , comrade , " he said in a dry hoarse voice . " I 'm all in . " P 354 " Oh , do n't mind me , " said Mary . " I thought you might want some coffee . " " No coffee . . . hot milk , " he said hurriedly . His teeth were chatteringas if he were cold . She came back with a cup of hot milk . " Could I have some sugar in it ? " he said and almost smiled . " Of course , " she said . " You made a magnificent speech , so restrainedand kind of fiery . . . . It was the best in the whole meeting . " " You did n't think I seemed agitated ? I was afraid I 'd go to pieces and not be able to finish .... You 're sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're sure we were n't followed ? " " I 'm sure nobody 'll find you here on Madison Avenue . . . . It 's the last place they 'd look . " " I know they are trailing me , " he said with a shudder and dropped into a chair again . They were silent for a long time . Mary could hear the gaslogs and the little sucking sips he drank the hot milk with . Then she said : " It must have been terrible . " He got to his feet and shook his head as if he did n't want to talk about it . He was a young man lankilybuilt , but he walked up and down in front of the gaslogs with a strangely elderly dragging walk . His face was white as a mushroom with sags of brownish skin under the eyes . " You see , " he said , " it 's like people who 've been sick and have to learn to walk all over again . . . do n't pay any attention . " He drank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . She went into the other bedroom and closed the door and lay down on the bed with a pile of books and pamphlets . She had some legal detailsto look up . She had just gotten sleepy and crawled under the covers herself when a knocking woke her . She snatched at her bathrobe and jumped up and opened the door . Ben Compton stood there trembling wearing a long unionsuit . He 'd taken off his glasses and they 'd left a red band across the bridge of his nose . His hair was rumpled and his knobby feet were bare . " Comrade , " he stammered , " d' you mind if I ... d' you mind if I . . . d' you mind if I lie on the bed beside you ? I ca n't sleep . I ca n't stay alone . " " You poor boy . . . . Get into bed , you are shivering , " she said . She lay down beside him still wearing her bathrobeand slippers . " Shall I put out the light ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He shook his head . She pulled the covers up under his chin as ifP355he were a child . He lay there on his back staring with wideopen black eyes at the ceiling . His teeth were clenched . She put her hand on his forehead as she would on a child 's to see if he was feverish . He shudderedand drew away . " Do n't touch me , " he said . Mary put out the light and tried to compose herself to sleep on the bed beside him . After a while he grabbed her hand and held it tight . They lay there in the dark side by side staring up at the ceiling . Then she felt his grip on her hand loosen ; he was dropping off to sleep . She lay there beside him with her eyes open . She was afraid the slighteststir might wake him . Every time she fell asleep she dreamed that detectives were breaking in the door and woke up with a shudderingstart . Next morning when she went out to go to the office he was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note explaining that there was food and coffee in the icebox . When she got home that afternoon her heart beat fast as she went up the elevator . Her first thought after she 'd opened the door was that he 'd gone . The bedroom was empty . Then she noticed that the bathroom door was closed and that a sound of humming came from there . She tapped . " That you , Comrade Compton ? " she said . " Be right out . " His voice sounded firmer , more like the deep rich voice he 'd addressed the meeting in . He came out smiling , long pale legs bristling with black hairs sticking oddly out from under Mary 's lavender bathrobe . " Hello , I 've been taking a hot bath . This is the third I 've taken . Doctor said they were a good thing . . . . You know , relax . . . . " He pulled out a pinkleather edition of Oscar Wilde 's Dorian Gray from under his arm and shook it in front of her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . . . . Say , comrade , whose apartment is this anyway ? " " A friend of mine who 's a violinist . . . . She 's away till fall . " " I wish she was here to play for us . I 'd love to hear some good music ... . Maybe you 're musical . " Mary shook her head . " Could you eat some supper ? I 've brought some in . " " I 'll try . . . nothing too rich ... I 've gotten very dyspeptic . . . . So you thought I spoke all right ? " " I thought it was wonderful , " she said . " After supper I 'll look at the papers you brought in .... If the kept press only would n't always garble what we say . " She heated some peasoup and made toast and bacon and eggs and he ate up everything she gave him . While they were eating they had aP356nice cozy talk about the movement . She told him about her experiencesin the great steelstrike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in her . They 'd hardly finished eating before he began to turn white . He went to the bathroom and threw up . " Ben , you poor kid , " she said when he came back looking haggard and shaky . " It 's awful . " " Funny , " he said in a weak voice . " When I was in the Bergen County jail over there in Jersey I came out feeling fine . . . but this time it 's hit me . " " Did they treat you badly ? " His teeth clenched and the muscles of his jaw stiffened , but he shook his head . Suddenly he grabbed her hand and his eyes filled with tears . " Mary French , you 're being too good to me , " he said . Mary could n't help throwing her arms around him and hugging him . " You do n't know what it means to find a . . . to find a sweet girl comrade , " he said , pushing her gently away . " Now let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " After Ben had been hiding out in the apartment for about a week the two of them decided one Saturday night that they loved each other . Mary was happier than she 'd ever been in her life . They romped around like kids all Sunday and went out walking in the park to hear the band play in the evening . They threw sponges at each other in the bathroom and teased each other while they were getting undressed ; they slept tightly clasped in each other 's arms . In spite of never going out except at night , in the next few days Ben 's cheeks began to have a little color in them and his step began to get some spring into it . " You 've made me feel like a man again , Mary , " he 'd tell her a dozen times a day . " Now I 'm beginning to feel like I could do something again . After all the revolutionary labor movement'sjust beginning in this country . The tide 's going to turn , you watch . It 's begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was something moving to Mary in the way he pronounced those three words : Lenin , Trotzky , Russia . After a couple of weeks he began to go to conferences with radical leaders . She never knew if she 'd find him in or not when she got home from work . Sometimes it was three or four in the morning before he came in tired and haggard . Always his pockets bulged with literature and leaflets . Ada 's fancy livingroom gradually filled up with badlyprinted newspapers and pamphlets and mimeographed sheets . On the mantelpiece among Ada 's dresdenchina figures playing musicalinstruments were stacked the three volumes of Capital with placesP357marked in them with pencils . In the evening he 'd read Mary pieces of a pamphlet he was working on , modeled on Lenin 's What 's to Be Done ? and ask her with knitted brows if he was clear , if simple workerswould understand what he meant . One Sunday in August he made her go with him to Coney Island where he 'd made an appointment to meet his folks ; he 'd figured it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did n't want the dicks to trail him home and then be bothering the old people or his sister who had a good job as secretary to a prominent businessman . When they met it was some time before the Comptons noticed Mary at all . They sat at a big round table at Stauch 's and drank nearbeer . Mary found it hard to sit still in her chair when the Comptons all turned their eyes on her at once . The old people were very polite with gentle manners but she could see that they wished she had n't come . Ben 's sister Gladys gave her one hard mean stare and then paid no attention to her . Ben 's brother Sam , a stout prosperouslooking Jew who Ben had said had a small business , a sweatshop probably , was polite and oily . Only Izzy , the youngest brother , looked anything like a workingman and he was more likely a gangster . He treated her with kidding familiarity , she could see he thought of her as Ben 's moll . They all admired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , the scholar , but they felt sorry about his radicalism as if it was an unfortunatesickness he had contracted . Still his name in the paper , the applause in Madison Square Garden , the speeches calling him a workingclass hero had impressed them . After Ben and Mary had left the Comptons and were going into the subwaystation , Ben said bitterlyin her ear , " Well , that 's the Jewish family . . . . What do you think of it ? Some straitjacket . . . . It'ud be the same if I killed a man or ran a string of whorehouses . . . even in the movement you ca n't break away from them . " " But , Ben , it 's got its good side ... they 'd do anything in the world for you . . . my mother and me we really hate each other . " Ben needed clothes and so did Mary ; she never had any of the money from the job left over from week to week , so for the first time in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her mother sent back a check with a rather nice letter saying that she 'd been made Republican State Committeewoman and that she admired Mary 's independence because she 'd always believed women had just as much right as men to earn their own living and maybe women in politics would have a better influence than she 'd once thought , andP 358certainly Mary was showing grit in carving out a career for herself , but she did hope she 'd soon come around to seeing that she could have just as interesting a career if she 'd come back to Colorado Springs and occupy the social position her mother 's situation entitled her to . Ben was so delighted when he saw the check he did n't ask what Mary had got the money for . " Five hundred bucks is just what 1 needed , " he said . " I had n't wanted to tell you but they want me to lead a strike over in Bayonne . . . rayonworkers . . . you know , the old munitionplants made over to make artificial silk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers are so poor they ca n't pay their union dues . . . but they 've got a fine radical union over there . It 's important to get a footholdin the new industries . . . that 's where the old sellout organizationsof the A.F. of L. are failing .... Five hundred bucks 'll take care of the printing bill . " " Oh , Ben , you are not rested yet . I 'm so afraid they 'll arrest you again . " He kissed her . " Nothing to worry about . " " But , Ben , I wanted you to get some clothes . " " This is a fine suit . ' What 's the matter with this suit ? Did n't Uncle Sam give me this suit himself ? . . . Once we get things going we 'll get you over to do publicity for us . . . enlarge your knowledge of the clothing industry . Oh , Mary , you 're a wonderful girl to have raised that money . " That fall when Ada came back , Mary moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Fourth Street in the Village , so that Ben could have some place to go when he came over to New York . That winter she worked tremendously hard , still handling her old job and at the same time doing publicity for the strikes Ben led in several Jersey towns . " That 's nothing to how hard we 'll have to work when we have soviets in America , " Ben would say when she 'd ask him did n't he think they 'd do better work if they did n't always try to do so many things at once . She never knew when Ben was going to turn up . Sometimes he 'd be there every night for a week and sometimes he would be away for a month and she 'd only hear from him through newsreleases about meetings , picketlines broken up , injunctions fought in the courts . Once they decided they 'd get married and have a baby , but the comradeswere calling for Ben to come and organize the towns aroundP 359Passaic and he said it would distract him from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be plenty of time for that sort of thing afterthe revolution . Now was the time to fight . Of course she could have the baby if she wanted to but it would spoil her usefulness in the struggle for several months and he did n't think this was the time for it . It was the first time they 'd quarreled . She said he was heartless . He said they had to sacrifice their personal feelings for the workingclass , and stormed out of the house in a temper . In the end she had an abortion but she had to write her mother again for money to pay for it . She threw herself into her work for the strikecommittee harder than ever . Sometimes for weeks she only slept four or five hours a night . She took to smoking a great deal . There was always a cigarette resting on a corner of her typewriter . The fine ash dropped into the pages as they came from the multigraph machine . Whenever she could be spared from the office she went around collecting money from wealthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the picketline , coaxing articles out of newspapermen , traveling around the country to find charitable people to go on bailbonds . The strikers , the men and women and children on picketlines , in soupkitchens , being interviewed in the dreary front parlors of their homes stripped of furniture they had n't been able to make the last payment on , the buses full of scabs , the cops and deputies with sawedoff shotguns guarding the tall palings of the silent **25;3484;TOOLONG of the blackwindowed millbuildings , passed in a sort of dreamy haze before her , like a show on the stage , in the middle of the continuous typing and multigraphing , the writing of letters and working up of petitions , the long grind of officework that took up her days and nights . She and Ben had no life together at all any more . She thrilled to him the way the workers did at meetings when he 'd come to the platformin a tumult of stamping and applause and talk to them with flushed cheeks and shining eyes talking clearly directly to each man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economicsetup to them . The millgirls were all crazy about him . In spite of herself Mary French would get a sick feeling in the pit of her stomachat the way they looked at him and at the way some big buxom freshlooking woman would stop him sometimes in the hall outsideP360the office and put her hand on his arm and make him pay attention to her . Mary working away at her desk with her tongue bitter and her mouth dry from too much smoking would look at her yellowstained fingers and push her untidy uncurled hair off her forehead and feel badlydressed and faded and unattractive . If he 'd give her one smile just for her before he bawled her out before the whole office because the leaflets were n't ready , she 'd feel happy all day . But mostly he seemed to have forgotten that they 'd ever been lovers . After the A.F. of L. officials from Washington in expensive overcoatsand silk mufflers who smoked twentyfivecent cigars and spat on the floor of the office had taken the strike out of Ben 's hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fourth Street late one night just as Mary was going to bed . His eyes were redrimmed from lack of sleep and his cheeks were sunken and grey . " Oh , Ben , " she said and burst out crying . He was cold and bitter and desperate . He sat for hours on the edge of her bed telling her in a sharp monotonous voice about the sellout and the wrangles between the leftwingers and the oldline socialists and laborleaders , and how now that it was all over here was his trial for contempt of court coming up . " I feel so bad about spending the workers ' money on my defense . . . . I 'd as soon go to jail as not . . . but it 's the precedent . . . . We 've got to fight every case and it 's the one way we can use the liberal lawyers , the lousy fakers .... And it costs so much and the union 's broke and I do n't like to have them spend the money on me . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cases against the other boys will all be dropped .... " " The thing to do , " she said , smoothing his hair off his forehead , " is to relax a little . " " You should be telling me ? " he said and started to unlacehis shoes . It was a long time before she could get him to get into bed . He sat there halfundressed in the dark shivering and talking about the errorsthat had been committed in the strike . When at last he 'd taken his clothes off and stood up to lay them on a chair he looked like a skeleton in the broad swath of grey glare that cut across the room from the streetlight outside her window . She burst out crying all over again at the sunken look of his chest and the deep hollows inside his collarbone . " What 's the matter , girl ? " Ben said gruffly . " You crying because you have n't got a Valentino to go to bed with you ? " " Nonsense , Ben , I was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 361kid , you work so hard . " " You 'll be going off with a goodlooking young bondsalesman one of these days , like you were used to back in ColoradoSprings . . . . I know what to expect ... I do n't give a damn . . . I can make the fight alone . " " Oh , Ben , do n't talk like that ... you know I 'm heart and soul . . . " She drew him to her . Suddenly he kissed her . Next morning they quarreled bitterly while they were dressing , about the value of her researchwork . She said that after all he could n't talk ; the strike had n't been such a wild success . He went out without eating his breakfast . She went uptown in a clenched fury of misery , threw up her job and a few days later went down to Boston to work on the Sacco-Vanzetti case with the new committee that had just been formed . She 'd never been in Boston before . The town these sunny winter days had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got herself a little room on the edge of the slums back of Beacon Hill and decided that when the case was won , she 'd write a novel about Boston . She bought some school copybooks in a little musty stationers ' shop and started right away taking notes for the novel . The smell of the new copybook with its faint blue lines made her feel fresh and new . After this she 'd observe life . She 'd never fall for a man again . Her mother had sent her a check for Christmas . With that she bought herselfsome new clothes and quite a becoming hat . She started to curl her hair again . Her job was keeping in touch with newspapermen and trying to get favorable items into the press . It was uphill work . Although most of the newspapermen who had any connection with the case thought the two had been wrongly convicted they tended to say that they were just two wop anarchists , so what the hell ? After she 'd been out to Dedham jail to talk to Sacco and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell the U.P . man what she felt about them one Saturday night when he was taking her out to dinner at an Italian restaurant on Hanover Street . He was the only one of the newspapermen she got really friendly with . He was an awful drunk but he 'd seen a great deal and he had a gentle detached manner that she liked . He liked her for some reason , though he kidded her unmercifully about what he called her youthful fanaticism . When he 'd ask her out to dinner and make her drink a lot of red wine she 'd tell herself that it was n't really a waste of time , that itP 362was important for her to keep in touch with the press services . His name was Jerry Burnham . " But , Jerry , how can you stand it ? If the State of Massachusetts can kill those two innocent men in the face of the protest of the whole world it 'll mean that there never will be any justice in America ever again . " " When was there any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giggle , leaning over to fill up her glass . " Ever heard of Tom Mooney ? " The curly white of his hair gave a strangely youthful look to his puffy red face . " But there 's something so peaceful , so honest about their ; you get such a feeling of greatness out of them . Honestly they are great men . " " Everything you say makes it more remarkable that they were n't executed years ago . " " But the working people , the common people , they wo n't allow it . " " It 's the common people who get most fun out of the torture and execution of great men . . . . If it 's not going too far back I 'd like to know who it was demanded the execution of our friend Jesus H. Christ ? " It was Jerry Burnham who taught her to drink . He lived himself in a daily alcoholic haze carrying his drinks carefully and circumspectly like an acrobat walking across a tight wire with a tableful of dishes balanced on his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he attended to his wires and the business of his of fice as casually as he 'd pay the check in one speakeasy before walking around the corner to another . His kidneys were shot and he was on the winewagon he said , but she often noticed whiskey on his breath when she went into his office . He was so exasperating that she 'd swear to herself each time she went out with him it was the last . No more wasting time when every minute was precious . But the next time he 'd ask her out she 'd crumple up at once and smile and say yes and waste another evening drinking wine and listening to him ramble on . " It 'll all end in blindness and sudden death , " he said one night as he left her in a taxi at the corner of her street . " But who cares ? Who in hell cares . . . ? Who on the bloody louseinfested globe gives one little small microscopic vestigial hoot ? " As courtdecision after courtdecision was lost and the rancid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported adversely and no hope remained but a pardon from the governor himself , Mary worked more and more desperately hard . She wrote articles , she talked to politicians and ministers and arguediP363with editors , she made speeches in unionhalls . She wrote her mother pitiful humiliating letters to get money out of her on all sorts of pretexts . Every cent she could scrape up went into the work of her committee . There were always stationery and stamps and telegrams and phonecalls to pay for . She spent long evenings trying to coax communists , socialists , anarchists , liberals into working together . Hurrying along the stonepaved streets she 'd be whispering to herself , " They 've got to be saved , they 've got to be saved . " When at last she got to bed her dreams were full of impossible tasks ; she was trying to glue a broken teapot together and as soon as she got one side of it mended the other side would come to pieces again , she was trying to mend a rent in her skirt and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undone again ; she was trying to put together pieces of a torn typewritten sheet , the telegram was of the greatest importance , she could n't see , it was all a blur before her eyes ; it was the evidence that would force a new trial , her eyes were too bad , when she had spelled out one word from the swollen throbbing letters she 'd forgotten the last one ; she was climbing a shaky hillside among black guttedlooking houses pitching at crazy angles where steelworkers lived , at each step she slid back , it was too steep , she was crying for help , yelling , sliding back . Then warm reassuring voices like Ben Compton 's when he was feeling well were telling her that Public Opinion would n't allow it that after all Americans had a sense of Justice and Fair Play that the Workingclass would rise ; she 'd see crowded meetings , slogans , banners , glary billboards with letters pitching into perspective saying : Workers of the World Unite , she 'd be marching in the middle of crowds in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd wake up with a start , bathe and dress hurriedly and rush down to the office of the committee snatching up a glass of orangejuiceand a cup of coffee on the way . She was always the first there ; if she slackened her work for a moment she 'd see their faces , the **25;3511;TOOLONG pale face with the flashing eyes and the fishpeddler 's philosophical mustaches and his musing unscared eyes . She 'd see behind them the electric chair as clear as if it were standing in front of her desk in the stuffy crowded office . July went by all too fast . August came . A growing crowd of all sorts of people began pouring through the office : old friends , wobblies who 'd hitchhiked from the coast , politicians interested in the ItalianP364vote , lawyers with suggestions for the defense , writers , outofwork newspapermen , cranks and phonies of all kinds attracted by rumors of an enormous defensefund . She came back one afternoon from speaking in a unionhall in Pawtucket and found G. H. Barrow sitting at her desk . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministers laborleaders demanding that they join in the protest in the name of justice and civilization and the workingclass , long telegrams and cables at top rates . She figured out the cost as she checked them off . She did n't know how the committee could pay for them , but she handed them to the messengerboy waiting outside . She could hardly believe that those words had made her veins tingle only a few weeks before . It shocked her to think how meaninglessthey seemed to her now like the little cards you get from a one-cent fortunetelling machine . For six months now she 'd been reading and writing the same words every day . Mary did n't have time to be embarrassed meeting George Barrow . They went out together to get a plate of soup at a cafeteria talking about nothing but the case as if they 'd never known each other before . Picketing the State House had begun again and as they came out of the restaurant Mary turned to him and said , " Well , George , how about going up and getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the afternoon papers . Your name would give us back the front page . " He flushed red , and stood there in front of the restaurant in the noontime crowd looking tall and nervous and popeyed in his natty lightgrey suit . " But , my dear g-g-girl , I . . . if I thought it would do the slightest good I would . . . I 'd get myself arrested or run over by a truck . . . but I think it would rob me of whatever usefulness I might have . " Mary French looked him straight in the eye , her face white with fury . " I did n't think you 'd take the risk , " she said , clipping each word off and spitting it in his face . She turned her back on him and hurried to the office . It was a sort of relief when she was arrested herself . She 'd planned to keep out of sight of the cops as she had been told her work was too valuable to lose , but she 'd had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a new batch of picketers who had gone off without them . There was nobody in the office she could send . She was just crossing Beacon Street when two large polite cops suddenly appeared , one on eachP 365side of her . One of them said , " Sorry , miss , please come quietly , " and she found herself sitting in the dark patrolwagon . Driving to the policestation she had a soothing sense of helplessness and irresponsibility . It was the first time in weeks she had felt herself relax . At the Joy Street station they booked her but they did n't put her in a cell . She sat on a bench opposite the window with two Jewish garmentworkers and a welldressed woman in a flowered summer dress with a string of pearls round her neck and watched the men picketers pouring through into the cells . The cops were polite , everybody was jolly ; it seemed like a kind of game , it was hard to believe anything real was at stake . In a crowd that had just been unloaded from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught sight of a tall man she recognized as Donald Stevens from his picture in the Daily . A redfaced cop held on to each of his arms . His shirt was torn open at the neck and his necktie had a stringy look as if somebody had been yanking on it . The first thing Mary thought was how handsomely he held himself . He had steelgrey hair and a brown outdoorlooking skin and luminous grey eyes over high cheekbones . When he was led away from the desk she followed his broad shoulders with her eyes into the gloom of the cells . The woman next to her whispered in an awed voice that he was being held for inciting to riot instead of sauntering and loitering like the rest . Five thousand dollars bail . He had tried to hold a meeting on Boston Common . Mary had been there about a halfhour when little Mr. Feinstein from the office came round with a tall fashionablydressed man in a linen suit who put up the bail for her . At the same time Donald Stevens was bailed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the policestation together . At the corner the man in the linen suit said , " You two were too useful to leave in there all day . . . . Perhaps we 'll see you at the Bellevue ... suite D , second floor . " Then he waved his hand and left them . Mary was so anxious to talk to Donald Stevens she did n't think to ask the man 's name . Events were going past her faster than she could focus her mind on them . Mary plucked at Donald Stevens ' sleeve , she and Mr. Feinstein both had to hurry to keep up with his long stride . " I 'm Mary French , " she said . " What can we do ? . . . We 've got to do something . " He turned to her with a broad smile as if he 'd seen her for the first time . " I 've
