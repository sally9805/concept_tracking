txt Colonel H. Norman Schwarzkopf , head of the New Jersey police searching for the kidnapped Lindbergh baby , denied yesterday that he knew anything about the activities of underworld emissaries of Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh and admitted that the men of his command had made no new progress toward finding the missing infant . It is almost two weeks since Charles Augustus Jr . was stolen from the country home of his parents on Sourland Mountain , near Hopewell , N. J. , but thus far the nation-wide search for the kidnappers has produced nothing but cold trails , suspects and fantastic rumors that have been investigated and eliminated . The confessed inability of the police to make appreciable headway has convinced friends and advisers of the Lindberghs that their best , if not only , hope of getting back their baby lies in private negotiations with the kidnappers . Thus far , however , Salvy Spitale , Irving Bitz and Morris Rosner , their undercover agents , have produced nothing more tangible than expressions of hopefulness . Ships and Homes Searched on Tips . During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aboard a ship and that it was in houses in Baltimore , in Lexington , Ky. , and in Jamaica , Queens . The net result of these efforts to find the child was to leave the police just where they were on the day after the crime was discovered . They also checked up on reports that the kidnapping was executed by members of the " Purple Gang " of Detroit , a group of Denver gangsters who had shifted the scene of their operations to New York and New Jersey . and wound up by deciding that they had been following blind leads . Clifford Snook , Chief of Police of the Township of Hopewell , revealed that he had been conducting an investigation independently of the state police since the day news of the crime electrified the countryside and spoke disparagingly of the activities of outsiders on the case . He holds the opinion that the kidnappers were helped by some of the natives of the Sourland country and believes a thorough search of the woods should have been made without delay . Asserting that the state police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them stepped half a mile off the road he 'd be lost , " Snook declared that the troopers were " working in the dark and just following clues that are brought to them . " Insists Coat Is a Clue . Snook said he was working on a " clue " of his own . Although all other officials denied it , the local police chief said he knew that a heavy coat like a lumberman 's jacket had been found soon after the kidnapping in a clump of bushes where the kidnappers ' trail was lost . Police Chief Robert Warren of Pennington , credited with being the original source of the story of the coat , refused to affirm or deny that he knew of the garment 's existence , but Colonel Schwarzkopf said flatly that no such discovery had been made . Colonel Schwarzkopf 's denial that the police and underworld had joined hands to recover the missing baby was contained in one of his official communiques , which said : " While we have been credited through the press with appealing to the underworld for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the underworld and the police officials in charge of the investigation . Therefore , if any information of importance has been obtained from the underworld with reference to this investigation , it has never been made known to this department . " The only positive information contained in any of the bulletins issued during the day was in the grie issued at 10 o'clock last night when Colonel Schwarzkopf revealed that police had succeeded in locating Frank Berg , who was said to have been involved in the attempted kidnapping of Max Phillips , retired collar manufacturer of Eatontown , several years ago . He is to be questioned today , Colonel Schwarzkopf said . The discouraging failure of the police to make important progress in the investigation was indicated clearly in the official bulletins issued in the forenoon and afternoon . In the morning the teletype carried this bulletin from Colonel Schwarz-kopf : " Information was received that a suspicious gang from Denver , Col. , had come East by airplane and were In mysterious activities in II and around New York . This is being investigated and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messAmEs made . " Gang Clue Is Dismissed . In the afternoon this clue was dismissed as follows : " Information on Roma and his associates , whose supposed headquarters were on President Street , Brooklyn , was carefully investigated and the home of Roma on President Street and those of his associates were thoroughly searched for any evidence that would connect them with this crime . Having no further information that would in any way connect them with the crime , we have vindicated them of any connection . " The police official did not give any details of Roma 's identity , but it was recalled that a man of that name had figured in connection with a kidnapping in Denver and that ' three of his alleged henchmen had been arrested in New Jersey some time ago about the time Roma arrived in that State by airplane . The forenoon bulletin regarding the tip that the missing baby was aboard a ship follows : " Information was received last night to the effect that a blond baby resembling the Lindbergh baby was delivered to a stewardess aboard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was due at Hamburg , Germany , March 14 . A radiogram was immediately sent to the captain to investigate these circumstances and report back his findings . " In the afternoon Colonel Schwarzkopf admitted that this tip also had proved worthless . He said : " Word was received about an hour ago from S. S. City of Baltimore , which has docked at Hamburg , Germany , that the baby answering the description of Charles Lindbergh Jr . was a girl baby named Frances Quiback . This message was received from Captain Cross , in command of the City of Baltimore . " Police officials said they had searched baby farms and " all other conceivable places where suspicion directs , " but they admitted that their efforts had " revealed nothing of importance . " While the police teletype carried an urgent request to members of Police Departments around New York to watch for clues that might indicate harm had been done to the child , the New Jersey authorities denied that they had inspired the order .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
