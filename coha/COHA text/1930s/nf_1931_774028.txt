From the eighth to the tenth centuries the Viking ships were larger , the re-mains of one found in the Orkneys and ascribed to the ninth century being as much as 130 feet in length and about r5 feet in the depth of its hold . This vessel was probably unusually large for the time . On the Mediterranean changes in vessel construction , espe cially that of war vessels , were being effected . The warships of the Eastern or Byzantine Empire of the ninth and tenth centuries were showing some tendency toward the galley-form or " single banked ship , " of great speed . With the development of commerce the galley , ' or oar-propelled ves sel , tended to give way to the sailing vessel ; but the former maintained its place in the Mediterranean as a ship of war during the greater part of the medieval period . During the Crusades merchant vessels were usually sailing vessels but often armed for protection .

Medieval vessels were on the whole more seaworthy and probably better formed for the attainment of speed . Reliance upon sails and the substitution of the rudder for steering pad dles were forward steps in the progress of shipbuilding and ship operations , but not particularly novel . Neither can it be said that the average size of medieval seagoing vessels was at all impressive . From the fifth to the fifteenth centuries , A.D. , there was an appreciable increase in the capacity of the water carrier ; but the largest vessels of the fifteenth century probably did not exceed those of the WATER CRAFT , CLASSIFICATION 6i Romans in the second and third centuries of our era ? if indeed they were as large . Modern sailing vessels . Modern sailing vessels have ex-hibited several improvements in form of hulls , number and height of masts , adjustments of sails , use of chain pumps , the weighing of anchors by means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the nineteenth century they began to be built of iron and steel . This change , how-ever , occurred at a time when the steamer was fast displac-ing the sailing vessel as the typical ocean carrier . In the fifteenth century the " caravel " was being developed and utilized by the Portuguese and the Spanish . This vessel was a sailer of comparatively light build , with three or four masts , partly lateened-rigged and partly square-rigged . ' As in vessels of the medieval period , the poop and forecastle were very high , especially the former . This vessel is note-worthy for its use generally in the great geographical dis-coveries of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries . Two of Columbus ' ships and those in which Vasco da Gama first doubled the Cape of Good Hope were of this type . While a comparatively new type of vessel , the " caravel " ; began to develop during the medieval period and was medi- ( eval in general form . It was employed , especially by the Peninsular countries , during the sixteenth century . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the &design; of the English and other northern ships . The high Spanish poop and forecastle , characteristic of Mediterranean vessels , were abandoned . The sailing ship was assuming its modern form . The commercial rivalries of the Dutch , the English , and the French during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries led to a general increase in size of the ocean carrier . The British ship , Sovereign of the Seas , built in 1637 , was 170 feet long , 48 feet beam , and 19 feet deep . The largest Dutch vessels of the same period were the White Elephant and the Golden Lion , each of which was practically as large 6z OCEAN TRANSPORTATION as its British rival . The French had still larger vessels . During the eighteenth century the English kept on increas ing the size of their ships , but still remained behind the French . The latter people , while continuing to construct bigger vessels , were behind the English and the Dutch in the number of ships operated and in the extent of their overseas commercial enterprises . Before the adoption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had attained a length of over 200 feet and a beam of 55 feet . About the time that steam-power was beginning to be ap plied to ocean transportation a new type of vessel was being developed in the United States which marked a distinct im provement in sailing efficiency . This vessel was the American clipper , which was the most prominent feature of this coun try 's merchant marine during the two decades immediately preceding the Civil War . The American clipper was famous not only for speed but also for economy of operation . By means of increased length in proportion to beam , and with the greatest breadth well aft of the bow , this vessel was able to attain great speed while allowing lighter rigging in proportion to tonnage . The use of the clipper was due largely to the development of various branches of trade in which quick delivery was an important factor for commercial purposes . It was also influenced by the rush of people to the California gold fields after 1.848 . The tea trade between the United States and China called for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tea , spices , coffee and dried fruits , all of which were liable to deterioration during a long voyage . The discovery of gold on the Pacific Coast also put a premium on speed . ' The speed of sailing vessels reached its climax in the clipper . Six miles an hour had been good average speed for long voyages when the clipper first came into use , and a // speed of nine miles was regarded as excellent time , especially for a ship loaded with a full cargo . Clippers often ran an average speed of ten to thirteen miles an hour . On voyages where a vessel had the advantage of trade winds an average of from twelve to fifteen miles an hour for a week or more at a time was not uncommon . The clipper , Red Jacket , made a record sailing from Sandy Hook to Rock Light , Liverpool , in thirteen days and one hour , and the zindrew Jackson in the reverse direction , in fifteen days . After the Civil War there was an increasing diversion of trade ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steamer . The steamer was more dependable , and was rapidly increasing its average rate of speed . The grain trade which flourished during the decade following 1865 attracted the larger sailing vessels . This trade did not require the extreme clipper type of vessel , but the medium-sized ship capable of transporting a large cargo and maintaining a moderate speed . The increasing shipments of heavy freight like lumber and coal were also at this time taken over largely by sailing vessels of this type . Even here , however , the steamer began to cut into the traffic which had been left to the sailing vessels , and before the close of the century it had become evident that even the greater part of the world 's heavy bulk freight would be moved by steampower . Steam-power was revolutionizing water transportation as it had already revolutionized transportation on land , and indeed our whole system of modern production . The present-day sailing vessel and its disadvantages . The sailing vessel still survives and carries an appreciable , but not large , part of the world 's ocean freight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Civil War the construction of square-rigged sailing vessels has been largely abandoned . The typical sailing vessel of today is the schooner , and it is distinctly an American product . Schooners were built as early as 1713 , and were employed in the Atlantic coastwise trade and the trade with the West Indies during the later colonial period . They were afterwards used in the African trade . The early schooners were generally small and had two masts . In 1831 and afterwards , // three- and four-masted vessels were built . It was not , however , until after the Civil War that the schooner became the dominant type of sailing craft . The steamer has proved itself more efficient than the sailer . It has done so because of its greater average speed and its comparative reliability . The motor power of sailing vessels costs nothing , the net cargo capacity is large , and a small crew is required for operation . But against these advantages there are the comparatively slow movement and the uncertainty of the winds , and consequently the time involved in making each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation . Slow average movement means less utilization of the vessel in freight and passenger transportation in proportion to the possible volume of traffic . In other words , a steamer can make two or three voyages during the time a sailing vessel makes one . Uncertainty as to time of voyage obviously limits the usefulness of the sailing vessel for those classes of freight in which the time element is important . DEVELOPMENT OF STEAM AND MOTOR VESSELS STEAM and motor vessels have had a brief history compared with that of the sailing vessel . Within a century , however , they have developed from an experimental means of transportation into the ships of commerce . While their history has been brief , their evolution from both a technical and an economic standpoint has been highly complicated . To discuss with any fullness the principal changes in the development of the modern steamer ( including motor boat ) would require a large-sized volume . Only a few of the more salient features of this evolution can be discussed here , principally those having a direct bearing on the economic significance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The development of the modern steamer has brought the following important changes in mechanism and general form : ( I ) the application of steam as the propelling force in the movement of the vessel ; ( 2 ) the gradual displacement of paddle // wheels by screw-propellers ; ( 3 ) the evolution of the marine engine and boiler ; ( 4 ) the substitution for wood of iron , and later , steel as building material ; ( 5 ) great increase in the size of ships , combined with a greatly augmented number and unique arrangement of decks ; and , recently ( 6 ) the change from the coal-burning to the oil-burning steamer . The first three and the sixth of these changes are , of course , intimately associated with modern steam navigation . The fourth , though not peculiar to the steamer , has been emi-nently characteristic of it . As for the fifth the sailing vessel , while exhibiting considerable increase in size during the past century , no longer appears as a typical transoceanic liner . The great line vessels of today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all steamers . Application of steam-power . The first successful demonstration of the practicability of using steam-power to propel ships is popularly ascribed to Robert Fulton , who in August , t 8o7 , ran the Clermont by steam from New York City to Albany . The distance , 15o miles , was covered in thirty-two hours . Before this , however , Fitch , Rumsey , Evans , Living-stone , and Stevens in this country and Symington in Scotland had experimented with steam navigation . The early steamboat did not navigate on the high seas or in heavy weather . While its use had become pretty general on inland waterways before the close of the first decade after the successful sailing of Fulton 's boat , steamships for ocean trade were not constructed to any appreciable extent until about three decades later . The first steamship built for transoceanic service was the Great Western . This vessel was constructed for the Great Western Railway interests of England and was launched at Bristol in 1837 . Its initial trip was made the following year from Bristol to New York and covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time was remarkable speed . Prior to the sailing of the Great Western , transatlantic voyages had been made part , or all of the way , by steam . In 1819 occurred the well-known voyage of the Savannah from Savannah , Georgia , to Liverpool . This vessel was a sailing packet of 380 tons , equipped , however , with a 90 // horse-power engine and paddle wheels . It crossed the Atlantic in 25 days , during 18 of which steam-power was used . Another vessel , the Royal William , crossed the ocean all the way by steam in 1833 . This trip was made from Quebec via Nova Scotia to the Isle of Wight and to London , and was the first transoceanic voyage ever made all the way under steam . After the launching of the Great Western as a regular ocean carrier other steamers were constructed and operated under the management of the Transatlantic Steamship Company and the Cunard Company . The latter concern , in 1840 , put three steamships in operation . By able management and strong governmental support it soon achieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a position which it retained for a number of years . After 184o the number of ocean steamers increased rapidly . By 186o it was evident that for important kinds of traffic the steamer would displace the sailing vessel . In England the change proceeded rapidly , but in the United States much more slowly . Coal , which was the principal fuel used in the generation of steam , was more expensive in the latter country . The early steamer was in form something of a sailing vessel . The masts , yards , and sails were retained at first , and the steam-power was thus supplemented by sail power . Some steamers were essentially sailing vessels with engines installed . This was the case with the Savannah which was a sailer and not a steamer . The steam engine used in the operation of these vessels was crude and often out of order . To meet emergencies , and often to attain greater speed than steam would afford , sails would be used when winds were favorable . Paddle wheel and screw . The first ocean steamers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the paddle wheel came about gradually , and was a change of considerable significance . It was first favored by naval architects because the screw was placed below the waterline and was therefore not so exposed to the fire of the enemy as were huge paddle wheels . // The first successful application of the screw to the pro-pulsion of ships was made during the decade from 1830 to 1840 . John Ericsson , the Swedish inventor , who later at-tained great fame by building the Monitor , successfully experimented with the screw in 1836 . Francis P. Smith , an English farmer , working toward the same end , also success-fully applied the screw to the propulsion of ships . In 1839 the latter 's little ship , the Archimedes , made a very favor-able impression and led to the adoption of the screw on many of the smaller naval vessels . Before the middle of the century the screw-propeller was used by several small steamers in both Europe and the United States . The first large transatlantic ship to adopt the screw was the Great Britain , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , were preferred by most builders of merchant vessels until the latter part of the century , largely because the side-wheel steamers , up to that time , made better speed . The early marine engines were designed for driving paddle wheels , and the introduc-tion of the screw necessitated some radical changes in engine design before the new form of propulsion attained a high degree of efficiency . From 1848 to 1854 the Collins Line in the United States , the Inman Line of Liverpool , and the Allan Line all began running ships with screw-propellers . In 1859 the famous Great Eastern was completed . This giant among the ships of the period was provided with both paddle wheels and screw as well as six masts . It was not until 1862 , however , that the conservative Cunard Company put into service on the Atlantic its first screw steamer , but it was in that year , too , that it built its last paddle wheel ocean liner . Twin screws came into use about 188o , appearing first on naval vessels but soon after on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least two propellers , and some three or four . The use of paddle wheels still survives on small steamers and ferries , especially those operating over short routes along rivers or across bays . On rivers where the water is sometimes very shallow the paddle is often placed at the // rear . Ferries on bays or large rivers are commonly sidewheel vessels . The screw-propeller , however , is also being employed in the operation of this kind of craft . Marine engines and boilers . The development of the marine engine is the most important phase of the technical history of steam navigation . An outline of the successive steps in this evolution , however , would involve much technical detail which would have little significance to those with only an elementary knowledge of machinery and mechanical laws . Only a very general statement of the development of the marine engine will be attempted here . When steam was first successfully applied to water transportation , the paddle wheel was used , driven by an engine of the side-lever type with upright cylinder . The crank shaft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lever which was put at the side of the cylinder and connected with the piston rod . The early engines had a piston speed of about 170 to 190 feet a minute , and steam pressure from boilers only about to to 12 pounds per square inch . In the period of transition from the paddle wheel to screwpropeller , engines with oscillating cylinders were installed . In these engines the piston of the cylinder was attached directly to the crank shaft of the paddle wheel without lever or connecting rod . In driving a screw , however , gearing was necessary to secure sufficient speed . Boiler pressure was too low for direct-acting engines . After 186o improvements in boiler construction had been effected which resulted in much greater steam pressure and the use of direct-acting engines in operation of screw-propellers . The marine engine now generally employed is direct-acting , and the cylinders are placed inverted above the screw shaft instead of upright as in the early side-lever type . The compound engine ? the steam engine in which the working fluid used in a high-pressure cylinder is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? was successfully used as early as 1854 on the steamship Brandon , operating on the Pacific . It was not until after I 87o , however , that its use became general . By that time a boiler pressure of so pounds to the square inch was not extraordiWATER CRAFT , CLASSIFICATION 69 , nary . A further step along the same general line was the introduction of the triple expansion engine in 1881 on the Australian liner , ziberdeen . Within a decade following this , introduction several vessels had adopted this type of engine .. Another step forward in the same direction was the quad ruple expansion engine which was first used on the American Line steamers , St. Louis and St. Paul , in 1894 . The effi ciency of the quadruple expansion engine is somewhat . greater than that of the triple expansion engine . The reciprocating marine engine of today shows a remark-able advance over the engines of the fourth and fifth decades of last century . With improvements in boiler construction , , greatly augmenting steam pressure , vessel speed was in-creased in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The reciprocating engine , however , although it de velops great power , is heavy and occupies much space .. There is also considerable waste , for much of the power generated is not utilized ; this waste is characteristic of engines generally . A radically different type of engine , the turbine , which in a measure reduces these defects , has been installed in recent years in many of the largest ocean liners . The steam tur bine , of which there are two types , was invented by De Laval in Sweden in 1883 and by Parsons in England in 1884 . In both the De Laval and Parsons types power is generated by the impact of a jet of steam upon buckets placed upon the periphery of a revolving disk . ' The turbine engine has been adopted . on both naval and merchant ocean-going steamers . Since its invention it has undergone many improvements . Today there is little ques tion that its power can be secured economically . Its com pactness and lighter weight as compared with the recipro cating engine favors its general adoption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leviathan and the Majestic are equipped with turbine engines . The development of marine boilers has made possible the evolution of the marine engine . Power , while applied in // the cylinder , is generated in the boiler , and the latter determines the amount of energy available . The early boilers were flat-sided or box-shaped . The introduction of cylindrical boilers with internal furnaces dates from 1868 . With this change a much greater steam pressure was made possible . A boiler pressure of 6o pounds was attained by 1870 and loo pounds by 1880 . The introduction of the triple expansion engines called for resulted in the adoption of corrugated furnaces . The cylindrical boiler with three internal corrugated furnaces became general on merchant steamers . The large ocean liner of today is equipped with several such boilers and many furnaces . Mention may here be made of a recent and interesting type of engine in which the boiler is dispensed with . This is an internal-combustion oil engine invented by Dr. Rudolf Diesel in 1897 . Its first use as a marine engine dates from 1902-1903 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumed various forms . The Diesel engine has been adopted by a number of large and moderatesized cargo steamers and some passenger vessels . The largest passenger liners which require great horse-power and considerable speed have not adopted it , although some now under construction are reported to be installing such engines . Another kind of internal-combustion engine , the marine gas engine , is widely used in small vessels in the United States . Marine gas engines operated with gasoline , kerosine , or other light refined oils are used by yachts and small motor-boats ; and those operated with gas made from coal have been employed by several merchant vessels . While boats using these gas engines constitute a considerable proportion of the total number of the documented vessels of the United States , they form a small proportion of their total gross tonnage . Substitution of iron and steel for wood . Until very recent times , wood was used in the construction of boats and ships because it is lighter than water and will therefore float . In other words , the specific gravity of wood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The idea that a vessel still higher pressure , and this // of heavy metal could be made to float was held by very few persons until about a century ago , although boats of iron had been experimented with and successfully floated before the close of the eighteenth century . History records the building and launching of an iron boat on the River Foss in Yorkshire in 1777 . This boat was apparently intended for passenger service . Shortly afterwards iron was used for the shell plating of lighters in canal service . Before the close of the eighteenth century parts of the wooden ship began to be replaced by iron , and early in the nineteenth century " diagonal riders " were introduced to provide longitudinal strength . The use of iron as a recognized material for ship construction is often dated from the building of the lighter , Vulcan , near Glasgow in 1818 . The first ocean-going iron vessel , however , was the Rainbow , a paddle wheel ship of s 8o tons built in 1857-1858 . Objections were urged against the use of iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ float ; ( 2 ) it would be easily perforated when bumped on rocks or on the shore ; ( 3 ) the bottom could not be preserved from fouling by weeds and barnacles ; and ( 4 ) iron would make the compass untrustworthy . The first two objections were easily proved to be groundless and the third could be obviated by painting and cleaning . The fourth objection was more serious . It was found after some experience and observations that certain rules could be formulated for correcting the errors caused by the iron used in construction . A great impetus was given to the construction of iron steamers when the Great Britain , a ship of 3270 gross tons , was completed in 1844 . In 1860 about 30 per cent of the British vessel tonnage was iron . In the United States progress in the construction of iron vessels was much slower , largely because of the higher cost of iron and the comparative cheapness of wood . Steel began to be used as construction material in the decade of 187o-1880 . The introduction of the Bessemer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before had greatly reduced the cost of steel . This material has several advantages over iron for shipbuilding purposes . // It is a more homogeneous and uniform metal , and it is stronger and more trustworthy . British builders rapidly adopted steel , and in 1886 the steel tonnage of the United Kingdom exceeded the iron tonnage . In the United States progress in this direction was slow . Even after the open ing of the present century over half of this country 's vessel tonnage was still wood . Today steel is the principal material used in the construc tion of ships . Of the world 's vessel tonnage included in Lloyd 's Register of Shipping in recent years over 95 per cent is built of steel . ( See Chapter V. ) Increase in size of ships . The growth in size of modern ships is quite as phenomenal as the mechanical improvements made in the construction of their marine engines or the changes in building material . From ancient times to the beginning of the nineteenth century only very large vessels exceeded i5o feet in length . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 400 or Soo gross tons was considered large , although ships of much greater size were occasionally built . The development of steam navigation and the con struction of iron , and later of steel , vessels was accompanied with a great increase in their size . This increase has been especially marked since the introduction of steel as shipbuild ing material . In the table on page 73 are listed some of the largest steamers built during the period from 184o to 1921 with their length , beam , and tonnage . In the table , the figures for tonnage and dimensions are those for vessels which were very large or exceptional for the years in which they were completed . As late as 1875 a steamer in excess of 5000 gross tons was still regarded as extraordinary in size . The Great Eastern of nearly 19,000 gross tons , completed in 1859 , had been a conspicuous fail ure and was regarded by many as showing limits in size beyond which steam operation would be impossible.10 To-day a 5000-ton steamer is very ordinary ; and the great // transatlantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With increase in size the modern steamer has shown some important changes in the structure of its hull and in the number and character of its decks . The hull of a modern steamer is something more than a simple boat-like form for floating in the water , in which interior space is divided by two or three decks running the entire length of the ship . It is divided by bulkheads into water-tight compartments and has a double bottom within which water may be carried as ballast . The hold of the present-day steamer varies greatly according to the needs of the traffic carried . In certain " bulk-carriers , " like the ore steamers of the Great Lakes and the tank vessels operating along our coasts , ship con struction shows a high degree of specialization ? the whole // design being adapted to the transportation of a single kind of freight . The number of decks has also greatly increased in the larger modern steamers . The early ocean-going steamers usually had two or three decks , as have also the simpler and smaller cargo vessels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vessel . Above the main deck , 11 if there were two ? or the upper deck if there were three ? were usually the superstructures known as forecastle , bridge , and poop . In many vessels the main deck from the bridge to the stern would be raised four or five feet in order to increase the cargo capacity of the afterhold and prevent trimming toward the bow . The larger cargo and also the leading passenger and express steamers today have at least four full decks with one or more decks in addition which do not extend the whole length of the vessel . The largest trans-oceanic liners may have as many as eight or ten full-length decks with additional part-length decks . A conspicuous feature of the large passenger liners of today is the building of elaborate superstructures above the hulls . The increased size of the modern steamer has , of course , meant greater carrying capacity . The deck structure of the larger passenger and combination passenger and freight liners provides more passenger space , facilitates classifica tion of passengers , and enables the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ express , and the various kinds of freight . Change from coal to oil as fuel . An innovation which in the future may be of much economic significance is the recent adoption by several steamers of oil in the place of coal as fuel . This change is not to be confused with the use of oil in the Diesel and other internal-combustion engines . ( See page 7o . ) What is referred to here is the simple // substitution of fuel oil for coal , irrespective of the kind of engines used . For several years crude petroleum has been used in the United States as fuel in railroad transportation , particularly in the Far West where coal is scarce and oil relatively abund ant and cheap . It has also been employed in the operation of naval vessels . The conservation , therefore , of oil re-serves for naval use in certain parts of the world has played an important role in recent international politics . During the World War much of the mercantile shipping built under the auspices of the United States Shipping Board to repair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of the largest steamers of the American merchant marine are equipped for the use of fuel oil . This adoption of oil in the place of coal is significant in many particulars . Important economies in labor and fuel space are achieved . The steaming radius of an oil-burning vessel is much greater ordinarily than that of a coal-burning vessel , thus making it more independent of fuel stations . Among the more important gains subserved by the use of oil are the following:l2 ( i ) Less bunker space for a given steaming radius than is possible with coal . Storage between double-bottoms where neither coal nor cargo can be stored . Greater despatch in bunkering than in the case of coal . ( q . ) No labor and machinery required for handling ashes . Dispensing with stoking and consequent reduction in the size of crew and in labor cost . Greater thermal efficiency than coal coupled with reduction of fuel costs.13 The advantages of fuel oil over coal will make themselves // felt in the development and distribution of vessel tonnage if the supply of raw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material increase in cost . Speed and accommodations of modern steamers . Be-fore steam was applied to the propulsion of ships , a trans-atlantic voyage between the United States and Great Britain lasted from two to four weeks . At the beginning of the twentieth century the time had been reduced to about six days on fast vessels ; and since that time the period has been further reduced to about five days.14 A trip from Great Britain to Australia , which formerly took about 13 weeks by sailing vessel , now requires 30 days or less in an ordi nary steamer . On the Atlantic the fastest steamers operat ing between New York and British and French ports main tain a speed of 2S to 27 knots per hour over the whole course , as compared with 12 knots by the fastest sailing vessels three-quarters of a century ago . The recently built Bremen achieved an average of 28.18 knots per hour , and for one hour attained the record speed of 29.6 knots . The services and accommodations of modern passenger ships are elaborate and palatial compared with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle decades of the nineteenth century . The Leviathan , the largest vessel of the American merchant marine and from the standpoint of aggregate gross tonnage the largest afloat , requires the services of a crew of 1200 . The interior furnishings of its cabins and staterooms for first-class pas sengers are as elaborate as those of the largest and most expensive hotels . Summary . Water carriers may be roughly divided into three general classes : ( 1 ) steamers ( including motor boats ) , which have the power of self-propulsion ; ( 2 ) sailing vessels , which depend upon wind power ; and ( 3 ) unrigged craft , // which require for movement steam or animal power from the outside . In addition to these classes are oar-propelled boats which at present are commercially unimportant and are used mainly for pleasure or for supplementary or emer-gency operations . The term ship is now applied to large boats or vessels capable of navigating the ocean and usually built for that purpose . At one time , however , it had a more technical significance , being applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The technique of shipbuilding showed little change from the dawn of history to the great geographical discoveries of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries , or indeed until the in-troduction of steam as a motive power a little over a century ago . Since that time the development has been rapid . Some of the principal phases of this development are the following : the application of steam as a propelling force in the movement of vessels ; the gradual displacement of paddle wheels by screw-propellers ; the evolution of the marine en-gine and boiler ; the substitution for wood of iron and later steel as building material ; the great increase in the size of ships ; and the recent change from the use of coal to that of oil as fuel . The steamer built of steel is the typical ship of ocean commerce . CH1IPTER I THE WORLD 'S VESSEL TONNAGE , ITS GENERAL CHARACTER AND DISTRIBUTION Number and tonnage of world 's shipping . The vessel ton nage of the world exhibits some noteworthy features with reference to general character , recent growth , and distribu tion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lloyd 's Register of Shipping , however , are tables containing the number and tonnage of practically all the steamers of the world of ioo gross tons register or over and all sailing vessels of ioo net tons or more . ' Such a table for June 1930 , showing this tonnage , divided into steamers , motor ships , and sailing ves sels , and according to material of construction , is shown on page 79 . The shipping included in the figures tabulated embraces the great bulk of the world 's vessels of commercial signifi cance . Ordinary unrigged craft like barges and flats and most boats operated in various auxiliary services of a purely local character are omitted . Such vessels are usually small in size , but in the aggregate are sufficient to make a material addition not only to the numbers given but even to the tonnages. 78 // Naval vessels , or vessels built exclusively for war pur poses , are also excluded . In another chapter it has been pointed out that such craft are usually measured in displace ment tons rather than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are sometimes so constructed that they can be readily used as auxiliary cruisers in the event of war . Such vessels are usually owned and operated by companies receiving subsidies from the government . They are essen tially merchant ships and are therefore included in the table . It is worthy of note that of the 32,713 vessels recorded in Lloyd 's Register 29,996 , or about 91 per cent , were steamers . Of the total vessel tonnage , aggregating 69 , - 607,644 gross tons , 68,023,804 tons , or nearly 98 per cent , were for steam and motor vessels . The vessels constructed of steel ( steam , motor , and sail ) numbered 26,579 , or a little over 8o per cent of the total , and their gross tonnage amounted to 66,978,297 , or about 96 per cent of the total . 8o OCEAN TRANSPORTATION The higher percentages for tonnages as compared with number in the cases of both steam and steel vessels show that the larger merchant craft tend to belong to these two classes . Of the sailing ships less than 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , constituted over one-third of their total gross tonnage . The predominance of the steamer in the world 's merchant marine makes desirable some further classification of the vessels coming under this general designation . Dividing the totals for this general group according to the types of engines used the results in number and tonnage are the following : These figures show that the greater part of the world 's steam tonnage is equipped with reciprocating engines . It is to be observed , however , that while steamers with turbine engines constituted less than five per cent of the total num-ber they included nearly 14 per cent of the total steam ton-nage . Mention has been made that the largest transatlantic liners are equipped with turbine engines . Included in the figures for steam tonnage are those for certain highly specialized forms of vessels used in connection with industrial operations and often owned by producing concerns . Thus tankers for the carriage of petroleum and its products and trawlers and other fishing vessels constitute an appreciable fraction of the world 's total steam tonnage . In June 1929 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) numbered 1236 with a total of 6,987,922 , 987,922 tons . // This class of vessels includes steamers of considerable size as the figures just cited indicate . ' The greater part of the world 's steam tonnage uses coal for fuel . However , the number and the tonnage of oilburning steamers are great , and during the past decade have shown a pronounced tendency to increase . In June 1929 , steamers of Ioo gross tons and over fitted for burning fueloil numbered 3787 with an aggregate gross tonnage of 19,420,895 . While the steamer has shown a pronounced tendency to increase in size , the number having a small or moderate tonnage is large . Classified according to size the steamers , as recorded by Lloyd , may be grouped as follows : It will be observed that nearly half the total number are less than 1 000 gross tons register each , and that there is a very decided falling off in the number of steamers having a gross tonnage in excess of 8000 . Only 63 steamers have a gross tonnage of 20,000 or over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transatlantic liners operating between Europe and North America . Something over one-third of the world 's steamers recorded in Lloyd have a tonnage in excess of 2000 ; but this third carries nearly all the long-distance passenger traffic going by water and the greater part of the ocean freight . Recent growth of the world 's merchant marine . The development of the world 's merchant marine in recent years has been characterized by growth in tonnage rather than in // number of vessels . If the vessels large enough to be included in Lloyd 's Register be totalled and their aggregate tonnages tabulated for successive years during the last three and a half decades , the number will exhibit comparatively slight and uncertain variations , but the tonnages will show a fairly steady increase . This feature of the growth of modern shipping may be illustrated by taking the years 1891 , 1900 , 1910 , 1920 , and 1930 , and giving the number and tonnages for each . Another feature of the recent history of the world 's mer-chant marine is the change in the relative number and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessels greatly outnumbered steamers , although the gross tonnage of the latter had already exceeded that of the former . The change in number and tonnage of the two classes of vessels is shown for the same years in the following figures : The decline in the number and tonnage of sailing ships during the period covered by the years named was marked // and rapid . This decline in number was offset by a corre-sponding increase in the number of steamers ; and the de-crease in tonnage , by a much greater advance in the tonnage of steam vessels . The figures for the years 1910 and 1920 do not on the surface show abnormal changes for this decade because of the war conditions which prevailed from 1914 to 1918 . An estimate made , however , by the Board of Trade Journal ( London ) in August 1919 , based upon the figures published by Lloyd 's Register in June of that year compared with the normal rate of increase shown for the years immediately preceding the World War indicated that the world 's total for steam tonnage was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been if the war had not taken place . ' This heavy loss , however , was being reduced throughout the years 1919 and 1920 by the building of ves-sels contracted for during the later stages of the War . The struggle did effect a national redistribution of shipping which was more radical in nature and probably more nearly perma-nent than its general influence on the world 's growth of shipping . We may , therefore , discuss ( 1 ) the present-day distribution among the principal merchant marine nations ; ( 2 ) the distribution of tonnage within the two leading countries ; and ( 3 ) the effect of the World War . Distribution of shipping . The distribution of shipping among the nations of the world bears some relationship to commercial activity ? a relationship , however , by no means close . In other words , while volume of commerce is no criterion of the extent of a nation 's merchant marine , peoples engaged in a large oversea trade are likely to carry at least a part of this traffic in their own vessels . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world , political motives constitute an added incentive to the build-ing-up of a national merchant marine . Many other factors , some of them of greater importance , help to determine the extent of a country 's shipping . In June 1930 , the world 's vessel tonnage as recorded by Lloyd was divided as is shown in the table on page 84. // It will be observed that a little over one-third of the world 's vessel tonnage included in this table was British . Of this British shipping 20,438,444 gross tons belonged to Great Britain and Ireland , the remainder being part of the merchant marine of the " Overseas Dominions . " The United States tonnage constituted a little less than onequarter of the world 's total . Practically all the American shipping belonged to the continental United States , a very small proportion being allotted to the Philippines . The sailing vessel tonnage of the British Empire is small compared with the size of its total merchant marine . The United States , on the other hand , with less than one-fourth of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a long time conditions in this country were more favorable for the building of sailing vessels than for the construction of steamers . It is worthy of note that Japan ranks third among the nations of the world in the size of its mercantile fleet , even when its sailing tonnage is not included . Distribution of British shipping . Although the greater part of the British mercantile fleet is owned and documented in Great Britain , an appreciable portion belongs to its overseas dominions . In 1930 nearly three million gross tons were allotted to colonial possessions . The general distribution of the British fleet is indicated in the table below : In the British possessions , as well as in the British Isles , the great bulk of the vessel tonnage is steam or motor . The // coastal fleet of Canada , however , is about 8% per cent sail ? a large proportion for any of the larger parts of the British Empire . It is interesting to note that of the shipping of the vast overseas dominions of the Empire nearly half the gross tonnage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today shows a large sea-going tonnage , much of it engaged in foreign trade . Before the outbreak of the World War a considerable part of the American merchant marine operated on the Great Lakes . Since that time this part of the American fleet has remained almost stationary , while the sea-going fleet has greatly increased . Only a very insignificant proportion of the American merchant marine is documented in the outlying or insular possessions of the country . In the table on page 84 the distribution of American shipping , as recorded in Lloyd 's Register , is shown with respect to the parts operating on the sea , on the Great Lakes , and in the Philippines . In the years immediately preceding the outbreak of the World War the sea-going tonnage was approximately equal or slightly less than that on the Great Lakes . In June 1930 , it was more than four times the Great Lakes tonnage . The large proportion of the world 's sail tonnage documented in the United States has already been mentioned . This part of the world 's merchant marine is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of the United States . In June 1925 , American sea-going sailing vessels aggregated 1,017,070 gross tons . Five years later they totalled only 742,6,37 gross tons . Effect of the World War . How far the world conflict of 1914 to 1918 has permanently affected the general growth of the world 's merchant marine is difficult to state with any precision . Special efforts were made during the course of the struggle and immediately afterwards to replace vessels which were destroyed by submarine activity . These efforts were sufficiently successful to enable Lloyd 's Register to show a larger world tonnage for June 1919 , when the first comprehensive and reliable edition was issued since the War began , than for June 1914 . It should be said in this con // nection that much of the newly built shipping was hastily and poorly constructed . The most notable immediate effect , however , of the War was the redistribution of tonnage among the nations of the world . This redistribution can be well indicated by tabulating in round numbers the steam tonnages of the leading commercial nations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and noting the gains and losses of each , as follows : The most noteworthy feature of the redistribution of mer chant shipping as a result of the War was the great in-crease in the tonnage of sea-going steamers for the United States , amounting to 382 per cent . By virtue of this in-crease this country became a fairly close second to United Kingdom in the size of its merchant fleet . Japan showed a substantial increase in its steam tonnage during the War period , and after the transfers of ships from Germany to the nations of the Entente had been effected , that country // took third rank . The United Kingdom , Germany , Greece , Austria-Hungary , and Norway all exhibited considerable decline in the sizes of their merchant fleets during the five-year period covered in the table . In Germany the reduction was greater than the figures show . The greater part of the shipping included in the 3,247,000 gross tons assigned to that country for 1919 was taken over by the nations with which she had been at war ; and in June 1920 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , amounted to only 672,671 gross tons . ' Upon the basis of an assumed normal growth the losses and gains of the world 's merchant marine would have to be figured differently . According to one estimate already referred to ( see page 83 ) , the net result of the War so far as steam tonnage is concerned was a loss of 7,473,000 gross tons . In other words , assuming a normal rate of increase for the years from 1914 to 1919 on the basis of the proportionate growth for the years immediately preced ing 1914 , the world 's steamships would have been 7,473,000 gross tons in excess ' of what they were in 1919 had war not occurred . According to this estimate only the United States and Japan among the important commercial countries made any gains ? the former ( including both sea-going and Great Lakes steamers ) , 6,729,000 gross tons , and Japan 20,000 gross tons . The British losses aggregated 5,202,000 gross tons ; the German , 3,582,000 gross tons ; and the Norwegian , 1,025,000 gross tons . ' Figures based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but may be misleading . With reference to net results it is highly probable that not only in 1919 but also a decade later the world 's merchant marine has been somewhat smaller than it would otherwise have been as a result of the World War . Despite the devastation wrought by German submarines the vessel tonnage did increase dur ing the war period ? doubtless at the expense of much sacrifice and effort . And there has been , of course , a greater increase since the close of the War . // It may be of some interest in this connection to note actual losses in vessel tonnage during the years of the War . Lloyd 's Register contains figures concerning the number and tonnage of ships lost and broken up each year . For the years 1914 ? 1919 they are as follows : During the years 1915 ? 1918 the great bulk of the " lost " tonnage consisted of boats destroyed by submarine activity . The relatively small number and tonnage of vessels " broken up , " especially in the later years of the lVar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships as possible . Many vessels regarded in ordinary times as unseaworthy were used and operated in the place of others which had fallen victims to the ravages of war . The especially heavy losses for 1917 were in pursuance of the German policy of unre-stricted submarine warfare adopted early that year . During the spring of 1917 the average monthly loss was nearly 1,000,000 tons . During the summer and fall , and during 1918 , the devastation was greatly checked by the use of con-voys , the elaborate employment of mines , the invention of devices for detecting the presence of submarines , and other contrivances . ' To what extent this war devastation has permanently affected the distribution of the world 's merchant marine is not easy to state . But it may be observed that in 1929 the // ranks of the various merchant marine nations were approximating pretty close to the positions they held in 1914 . The British fleet , while forming a somewhat smaller proportion of the world 's tonnage than in 1914 , has been increasing in recent years , and is far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Germany , which lost about 85 per cent of its merchant marine under the Treaty of Versailles , is now recovering from this set-back with remarkable rapidity . In June 1929 , it had attained the rank of fourth among the shipping nations of the world . Norway , the fourth leading country in the size of its mercantile fleet in 1914 , suffered severely as a result of the War . Though a neutral it lost many vessels at the hands of its more powerful belligerent neighbors . Lately , however , its merchant marine has been forging ahead at a rapid rate , and in June 1930 was in advance of the fleets of France and Italy . The great impetus which the War gave to the growth of the American merchant marine seems largely to have spent its force . At any rate , since 1922 there has been some decline in the shipping tonnage of the United States , especially in that part of it engaged in foreign trade . Comparing vessel tonnage a decade after the close of the World War with that of 1914 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which favored shipping development in the pre-war years are operative today . Notwithstanding many and great changes in technique , these changes are not such as make for any radical redistribution of shipping tonnage among the nations of the world . In this respect they are different from those which were taking place at the time of the American Civil War . ( See Chapter XXI . ) Summary . On June 30 , 1930 , the world 's merchant marine as recorded in Lloyd 's Register of Shipping numbered 32,713 vessels with an aggregate gross tonnage of 69,607,644 . Of these totals about 91 per cent of the number and about 98 per cent of the gross tonnage were for steamers and motor boats . About 96 per cent of the tonnage was constructed of steel . While the steamer has shown a pronounced tendency to increase in size nearly half the total number recorded in Lloyd 's Register are less than 1 000 // gross tons each . There is a rapid falling-off in the number of vessels with gross tonnages exceeding 8000 , and only 63 had gross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , in the size of ocean carriers is shown by the fact that between the years 1891 and 1930 the ' number of vessels recorded in Lloyd shows little change but the aggregate gross tonnage for the latter year is more than three times that of the former . The distribution of shipping among the nations of the world bears some , but not very close , relationship to com-mercial activity . The leading mercantile marine countries in 1930 , from the standpoint of total gross tonnage of ship-ping , were the following in the order named : British Empire , United States , Japan , Germany , Norway , France , Italy , Holland , Sweden , Greece , Spain , and Denmark . About one-third of the world 's tonnage was British , and nearly one-fourth , American . The great bulk of the British shipping was allotted to Great Britain and Ireland . The most conspicuous immediate effect of the World War was the phenomenal increase in the sea-going tonnage of the United States . Most European countries , especially Germany and her allies , lost heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , the leading merchant marine nations of the world are tending to be the same as those in the years immediately preceding the outbreak of hostilities . This tendency would seem to indicate that recent changes in shipping technique are not of a character making for any radical redistribution of shipping tonnage among the nations of the world . Part III WATER ROUTES AND TERMINALS CHJPTER ICI WATER ROUTES General nature of water routes . In general , water routes are less definitely fixed than land routes . This is particularly true of ocean highways . The routes of river and canal carriers are for all practical purposes as clearly defined as those of land carriers . But they have much less significance for the commerce of the world today than have ocean highways , and overland traffic shows a pronounced tendency to choose the railroad or the motor vehicle , rather than the river steamer or the canal boat . ( i ) One of the first noteworthy characteristics of an ocean highway is that it is not limited to a single narrow roadbed or right of way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship movement , and the ocean route therefore is an ill-defined course along which vessels usually travel in carrying traffic from one port or district to another rather than a clearly marked lane whose position can be definitely shown on a map . Vessels taking such a course may touch at two or more ports in the same general region which are not on the direct line of the journey , but yet near enough to be in substantially the same direction from the original port of sailing . The outward and inward voyages may be made on the same general route although the precise lines of passage may be many miles apart . ( z ) Another feature of ocean routes is the frequency with which they are the main highways for one-way traffic . Much of the world 's commerce is a three- or four-cornered affair . Regions producing and exporting large amounts of 92 // certain kinds of goods do not always receive their principal imports from the countries or areas in which they have marketed these goods . The exports are paid for in goods and services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or services ) from the land receiving the origi nal exports . In other words , the route for such commerce is not a single highway or course between two ports , but a sort of triangle whose sides for the most part constitute one-way lanes of trade . Where such triangular routes appear , the carriers are usually " tramps . " I Closely connected with the feature just mentioned is the flexibility of ocean routes . A change in the relative traffic possibilities of different ports making some alteration in the usual courses of vessel movements involves no great sacrifice of capital which has been invested in a roadway . The carrier operating on the high seas is free to change routes whenever traffic conditions warrant without any con cern for expenditures for roadbed , aside from what invest ments of a fixed character may have been made at abandoned terminals . A change from one roadbed to another on the part of a railroad always involves some abandonment of a previous capital outlay , and in some instances means for the time being a great sacrifice . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maintenance of highly com petitive conditions in ocean shipping . A fourth characteristic of water routes in general , and ocean routes in particular , is their freedom from pro prietary ownership or control . On the high seas no nation has any exclusive jurisdiction determining the direction taken by carriers moving from one port to another or fixing the conditions on which any given ocean highway can be used . No company of course can appropriate such a route , making it an exclusive right of way . The sea is an open highway , and every vessel is free to determine its own course in mov ing from one place to another . The economic significance // of this freedom and lack of exclusive proprietorship has already been discussed.2 While ocean highways are practically free so far as use is concerned , some national or state control is exercised over the ocean immediately bordering a country and over interior waterways . Modern international law has recognized sov sovereign rights over the high seas to a distance of one league from shore . The practical effect of this principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased range of weapons of war , ' and in some measure by efforts to regulate effectively or to prohibit entirely the trade in certain com modities. ? National jurisdiction nevertheless is recognized on ocean highways only in the case of those waters which are in close proximity to coast lines . National sovereignty is also exercised over bays , rivers , and other interior waterways . Where such a waterway , a navigable river , for example , divides two countries , the use of that waterway is guaranteed to both countries ; and the boundary line is held to run along the middle of the stream , or inlet . The waterway is not de jure a possible route for the carriers of other nations , although international treaties usually give them the right of navigation . Where a navig able river rises in one country and discharges in or through another , international law does not recognize the claim of the upper state to navigate in or through the waters of the lower state . However , in most commercial countries such rivers are open to world commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large bodies of water , are also subject to national jurisdiction . Generally they are governed by the laws of the country under whose authorization they were built . Where they form connecting links along important routes of commerce their use is gen erally open in ordinary times by international treaties to the vessels of practically all nations under substantially the same // conditions . Such canals are usually short , and form an insignificant fraction of the highways of commerce . Individual or company proprietorship over water routes is very rare along highways of commercial importance . In terior canals are sometimes built and utilized by mining and other companies for the exclusive transportation of their own products . Such waterways , however , constitute a negli gible part of the world 's water routes . It should be noted in this connection that the terminals of water routes are ordinarily subject to more or less govern ment regulation of a local or national character . In addi tion to such regulation individual or company proprietor-ship is often exercised over docks and wharves , and this condition has some significance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The subject of terminals will be treated in another chapter 5 and is mentioned here only as a modifying condition to the general rule that water routes are free and subject to the jurisdiction or control of no nation or company . The control exercised by national authority over coastal and interior waterways often limits their use as routes to certain carriers . The most important limitation of this character is the common one already referred to in an earlier chapter s reserving port-to-port shipping within a country to vessels documented at the ports of the country . This limi tation does not usually alter the routing of water-borne traf fic , but it does determine the nationality of the carriers within the region affected and constitutes a further modification of the principle of free routing above discussed . On the high seas , which constitute over 70 per cent of the earth 's surface , the lanes of commerce are free to all vessels not violating such customs as are embodied in the law of nations . They are subject to no national jurisdiction nor to any proprietary control . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect to ocean high-ways and most enclosed bodies of water large enough to be i // designated as seas . Subject to the restrictions and general control above mentioned in the case of coastal and interior waterways and interoceanic canals the water surface of the earth is open to the shipping of practically all nations on the same or similar terms through numerous international treaties . Conditions affecting water routes . The routes followed by water carriers are determined mainly by the abundance of traffic offered in certain areas and the market possibilities with respect to this traffic in other areas so located that the latter are readily reached by water . This condition implies reciprocal relations or interchange of commodities ( or services ) between producing and consuming areas . A nation or a region importing certain goods pays for such products largely by exporting certain other commodities either to the country from which the imported goods come or to some third nation having commercial relations with this country . If the direct interchange of goods is large , as it is between the North Atlantic coast of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passenger and freight , will be carried by line vessels , and the route as plotted or indicated on a map will assume the appearance of a broad band between the two trading areas . If commerce between two regions is largely indirect , the route tends to assume a triangular or quadrangular aspect . Over such routes traffic is carried very largely in " tramps . " In other words , carriers generally operate irregularly and return to their original or home port over a course different from that of the outgoing voyage . While traffic and market conditions determine the general direction of water routes and to a considerable extent the location of their terminals , other factors exert a modifying influence . The sphericity of the earth , the size of land masses lying between trade areas , fuel stations and fuel costs , the existence of interoceanic canals , and on some voyages and especially in the case of sailing vessels weather conditions are important influences . On account of the spherical shape of the earth the shortest distance between two points in approximately the same latitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arc of a circle rather than a line along the same parallel . This fact influences the form of nearly all ocean routes across the North Atlantic and the North Pacific . Kobe in Japan , for example , is almost directly west of San Francisco , but the shortest route from the California port to Japan curves northward to the Aleutian Islands and then southwestwardly to point of destination . A glance at a globe instead of a map on Mercator 's projection will show why this is so . Fuel stations and fuel costs are also modifying factors in present-day ocean routes . The improvement of the modern marine engine and the change from coal to oil as fuel in many recent vessels have increased the steaming radius of the present-day ocean carrier . As a result it is no longer necessary to make frequent circuits to out-of-the-way coaling stations , as formerly . Refueling , however , is necessary for all steamers after they have traveled any great distance . On very long voyages ocean routes must be determined for such vessels with reference to refueling facilities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the expense of operating steamers is that of fuel . Any substantial and permanent increase in the price of coal or oil along a given route as compared with other routes is likely to cause a material change in the amount of traffic or a radical alteration in the course which the traffic takes . The building of interoceanic canals during the last fifty years has both shortened earlier routes and established others . As already indicated , the Suez and Panama Canals have greatly reduced the length of journeys between North Atlantic ports and the Orient . The development of direct and regular trade between the Atlantic and Gulf ports of the United States and Pacific coast ports in South America has been a direct outcome of the building of the Panama Canal . The enormous traffic between upper and lower lake ports in the Great Lakes region was made possible by the Sault Ste. Marie ( St. Mary 's ) Canals , which may be classed among the canals connecting large bodies of water . Today weather conditions affect the courses taken by ocean carriers much less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence . Sailing vessels of course are affected by the general direction of winds and currents . A sailboat from New York to Rio Janeiro will usually steer eastward to the vicinity of the Azores and then turn south , and on reaching the tropics will take advantage of the northeast trade winds north of the Equator and southeast trade winds south of that line . This involves a longer journey than a direct route but it is quicker for a sailing vessel . Even steamers are to some extent influenced in their courses by wind movements . Most freighters going to New Zealand from Atlantic ports sail round the Cape of Good Hope , but return via Cape Horn . The westerly winds , or " Roaring Forties , " of those latitudes materially reduce the speed of steamers " bucking the winds " by sailing westward , and accelerate it when sailing in the opposite direction . Important ocean trunk line routes . For reasons already stated precise designation of ocean routes is impossible . Ocean routes are many , and vary greatly in importance . Some , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides of triangular or quadrangular courses . Many receive numerous tributaries along ' the way and have several offshoots before the main route reaches the port or the region of destination . While ocean routes are difficult to describe with accuracy , general statements can be made as to the lanes along which the principal traffic of the world is carried . The ocean routes along which the heaviest traffic is carried run for the most part east and west in the North Temperate Zone , since the largest producing and consuming nations live in this region , especially on the eastern and western shores of the Atlantic . The large trade through the Mediterranean Sea between North Atlantic ports both in Europe and in America and in southern and southeastern Asia is in a sense a part of this eastern and western movement and in another sense a survival of the old trade between medieval Venice and Genoa and the Orient , part of which was necessarily overland . The development of highly civilized nations and communities in recent times in the South Temperate Zone and the increasing importance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the growth of several routes whose general direction is north and south . At present they are inferior in volume of trade to the east and west routes further north , and in many instances they may be said to be tributary to them . The trunk line having the heaviest freight and passenger traffic is the one connecting the North Atlantic seaports of the United States with those served by steamers entering or passing through the English Channel . Tributary to this line , and indeed practically a part of it , are branches in the west extending to ports on the St. Lawrence River and on the South Atlantic coast of the United States . Near the eastern end of this route is an important branch extending north before the English Channel is reached and serving ports on the west coast of England , of which the most nota ble is that of Liverpool . On this trunk line ply the world 's largest steamers , and from one-fifth to one-sixth of the world 's vessel tonnage . This route is especially notable for the number of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic and the . large amount of " high grade " freight , mail , and express packages carried . The principal terminals of this route are located in the leading commercial countries of the world . On the Pacific a similar but much longer route connects ports from San Diego , California , to Vancouver , British Columbia , with ports in Japan and China . As has been indicated in another connection , vessels plying on this ocean highway do not follow parallels of latitude but move north-ward in the course of their journey , passing near the Aleutian Islands . The leading ports on the American end of this route are San Francisco and Seattle , and on the Asiatic end Kobe and Yokohama 7 in Japan and Shanghai in China . The traffic carried along this route while growing in importance is only a fraction of that on the transatlantic line just dis cussed . Although the population of China and Japan ex ceeds that of Europe , the per capita productive and consumWATER ROUTES iot ing power is much less . On the Pacific Coast of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very great but its population relatively sparse . Hence the transpacific trade is comparatively limited . Some of this transoceanic freight , however , is also shipped by rail across the American conti nent . Raw silk , for example , from Japan does not stop on the Pacific Coast , but goes to the silk mills of New Jersey and Pennsylvania . ' One of the longest ocean trunk routes and one having the heaviest traffic next to the one across the Atlantic , above mentioned , is the route extending from North Atlantic ports of western and southern Europe and the eastern United States through the Mediterranean and Red Seas via the Suez Canal to India , the East Indies , China , and Japan . This line has many tributaries all along its course . Some of the most important Oriental and tropical products used in present-day manufactures find their way to western Europe and the United States along this route . Passenger traffic is moderately large . Round-the-world steamer tours usually follow this line on journeys through the Orient and the Red and Mediterranean Seas . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from American and European ports to the East Indies , China , and Japan was around Africa , and sailing vessels , as has been stated , still take this course as wind conditions on the Red Sea prevent their making use of the Suez Canal . In medieval times the East Indian trade passed overland , either between Mediterranean ports and points on the Euphrates River or between the Nile River and the Red Sea , thence making the obvious water connections east and west . The voyages of Diaz and Vasco da Gama late in the fifteenth century changed this route for a time . The opening of the Suez Canal partially restored it and made it an all-water route . A fourth trunk line is one from North Atlantic ports to those in southern and southeastern Africa . An eastern ex1oz OCEAN TRANSPORTATION tension of this route goes to Australia and New Zealand . Some of the ships along this line engage in the West African coasting trade . There is a moderate passenger traffic between northern Europe and Cape Town . That part of the route extending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessels , of which there is a considerable tonnage . Passengers and mail carried between western Europe and Australia and New Zealand go for the most part through the Suez Canal . For freight steamers the route around Africa , while longer , has an advantage in avoiding the tolls imposed on the passage through the Canal ; and for ordinary freight vessels engaged in the Australian trade this advantage more than offsets the handicap of greater distance . A trunk route of growing importance is that connecting North Atlantic ports with those of Brazil , Argentina , and other South American countries . Buenos Aires in Argentina is the leading port of the southern hemisphere . The bulk of its foreign commerce , as well as that of Santos and Rio Janeiro in Brazil , is with the United States and western Europe . Some branches connect this general line with ports in the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico . One branch which promises considerable development in the near future connects Pacific Coast ports in the United States through the Panama Canal . The freight traffic along this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tramp vessels . The passenger service in late years has shown much growth . A route of less importance than the one just mentioned , but developed as a result of the opening of the Panama Canal , is from North Atlantic ports through the Caribbean Sea and the Canal to the west coast of South America . Before the Panama Canal affected trade routes , steamers plying between North Atlantic ports and the west coast of South America went via the Straits of Magellan . This trade has now been diverted to the Isthmian route . The traffic between western South America and the North Atlantic is largely freight . Some tourist business , however , is done on that part of the route which includes the passage south along the Pacific coast to Valparaiso , Chile , where the passenger // disembarks for the trans-Andean railroad across Argentina and Chile . The trade of the West Indies and of the Latin-American countries along the coasts of the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico with the United States and Europe can hardly be said to constitute a route . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This water-borne commerce , however , is large and growing , and should be mentioned in connection with the lanes of ocean commerce . The shipments of raw sugar and tropical fruits to the United States constitute an important part of the many-sided trade of this region . Another route which should be mentioned is the Pacific Coast-Australasian trunk line . The principal North American termini of this route are Vancouver , British Columbia , and San Francisco . The western termini are in New Zealand and Australia . The sailings are either via Honolulu , Samoa , or Fiji , or via Tahiti in the Society Islands . In this route may be included the traffic between the United States , the Hawaiian , and Philippine Islands . Although the Pacific Coast-Australian trunk line has been characterized by a rather limited traffic , it has been part of the fast mail route from Australia to Europe . Mail was transferred at Vancouver or San Francisco from steamer to railroad train and thence shipped across the continent to Halifax or New York where it was again transferred to steamers bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States and the Philippines which touches at Guam and Samoa . Since the Panama Canal was opened some of the Pacific Coast-Australasia traffic has been diverted to the Canal route . A new trunk line is virtually in process of development between Atlantic Coast ports and Australasia . Triangular routes . The general routes or trunk lines mentioned are but few of many lanes followed by ocean shipping . Furthermore , there is more or less crossing and recrossing from one ocean track to another . In describing certain routes as trunk lines , therefore , it must be understood that along these lines there is a considerable amount of traffic moving back and forth with at least a fair degree of con104 OCEAN TRANSPORTATION stancy . This does not imply , however , that the traffic in both directions is the same in volume or in value . An ocean route , as has been pointed out , may with respect to part of its traffic be one side of a triangle or quadrangle which a vessel describes on its voyage from its home port until its return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are often made by tramp vessels but also by freight liners , and are likely to be less stable than the lanes used by " liners . " A few triangular routes which are well-known may be indicated . A vessel carrying a cargo from England to Brazil or Argentina will frequently transport freight from these countries to the United States and American exports back to England . A ship moving from New York to South Africa will not infrequently proceed to India or Australia for a cargo to Europe and thence carry European goods to the United States . Professor Johnson notes that the United States Steel Corporation , in order to operate a profitable line from New York to Vancouver , found it necessary on the return voyage to carry lumber or coal from Vancouver to the Gulf of California , cargoes of copper matte from Mexico to Dunkirk , France , and finally return to New York with cargoes of French chalk . Triangular voyages , common as they are , and significant in the world 's trade , have a good deal of individuality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which commerce flows with more or less regularity . A vessel may visit a port taking a large cargo on a return voyage and never again call at that port because of more promising cargoes elsewhere . Nevertheless , in discussing water routes mention should be made of these irregular sailings , as they play a big part in ocean commerce . Interior water routes . In a discussion of water routes mention should be made of important inland or interior waterways . In most commercial countries the use of rivers , lakes , and ordinary interior canals is declining . More efficient means of transportation , and often cheaper , are found in railroads and motor vehicles . Some of the greatest ports // of the world arc located on rivers , but generally not far from their mouths and at tidewater level . At any great distance from the coast river traffic tends to be of only local importance . Interior lakes and canals in like manner do not often form parts of a highway in national or world commerce , although in several instances they afford routes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been pointed out , are usually of insufficient depth or inadequate in extent for the operation of large-size vessels necessary for efficient and cheap transportation under modern commercial conditions . Important exceptions exist , however , to this general rule . The most important is the Great Lakes of North America . The traffic on these lakes is not only large , but of national and international significance . From the western end of Lake Superior to the eastern part of Lake Erie at Buffalo is a water route of nearly one thousand miles in length along which passes a large fraction of America 's export wheat and along part of which moves the iron ore that furnishes about one-third of the world 's pig iron and steel . Not many years ago lumber was also shipped in great quantities , but such shipments are now relatively small . Much of the traffic along the Great Lakes route is a one-way movement . Iron ore , which constitutes about half the total , is shipped east to furnaces on the southern shore of Lake Erie or east and south to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like manner is transported east to Buffalo where it is transshipped to trains for New York . There is a movement of coal in the reverse direction , however , but it is much less in amount than the eastward freight shipments just noted . Although the greater part of the freight carried on the Great Lakes consists of heavy and bulky commodities , packet freight transported is considerable . The passenger traffic is also moderately large . Aside from short local voyages about the larger cities in this region there is a growing tourist travel through the lakes . As a part of its transcontinental service the Canadian Pacific Railroad offers the passenger io6 OCEAN TRANSPORTATION at a slight additional cost the option of a boat trip on Lakes Huron and Superior in place of the rail journey for the corresponding distance . The Great Lakes by virtue of their depth , great size , and length of highway have many of the characteristics of the ocean and the larger inland seas . They accommodate vessels of considerable draught , and freight rates are much lower than is ordinarily possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and agricultural resources of the neighboring country accounts for the prominence of the Great Lakes as an important waterway . A very different type of inland water routes is that afforded by the lower Rhine River with its tributary streams and canals . As on the Great Lakes , traffic is heavy and enters largely into international trade . The route for the bulk of this freight , on the other hand , is comparatively short , and accommodates vessels of only light or moderate draught . The greater part of the traffic consists of coal and other bulky commodities capable of being readily carried in barges and flats . Through an elaborate canal system connections with remote parts of the interior are formed , but the most significant part of this river and canal system from a commercial standpoint is the lower Rhine itself and the tributaries of the region in that vicinity . In other parts of the world , especially those without adequate railroad facilities , rivers are still important lines of trade and communication between the coast and the interior . In most instances , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world is not large , and is often confined to one or a few commodities . Such rivers as the Nile , the Niger , and the Congo in Africa , the Yang tse Kiang in China , the Amazon and the La Plata ( including its branches ) in South America are trade routes between the interior of their several continents and coastal points , and afford the means by which certain commodities enter world markets . At one time the Amazon Valley furnished most of the raw material entering into the manufactured rubber consumed in the United States and Europe , and this material found its way to Para , the great export center , on // vessels plying the Amazon River . Much of the iron ore , used in Japanese furnaces comes from mines located on or near the Yangtse River not far from Hankow , China . Summary . Water routes , other than those on rivers and canals , are less clearly defined and less permanent than land routes . They can be better indicated on a map as broad ill-defined bands connecting important ports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flexible , often highways for one-way traffic in the case of triangular courses , and subject to no proprietary control by individual companies or by nations . Interior waterways , however , are generally definite lines of travel and commerce , and subject to the jurisdiction of the country or countries in which they are located . The routes followed by water carriers are determined mainly by the abundance of traffic offered in certain areas and the market possibilities of this traffic in overseas localities . The most important ocean route is the one connecting the North Atlantic seaports of the United States with those on or near the English Channel in Europe . Other important routes are those between the Pacific ports of the United States and Canada and the Asiatic ports of Kobe , Yokohama , and Shanghai ; between North Atlantic ports in Europe and the United States and terminals in India , the East Indies , and China and Japan ; between North Atlantic ports and those in southern Africa with extensions to Australia and New Zealand ; and between North Atlantic ports and the eastern coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and international significance may be mentioned those on the Great Lakes of North America and along the lower Rhine in Europe . // ARTIFICIAL WATERWAYS OR ROUTES Nature and divisions . Canals and canalized rivers arc . among the routes used , by water carriers . A canal is an artificial waterway generally built to develop or facilitate traffic . Although some are constructed for drainage or some other purpose , the canals discussed here are those built solely or primarily for transportation . These artificial waterways for the most part may be divided into two classes : ( I ) canals and canalized rivers which form part of an interior highway system , and ( 2 ) canals connecting or linking together two large bodies of water . The former serve practically the same ends as public roads and the road-beds of rail carriers . The country traversed by such waterways is generally an essential part of the area furnishing traffic or supplying a market . The latter simply enable a carrier on one body of water to reach another , or shorten the route between the two . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be relatively unimportant from a traffic or market point of view . In its original state this land is probably an obstacle to commerce . Canals forming part of an interior highway system are usually long and shallow ; those forming connecting links between large bodies of water , comparatively short and deep . These two types of waterways have an important economic difference : freight moving from an interior canal or river to a larger body of water like a bay , a gulf , or an ocean must generally be transshipped from a carrier adapted to shallow water to one suited for navigating deep seas . When freight is carried on an interoceanic canal or canal I09 z ro OCEAN TRANSPORTATION forming a connecting link between two large bodies of water there is no change of vessel in transit . In other words , an interoceanic canal is essentially a part of a deep waterway system , while an interior canal generally is not . Canals designed to extend ocean routes to inland ports ? sometimes called maritime canals ? may be considered a third class of artificial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of interior highway systems or connecting links between large bodies of water ; they have certain features , however , characteristic of the two main types named . They may so penetrate the coastal region of a country or a continent that an interior city becomes virtually a seaport . In any case , however , such canals are deep waterways and aim to bring the interior into immediate contact with the sea . Maritime canals are generally constructed either to maintain a city 's status as an ocean port , when this status is threatened by the increasing size of modern steamers or the silting of waterway connections , or to give an interior city the standing of a seaport when so located as to make such a project feasible . Modern canal-building may be said to date from the middle of the eighteenth century . At first it was intimately connected with the efforts to improve the means of land transportation when commerce was assuming its present form and proportions . Until the middle of the nineteenth century most of these waterways were projected and built as parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lakes were brought into close connection with one another . In large measure , the older public and turnpike roads gave way to a combined system of rivers and canals as trunk lines for land traffic over the more level parts of Europe and the United States . Before the canal-building period proper began , some important artificial waterways had been constructed in Europe . In Sweden a canal with locks , connecting Eskilstuna with Lake Malar , was completed in 16o6 . The Briare Canal in France was finished in 1642 , and by 1681 the great Languedoc Canal ( Canal du Midi ) , joining the Bay of Biscay and the Mediterranean Sea , was opened for traffic . ARTIFICIAL WATERWAYS OR ROUTES Canal-building in England is usually dated from the pas-sage of the first parliamentary act in 1759 authorizing the construction of a canal from Worsley to Manchester in re sponse to a petition of the Duke of Bridgewater , who desired a better outlet for the products of his Worsley collieries . The Bridgewater Canal , extending a distance of seven miles , was opened for use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of canal-building in Great Britain which continued prac tically to the middle of the following century . By 1830 some 3000 miles of canals had been constructed in England and Wales alone . Nearly all the important centers of trade and industry were connected with one another by a system of natural or artificial waterways . It is said that in 1838 no place south of the County of Durham was more than fifteen miles from a river , canal , or other means of water conveyance . ' In the United States the canal period began later than in Europe . A few early canals like the Dismal Swamp Canal , which was opened in 1794 , were projected and com pleted before the close of the eighteenth century . The building of such waterways on a large scale , however , came after the War of 1812 . The Erie Canal connecting Troy on the Hudson River and Tonawanda on Lake Erie was begun in 1817 and completed in 1825 . The signal success of this enterprise led to a large expenditure of money in artificial waterways in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic in the interior the canal in large measure supplanted the turnpike road . For a time it was the chief means of transportation and communication be tween the Atlantic Coast and the Mississippi Valley . The Ohio Canal between Cleveland on Lake Erie and Ports-mouth on the Ohio River connected the Mississippi River System and the Great Lakes ; and this canal was followed by others making similar connections . Along the eastern coast from New York Bay to Albemarle Sound a series of canals furnished an inside passage to vessels of small and moderate size between the northern and southern ports . The topography of the United States with its mountain II2 OCEAN TRANSPORTATION ranges running north and south across the principal routes of trade militated against the success of many of the canals built after the completion of the Erie . The superior efficiency of the railroad which was becoming apparent by the middle of the nineteenth century and the financial setbacks of 1837 and 1857 led to a gradual and general cessation of canal-building for an interior highway system . Before the outbreak of the Civil War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the interior , however , it continued to be advocated as a means of regulating freight rates on railroads , but the rail carrier was increasingly recognized as the principal transportation agent for domestic commerce . On continental Europe large amounts of capital were invested in canals during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries . Topographical conditions were more favorable to the development and maintenance of an elaborate canal system than in the United States or in Great Britain . Such advantageous topographical conditions , combined with political policy , especially in Germany , have made the canal and the canalized river important avenues of present-day trade in Europe . A traveler can visit many parts of central and eastern Europe without leaving a canal-boat . Even here , however , the relative importance of the canal has for several decades been declining ; and it is a question , despite many arguments still made in behalf of the further development of the present canal system of the continent , whether these artificial waterways can be adapted to the needs of presentday inland transportation . Interoceanic canals . During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large bodies of water were built . These were followed by others ? among them the Panama Canal ? during the first quarter of the present century . The primary purpose of these waterways was to afford a shorter , safer , or more economical passage between the bodies connected than Nature had provided . In 1855 a canal was completed around the rapids of the St. Mary 's River at the outlet of Lake Superior , offering // advantageous connections with Lake Huron . This canal has since been deepened and improved , and furthermore has been duplicated by a similar waterway around the other side of the rapids . The richness of the Lake Superior region in iron , copper , and other products essential to modern in industry , guarantees an enormous traffic through these canals . Although these waterways are ordinarily closed each year from three and a half to four months on account of the ice , during the remainder of the year the freight passing through them vastly exceeds that carried on the Suez or the Panama Canal . It took ten years to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promoted by the famous French engineer , Ferdi nand de Lesseps . A private company , the Suez Maritime Canal Company , constructed this waterway at an original cost of ? 16,632,953 ( about $81,000,000 ) . Since the origi nal completion of the canal , later improvements have brought the cost up to over $135,000,000 , it has been estimated . The Suez Canal was the first of the great interoceanic canals to be built ( using the term interoceanic in its more usual sense as applicable to oceans or the larger seas opening into oceans ) . ' Its length is 103 miles and connects the Mediterranean and Red Seas , with a minimum depth of 35 feet and bottom width of Io8 feet . It is a sea-level canal whose route follows low ground and certain natural or arti ficially-formed lakes . It is still the property of the original French company , although a large part of the stock ( not a majority of the total shares ) is owned by the British Govern ment . Essentially an international waterway , no discrimi nation exists in behalf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the net tonnages of vessels making use of the canal as net tonnage is computed by canal au thorities . ' From 1876 to the World War , the rates varied 1 14 OCEAN TRANSPORTATION from 13 francs ( $2.51 ) per net ton to 6.25 francs ( $1.2o6 ) . The latter figure was reached in January 1913 . During the World ' War the rate was again raised till it reached 8.5 francs ( $1.64 ) in July 1917 , where it has since remained . A reduction of 2.50 francs from the regular toll charge has been allowed on merchant vessels passing through the canal in ballast . A special passenger toll of 10 francs ( $1.93 ) per passenger with half rates for children is also imposed . The Kaiser Wilhelm or Kiel Canal is another interoceanic canal but much less important from a commercial standpoint than the one just described . It is a 61-mile connecting-link between Kiel Bay on the Baltic Sea and the mouth of the Elbe River as it opens into the North Sea . Construction was begun in 1887 and completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government in which naval objectives played a great part . While distances between German ports on the // Baltic and North fleas are shortened some 300 miles or more by the use of this waterway the saving in time and expense has not been sufficient to enable the German Government to charge tolls that would pay interest charges on the invest-ment . Although the present depth of the canal is 36 feet , vessels passing through it are generally of light draught . Over 70 per cent of these vessels are German . The Corinthian Canal in Greece was begun three years earlier than the Kiel Canal and was finished in 1893 . The original concession was obtained by a French company who transferred it in 1889 to a Greek company . The canal was built across the Isthmus of Corinth , a distance of four miles , to connect the Gulf of Corinth with the Gulf of Aegina . It was constructed to save the trip around Morea ( Pelopon-nesus ) and to shorten the distance between the Adriatic and Black Seas . The traffic passing through this waterway fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met serious financial difficulties . In 1907 a new corn-pany , the Nouvelle Societe du Canal de Corinthe , was formed by the old company 's bondholders , and took over the property at a foreclosure sale . In the years immediately preceding the outbreak of the World War traffic increased rapidly , but a heavy decline occurred in 1914 . The completion of the Panama Canal in 1914 marked the performance of one of the greatest engineering feats of history . " Since the golden age of discovery inaugurated by Columbus the quest for an all-waterway from Europe to ... the Far East , across the Atlantic and Pacific , has been a world obsession . The idea has possessed the minds of navi-gators , shippers , business men , admirals , and governments . Dozens of projects for the forcing of the passage have been advanced ; thousands of lives have been lost in the effort . " American interest in a route across the Isthmus goes back to the last decade of the eighteenth century when vessels flying the flag of the newly established government were conducting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islands , and with China , and when the American whaling industry was being extended into the Pacific Ocean . // This interest was further increased at the time of the war with Mexico , the annexation of California , and especially after the gold discoveries of 1848 and 1849 . In 1855 a railroad was completed across the Isthmus by a group of American capitalists . During the decade from 185o to 186o several surveys were made here and elsewhere with regard to the construction of a canal route . Before any serious attempt was made to build a canal the United States Government entered into several treaties with Great Britain , Mexico , New Granada , and certain Central American powers with a view to a guarantee of neutrality or equal use of interoceanic canals or a favored-nation treatment to the citizens of the United States whenever any interoceanic canals should be built connecting the Atlantic and the Pacific . From 1883 to 1889 a French company headed by Ferdinand de Lesseps , the builder of the Suez Canal , attempted to construct a sea-level canal across the Isthmus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the heavy mortality among the workers caused by the prevalence of disease in the canal region . In the meantime ( 1885 ? 1893 ) an American company endeavored to build a canal by way of Lake Nicaragua , but failed financially . Work was resumed on the Isthmus of Panama in 1894 by a reorganized company , but little progress was made . In 1901 the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty between Great Britain and the United States superseded the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty of 1850 . This treaty cleared the way of certain possible diplomatic difficulties for the United States in undertaking the task of building at the Isthmus an interoceanic canal . In 1902 the concession and the properties of the French Canal Company were purchased for $40,000,000 , and within the next two years cession of the canal zone was obtained from the newly formed Republic of Panama . This government was to receive from the United States $1o , - 000,000 and an annuity of $250,000 beginning with 1913 . Government vessels of Panama were to be allowed the free navigation of the canal . The United States obtained a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assume control of the sanitation of the cities of Colon and Panama . Construction was begun in a preliminary way in 1904. 1 // Failing to obtain satisfactory bids from contractors , the United States Government undertook the work directly . A lock canal rather than a sea-level canal was advocated by the majority of American engineers , and this plan was adopted by Congress . One of the first problems confronting the Government was the stamping out of yellow and malarial fevers , a work which was effectively done under the direction of William C. Gorgas . The Panama Canal extends from Cristobal on Limon Bay on the Caribbean side of the Isthmus to Balboa on the Bay of Panama , a distance of about 5o miles ( 43.84 nautical miles ) . The course of the canal , contrary to popular im-pression , is from northwest to southeast , the Pacific end of the waterway being about 20 miles east of the Atlantic end . Gatun Lake is part of the canal route . This body of water has an area of 164 square miles , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is from 85 to 87 feet above sea-level , and is reached from the Caribbean side through three sets of locks . The lake was created by constructing a dam nearly a mile and a half in length , thereby controlling the flow of the Chagres River , a tropical stream . Near the center of the dam a great concrete spillway discharges the surplus water of the lake into the lower channel of the Chagres River . Toward the southern end of the lake the passageway turns east through Gaillard Cut , nearly eight miles , thence through the Pedro Miguel Dam and lock where the vessel is lowered 301/3 feet to Miraflores Lake . After a passage of 1.4 miles two sets of locks afford the means of again reaching sea-level on the Pacific side of the canal . The minimum depth of the channel of the canal is 41 feet . Each of the lock chambers has a length of l000 feet , a width of 110 feet , and a minimum depth of 45 feet ? of sufficient size , therefore , to accommodate the largest vessel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through-out . The total cost of the canal was nearly $400,000,000 . In 1922 , for purposes of accounting , $112,618,082 of the total was written off to national defense ? or to those features representing the design of the canal and facilities that have // a military or naval value and would not have been included if the canal had none but commercial interests to serve . ' Of the remaining cost $235,684,662 represents investment in the canal proper ; $4,017,642 canal transit equipment ; and $29,136,620 auxiliary business enterprises . On the Panama Canal a toll of $1.20 per net vessel ton as computed by canal authorities is charged , but with the limitation that this charge must not exceed a statutory maximum of $1.25 per ton based upon net register tonnage as ascertained by the national measurement rules of the United States . Ves sels making the passage of the canal in ballast are charged 40 per cent less than vessels carrying freight or passengers . War vessels are required to pay 5o cents per ton of actual displacement . Inland maritime canals . Canals whose purpose is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nently in the trade of certain important European ports . Similar canals have been built elsewhere , but their commer cial significance has been less . While waterways of this character have been projected , and in some instances built throughout our canal-building period , the ones most impor tant for trade purposes have been constructed within the last fifty or sixty years . Two of these canals will be briefly described here . ( I ) The Amsterdam Canal , connecting Ymuiden on the North Sea and Amsterdam , was originally opened in 1876 . It had been constructed by a private company which received local and state aid . Later improvements involving heavier costs resulted in its purchase by the government . At first tolls were charged . These were reduced in 1885 , and abol ished in 1890 , on vessels going to Amsterdam . In 1893 all tolls were abolished . The length of the canal is 16.7 miles , and its bottom width 164 feet . The traffic on the Amster-dam Canal is large and intimately associated with the prosperity of Holland , and especially of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependent upon this artificial waterway . ( 2 ) The Manchester Ship Canal between Liverpool and // Manchester was completed in 1894 . In length it measures 35 / miles , in minimum depth , about 28 feet . Ships moving inland on this canal are raised by means of four locks to an elevation of 5 8 / feet above sea-level . To this canal Man chester owes its prominence as a seaport . The company which constructed and later improved the waterway is a semi-public corporation , in which the City of Manchester has a majority of the board of directors . As with the Amsterdam Canal , traffic on this waterway is heavy , and apparently justifies the outlay made in its building and later improvements ( about $85,000,000 ) . Classified with inland maritime canals should be certain canalized rivers on which are located important seaports . Such rivers as the Thames , the Weser , and the Elbe , have been canalized in order to maintain adequate connections between the sea and ports located some distance inland . With the increasing size and draught of modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on rivers a considerable distance inland ? have in many in-stances been displaced by others on or nearer the seacoast . Others have been obliged to expend large sums of money in keeping up an adequate channel to the sea . The inland maritime canals of the United States have not attained the commercial importance of the Amsterdam and Manchester Canals . There have been large projects looking toward the canalization of the entire upper St. Lawrence River and the connection of Lake Ontario with Lake Huron , whereby such cities as Chicago , Detroit , and even Duluth would virtually become seaports . The deepening of the channel of the Mississippi River so that ocean steamers might reach St. Louis has also been proposed . The mag nitude of such enterprises , however , has thus far prevented any serious attempt to make them realities . ' Some rivers on which important American ports are located are canalized to maintain proper and adequate sea connections . The Delaware , Columbia , and lower Willam ette Rivers may be said to be in part artificial waterways . // Economics of canal-building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from a social or public standpoint , is closely related to the increased traffic resulting from such construction . Such increased traffic must be real , and not a mere transfer from one route to another . In other words , the investment made in such a waterway should show a net gain to society in the volume of trade created by such an enterprise . Political and military considerations may indeed dictate the construction of a canal which , from a purely economic standpoint , would be regarded as unwise or unsound . Such building ? at least in the United States ? is rare , and the proposition for such an enterprise should be carefully scrutinized before it is adopted . The economic gains and losses resulting from canal construction in any state or country are hard to estimate , even approximately . The business success of canal operation , as shown in large revenues obtained from tolls on vessel or cargo tonnage , is some index of the value of an artificial waterway for those making use of it , but such success tells only part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a basis the social and economic worth of a canal like the one across the Isthmus of Panama . In cases where no tolls or only nominal tolls are charged , such a standard would have no meaning . Certain considerations of a general character may be stated . A canal of sufficient size and depth to accommodate vessels capable of competing with railroads and other land carriers necessitates a very large initial investment of capital . The building expense mounts rapidly and out of proportion to its depth and width ? a circumstance which tends to limit very materially the length of present-day canals and to locate them only in regions with great trade possibilities . It is true that in places furnishing a large amount of bulk freight portable in flats , barges , and other craft of comparatively light draught , canals and rivers with shallow water are still used . But even in such regions this kind of waterway is giving place to the railroad . In 1909 the Commissioner of Corporations stated that " about 4500 miles of canals had been constructed in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about $8o,00o,000 , have been abandoned . " The declining importance of canals as avenues of interior transportation is attributed " above all else to the funda mental inability of the ordinary type of towpath canal to meet modern conditions of transportation . They are thus unable to compete with railroads to any considerable extent . " 7 Of the canal mileage still in use in the United States only a small proportion has a traffic of more than local impor tance and a traffic adequate to the investment made in con struction . The cost of the Erie Canal and its branches with recent improvements is over $139,000,000 . The total freight carried in 1927 on this waterway and tributary di-visions was 2,047,774 short tons . In the years from 1866 to 189o , inclusive , the annual average was about 3,400,000 tons , and from 1890 to 1910 about 2,500,000 tons . Not-withstanding the decline shown by these figures , ' the Erie Canal is exceptional among the canals within the United States proper in the amount of traffic still transported on it . - Canals forming relatively short connecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a practical gain . The Sault Ste. Marie Canals involved a construction cost of about $14,000,000 . The traffic carried through these water-ways during the years 1913 to 1927 , inclusive , showed an annual range from 48,259,000 tons in 1921 to 91,888,000 tons in 1916 ? or a cargo tonnage averaging for the same period from 30 to 6o times as large as that carried on the Erie Canal , whose total construction cost was about ten times as great . ' The two great interoceanic canals ? Suez and Panama ? were built at great cost , but have justified the expenditures incurred by the number and tonnage of vessels making use of them and the distances saved between certain terminals . The Suez Canal was a striking success as a business propo sition , although there were many perplexing questions raised // early in its history regarding tolls , ship measurements , and the like . The traffic through the canal may be indicated by a table showing the number and net tonnage of steamers 1 ? making use of this waterway each decennial year since its construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ route may be illustrated by taking Liverpool and New York as typical Occidental ports and showing the mileage between them and certain prominent Oriental ports via the Canal and Cape of Good Hope routes as follows : // The Panama Canal was completed and first opened for traffic in the year which witnessed the outbreak of the World War . This event and the closing of the canal by slides from September 18 , 191 S , to April i S , 1916 , seriously interfered with the business and operating revenues of this enterprise during the first few years of its existence . A comparison - of operating expenses and revenues for the fiscal years 1926 and 1927 show the following : The figures for the years indicated show a considerable net revenue over current operating expenditures , and this revenue exceeds several times the interest on the present outstanding issues making up the Panama Canal Loan.11 Like the Suez Canal , the Panama Canal has enjoyed a marked increase in the number and tonnage of its vessels and also in their cargo tonnage . This increase is shown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the Panama Canal , as shown in the figures for vessel and cargo tonnage , is due to the increasing commerce between Atlantic and Pacific ports coupled with the great saving in distance and time in the use of this route instead of a passage around South America , South Africa , or through the Suez Canal . What the saving // Between ports located on the Atlantic coasts of the United States and Europe and those on the western coasts of North and South America the distances saved by the Panama Canal route show a general range from 1500 to nearly 9000 nautical miles . A similar , but somewhat less pronounced , saving is shown between North Atlantic ports and New Zealand . From Liverpool to Chinese , Japanese , and Philip-pine ports the distance is markedly less by the Suez than by // the Panama route , but from New York or New Orleans the difference favors the Panama Canal . With the develop-. ment of commerce in the Pacific Ocean , the Panama Canal route will grow in importance as it is now the only break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost to the Antarctic . It is not improbable that the future demands of trade will eventually make this canal a sea-level waterway and that it will be supplemented by another canal by way of Lake Nicaragua or some other feasible route . The increased use of interoceanic canals , and in some instances of inland maritime canals , contrasts in great degree with the diminishing importance of artificial waterways forming parts of an interior highway system . The latter , it has been mentioned , are often relatively long and comparatively shallow , and hence not suited to carriers of present-day proportions . The interoceanic canals , on the average , are shorter but much deeper and wider , and intended to accommodate vessels of large size . They are economical because of the time and distances saved in moving from one terminal to another . If they constituted in any instance a large proportion of an ocean route the expenditure involved would nullify their usefulness . This truth can be illustrated by taking the cost per mile of certain typical canals of the classes mentioned , indicating at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page 126 . ) Construction costs vary greatly with the engineering problems which must be met in each individual instance . A topography requiring the building of a lock canal and the raising of a vessel above the sea or ordinary water level , as in the Manchester , Panama , and Erie Canals , requires a larger expenditure than a waterway through practically level country . But it is also true that cost is very materially raised by increased depth and width . The high cost per mile of such waterways as the Suez , Manchester , and Panama Canals is in large part due to their width and depth . While canal construction cost per mile and railroad capitalization per mile , without any consideration of current operating expenditures , are not comparable items in estimating the relative expenses of canal and rail transportation , they do give a rough indication of the initial costs involved . // The net capitalization per mile of the railroads of the United States was in 1930 about $75,000 . The value of American railroads on the basis of the present tentative valuation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approximately the same per mile . The per mile cost of even the Berlin-Stettin waterway is greatly in excess of this figure , and that of the Erie with its modern improvements is between five and six times as much . The significance of the figures showing the initial capital expenditures required by the two forms of transportation is apparent . Summary . Some water carriers must use canals and canalized rivers as their routes . These artificial waterways may be divided into those which form parts of an interior highway system and those linking together large bodies of water . A third class is the so-called maritime canals which penetrate the coastal region of a continent in such a manner as to make an interior city a seaport . Modern canal-building may be said to date from the middle of the eighteenth century , although some important canals antedate this period . Down to the middle of the nineteenth century these artificial waterways were nearly all parts of an interior highway system , but in more recent times interoceanic canals have become increasingly important . Among the latter the // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are typical , and were built since the middle of last century . The feasibility of constructing an artificial waterway is closely related to the increased traffic which results from such construction and its proportion to the investment involved . Today a canal of sufficient size and depth to accommodate vessels capable of competing with railroads and other land carriers necessitates a very large initial investment of capital . This fact tends to limit very materially the length of present-day canals and make them highways of commercial impor tance only in regions of great trade possibilities . The arti ficial waterway as part of an interior highway system is apparently declining.in importance . The interoceanic canal on the other hand , adequate in width and depth and in saving in time and distance for the carriers making use of it , has become a vital link in several ocean routes . CH1PTER VIII PORTS OR WATER TERMINALS THE TERMINUS of a water route is a port . A port is a connecting link between water and land carriers or between the former and local producers and consumers on land . General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Latin porta which means gate . Generically , it signifies an entrance . In essence it is a gateway from the land to the sea or other waterway , or from the latter to the former . It is a place where freight and passengers carried by steamers , sailing vessels , or other water craft , can be landed or taken aboard . It also serves as a connecting link between two or more water routes . Geographically , a port is a point and not an extended coastline . Its area is restricted to a comparatively few miles of waterfront , generally located in some harbor , natural or artificial . Essentials of port development . It is characteristic of ports that they grow in accordance with the requirements of trade and along the lines of recognized traffic routes . No amount of mere local harbor convenience or suitability will originate or foster the growth of a port if the inducement of trade is lacking . There are many natural harbors , where ports could be established with requisite accommodations for ships and cargo , which have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the absence of favorable trade conditions . At the same time a good harbor is an important factor in port development . A well-sheltered inlet with water of sufficient depth for large water carriers will itself influence , and sometimes determine , the course of a trade route . I28 // Vessels need landing or anchoring-places , where some shelter is afforded from ocean storms , and where space and equipment can be Provided for the transfer of freight and passengers . A port , therefore , must have a favorable hinterland and a requisite harbor . The term hinterland , derived froth Germany , means land back of the port or coast . Used in.connection with water terminals it includes tributary areas of various kinds . These areas may be " contributary " or " distributary , " according as they feed or absorb water-borne traffic ? in other words , export or import . The hinterlands of the world 's leading ports are generally both " contributary " and " distributary . " There are some important ports which are primarily exporting or importing terminals . ' Where this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restricted in area and given over to the production of one or a few raw or crude products like coal , nitrates , raw cotton , and wheat , or larger in area and densely populated but having other trade outlets for its productive energies . In the former case the port is essentially an exporting terminal like Galveston , Texas , or Hampton Roads , Virginia . In the latter , which is much less common , the port receives much more freight than it contributes , the tributary areas finding a more convenient outlet for its products elsewhere . London is tending to become such a port . The harbor embraces the water area which accommodates the vessels of commerce while they are engaged in loading and unloading their traffic , making necessary repairs , and awaiting time of departure , together with the space available on or near the shore for the movement and storage of freight . Much of this latter space is devoted to wharves , beside which ocean vessels or subsidiary craft may land . Classification of ports . Ports may be classified according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general character of their harbors , and according to administration . A division according to traffic would segregate ports which are primarily passenger terminals from those which are chiefly freight . Such ports as Southampton , England , and Cherbourg , France , are terminals of great impor130 OCEAN TRANSPORTATION tance , but not because of the freight which passes through them . They are essentially places for the transfer of passengers moving between America and northwestern Europe . Travelers from the United States anxious to reach London speedily will disembark at Southampton and finish their journey by rail . The unloading of merchandise , however , at Southampton destined for London or its immediate vicinity is generally uneconomical . A freight vessel will proceed direct to London in order to avoid transshipment charges and an unnecessary rail haul which would be more expensive than similar transportation by water . Cherbourg , in like manner , is a convenient passenger port between the West and Paris and other great continental cities in northern Europe , but is too far from the leading industrial and population centers to be a great freight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade in raw materials and those with a more general freight tonnage also serves as a basis for grouping ports according to nature of traffic . Raw material ports , as has been indicated , are usually exporting terminals ? places where the outgoing freight greatly exceeds incoming traffic . Raw material production usually involves the utilization of labor which is small in proportion to output . As this output is often heavy and of comparatively low value relative to bulk , it moves to the nearest available harbor in order to save transportation costs . Hence it often reaches places on the seacoast where population is not large and sometimes even sparse . Galveston , the ports at the western end of Lake Superior ( Duluth , Superior , Cold Harbor , etc . ) , Hampton Roads ( with Norfolk and Newport News ) , and Antofagasta in Chile are terminals of this character . They differ in the nature of their traffic and in the equipment employed in handling it from ports whose traffic consists largely of products in a highly finished state and produced and consumed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London , Hamburg , Antwerp , and Rotterdam are characterized by a freight traffic consisting predominantly of manufactured products , and serve regions having a large and comparatively dense population . // The kind of waterway on which the port is situated determines the classification of harbors according to location and character . This classification would group such waterways into natural bays or inlets along the seacoasts , artificial bays or roadsteads , rivers flowing into the sea and of sufficient depth and volume to accommodate ocean carriers along part of their courses , and canals built for the purpose of connecting interior centers of population with the coast . In addition to these waterways are those serving the needs of internal commerce like lakes and rivers not connected with the seacoast ; or on which sea vessels do not ply . Ports located on such waterways sometimes have a heavy traffic but are not seaports . Their trade is likely to be wholly or mainly domestic . Natural bay ports may be illustrated by Liverpool , Southampton , Boston , San Francisco , and Rio Janeiro . Such ports are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anchorage of ocean vessels with one or more natural openings to the sea . Sometimes terminals of this character are located on bays or inlets which form parts of some larger bay or gulf . The Puget Sound ports like Seattle and Tacoma are situated on harbors opening into Puget Sound , itself an arm of the ocean . Artificial bays or roadsteads are created at government expense on the ocean shore where no natural harbors exist . Costly breakwaters are constructed to afford quiet water for landing or anchorage . The enclosed basins are usually dredged . Boulogne in France , Dover in England , and Los Angeles in California are ports located on such artificial harbors . River ports , which are at the same time seaports , are usually located near enough to the coast to be practically at sea level . Often the depth of the water in these highways is influenced by tidal changes . River ports include a large proportion of the world 's leading ocean terminals . London , Hamburg , Bremen , Rotterdam , and Antwerp are conspicuous examples . In the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oregon ) are river ports , and New York is partly a river and partly a natural harbor port . // The location of great seaports on rivers and often at a considerable distance from the sea had both historical and economic reasons . When these ports " were first founded , travel by land and sea was very dangerous . Depredations by pirates , marauders , and hostile tribes or nations were frequent . The early merchants therefore went as far up stream as the draft of their ships would permit , to get as far Away as possible from the sea with its lurking dangers . Also , inland commerce was carried on over navigable inland waterways which were safer and much cheaper avenues of transportation than the caravan routes on the high road . Therefore the towns of London , Bordeaux , Antwerp , Bremen , Cologne , Hamburg , and many more are situated at a point where ocean and river vessels could meet as far from the high seas as possible . Rome , Paris , Cologne , and others of these ports of the classic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have saved themselves from becoming inland cities by the development of the steam dredge to provide for the increased draft of steamships . " 1 Hamburg , one of the leading cities of the Hanseatic League , in order to avoid becoming an inland city , has annually in-creased its dredging operations to keep pace with increasing vessel drafts . At Blankenese , below Hamburg , this dredg ing has changed the depth of water during the past sixty years from one of six feet at low tide to forty feet at high tide . Canal ports are made such by virtue of artificial water-ways from the coast to interior cities or settlements . Man chester , England , and Houston , Texas , are essentially canal ports . Bruges , Belgium , which in the later medieval period was a leading terminal for the Venetian galleys on their annual voyages to northwest Europe and a great distributing center for their cargoes , is today a canal port . Its com merce , however , is now relatively small , and its chief attrac tion for foreigners is as a tourist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ located on or near the coast , there are many ports on inland lakes and // rivers . These terminals serve the needs of domestic trade ' , or trade between adjoining countries . Such ports as St. Louis , Louisville , Cincinnati , and Pittsburgh on the Missis sippi River and tributary streams , and Duluth , Chicago , Detroit , Cleveland , and Buffalo on the Great Lakes are es sentially terminals for an inland water-borne commerce . The trade and the location of such interior ports are differ ent in several respects from those of regular ocean terminals , and may therefore properly be grouped in a class by them-selves . The classification of ports with reference to administration groups these terminals according to their ownership and the authority exercised in their operations . Roughly speaking , ports according to this classification may be divided into four general groups : ( I ) public ports which are owned and administered directly by states or municipalities ; ( 2 ) semi-public ports , whose properties are owned in some instances by private individuals or companies and in others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control ob tains ; ( 3 ) public trust ports , which are owned and admin istered by non-salaried representatives of the municipality and commercial interests centered at these posts ; and ( 4 ) private ports which are owned and primarily controlled by private interests . ' The exercise of complete administrative authority at the various ports of the world is more complicated than this comparatively simple classification would imply . At all the leading ports some public authority is exercised with respect to certain operations . The collection of customs revenue , various shipping regulations , protective measures for safe-guarding the public health against the introduction of certain infectious diseases , harbor fortifications in the interest of the national defense , and the like , are all matters coming within the scope of public , and generally national , authority . In American ports the Federal Government through the Corps of Engineers of the War Department establishes official pier head lines beyond which wharves and other harbor structures may not be erected . The dredging and // maintenance of the harbor basin with its channel to the sea is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Policies with reference to the ownership and direct control of the area known as the waterfront are left to the determination of states and municipalities . The fourfold classification given above applies to this area . Leading European ports belong mainly to the first and third classes . On the continent public ownership and control largely obtain . In England the public trust type of port administration is characteristic of several of the larger ocean terminals . Liverpool , London , and Glasgow are administered by trusts of a public nature deriving their power from Parliament and composed of non-salaried representatives of various trade organizations . In the United States semi-public and private ports prevail . Several of the larger ports , including New York , belong to the former group , and the smaller water terminals are mainly owned by private concerns . There are , however , some public ports in this country , of which the two most conspicuous are New Orleans and San Francisco . In the Pacific northwest the ports of Seattle , Portland , and Gray 's Harbor are administered in part by port authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminals . Terminal equipment and facilities , as with railroads , are of supreme importance . The utilization of a harbor depends largely upon the means employed to maintain a proper depth of water , provisions for wharfage and dockage , and the various facilities used in the guidance of vessels to and from their landing or anchorage places . To describe in any detail even the most important of the various kinds of equipment used in port operations would necessitate much more space than can be given in a volume of this character . Some attention , however , should be paid to the principal kinds of port activities with the equipment and facilities used in order to appreciate their economic significance . At most of the leading ports of the world , a sheltered basin of sufficient area and depth necessitates considerable dredging . Similar dredging is required for the channel or channels connecting this basin with the sea . This operation // calls for the necessary dredging machinery and scows , and a towage service for the transportation of dredged material to the sea . This service , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely by the national government . Great expense is involved ? often beyond the means of local authorities . Some important dredging , however , is done under state and local supervision and at state and municipal expense . A port performs its principal service at a " waterfront " or harbor coastline furnished with the essentials for the loading or landing of traffic . The length of a port 's waterfront varies greatly , depending in part upon the volume and character of the products handled , and to a greater extent upon the organization and geographical position of the port . San Francisco with a waterfront of less than ten miles handles a traffic larger than several ports with waterfronts many times this length . It will thus be seen that the length of the waterfront is by no means a gauge of a terminal 's importance . The effective waterfront of a port is provided first of all with the necessary docks and wharves . While these terms are often used interchangeably , the word dock technically refers to the harbor space occupied by a vessel when loading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also employed to designate the space occupied when the hull is being repaired or put in condition for further service ? dry dock . The word wharf , on the other hand , refers to the structures at which water craft land and receive and deliver their cargoes . Wharves are of two kinds , quays and piers . The former consist of longitudinal shore bulkheads or structures roughly paralleling the shore line . In a sense they are broad extensions of the shore line for the purpose of affording a landing place of sufficient depth . Piers project from the water 's edge out into the harbor . They are generally long and relatively narrow structures , tending to be at right angles with the immediate shoreline . In the United States docks are generally open spaces alongside quays or between piers . In the latter case , they . are often called " slips , " especially where the space will accom136 OCEAN TRANSPORTATION modate only one vessel at a time . In Europe some of the docks at certain ports , including some of the most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with locks in order to preserve sufficient depth of water during low tide . The great difference in tide levels has necessitated the formation of such docks , especially in view of the great draft of the larger present-day ocean carriers . Some European ports similarly affected by great changes in water level have " tidal docks . " While these are without locks they have been excavated in the dry and have open entrances leading to navigable channels . Examples of ports having closed-in docks are London , Liverpool , and Bremerhaven . Hamburg , Glasgow , and Copenhagen have " tidal docks . " Wharves vary from simple and open landing places to elaborate covered structures with " sheds " or warehouses for the protection and storage of goods and highly intricate freight-handling facilities for the loading and unloading of cargoes and their transmission to and from these wharves . At the larger ports , wharves whose traffic consists mainly of packet freight , i.e. , freight packed in boxes or barrels or crated , are usually wholly or partially covered . The same is true of the larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted mainly to the handling of one or two products , the wharves are open or covered , depending upon the suitability of wharf structure for the prevailing kind of traffic . The freight-handling facilities provided at wharves , on board the vessels , and on floating harbor craft used in con nection with wharfage operations , consist of a great variety of machines and other equipment . They have been divided into two general types : those for handling miscellaneous cargoes , and those employed for special bulky commodities . ' Although this simple division serves to differentiate roughly the kinds of equipment used for handling certain products in bulk from those devoted to general cargoes , it gives little indication of the wide and fundamental differences between facilities employed in various phases of the same general operation and in handling products belonging to the same // general group . The donkey engine and hoisting gear on board vessel generally work in connection with various kinds of harbor and wharf machinery in the transfer of the same freight . The kind of equipment employed in the loading and unloading of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appliances used at the petroleum wharves along the Atlantic , Gulf , and Pacific coasts . The loading and unloading equipment of the leading ports today shows the tendency toward large-scale operation . Al-though much hand labor is employed , especially in Europe and still more in the Orient , the use of machinery is sup-planting that of hand tools and hand trucks . Movable cranes , movable steam derricks , platform conveyors , automatic lifts , locomotive wharf derricks , wire cables and chutes , and end less-chain arrangements have largely taken the place of the labor formerly engaged in transferring freight between wharf and vessel . Heavy and bulky products , especially where they constitute the greater part of the traffic , are handled by highly specialized equipment . Thus iron ore at the upper Lake ports is carried by train to long piers extend ing out into the water , unloaded into a series of pockets through openings in the bottom of the freight cars , and then transferred to the holds of vessels by means of chutes . At the lower Lake ports this same ore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loading and the unloading con sume a surprisingly short time . Coal at many points is loaded on barges or on coal boats directly from trains by the use of car-dumping machines and chutes at a cost of only a few cents per ton . Grain is handled in bulk at several ports by means of stationary or floating elevators . In a similar fashion sand , gravel , phosphate and fertilizer mate rials , and tropical fruits are transferred from land to water carrier , or vice versa , by the employment of highly special ized machines with great economy of time and expense which would otherwise accompany these operations . Identified with this loading and unloading service is the use of lighters . These are harbor craft employed where freight is not handled directly between vessels and wharves // or between interchanging water carriers . Sometimes a vessel anchors out in the open harbor when loading or discharging its cargo . Freight is conveyed to and from land by lighters or barges whose carrying capacity usually ranges from 200 to 800 tons . Even when a vessel docks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from various harbor points . Similar craft , called tenders , are used at certain ports in the conveyance of passengers to and from ocean liners . Another important part of a port 's equipment is a tug or towboat service for hauling or guiding vessels to and from their landing or anchorage places . Certain craft , like ordinary barges and scows , do not carry with them their means of propulsion . Sailing vessels which depend upon wind power generally need to be hauled into and out of harbor , especially if they are large in size and the harbor well sheltered . Steamers usually move into and out of port by their own power but often require the guidance of towboats in proceeding along the harbor channel and in docking . The towage service , it should be noted , includes more than simply harbor operations , as there is an appreciable amount of port-to-port hauling . For the most part , however , it is distinctly a terminal or harbor service . Port and terminal charges . Whenever a vessel enters and clears a port various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vessel , and others against its cargo . Certain charges are public , that is , imposed by the nation , the state , or the municipality ; others are strictly commercial . Great variation exists among ports in the amounts collected and the methods of imposition . They constitute , however , an important source of revenue out of which port activities are supported . Port or terminal charges may be grouped under the following heads : ( I ) local port charges ; ( 2 ) wharfage or tolls on cargo ; ( 3 ) pilotage ; ( 4 ) towage ; ( S ) labor involved in the loading and discharging of cargo ; and ( 6 ) miscellaneous charges . ( 1 ) The first include dockage charges , and occasionally other charges in the form of harbor fees and wharf or shed // dues . These tolls , wherever levied , are assessed against the vessel . Dockage is a charge for berthing at a wharf or pier or for coming within a slip , channel , basin , or canal . It usually varies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of days in dock , and general character of trade . Sometimes a vessel is also required to pay a general port warden 's harbor fee or various specific fees for surveys on cargoes , damaged goods , hull , sails , or rigging ; and for survey certificates . Wharf or shed charges to vessel are sometimes made in connection with wharf or pier landings . ( 2 ) The second group of charges is called wharfage , and is usually assessed against the cargo conveyed on , over , or through any wharf structure . These charges are imposed on both inward- and outward-moving freight . While they are assessed against cargo , they may be paid by the vessel 's company , in which case they will appear in the freight charge . Both dockage and wharfage are often partly or wholly absorbed in the case of through freight by rail and water where the owner of the waterfront and wharf is a railroad company . At Philadelphia , Boston , Baltimore , and Norfolk , terminal facilities furnished by railroads are practically free for such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ port facilities owned by public authority are leased to steamship lines or railroads under time contracts at agreed annual rentals , neither the vessels nor the cargoes of such concerns are subject to dockage or wharfage charges , these being included in rentals . This is notably the case with the greater part of the port facilities at New York . Where the municipal piers are not leased , a dockage charge is imposed . Wharfage charges against cargo are not collected at either privately owned or municipal wharves at New York . ( 3 ) - (4) Pilotage and towage , our third and fourth groups of terminal charges , are imposed , as the names indicate , for local services in connection with the movement of vessels into and out of and about harbor . The services of a pilot are required at American ports for foreign vessels and all sailing ships . Steamers engaged in the coastwise service may enter a port without taking a pilot , but the navi-                    @
