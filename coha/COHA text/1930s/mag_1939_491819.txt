I HAD returned from Europe in August , 1923 , and gone to Manchester , Vermont , to spend a few weeks . Robert Todd Lincoln had a country home there , where he spent many months each year in the latter part of his life . I had hardly reached the hotel when Horace G. Young , a great friend of Mr. Lincoln 's and a former bauker at Albany , New York , came to see me in a great state of excitement . " You must see Robert Lincoln at . once ! " he said . " You are the only person who has any influence with him . He is going to burn a lot of his father 's papers . For Gud 's sake , see him at once ! " It was too late to call on Lincoln that evening , but on the following morning I went to his house to pay my respects and have a chat after a considerable absence abroad , during which time President Harding had died and Calvin Coolidge had succeeded to the presidency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since the morning was chilly , reading a newspaper . After we had talked together for a time , on glanc-IL ing about the room I saw an old-fashioned trunk which was standing near one of the bookshelves . That looks as if you were going to travel , " I said . " Where is it to be this time ? " " Oh , no , " he said , " I am not going i anywhere . " " That trunk looks as if you were going somewhere , " I retorted . " What is that doing in the library ? " , " Well , " said Lincoln quietly , " it contains only some family papers which I am going to burn . " " What are you going to do ? " I said , in startled fashion . " Burn your family papers ! Why , Robert Lincoln , those papers do not belong to you . Your father rhas been the property of the nation for fifty years , and those papers belong to the nation . That you should destroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not do anything like that ! " There followed a very excited and indeed difficult conversation , extending over an hour . I drew a long breath , however , when , at its close , Lincoln said , " All right , but no one must see them while I live . " " Very well , " I said . " Then deposit them in the Library of Congress and fix it date before which they shall not be opened , " That he did . The letters , whatever they may be , are in the Library of Congress , where he had already deposited other family papers , and are not to be opened until twenty-one years after Robert Lincoln 's death . This means 1947 . Secrets in Ink W HY did Robert Lincoln want to burn these family letters ? It has Leen suggested that they contain evidence of the charge which has since been made , that Secretary Stanton conspired to wreck Abraham Lincoln 's policies and to bring about his murder . I can not believe that there is the slightest ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lettere contain records and evidence of various happenings in Abra%am Lincoln 's own life and family which it was just as well not to make public ; certainly not while his son was living . Robert Lincoln never made any definite statement of this Sort , but I draw the conclusion both from some things which he said and from some things which he left unsaid . In the very next year , my friend , Albert J. Beveridge , former senator from Indiana , who was writing his truly great life of Abraham Lincoln , heard that these letters had been sent to the Library of Congress , and he begged me to get permission from Robert Lincoln for him to read them in the preparation of his own work , I presented this request to Robert Lincoln under date of April 21 , 1924 : . . Albert Beveridge has asked me to inquire whether he might not have your permission to consult the Lincoln papers , both those in the Library of Congress and those in your own possession , in the course of the work upon which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . undertaken to continue the story of our constitutional history and development from the point where it broke off at the end of his four volumes of John Marshall , and to tell this story about the personality and history of President Lincoln . I have told Beveridge that I would be very glad to proffer this request of his and let him know what your answer might . he . Three days later he sent me this reply : Your letter or the 21st instant he s been duly received , and I was very glad to hear From you . I appreciate very mush your kind expressions regarding my health , and am glad to he able to say that I have passed a fairly comfortable winter , although I have lived quietly , seldom visiting the clubs and playing no golf whatsoever . The second paragraph of your letter can best lie answered , I believe , by enclosing to you herewith a copy of a letter written by me to Senator Beveridge under date of January 23 , 192.3 , earl I feel sure-that after you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter . The letter to Senator Beveridge under date of January 23.1923 , indicated that Beveridge had wade a direct lip-. peal to Lincoln , Tosotusa of thew papers some time before he asked for my aid in the matter . One of Robert Lincoln 's obsessions , which he never outgrew , was that he might have prevented the murder of his father by John Wilkes Booth . This WUR the wuy the matter ran in his mind . After being graduated from Harvard College , Robert Lincoln joined the Army and was on the staff of General Grant in Virginia . He was present when the surrender at Appomattox took place and was one of the group which witnessed tho historic happenings of April 9 , 1865 , with Gen. Robert E. Lee and Gen. ' Ulysses S. Grant as chief actors . At the first opportunity , Robert Lincoln returned to Washington with General Grant . They arrived on the morning of April fourteenth , and General Grant attended the Cabinet meeting on that day and gave a vivid and what must have been fascinating account of Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the Cabinet meeting , Robert Lincoln spent nearly two hours in conversation with his father , going over all the episodes in which he had taken part and explaining the various maneuvers of the armies and the characteristics of their commanding generals . At the end of the conversation , President Lincoln said that lie and Mrs. Lincoln were going that night to a. very interesting play , Our American Cousin , and hoped that he would come with them . Robert replied that he would like to do so , but was so tired and fatigued with his experiences in Virginia , and because of the rapid journey buck to Washington , that he would prefer simply to have a bath and go to sleep for many Lours . So the President excused him , and Robert was left in the White House when the party went to the theater . When Booth made his Fatal attack on the President at a few minutes after ten o'clock that same evening , Robert Lincoln was sitting en deshabille in the White House , talking with John Hay . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the house on Tenth Street where his fclher lay dying , and was there when the end came at 7:22 on the following morning . Robert 's argument was that had he gone to the theater with his father and mother , he , being the youngest member of the party , would have been in the bark of the box and , therefore , Booth would have had to deal with him before he could have shot the President . On this rather fantastic ground Robert Lincoln based his sad reflection that had he gone to see Our American Cousin , his great father 's life would not have come to so tragic an end . Robert . Lincoln had so great reverence for his father 's memory that he spent his life under what was substantially an inferiority compl6x . He used to say that he was not Robert Lincoln but Abraham Lincoln 's son . " No one wanted me for Secretary of War , " he remarked ; " they wanted Abraham Lincoln 's son . No one wanted me for minister to England ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for president of the Pullman Company ; they wanted Abraham Lincoln 's son . " This unfortunate mental attitude darkened much of Robert Lincoln 's life . He was shy and reserved , but full of human kindness and generous feeling which he often hesitated to reveal . The Little Mothers He was one of the company known as The Little Mothers , who spent a winter holiday each year at Augusta , Georgia . This group of interesting and important men , who were given their name in jest , since they were charged with trying to take care of the whole world , was drawn from a dozen or fifteen states , and included from time to time men who had been or were to be President of the United States , . as well as others prominent in the public and intellectual life of the nation . With this group Robert Lincoln was very much at home , and seemed brighter and less restrained than in any other relationship . He told interesting and often amusing stories of his experiences , particularly while in the Cabinet and while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golf game was not of the best , but it was quite good enough to enable him to participate with mush pleasure in the games and contests which were held at Augusta , Georgia , during the month of March each year . Three months after returning from one of these Augusta holidays , Mr. Lincoln wrote me this letter : June 16 , 1013 . Your train is due ( R. R. time ) to pass a small station , Sunderland , at 005 A.M. Not far beyond it if you will look to the left in the valley , you can see on a hillside a bright spot in the trees which is the dome of my observatory . From it I look nightly into a universe wherein there is no Referendum or Recall and only one body which is at once powerful and incalculably erratic , and though still influential upon the Tides , is said to be dead . I refer only to the Moon . Please with Mr. Vail come to us and look at it and have a brief relaxation from political grief . Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Robert Lincoln 's personality was that made in connection with the sharp controversy which developed as to which statue of his father was to be erected in London , as a gift of American citizens , to mark the one-hundredth anniversary of the peace between Great Britain and the United States established at the end of the War of 1812 . A representative committee of Americans had been formed to celebrate this anniversary in various ways . but their activity was brought to an end by the outbreak of the great war on July 28 , 1914 . The proposal was that this should be a copy of the statue by SaintGaudens which stands in Lincoln Park in Chicago . It proved to be impossible , however , to secure the necessary funds for this purpose . A War of Words Just about this time , Charles P. Taft . of Cincinnati , Ohio , half brother of President Taft , had by benefaction made possible the erection in Cincinnati of a new and very novel statue of Abraham Lincoln by George Grey Barnard . On being appealed to by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the anniversary celebration , Taft generously offered to meet the cost of a copy of the Barnard statue to be set up in London . Without very much formality , the committee , or some members of it , offered this statue to the public authorities in London , by whom it was accepted . As soon as this became known in the United States , a storm broke out which lasted for months . The Art World , in its issues for June , August and October , 1917 , and January and March , 1918 , contained correspondence and editorials which were marked by most savage criticism , attacking the proposal to set up the Barnard statue in London . This statue was attacked not only on artistic grounds but for lack of historical accuracy . The protests included the full text of a resolution adopted by the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects on February 18 , 1918 , to the effect that " there is ample and conclusive evidence that this statue does not adequately or correctly represent the personality of that great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including this body , feel that the artistic and sculptural value of this work is open to question " and was , therefore , " an unsuitable and improper representation of Abraham Lincoln . " This resolution was given the widest possible publicity . The tight waged fast and furious and , of course , came to the attention of Robert Lincoln . He himself was deeply moved by what he regarded as a tragic attack on his father 's memory , and addressed a very vigorous letter on the subject to former President Taft under date of March 22 , 1917 . Many of his friends , including Joseph H. Choate , Henry Cabot Lodge , Henry Watterson and Cyrus Townsend Brady , joined in violent protest against sending the Barnard statue to London . The situation was most embarrassing , because the Barnard statue had been tendered from the United States and , at least informally , had been accepted by representatives of the British Government . Robert Lincoln then set about making it possible to offer a copy of the Saint-Gaudens statue instead of the Barnard statue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and stated that he had deposited 325 , - 000 with J. P. Morgan and Company , which I was at liberty to use in having made and shipped to London a copy of the Saint-Gaudens statue , provided we could secure its substitution for that by Barnard . There followed long months of correspondence and negotiation . The great war was still raging , and men 's minds in England were not chiefly concerned with memorial statues . However , the trustees of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace took hold of the matter , and through their representatives and correspondents in Great Britain , . especially Lord Weardale , carried on an organized and what proved to be effective movement to secure the acceptqnce of the Saint-Gaudens statue instead of that by Barnard . Finally , this was accomplished and the Saint-G audens statue was set up in the Canning Enclosure facing the north door of Westminster Abbey and looking out toward the Houses of Parliament and the great group of statues of noteworthy English statesmen which surround that noble building . This statue was offered to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behalf of the American people , and finally accepted by them early in December , 1913 . By December , 1919 , the Saint-Gaudens statue , which had been transported to England by the Cunard Steamship Company without charge July 28 , 1920 . Elihu Root , then president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , made the formal presentation . Lord Bryce presided and Lloyd George , then Prime Minister , accepted the statue on behalf of the British people . The actual unveiling was done by the Duke of Connaught . In his brief speech Lloyd George said , " The qualities that enabled the American nation to bring forth , to discern , to appreciate , and to follow as leaders such men , are needed now more than ever in the settlement of the world .... This torn and bleeding earth is calling today for the help of the America of Abraham Lincoln . " Eventually a place for the Barnard statue was found at Manchester . The cost of making , shipping and installing the Saint-Gaudens statue had been met by the Carnegie Endowment for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great American statesman of the Civil War period should always stand at a center point in London to mark the underlying principles and ideals that are common to the English-speaking peoples . When I wrote to Mr. Lincoln , telling him what had happened and hinting that we should not need to make use of ? the $25,000 which he had deposited with J. P. Morgan and Company unless , perchance , we should have to draw upon that fund to meet the cost of the pedestal and sundry incidental expenses , ho wrote me , under date of January 8 , 1919 : I appreciate very greatly your note about the finances ; I assure you that I am not in the slightest way disturbed about that element . I have assumed that Mr. Morgan will , through an account in his house , handle the disbursements , and in respect to that , ho and 1 had an interchange of notes in December . In consequence of your mention of the pedestal &c.,; I have written him an additional note in regard to all expenses outside the contract which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from you that any payments are to bo made , ho will cause them to be cared for . From being a very great trouble and anxiety to me , the London statue affair has been transformed into a pleasure by the work of friends inspired by feelings for which my filial gratitude can not find adequate expression . Son 's Gratitude After the ceremony of unveiling had been completed , I wrote to hire on December 4 , 1920 : Even at this late day let - me congratulate you most heartily upon the successful carrying out of the program to place the St.-Gaudens statue of your father upon the Westminster site designated by the British Government . I have caused to be sent to you the recent publication of our Association for International Conciliation . giving a photograph of the statue in situ , and a record of the speeches by Lord Bryce , Root and Lloyd George , together with an appreciation by Mrs. Herbert . Adams and an introduction by Cass Gilbert . We can place at your disposal as many copies as you may wish of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send copies to any addresses that you may think it worth while to furnish . Since all expenses in the matter have been met , you are free to release the fund which you placed with your bankers to guarantee the possibility of this undertaking , should the other means fail . To this letter Lincoln replied , under date of December 17 , 1920 : By some mishap the pamphlet publication of the American Association for International Conciliation giving the photograph of the statue of my father in the Canning Enclosure , Westminster , and the addresses made at the unveiling and the articles of Cass Gilbert , Mrs. Herbert Adams and J. St. Loe Strachey , was delayed ten days in coming and this partly accounts for my delay in acknowledging your letter . but not entirely . I am simply overwhelmed by my emotions in trying to express my gratitude to you for the result of your great work in placing in Westminster the Saint-Gaudens statue as an American public gift , and so excluding the proposed Monstrosity . I am more than ever proud of a father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his memory from an enduring outrage , and in whose honor their action was so eloquently sustained by Mr. Root and his distinguished colleagues at the presentation ceremonial . I thank you very much for your kind proffer of copies of the pamphlet and will be glad to have a dozen of them . Now I come to an embarrassment which is of my own creation ; I think that you and Mr. Morgan understood that I expected that the guaranty fund would be drawn upon ( with the knowledge of yourself and him only ) and I was quite surprised to hear from you about a year ago ( I can not now lay my hand on your letter ) that the cost of making the statue had been fully subscribed and suggesting , as I recall , that the guaranty should be made to cover the expense of packing and shipping and of Hotting up the statue . To THE SATURDAY this I was very glad to assent , but I now fear that I failed to express myself properly , as you toll me that the fund is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was better that the memorial should be essentially not a simple filial act of my own , 1 hoped and expected that I should have some private practical part in it . I should be very glad , if it is not really too late , that this might be arranged . In any case I can only suggest that you advise Mr. Morgan , who holds the fund as Trustee , of the situation and he will riot accordingly . Thus ended in most satisfactory fashion an episode which had made Robert Lincoln desperately unhappy for the greater part of four years . It was not long before another suggestion was made which both interested and disturbed him . This came from an editorial written by Alfred Holman , who was the editor of the Snn Francisco Argonaut , which was published in the Argonaut under the title , The Tomb of Lincoln . Mr. Holman 's editorial made the suggestion that Lincoln 's remains should be taken from Springfield , Illinois , to Washington , D. C. , and buried permanently at the newly planned Lincoln Memorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wrote me this letter on Novem.ber 15 , 1922 : I am leaving for Washington tomorrow and will briefly give you my ideas on the subject of the suggestion of Mr. Alfred Holman , which I have read with a great deal of interest and I can quite understand the value of his suggestion , but necessarily I must consider the idea of changing the burial place of my father from Springfield , Illinois , to Washington City from a very different viewpoint than that of Mr. Holman . Of course 1 could write at length upon the subject , but I think it best to do so only briefly . I will ask you , if it is convenient to do so , to look in my father 's life by Nicolay and Hay and to read again at Volume Ill , page 2il. my father 's farewell address upon leaving Springfield . Than in Volume X , at Page 324 on the last page , is an indication of the monument atSpringfield in which my father is buried . At the time there was no serious thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work of Larkin G. Mead , an American sculptor who had his home in Vermont and who was , in his time , of very considerable distinction , and I must say that I think that Mr. Holman 's severe words in speaking of it are unduly strong . In later years some structural defects appeared and the State of Illinois appropriated a very largo sum of money to rectify them . It is a structure in which the State has taken a great interest in every way . It has a resident custodian who is an officer of the State . Within it are entombed the bodies of ray father and my mother and sax only son , and it is arranged that my wife and myself shall be entombed there . I should myself oppose any change . I am entirely in agreement with Mr. Holman in his admiration of the Lincoln Memorial building at Washington . This creation is due to the work of an old friend of my father , Senator Cullom , and he never had any idea of its taking the place us a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if alive , be opposed to it as I should be . I will not attempt to say anything more and very much hope that the project of Mr. Holman be not further pressed or made a matter of public discussion , certainly at least in my lifetime . The last public appearance of Robert Lincoln that is known to me was when , a short time before his death in 1926 , he went to the railway station at Manchester , Vermont , to greet President Coolidge , whose northbound train stopped there for a few moments , Lincoln and the President exchanged greetings and had a few minutes ' private conversation .
