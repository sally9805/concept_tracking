suppose it is because I would not mind getting shot myself , but I could never endure a trap . " They sat on the ferny slope above the race . The massy firs soared above them . The air was full of the splash and coolness of the moving water , the scent of evergreens , mushrooms . The day was very still and warm . Alan spoke several times again of the fawn . It had smelt of leaf-mould and " newness . " It had soft eyes like a woman . Surely by now it had found its mother . Tomorrow he 'd look about and make sure , for it was better to hit it on the head ( and eat it ) than leave it to starve in the woods . Dilly stretched out her considerable length , her hands under her head . Her eyes closed . Perhaps she slept . She opened her eyes suddenly and sat up . The afternoon was drawing to a close . Alan was not about . Mrs. Milroy stood out from under the shadow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Evidently she was preparing to leave . The Indian basket was at her feet . She stood very straight and still looking about her as though determined to learn this woodsy scene beyond any possibility of forgetfulness . She studied the pattern of the firs and the purple shadows that they cast . She looked slowly at the bit of emerald moss where , hours before , a red salamander ( the veritable godling of the forest ) had been sunning . Now he was gone , but she would remember him . She stared downstream where rock maples burned , then at Alan 's cabin and the rotted wheel . Everything she studied upon as though to memorize . Her face was completely relaxed . Like the faces of most people over thirty , when relaxed it was sad . It was sad and resigned , as though she said farewell to all she loved . In her hand was the square of black silk which she had worn over her head . She held it before her in both hands and foldedp151it to a triangle . Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperate resignation she tied it in place . The young girl lay awake a long time on this her second night . Once she heard Mrs. Milroy ( always a troubled sleeper ) slip down the stairs . Dilly slept , and when she awoke the day was breaking and she heard the black cock crow . She heard a shuffling of slippers on the stairway . Phillis was up early . . . or Mrs. Milroy had come back late . PHILLIS indeed had changed in Dilly 's absence . She had stolen spoons and had been roundly scolded for it . She had resented Mrs. Milroy 's threats to sell her to the South , where slaves were not supposed to be as well treated as in New England . Now she would stick out her great lower lip over the merest trifles . Her manner was not so respectful , and when she was called , she did not obey immediately , happy as a dog to hear its name on its master 's tongue . Sometimes she 'd come muttering a little , said some folks thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had always been in the habit of bidding her in one breath to brush her hair , fetch her knitting , make tea , get the chickens out of the garden , and untangle her embroidery crewels . Never before had Phillis shown any resentment . It was a little as if she knew something about Mrs. Milroy . But never had Mrs. Milroy been so easy a mistress . She was indifferent to all the finicky details of housekeeping that had once been the end-all of her life . That neither " Mr. Milroy 's " candlesticks nor " my " candlesticks were as well polishedas formerly did not worry her . Almost were they merely candlesticks . The windowpanes looked a little foggy.  |p152She  spent hours at her writing desk . And some of these letters went to the general stationed outside New York . 44Now and then Dilly and Morganna walked over to Job 's Folly . Alan was always home , seemingly expecting them . The hours these three spent together were golden hours , unruffled by suspicion , disappointment or petulance . Morganna and Alan were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-formed worries . Alan ( as far as Dilly knew ) never came to Milroy Mansion . He said he was working hard on his fence , but Dilly did not see it . One day Dilly stopped at the West Indy shop and Catsey Millis rapped on the windowpane and bade her enter the house . She said that unless Miss Lavander would sit and drink tea with her she 'd be forced to drink alone . This she averred was bad for digestion . Her eyes  --  peaking , curious eyes  --  were alight . She came out at last with what was on her mind . And for once it did not concern Claude . Seems Frost 's cousin was maidservant to the Millises . And same cousin , said Frost was much perturbed because one of his ladies of late was slyly meeting her lover in his most Christian coach house  --  in fact in the yellow-bodied coach . Every morning when he arrived at work ( he slept at home ) he would open the coach door and go sniff , sniff ( Catsey imitated him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once he had found a lawn kerchief . Another time a handkerchief . Dilly 's face reddened until her eyebrows whitened . She tried to speak , but Catsey interrupted with a laugh . " Nay , now I have my answer . And I promise you ' t is not the one I might wish ! For I see it is you , Miss Lavander , who rendezvous in that coach ( of course I know Mr. Brann is still about ) , and I had hoped it was Madame . She has always been so high above the rest of us mortals I 'd lovep153to see her come a fall . Oh , what a spectacle ! Madame all mixed up with Cupid ! But she has n't it in her . Well  --  at least I promise you your secret is safe with me . And truth to tell , what I have seen of Mr. Brann I like right well . I 'd much rather have him soberly married to a young miss like yourself than going down to death and ruin with Morganna Milroy . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who as much as laid a hand upon his wife . And I believe she would as well . " So gossip was gathering . False gossip indeed , but what might it not lead to ? When alone , Dilly fretted , but when actually with Alan and Morganna she was conscious only of an innocent assumption that all was well.  |p154Now  THE skeletons of the trees emerged from theirgaudy trappings . They stood bare at last to thewhistling winds . Now were heavy frosts , white lawns , and the foreboding of winter . Mrs. Milroy and Dilly worked upon the flowerbed , cutting back roses , pulling up blackened slimy stalks of mignonette and marigold , tying up vines , dividing clumps of phlox and larkspur , raking leaves into heaps to burn . " Far sounds have come close , " said Dilly , " and that means rain tonight . Wind too . The clouds are racing , far above , although ' t is quiet here below . " Mrs. Milroy also leaned upon her rake . " I hear people yelling upon the common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the world 's like crystal . " " I hear the wild geese . . . " " But what a commotion upon the common ! Well , if you are right , Dilly , and this clarity means rain , I hope it will not come until after Frost has burned my leaf piles . I always do it after dark , so I can see as well as smell . " The leaves had been raked out of the garden and into the gutter before the house . The stately gate in the picket fence was open . " Well . . . we 've worked overlong . And I grow weary . We must wash and dress ourselves . Sometimes when I do such simple work I half envy . . . But hark ! They are ringing the meetinghouse bell . "  |p155Cling  cling . Clinkerty clong-clong . A jangle of sweet sound with neither rhyme nor reason to it . " Can it be , " asked Dilly , " a call to fire ? " " No . . . some news has come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They beat thus when General Burgoyne surrendered . And when the French lords landed at Newport . " The ancient cannon  --  too weak for military use  --  went off with a bang . There was a pause and then again bang-bang . " It is the signal . We are all supposed to get to the common . " She shrugged , " Not I. " " Lord Cornwallis ? " Dilly suggested . " Yes  --  I believe so . Well  --  England will never send another army over here . This is the end . " Ever since Dilly had been old enough to take interest in things outside herself this war had been going on . Peace ? What would peace seem like ? She had no conception . A neighbour , who never stopped for a word with Mrs. Milroy , came clumping down the road away from the common on an old horse . " Just goin ' back to git the old woman an ' the gals , " he shouted . " We 've won . Everybody git to the common . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his speech . Morganna was frowning thoughtfully . " Did n't he say something about General Milroy ? " " I could n't hear most of what he said . " " Well  --  he rode right through the middle of one of my leaf piles . Do set it to right . I believe I 'll go in now . . . I think I 'm coming down with a headache . " The din on the common increased . Drums rolled . Fifes piped a martial air . Shots were fired and the bell from the steeple poured forth its good tidings . By now the professional bell ringer had been located . " What day is today ? "  | " The twenty-sixth of October . " " It must have happened over a week ago . I know what the mob will do . Everybody get drunk . ' Twill be a rowdy night . But we will go early to our beds . Oh , I can thank God ' t is over . Once more there will be neither patriot nor Tory . Alan says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the very one . . . my father gave to me at Hopkinton . " More people were hurrying in from outlying districts . A dirty bearded oldster stopped to fire his flintlock . " What a fool ! If they all go on shooting and drinking , someone 's bound to be killed tonight ! " She seemed fascinated by the spectacle and she still stood outside her gate , rake in hand . A mounted man surrounded by a bevy of eight or ten approachedfrom the village . " Sheriff Parmenter , " said Morganna with scorn . " What 's he doing here ? He ought to stay about the common  --  if they are going to have a bonfire  --  and protect folks ' property  --  at least their fences and privies . Well  --  I shall go in now  --  " " Madame , madame , " called a woman 's voice , a voice as thick and rich as the bubbling of a suet pudding . " Do n't lock your gate . " Mrs. Milroy said , " Well ? " and waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was Mollie Magee , the village washerwoman . She was a black-haired strappingcreature with coarse handsome features and fine teeth , despite her forty years . In normal life she was only known as a powerful worker and the indolent mother of many , but tip the social pattern ever so little and Mollie by sheer strength of personality was apt to rise to the top . " Lady , " said Mollie , and there was a curious enticement in the soft rough voice , " we 've come to axe your permission ... " " Yes , Mollie ? "  | " The folk on the common . . . we 've got together and voted to build an elegy . " " She means effigy , ' " Mr. Parmenter put in good-naturedly . " An F.G . then  --  of King George and hang him on a gallows . And they voted me the head of the F.G . committee . We 'd take it most kindly if you 'd lend us your bay coach horse , ma'am . We wan ' ter ride him round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old-fashioned hanging you need a horse . " Morganna stiffened . " May I ask you to give- up any such idea ? Last time you borrowed ' my horse he was returned mutilated . Think you I will lend again ? " " Now , Mrs. Milroy , " put in the sheriff , " that 's why I come along  --  and I ca n't stay but a moment . I think these good people deserve a celebration , but I want to keep order . I told Mollie she was to ask politely and I thought you 'd agree . If you do n't , they may steal him off you and he 'll come to more harm . " Mrs. Milroy turned to Dilly . " Please to go to the stable and fetch out my poor old horse . " But Dilly lingered . She did not want to leave Mrs. Milroy alone even with the kind sheriff . The others headed for the barn . Sheriff Parmenter bent in his saddle and said in a low voice , " Mrs. Milroy  --  as an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come to the common  --  but for a few moments . Mr. Merrifield has been persuaded to open the meetinghouse for thanksgiving . I can assure you . . . " " Thank you . I will stay here . " " Mrs. Milroy . . . " " I will stay here ! " " Mrs. Milroy . . . it was voted that every person suspected of being a Tory at heart must sooner or later tonight drink to our victory . I think if you would drink with me  --  nowtheywould be satisfied and molest you no more . " " ' T is the duty of the sheriff to see I am not molested . " " But I 'm part of the delegation riding down Springfield Road to meet General Milroy . We may not be back for some hours . " " General Milroy ! " " You had not heard ? " " No . " " It was a rider of his who came racing into town with news ' of Yorktown , and he requested a chaise be sent back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit a horse . So it was voted a dozen of us set out to escort him . " " Someone is sick . . . Mr. Parmenter , who is sick ? " He felt the tension of her voice . Read fear where a more astute man might have read hope . " Do n't you go worrying about the general . If it had been he or Claude the rider would have said so . " " How sick , " she said slowly , " is the sick man ? " " Sick close to death . " " If it were a common soldier , they 'd leave him behind with a farmer 's wife . . . . Something sudden , you said . Mr. Parmenter . . . General Milroy 's father died of an apoplexy at about the same age . " Her hands twisted . " There , there , ma'am , do n't you go worrying over those Milroy men . " Mrs. Milroy 's eyes fell upon Dilly . The others had all gone to the barn . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stormed . " Why are you so tardy ? " And then in a low voice to the sheriff , " Will they try to make all of us who have ever entertained English sympathies . . . " Dilly heard no more , but she knew ( and hoped Parmenter did not ) that she had Alan Brann in mind . DILLY found the motley group , not in the barn , but in the coach house . It was a legend in Fayrely how long ago Arn Milroy and his proud new wife had arrived from Boston in a four-horse coach . Not once from that day to this had the coach been taken from its shelter . Now was a good chance to see if it were indeed as magnificent as legend claimed . It was . " I remember the day , " a woman was saying . " I had just washed Ruth 's diapers and hung ' em up  --  she 's six now  --  say five years back . And , my Lord ! if I did n't see four strappingbays acoming up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold swaying behind . The coachman cracked his whip and ordered all us common folk to get out of the way . But there inside was Arn Milroy laughing and waving at us and as the coach tore past he stuck out his head and yelled , Meet my wife . ' They was gone then . Often I 've wondered if I had n't dreamt it . " Mollie 's head and shoulders were inside the coach . Nothing was visible except her formidable haunches  --  Dilly addressed these haunches in tones somewhat like Mrs. Milroy 's . " The horse is kept in a stall , Mrs. Magee  --  not inside the coach . " Slowly the woman pulled out her upper half . She was undisturbed by the implied reproof . Her black rogue 's eye was twinkling . " Sniff , sniff , " she said with meaning . " I smell the blood of an Englishman . " So Frost 's stories had spread through the village . " Dearie , that 's what the ogre said just before he ate the young man . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd take it very kind if he 'd join us tonight . Where is he ? Up at Job 's Folly or down here hid away in the house ? Oh , do n't bother to say if you do n't want to ! We 'll find him , dearie , just as soon as we want him . And just so nobody gets mad we 'll have fun . Say , we 've had fun with those Sparhawk Girls already ! You know everybody ever suspected with treason'gainst his country has to drink to our victory tonight . Jed 's in charge of that part of the celebration . You should have seen those old maids astanding on their front stoop drinking the health of the American republic in bad elderberry ' wine ( practically vinegar ) with a little ipecac added . We 've mixed up a gallon of the stuff . Make a horse throw up . They got it down all right , but it would n't stay . Miss Stephanie puked all over the front of her best bodice . We laughed fit to kill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink . And Mrs. Milroy , maybe , and that Alan Brann . Good fer folks with plenty of spleen in ' em to puke . " As she talked , Dilly led the way to the barn . When they got to the gate once more Mr. Parmenter was gone . Mrs. Milroy stood alone . She never glanced at Mollie , proudly astride the bay horse . She whispered to Dilly , " I want you to go with them . I 'm afraid they may hurt Alan Brann . Mr. Parmenter said . . . " Dilly quickly told her of Mollie 's threats . In spite of the honour in which they held General Milroy they might come back for her . Make her drink the emetic " Never ! There 's not one person in Fayrely can stand up against me . But if you hear any threats against Alan , come back and tell me . I 'm not sure they know where he is . " She promised and quickly overtook the others . Mollie greeted her as a new recruit . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like a good republic oughter have . Now Freddie Walsh , the carpenter , he 's chairman of the gallows . " " Gallows ? " " Why , to hang the F.G . on . Mr. Merrifield 's head of religiousexercises , and Ensign Pears of getting out the militiamen , and making a good show when the general comes . Jed 's appointed to make folks give us enough liquor to make things go smooth and Pip 's in charge of the bonfire , and Jed ( once more ) of making loyalists drink . Mr. ' Parmenter said all this was proper . Of course he thought it was good wine we offered the Sparhawk Girls . He thought they just puked because they was natural pukers . Now I 'll make you chairman of my subcommitteeon getting a head for our King George . We got an elegant scarecrow for a body and a yellow weskit , and Mr. Merrifield gived us a purple plush coat that ai n't any good no more . We got the wig Sam Wright 's grandfer died in , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think . . . " Dilly , walking beside the horse , remembered childish harvest frolics . " How would a pumpkin do ? With a face cut on ? I could cut a face ! " " Why , that would do fine . . . . We 'll get that German bastardfixed up fit to kill . And I 've been studying on how we can make him tight enough on the horse so he wo n't roll off when we parade him and loose enough so he 'll come off under the gallows . " " We could weight his feet , perhaps . " " Say , between us , you and me , we 'll make an F.G . . . . " the warm muddy voice rolled on and carried Dilly with it . Everyone seemed good-natured and happy . This was fun.  |p162HUNDREDS  were gathered upon the common , all waiting for the meetinghouse to be opened . The General Wolfe was doing a bustling trade and Mr. Tarbell had promised to give away to the poorer people exactly as much liquor as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ militia were drawn up .. Tar barrels and fence rails were being carried to the bonfire which would not be lit until dark . Cheers greeted a privy that . was recognized as the Millises ' , and another cheer the Sparhawk , Girls ' chicken coops . These folk and Mrs. Milroy were the only suspected Tories . Dilly did not hear Alan Brann mentionedagain . Mollie had summoned the children of Fayrely to bring jacko ' - lanternsto Dilly and soon they began to come by tens and twenties  --  seemingly by hundreds . Dilly took the frail little image of King George in her lap trying to protect him from the pumpkins which were carelessly tossed at her and often broken . Until the meetinghouse door opened she seemed unable to do anything about a proper head for the effigy  --  only try to protect his straw-filled body . When she found herself practically alone she took a pumpkin and began to carve a face to suit herself . She made eyes little and round , using her knife like an auger . She meant his mouth to be turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mouth smiled . She wired the head to the stake-neck and pulled over it the frowzy wig somebody 's grandfather had died in . The silly grinning thing perched upon her knee . She suddenly found his expression ( which she had made by mistake ) utterly beguiling . By the time the thanksgiving service was over and thep163people trooped out over the common , night had come down . The darkness lent anonymity to everyone . The brandy , cider , ale , wine , and rum that had been drunk began to echo in voices . There was an air of wanton brutality in the laughter there had not been an hour before . Now King George seemed to have been forgotten . The talk was all of a new effigy  --  General Turncoat Benedict Arnold . " We got ta scarlet coat . . . " Mollie yelled , " now we need white britches for Benedict Arnold . " King George sat neglected in Dilly 's lap . She smoothed the dirty wig on his pumpkin head . " Do n't you care , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to have grown enormous . She was swaying slightly , and Dilly knew that she was drunk . But her voice had not lost all of its persuasive charm . " Listen . You put down that puling manikin . Now we want white britches for General Turncoat . He 's a worse feller than King George , even , and I knows where to get them . You come with me . Sparhawk Girls ' backyard . " The Sparhawk house looked naked with its fine fence and gates gone . One window was broken . On the common someone threw a torch into the bonfire . The orange flame roared upward , illuminating the gallows on which the effigy would be hanged . Mollie staggered , recovered herself by sinking her metallic fingers into Dilly 's shoulder . Suddenly Dilly loathed her . The militiamen were supposed to be drawn up under Ensign Pears ready to welcome General Milroy returning in triumph from the wars . They had scattered , but from wherever they were they fired an uneven salvo . Not all were blanks . A child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powder . Mollie , still swaying , her fingers still buried in Dilly 's flesh ,  | threw back her head and listened greedily . Then she laughed . It was as if she had enjoyed the pitiful wailing . Well hidden from the vulgar view , the Sparhawk Girls had a small clothesline where they dried or aired their more intimategarments . No one should know this better than the village washerwoman . Being coldblooded , they had knit themselves long white woollen drawers . Every fall they would take them out , air them on the hidden line before putting them on . " The very pants , " Mollie said , and seized upon a pair of the foolish-looking garments . The Sparhawk Girls had drunk the toast . They had gone to the thanksgiving exercises . They had seen their gates , fence , privy and chicken coops taken for the bonfire and their chickens ( every one a pet ) scattered . Nothing seemed to shake . their aristocratic calm . But their winter underwear whirling about Mollie Magee 's head and the coarse laughter that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Libby put on bonnet and gloves . Miss Stephanie , a younger and less formal woman , came out in her housecap . They were ready to die for their modesty . " Mollie  --  will you please put that down . " " Sure I will . Down General Turncoat Arnold 's throat . Gen'rl Turncoat Arnold 's great'st Judas since Judas what's-his-name . " " Mollie  --  do n't you dare take those garments out to that filthy mob . It is n't modest such things be seen on the common . " " Well , it ai n't modest , is it , such things be seen on you ? I tell yer it 's disgusting to see two old women like you aprancingabout in them white drawers . You talk to me of modesty ! Why , everybody in Fayrely knows how it is you support yourselves these days . Loose-living old wenches  --  that 's what you are . "  |p165Shouts  of joy greeted this most undeserved attack . A large mob was gathering to see the fun . Dilly felt slightly sick . The sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their eyes pin-pricks of horror . Miss Libby cried , " Oh , sister , " and retreated towards the kitchen door . Miss Stephanie  --  a more determined woman  --  seized upon one leg of the garment Mollie held . She pulled and Mollie pulled . " Go it , Moll ; go it , Stephie ! " The leg lengthened and lengthened . One man got behind Mollie , another behind Stephanie . It was a tug-of-war . The drawers came apart at the crotch . It was Mollie who lost her balance and fell in a heap . Miss Stephanie , breathless but undaunted , turned to thank the men and boys who had helped her . Her old-fashioned courtesy was ridiculous at such a moment and all she had actually saved was one elongated leg , certainly not her modesty . Mollie was on her . feet . Her nose was bleeding , for she had struck it with her own fist when the drawers had parted . " Damn blast you , " she said in a low furious voice . Her drunken face was convulsed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finest pair of britches a general ever wore to his hanging . " Then slowly , as though on afterthought , not in a moment of passion , she struck the frail old lady a flat blow across the eyes . Miss Stephanie stood a moment , her mouth open , her eyes glazing , then went down like a bundle of faggots . There was a murmur of protest from her followers who had liked the gallant way Miss Stephanie had defended her property , but no one went near to help her . " She struck me first , " cried Mollie , and burst into tears . Dilly pushed through the stupid , staring crowd . She and Miss Libby reached the fallen woman together . Sheepish and silent , Mollie and her gang melted away.  | Miss Stephanie 's eyes opened . " Sister  --  the sheriff . " " But , sister  --  he 's gone off to meet the general  --  you know . " " Yes . " Dilly let her lie a moment longer with closed lids , then she asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up now , with me to help you ? " " Yes . " She could not have weighed more than a hundred pounds . Dilly practically carried her while Miss Libby followed , clutchingthe one knit leg that had been saved . " It is the humiliation , " announced Miss Stephanie when she had been spread out on the sofa in the living room . " Struck by one 's own washerwoman . Well , I suppose that is what must be expected in a democracy  --  where all men are free to do any evil that they choose  --  and all men are equal ! This is the end of everything decent in America . And my family have lived here for one hundred and fifty years . . . . Sister , a swallow of wine . " " They took it all , sister . " Dilly offered to make tea , but when Miss Libby would have gone with her she said someone should stay with Miss Stephanie . At last she came back with the tray . Both ladies were sitting in straight-back chairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caps and fichus . " Sister  --  my intrigue , I believe . " Dilly was amazed . They were like cats , who , barely escaping death in a dog 's mouth , sit down and demurely wash their fur . They had what was called in Prides Falls " guts . " The three of them sipped their herb tea together as though nothing had happened  --  nor ever would . No mention was made of the racket upon the common . A rising shout , more muskets fired , a tired huzza . I guess they are hanging them now , thoughtp167Dilly , and she felt again that protective feeling towards little King George , who had sat in her lap and grinned his silly pumpkin grin . It was time for her to go . THE orange light of the bonfire lit up the common . In and out of this hellish light men and women appeared and disappeared . From the gallows one figure hung . It was General Benedict Arnold in his white breeches . The scarlet coat was put on backwards as symbol of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  or neglected . She hardly knew how she felt about him . Not once had she heard Alan Brann 's name . There was now no talk of making suspected loyalists drink emetic . She believed she might go home . Hours had passed since word had come of General Milroy 's approach  --  and yet he had not come . But soon now . Any moment . . . And there would be a collation for him at the Wolfe , and Morganna Milroy waiting for him at Milroy Mansion . Morganna Milroy waiting for her husband . There were two or three pistol shots . If the fools keep this up , someone will be killed . Her thoughts were interrupted , for she tripped and fell heavily over a sleeping form . The sleeper slept , her breath coming as smoothly  --  if not as sweetly  --  as a babe 's . It was Mollie Magee , and in her massive arms the tiny king grinned up at Dilly with toothless silliness . EvidentlyMollie had come for the effigy and been overtaken with liquor and languor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herway until well off the common , then broke into a rapid dog-trot . She heard the voices first , and then she saw the men . Adozen or more militiamen were leaning against the Milroy gates talking in low tones . They had been drinking , but were not drunk , and all were armed . One of them said , " We was waiting for you , miss . " " For me ? " " Yes , miss . You gotter tell us where that damned paroled man is . If he 'll join us pleasant-like we wo n't do him no harm . If he does n't , we will . We 're God-damned tired of all these paroled men of Handsome Jack Burgoyne 's . " " I do n't know where he is . " " We heard he was here . We 've searched the house and barn  --  everywhere ' cept only Mrs. Milroy 's chamber . And she ai n't the one to have a man in her chamber  --  not even a husband . " " You went inside the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let us in . We 're militiamen doing our duty  --  ferreting out British soldiers . " " If you are militiamen , why ai n't you on the common waiting to welcome General Milroy home like Ensign Pears told you ? " One of the men laughed and spit . " This is a free country , miss . We fit this war to prove that . Arn Milroy is too danged slow to stand about and wait for . Come on , everybody knows you and that lobster-back are thick as thieves . You go get him for us . " " I ca n't and wo n't . " The first speaker grasped her arm abovethe elbow . His great hand contracted . Her fingers swelled andstood out like sausages . She bit her lips , but did not protest . " Will you ? " " No . " " You damn-blasted plucky kid . You 're too good for a red-coat . " " Leave her alone , Jed . " " You men ease along back to the common , and I 'll joinp169you . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's where the slave says he hangs out . " " All right , boss . " Dilly was left alone with the enormous black shadow that went by the name of Jed . " Too good , " he was saying , " for a redcoat . Look here , do you think us Yankee farmers are going to stand for such things ? " She sparred for time . " What things ? " " You fornicating around with a damn bedbug . And all us Yankee farmers standing about proud and willing to oblige . " " What you say is not true . " " Not true ? Us not willing to oblige ? Why , lady , take me , just as an example . . . I 'm a good New England man . " " I 'm under the protection of General Milroy . Any disrespect you show me you show him . " " If you mean kissing you is like kissing General Milroy , you 're crazy . Now I ai n't going to hurt a hair on your purty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that damned Britisher off your face . Huh . . . so that 's the way you feel about it ? Spitfire , ai n't you ? Do n't come easy  --  eh ? Not too patriotic yourself . " She broke from him , but he interposed his bulk between her and the house which was only a few yards away . If she raised her voice they would hear her inside . She did not raise it . She was confident in herself . " You drunken fool . . . " she whispered . " You call yourself a Yankee farmer . . . . I doubt if you own an inch of ground . A good New England man . . . laugh , it sickens me ! Get away now . . . and leave this house . . . . " He grabbed at her and she jumped back . " You 're comin ' with me . And you 're going to lead us to that Brann 's hidingplace . If you do n't , we 'll find him anyway . He 's up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I and the other boys will swear he attacked us first . Not a person would care enough about that tramp to give him a decent inquest , ' cept you , miss  --  and I 'd come around and comfort you . " What he said was true . If they did want to kill anybody tonight Alan would be safest . Perhaps they would think it fun to kill so friendless a man . Mollie had laughed when the burned child screamed . " Well . . . perhaps then . . . " she countered . " That 's my girl . . . " She had manoeuvred so he was no longer between her and the door . With a bound she was up the three steps , the knocker in her hand . As she expected , he cursed her and threatened Brann , but did not dare approach closer to the general 's house , for inside was Mrs. Milroy and the villagers , drunk or sober , stood in awe of her . MRS . MILROY sat in her parlour . Her powdered head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she counted . " Purl one . Knit two . Purl one . " She finished her row before she looked up at Dilly . " You 've been gone a long time . " The slight disapproval in her voice comforted with its familiarity . Everything seemed so right within these four walls . Dilly glanced at the French clock upon the mantel . A little past eight , and she had supposedit was close on midnight . " The horse came home all right ? " " Before sunset . Frost put him up . I told Frost to make up a bed for himself tonight in the barn . " " I heard the men came here  --  looking for Alan Brann . " Mrs. Milroy pursed her pretty mouth and looked criticallyp171at her knitting . " If one can call them men . Just riffraff and bobtail nobodies . " " Jed ? " There was an accent of horror in Dilly 's voice . Was that slouching brute " nobody " ? " Yes , Jed Towley the tinker and a few other local clowns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off ! " So the formidablemenace of black night was nothing but Towley the Tinker in daytime . Actually the man who ever and again turned up at the back door whining " pots an ' pans to mend . . . any pots ' n ' pans . . . " Almost a beggar , and he called himself a Yankee farmer ! " Purl two , " said Mrs. Milroy , " knit four , cast off . As soon as I heard them pounding on the front door I told Phillis to go out and do whatever they demanded . That 's always wisest of course . ( Cast off . ) I took down my hair , got in my bed and blew out the candle . At last they presented themselves at my chamber door . Said they were hunting British soldiers . ( Purl four . Cast off . ) I gave it to them . " Her eyes flashed . " I told that Jed Towley what General Milroy would do to him . . . thinking to find British soldiers in my chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks back is leaking like a sieve . I told John Plummer why it was Fox Parmenter wo n't have him at the ropewalks . . . and the widow Avery 's son  --  really a decent lad . I told him I 'd tell his mamma , and he looked ready to cry . ( Cast off . ) And you call those rabbits men ? " " Just the same , ma'am , I 'm going to run over to Job 's Folly and tell Alan they are looking for him . They are going by way of the common . I 'll get there first and tell him . " " Knit and cast off ! " " That Jed said they 'd kill him . I wo n't be gone long , ma'am . " " Knit two  --  cast off . No , Dilly , you are not to go . "  | " Ma'am ? " " I hate to think what they might do to a young girl alone in the woods . Knit two  --  cast off . Let me see . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to myself I 'd tell no one . Alan 's safe . He 's here . " " Whereabouts ? " " In my chamber  --  of course . Oh , I 've dropped a stitch ! Dilly , do see if you can pick it up . You are so much more patient than I. " Dilly took the knitting and moved the candle nearer . She tried to manoeuvre for a dropped stitch . The silk purse was fine as a cobweb , the stitches hard to see , and she was in no mood for them . " I 'd better wait for daylight , " she said and looked up for approval . Now that she had lost her handiwork to toy with Mrs. Milroy seemed to have passed completely out of self-control . Dilly glanced at her and , almost ashamed to have read so much upon her face , looked back quickly at her knitting . The last ten rows had been knit whichways . A dozen stitches had been dropped . None ( in spite of Mrs. Milroy 's constant directions to herself ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and around . " Yes . Do n't bother . Put it down . " Dilly put it well away from Mrs. Milroy . She could not bear to think of those tense fingers knitting and knitting and talking about purling and casting off and doing little but drop stitches . Mrs. Milroy began again . " I went for Alan  --  myself . Soon after you left . I ran all the way , and somehow the smell of the woods and the rustle of dried leaves made me so happy . It made me remember all the fall afternoons in our garden at Boston "  --  her voice , low , impassioned , created somethingp173long ago , loved and dead  --  " where I and my brother ( the one who died ) used to run and play every afternoon . I ca n't say why , Dilly  --  but somehow this afternoon was the happiest time I 've had for years . And Alan and I were happy , happy , happy ! Oh , do you realize how rarely a grown person is happy ? And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a little boy and girl playing in the fall of the year . It was almost as if I were once again that little girl  --  and Alan my playfellow . I think it was the smell of the leaves and the soft , dry rustle everywhere  --  and the brook . Did I ever tell you there was a brook in my father 's garden in Boston ? Yes . . . a brook . " She paused , her face soft and sad with memories . " And then , " she went on , " it really grew dark . We had eaten all the chestnuts . Did I tell you that we found and roasted chestnuts ? I said he must come back with me . " " But give a good woodsman the woods and there 's no place he is so hard to find . He 'd be far safer off by himself than hidden in your chamber . " She was thinking of the general 's return any moment . " So Alan said . He said . . . But I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to have him with me . Less than a year ago some roisterers in Hubbarston shot a paroled prisonerof war just for fun . There was n't a law could touch them . They swore he made at them with an axe . Do n't you see ? " sire said fiercely . " It 's men like Towley who are the most dangerous once they get a little out of hand . Their resentment against their betters comes out and they do terrible things . Alan said I was just like every other woman . Women , he said , always feel safe if they can but go upstairs to their rooms and lock the door . " " But you can not keep him there . " " Yes . " Morganna was on her feet.  |p174She  had on a maroon glace dress , so dark as to look black in the folds . Now she was pacing the parlour  --  back and forth . The beautiful dress glowed , darkened and rustled as she turned . She had a handkerchief of finest Flemish flax between her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The clock struck half-past eight . Morganna paused and looked at it as if a friend had spoken to her . " Forever , " she said . There had been so long a pause between the " yes " and the " forever " Dilly did not know whether she meant she would keep Alan Brann forever or time goes on and clocks strike forever . And the longer she paced and tore her handkerchief , the more Dilly realized she was utterly beside herself . She remembered all the nights she had woken and heard Mrs. Milroy pacing her chamber , and she knew that the wild light she now saw  --  on the woman 's face had been the same then as now . At last she came out of her maze and stopped before Dilly . Her voice sounded odd , as though she had not used it for a long time  --  as a voice may sound on first waking . " I know it is the general who is sick , " she whispered , " like his father before him . I looked it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great leathern-bound volume which Dilly now noticed had been carried in from the office . " There  --  look . Job Milroy . I 've figured it out . He was fifty years old , four months , and four days when he died of an apoplexy . And here 's his son . . . no , no ! I have the uncle . Here 's the son  --  Arnold Milroy . Born December seventeenth , 1731 . Hold the candle nearer . Did I figure it aright ? My poor head 's distracted . Next week Wednesday he 'll be exactly the same age . " Dilly seized upon the knitting , She began to rip back to the first of many dropped stitches . Had the woman gone mad ? Sons do not die at a certain age only because their fathersp175have . You do not inherit your death day . But Mrs. Milroy had hoped .. . Mrs. Milroy was standing so quietly the silk did not rustle . There was a silence so ominous Dilly heard her lick her dry lips and the slight sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eight . . . nine , ten . . . fifteen , sixteen , seventeen . . . twenty , twenty-one , twenty-two . Where are your directions , Mrs. Milroy ? " " Over there . " She still stood very close . Dilly would not look at her face , but she saw the bottom of her maroon dress and beneath it the points of two green morocco slippers . " Two stitches too many . " " It does n't matter . " Mrs. Milroy sighed and took another turn across the parlour . It was lucky it did not . Dilly 's counting was as bad as Mrs. Milroy 's knitting . " Dilly . . . when he comes I want him put in the spare room  --  where he always sleeps . Tell him . . . tell everybody I am prostrated with a headache . I will not be disturbed . " " But suppose . . . it is not he who is sick ? " " Yes , " said Morganna reasonably . " I 've thought of that too . Anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not be disturbed . I 'm going up now  --  and I 'd rather you stayed here to welcome them . Are any drummers left on the common ? " " Yes . " " We 'll know when he arrives . " " And there 's to be a reception at the Wolfe . " " Good night , my dear . " But Dilly had to speak out . She said quickly , " Alan Brann must be gone . He must go now . From your chamber window , ma'am , he could drop down and be off . No one would see himp176. . . or hear him and then he would be safe . Do n't keep him , ma'am . . . . " The woman nodded her head . " You are right . No one but a fool would do otherwise . And the window . .. ' t is a good thought . " Dilly stood up . The knitting fell from her lap . She put both arms around Mrs. Milroy . She not only felt how much taller she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little thing in her arms as she had in General Milroy 's . They stood locked together in a long heartbreaking embrace . Both were in tears . Dilly felt as if she was saying good-bye to Morganna Milroy forever . At last the woman murmured , " You will never forget me ? " " Never . " And after a long pause Mrs. Milroy said , " You know , Dilly . . . do n't you ? " Dilly knew she wanted to say , You know I love Alan Brann . " Yes , " she said . " And you know it is wrong  --  and do not hate me ? " " I 've given up trying to think of right and wrong . I will always love you . " She heard Mrs. Milroy ascending the stairs , closing the door behind her . She was with Alan Brann . And doubtless she was telling him that he must go away  --  and never come back . The girl brushed impatiently at her streaming eyes and took up the knitting . What was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick up dropped stitches . It was soothing to feel the tiny stitches giving one after the other so obediently to her hand and the ball growing bigger and bigger . The silk came to an end . She looked at her fingers in amazement . She had ripped it all out . The thought of Mrs. Milroy 's anger tomorrow over herp177stupidity brought her to her senses . She picked up the directionsand cast on the right number of stitches . There had been only seven inches knit correctly before Madame had gone mad . Surely she could get that much done tonight . Then she heard a distant rumble . The roll of drums . The crying of the fife . At the same moment the wind raced about the house , tearing dead leaves from trees and clapping shutters . There was a loose spatter of rain . And then the wind and the rain were both gone . A rattle of musketry . Shouts . Her stomach contracted into a hard small ball and sank to the bottom of her pelvis , rose up in her throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sofa and covered both ears with her hands . SHE lay there and it seemed that hours had passed as the drumming and piping , shouts , shots , and singing grew close . She sat up and she could hear men 's feet , the jingle of horsegear , and she saw the reflection of torches . Now they were only outside the door . She must get to that door and welcome the Milroy men . A hearty laugh . General Milroy 's . She guiltily closed the Bible  --  open to birthdays , wedding days and death days of Milroys . She flung her flimsy knitting on top as if to hide it . Mrs. Milroy had hoped . . . " Easy , easy , " General Milroy was saying . " The lad 's pretty sick . " Claude 's voice , " Leave him in the chaise , sir , until a bed has been fixed . " Dilly 's feet dragged behind her as though she walked through water . She only got as far as the door into the hall . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairway.  |p178Morganna  was ahead of her . She was opening the door . Dilly saw that without a word the husband and wife were in each other 's arms . She saw the tears in Morganna 's eyes  --  and this did not surprise her . But tears in the general 's  --  and in his voice as well ! Morganna 's lips met his fairly without any of her old captious coquetry . ( It was Alan Brann who had taught her to kiss thus heedlessly . ) These two drew aside , and there stood Captain Claude asking for a bed for his father 's servant . Morganna was laughing hysterically now and mopping at her cheeks with a fresh Flemish handkerchief . She clung to General Milroy . " Your servant . And all afternoon I 've been out of my mind thinking it was you ! No , no  --  let me weep . The worry has driven me outside my faculties . " " Put him in my chamber , " Dilly said to Claude . " Your chamber , sir . " There was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the fireplace . Claude and another man carried the heavy limp form of a soldier up the stairs . Dilly noticed how spruce and bright was the sick man 's uniform ; his baldric freshly pipe-clayed . He could not be very sick . She had judged him as she might an animal . As long as its coat is shiny , one need not worry . She asked Claude if she should fetch him food and drink . " Cold water and a little brandy  --  if he 'll take it . But bed and rest are what he needs . Now I wonder if the poor devil ever slept betwixt sheets before ? " He undressed the sick man with masculine compassion and took pains to set the candle so it would not shine in his eyes . Then ( his duties being done ) he turned to Dilly . " Hello , " he said , and held out his hand as though he had just gotten around to seeing her . " We won , " he whispered with a confidential nod.  | " We did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long war was over . The sick soldier was breathing shallowly and rapidly . He had not said a word . Dilly had seen his great bare chest matted over with golden hair , but she had not seen his face . She walked down the stairs with Claude . " There is nothing you can do for him , " said Claude in answer to her question . " But I will sit with him . " " Yes , do so . I and my father must go to the Wolfe  --  immediately . I will take your place when I come back . Poor fellow ! One moment he was all right and the next could n't sit his horse . It was as though something had broken inside him . Now to get the general started . Well-a-day . . . ! " There upon the yellow satin sofa sat General Milroy and his lovely lady , seemingly lost in one another . They could not see Morganna 's face , but the general 's they saw . It had softened and grown young . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trust . " You have thought over what I said ? " " Yes , " she murmured , " and you are right . " Claude moved restlessly . Dilly knew that he too did not quite believe Morganna honest . She felt a moment of disgust that Mrs. Milroy could play-act thus . She saw the white arms emerging from the loose sleeves of the shining maroon gown tightening about the general 's heavy shoulders . Saw a porcelainhand steal up to caress the dimple in the thick ruddy cheek , drawing his face closer to hers . Oh , this was betrayal more shameless than her love for Alan Brann ! This was in-famy ! " And you must go now , " Morganna was saying . " Claude waits for you . All Fayrely waits for you . " The general got up , his heavy figure in spite of short legs and a paunch magnificent in its bear-like virility . He stood staring at his wife as though physically unable to tear himself from her . " As soon as I can  --  with courtesy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Morganna caught her lower lip between her teeth . " Quicker than that , " she begged , panting slightly . Her face was pale , her eyes restless , reckless . Her bosom was heaving . She seemed to be a woman barely able to wait another moment for her lover 's embrace . Dilly thought coldly , How sly she is ! She knew she could never hide her excitement  --  her craziness  --  so she has pretended it is all for him . Morganna said in a low voice , " You will not take it amiss , sir , if I do not sit up until your return from the collation ? Go to my own room and await you there ? " There could be no mistaking her meaning . It flashed through Dilly 's mind that Alan Brann and she had decided all was over between them . He was already gone away . She knew the strength and desperation of Morganna 's will . If she had indeed made up her mind she was done with Alan she might turn even thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overdone ) was , in a way , honest . She was so relieved that she laughed out loud . She had forgotten Claude , standing beside her , hearing what she heard , seeing what she saw . " I was laughing too , " said Claude cryptically . He entered the parlour and affectionately took his father 's arm . Time to be off . Dilly stood at the open door where men with torches and lanterns waited the returned hero . The general mounted a beautiful white charger . The group turned and instantly they dropped from sight . Only the white horse glowed in moonlight and torchlight.  | " Shall I bolt the door ? " she called over her shoulder to Mrs. Milroy , still sitting in the parlour . " No , there 's nothing more to fear this night . " " Then I shall go and sit with the soldier . " She did not wish to enter the parlour again nor face Mrs. Milroy , but she gave a hasty glance inside . The lady sat stiff and quiet upon the sofa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She looked at the man lying upon the bed . He was moving as though uncomfortable , although not in pain . His voice came at last , thick and guttural . " Fraulein . . . " he said . She picked up the candle and held it so its light shone upon his face . The ruddy colour was gone , but the clear blue animal eyes were unchanged . It was Hans Pfalz  --  Captain Sparrow 's beloved " mechanical man . " THERE was no click as Alan Brann 's fingers released the latch on Morganna Milroy 's chamber door . No sound from that room where he knew she lay exhausted upon her bed . For almost an hour they had argued , their voices never rising above whispers . The actual point of discussion had never been stated . He knew what it was she had begged of him  --  in every way except words . He was to murder the general . And there was but one way to do it . Go now to the common , hide himself and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1w would  --  for a moment upon the lighted threshold he would be greeted by shouts , and shots of welcome would be fired . And then one shot . . . No one would ever know who the enthusiastic , besotted militiaman might be.  | No . She had not said these words . Hysterically she had insistedthat with all this crazy shooting going on " something awful " would happen . Someone would get killed  --  and no one ever know who was responsible . By what infernal mischance had she been able to extract from the general 's holster a pistol during the brief time the man had been under his own roof ? Morganna had said she had taken it because , if Alan deserted her , turned her over to her husband , she would kill herself . Alan shifted his weight to his forward foot , took one more step down the stairs . Quietly  --  softly , quietly . . . In yonder room was Dilly Lavander and the general 's sick servant . The stair creaked and he froze . His nerves were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when at last he had taken the pistol from her clutching fingers she had smiled at him and relaxed . She had been sure he would do as she wished . His foot touched another stair . He poured his weight forwardsas delicately as a woman pours three drops of priceless attar of roses from one vial to another . As God lives ! I 'm no murderer ! Yet he was still a British officer . No treaty had been signed . A Continental general was fair game . No . He could walk out of this house , disappear into night and be gone forever . No . Morganna Milroy . . . he could not deserther . Once he might have . Once he had tried . . . and she had followed him and brought him back , bound him to her . Coil upon shining coil , he felt her about him . If you do not resist , you hardly feel the tightness of the coils . For almost two months he had not resisted . They had been happy together  --  andat peace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said  --  take her own life  --  for he had never met man or woman with half the determination of Morganna Milroy . She was right . There was only one solution for their predicament  --  andhe held the solution in his hand . As he gained the last step and stood before the front door he paused and glanced at the pistol . He had always loved weapons , and he saw that this was a beauty . Not English . American ? Too fine . It was French . Such always come in pairs . Duelling pistols . And why not a duel ? And let the best man win ! He would go to the general like a man , tell him he loved his wife and she him . Why had he not thought before of this honourable solution ? There would be some fuss and ceremony . And who might he get for a second ? It did not matter . He opened the front door . The well-oiled hinges swung with never a sound . The moon broke free of the clouds . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the barn . He stopped close by he well . He heard a horse walking upon the road beyond the gates . General Milroy could not be coming home thus early and unattended ? A white charger turned in and he guessed who the heavy mounted man was . Too late ! Oh , why had he not gone to the common  --  hidden in the crowd  --  fired his shot and fled away ! He had not yet made up his mind what he would do . His body dripped with sweat , but the skilful hands which instinctively cocked the pistol did not shake . The moon disappeared . Now  --  now 's  --  your -- chance . Now  --  now 's  --  your  --  chance . The words rang in his head , but he could not think . The sound of hooves on gravel approached close to where be half crouched by the well . Now  --  now 's  --  your  --  chance . Now . . . The white horse glowed in the darkness . There was a slight creak of saddle , a jingle of bits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw , smelt , or heard him andp184stopped short . Slowly the moon struggled to free itself once more . " Morganna . . . " whispered the general . The moon shone full upon Alan Brann 's face . The two men  --  one on horseback , one on foot  --  stared silently , stared stupidlyat each other in white moonlight . Arn Milroy recognized the man he had bidden leave his house  --  and his wife  --  forever months ago . DILLY thought she had sat for an hour  --  two hours  --  she did not know how long , beside the bed where the sick man lay . He was not suffering . Perhaps he slept . It seemed years ago ( not months ) that she had marched out of Worcester beside him . Mile after mile to Fayrely . She remembered the very rhythm of Hans 's marching . Chin up , haunches back . Left , right , left , right . " You march damn goot , Fraulein . " Captain Sparrow 's mechanical man , whom some Hessian drillmaster had caught and wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the captain said he would run ? Hardly a human being . And what happens to mechanical men when they start to run down ? Hans 's breath came rapidly . She felt his pulse . It jumped unevenly , stopped and went on again . Claude had told her there was nothing she might do for him  --  only let him rest . She saw the heavy hands plucking at each other , and she rememberedthese same hands offering themselves as a bootjack for his officer , holding a basin of water , shaving Captain Sparrow  --  who obviously did not want to be shaved . Hans had shown no sign of recognizing her . In the morning when he was better she would ask him how it was he now came as the general 's servant . He had said little and that little inp185German . Now he began to roll his head back and forth upon the pillow . " Meine Mutter , " he said . " Your mother ? " " Nein . Mutter . " She took one of his great paws in hers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Captain Sparrow ? " she asked in a clear voice . " Tod . " " Dead ? " " Dead . " Now he was restless all over . She had seen a similar restlessnessin beasts about to bear their young . The flesh  --  but not the mind  --  knows the approach of fate . She wet a cloth in the basin of water and wiped off his face and throat . " Gut . " Once again he sank back in coma . Claude had said . . . But soon now Claude and General Milroy would be coming back from the inn , and the collation  --  victorious heroes . Slowly and horribly the unconscious face began to change . She saw the emergence of the skull . The lips drawn back from yellowed broken teeth . His head had become the very symbol of death . She drew back instinctivly . She had never seen anyonedie , and she now knew that die he must . She wanted to call Mrs. Milroy  --  Phillis . No , she must go through this alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the pulse still fluttering . " Hans , " she said gently . His eyes opened . " Trink , " he said . " Drink ? " " Jawohl . " She poured a little brandy in a cup , raised his heavy shoul/der against her compassionate breast , and pressed the cup to his grey lips . The smell of brandy offended him . He jerked his head away and struck rudely at the cup . The brandy spilt . His energy ( although provoking ) encouraged her . He could not be going to die . She filled the cup again  --  this time with water . He drank eagerly . Then she felt his body stiffen . There was a queer embarrassed look about the lips and eyes . " Entschuldigen Sie mir , " he murmured , vomited , and died . She heard a horse turn in the driveway below her window , walking slowly towards the barn . She doubted if it were the general . He would not be allowed to return so quietly . ProbablyClaude . When Claude came in she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would sit thus quietly . She drew the curtains closer about the bed . . . and sat with her head in her hands . Why had this German peasant come so far to die at last amongst strangers ? " Meine Mutter , " he had said . How had Captain Sparrow happened to die ? And had he too in his extremity thought of his mother ? Her revery was interrupted by the crack of a pistol not far away , possibly on the road beyond the gates . There had been so much foolish shooting ever since four that afternoon she thought no more of it . Her mind wandered back to Captain Sparrow . She remembered him with affection  --  his tiny bones , his somewhat wizened little face . She had known he would die . Some men are like that . Whoever had come into the yard must have entered by the kitchen . Doubtless it was the general . He had said he would come home as soon as he might " sneak away . " Morganna 's door is opening . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him  --  welcoming him . She has sent Alan Brann away . . . and from now on she will be a good wife to Arn Milroy . And yet . . . she had overacted that scene upon the yel/low sofa . Dilly had known it was false  --  Claude had known . The general had not . So now the general and his wife were together . There was no sound through the house . Strange . . . this silence . Never before had General Milroy entered without the sound of his hearty laughter and heavy tread rising up to the attic . Very silent was the house . The silence grew until it was a ghostly thing pressing against her , suffocating her . And it seemed to emanate from the dead body of Hans Pfalz . She was afraid of it . No , no ! She must sit a little longer . Give General Milroy and his wife these sacred moments of reconciliation alone . She had no idea how long she had sat with the dying soldier nor how long with his dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sofa . Her blackish red skirts were stiff about her , yard upon yard of costly silk . Her face was frozen into a semblance of calmness . Her fingers clutched her knitting . Only the quick rise and fall of her breathing showed her perturbation . A shot had been fired . She believed , rather close to the house . It might be one more drunken celebrant passing on the road . Locked in her chamber she had not heard the approach of a solitary horseman . She had heard one shot . Then silence . She had felt that shot as though it had pierced her own body . It . might be . . . oh , it was even possible . . . Arn Milroy had sneaked home alone and meeting Alan Brann shot him on sight . It might be that Alan Brann . . . yes . . . She had begged it of him . Oh , but she had been beside herself . He could not have thought she really meant he was to . . . She had recovered from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alan Brann who fired that shot . She believed the two men had met and one of them had died . But which ? which ? Her fingernailsbit into her palms . Her teeth into her lips . Which , which would now be coming back to her ? The front door swung open so quietly she was more conscious of the raw cold night air upon her than of any sound . Not General Milroy . He was a noisy man . Alan Brann stood before her , young , bloody , afraid . " He is dead , " he said in a low voice . " Hush . . . not so loud . . . Alan . " She shrank a little from him , from the expression in his eyes and the blood upon him . " I did not kill him . " " But how ? " ' He killed himself . " Morganna was swallowing rapidly and a curious grimace contracted her mouth . At last she was able to articulate " Arn Milroy killed himself ? " She stared at her lover 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not one person will believe it , " she whispered . " Not one , Morganna  --  except you . " " Not one  --  except me . " She put her hands over her eyes , but she could not cry . So she raised her face . " Alan . . . tell me how . " " Morganna "  --  his voice broke  --  " he thought I was you , and the moon came out . He got off his horse . I told him what I had to tell him . " " What was that ? " " Why  --  I had to tell him we loved one another  --  and you hated him , and between us we had betrayed him . "  |p189She  looked at him in amazement . " You are crueler than I , Alan Brann . " " I said we would settle , this matter  --  like gentlemen . A duel . " " Yes ? " " He said he was n't a gentleman  --  I was to ask you . He said he 'd never fought a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry ? " " No . " " What was he ? " " Oh , God , I do n't know . " Her eyes were fixed upon him , her lips contracted once more in their curious grimace . " Alan  --  there 's blood upon your shirt . . . your hands . " She was struggling to gain possession of herself  --  to think . " We must wash it off . Any moment Claude , or Dilly or Phillis . ' Wait . . . " When she came back from the kitchen she carried a ewer of hot water , a basin , towels , a fresh shirt . She was master now of even this situation . She took the bloody shirt from him . He was naked to the waist . She washed him tenderly . It was her husband 's blood she washed away . " Alan . . . Alan , " she murmured and ' pressed her cheek against the rippling living flesh of his young flank . She kissed the hollow of the shoulder , where her head had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , " he said . " As I asked ? " " Kill him . . . as he came out of the Wolfe . . . with the lights behind his head . " " I never did . . . . I never even mentioned the Wolfe . " " In every way except words , Morganna . " " No ! "  | " I say yes ! " He drew back and looked at her , his tired face flushed . " We ca n't quarrel now , Alan . " He laughed ruefully . " I doubt if we can keep from it . " " I can and I will . . . oh , my dear . . . my dearest . " He moved from her and paced the short length of the parlour . Her heart turned to water at sight of him . The beauty of that rippling half-naked body  --  the beauty of the young male  --  so much more living and to her more wonderful than the beauty of women . Every slightest movement of the muscles was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mere handfuls of meringue at their best  --  great lumpish dead flesh at their worst ! Here was a greater feeling for life  --  as well as greater strength . In its own way more delicate . There were tears in her eyes  --  but not for the blood that discoloured the water in the basin . " It is true , " she said . " I wanted him dead . I prayed for him to die . " She pressed her hands over her face and was silent for a moment . At last she said , " Tell me . . . was he drunk ? " " Cold sober . He simply asked me if I lied . I told him I did not , and he took my word . Then he saw the pistol in my hand  --  it was cocked . He snatched it from me . I thought he intended to kill me and jumped away . I heard the shot and he fell . He groaned a very little . . . and dragged himself a few feet . Then I went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He bled a good deal . That 's how I bloodied myself . " " Alan . . . it was an accident . " " It was not . I saw his face . His face when he believed me . " Her lips trembled . Without speaking she took up the fresh shirt and pulled it over him . He submitted to her care like a tired child . She gingerly picked up the bloody rust-coloured shirt and threw it on the hearth fire . It smouldered , smelt a little , and burst into flames . The wet and bloody towel shep191could not burn except by holding it over the fire with the tongs . It steamed , scorched , and burst into flames . " The basin of water ! " Once more she seemed the fastidious housewife , interested in nothing but the meticulous order of her house . She carried the basin to the window with both hands . " Alan , open it for me ! " The night air came in cold , menacing , as though from another world . From far away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the animal upon her tracks . Her hand went out to her lover , not so much asking protection from him as promising it to him . " Alan . . . you must go away now . " " Yes . . . but where ? " " I do n't know yet . But when they come . . . when they know . . . you must be far away . They might think it was you , Alan . . . . " " They might think it . . . and prove it , I suppose . " " You must go . I have money hid away . You must take it . . . and a horse . Some way we can make it appear that when the general died you were far away . Dilly will have heard the shot . Phillis . . . Listen . . . could you get to Worcester in an hour ? " " With a decent horse  --  of course . " She went to the clock upon the mantel and turned ahead its hands exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Worcester by eleven I 'll get my household to swear the shot was fired shortly before that time . Alan . . . you must go now . His face lighted up . He was ready to go  --  to see this house and woman never again as long as he lived . " But , my dear , they will say that you . . . " " There 's nothing to fear , " and she lied bravely . " I was with Dilly when the shot was fired . And I can prove it . Do n't worry for me . But they must never guess there was love between us two . Alan . . . if they question you  --  as indeed they will  --  say it was Dilly . . . . " " Of course . " " Alan , one thing we must face . Not one person in all the world will believe General Milroy shot himself . It was not in him . Yet it was . I believe you . If we tell the truth how you loved his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your hand . . . oh , ca n't you see what they will say ? Let them think it was some old soldier with a spite  --  a drunken reveller . And I 'll prove that close to the moment the general died you were in Worcester . " " But , Morganna , are there other clocks or watches about ? " " No other clock . Claude 's watch . Last time he was home it was broken . We must take a chance he has not a new one . And General Milroy 's . . . that old turnip watch he exchanged with one of Baron von Reisdal 's officers for a pair of shoes . He had it . . . he has it on . " " Yes "  --  and they both thought of the living watch ticking upon the body of the dead man . " We must hurry . " " Yes . " But he could not get up and go out again to the dark place between well and barn where the general had died and get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it on with her usual care . The hood must come just so upon cheeks and forehead . Below the cape glowed and swayed the yards of blackish maroon glace . " You 'll need a lantern , " he murmured . " No . The moon is out . Alan , where . . . " " Betwixt the well curb and the barn . " When she came back she looked her thirty-three years and many more . Lines had come from nostril to mouth tip . Herp193cheeks had hollowed . She was no more the young love of the autumn woods . That was gone from her face  --  perhaps from her heart . She had a turnip watch in her hands and was turningit curiously as though she had never seen such a watch before . " It has stopped , Alan . " The bullet had struck it . It had stopped at 9.36 . " Give it me . " He tried to pry the bent hands with his fingers . " I ca n't budge the second hand . Give me your brooch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the mantel . " The hour hand turns . " " No , no  --  not the same time . " She calculated . " A few minutesearly. io.48  --  oh , ro.36 is close enough ! Oh , quick , my darling . And trust me . Trust me . All will be well . Take a horse  --  any horse . Keep hidden until you are out of Fayrely . When you get to Worcester go boldly to a tavern and order ale and berate the tapster that it is not better drawn . And fuss about the linen upon your bed . Make love to the chambermaidanything  --  onlythat they notice you , and do not forget that you must immediately demand the time . What time is it ? ' say you , and when they tell it say they are wrong  --  make some gentleman show you his watch . . . . Alan . . . You 've got to go now , " and " Good-bye , " she cried and pressed her mouth to his and clung to him . Even as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only a breath of icy air told her the front door had opened and closed upon Alan Brann . And he is through with me , she thought . This is the end . She felt the goose skin crawl upon her bare arms . Sometime she must scream , cry out , bite lips and wrists until they bleed . Not now . She heard a foot upon the stair and knew the next moment she must face Dilly . She felt calm , confident , strong . She could face anyone.  | MRS . MILROY 'S face was in shadow , but Dilly saw her hands deftly knitting at the purse . " He 's dead , " the girl blurted . Mrs. Milroy 's hands dropped the knitting and went to her throat . " What ? " " Hans died . Oh , Mrs. Milroy , he talked German to me and I could n't understand . I could n't get the things he wanted . Captain Sparrow 's dead too . And he talked about his Mutter '  --  is that German for mother ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The hands came down from the shadows about her throat and lay in the lighted lap . Dilly had not seen her face . " Hans ? " She seemed to have forgotten him . " Who is . . . oh , of course , the general 's servant . So he died . . . " And she laughed . The sudden rough laugh reminded Dilly of the way Mollie Magee had laughed when the burned child screamed . " My dear , can you see the clock from where you stand ? What time is it ? " " ' Deed I can , ma'am . ' T is five of eleven . " " Ten fifty-five . " Dilly obediently repeated the phrase after her , thinking she had been corrected . " Ten fifty-five . " " You should have called me  --  or Phillis . " " Did the general come home ? I heard a horse turn in . Where is General Milroy ? " " Celebrating the end of the war . Probably very drunk by now . "  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hans ? " " I 'll call Phillis . Late as it is "  --  and she glanced at the clock  --  reading it easily from where she sat  --  " three minutes to eleven  --  we must lay him out properly . ' T is no work for a young girl , but Phillis likes corpses . " She transfixed her knittingwith the needles and laid it down . " I 'll get that blackamoorout of her bed . Will it please you , Dilly "  --  she rose to her feet , hesitated a moment before she finished her command as though she was making up her mind to do a difficult thing  --  " take the kitchen buckets and fill them with fresh water from the well ? But stay . . . did you hear a shot not long ago ? " " Yes . It was then that Hans died . The shot came right after . " " Dilly , how long ago . . . ? " The girl was impatient at the question . " It was nothing , ma'am . Folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting all night . " " About fifteen minutes ago ? " " Why  --  more or less . I care not . " When Dilly came back from the well she found Phillis alone in the kitchen grumbling over the fire she was building upon the hearth . " If dat boy died lak he odder die on de battlefield , who wash him den ? Nebber wash when he alive , why wash= ' em now he dead ? " The young girl stood stiff and still , a slopping bucket in either hand . She was badly frightened . " Phillis . . . I wonder if I should tell Mrs. Milroy ? " " Tell her what , child ? " " Just after I 'd filled my buckets and turned around I saw a man  --  and I think it must be the general lying there by the well . He must have come home befuddled and fallen off hisp196horse . And he 's so still . . . I 'm afraid he 's hurt . I did n't go near him . " " Dat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stall . Gen'l do n't know nuf ter pull his head in . But it never hurts drunk mens to fall off horses . . . why , down in Virginny I see . . . " They had not heard Mrs. Milroy 's approach . She was standing by the door . " Who fell off what horse ? " Both jumped and turned about to stare at her . Her face was white , her voice mechanical , and she gave a queer forced smile . " Gen'l off his horse , ma'am . Miss here says he 's a-lying out dere by de well . Drunk , I guess . " Mrs. Milroy tried to speak , licked her lips and surprisingly she said , " Tell me the time . . . . " " High time folks is in bed . Now , ma'am , you git yourself off . " " Dilly . . . will you run to the parlour and look out the time for me ? " Dilly came back and said it was quarter past eleven . " Eleven fifteen . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . Phillis , I told Frost to make up a bed for himself in the barn tonight . Fetch him in . He and you can manage the soldier  --  and the general as well , ca n't you ? I 'm so tired . Oh , God , so tired ! " She staggered as she left the kitchen . " Miss , you go upstairs with her . She 's a fussy piece and no mistake . Dat corpse done upset her . " Mrs. Milroy was sitting on the edge of her bed . " A quarter to eleven , " she murmured to herself . Dilly started to unlatch the green morocco slippers , but Mrs. Milroy , knowing they were blood-stained , drew them well under her skirts . " No , no . My night rail , my dressing gown , my cap . " At last she was conscious of a great wet stain upon her skirt , for she had knelt beside her husband as he lay upon the ground . Luckily thep197dress was close to the colour of blood . The stain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself of these slippers  --  this dress , her white petticoats , before it was too late . From behind the house Phillis bellowed for Frost . " Hey dere . . . you , Frost . . . hey . . . ey . . . ey . . . " It was like the howling of an animal . " Hey . . . ey . . . " Mrs. Milroy shivered . " Frost , " she said . " He 'll be sleeping in his clothes , of course . . . men of that rank . . . It will not take him long . Dilly , you had better go down now . I can finish by myself . It may be . . . it might be . . . Arn has hurt himself . Arnold Milroy  --  and he promised me security and content forever ! That 's all I 'll ever ask of life . . . . " Dilly said the name she had sworn to herself never to mention , " Alan Brann . " " It was hours ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least . Twenty years ago and I was a little girl playing in my father 's garden . " Her fingers plucked at each other as earlier in the evening Hans Pfalz 's fingers had plucked . Dilly moved restlessly . She knew Mrs. Milroy ( given the chance ) would talk on and on in that low nostalgic voice  --  once more explain about the brook , the brother who had died . They both heard the front door open , a subdued murmur of voices . Feet shuffling under a heavy burden . . . . Morganna took Dilly 's hands in hers . " Go , Dilly , " she said , " and God go with you . " CLAUDE , Phillis and Frost were standing about the yellow satin sofa in the parlour . Their backs were to the door . They gazed at the dark object lying there and they were doing nothing . Dilly guessed they did nothing because there was nothing to do.  | " Captain Claude , " she said . The young man moved at the sound of her voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Immediately his eyes went back to the sofa . " Captain . . . he 's badly hurt ? " " Yes , Dilly . " " Shall I tell her to come down ? " " I 'm going for her myself in a moment . Frost , take Paris and ride for Sheriff Parmenter . He 'll still be at the inn . Tell him ( and tell no one else ) what you know . Bid him here . I will not have that damned mob over here . Dilly . . . General Milroyis dead . Someone shot him . " She heard his words , but it was as if they still hung in the air  --  could not enter her ears , much less her mind . " Shot him ? " she said stupidly . The words meant nothing to her . " I said so . " Anger and grief made Claude 's voice impatient . His fingers stiffened about hers as he said the next words . " And where in God 's name is that Alan Brann ? I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered Alan Brann with the trapped fawn in his arms . She answered automatically , " When he heard General Milroy was coming home he went away . He could n't stay . " " Could n't face the wronged husband ? " She was silent . " You will not deny that they were lovers ? " " I will deny . " " In the presence of that murdered man ? " " I will ! " " Ay . Deny and deny , Dilly . It will do them no good . " Frost came in . " Paris gone , sir . " " You blasted fool ! Take my horse . Take Ruby . Go on your legs . I care not so only you go . " He murmured to Dilly or top199himself , " It seems to me the murderer left on my father 's French charger . " Dilly felt a necessity to disbelieve everything the captain believed . This contrariness did not come from the mind . She had not taken in the full implications of what had happened . " Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " May have been . . . . I doubt it . Pistol shots do not frighten war horses . Paris has been trained to stand beside a fallen rider . Whoever shot my father left upon that horse . " He went to the sofa and knelt . He took one coarse cool hand in his . " We will find your murderer , " he promised . He had loved his father for what he was , and never expected too much from him . Wearily he stood up . " I 'll get Madame down and over her hysterics . Perhaps by the time the sheriff gets here she 'll be fit to talk . " Uninvited , Dilly followed him up the stairs . She felt a swift male brutality emanating from his back . She was afraid of what he might do to Mrs. Milroy , but she still could not quite understand what had happened , or why Mrs. Milroy might be in danger . Mrs. Milroy lay upon her bed , and there was no light except from the scattered embers on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearth . Claude did not . He entered without knocking . " Mrs. Milroy . . . " His voice cut all out of proportion to its volume  --  as a grass blade cuts the nerves more than the finger . " You must be up and down in time to meet the sheriff . Your husband has been murdered . " " Claude . . . ! " He could not see her face and too late he realized that his first announcement of the crime should have been made in a well-lighted room . " Yes , " he cried bitterly . " I 'm Claude . "  | " Quick . . . fetch me a light . Dilly . . . where is Dilly ? Yes . A light . Claude , it can not be murder . Do not dare say such a word . He came home drunk and fell from his horse . Dilly told me . . . but I thought . Oh , Claude , he fell and hit his head . " " Are you trying to tell me he fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I see it . " He was angry at his own stupidity , for he could not see her face . Had she known ? Was she surprised , frightened , grief-stricken ? He had no idea . " Now get up , madame  --  and no more of your play-acting tricks . Tell me quickly where that Alan Brann may be . " " Worcester . He went there hours ago . " " Worcester . I 'll send after him . As God lives if I am right he shall hang for this . " Now a candle had been lighted . Its light fell on Mrs. Milroy'sface . There was a queer averted secret look to it . " Dilly and I both heard the shot ( and thought nothing of it ) . It was just twenty minutes of eleven o'clock , was n't it , Dilly ? " " Just about . " " Alan Brann had been gone for hours . " " Maybe . But let him prove it . " Mrs. Milroy had not taken off her stays and had put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immaculate flesh of shoulders and arms . " My grey paragon , " she commandedDilly , even at such a time realizing that sober hues best suit bereavement . Dilly found it , and a comb . She sat besideMrs . Milroy and combed and shaped her curls for her . Claude stood with his back to the door frame , his arms folded upon his chest , watching . Somewhat late Mrs. Milroy seemed to realize she had expressed no grief for the dead man . " I do not see how I can live without Arn . " The words sounded hollow.  | " You may not have to live long , " Claude said brutally . " That will depend on Brann 's story of this night 's madness . " Ever since Dilly had seen the dead man lying upon the sofa she had been wrapped in a protective numbness . She could hear words but hardly take them in . She could move about and even speak , but nothing had reached through the fog to her . Now suddenly the shell about her cracked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She felt her hands go to her mouth to stifle a cry . It was only a gasping moan , but in her own ears it had been a terrible scream  --  warning Mrs. Milroy . But Mrs. Milroy seemed to feel no threat . " Truly , I hope not , " she said , and , " Dilly , my slippers . . . the black cloth ones . " The girl 's fingers were trembling so she could hardly pick them up , much less tie them . Mrs. Milroybent and did so for herself . Softly she touched Dilly 's hair . Horses in the yard . Men 's voices . Claude left them and went to the stair head . " We 'll be right down , sheriff . " Morganna whispered to Dilly , " Yes . . . I know what 's in Claude 's mind . It is n't true , Dilly . I swear to you by God himself . Alan and I are both innocent of this crime . You must believe in me . " " I believe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell below . . . what Claude thinks is not true . " Dilly looked her squarely in the face and she knew the woman spoke the truth . Yet it gave her a strange feeling to hear Morganna call not only upon the name of God , but upon hell as well . The two women left the chamber . Claude said to Dilly , " I believe the coroner 's jury will sit tonight . Will you order Phillis to lay out food and drink in the dining room ? He bowed slightly as he offered his arm to his stepmother . She took it more graciously than it was offered and swept forth from herp202chamber . She held her head high , but when she reached the last stair Dilly heard a small muffled sob . Even at that moment , believing utterly in the woman 's innocence , Dilly thought how little sobs would affect Claude  --  and how much the portly sheriff . DILLY sat in the dining room , the food and drink Claude had ordered on the mahogany table . The smell of cheese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The door was open into the parlour , and she could hear voices . The sheriff seemed to have but one thought and that was to comfort the bereaved woman . No sooner had she met him than she had burst into tears . That was some time ago , but still she wept . " Madame , " he was saying , " I swear to you your husband shall be revenged . " Then Morganna 's tired sobbing , " God our only comfort . . . " Dilly lost the end of that sentence . And Parmenter said , " Do not forget I loved Arn Milroy as though he were my brother . I swear to you by yonder dead body justice will be done . To think any thief could be so bold . . . Robbery and murder  --  and of such a man  --  so close to our common . " Claude came into the dining room , took up a decanter of brandy and poured himself a stiff drink . " Put all this stuff away ! " he commanded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must wait till morning ! " Obviously he was angry . His black hair ruffled and curled upon his head . He had lost his queue ribbon and it was beginning to unbraid . His white neckclothwas awry , his eyes bloodshot and his face haggard . Yet his tousled condition made him seem younger than the spruce officer Dilly had seen before . He obviously did not want to bep203questioned , but Dilly was not afraid of him , and she felt she had to know . " Is there anyone they suspect , Captain Claude ? " " Oh , so you 're still here  --  and still talking , " he answered irritably . " Seems my father had a wallet with over a thousand dollars in it . He pulled it out at the Wolfe  --  lots of queer folk at the Wolfe tonight . Drunk too . Well  --  ' t is gone . Parmenter is sure "  --  he tossed off the rest of his drink  --  " robbery , says Parmenter . General tried to defend himself and the fellow shot him with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And my father 's charger  --  that French stallion , Paris . He 's gone too . Worth close to another thousand dollars if the fellow has the cheek to try to sell him . " He strode back into the parlour , his shoulders bristling with chagrin . So it was robbery ! Of course that was what had happened . Dilly stifled a hysterical desire to laugh . She felt she had been drowning and now for the first time her head was above water . Robbery ! And Claude had been thinking  --  but she could not face what she knew had been in Claude 's mind . Morganna 's voice came twisted and dark through her tears , answering the sheriff 's questions . " . . . yes . . . a hired man of my husband 's . Yes . . . hired to survey and fence the northernmost boundary . " Dilly decided to go to the parlour . Her eyes could not help but go first to the murdered man under his white sheet . Mr. Parmenter 's broad back was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her hands in his . Claude was flung in a chair . Fox Parmenter , who had come with his father , sat beside him , his long legs stretched at an ungentlemanly length . " Did you not , " murmured the sheriff , " show unusual interest in your hired man by going to warn him yourself that Jed Towley and his fellows might make him trouble ? "  | " Oh , it was hardly for himself . . . " And Morganna 's eyes suddenly peeked . . . great friends . I felt to warn him was a kindness to her . " " Why did you not send the young maid ? " " She had gone to the common , sir . " " And he left for Worcester immediately ? " She shrugged indifferently . " I told him to . I 'm sure he did . " " This British soldier and Miss Lavander have an understandingbetween them ? " " Yes . ' T was love at first sight . They are to be married . I intended to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am very much pleased . They are both of them  --  in a way  --  proteges of mine . " Dilly 's eyes stiffened with amazement . She opened her mouth to contradict and thought better of it . Morganna was right . Better a few lies than the lady 's fair name rolled in muck . Then , too , it seemed the last kindness that could be done to the murdered man . Let him lie in dignity without the gossips licking their lips over scandal . Folk would pity General Milroy if they knew his wife had betrayed him . Dilly guessed how bitter such prurient pity would be to so arrogant a soul . Claude 's head came up out of his hands . He stared at his stepmother , his thoughts reflected upon his face . Is this really true ? Dilly and Alan Brann . . . and all the time I 've been thinking . . . No , I know they were lovers . But  --  my God  --  I can never prove it . Too late , he glanced at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Actually she was looking down , smirking a little  --  trying to blush  --  in fact looking exactly as young girls are supposed to look when their heart secrets are suddenly hauled out into the light . Oh , you minxp205. . he thought . You wait a bit . . . I 'll get it out of you . He was on his feet . " Sir , " he said . Mr. Parmenter swung about to face him . " There 's no harm in picking up Brann tonight . Mrs. Milroy says he left hours ago  --  and on foot . If we find him on the general 's horse I 'll say she has lied and Brann is guilty . For God 's sake , let 's get him before he is rid of that horse . " " Fox , my boy . . . " said the sheriff . There was a strangled cry from Mrs. Milroy . " What is this about a horse ? Oh , Claude . . . " Claude was standing before her , staring down at her , his clenched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you not understand that as well as a wallet a horse was stolen ? " " I did not understand . The general 's horse ? Oh , my God ! Claude , it ca n't be true . Quick , fetch me some brandy . " Dilly brought it from the dining room . " You say the horse the generalcame back from the inn on is stolen ? " Claude 's lips thinned , the lines in his cheeks ( where his father had had dimples ) deepened . " I protest , madame , " he said softly . " You are hard to follow . Seems the loss of a horse is a greater blow than the loss of a husband . " Morganna gave him an angry , bitter look and stalked out of the room . The sheriff 's pleasant voice addressed his son . " You go , Fox , my boy . Captain Claude had best stay here and comfort his mother 's grief . . . . Tell the Committee of Safety in Worcester I want that Alan Brann held for questioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tell ' em  --  " he took up the shattered old turnip watch from the table beside him  --  " tell them the general died almost to the moment at 10.36 , for the bullet bent the hands . Miss Dilly . . . " he bore down upon her . Now it was her turn to be comforted . " Do n't you go worry- ing your purty head about your feller . Just a routine matter , miss . " She responded to his comfort exactly as had Mrs. Milroya half hour earlier . She burst into tears . A more sensitive man might have felt he was not successful in comforting women . Dilly ran upstairs after Morganna , leaving the sheriff with one hand upraised ready to pat the air where a moment before the young girl had stood . " Well , " he said sympathetically , " looks like she feels purty bad . " Claude said , " Honest folk do feel pretty bad when they are put in an insufferable position . " " How 's that ? " " Nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yes , I have . Look you , I dare n't tell you here . I 'll go home with you and tell what I do believe . " The ladies were upstairs ; the servants in the kitchen ; Claude and the Parmenter men gone away , so the dead man lay alone . There was a dry little rat-tat-tat on the front door . No one heard and Mr. Merrifield cautiously entered . Parmenter had told him privately of the tragedy and now he came to be on hand if wished for . No one seemed to wish for him . He feared to intrude , so having knelt in prayer for a moment beside the dead man he started to leave as secretly as he had come . Then the French clock upon the mantel struck one o'clock . The latenessof the hour amazed him . He pulled out his own watch . The Milroy clock was wrong . It was only midnight . DILLY had sat for over an hour with Mrs. Milroy , trying to soothe her , get her into a mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , but her body was rigid , as though some fit was coming over her . Now and then she twitched . She was silent most of the time , but when she spoke it was in so incoherent a manner Dilly could make little sense of her words . Claude had been right about one thing . She seemed more concerned over the theft of a horse than the murder of her husband . And she was always talking about the time and what a good timepiece that parlour clock was and how General Milroy had given a captured officer of Von Reisdal 's a pair of shoes for the turnip watch and that Fox Parmenter had a watch , but left it at home and the sheriff had said he never needed to bother with a watch . The sun was good enough for him . She considered it the best of luck that the inquest was not to be held until morning . She fretted over who it was had taken the general 's wallet . Then in the middle of a sentence her voice grew inarticulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedding about her , for the night was growing cold , blew out the candle and left her . She went to her bedroom door and opened it . It smelt of spilled brandy and death . She had forgotten Hans and quickly closed the door again . Claude had left the house with Sheriff Parmenter . She did not know whether or not he had already returned to the spare room . The house was cold , for the hearths had been covered for hours . She decided to curl up in a great chair in the gen- ' eral 's office close by the hearth and get what sleep she might . She woke , and her first feeling was of cold , for the military cloak she had wrapped about herself had slipped to the floor . Then she heard a step upon the stairs , and she knew it was this step  --  and not the cold  --  which had awakened her . Someone , having stolen down the stair , was turning the knob of the par- lour door behind which lay the murdered man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widowed woman steal from her bed , thus creep to her husband 's dead body , pitying its loneliness ? Any other woman , but not Mrs. Milroy . Dilly stood looking from the doorway of the office across the hall into the parlour . Mrs. Milroy . . . the name formed upon her lips , but she did not say it . Mrs. Milroy looked little , shrunken , bent . Cold as the house was , she had on neither slippers nor dressing gown . Barefooted and in her night rail , her nightcap askew at a rakish and unbecoming angle on her disordered grey curls , she stood with her back to the sheeted corpse . She had opened the face of the clock upon the mantel and now she was closing it . Dilly knew she had witnessed something so secret that if Morganna knew she had seen her she would hate her . She slipped back into the office and stood a moment with hard-beating heart . Soon enough the bare feet crept up the stairs . She felt her confidence in Mrs. Milroy strangely shaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the clock really been Mrs. Milroy ? Mrs. Milroy always cared so much how she looked  --  even in bed and asleep . That woman in night rail and cap had not cared at all . She felt she must go to her immediately , hear her say again ( and know that she spoke the truth ) that neither she nor Alan Brann had anything to do with the death of the general . But when she reached the stair head , she knew she could not question her . Ever . She sat on the top stair . It will come out all right . Tomorrow . . . all right . Do as she says . . . do n't let anyone ever know that even for a moment you thought . . . A footpad . It will be all right . . . . She woke , feeling a hand upon her shoulder . " You 'll fall down the stairs and break your neck , " Claudep209whispered . Obviously he had just come in from outdoors . " Why are n't you in bed ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mine . " " Of course , and I never thought . You can have half of my bed for the little that 's left of the night . Poor kid  --  poor girl . You 've had a hard time . " He led her to the spare room . She could hardly keep her eyes open . She felt him kneel and take off her shoes . " Your feet are like blocks of ice , " and he held them in his palms and warmed them . " Do you want your dress off ? " " No , that 's all right . " Her eyes closed the second her head rested upon the pillow . She was chilled through and through . Claude slipped in beside her . He had taken off his boots and uniform coat . She was grateful for his warmth and the comfort of his arms about her . It was as if this silent sympathetic warmth was the real man . She forgot the ugly way he had told his stepmother not to worry about living too long and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they suspected . She was only conscious now of the compassion of his warm breath , the solidity of his arms in a reeling world . And she knew that he , like herself , was frightened . He was clinging to her for comfort even as she clung to him . Her last thought as she dropped off to sleep was , Oh , if Claude only would never talk . ALAN woke , barely in time to escape the angry hooves of the general 's white horse . His breath was coming hard . He was sure that he had cried out , for the horse had reared above him striking down at him with iron-clad hooves . He looked about him . Safe he was in a fine bed at Peabody 's in Worcester . The rearing revengeful horse had been a dream . He stretched himself  --  wasinstantly wide awake . Yes , his danger from the horse had been a dream  --  but danger enough yet remained . Without a doubt sometime he would be held for questioning . He had been questioned before  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to him : Morganna running to him with her news and her fears as he split rails close to Job 's Folly . Then till sunset time they had been happy together  --  so happy there had been no need to make love . It was as if ( for once ) they had risen to some new height beyond the power of the body to express , almost beyond the power of words . Sense and wisdom had both been lulled and he had committed the stupidity of letting himself be coerced by Morganna into returning to Milroy Mansion . The next few hours he could not face . The lovely innocent girl of the woods became ( with the fall of darkness and the closeness of four walls ) a hissing serpent coiling about him . Coiling and coiling , suffocating him . When at last he had left her with that well-oiled pistol in his hands he had hardly known what it was he would do . General Milroy 's face when he knew what Alan said was true . . Morganna 's face as she saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him with the general 's watch in her hands . . . bidding him be gone and " take a horse , " she had said . " Take any horse . . . " Without thinking , he had obeyed her . He had been outside his wits . The thud and surge of the white stallion galloping so willinglythrough alternate moonlight and darkness and the horror of the moment when he had realized that no one but a general would have such a charger , and his wits had returned to him.  |p211To  claim to have left an hour before the general 's death . . . and be found upon his horse ! He had immediately dismounted , tied the reins to the pommel , pulled the stirrups up the leathers , ever so little loosened the girths  --  for he was too well trained in the care of fine animals to be able to just turn the beast loose . He had headed the creature back towards Fayrely , told him to remember where he had had his last dinner and go get another one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He would not be abandoned . Alan had at last struck him , screamed at him in anger and fear for the horse seemed to be a white fiend of vengeance . He could not rid himself of the horse . Sometimes he thought it had gone for good , but he would hear the jingle of its bit and then see the glow of its whiteness . The damning , damnable horse would not let him escape . It was not until Leicester he finally shook him off only six miles from Worcester . In Leicester the village dogs ( as sometimes they will ) attacked the riderless horse . The creature had stood at bay for a moment , and with lifted head cried the wild challenge of the fighting stallion , but when Alan himself had sicked the dogs on him , had thrown the stone which cut the white satin breast , the gallant creature had turned tail and run . The last Alan had seen of him he was safely headed for Fayrely with the dogs of Leicester snapping at his heels . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but at least he would be near enough to suggest he had only wanderedaway after the general 's death . But no wonder it was this damning , damnable white fiend that had pursued him in his dreams . He reached out of bed and pulled the bell ring . The day was beginning , and he might as well have his breakfast sent up . He could smell coffee and sausages , and he was hungry forp212them . This Peabody 's was a well-run inn . And he certainly had made enough stir over the time last night . He had found Mrs. Peabody sitting in her wing chair . Never had he seen flesh so piled on flesh . And those black eyes under yellow hooded lids . " Your name , please ? " she had said . " I am called Alan Brann . " " Alan Brann ! I never forget a name . So here you are at last . ' T was last summer , my young master , a lady came huntingyou . . . did she ever catch up ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Morganna . Milroy . He had felt her as something inimicable to him , snapping at his heels as the dogs of Leicester had snapped at the white stallion . " And you do n't even know which lady it was , I warrant ! Fie upon you pretty gentlemen . Well , this was a red-headed one . Shy and mad she was . . . " Dilly Lavander . He had laughed boldly . " She caught up , ma'am . " He had had a novel picture of himself and Dilly Lavander living together as man and wife . Never had he picturedsuch wedded state with Morganna Milroy , nor with Dilly until that moment . As he had stood before Mrs. Peabody he felt free of Morganna . Light-heartedly he added , " Soon we will be wed . " Then she had asked him to drink a nightcap with her , and he had innocently claimed the hour too late . Past midnight he said , " No more midnight than I 'm sixteen , " the hostess claimed . Before the paltry matter had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Surely Alan had played his game well . It had been before i i.00 when he had arrived at Peabody 's . His thoughts were interrupted by a tap on his door , and a little maid no more than fifteen entered , carrying a tray . It wasp213exactly what he had wished . Coffee , toast , sausages . There had been no supper the night before , and he was ravenous . The servant pulled back his curtains and daylight streamed in . Coffee , toast , sausages , and such a pretty girl ! " What time is it ? " he questioned idly . The maid smiled . He noticed the little round arms , the innocent childlike expression . The grey eyes beamed at him unflinchingly as though no one and no experience ( as yet ) had told her it is dangerous for pretty maids to smile so broadly at young men in bed . " Nigh on ten , sir . " " I 've overslept . " " You have indeed , sir . What a slub-abed you are , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home ? " " I have n't any wife . " " Your mother then . " He thought of the fickle , wanton , irresponsiblegreat lady . He answered from his heart . " I really have n't any mother . " " Have n't you anything , sir ? " " Nothing . Not even a sweetheart . " Without thought he put out his arms to the stranger . Heart and body ached for her and the feeling elated him . For years he had wanted only Morganna Milroy . Well , he certainly had had her . And now this change in him . Last night he had been thinking of Dilly Lavander and now before he had eaten breakfast or got his breeches on he wanted the first girl he saw . He pulled her to him and kissed her . She did not speak or resist . Then at last , " Please let me go . Mrs. Peabody would n't like it . " He kissed her again lightly , respecting her youth . He now saw this was all he had really wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peabody 's right . So do n't let any other guest here ever kiss you . Only me . " " Yes , sir . " She was edging towards the door.  | " And fetch me up hot water for shaving and a razor too . . . . " " I 'll be right back . " The sun struck in under the canopies of his bed filling his eyes , his soul , his whole body with light , warmth , happiness . He smiled . Not for months had he felt so contented . At last he was free . But suddenly Morganna 's command came back to him , " Make love to a chambermaid . . . anything so they notice you . " That was exactly what he had done . Inadvertently he had obeyed her and he had a moment of bitter hostility against her . What was he ? Nothing but her puppet ? A soft slow knock upon his door . Of course the pretty maid . He turned his sunny smiling face to meet her . It was four armed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come . Only they had found him quicker than he had expected . " Alan Brann ? " " Yes . " " You are Alan Brann ? " " Yes . " The most grizzled of the four stepped to the edge of the bed . He placed a cold disinterested hand upon the rippling bare shoulder . " In the name of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts I pronounceyou under arrest . " BY noon the coroner and his jurymen had sat upon the body . They found : " Upon the twenty-sixth night of October , 1781 , General Milroy , returning unto his house in Fayrely , WorcesterCounty , from the Wolfe Tavern , nearing his own door , hadbeen feloniously assaulted by one or more person or personsp215to the jury unknown , shot once through the chest by his own pistol and being shot there did die , and his body robbed of some one thousand dollars and his white stallion valued at some eight hundred dollars was stolen away and his body was left to lie . This being done by person or persons to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be buried . Claude and the sheriff sat in the dead man 's office awaiting the findings of the coroner and his men . And here it was ! A crisp paper scrawled over with ink . Claude 's tired eyes could read but the one phrase , and that repeated twice over , " by person or persons unknown . " Neither he nor Parmenter spoke . They heard the coroner 's jury pass out of the house , mount their horses in the yard . Then Parmenter , standing by the window , turned and said , " Well ? " " Well , " said Claude . " In spite of what you think  --  feel , rather  --  it may well be that it was those two young vagabonds whom Tarbell testified watched your father pull out his wallet at the inn . They left soon after he did  --  perhaps they followed him . " " Perhaps . " " The Committee of Safety has taken charge of the hue and cry . Every suspicious character for miles about is being rounded up . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Claude  --  last night you told me you were sure your stepmotherand Brann were lovers and conspired to your father 's death . Are you now of the same mind ? " " I am . " " But , Claude , you yourself have admitted to me you 've seen nothing . Of course this Brann was much about , but he was courting Miss Lavander . And I did stop and question Catsey Millis this morning . She was often with them . Yes  --  it was Miss Lavander the young man was after . And Mrs. Milroy was much pleased thereby . Obviously she is too old to attract him . Do you think lovers could even exchange one glance and that Catsey not see it ? No . " " They are infernal shrewd . " " Or you infernal suspicious . " " I know . You 're right . I 've nothing to go by . But at least there are three people in this house who do know the truth . Three women . " " The slave ? " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . And she 'd lie her tongue out to protect Mrs. Milroy . " " And the lady herself  --  ? " " Of course . " The sheriff was staring absently out the window . " Whoa , there ! " he exclaimed . " Here 's my boy Fox . He 's leading the general 's horse . Now if Brann and the horse and the money were all found together . . . Hey , Fox  --  get Brann ? " " Yeap ! And he was in Worcester just about eleven o'clock last night . " He got off stiffly because of his bad leg and faced the two men that hurried out to meet him . " Sure ? " " Sure . Seems he went to Mrs. Peabody 's and laid a wager about the hour . There are four or five gentlemen ready to swear . " " Where 'd you find the white horse ? " " Only three miles out of Fayrely  --  down along Worcester Road . Farmer 's back yard . " Claude had Paris by the bits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Fox . Did you pull those stirrups up the leathers and loosen the girths ? " " Why , no . . . I never thought . " " Did you knot the reins to the pommel ? " " Not I. " " The farmer ? " " No . Horse so scared the farmer could n't go near him . " So , thought Claude , the murderer started out on Paris . Rode him furiously ( for the beast 's done in ) and abandoned him . But he knew enough about the care of valuable animals to instinctively do the right thing . No footpad ( that Madame might have hired to do this deed for her ) , a good horseman . British officers are said to care more for their horses than their men . Alan Brann . . . No ... Alan Brann was in Worcester within twenty minutes of the time the murderer 's bullet stopped the watch ... and his father 's heart . For there could be no doubt but the time of the general 's death was known almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barn and unsaddled him . Absentmindedlyhe curried away the sweat that had dried on him , noted the gash cut on the satin breast , a jagged tear upon one hock  --  almost like marks of a beast 's teeth . Paris was nervous and suspicious . When Claude wiped his face for him he snorted and jumped back . " Whoever rode you abused - you , " said Claude . " There , poor fellow , eat your mash . Here 's hay for you . He sat on the edge of a grain chest , his fingers idly burying themselves in the dusty silk of oats . This horse knew all . And what good did that do ? But there were Mrs. Milroy , Dilly , and I'hillis . Mrs. Milroy , Dilly and Phillis .. . Mrs. Milroy had been treated this morning ( even as Parmenterhad treated her the night before ) as a bereaved woman  --  not a suspected criminal . Not one thing had come out against her . Not a suspicion that she and Brann were lovers . Yet to Claude she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young man 's fate , who was at least something of a protege of hers . He saw that the jury of inquest ( neighbours all ) never could doubt her virtue . How could anyone doubt Morganna Milroy ? How could he ? Her reputation was impeccable . Cold , proud , above sudden weaknesses of the flesh . Then it occurred to him that the lady had never had any experience in falling in love  --  and out again . How old was she now ? Thirtytwoor - three . Suppose you reach some such age and had never loved until then . Did it not stand to reason you 'd behave worse than if you 'd been falling in and out of love nigh on twenty years ? ' T is not ( he saw ) your light amorist who goes mad with love . It is people  --  well , like Morganna Milroy . But she must have hammered and hammered upon Brann . Brann . . . You could never tell a thing about a fellow like that . Something secret and unsubstantial about him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faugh ! He hated all this new talk out of France . Romantic . Rousseau . Oh , let a man be a man ! Not a God-damned ( what was it Catsey called him ? ) " stag at bay . " Oh , yes , women are such fools they always love the Brann sort of fellow . Dilly , now . It was possible of course that she was in love with him . No , she was not . Perhaps he himself was jealous of Brann 's charm for women . . . as men without romantic appeal are always jealous of those that have it . He went back to the house where the sheriff awaited him . " Parmenter , let 's begin with Phillis . We 'll accuse her of having stolen the money ( which I doubt , but she 's a known thief ) and scare her enough to get something out of her . I 'll get her . " He fetched Phillis into the office but inadvertently Mrs.p219Milroy came too . Morganna sat herself quickly  --  not at all as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wish to keep gentlemen standing and bowing . Behind her back Parmenterraised a quizzical eyebrow , but Claude indicated the woman was to be allowed to remain . " Phillis , " the sheriff began , noticing the slave 's greying cheeks and rolling eye . " I have come to believe you know more than you 've told us . " " I knows notting , no , sah . First I hears ob dis matter Miss Dilly she come in like she seen a ghostie . Says general lying out der ' fore de barn door . He done it afore  --  fell off he 's horse when in he 's cups . " " What time was this ? " " Time afore ? " " No , this time . Time Miss Dilly found him ? " " I know just about exactly . For first ting Mrs. Milroy thinks of is what time ' t is . And Miss Dilly she run to de parlour to look at de clock . ' Lebben-fifteen , she say . " " But , " said Claude , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the Wolfe . There 's something funny about the time . . . . " " You ca n't read time yourself , Phillis ? " asked the sheriff . " Who , me , sah ? No , sah . " " So we 've only Miss Dilly and Mrs. Milroy 's word for it ? " " Dat 's all , sah . " If Parmenter had hoped to get some expression of concern from Mrs. Milroy he failed . She sat quiet and indolent in her chair , seemingly a little bored . " Phillis , we believe robbery is the bottom of this crime . " Mrs. Milroy 's face showed no sign of relief . " Yes , sah. "  | " And looks to me you are the robber . " Phillis 's grey cheeks relaxed , formed bags upon the jawbones . " Do n't say dat . " Now Mrs. Milroy was aroused . Her neck began to lengthen , carrying the head with it . There was something evil , reptilian about this lengthening neck . " If Phillis has stolen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Sheriff . " Her voice was metallic . " Last summer she stole from me three silver spoons . Phillis has always been a thief . But oh , I never thought she 'd do so dastardly a thing . Kill for money . Murder the kindest master a slave ever had . Why , she 'll hang on both accounts . And you need not hunt further . " " Where did she hide the spoons , ma'am ? " " In the ticking of her bed . " " I 'll look . " " No , I 'll look . " The slave was grinning in relief . Claude broke out , " Oh , look at her smug face ! No need to hunt the ticking ! " " I nebber , nebber stole any money , sahs . " " We believe you did . And when we 've found the money , chance is we 've found the murderer  --  ay , Claude ? " " You 're right . " " Come on . Tell us the truth . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen the woman 's hands go nervously to the square of bright calico tied about her head . " When first she came to live here she stole fish hooks of mine and hid them in her turban . Take it off , woman . " " Do n't axe me to . Please . I ca n't take off mah turban . Ah nebber takes it off . I'se bald , sir . Do n't shame me so . " Mrs. Milroy was rubbing her little hands together . " She did it . She shot and robbed General Milroy. "  |p221Claude  put his hand on the turban and the slave 's protests rose to a scream . " No , no , mastah captain . . . Mrs. Milroy ! Do n't you dare let dat Claude touch me . . . . Mrs. Milroy . " Her mistress was smiling . " That 's where the money is . .. . " " Mrs. Milroy ... If you do n't stop ' em I 'll get even with you . " The lady accepted the threat with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am , " said Claude . Out of the yards of calico tumbled a leathern wallet . He opened it . One hundred , two . . . three hundred . Yes  --  just about a thousand . " Oh , Phillis , " cried Mrs. Milroy . " You wicked creature ! So it was you who murdered your kind master . . . for the sake of this filthy Continental money ! You viper ! Well , sirs "  --  and she turned to the officer and Claude  --  " at least there will be no need for further hunt . Here 's our gallows bird ! " The slave , her black wool now released from its turban rising for a foot over her head , stared stolidly at her mistress . She whispered , " You say dat to me  --  mistress ? " " Well  --  to who else ? " The woman folded her arms upon her chest , stood for a moment silent and magnificent . She spoke at last in a low voice . " Now I'se ready to tell de truf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hear General lying out deah by de well , I goes myself to see what 's up . I touch him and I see he gone dead .

If you folks had asked for de wallet I 'd aknown what ' t is you'se talking : about . You talked about money . I had n't seen none . All I see 's de wallet . " Morganna cried out , " I tell you that woman 's a thief . She 'd steal anything and seems she 'd murder as well . "  | " I nebber stole money all mah life !

" For a moment Claude had thought he had an eyewitness . " But , " said the slave , and her voice sank to a whisper . " Dey bloodied der clothes . " " What ? " Morganna 's face was chalk-white . Even her lips were white . " Dey burn up Mistress ' bloody shoes on her hearth upstairs and dey burned Mr. Brann 's shirt on de parlour hearth .

" " I hid ' em away good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hid ' em good  --  for I nebber thinks she 'd turn on me . " Mrs. Milroy 's eyes blazed in the midst of her white face . " Silence , Phillis .

" It was too late now for Mrs. Milroy to conciliate the enraged Negress , but she tried . " Phillis . . . you silly girl ! I never turned on you . Why , I wo n't let anyone hurt you . I never thought you meant to keep the money . You know that old shirt of Mr. Brann 's was used for . . . polishing the brass andirons  - -  - and then burned up . You must not say such wicked things . "  | " Yes 'm . I cleaned out de hearths two days back . Were n't no shirt deah den . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " cried Mrs. Milroy . " A slave ca n't bear witness . The truth is , Claude , I did burn up my slippers last night . They were old ones  --  of purple cloth . And I got paint on them that afternoon . " " Dey was yer new ones , ma'am . Green ones . Mr. Sullivan makes for you just last spring . " " That 's easily proved , " said Parmenter . " Madame , you are to show us the green ones  --  and the pot of paint . But first of all , Claude , let 's get to the cellar and see Phillis 's spoils . " " I think , " said Mrs. Milroy with difficulty , " I 'll stay here . I , at least , am not taken in by a slave 's lies and spite . " When the two men came back from the cellar they found that Dilly had joined Mrs. Milroy . The women sat side by side  --  two blank white faces . " Dilly , " said Claude . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were dark stains on it , doubtless blood . She swallowed and answered mechanically with the words Mrs. Milroy had taught her while the men were down cellar . " Yes . Mr. Brann 's shirt . I used it for polishing brass two days ago . I burned it up . " " These slippers ? " She stared at the charred soles  --  that was all that was left . " I do n't know for certain . " " Yesterday afternoon did Mrs. Milroy get paint on her slippers ? " " Yes . " " How did she ?

" Claude said , " Madame , will you please to tell us what dress it was you wore last night ? " " My grey paragon . " Dilly 's teeth clenched . She remembered the maroon glace glowing and rustling about Morganna Milroy as the woman paced the parlour in a frenzy waiting the arrival of the general . Only later , when Claude had fetched her out of bed to meet the sheriff , had she put on the watered paragon . It was characteristicof Claude not to have noticed , but Phillis " Is this the truth ? " " Yes , " Dilly admitted in a miserable voice . " Phillis ? " The slave scratched her head . She answered honestly , " Ah did n't help her dress . No , sah . Seems like it was the grey she had on . I done forget . Yes , sah . I seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will you please fetch it down ? " Dilly ran upstairs and looked in Madame 's closet . There was not a stain on the paragon . Involuntarily , against her will , she glanced at the hook were the maroon glace should be hanging . The hook was empty . When she came back to the office all except Parmenter were standing in silence . The only sound came from the scratching of Parmenter 's pen . He was sitting at General Milroy 's desk . Ile sifted sand over what he had written , then got up and walked three steps to Morganna . His heavy hand grasped her shoulder . She whirled about . Quietly he began to read . It was the warrant of Morganna Milroy 's arrest under suspicion of her husband 's death . She was to be taken immediately to Worcester for examination before a justice of the peace . The silence was heavy when he had done . He folded the paper and thrust it in his pocket . " I 'm sorry , madame , " he said and his voice caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not hold you for examination , and Miss Dilly and you too , Claude , Frost , Phillis . There 's a dozen of you must appear in Worcester for examination  --  day after tomorrow . " The woman hid her face in her hands and wept . " Madame , we will start in an hour . Take little with you . . . a small trunk and . . . " It was curious that even at such a moment he had a blind instinct to protect her . " If I were you I 'd take but sober raiment  --  such as is best suited to your widowed state . And ' t is no hardship to spend a few nights at Joy 's . There 's an upper chamber . . . " She lifted her head . " I know . . . barred . " " Yes . And with all my heart I hope in three days ' time you will be back here amongst us all , your good name cleared forever . " " Oh , that will be easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that lying Phillis  --  even if she does belong to Claude . How she must have hated me all these years . As if I were ever the woman to . . . to chase about after anybody as she says I have . Especially Miss Lavander 's affianced man . " Both men thought ( but were too courteous to say ) that although it might be Phillis 's " lies " that had supplied a motive , it was the burned clothing which suggested guilt . Dilly was so pale her freckles stood out like pepper over the bridge of her nose , but she moved and spoke with quietp227courage . She packed the clothes Mrs. Milroy asked for and some of her own as well . Claude found her kneeling on the floor of his bedroom thrusting a night rail into a little bag . Without looking up at him she brushed the tears from her cheeks and went on with her work . " No , no , " said Claude . " You are n't wanted until day after tomorrow . " " I am going.with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a desperate look come into her eyes . She was afraid that he would get the truth out of her . She quickly averted her head , and he was sorry for her . Hardly more than a child and already up to her ears in perjury . An honest child by nature . " I must go with her . " " Very well . Have you money ? " His face was sober , compassionate , hostile , brooding . He felt himself powerless against the spell Morganna had cast over the young girl . " No . " He gave her some . THE sheriff 's chaise jogged into Worcester and Dilly realized that their news had mysteriously preceded them . Mrs. Milroy was to be examined under suspicion of her husband 's death . She heard a child 's shrill voice , " That 's her . " Men rolling barrels from an ox-dray into a merchant 's cellar stopped their work , spoke to one another , and immediately a spectacled face appeared in the office window . Other eyes at other windows . Everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it please you , sir , will you not stop a moment at Mrs. Peabody 's ? I have tried her syllabubs before and found them good . " Mr. Parmenterp228glanced cautiously at the crowd that was unmistakably followingthem , cleared his throat and did as asked . A potboy in shining apron appeared at the wheel . " A syllabubfor the lady . Would you be wishing for one too , miss ? " " No  --  no . Thank you . " " And mind , " said Morganna , " that you beat and spice it well . It must be rich and creamy . " In amazement Dilly heard the very words of last summer . That day seemed to have been but a rehearsal for today . Any moment now Mrs. Milroy would again be bidding her hunt about and bring her word of Alan Brann . Men stared at Mrs. Milroy with silly mouths agape . Men always stared at her , but covertly  --  sidewise , complimenting her beauty . Now they insulted her with avid gluey glances . Stable men in blue smocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were arriving on the run . A torrent of eyes and a sibilant whisper , " That 's her . " Mrs. Milroy nonchalantly drained her thick drink to the last drop and felt for her purse . " Oh , no , " objected the sheriff . " Permit me . " " No , really , Mr. Parmenter . " They argued and Mrs. Milroy graciously gave in . She was not the woman to pay for her own refreshment when escorted by a gentleman  --  even if that gentleman was the sheriff , and she herself his prisoner . Good social usage . . . There was a knot of excited maidservants . One voice from the middle of the knot rang out clearly , " The Committee of Safety came here this morning and caught him . My , but he is the handsome lad . .. " No one had told either Morganna or Dilly that Alan Brann had already been taken up . Morganna raised her head , her lips parted.  | " Hush . " the sheriff warned . " Do not ask . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they refer . Dilly , I believe this matter is closer to your heart than mine . . . . " " Do n't you go asking either , miss , " the sheriff commanded roughly . He turned his horse down the Post Road , which was the main street of the county seat . Dilly heard the name of the general over and over , and twice Alan Brann 's . And more than once exclamations of pity for the " poor lady . " The crowd was curious , but in no way hostile . It had not condemned Mrs. Milroy as guilty . About Mr. Joy 's was another knot of people . Some enterprisingshopkeeper had estimated the crowd great enough for profit . A rat-faced urchin , barefooted in spite of the October cold , had a basket-tray suspended from his neck by a strap . He was chanting , " Hot spiced gingerbreads . Two the penny ! " Mr. Parmenter stopped his chaise and stepped out . Then he turned to help the lady . The door of the inn opened . Standing bareheaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stricken face . " That 's him , " murmured the crowd . Morganna had stretched out one foot to the mounting block , one hand to the sheriff . Half in and half out of the chaise was she . She lifted her head and she saw Alan Brann on the steps before her . Their eyes met . Dilly could not see the lady 's face  --  but she saw Alan Brann 's . His lips tightened in recognition . A flush mottled his face . She noted his confusion  --  embarrassment and then instantlyhis eyes were averted . But before he averted his eyes she had seen something  --  but oh , what was it ? Hate , love , fear , devotion ? It had been none of these things , nothing but a " look , " which had come quickly and gone more quickly even , a flash of something  --  and then his face was turned away.  | Mrs. Milroy had drawn back into the chaise , sitting bolt upright , her gloved hands in her lap ; her lids hid her eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are they taking him ? " " Next door to county jail . " " And I ? " " You 'll stay here , ma'am . " " In that upper chamber ? " " Yes . " " And my examination ? " " Immediately . The justice has just finished with Mr. Brann . But the witnesses of Fayrely wo n't be examined until day after tomorrow . " " I see . And then we can all go home ? " " God grant it , ma'am . " Mr. Joy , who was both jailor and innkeeper , came to meet them . His manner reflected his dual role in life . The hand he laid upon the lady 's elbow was all jailor , but his smile was that of the hearty host . He ordered a boy to fetch in the lady 's trunk in one capacity and told Mrs. Milroy that the justice was ready for her in the back parlour in his other . " Dilly , " Mrs. Milroy murmured in her ear , " you know what you are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last summer . Find out . . . bring me word . " " Yes . " Dilly must learn how serious were the charges against Alan Brann . She took off the hat she had worn and pulled over her head the dark hood of her cloak . She hoped no one now would recognize her . She went first to Mr. Salisbury 's shop and bought a split basket such as a lady might carry marketing . Now what would a housewife be apt to buy for her family in October ? " A pound of raisins , " she said . The shopkeeper 's shrewd glance took inp231the velvet lining to her hood and the velvet gloves . " Yes , miss . . . the best quality , I suppose ? We 've got three kinds . " " I 'd like to see all three . . . . " The gingerbread boy came in to replenish his stock . It was the angle of his teeth and the beadiness of his eyes that suggested the rodent . " They 're goin ' good , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Crowd still around joy 's ? " " Yeap , and there will be until justice Forbush has finished off with the lady . " He spoke with authority . Dilly examined the raisins . The worst of them were scummed over  --  wormy . She wrinkled her nose in distaste , but only a year ago what a feast even wormy raisins would have seemed to her . " Now these , miss , are the ones we sell most for cooking . Small and sweet and clean . While these here are finest Spanish dessert raisins . " She hesitated and took a pound of the middle grade . The shopkeeper , utterly oblivious to the excitement which made the girl swallow and swallow again , her heart race and her hands unsure , approved of her choice . " You 'll make a good careful wife for somebody one of these days , miss . " But what in the name of heaven might she buy next ? She was sure that at this shop next door to joy 's she would be apt to hear gossip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bluff old man came in asking why the rum his wife had ordered had not been delivered and did the shopkeeper know that that Englishfellow they picked up at Peabody 's this morning was cleared all right . " Seems he was in Worcester all the time , and by thunder ! If they have n't now dragged General Milroy 's poor wife into this . Not a thing against her except of course her father was a damned Tory  --  and she 's another . I tell you this badgering of Tories has gotter stop . I 'm as good a patriot as any man . Been on Committee of Safety two years , Committee of Correspondence , General Court , but it makes my blood boil to see an innocent lovely gentlewoman accused of her husband'sdeath just because she happens to be a Tory ! " " And four sweet pippins , " Dilly said stiffly . " Yes , ma'am . " She turned to the red-faced , white-haired old man . " What has happened , sir ? I saw a stir all up along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Milroy was shot dead last night in his own back yard . Out in Fayrely . " " You mean the General Milroy ? " " The very one . And as good a soldier as ever lived and as good a patriot . Why , I knew Arn Milroy 's father before him . Word came early this morning that we was to examine one Alan Brann . Seems he was some sort of hired man out there  --  an erstwhile British soldier to boot . But he was in Worcester at Mrs. Peabody 's just about the time of the shooting . That lets him out ! " " And the lady in the chaise ? " " Why , that 's the general 's widow . If that fool of a country deputy has n't got her in tow . How 'd you feel , Mr. Salisbury , if some thief ( for there 's robbery too ) shot you and before your body was buried they had Mrs. Salisbury up on suspi-cion ? " " Probably I 'd feel dead . " " Well , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They say that poor lady does n't do anything but weep . And can you blame her ? A lady of her station . I tell you I 'm as good a democratas any of them , but when I was a young man ladies were n't subjected to treatment like that just because a country deputy sheriff has an idea . . . "  |p233The  gingerbread boy had filled his tray , but still he loitered about . His eyes were fastened upon Dilly . Mr. Salisbury said , " Her father was kin of the Blairs . Old Judge Blair . He ought to be notified his relative 's in trouble . " " Yes , joy sent for him , but justice Forbush has n't let her see him yet . " " Has she other friends ? . .. " " Well , " said the gingerbread boy , " there was a lady that rode into Worcester with her . I saw her . She had red hair and a hat on her head . A beaver hat . With a hood on she looks different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like a pound of biscuits . " As soon as she had paid for them she left the shop . The gingerbreadboy watched her . She went to Jones 's tavern and ate a bowl of klabber , cream and maple sugar . Luckily the kitchen was the warmest room in the house and she sat with the gossiping servants . They talked of nothing but the murder of General Milroy . Seems two boys had done it . And stolen i 8,000 dollars . And she heard other stories of highwaymen and murder . Mrs. Milroy had been taken into Worcester merely to describe what vagabonds she had seen hanging about of late . But an old woman kneeling stiffly upon the hearth to baste a goose said , No . She had seen TTrs . Milroy setting in her chaise once , four years back , and if ever she had seen a woman who might murder her husband it was that woman . She had a hard face ( beautiful , I grant you , if you like such finicky stuff ) . Why , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face of Lilith , . and , " I 'll lay a wager with any of you that she did it , and she 'll hang . " The short day was ending and Dilly , frightened by the old woman 's cruel face and toothless mumbles , paid her reckoning , picked up her basket , and went to Joy 's . It was here that shep234herself would sleep the night . The crowd was disappearing a little . " She wept all the time , " she overheard said . " Mr. Forbushgot nothing from her . " " She says her slave did it . " " But she did burn her slippers  --  they were blood-soaked . " " I know she done it . " " Nonsense , she had n't any reason . " " Women do n't need a reason . . . . " Someone nudged her and she turned knowing that she had been recognized . " Hot spiced gingerbread  --  two the penny , " the boy said firmly . She did not dare refuse to buy . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head and she followed him out of the crowd . " Better take six . " " I 'll take six . " " I guess you want to know what 's happening ? " " Yes , I do . " " Well , Justice Forbush would n't let anybody ' cept officers in the back parlour , but Jacob Wheeler and me we climbed upon the roof of the coach house and we saw it all and heard some . The lady certainly was bawling . They had a doctor for her , but she could n't stop . And Mr. Forbush he felt so bad he was most bawling too . They was a pair of them ! And he asks her at last to please stay on at joy 's till day after tomorrow  --  and she says , Behind bars ? ' and he says oh , no , just any room she fancies . And that fat old sheriff from Fayrely is all of a sweat ' cause Mr. Forbush thinks he was just a mite previous in gettingout a warrant . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all . " " All twelve ? " " Yes . " " Where are you staying , lady ? "  | " Here at joy 's . " " I 'll keep an eye open and report to you what I find out . But you gotter buy gingerbread . " " I will  --  look here  --  Do you want this basket of raisins and pippins and things ? " " Say . . . Do I want it ? Good-bye , miss , and I 'll be seeing you again right soon . " The rat scurried away . AS soon as she asked , she was shown to Mrs. Milroy . Candles were lit in the lady 's room . A fire burned on the hearth . Morgannasat in a low chair . Her feet , clad only in silk stockings , were stretched towards the fire . She raised her face and smiled a tired smile . " Oh , Dilly .. . I 'm so glad you have come and I 've engageda room for you down the corridor a little way . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But there ! It relaxes one to be as tired as I be . I think I shall sleep well . But I could n't rouse myself enough to comb my hair and unlace my stays . The servant offered , but I can not endure red-faced sweaty wenches about me . Yes . . . unhook my gown , and what confusion has come over my head ! I declare it looks as rumpled as did Catsey Millis 's on the night of our ball . . . you remember our ball ? I 've been sitting here thinking about it . Yes . We danced . I remember . .. it was a minuet . " Her voice sank and her lids closed . She aroused herself from her reverie with a slight effort . " I was not given a moment after that long drive from Fayrely to refreshand order myself . I was taken immediately before Mr. Forbush . Now he , Dilly , is a gentleman of parts  --  of under-standing . " Dilly had heard several speak of the great flow of tears thatAp236had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . almost sweeping away his judgment . Morganna 's face was weary but unmarked . Yet as Dilly took off the soft dull silk dress and laid it upon the bed she found the square neck was actually wet . And in the pocket were two soaked handkerchiefs . There was the dainty little one of her own and another , very large and coarse , undoubtedly lent by Mr. Forbush or some other sympatheticofficer . Where do such tears come from ? And ( looking at the composed face ) where do they go to ? Seemingly tears by the gill , pint and quart had streamed from those clear unreddenedeyes . They had come from nowhere and gone nowhere  --  and they meant nothing . " This room "  --  and Morganna looked about her with a shrug  --  " is not a bad room . It 's perfectly clean . I 've looked everywhere . Of course it is not elegant  --  like Frean 's in Boston . Did I ever tell you that Father and I once stayed a month at Frean 's ? Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But how did matters go ? " " At Frean 's . . . ? " " No , no  --  today . " " Oh , it could not have gone better . Alan and I are still held , but for the merest matter of form . There 's not the least suspicion . They want to question us further about vagabonds we 've seen about . Now , Dilly , be you pleased to remember ! A month ago there were two short and swarthy men  --  foreigners , doubtless . Perhaps deserters from the French . Very evil . I am sure now that it means nothing that the money was found upon Phillis . You see  --  the person who shot General Milroy took fright and ran and the wallet fell to the ground . And Phillis picked it up . And by the way , Dilly . . . you are to assure Phillis of my love and regard . Tell her if all turns out well I will give her her freedom and set her up with a little grog shopp237and  --  Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not think the Negress an accomplice . . . do you ? " Dilly flung down the brush and sat abruptly . " I do n't know what to think any more . Oh , Mrs. Milroy . . . if only you would tell the truth . I know it would all be clear . I hated to say that Alan Brann and I were lovers . I hated to say I used his shirt for polishing brass  --  and burned it up . For I did n't and you know it and I know it . . . and I feel sure that soon enough Claude will know it . And you did n't get paint on your shoes . And there were n't any French deserters about Fayrely last month . . . . Oh , I beg of you , tell the truth  --  before it is too late . " Mrs. Milroy stared at the girl . Her face was set , obstinate She said bitterly , " The truth . . . who would believe the truth ! " She sighed and her hands plucked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Dilly took the brush and went on brushing the powder from her hair . She took long strokes and counted every one to keep from thinking . The lady sat . with closed lids . Her bosom rose and fell above her high stays .. At last Dilly believed she slept and turned to unpack the little trunk . " Dilly , " the woman said slowly . " I can not explain . . . even to you what it was that really happened , but I will swear to you  --  once more and by the name of God , that both Alan and I are innocent of the general 's death . But if I told exactly what happened  --  exactly what the truth was  --  no one would believe me . I honestly fear both he and I would hang for a crime we never committed . Look me square in the face  --  do you believe me ? For if you can not I will forgive you . Do you be-lieve ? " " I do . " " I must trust to red herrings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never question you again , Mrs. Milroy . I 'll do and say anything you ask of me . " " That reminds me . " Her voice suddenly became animated . " Mr. Parmenter was wrong . Wrong about the clothes . I want you to go back to Fayrely tomorrow and fetch to me next day all these things I have writ out upon this list . That was what I was doing as I waited for you to come to me . " " But , Mrs. Milroy , wo n't you . . . wo n't all of us be going home again day after tomorrow ? " " Somehow . . . I 'm not too sure . I do n't want to be disappointed . Phillis and . . . Claude . Perhaps Phillis will destroyherself by saying too much . I do n't know . Anyone can see she speaks from spite . But Claude . . . I fear him and I hate him . " She pressed her handkerchief to her lips and continued , " Would God he had died in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge Blair , has already come to me . He says he believes a slave can give testimony in court . He says he is not sure , but he will look it up . " " If it comes to a trial , will he defend you and Alan ? " " No , Dilly . He says he 's too old and as an erstwhile officer of the crown it would be harmful to me in the eyes of the jurymen . He says he will advise me . But he ca n't advise me ! No one can . I can only do as seems best to me . And I am so alone ! " Dilly knelt and put both arms about the woman . " There 's me , " she murmured , " and Alan Brann . " Morganna whispered the name . " Alan Brann . . . Dilly , you must go to him . See him alone . Tell him , tell him . . . " " I know . . . the French deserters ? " The woman moved impatiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . " " Yes . "  | " Tell him I love him . That I always will . Up to the grave and beyond I will love him . . . . I was a woman without life and without soul . And he came to me and he is my life and my soul . He is my God , my heaven  --  and my hell . Oh , Dilly , do you remember how I used to mock at Catsey because she loved Claude ? Pooh ! I thought you can choose whom you love even as you choose the colour of your frock . Dilly , you can not choose . I know now . But that 's not what I had in mind for you to tell Alan . Look ye . If they set him free ( and I believe they will , for they know he was in Worcester when the shot was fired . Oh , I swear he shall go free ) tell him . . . if he so wishes , he is to go away and never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her voice broke . " I will tell him . " Dilly was in tears . DILLY loathed to enter the Milroy Mansion where now Claude and Phillis ruled alone . Of these two enemies she preferred to face the slave , so she went to the kitchen door . The kitchen was empty and the hearth cold . The confusion was unspeakable . Surely this was Phillis 's declaration of independ-ence ! Spilled grease . Potato parings in the sink . A dirty hair brush thrown down on top of soiled silver . She averted her eyes and went quickly through the kitchen into the front of the house . The parlour door was open and thus she knew General Milroy 's body had been taken up and buried . But she could not resist a morbid desire to peer in at the satin sofa where his body had rested . The yellow upholstery was spotted with dried blood . Never would it do for Mrs. Milroy to come home and find those stains . Somehow Dilly must re-cover the sofa.  | She heard a murmur of voices outside the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . A group of men and women had stopped to stare lugubriously . Bits of black were tied to arms and hats . Obviously mourners just come from a country funeral . Undoubtedly it was from the general 's . A man was pointing at the house , pointing at the well , the barn  --  telling the story of Arnold Milroy 's death . He was animated ,  --  gesturing , and she guessed how for generation unto generationfolk yet unborn would come to this very spot , stand , and tell this story . And it would change in time , she knew . It would become a legend . And the pain of it would be lost and nothing but the legend would be left . Dusty word added to dusty word , thus would grow the edifice and thus the truth and the agony would be buried while folk pointed and told their tale . She went to her own room . Now at last she had time to wonder what had happened to Hans . They had taken him away the morning after the murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor did she care and yet in normal times it would have concerned her much . She remembered how she had hoped to ask Hans more concerning Captain Sparrow and how he had come to die . Now she 'd never know  --  nor really care . Ah , well . . . if ( as she believed ) the general 's funeral was this afternoon soon enough Phillis and Claude would both be coming home from the burying ground behind the meetinghouse . Oh , why , why , why had Mrs. Milroy sent her back . . . turned her over to Claude ? And all for the sake of a few foolish dresses . I 'll see to it I 'm not one moment alone with Claude . I 'll say I have a headache and go to bed . No . He 'd know I was copying Mrs. Milroy . He would n't believe me . He 'd get me up out of bed  --  and make me talk . At least she might as well start to pack up Mrs. Milroy'sp241things as sitting here amooning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began to read from Mrs. Milroy'slist . " My French damask stays . " She found them . " Green plush dressing gown . " " Sprigged lawn short-frock and the quilted mauve lutestringpetticoat I wear under it . " " The white silk stockings with scarlet clocks and the scarletheeledslippers to match . " " My silver looking glass . . . a sack of finest starch-pow-der . " The slight exertion of finding and packing relaxed her and she began to sing under her breath  --  then stopped short . It was the " Battle of the Kegs " she sang . Mrs. Milroy had been furiousthat that song had been sung under her roof . " My cambric bedgown , " she read from the list aloud and unconsciously her voice had mimicked Mrs. Milroy 's . It was always thus with haste and pride Mrs. Milroy mentioned her possessions . She heard her own voice echo back to her the very tones of Mrs. Milroy . The sound sickened her , and she sat upon the bed . The scarlet-heeled slippers fell from her fingers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never more ring out through this white room  --  never would she come to this room , this house  --  never to Fayrely  --  never sit in yonderfaded wing-chair in half-stays and petticoats , pull back the crisp white curtains and fret at the weather  --  never sit before yon looking glass  --  never lie upon this stately bed . Already she was gone . " Morganna . . . Morganna . . . " she whispered , trying to summon her back from the morass she felt her sinking into . " Morganna Milroy . " The beating of her heart was her only answer.  | Until this moment she had followed the lady 's lead blindly , not daring to stop and think . She had said what she had been told . She and Alan Brann were lovers and hoped soon to marry . But she had really known the truth that night of the ball when she had seen the two stand up to dance , had seen the silver of Mrs. Milroy 's head gleaming in moonlight and Alan 's blond head bending to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took Mr. Brann 's shirt to polish the brass andirons  --  and I burned it up . " But she could hear Mrs. Milroy 's voice last June telling her that although a lady might polish silver she must never polish brass  --  that was the slave-woman 's work . Not once since had she polished brass . Mrs. Milroy had not gone to the tool shed that afternoon they had raked the dry leaves . Dilly had , and it was true there was paint about the shed  --  and thanks be to God  --  the paint had been dark . There were dark stains upon the soles of her charred shoes . Some truth , and the rest lies . She had not seen a pair of dark and foreign men hanging around the house a month ago  --  " doubtless deserters from the French . " Why had Mrs. Milroy made them so conspicuous ? Why not two more ordinary tramps ? And the fact was someone had murdered General Milroy . That was the truth . Alan Brann had been in Worcester at the time . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady sworn to her own and her paramour'sinnocence . And Dilly knew that she had not lied . This was as basic a fact as was the general 's death . After the things upon the list had been packed , she went quietly about the room straightening it . The white muslin bedrobeand the fluted bedcap she flung aside to be washed . She rearranged the closet , hanging silk dresses at one end and cot/ton at the other . I must get camphor and cedar chips for the wools and furs , she thought . She felt sad and lonely in the presence of these inanimate things . And sometime  --  long ago  --  had she not once done all this before ? Six years ago word had come from Ticonderoga and she , a maid of only ten , had followed her mother about watching her pack away her father 's things . She remembered the sudden tears in her mother 's eyes at the sight of worn shoes  --  now laid away until one of the boys was big enough to wear them . She remembered her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homespun jacket ( so Dilly 's fingers now touched a silken fold ) . It is thus  --  and no other way  --  from the begining of time unto the end that women have gone and always will go to the rooms of those they have loved and lost and pack away their things . She left the haunted chamber and went again to her own room . But out of her window She could see another knot of people  --  avidsightseers poring upon the very spot twixt barn and well where a general had died . They felt they had the right to enter the gates , to stand thus . Now it was not alone the sheriff and his men who might come as it pleased them but any curiouslyminded gossip . This secluded residence did not now belong to the Milroys but to the world . It was not only the law and its dignity that was upon them , but the indignity of vulgar curiosity which the world over follows close upon the heels of the law . It was long past suppertime when Claude came home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly the worse for drink . He showed neither surprise nor interest that Dilly was back again , for upon the wings of liquor he had momentarily escaped his problems  --  his father 's murder , his suspicions of his stepmother , Dilly 's untruthfulness . Tonight nothing could hurt nor touch him and seemingly he wished to hurt and touch no one . With a brief " Hello " he sauntered into his father 's office . On passing the door Dilly saw him sitting there , staring at the cold hearth which he had not the wit to light , a decanter beside him and a glass in his hand . " Well , " she thought with scorn , " Claude 's easy . " Phillis turned up at ten . She had not merely been drinking like her young master , but was roaring drunk . A big black buck Dilly had never seen before ( and hoped never to see again ) had trundled her home from somewhere in a wheelbarrow . Dilly looked into the kitchen and saw them sitting together . " De Lor ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hallieleah , Hallieleah . " " Amen , " echoed the buck . " Mah mastah ai n't no Mrs. Milroy . " " Amen . " " Mah mastah ai n't no Mastah Claude . " " Amen  --  praise God . " " I'se agoin ' ter find mah salvation . . . . I'se agoin ' , I'se agoin ' . . . oh , praise be God . Hallieleah . " As Dilly closed the door on this disorderly scene she heard a crash of breaking dishes and roars of savage laughter from the slaves . She would go to her room and lock the door . As she passed the office once more she could n't help but glance in and gloat over Claude . Surely he too must have heard the din from the kitchen . Seemingly not . He tipped the decanterwith a steady hand , poured out half a glass of brandy , added water from a pitcher , and drank it slowly . There was another crash from the kitchen and a hoop-la from Phillis , a burst of song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hello , " he said with pleas/ant indifference exactly as he had two hours before . " Did you speak to me ? " So he thought those infernal noises came from her . " No , sir , " she said , and went supperless to bed . Claude ! Why , she was not in the least afraid of him . That silly fellow . He 'd never get one more word out of her than she wanted to tell him . IN the morning Dilly was up early . Phillis was nowhere about , but the broken crockery in the kitchen , the spilled ale , kickedoverbuckets , and dirty dishes were enough to turn an empty stomach . There was a pool of bacon grease in the middle of the floor and in it lay the slave 's gay calico turban . Dilly picked it up with the tongs and threw it on the cold hearth . She built up a fire , heated water , and went to work . Oh , the broken china ! She swept bits of salt-glaze , wedgwood and delft into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in when she returned  --  but do n't think about that  --  do n't think . Although she scrubbed the grease spot in the middle of the floor with sand and lye it still showed . She put a fresh **25;5168;TOOLONG upon the kitchen table and believed now she might think of breakfast . Last night she had gone supperless to bed . This morning she had worked for over an hour . She was hungry . Claude , she believed , would be in no mood for food , so she measured out only enough coffee and oatmeal for one hungry person . She minded the two pots that they did not boil over , cut bread , and laid out a plate and spoon for herself . Then Claude appeared at the doorway . " Hello , " he said again , but this time looked vaguely surprised to see her . Not only was he cold sober , but he seemedp246refreshed . His black hair was unbraided and unbrushed . Only his eyes showed how evilly he had spent the night after his father 's funeral . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat himself complacently at the one plate Dilly had set out . " Of course you 've eaten your breakfast ? " " I 've been up for hours . " " Well , it is good of you to make me mine . I suppose Phillis is off somewhere with that big black buck ? " " I do n't know where either of them are . I saw them both last night . They were pretty . . . " She hated to use the word drunk before Claude . He said it himself  --  ruefully , " Drunk . . like me . " She filled his gruel-bowl again and that finished it . The sight of the oatmeal , the heavy cream and brown sugar almost ' sickened her with hunger . At least she 'd have some coffee . She filled his cup and poured out the rest for herself , then sat oppositehim at the table and began to drink it and eat slabs of buttered bread . Claude was not looking at her . He said slowly , " Tell me the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and find out . " No , no  --  Do n't bother , I was just thinking . Tell me the time .. . tell me the time . . . " He snapped one finger down after the other on the checked tablecloth . Four words . Four fingers . " Sir , " said Dilly boldly , for she knew he was but repeating what Mrs. Milroy had said . " Of what are you thinking ? " " Last night I sat for hours before the fire in the office ( there had been no fire except the brandy ) , and all I could hear was , Tell me the time . . . ' I woke this morning with those words in my ears . I believe I did not waste my time . . . listening to Madame 's words over and over again . How many times did she ask you the time the night of my father 's death ? "  |p247Dilly  answered honestly , " Why . . when I told her that Hans was dead . " " And that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then when she came into the kitchen and we knew the general lay out there . . . drunk , we thought . . . and she went up to bed . " " I see . And Alan Brann was winning wagers from Mrs. Peabodyconcerning the time it was he arrived in Worcester . . . This is good coffee , Dilly . " He was hinting for more , but it was gone . His eyes were losing their first heavy sultriness . He seemed quite himself again , although there was no colour now in the usually ruddy face . Dilly answered his questions about the examination of Mrs. Milroy . Seems he himself had been in Worcester the day before and had talked with Alan Brann and Mrs. Bemis . " Mrs. Bemis , sir ? " There was consternation in her voice . Too late , she tried to cover her tracks . " Who is Mrs. Bemis ? " " No wonder you are shocked , Dilly . For I see that you have heard of her before ? " " Yes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been at Mrs. Bemis 's that Morganna had at last tracked down Alan Brann . " You think a man base enough to fall into his cups on the day of his father 's funeral also base enough to consort with harlots the day before ? I see you are worried as to my morals . " " I 'm not worrying about anything . " " Rest assured , miss , it was for no low motive I went to that inn . On the whole I have very good morals . " She wished she could pull her eyes away from his . She could not . But his sudden smile , triumphant , masterful , almost brutal , enraged her . She jumped to her feet , exclaiming ,  | " I do n't care anything about your morals . I hate your good morals ! I hate . . . " " That 's the girl ! I 've heard tell that women in their hearts despise sober men like myself . Prefer rakes . I never heard one admit it so freely before . I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the frank way you 've admitted your love for this Brann . And he must care for you too . An indifferentman would never have given his shirt to a girl for polishingup the andirons . Did he come in and happen to see you with an inadequate piece of flannel in your hands and gallantly strip off his shirt ? As Sir Walter Raleigh stripped off his cloak for his queen ? Somehow the whole relationship between you and Brann fascinates me . " " Ca n't you let me be ? " " No . " There was a sound of men and horse in the yard . " God bless me ! The sheriff rounding up us witnesses ! Look here  --  we 've got to hurry . Braid my hair for me  --  will you ? I 've lost my queue ribbon . " She combed and braided the heavy black hair and found a ribbon . She brushed his coat . He was as tractable and silent as a well-trained horse . Mr. Parmenter was calling to them impatiently . Dilly had only time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shawl and pin it about her . She never once thought of the trunkful of clothes Mrs. Milroy had ordered . " You 'll ride with me , " said Claude . " I 'd rather not . " " It 's all settled . Frost is going to put my Ruby in the chaise . " " I 'd rather walk than ride with you , sir . " But he was already in the yard talking with the sheriff . Parmenter was , as he said , " fit to be tied " when at last Philliswas found in the coach house too sodden and drunk to movep249or talk . She was the most valuable  --  the only witness against Mrs. Milroy and Alan Brann . Claude threw buckets of icy well water over her , shook her and swore at her . No testimony could be expected from her for some ten or twelve hours . " But that Justice Forbush will fling the whole matter out of court , " Parmenter was saying . " Never even hold them for Grand Jury . Claude , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . " Phillis said clearly , " I'se God 's child . " " Oh , you are  --  are you ? " stormed Claude . " You . . . " And Dilly was amazed at the torrent of abuse and profanity which poured forth from the lips of the young captain . Mr. Merrifield had arrived , for he was to ride to Worcester with Mr. Parmenter to give what spiritual aid he might to the lady . He walked quietly to the bitterly swearing captain and laid a band upon his arm . " Claude , " he said . The presence of the kind old man comforted Dilly and she guessed it comforted Claude as well . He might be old and infirm , but he was strong . Stronger even than the young captain . " I 'm sorry , sir , " said Claude . His face relaxed and as it relaxed it saddened and grew wistful . He walked soberly away towards the barn . Seems everything on this day went wrong for Claude . He had told Frost to harness his mare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also been called to Worcester and hated horsebackriding ) had taken the chaise and old George for himself , saddled his master 's mare and gone away an hour ago . Claude flung on a pillion behind his saddle and came back for Dilly . The others had all started for Worcester . " Ruby 's not used to a pillion  --  nor a woman 's skirts , " he said , " but she 'll learn . " Ruby was bound and determined not to learn nor was Claude ( usually a patient man with horses ) in a mood to teach her.  | Claude wanted to be in court as soon as the first witnesses arrived . The slim bay mare reared and plunged and utterly refused to carry a woman on a pillion . Dilly was twice thrown off on her hands and knees and once she got such a grip on Claude 's waist she pulled him off with her . Claude was so angry he could no longer swear and Dilly , worn out by the great strain she had been under , Ruby 's kickings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears . " I 'll break her to it yet  --  sometime , " said Claude at last , recognizing defeat , " or I 'll break her neck . " The bay horse was trembling , sweating , winded . He gently fondled the wet ears , humbly apologizing to her for his own folly . " Dilly , " he said quietly , " you get to the coach house and see if Phillis is in any way recovered , although I know she has not . I 'll fetch out a different horse  --  if there 's one left . " Dilly found Phillis sitting up . " I'se goin ' to go , " she announced . " I'se goin ' to tell de truf ' bout dat woman . She 'd see me hanged for picking up de wallet . I 'll see her hanged . . . Looks like Ah lost mah turban . " " Look here , Phillis . I 've a message for you from Mrs. Mil-roy . " " You jes ' keep dat message , miss . " " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you your freedom . " " No , no , missie  --  you is crazy . Mas ' Claude he done own me now . He told me so . Dat der bitch she ca n't give me ' way  --  not even to mah own self . " " And she 'll set you up in a grog shop . . . . " " Lawkes , miss ! Do n't you say grog to Phillis  --  not dis morning . I tells you I'se agwine to testify ' bout what I knows of dat woman and Mr. Brann . I'se agwine . . . " " But , Phillis , the sheriff left ever so long ago . They don'tp251want you any more . There  --  you lie down again and go to sleep . . . . " " I sure like to get a little sleep . . . . " She went back and met Claude leading his father 's white stallion . " Any luck ? " " No luck . " And she laughed to herself at his trustfulness . " Unconscious yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've noticed before it takes niggers and Indians longer to pull out of their liquor than white men . Now an Indian will stay drunk for days . . . . " He was patient with the stallion as he had not been with the mare . " My Ruby is gentle and this old boy of my father 's is not , but we 'll try him . " He got Dilly onto the pillion so quietly the horse hardly turned his head . They started walking peacefully out of the yard . " Why , he 's done this before ! He came over with the French and a French count gave him to my father . Well  --  I suppose I might have known that a French count 's war horse would be taught to carry at least a paramour . " The horse had two gaits : a low fast singlefoot and a smooth gallop , both were easy for a pillion rider . Dilly kept her seat partly by the board under her feet and partly by her arms about Claude 's waist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxious to catch up with the others  --  seemingly more anxious to see the examination begin than to question Dilly . Dilly was so confident that he would not " bully " her that she could enjoy the rhythm and speed of the strong horse beneath her . And Claude 's own body seemed of one flesh with the gallopinghorse . Strong and firm he was in the saddle . She felt at the moment that she trusted both equally . But at Leicester  --  only six miles from Worcester  --  the stal- lion 's easy mood changed . With all his heart he feared Leicester . A wolfish dog ran out at him . The horse crouched , shied , then flung himself about in a fury , striking at the barkingdog with his front hooves . Dilly 's feet were shaken off the board , but she kept her seat by clinging to Claude . More dogs arrived and the stallion , instead of passing through them , peacefully fell into a fighting rage . In the midst of his own squealing and the dogs ' barking he raised his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Men were now on the scene and the dogs called off . " If that ai n't the fightinest horse I ever saw , " said one man . " Of course dogs are apt to bark at a horse going through town , but I never saw one turn on ' em like yours , sir . And the dogs , they do n't mean no mischief . But I guess our dogs are getting pretty bad . Only two nights back they was out after a horse  --  I thought it must be riderless  --  for they was really out after that one . It was a stallion like yours , sir . I heard him trumpeting  --  just afore he turned tail and ran . " " Perhaps it was the same horse ? " There was now a knot of men , women , and children crowded about the stallion . Several had heard  --  but no one seen  --  the commotion on the common two nights before . " If , " said Claude , " I could but see the hoof-marks of that other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a barnyard . Claude dismounted and carefullyexamined the tracks . He called for the blacksmith . The smith squatted , studied , spat . " Front off shoe do n't match with t'others . Brand-new . Mud cork hai n't worn a bit . " " Will you please to examine my horse ? " The smith did so . " Same shoes ? "  | " Same shoes . And I suppose same horse . I do n't know what you 're getting at , but I see it pleases you . " " Yes . Very much . Now this rumpus two nights back . About what time . . . ? " A woman spoke up . " I can tell to a nicety , sir , for I forgot to set the split peas to soak . I got up , did it by candlelight , and I heard the dogs bark like they had all gone mad . I looked at my clock  --  for we got one  --  and ' t was nigh on eleven  --  say , quarter of . " Back in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Claude said , " No wonder Paris feared Leicester  --  andnow he stares about him as though he had never seen this road before . ' T is all new to him . " " But not to me , " said Dilly . " Mrs. Milroy and I . . . we drove George over it last summer late . " " Dilly , I 've wanted to ask you about that trip to Worcester ( you see I know of it ) . Why did Mrs. Milroy want to go to Worcester ? " " I think she wished to visit the Blairs . " " She was with them only one night and was so upset she hardly spoke to them . No . Why did she go to Worcester ? " " Then , too , she thought I had neglected my own family too long . She said I should go back for filial piety . ' And I 'm glad I went , for everything at Prides Falls was so much better than I had feared . . . did I tell you ? . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why did Mrs. Milroy go to Worcester ? On the very last day of last August ? Dilly felt him bearing down upon her . It was like a physical weight crushing her . Somehow he would get the truth out of her . The stallion had proved himself tractable , but she knew he was short-tempered by the way he had gone at the dogs ( and even Claude had been unable to control him ) . Now he was walking gingerly down a steep hill . She had fallen off a horse three times already this day . If it came to the worst , she could fall off once more . She took the pin which held her shawl at her throat and pricked the stallion low down upon his flank . There was a squeal , the swish of an angry tail . He was off in a series of gigantic leaps . Claude , completely off his guard , had no time to shorten his reins before the horse had broken into a furious run . He leaned forward in the saddle fighting for control . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dilly pricked the horse again . It was only by clinging to Claude 's sturdy waist she managed to keep her precarious seat . She could feel the taut muscles of his back , the give and play of his body to the erratic movements of the horse . She thought , I 'd never dare ride like this with anybody else in the world but Claude , and a little sentimentally she thought no horse could throw Claude  --  forgetting how Ruby had thrown them both only that morning . It was not until they were entering Worcester that Claude addressed his companion . His voice was suave . " Lost your shawl ? " " Yes . Going down Leicester Hill . " " But you managed to save the pin ? " She had had it in her hand . Guiltily she dropped it . " No , I lost that too . " LATE in the afternoon Claude and Parmenter brooded over their ale in a private room at Joy 's . Dilly sat near by . She was mending a torn fichu of Mrs. Milroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay the fine sewing down , for even by the windowit was too dark for such finicky work . The fichu had beenp255handed to her by a chambermaid . Not once today had she been permitted to go to the lady . The linen was twisted and torn , as though a hand had been laid upon Mrs. Milroy 's neck , a hand fierce and murderous . Dilly knew that it had been the lady 's own . The bit of lawn was silent witness to the despair that had overcome Morganna . In spite of the front she could present to the world she had ( alone ) given way to such fury . The two men had been silent for a long time  --  perhaps they had forgotten the girl crouched at the window . She saw by the droop of their shoulders that they were disheartened , and their disappointment gave her assurance . It did not matter in the least that she had forgotten the trunk . Early tomorrow Mrs. Milroy would be allowed to return to Fayrely , and all would be as formerly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murdered man . And Alan Brann ? Oh , he would drift away . Never come back . Never . She remembered that " look " upon his expressive face the moment he had recognized Morganna Milroy on the steps before Joy 's . A look quick , elusive  --  gone before it had even had time to form . Merely " a look " unreadable to her . How had Morganna read it ? Love can read where other eyes can not . Parmenter knocked out his pipe and said , " I 'll bet with you , Claude . Forbush will never hold either for the Grand Jury . " " Do n't bet on a sure thing . " The examination of the Fayrely witnesses had gone on in the back parlour at Joy 's for four hours . Dilly herself had been called three times . Yes , there had been an " understanding " between herself and Alan Brann . He had asked her to marry him and in her nervousness she grew garrulous , gave details of the courtship  --  the date of the day on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had noticed the two swarthy men hanging about  --  yes , doubtless French deserters . There had beenp256paint in the tool shed . The old shirt had been used for polishingbrass . But when Mr. Forbush asked her further about this , she was confused . Her usually nimble mind could think of no convincing detail  --  only Claude 's suggestion that like another Raleigh young Brann had stripped himself of his shirt to pleasure his lady . She could only mutter that she had " found " it . But she had had wit enough to admit that the stains which still showed on the charred fragments of the shirt might be blood . Mr. Brann had always worn this shirt ahunting . Everything she had said Mr. Forbush had accepted , nodding his head . And everything he had written down . So far there were no lawyers permitted to add their sharper questions . Oh , perhaps tonight Mrs. Milroy and she might return to Fayrely ! The men were talking together in such low voices she did not get all of their words . Something about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slut hauled in before the justice immediately after she herself had been dismissed . The girl had been crying . Claude said , " It would seem that in this case it was the lady  --  not the gentleman  --  who paid the extra charge for a privatechamber . Oh . . . if Forbush was not such a fool . . . . He 'll let them go . " There were more suckings of pipes and Claude was saying that four days ago at Springfield Paris had cast off a front shoe . A smith had reshod that one hoof only . They spoke of Phillis and Claude laughed abruptly , went to the door and yelled downstairs for more ale . The maid that brought it reported that Catherine Millis had been the last witness called and Mr. Forbush was now alone going over his notes . And Claude burst out angrily , seemingly apropos of Catseyand the justice , " My God ! how could they have been such fools ! With all the woods and bushes of Fayrely to accommo/date ' em , to go to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Catsey and Mr. Forbush that he spoke . There was a murmur in the hallway below , the sound of opening and closing doors , a patter of bare feet upon the stairs . It was the gingerbread boy ( obviously in Claude 's pay as well as Dilly 's ) who brought the news . " Hot spiced gingerbread ? " " Oh , go ahead tell us . . . you little rat ! " " Mr. Forbush holds them both against the sitting of the Grand Jury . " " Here 's your money  --  take that gingerbread away . Takeyourself away ! Parmenter  --  did you hear ? That old fool . . . " " Mr. Forbush ' most in tears as he signed the paper . But hesigned . " " Well , ' t would seem he 's like the crocodile that weeps as he eats . I never thought without Phillis . . . So he did believe me . . . . Parmenter , we 've got them . " Dilly was on her feet . " Claude . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have helped her some , but not enough . " He pitied the young girl 's white face , the blankness of her eyes . " Look here , child , it does n't mean much that a person is held for the Grand Jury . If there 's the least suspicion they are held . My own alibi was n't too good . Almost was Mr. Forbush ready to hold me . " " He suspected you ? " " He suspected everybody . Even you , Dilly , had to prove you did not kill the general . " " But no one even asked me . " " Not directly . " Mr. Parmenter left them . Claude saw the girl was holding onto the bedpost as though she would fall if she let go . " A swallow of rum ? " " Yes , please . "  | " There , now  --  do you feel better ? " " I do n't know . . . oh , Claude . " She was sitting now in the armchair Parmenter had vacated . He looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not . " Claude . . . I did n't think it would make any difference about the clothes . " " Clothes ? " " The ones Mrs. Milroy sent me back to Fayrely to fetch in for her . I forgot them . And I was so sure she 'd be going home tomorrow , I thought it hardly mattered . How can I tell her ? She 'll be furious with me . Will they let me go to her now ? " " Probably not . Mr. Brown has been well roasted that he let you talk alone with her the first day of her arrest . Look here , Dilly . You write her a note  --  and come with me . I 'm riding back to Fayrely tonight . It 's moonlight and I 've Paris with me "  --  he smiled slightly  --  " not Ruby . And if you promise not to stick pins in Paris . . . " " No , I 've got to stay  --  with her . " " But I tell you you 'll not see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to her . He 's a busy man . " " Would you please to ask him ? " " No , no  --  write your note and come away . " " Then I 'll beg of him . . . " " All right . I 'll go down and ask him to take you to her . But mind what you say to her . . . remember Joy may be used as a witness against you . " " I 'll remember . Thank you , Captain Claude . " MR . JOY 'S fat contented snufflings on the stairway reassured Dilly . They could come from no one but a prosperous innkeeper . But she saw that now he carried a ring of keys in hisp259hand . Mrs. Milroy had been moved from the room she had first occupied . Now she was behind locks and bars . " Three or four minutes at the most , miss , " he murmured as the lock screeched . " I should n't have allowed you to see her alone t' other day . I gotter stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , Mrs. Milroy . " Dilly flung herself in the woman 's arms . " There , child . . . there 's nothing to be so upset over . Sit and we 'll drink a dish of tea . " " Ma'am  --  I can hardly tell you how stupid I 've been . " " Drink your tea and do n't try . And , Mr. Joy . . . will you please be seated and join us ? " Mr. Joy jingled his keys and remained standing . " No , thank you , ma'am . " An innkeeper might sit and drink with a guest  --  but not a jailor with a prisoner . Morganna poured the tea with steady hand , sweetened it and handed it to Dilly . What despair she might feel she controlled for the sake of her young dependent . This generosity was not like her old self . Dilly felt a slight change in her , could not understand it . Ever so little she felt baffled  --  thrust aside . " Madame , " she said at last , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you . I packed them up and in the end forgot them . You see , I never thought I was to ride in behind Claude . I left all those things in your chamber at Fayrely . " Mrs. Milroy did not answer for a moment  --  and usually she was quick in her reproaches . She murmured , " My chamber at Fayrely ! Tell me , Dilly , is it really still there ? The clothespressto the right of the door . The wash-hand-stand and the gold-banded French china . The dressing table . That old winged chair which I did so love . And I liked the chintz best after it was so faded . At first the birds upon it seemed too bright . " After a moment she said , " My bed  --  hung in white . "  | Dilly said , " Claude 's riding back tonight . I 'm sure if I ask him he will bring you that trunk . " " The clothes  --  they hardly matter . There 's little matters any more , Dilly . ' T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenswitch of mood from reverie to animation . " Dilly , did you know that was the tune Cornwallis ' men piped as they surrendered at Yorktown ? Yes  --  a World Turned Upside Down . ' " Dilly saw that there was nothing of importance that Mrs. Milroy would say  --  her room at Fayrely ( and now overbright the birds had once been on the chintz ) . The music the English played as they surrendered to the Americans . Nothing , nothing of the web the young girl felt tightening about her . She wanted to stand up , scream , even strike the woman  --  anything was easier to bear than Mrs. Milroy 's nonchalance . And then suddenlyMrs . Milroy 's hand went to her own throat . It was tense , white-knuckled , trembling . Dilly knew how it might tear once more at her fichu , tear out her own throat if she had the strength . Mrs. Milroy said quietly , " Sometime , Dilly , I hope you will bring me my gear . But I shall be here a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sit for a month or more . They 've sent a horseman tonight to Boston  --  and Mr. Carberry . " " Who , ma'am ? " " The State 's Attorney . ' T is he will bring the charges before the Grand Jury , but that is a long time away . " She stirred her tea , sipped and began to sing : " A great while ago the world begun With hey , ho , the wind and the rain , But that 's all one , our play is done , And the rain it raineth every day . "  |p261Mr  . Joy moved nearer and peered at her . Perhaps the soft clear voice fascinated him . Perhaps he thought that under cover of singing she was conveying some message to her suspectedaccomplice . Mrs. Milroy poured herself another cup . The tea was oversteeped and cool . She set it down with a grimace . " The tea does not suit you , ma'am ? " The innkeeper was worried . " Gone cold and strong ? Permit me to order fresh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know what Mrs. Joy was thinking on to sent this tea up to you , ma'am . Why , this is third-rate stuff . We have a much better quality . Best Dutch bohea . " Soon after the tea had come Dilly went to her little room down the hallway . It was strange that Morganna had made no fuss either over the inferior tea nor Dilly 's stupidity . Little things like that had always before put her in a fury . Something had happened to the lady . Something inside of her . She seemed serene and strong now . And yet a stranger . But she thought of the ugly twist and tear in the fichu that she had mended . Last night ( when alone ) those hands which could so delicately pour out tea today had torn at her own throat.  | IN HER narrow room Dilly could hear the household at the inn starting another day . The chambermaid brooming up the hall . Sounds from the kitchen below . A carter stamping his feet ( for it was now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bright , hard , tinkling ( like the sleighbells in the square below ) from a servant . The tapster rolling in a barrel of rum . Squawks  --  and doubtless murder among the chickens as a stableman prepared the day 's supply of fowl for the kitchen . Her body was rested and she wanted to get up , but there was nothing in the world to get up for . She had nothing to do but wait  --  so she rolled over on her face and tried to sleep . The old lady who had arrived late the night before was calling into the yard for her servant , " Tom , Tom , set the horse to my sleigh  --  we 'll be moving by daylight . " The meetinghouseclock struck six . The servants were having their breakfast in the kitchen belowher . In a moment she would hear Mr. Joy calling them into the parlour for morning prayers . She knew the names of these servants and their faces , but had been too closed away by her own sorrow to care which name went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for over a month and yet all she knew was that there were three maidservants and four names : Cally , Annie , Charity , and Mrs. Prout . One of them was married . She had no idea which . She rather thought Henry was the stableman and Samuel the tapster . It was of no importance top263her which was which and hard to realize it might be important to them . Between herself and the joys the relationship was slightly more personal . She knew the landlady ( goiterous , jealous , walleyed ) disapproved of her and saw to it that she was ill-served . Mr. Joy , half toady and half bully , was always asking her what her folks were thinking about letting a young miss , a virgin ( he supposed and hoped ) hang about a public house week after week . He 'd leer at her when he hoped she was a virgin . He would smack his lips over it as he would smack his lips when he placed a young roasted sucking pig before his guests . " And so young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you she died a virgin . " Dilly came to hate this word so much upon his loose lips she would rather he called her a harlot than a virgin again . She wondered if Good Queen Bess used to feel the same way . Twice or thrice a week Mr. Joy would take her to Mrs. Milroy . As soon as the first strangeness began to wear off and they felt free to talk ( always of little things ) he would jingle his keys . " Time 's up , " he 'd say . Mrs. Milroy took her imprisonmentwith such gentle docility it nearly broke Dilly 's heart . Why did n't she storm at the bully  --  put him in his place ? One look from her angry eyes and he would be but a tavernkeeperonce more . The woman in the barred chamber but three doors down the hall never seemed quite as real to Dilly as the memories she had of her from an earlier time . Mrs. Milroy walking the autumnwoods of Fayrely . Mrs. Milroy sitting drenched in sunshineby her chamber window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her how good life had been long ago in Boston . Standing up to dance the minuet in sumptuous fawncolouredgown with scarlet heels to match the scarlet ribbons on her bosom . Or her beautiful angry face that day she and Dilly had had their worst quarrel , over the hemp  --  Dilly 's fingernails , the heat . Over nothing . And Dilly had gone to the ropewalksand had found Alan Brann lying upon swingling tow . But sometimes on passing the barred chamber she heard the woman singing softly to herself from within . The sound of this voice , sweet , burdened , and yet gay was the old Morganna Milroy  --  not the new one whom she actually visited with Mr. Joy . Only for the sake of appearance she now and again demandedto be taken to the adjoining jail to see Alan Brann . She would sit a few uncomfortable moments with him  --  he with downcast eyes , slouched upon his bed , his cell mates grinning and winking , his legs in gyves . If she was stiff and unnatural with Morganna she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much . She pitied him more than she did the lady . The lady seemed above pity . Twice Mrs. Milroy had sent her back to Fayrely for fresh linen , embroidery work , fine wine , tea , books . She avoided Claude and seemingly he avoided her . But one evening he made her sit by the roaring fire in his father 's office and play checkers with him . She prided herself on her checker game . For the first time in weeks she forgot Mrs. Milroy . But when she raised triumphant eyes ( having queened her last man and won the game ) she caught Claude 's face unaware , quizzically watching her , an enigmatical smile upon his lips . Then she knew why she had beaten him . His mind ( unlike hers ) had been only half upon the game . Now the clock was striking eight and a maid came rushing into the room begging her get up and go immediately to Mrs. Milroy . She flung on her clothes , thinking of a dozen possibilities  --  andthe worst of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran ahead of Cally or Annie or Charity or Mrs. Prout and found for the first time Mrs. Milroy 's chamberopen and heard the lady within scolding wildly and Mr. Joy standing about obsequiously bowing . Mrs. Joy herself was mopping up spilled water , her good eye on the lady and her bad eye looking out the window . It came out that with the help of Mrs. Prout ( who was also Charity and allowed by the jailor to wait upon this prisoner ) Mrs. Milroy had attempted to wash her hair . She had ordered fresh eggs and a lemon rubbed into her scalp , but Mrs. Prout had poured over it too hot water . The result ( as she was loudly proclaiming ) was an omelet . The eggshells had been thrown in the fire  --  in front of her face and nose  --  and stank . Two ewers of water had been tipped over . The pot of soap upset over her dressing gown . The towels were so full of lint they came off on her hair . Mrs. Prout in tears had run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sent for her husband . Annie came with a mop . All was in diabolic confusion . But through the confusion and from under her mop of wet and eggy hair Mrs. Milroy gave Dilly a bright sly look , almost a wink . Then Dilly found that Mr. Joy had promised ( so only she would calm herself ) that Miss Lavander might stay with her as long as need be to restore order . Morganna herself was almost laughing . Six months ago Mrs. Milroy would really have felt what now she only pretended to feel . Mr. Joy , completely reduced to innkeeping , humbly agreed to sit by the window and read his Worcester Spy while Dilly ( having sent for fresh water and towels of a better quality ) worked over Mrs. Milroy . " Every day , " murmured the lady under cover of the splashingwater , " he grew ruder and ruder to me . I decided the time had come ... "  | " It certainly had . " " Tell me , Dilly , last time you went to Fayrely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old yellow ball gown and make new seat covers for the parlour chairs ? " " Yes  --  but I hated to cut such lovely silk . " " Oh , I 'm sure I 'll never wear it again  --  not in Fayrely . You are sure that the ball gown is not too bright a yellow to go with the satin of the sofa ? " Dilly was confused . Upon that sofa had lain the still drippingbody of General Milroy . Dilly had already ripped off the blood-stained satin and made a hasty cover of undyed linen of no particular colour . But Mrs. Milroy was talking as though no change had occurred . " Tell me , " she was saying . " My parlourdoes not look too yellow now , does it ? " " No , madame . It does not . It looks lovely . " " And my chamber ? Phillis dusts it well ? " The truth was that Claude had no sooner got his stepmother off to jail than he had celebrated by buying himself a halfgrownsetter . Habitually it slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not belong there and it would roll over on its back , feathery legs in air humbly apologizing as soon as anyone entered . Dilly had pulled it off by the scruff of its neck , but the dirt and hair upon the counterpane proved that there was where it slept . And Phillis had a cat . Mrs. Milroy would never permit an animal in the house . Dilly decided not to tell Mrs. Milroy of either of these creatures  --  beguiling to Dilly  --  but dirty and distasteful to Mrs. Milroy . The slave and the master had wasted no time in making themselves at home at Milroy Mansion . Phillis was drinking heavily and Claude was too indifferent to control her . No sooner was Mrs. Milroy 's hair almost dried than she orderedDilly to wash it again . Mr. Joy began to nod and snoozep267over his newspaper . And Morganna dared to form the name upon her lips , " Alan Brann . . . ? " " I 've tried and tried to speak to him alone , ma'am , " Dilly whispered . " The window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past . I 've not even once seen his face looking out . And then the turnkey is always about . He says , Be gone with you ' . I can not see him alone . " " Oh , but you must . Oh , God , you must give him my message ! Have you tried money ? Look  --  here in my patch box is a silver pound . That will close the turnkey 's eyes ! I can not think why everyone is so suspicious of us . I doubt if two innocentpeople were ever so set upon before . As for me  --  I can see my cousin Judge Blair alone . I can see darling Mr. Merrifield . There 's nothing to do but ( as he says ) be brave , calm , strong  --  and trust in God , " and she added after a moment 's pause , " Judge Blair believes me guilty  --  " " But how can he . . . ? " " How can he not ? The cards are stacked against us , Dilly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will win . I know it . The Grand Jury sits soon now . And after that Judge Blair is going to engage a red-hot dirty mob-rousing patriot to defend me and Alan Brann . He thinks I 'll need it  --  being known as a Tory and he an Englishman . " Dilly noticed that Morganna expected the Grand Jury to find true bill . It was noon when she left Morganna . The weary desolationof waiting and waiting  --  and nothing to do  --  seemed broken . With the silver pound in her pocket she believed it would be possible to talk to Alan . She was almost happy as she walked out the front door . Dismounting before the tavern were two horsemen . The older was of most serious mien and he carried a portfolio . The other was a boy of about Dilly 's own age . A fat boy , who was saying , " This is where I engaged rooms for us , Mr. Carberry , and it 's here they are keeping Mrs. Milroy in an upper barred chamber . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the chambers above was barred . Mr. Carberry  --  State 's Attorney  --  sent out from Boston . Dilly stared at him , feeling that upon his whim hung Mrs. Milroy'slife  --  and Alan Brann 's life . She saw his face was heavily marked and stern  --  perhaps a little hard , but neither cruel nor mean . He was one of the ugliest men she had ever seen and had the most elegant legs . His trained voice carried clearly , " I do not intend even to see her  --  until after the Grand Jury . " The stableman led away the horses . The lawyer 's clerk swelled with his master 's importance as they entered the inn . Mr. Carberry did not swell with his own . TWO idle faces peered out from behind bars . Four hands grasped the bars . Four eyes recognized her . There was not a schoolboy in Worcester who did not know her story . She stopped and stared back at the two men . " Come to see Mr. Brann  --  hai n't you ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dinner . But while he 's gone I 'm deputy turnkey . " " You ! " " Yeap . Get a beer a day for seeing to it no one talks to Mr. Brann . He 's in gyves and ca n't get up to this window withouthelp . And look it "  --  he showed a cudgel  --  " that keeps Mr. Brann away from coming . "  | " I 've got to talk with him . Look here , sir  --  if things had gone right we 'd have been married by now . " She twisted her hands . She had said this so many times she half believed it . " Oh , ca n't you see how I feel  --  was n't there ever any woman in love with you ? " " Yeap . Fifteen or twenty of ' em . " " And I do n't want to say anything but that I love him . I 'll die if I ca n't speak to him  --  I 'd give anything for five minutes alone with him  --  here by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell you they 've got leg-irons on him . Us two would have to lift him up on a bench .... " The other thief was even more practical . " Lady , how much would you give ? " Dilly 's voice , which had been soft , hardened . " I 'd give a silverpound . " " Jesus Christ Almight ' ! Show it to us . " She did . The two dirty faces and four filthy hands disappeared from the window . She heard one of them say , " Mr. Brann , " and the sound of a heavy weight dragged over a stone floor . An ominousclank of chains . It seemed a long time before another pair of hands , thin , nervous , grasped the bars and a tawny head appeared . It was the first time in her life she had ever looked for any length of time into the eyes of Alan Brann . His glances had always been sidelong , veiled . His hair , which in health had the glitter of an animal 's pelt , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pity and affection for him . " Oh , Alan , " she said . " Alan Brann , " and she took one of his hands in hers . It was not manacled . The man was frayed and worn , and she thought of the calm strength of Morganna Milroy . Something of that strength had the woman imparted to Dilly . Now Dilly was able to pass it on to Alan Brann . He said , " How soon , now , the Grand Jury ? " " Very soon . Mr. Carberry  --  State 's Attorney  --  is arrived . " " Thank God ! I had begun to feel I had been forgotten  --  would lie here and rot forever . Dilly . . . It is as though I were buried alive . Even the ceiling is stone . And these irons  --  I 've regretted every trap I ever set . " " But your food . . . are you decently cared for ? " " Claude sees to that  --  and pays the bill . " " Claude ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try . Dilly . . . " He looked at her soberly a long time , then said softly , " You would not believe that the general killed himself ? " " Oh , but , Alan . He was n't that sort . He could n't have . " " You would n't believe ? " " No . . . I wish I could . But I ca n't , Alan . Nobody could . " " So Judge Blair says . He says , Do n't swap horses now . " " But you do n't have to prove your innocence exactly . Claudehas told me  --  only reasonable doubt . ' And there is reasonabledoubt . Any fool can see that . " " Remember . Mrs. Milroy is an avowed Tory . I an avowed British officer . " " That ca n't make any difference . " For the first time he smiled the sweet sudden smile she remembered so well . He put one hand over hers . " Remember , Dilly , I had nothing to do with General Milroy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and I believe . Alan . . . I 've a message to you from her . " She felt his fingers stiffen . " Well ? " " I am to tell you that she loves you . You are her life and her soul . She will love you up to the grave  --  and beyond . Butp271. . . if when all this is over you wish to go away , you are to feel free to do so . Not bother with her more . Never see her face no more . " He turned away his head . " I wish you had told me that she hated me , " he said bitterly . " She could n't  --  ever . " " See to what her love has led me ! " " Alan ! " " For pity 's sake , Dilly , tell her to hate me . " " It is only for you that she lives . It is for you she keeps herself calm and proud . And she promises that come what may you will go free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them before ! Sometimes I feel that only death can free me . I do not fear to die  --  only let it come soon . " " You have no message for her ? " He thought a moment and answered deliberately . " No . " " Oh , Alan . . . send her a word . . . " " Tell her to hate me . " " I will not deliver such a message . " " Make up whatever you wish . " He laughed savagely . " Oh , tell her I love her ! Love her beyond all reason ! That I would gladly hang for her sake  --  if but she hanged beside me . " He bowed his head against the bars . " Dilly . . . how could I have been such a fool ? " She stroked his bent head and answered honestly , " I do n't know . " She pitied him and yet in the midst of pity was a feather 's weight of contempt . After a little she asked once more for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his voice was lifeless . " Tell her I love her , " he said wearily , " and anything else a man in my position is supposed to say . "  |p272MR  . CARBERRY had a big upper room on the same corridor as Dilly 's and Mrs. Milroy 's . Often during his short stay Dilly , in her lonely prowlings back and forth and back once more , found the door open and there within sat Mr. State 's Attorney with a fire roaring at his back , a table littered with papers before him , attended by his stout young servant  --  clerk , apprentice ; she never quite knew what Benny was . She took it as no good sign that Mr. Carberry 's ugly face always looked unperplexed , even cheerful . Sometimes after she was laid abed she would hear a brief yelping bark of a laugh . Nothing she had ever seen of Mr. Carberry would suggest that he could make such a sinister terrier noise . But she knew that it was he . Neither she herself nor Morganna Milroy were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosie waiting outside his door . And that smith of Leicester who ( at Claude 's direction ) had discovered that beyond doubt Paris had gone that far to Worcester on the death night . She saw Mr. Jedediah Parker , the clockmaker , standing close by Mr. Carberry 's table with the general 's old turnip watch in his hands . He was pondering on it and not speaking , and the attorney was crying , " Well , sir  --  what do you say , sir ? " Why was a clockmaker called in to examine the general 's watch ? Why did she see this small sight with dread in her deepestbones and remember Claude 's voice soft , caressing , almost dreaming , saying over and over Mrs. Milroy 's words , " Tell me the time ? " Once she actually heard Claude asking for Mr. Carberry , but she did not see him . She appreciated the fact he did not seek her out , but this courtesy on his part also depressed her.  |p273She  felt he was so contemptuous of her and her lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She hoped he never would . She overheard Benny ( in the kitchen eating more food ) tell Mrs. Prout that soon he and Mr. Carberry would ride on to Fayrely and go over the testimony of witnesses there . See whom it was they wished to present to the Grand Jury . Soon now the Grand Jury would sit and a justice was to be sent up for Arraignment Day . But one of the Fayrely witnesses seemingly could not wait for Mr. Carberry to come to her . Dilly heard Catsey Millis 's sharp voice demanding to be led to Mr. State 's Attorney , heard Carberry greet her at the head of the stairs . " Ah , yes , " he was saying , " Miss Catherine Millis . Captain Milroy gave your name to me as one I was to see when I go to Fayrely . " " But I could n't sleep o ' nights , sir . I am so anxious to tell you all I have seen and heard . If it 's motive you lack , sir , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice trailed off towards Mr. Carberry 's chamber . Dilly deliberately opened her door , stole down the corridor and stood outside Mr. Carberry 's threshold . She stood stolidly , her arms crossed and folded . If anyone looked up they might see her . She was not eavesdropping . Facing each other and in profile at the big table were Catsey Millis and Mr. Carberry . Benny was inking a pen and shufflingpapers , preparing to take down what might be said . His back was to the door . What malice had prompted Catsey to journey in from Fayrely ? Name and age were written down and Dilly noticed that Catsey knocked off three or four years . She was actually twenty-five and well started on spinsterhood . " Oh , yes ... " she was saying , twisting her mitted hands together . " It was all too obvious . I mean the great and evil passion which Madame  --  Mrs. Milroy  --  had for this Alan Brann . Now once the four of us ( Miss Lavander was there also ) played cards , and Madame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Mr. Brann followed her . And I heard the sounds of sighs , kisses , embraces . " " What sort of a sound does an embrace make , miss ? " " Why . . . you should know , sir . . . how to describe better than I . . . It was , er . . . " " The creaking of the lady 's stays ? " " That was it . Yes . I heard her stays creak as though an arm was laid about ' em . " " Benny . Note : The lady 's stays creaked . " Mr. Carberry 's voice was dry . He was not quite believing what he heard . " Then once , sir , I swear , I was at Milroy Mansion early in the morning and I had a most vexatious cold  --  a summer cold and I had no handkerchief . Then Mrs. Milroy bade me go upstairs and take one of hers . And in that chamber I saw signs enough that that man occupied the bed with her the night before . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything ! The bed was unmade . So I could see both pillows had been slept on . That old blue suit of Claude 's , Miss Lavander had sewed it up and given it him , well . . . there it lay upon a chair ! " " Might Mrs. Milroy not have used two pillows for herself . . . and have taken the suit to her chamber to mend  --  once more ? From what I 've heard tell of that suit , it was always falling apart . " " Oh , no , sir ! Miss Lavander sewed for him . " " Was she living with Mrs. Milroy at the time ? " " No , indeed . I doubt then they would have been so bold as to brazen out a night of it together . "  |p275Dilly  saw Mr. Carberry slowly filling his pipe . " And then ? " he encouraged cautiously . " There was never a doubt of it . I knew all summer . They were thick as thieves . Thicker nor any thieves . . . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And yet , " said Carberry , turning over and examining the paper before him , " here I have Parmenter 's report . And Claude Milroy 's report . Both say you swore shortly after the murder that Miss Lavander and Alan Brann loved well  --  and looked to wed . But by the time you came before Mr. Justice of the Peace Forbush you had changed your tune a little . . . . " " But I had n't had time to think . Put two and two together . . . " " But if you had known all summer that they were lovers . . . had lain abed together in  --  " he glanced again at his papers  --  " either in September or early October  --  Miss Lavanderwas away from the thirty-first of August to the tenth of October  --  that is , in the eyes of the law they were adulterers ( for the law is too cynical to believe ever anything but the worst ) , then why . . . ? " " You see , sir , nothing so evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is but a brief and sheltered life I 've led . It took me time to put two and two together and . . . " " I see . " Mr. Carberry was staring hard at her , his chin thrust out . Even Dilly , seeing this ferocious gaze but in profile , felt the terror of it . " Please to tell me , miss , why it is you 've changed your opinion twice over ? " Catsey nervously fingered the amber heart about her throat . " I tell you , sir , ' t is hard for a lady bred and nurtured as I be . . . to understand ( at first ) all the evil that one actually sees . I 'm not cynical  --  like the law . " She laughed . " It was notp276until after we 'd all been before Justice of the Peace Forbush and I had talked with Captain Milroy . . . " " He put the idea in your head ? " " Well . . . he opened my eyes ( too innocent eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are engaged to marry Captain Milroy ? " Catsey paused , flounced a little . " Ever since we were children , sir . " " And you knew he wished to prove his stepmother 's guilt ? Show reason why it was she and Brann between them might wish his death ? And you wished to please him ? " " Oh , no , sir . . . I but wish to tell the truth . . . . " Mr. Carberry was breaking out the cake at the bottom of his pipe with the farrier 's nail he always carried for the purpose . " If you please . . . I am insisting you tell me why thrice over you 've changed your tune . . . . " Dilly entered the room . " I 'll tell you why , sir . " She had never as much as returned Mr. Carberry 's " Good morning " when they met on the stairs . " Come in , Miss Lavander . " She knew that he ( like everyone else ) knew her by sight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once thought of the truth  --  only how she might most hurt her . And then too last summer she did want to believe Alan Brann and I were lovers , so she 'd have no fear that I 'd take her precious Captain Milroy away from her . A thick-witted and dull fear , I vow . I 'd never even seen him then , nor he me . That was her first tune ! " " Yes . . . Go on . " " And then she thought to hurt Mrs. Milroy 's feelings by telling everyone that Mrs. Milroy loved Alan  --  but he did not love her . " " Yes ? "  | " And now for spite ( and Claude Milroy prompts her ) and she swears she knew all summer long they were lovers  --  guilty lovers , and she 's seen this and that . Sir , " she cried out passionately , " you ca n't take her word in a matter of life and death . Catherine Millis would lie her own grandmother to the gallows  --  if it but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . " " Nothing such as it is to you , Miss Lavander ? " Carberry asked with gentle sarcasm . Benny had the ill-breeding to giggle . Catsey had recovered her quick tongue . " If you are going to take the word of that common country wench aganst me I 'll leave . " " Perhaps that will be just as well , Miss Millis . Thank you for coming to me and we 'll meet anon at Fayrely . " They heard the snip-snap of her heels descending the stairs . Carberry said to Dilly , " Did it ever occur to you that I might have a daughter of about your own age ? " " I never stopped to think . " " Yes . Her name also is Elizabeth , but we call her Betsey . Not Dilly . How did you come by your nickname  --  my child ? " " I do not see it matters , sir . " He was smiling at her now . His pipe was drawing beautifully . She felt he was at ease . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She felt his calm and her own weakness , and wanted to fling herself at his feet , tell her garbled story , hand over to him the responsibility she had neither the wit nor strength to bear . She controlled herself and abruptly left the room . " Wheugh ! " exclaimed Benny . " Gone like that ! She 's a redheadand no mistake , sir . And of all people she 's the one to accuse Miss Millis of perjury ! The kettle calling the pot black , sir . " " I like the child . And truthfully , Benny , I can forgive a woman that perjures herself for love  --  as she does , but not for hate , as does Miss Millis . " He got up and stretched his cramped legs , flicked a bit of ash from his white silk stockings . His legs were his one vanity . " Benny . . . this Mrs. Milroy . It is not many folk who can command  --  ever  --  such storms of hate and love . " " And murder her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've privately come to believe , although I shall ask the Grand Jury to name Alan Brann as the principal . Mrs. Milroy as the instigator , aider , abettor , etc . And Claude Milroy . He thinks so too . This Alan Brann seems to have been one of these disappearing fellows . He 'd have slid out . But the lady ! No . You see , working with a jury , it will be easier to claim that the man  --  not the lady  --  held the gun . Oh , what can it matter ? There 's not the least chance in the world either one is really innocent . " " It has been a beautiful case , sir . You 've enjoyed it ? " " Yes . And yet , Benny , when trial day comes and I see those two wretched folk standing silent at the bar  --  knowing I have power of life and death over them , I 'll have a moment at least when I wish I were an unknown country solicitor with never a case more important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you can have fun with this Miss Lavander  --  and her understanding ' with Mr. Brann ? " " No . I 'll never need her  --  will not call her . And I doubt if the defence does either . By the way . I think I 'll ask Captain Milroy to get her out of Worcester . Send her back to Prides Falls . You 've noticed , have n't you , the captain 's a little more than in love with her ? Yes . He does not know it though . Hep279thinks he only wants to protect her  --  her youth and so forth . But I know how he feels . " " Just a little in love yourself , sir ? " Then Carberry opened his mouth and barked his terrier bark . Dilly , lying motionless on her bed , heard the laugh and shuddered . THE Grand Jury sat and Mr. Carberry with them . But what it was they decided no man knew except themselves . The secrets of the jury room remained for one night secret . The next day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken from her barred chamber and Alan Brann from the jail , Dilly went to the courtroom and found herself a seat . The large room was long , low , elegant . Twin fireplaces against the south wall heated it and betwixt them was the great chair where the judge who had ridden out from Boston for Arraignment Day would sit . Dilly looked about her boldly , feeling she must inure herself to the sight of judges , juries , sheriffs , clerks , tipstaves , constables . Today was but a rehearsal for the greater horror to come . She had not the least illusion but the Grand Jury had found " true bill . " Only the witnesses against a person are called before a Grand Jury , not one in their defence . The coming of the judge was announced  --  a bulky , burly brute in a great wig like the skin of a sheep . She stood respectfullywith the others and heard the sanctimonious swish of his heavy black silk gown as he quickly rolled his fourteen stone into the great high chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his honour spoke testily to the clerk , and the clerk to constables , and a little boy in a blue denim frock was fetched from somewhere and the fire mended . Sixteen men of the Grand Jury entered . These were all gentlemen and had an easy casual air to them . They had been through many an Arraignment Day  --  the office of Grand Juror was almost a life office . Now someone was standing up and asking for true bills . Dilly began to count the brass buttons on the officials ' coats . One , two , three . . . five , six . . . she expected to hear Mrs. Milroy 's name . But instead a loud voice cried , " Jonas Lee Catchaboy , Thankful Catchaboy . . . " Two squat and swarthy men of foreign appearance slouched in between constables and stood behind the breast-high oak bar which served in this country courthouse as a dock . Why . . . oh , surely these were the very tramps Morganna had claimed to have seen skulking about Fayrely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . . . that here were the true murderers of General Milroy ? But when their indictment was read she was confused . It was all about stealing horses  --  not even a white stallion  --  but sorrel and piebald and bay horses , white-footed and bangtailed . What on earth had this to do with the matter of the day ? The clerk was saying , " To which you are to plead guilty or not guilty . " " Not guilty . " " How will you be tried ? " " By God and my country . " " God send you good deliverance , " said the clerk sourly and the Catchaboys vanished . Next was called , " John Perrin . " Perrin was dragged to the bar . He was muttering and hisp281head swung back and forth like a goaded ox . From his mouth spittle drooled . Doubtless he was mad . Seems this yeoman of Oxford had struck an apprentice who ( for the length of some pages ) languishing had lived , and languishing did die . John , even like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wishing to him too a sarcastic " good deliverance . " So there had been another murder done in Worcester County . A nonentityhad killed an even lesser nonentity and no one had bothered to talk about it  --  so full were all mouths with the death of General Milroy . John Perrin muttering and moaning would , like Alan Brann and Morganna Milroy , go on trial for his life at the next assizes . Of course he had done it , and she was sure that the Catchaboys were horse thieves . " Susan Bobster . " This respectable tired housewife was indicted for forging a will . Her eyes flew back and forth seeking shelter . Her workwornhands twisted in her apron . Anyone merely by looking at her , thought Dilly , would know she would forge a will . . . . And then . . . " Morganna Milroy  --  " " Alan Brann . . . " For some reason these two were not brought so far forward into the courtroom which now was crowded with folk waiting for this moment . They stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still . Alan 's face was thin and haggard and his eyes ( even like Susan Bobster 's ) slid back and forth seeking shelter . Morganna Milroy was pale and the dress she wore ( dark , severe , undecked ) became her marvellously . Her hands were locked before her , her eyes fastened upon the judge who glanced at her once , and , perhaps a little nervously , produced a vulgar checked handkerchief . The Grand Jurors craned their necks , for now they saw for the first time the woman they had indicted . Dilly , who knew her well , was surprised at her simplicity of dress and manner , but was not surprised at her air of confident innocence . Mrs. Milroy was making no attempt to impress this roomful . It had been luck only that had made her put on this sombre frock out of which her bosom , neck , white face and powdered hair rose like alabaster . Dilly believedshe saw pity as well as admiration upon the faces of the jurors . Never could they have even indicted her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trial jury would see even before they heard Mr. Carberry 's accusations . If she had been an ugly woman , a plain woman  --  even merely comely  --  they might condemn her to death . But how could they destroy the rarest thing in all the world  --  beauty ? This might be unfair , but Dilly felt it was right . This man and this woman had not met for months and Dilly admired their poise , for neither one looked to the other . Alan 's eyes ( like Morganna 's ) now rested quietly upon the judge . Surely no one to see them standing thus so close to one another  --  and so utterly alone  --  could believe them guilty lovers . A silence grew through the courtroom in which Dilly could hear the ticking of the clock , the hiss of the fire , the roar of blood in her ears , the beating of her heart . The clerk took a long time before he began on this indictment , as though he loved to feel a hundred people hanging upon his words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . . . feloniously , wilfully of his malice aforethought , having a pistol in his right hand , then and there had and held to and against and upon said Arnold Milroy aforesaid did shoot and discharge the aforesaid . Alan Brann . . . with the leaden bulletaforesaid out of the pistol aforesaid . . . the aforesaid Alan Brann then and there by force of the gunpowder shot andp283sent forth as aforesaid , the aforesaid Arnold Milroy smiting upon the left breast of him the aforesaid . . . " A veritable legal jungle . No one could possibly guess , thought Dilly , who it was had shot whom . " And Morganna Milroy , widow of the late Arnold Milroy . . . " ( Do n't think  --  do n't think . Only count the number of aforesaids . ) " We charge upon our oath that you , being instigatedby the devil , did instigate , aid , command and abet of malice aforethought feloniously . . . " It dragged on and on . There had been eleven aforesaids . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said jury , and Boyd Carberry , State 's Attorney . " The silence was so heavy all could hear the crackle of the paper as it was folded , the rustle of the judge 's robes as he moved uneasily upon the bench . For the first time since he had come in muttering about the smoky hearth the judge spoke . " Mr. State 's Attorney . " " Your honour ? " Mr. Carberry stepped lightly forward . " Let me see that indictment . " He read it slowly to himself from beginning to end . Then scratched his stubbly cheek and handed it back . " No mention has been made , sir , of the value of this pistol with which the aforesaid . . . " and he wallowed off into the legal phraseology . Mr. Carberry stood before him like a small boy who has failed in a lesson and slowly he began to flush . " Your honour , may I cite the Massachusetts Bay Colony versus Bates assizes of Norfolk , year 1734 . The value of the lethal weapon  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was it acceptable to the court . . . . And Goodblood versus Goodblood , sir . The value . . . " " Oh , I know , I know , Mr. State 's Attorney , " his honour said testily , " your indictment will not be disallowed for error . I know the law as well as you do . ' T is only I dislike much "  --  and he blew his nose upon his checked handkerchief  --  " to see certain fine old legal formulas neglected and passed over . . . by a generation who knew not Israel ! " So at last this delay was over and it was Morganna Milroy who was saying in a low effortless voice , " Not guilty . " And after her Alan Brann . " How will you be tried ? " " By God and my country ! " Her voice had a slight ring to it . Alan 's echoed hers , leaden and cold . " God send you good deliverance , " muttered the clerk . This time Dilly would like to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the same bored sceptical voice that did not believe in God nor that there was deliverance for any man or woman once indicted of a crime . But surely no one in this room could believe Morganna Milroy . . . And she remembered how earlier she had believed the Catchaboy brothers guilty and John Perrin and Susan Bobster guilty . She had taken it for granted that if they were not they would not be here . Morganna and Alan heard themselves remanded to the next assizes and the constable was waiting to lead them away . Not one glance had these two exchanged . Could any lovers stand thus quietly side by side and never look to the other ? But Dilly now felt they did not because they dared not and that this elaborate indifference to each other was almost as damning as though they had flung themselves in each other 's arms . And she knew Mr. Carberry would read their seeming aloofness even as she did herself . Mr. State 's Attorney  --  ugly  --  virileunderstoodand loved women . Had she not already noticed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thep285inn and another for herself , the maids  --  even for Mrs. Joy ? Aggressive , self-assertive , combative amongst men , for women he would be sympathetic  --  perhaps even weak . Now that these two had been led away Benny was offering his master a mug of ale . He drank and drank . Dilly knew that Morganna 's beautiful white face and quiet eyes had moved him . Anyone could see that he was a little shaken . The clerk was once more reading and wishing a callow sniveling youth of fifteen or sixteen a sour " good deliverance " from the burglary charged against him . Dilly left the courtroom by no means cast down . She believed that Mr. Carberry would never now be able to summon much eloquence against Morganna and that no twelve men  --  good and true  --  could be found in Worcester County ready to condemn this woman to death  --  no matter what the evidence might be . DILLY sought out Mr. Joy who was busy in his own kitchen sniffing and buying hams . She abruptly demanded of him that that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned on her in anger . She had learned long ago that although she might wheedle him ( and let him pat her cheek and breathe heavily at her ) she might never command him . Now she was too determined to see Mrs. Milroy instantly to have the sense to- use tact with him . He had a ham big as a baby , swaddled like a baby and much the same shape in his arms and without puttingit down , he told her he had had enough of her and would it please her to leave his respectable tavern . It was disgraceful that a young maid ( and , he hoped  --  but his voice suggested he had long ago given up hope  --  a virgin ) be allowed by her family to loiter on and on at a public house merely to give aid and comfort to an adulteress who likewise was beyond honest doubt a murderess and was as " witless a bundle of fine feathers as ever I did see . " She was to pack up and be gone , he said , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a baby and he had just nursed it and was now getting up the gulps . Dilly settled back on her heels  --  ready and more than ready for a fight , but she had only opened her mouth when into the kitchen scurried the gingerbread boy . This time he carried a tray of wretched wizened little apples . " Apples , lady ? Two the penny ? " " Get out of my kitchen , you misbegotten son of Satan , " the innkeeper began . The boy winked at Dilly . She knew he had something to tell her . " I want the apples . Carry them to my chamber , and I 'll pay you . " They left Mr. Joy shaking his enpurpled wattles over the stubbornness of womanhood and how easily it is put upon . " Now here 's ninepence , " said Dilly . " Tell me what you know  --  and take these apples away with you when you go . " The boy looked hurt . " You do n't care for apples ? " " They 're rotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Grand Jury . " " Do n't know much and that ai n't what I came for . Well . There was a lot of talk about the clock being wrong and Mrs. Milroy having set it ahead  --  and Mr. Brann did ride the general'shorse far as Leicester and so left after he was shot and probably did it , and Mrs. Milroy instigated . And there was a black woman that lies so much they only believe half of what she said  --  but they do believe half . " " Go on . " " Captain Claude  --  he 's the fellow ! He and Carberry betweenp287them worked out everything . Watch and clock and horse and it was Captain Claude found Miss Rosie down at Bemis 's . And now , miss , he sent me to you . . . . " " Captain Claude ? " " Yes . He wants you to meet him in an hour 's time in Judge Blair 's parlour for to talk with him . " " I 'd rather die than ever speak to him again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best defence lawyer for Mrs. Milroy and Mr. Brann . " " Oh , he 's everywhere , is n't he ? Food for Alan Brann and defence lawyer for everybody  --  and working as hard as he can to hang them both . " " He sure has been running about . He says you come talk to him . He 'll help you . " " I do n't want his help , " said Dilly . " You go tell him so . " DILLY sat with her elbows on her knees and her chin in her hands . Sometimes it seemed to her that she had sat thus without moving and thinking ever since the night of GeneralMilroy 's death . Oh , if only there was something she could do ! There was nothing . Inside of her there was gathering a passionate desire for action . She wanted even to scream and strike out with her fists  --  anything rather than more of this sombre waiting . Her temper , which had always been good enough ( although not of the gentle docility recommended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edgy and now she was ashamed of herself that she had spoken so sharply to Mr. Joy . True it had given her a slight feeling of release , but she had confounded her own purpose . Actually it had given her a glow of pleasure when he had practically ordered her fromp288his inn and called Mrs. Milroy names . She had settled back on her heels and opened her mouth ready to enjoy her rising bad temper when the boy had come . This dull reverie was interrupted by a knock upon the door . She recognized the knock and held her breath , hoping Claude would think the room empty and go away . The knob turned and Claude walked in . His face was sober . " Dilly . . . may I come in ? " " You may . If you have the discourtesy to force yourself upon me . " He took that as assent enough . She sat bolt upright now on her chair . She could hear her own quick breathing and she supposed Claude could as well . " Where do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sat in the armchair . " Did Mr. Joy tell you to leave this inn ? " " He said something like that . I did n't pay heed to him . " " I told him last night I wanted you to go . " " But I must stay , Claude . " " Joy will see to that quickly enough  --  if I stop paying him your weekly bill . " " You pay ! I thought Mrs. Milroy . . . " " Her accounts are a bit tied up at present . I 'm paying for you both , and I do not choose to have you stay here  --  nor in Worcester longer . " " Claude . " Dilly was on her feet . Her voice did not rise . " I despise you  --  for I know what you are at heart . A bully . You think you have the upper hand over me  --  and now you 'll use it ! Frankly  --  I hate you ! " " All right . Why should n't you , you poor little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back to wherever you came from . "  | " ' T is I who decide , sir . If I have n't any money ( and I have n't  --  and I 'll hate myself forever for taking yours  --  not knowing ) I 'll get work somewhere as a chambermaid . I could , you know . " " Or enlist in the army ? " " Who told you  --  ever ? " " Rosie Riley . She overheard Captain Sparrow last spring , and she recognized you . Rosie has a great memory for faces . " But he did not force the question of money . He knew she was perfectly able to do as she said  --  get work as a chambermaid . Holding the purse strings would never hold Dilly . She was a queer thing . So dependent upon those she loved , so independent of everyone else . " I do n't want you at the trial . Frankly because I like you and I do n't want to see Carberry making a fool of you . You know all those things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours and Alan 's love  --  all those lies . Perjury , my dear girl . " " If you do n't want me I 'll certainly stay . I 'll do anything  --  everything I can to help Mrs. Milroy . " " Carberry will have fun with you and your understanding ' with Alan Brann . . . . " She twisted her fingers and licked her lips . " And how the paint did used to slop about at Milroy Mansion ! We were always getting it over our clothes . Mr. Brann 's shirt , Madame 's slippers , and then we would use these things for polishing brass . Slippers make good polishers . " The girl was confused . Had she actually said the slippers , as well as the shirt , were used for polishing ? " I never said that , " she protested . " I could n't have . . . I 'm almost sure . " " But not quite , Dilly . You do n't remember what you did say to Mr. Forbush  --  two months back . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Forbush wrote them all down.  | And if you tell new ones . . . Oh , you 'd better get back to Prides Falls ! Do you remember now what day it was you said Alan Brann asked you to marry him ? " " I could n't have named the exact day . . . did I ? " " Yes , you did . And give the exact words . I remember because they were such funny words . I thought you must have got them out of Pamela . ' " It was true . Mr. Forbush had asked her and she said July . . . July . . . but what day ? And Alan and she had been in the woods together . . . no , in the coach . Something had been said about the coach . And his heart had been full of reverence , love , respect and  --  oh , never now would she recover those words that had flowed so facilely from her tongue . All the pent-up frustration and despair she had endured broke down and nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies , foolishness . Anger against the soberly smiling young captain whom she felt trapping her , holding her . She hated him not a whit the less because she knew he told the truth when he said he liked her and it was for her own sake he wished her out of Worcester . Her pretty face suddenly convulsed with rage and she flew at the door . Claude got there first and set his back to it . " Wait , " he said . " I 'm talking to you . " " I wo n't listen . " " Sit down ! " " Get out of my way . I 'll yell for help . " " Yell . " He reached behind him and locked the door . " Give me that key  --  you infernal . . . " " Now , miss , if it comes to calling names , I 'll win . I 've been in the army six years  --  you only three days . " " Give it me . . . oh , give it me . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one solid arm above the elbow.  | " If you want a fight , I 'll enjoy it . " With all her strength she struck the smiling , pleasant face before the man had time to ward her off , for she was quick as a cat . He caught both arms and held them . " You might kick , " he suggested , " or bite . " Her breath was coming in gasps , but struggle as she might she could not free herself and having been ordered to kick and bite she would not . Yet even in her frenzy she felt ( as she always had ) the kindness of Claude 's strong body . . . something apart from the sharp , sometimes hard , mind . She was almost glad to be held so tightly as to be unable to vent the fury that had gone through her . She subsided , and as if knowing instinctively that it was her last weapon , she began to cry . He let her cry , holding her close to him . She could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , " Will you please let me blow my nose ? " " I 'll blow it for you . " He took out his handkerchief and mopped up her face for her . " Now we will sit quietly  --  and talk ? " " Yes . " " Do you often cry , Dilly ? " " No . Almost never . I wish I could . " " Now you 'll feel better . Look , I 'll put a log on the fire . There 's a chair for you  --  and one for me . " He waited patiently until her sobs had lessened . At last she looked him full in the face . " Claude . . . you 're right . I ca n't go on the stand again . I 've forgotten what it was I said earlier . " " You did not tell the truth ? " " You know I did not . " " The trial will not be for a month and more . Perhaps I can arrange it so you will not be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I doubt if the defence does either . At least I 'm sure they will not bother to extradite you if you simply slip away to Vermont . " " I could n't . I 've got to be as near her as I can . If only , only I could remember . . . Claude . I did n't say Alan got paint on his shirt and that I used the slippers for polishing  --  did I ? " " You might have . " He looked at her quizzically . " Dilly  --  what makes you the way you are ? " " How am I ? " " So able to love . Is it nothing to you that you perjure yourself in the feeble hope of helping Mrs. Milroy ? " " But I know neither she nor Alan Brann did it . I know that , Claude . " " How do you know ? " " She told me . " " You poor faithful child  --  for you are only a child  --  you 'd take her word against all the evidence ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody knows you are lying  --  just as they know Phillis is lying on our side . Why , nothing is going to be easier than to prove that those two were lovers . What a fool you will look standing up and claiming that he loved you . He did n't . " " No . " " Nothing is so lacking in dignity as a lady claiming to be loved where she is not . Carberry will get several good laughs out of you . " She moved with restless indifference . " I 'm not a lady , sir . " This appeal to her pride did not touch her . " Well , I 've engaged the great Ezra Stokes Adams ( on Judge Blair 's advice ) to come out from Boston and defend both Madame and Brann . I hope he will see the senselessness ; 1 '  |p293of  putting on a witness we can knock down so easily  --  and you the foolishness of staying on and on here  --  doing nothing , perfectly useless . " " I 'm not quite useless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the same roof . That is something . " He was on his feet , unlocking the door . " You do not care to have dinner with me ? " " No . " " I 'll tell Joy to let you stay on . Have you any ready money  --  to buy gingerbread and apples with ? " She looked in her purse . " Three and six . " He took out his wallet and counted out some silver . In spite of all she did not like about Claude , he had a way of making everything between them seem natural . " Claude "  --  then she stopped abruptly . For the first time she realized that of late she had fallen into the habit of calling him by his first name only . She formerly had called him by his title . " Yes ? " " I want to thank you for . . . for . . . " " For making you mad and getting you to cry ? " She laughed ruefully . " I guess I 'll sleep better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have chosen for yourself . But you chose it . It 's your way and I 'll bully and browbeat you no more . But please to remember , Dilly , I am your friend and any time you are to come to me freely and as far as I am able I will help you . So lost and alone a girl I never saw . And sometime , Dilly , this will all be over . And the world will go on the same . . . . " " Not for me , sir . I 'll never , never be the same . " " No . Nor I. We will all be different . But the world , I said , will be the same . You see , Dilly , I 'm enough older than youp294to have found out that no pain goes on forever and spring does come , " he said , still fingering the lock . " Do not fear me that I will molest you again for I will not  --  not even for what I consider your best good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time being gone away and Mr. Ezra Stokes Adams arrived . He put up with Judge Blair . Often these two came together to Morganna 's chamber and often Mr. Adams came alone . Only they and Mr. Merrifield  --  who through winter weather and in failing health came out twice a week to comfort the unfortunate woman  --  were ever closeted with Mrs. Milroy except Mr. Joy was present . Dilly was determined that some time before the fifteenth of February ( the day set for the trial ) she would see Morgannaalone . She must give her Alan 's message which by now was much better than the one he had actually sent . On a soft foggy Sabbath morning , as the steeple bell was finishing its call to meeting , Dilly went to the barred chamber and knocked . She had already seen the Joys in Sunday best leave the inn and she knew that before that the jailor had consented to let Mr. Adams go to his client . She knocked , half expecting to be told to be gone , for Mr. Adams had shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead , he invited her in . Morganna had steadfastly refused to go to church . In Boston she had too many times seen folk taken from jail to meeting , the cynosure of all eyes and often the subject of the minister 's sermons . She would not make a similar spectacle of herself . This was the first Sabbath since Mr. Adams 's arrival and he was much put out that she had lain thus long " like a pagan " without publicly acknowledging her need for God . Likewise he was now admitting that it was grievous error she had not from the beginning thought to wear widow 's weeds . " To do so now , ma'am , after I am come , " he was saying , " would seem like the veriest hypocrisy , but why did you not think of it yourself  --  even before you were taken to the justice of the peace ? " Morganna started to yawn , stopped it with a delicate tap on her upper lip . " I had much upon my mind , sir  --  and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has never become me . " The attorney blew out his thick lips . " Madame , " he said curtly , " may I suggest that you are not about to enter a ballroom , but to go on trial for your life ? What matter is the becomingness  --  or otherwise  --  of your clothing ? " Morganna shrugged indifferently . " Dilly  --  yon footstool  --  and it please you . The floor is cold . " Dilly fetched it . She believed the lady was right and her attorney wrong . The lady 's beauty was her strongest defence . Yet Mr. Adams would be willing to throw it away as a thing of little import . Beauty in women would mean little to him , not what it would to Mr. Carberry . It worried her to feel that he and Mrs. Milroy did not work well together . Morganna was obviously bored with him , but in no way fretted . She seemed to have withdrawn within herself , saving all her strength for the trials to come . Her health was good , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gained a new and more elusive beauty and her eyes , always large and expressive , now seemed enormous . At Mrs. Joy 's direction Dilly had carried dresses to the tailoress and stays to the stay-maker to have taken in . But it was her seeming absentmindedness this morning that surprisedDilly . The lady had given her little but a brief kiss andp296was obviously not even listening to Mr. Adams as he explained how it was not necessary to prove hers and Alan Brann 's innocence . Reasonable doubt was all they might hope for  --  and that he was sure he could do . Hard enough would it be for Claude Milroy , Miss Lavander , Phillis or Frost to prove more than that  --  if ever they were put on trial . Then he said abruptly , as Mrs. Milroy tried not to yawn and obviously thought of other things , " You still wish to hold to your story that nothing but patronage passed between you and Alan Brann ? " She turned her head and her eyes flashed with irritation . " As God lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice rang with conviction  --  and yet Dilly knew she lied . If she could lie thus . . . oh , how can I ever know she did not lie to me when she swore . . . no , no , I 'll never believe her guilty . She was telling me the truth . But Mrs. Milroy was going on . " My trip to Mrs. Bemis 's which you say they will make much of , ' t was nothing more than a kindly impulse . Then too , I did wish to employ Mr. Brann  --  fencing my husband 's northernmostboundary . It has been hard in late years to find able workmen . Of course if I had had the least idea of the reputationMrs . Bemis 's inn had . . . " In spite of herself Dilly began to believe her . She noted that Mr. Adams did not . " Stick to it , ma'am , " he exclaimed in grudging admiration . " I swear if only the law allowed us to put the accused upon the stand we could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe the name is ? Well . . . did not sometime during the ride out from Fayrely to Worcester on the thirty-first of last August Mrs. Milroy tell you that the general had asked her to find an able surveyor and fencer for his northern boundary ? Er . . . did she not ? "  |p297Instinctively  Dilly 's eyes went to Mrs. Milroy 's before answering . " Tell the truth , child , " she said nonchalantly , " and shame the devil . " " No , sir . Nothing was said about Mr. Brann  --  at all . " " I believe that both Miss Catherine Millis and the black woman Phillis will testify to passages of love between Mrs. Milroy and this Brann . You were in a better position than any . . . did you observe ? " And Morganna laughed abruptly . " Shame the devil ! " she said . " Once , sir , I saw their heads . . . rather close together . " " Heads close together  --  and that is all ! I believe we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd half thought to skip over you . Now this is important . When the fatal shot was fired ( and I am sure by one of those mysterious vagabonds ) you , I believe , ma'am , were sitting in your parlour knitting . " " Yes . " " And you , Miss Lavander , were upstairs nursing the servant of the general ? And you both heard a shot which later you learned was the fatal shot , I believe "  --  his eyes narrowed  --  " that on hearing it , ma'am , you called up the stairs and said to Miss Lavander , What was that ? ' and she said , One more drunken reveller . ' " Mrs. Milroy moved restlessly . " Will you please both to remember ? " " Nothing of the sort , " she said shortly . He puffed out his thick lips in the unpleasant way he had . " But you were in the parlour  --  not out by the well . I wish to prove it . " Then Morganna raised her head and turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in Worcester in spite of the horse and the clock and watch ? "  | " I 'll attempt it , ma'am . But the fact is if I can not save both clients I had best save one . Brann is a British soldier , a houseless vagabond . A man well used to living by wits or violence . Brann might well have come into the house , burned his own shirt , and ( having already set the general 's watch ) tampered with the parlour clock . And you , being upstairs with Miss Lavander , never have known . Frankly it will suit the jury to believe him a murderer . But you . . . all they will try to prove is that you instigated . And not one thing have they to offer . Nothing . You are a lady and , if you will pardon a personal remark , one of sufficient comeliness to impress your average rank-and-file jurymen . . . . " " Forget not I am a loyalist lady , and hated as such . So you are ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other ? " " It may be all I can do . I 'll do my best . . . . " " And I am to be the one saved ? " He made her a bow  --  a very parody of fashionable gallantry . Mr. Adams had done yeoman service in fomenting rebellion . He had risen from obscurity to dizzy prominence upon the wings of revolution , but he was not a gentleman , and the fact continually grated upon Mrs. Milroy . " I believe that it will be impossible for Carberry to prove in any way you instigated Brann . Do you realize how little they have against you ? Little more than stained charred shoes  --  and who can say those dark stains are not paint ? It was the greatest fortune that the paint happened to be blackish . But that you instigated . . . " Morganna laughed hysterically , frivolously it must have seemed to the learned attorney . " The indictment said I was instigated by the devil and Alan Brann instigated by me . . . oh , lah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep your lies to yourself , Mr. Attorney . I 'll none of them . " The man flushed under his pockmarked hide . He said bru/tally , " This case is nothing I would have chosen for myself . I 'm an honest man by nature . Frankly I do not enjoy your lies any more than you enjoy mine . " " And I do not enjoy your company , sir ! " " Perhaps you would rather be represented by another attor-ney ? " " I never wanted you in the first place ! You , sir , aroused the rabbles of Boston against such men as Thomas Hutchinson , Mr. Harrison , poor General Gage , and my own father as well . You and your valiant cousin Sam ! " " It is an honour to me , " he said shortly , " to be mentioned in the same breath as my third cousin Samuel Adams . But come , madame , both of us are a little frayed . Let there be no words between us . I am your attorney . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not I. They believe that your revolutionary ardour may somewhat counteract my well-known Toryism . " " That was the idea . . . . " " Myself I want no service from rabble-rousers . Sir , I appreciatethe time and care you have taken of me . And I do hope ( if you are as good as I 've heard tell ) that you will still defend Alan Brann . Lay it , sir , to a woman 's whim . But I 'd rather Judge Blair himself represented me . He is at least of birth and breeding . " " Birth and breeding ! And what of it  --  as God lives . " He began stuffing his papers into his satchel . " But let it be as you say . Nor has it seemed to me that we pull well together . Frankly , when first Claude Milroy wrote me and asked me to represent both of you I felt I could not oblige  --  such horror had I of the crime . " " I see . You believe me guilty ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frank and honest with me . But you will not be ! I feel my feet always bogging down in falsehood . " " I notice you have no feeling about your own lies ! Think of it ! Trying to force Miss Lavander to remember my crying out , What 's that ? ' Oh , ' t is the legal profession ! What scamps it makes of man . Now I believe a man may be a judge and a gentleman of honour  --  but not a lawyer . No . And I think your cousin Sam proves the point . " " Ma'am , the fact is Mr. Adams is not and never was a lawyer . " " I 'm not arguing about facts ' ! I tell you he behaves like one . " " You are speaking of one of the noblest men this country ever produced . Myself you may insult if it pleases your aristocraticbirth , but my cousin Sam Adams , never ! And so I shall go to Judge Blair and tell him you have disengaged me ? " " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first place  --  yes . " " Do you realize that that poor old duffer never has handled such a case in all his life ? I pity him . " The matter being settled , he sat a moment longer . Both were now ready to let their choler cool , anxious to part with a semblance of friendliness between them . But when the clock struck twelve Mrs. Milroy stood up and dismissed him . Seeminglyhe had forgotten Dilly , who had sat silent and apart . He locked and doublelocked the door behind him . IF it had been Mr. Carberry who had thus carelessly left Dilly alone with Mrs. Milroy she would have believed the oversight one of kindness . Not so with Mr. Adams . Dillyp301started to go to Mrs. Milroy . She wanted to fling her arms about her , swear once more her belief in her innocence  --  partly because this belief was tottering some . And she must believe . If Morganna Milroy had shot her husband  --  or urged on Alan to such an act  --  she could not , no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still love her but with the love would be mixed horror  --  mistrust . Mrs. Milroy crossed hurriedly to the window which gave upon the square . " I thought that boor would never go , " she murmured more to herself than her companion . " I was afraid ' t would be too late . . . twice every Sabbath day . . . as they take him from the jail to church and back once more . " She stood by the barred window , well hidden by the curtain . " I suppose knowing that he might stay too long and I 'd lose sight of Alan rasped my nerves . I was short and rude to him . It does n't matter . You see he came so early this morning I could not see . . . and I was afraid he 'd stay so late . .. " Dilly stood beside her . " Does he look up ? " " No . Not once . He must know where I am . I know he feels me as he passes by . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . " " I noticed at Arraignment . " " Yes . I never dared look into his face  --  nor he mine lest a whole world read . . . but , Dilly , tell me this . That time you spoke of . The time you saw our heads close together ? " " After the ball . And he and you went together to the garden ... and ... " " Oh , lah , yes . . . Dilly , that was our first kiss . And I 'm not sure but the sweetest . Perhaps first kisses always are best . For then  --  oh , I cared , but not as I came to care . It was heedlessfun . I thought , true , the lad loves me , but I can draw back when I please ; this is nothing and then I found out . I couldn't draw back . Truly , I tried , I fought against it . I could n't , could n't draw back and so in a way that first kiss  --  without fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I still have it , Dilly . Nothing can ever take it away from me . No courts of law . ' T is mine . " One hand delicately traced a writing writ upon the pane with a diamond . After a little she spoke again . " The message  --  did you deliver to him my message ? " " Yes . " She faced the girl . " Tell me quick . . . his answer . " ( Tell her I love her  --  or anything else that a man in my position is supposed to say . ) " Oh , Morganna , he loves you so . " She gave a low laugh and her eyes shone . " I know that . ' T is only his love keeps me alive . " Dilly did not answer , for she believed there was not enough love left in Alan Brann to keep a mouse alive . Perhaps the woman felt her scepticism , for she added in a low voice , " But he loves life even more than me . I know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so alive  --  always so alive . And that , " she said , pointing into the square , " is why this sight is hard to bear . Yet twice every Sabbath I must see . " Crossing the square below them was a knot of people and in the midst of the knot a young man , bareheaded , manacled between two constables , but the leg-irons were removed for church . His chin was up , he walked with that firm , almost lilting , step Dilly knew well . The damp , dank , wintry day , the fog rising from soiled and melting snow , gave a most dismal aspect to the scene , but above it was Alan 's fine , proud head . Chains and bars were hard for him to bear , but he bore them , and Dilly for almost the first time thought of him as the good soldier , brave in the midst of fear . It is thus hep303would look , she thought , if it were bullets  --  not curious glances  --  he endured . And her heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Morganna . " Mr. Joy , in the snuff-coloured greatcoat . He is unlocking the jail . Good-bye , Alan Brann . Good-bye until next week , my poor child . . . . " She turned from the window and paced with that regal stride of hers that could make the humblest room seem like a great hall , to the chair by the hearth . " Dilly , " she said . " My fan . " Even at such a moment she must have a fan to shield her complexion from the fire . She murmured from behind her fan . " There is one thing more you must manage for me . You must go back to Fayrely and wait your chance  --  do not attempt this until both Claude and Phillis are out of the house . Dilly . . . over the hearth in the dining room . There 's a sliding panel . General Milroy fixed it for me when first I came to Fayrely . I wished a place to hide my jewels . And no one ever knew but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nailhead painted white like the rest , but when you press it , it gives . At the same time push at the panel  --  sidewise , mind  --  not in . It slides easy . Inside you will find . . . Oh , I have a diamond pendant there . My father gave it me when I was sixteen . And the emeralds my mother had from her mother 's folk . Other things in little boxes from Persia , China . Silver boxes from the Rhine . And also I have hid away . . . a bundle of letters  --  tied with white taffety , and you are to fetch to me those letters . For I will read them once more and gain strength from them , and when I have read them I will burn them here upon this hearth . They are all in the same hand . You may know it  --  and you may not . I 'm not sure . You will do so for me ? " " I will . " " Say nothing to anyone . And no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Secrecy is of deadly importance . "  | " I will use all care . " " There ! What a load off my mind ! If there is no other way , I can . . . " She sat with her face shaded by the fan , one hand pressed to the perfect contour of her cheek . " Do n't you see ? " she began again . " . . . Ca n't you understand ? Nothing else matters now except our love . For me not even life nor death , so long as we love . Nothing else is real . And , Dilly "  --  her voice dropped to a whisper  --  " I only need close my eyes and I am with him . Oh , never across that dirty brook in yon stinking jail ! But we are both free , free ! And it is no sad winter time but golden autumn forever ! We are in the woods together . Brown ferns and gaudy leaves , mushrooms and brook water . I can smell them . Shut my eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly ever speak to each other . We have no need . Only to be together . Folk wonder that my health has stood up so well . Why , the fools ! Only half the time am I really here , and half the time I am with him ! Oh , the miles we walk together ! Sometimes when I am back in my room once more I can barely wait to fall upon my bed , I am so tired , and then I sleep and sleep ! " Dilly glanced at her excited face . She feared she had gone mad . " These bars , " cried the woman petulantly , " never can these bars hold me ! I tell you I pass beyond them at will . " Dilly spoke soothingly as she might to a child , for she was sure her mind was broken . " After all this fresh air , ma'am , could n't you eat a little more ? " The chambermaid had told her the lady scarcely ate at all . Mrs. Milroy snapped her fan shut with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot to tell you . We do eat , Alan and I. That 's half the fun ! Grouse rolled in clay and baked out-a-doors . Sometimes we steal a little . Sweet Indian corn and apples . Digp305potatoes from the earth . And when the farmer comes after us how light and fast we run ! Do you remember I 've told you of my father 's garden in Boston and how my brother and I used to run so fast our feet scarce touched ground ? " Dilly nodded . Morganna had indeed told her of this garden , and by the tone of her voice ( more than by any description ) had made it more real to Dilly than any garden she had ever seen or would see . " Nigh unto flying . And yellow Johnnycakes and little red squirrels . Fish as well . . . " Dilly 's compassionate face showed her consternation . " There , child , " cried Mrs. Milroy , pressing her hand , " I 've frightened you . Never worry . ' T is but a game only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had really eaten all that food you 'd be taking my frocks to the tailor 's for another gusset ? But of one thing I am sure . I wish you could find out for me .. . These dreams , these fancies  --  I am sure they occur at the same time and in exactly the same way to both Alan and me . I mean , when I think of running fast and light through the woods . So does Alan . When I think of roasted grouse and the broken race , so does he  --  and so we are together . It is the dearest intimacy , for we dream alike . " But Dilly believed that bars were bars for Alan Brann and chains , chains . Never might he escape at will and refresh himself with country air , feed upon grouse rolled in clay or sweet Indian corn . He could go through the matter with stiff lip and stern courage , but Morganna had actually grown more beautiful , more radiant , in a way more girlish , through confinement . They heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered that Miss Lavander , contrary to all his orders , was closeted with his prisoner.  |p306DILLY  hired from Mr. Joy a small black cob ordering it to be saddled and brought around for her at sunrise Monday morning . But on Monday the sun never rose . The snow had fallen and the northeast wind had blown all night and it was a day of blackness and whirling snow . Already up and down Main Street drifts had formed as high as a horse 's belly . Any sensible person would have postponed a trip , but Dilly felt that she could not . It was not so much Morganna 's need for her love letters that drove her to start out in the storm as her own passionate desire to do something at last . Mr. Joy grumbled , but as she promised to double the usual hire for a horse , he consented . The cob , hardly more than a pony , was clever and willing . He trotted briskly where the wind had blown the snow away and humped himself cheerfully through drifts . The road she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on such a day . They feared to lose the ill-marked highways , to wander off into the snowy wilderness and there die . There were no tracks for her to follow , but until she was about to enter Fayrely she kept her way . Then she found herself in a vortex of whirlingsnow . Nothing else was left either of earth or sky . She turned this way and that trying to find cornrick , barn , sheepfold , that might help her at least to a house . All works of man had been obliterated by the storm . She could scarce see further than the snow-caked mane of the black pony and his small furry ears . Now she might be miles from her road and she might be but a few yards . She did not know . The pony was tired plungingthrough drifts . Whenever she let him he now would turnp307his rump up into the wind and settle himself philosophically to wait out the storm . Once more she urged him on . Then he lifted his head and blew through his nostrils . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a great barn emerging through the torrents of snow . It was a long low barn and opposite it was another . Strange barns . Strange and familiar . Why , it was General Milroy 's ropewalk . Somehow in her senseless wanderingsof over an hour she had completely skipped the centre of Fayrely and come close to her destination . As might be expected on such a day , both Phillis and Claude were indoors . Claude had been to Boston and brought back with him all the books pertaining to his father 's privateering , for having got many merchantships by his marriage to MorgannaBale he had fitted them for privateers and had had them at sea since the beginning of the war . What a fortune they had made ! Claude wondered if his father had ever guessed . Then the lumbering business in Maine  --  the sheep island he owned off Nantucket , his interest in Gloucester fishing . . . all these business records Claude had spread over the dining-room table . Thrice daily Phillis brought him a tray , but the table had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched for a chance . But there was none . She did find one nailhead that gave easily under her fingers , but it was not until both Phillis and Claude were out of the house that she was to slide the panel back and get out the letters . The dining room was where Claude sat all day , smoking and studying his ledgers and lists , his setter at his feet . She felt both he and Phillis suspected her unexplained appearance . The worst of it was she had been so frightened by the snowstorm and so thankful to get to safety she had prepared no proper reason to explain why it was she had come . Claude had no sooner got her boots off , her feet in warm water and a hot toddy down her than he politely demanded to know to what he owed the courtesy of a visit ? She had stumbled about , answered him clumsily . Something about Mrs. Milroy wanting a bedgown and her own need for a wadded jacket . His face had brightened with interest at her clumsy answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scent . Phillis complained that Dilly 's coming made her a " peck o ' work , " because Dilly could not stand to see how slatternly the house had become . The kitchen floor must be washed . Swill must be carried out to the pig daily  --  not allowed to stand and accumulate . The slave would begin drinking before breakfast and by noon she was befuddled and often by evening drunk . All this domestic discomfort Claude seemed to accept without noticing . One day Phillis beckoned Dilly aside and put her big , foulsmellingmouth close to her ear . " What sort little shop , miss , Mis ' Milroy say she willin ' to set mah up in of things turn out right for her ? " " She said she 'd give you a little grog shop . And your freedomtoo . Do n't you want them , Phillis ? " " Naw , miss . But Mastah Claude and Mistah Carb'ry dey wanted to know just what trash Mis ' Milroy she try to temp ' me into perj'ry for to git . Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hah ! " On the fifth day Dilly decided that nothing but a trick would get these two both out of the house . She had been to see Mr. Merrifield and found that not only was he wretchedly weak and ill but his old servant was down with a flux . True neighbouring women came pouring in ready to do the work . If anything there were too many  --  not too few  --  willing hands to help at the parsonage . But Dilly went to Claude and told him she believed the old man dying and he was set upon seeingp309him before he went . Phillis was to go as well , for his servant was sick and there was no one to tend him . No sooner had she seen the two of them well out of the driveway than she ran to the dining room . She pressed the nailhead with one hand and with the other slid back the panel . Before her was a cavity of some four or five cubic feet . It was not half full . She smelt sandalwood and camphorwood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's garments . And there indeed were the little boxes from Persia , the Rhineland , far-off China , and a heavy sack full of money and the package of letters neatly tied with white taffety ribbon . And there also was . . . it could not be . . . but it was . Folded at the bottom of the hiding place was Morganna Milroy 's blackish maroon glace dress . This dress was the one she had worn the evening General Milroy returned to his death . Mr. Parmenter had asked her what dress it was she had had on and she had said the gray paragon and Phillis had agreed and Dilly ( who took her cues from Mrs. Milroy ) had agreed and Claude ( no close observer of women 's attire ) had said he " supposed so . " No . Madame had put that on only after Claude had gone to her and bidden her be up and ready to meet the sheriff . But Dilly had never forgotten Morganna Milroy pacing and rustling back and forth waiting the return of her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death days of Milroy men . Tearing her handkerchief in her passion . Trying to knit a silk purse . That blackish dress  --  the colour of dried blood . She had always known it was somewhere  --  and here it was . Dilly sat in the chair beside the paper-littered table . She must think . But perhaps it was some whim that had urged Morganna to hide away the dress . Dilly raised her head , herp310hands clenched . She would take it out and examine it . If it were unstained , she would continue , in spite of everything , to believe Morganna innocent . If it were bloodmarked  --  then she would know .. . She bent her head and prayed , " Oh , God , into your hands  --  Upon your head I now lay the blood-guilt of Morganna Milroy . Oh , God , help me ! Do not let the dress be stained ! . .. " The prayer helped her to walk once more to the hiding place , and she carefully took out the dress . She carried it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rustled as she turned and turned it . " Oh , God , I give you thanks ! " She had spoken too soon . For the length of a yard about the hem , for a height that would reach to a wearer 's knee , the silk was stiff . She pressed her lips together and did not cry out . Her fingers and then her eyes recognized that here was the biggest bloodstain she had ever seen . Morganna did it . She shot him , she thought dully . And she was sorry for it , and she knelt beside him  --  in his blood . Why , it must have soaked through her petticoats . Wet her knees ! She went back to the panel and there at the bottom of it was a careless bundle done up in Worcester Spy 's . She saw the ruffle of a petticoat . There was no need to unwrap that . So she sat awhile longer , then took up the dress , laid it back once more and put the pretty boxes on top . Started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had almost forgotten . She knew it was Alan Brann 's writing although she had never seen a sample of it . Yes , she had . That letter he had left behind him on his chest of drawers with a candlestick on top . She had been the first to find it . And the grease had fallen on it in the shape of an owl 's head . She fingered through the bundle . Here it was . But when was it they had indulgedp311in all this correspondence ? She did not know and never would . Doubtless while Alan lived at Job 's Folly and seemingly they had seen but little of one another  --  some hollow tree they had agreed upon  --  loose brick in the garden wall . And thus by letter they had schemed when and where to meet , thus sworn their devotion . She shut the panel and instantly she heard Claude 's dog bark sharply and then whine . Someone he knew and loved was coming . Now as she stared at the panel it seemed to her anyone would know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not like the others . She ran to her chamber , hid the letters under her pillow . Now she must face Claude 's wrath . But first she must go once more to the dining room . She was sure now the panel had not been shut tight ; one of the boxes had been left out on top of Claude 's papers . Had she put back that roll of petticoats ? She could not remember . She glanced at her hands . Half was she afraid the old dried blood had come off on them  --  or dripped upon the floor . Everything was at rights in the dining room . The panel closed , its contents hid . No blood had fallen . But she still could smell the spicy , rosy fragrance of Morganna Milroy 's clothes . Claude , coming in from the kitchen , met Dilly face to face in the dining room . " What is it , Dilly ? " he asked . " Have you lied so much for a purpose of late you now have taken to lying for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I suppose you thought a walk through snow would be good for Phillis and me . What was your idea ? Or perhaps you had no idea ? " Then she began to laugh . She laughed and laughed until her lungs gasped for air and tears ran from her eyes . She sawp312Claude coming at her with a dipper of water . " No , no , " she laughed , but he flung it at her . This sobered her and she went to her chamber to " rest , " she said . She must be sure that the letters were still safe under her pillow . It was noon only and she would like to have immediately saddled the black pony and started forth , but she feared to further rouse Claude 's suspicions . Tomorrow , oh , tomorrow she would fare forth , the letters Mrs. Milroy craved safe with her . ALTHOUGH Dilly got the letters safely to Joy 's , it was anotherthing to deliver them . They were too bulky to be stuffed into the front of her bodice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to unrip them in Morganna 's chamber . Never would the jailor give her a chance . She found that with practice she could carry them for a short way between her knees . It gave her a mincing , mawkish walk  --  but not more so than many fashionable women affected . Catsey Millis , for example . Mr. Joy was persuaded to take her to Mrs. Milroy , but when at the last moment she said she had to go to her own chamber to get a handkerchief , he was so huffed she feared he would not wait for her . In a moment she had joined him , the handkerchief displayed in her hand . If her gait was a little finicky he did not notice . But Mrs. Milroy did . " Dilly , " she exclaimed impatiently . " What on earth is the - matter with you ? You stand about stiff-legged as a child that wants to go to the privy and is too shy to say so . Please , if that is what worries you , leave me and return . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to Mr.p313Joy . She could frame the one word " letters " with her lips . Aloud , she said , " It 's not that , ma'am . ' T is only that I 'm so saddle-galled by my ride to Fayrely and back . " " You 've worn the skin off your inside knee ? My poor child  --  let me see . You should have salve on it . " Mr. Joy , like many another overly sensual man , was also overmodest . This talk of privies was bad enough , but at the thought of Miss Lavander displaying bare knees he walked sternly to the window and fastened his eyes upon the square . He cleared his throat to suggest to these careless ladies that a male was present . Dilly easily dropped her bundle at Mrs. Milroy 's feet . Instantly out from under her voluminous skirt a shoe-tip slipped out and hooked them in under her petticoats . Her face was flushed ; she spoke rapidly . " Well , you have the thin skin that goes with ruddy hair . Dilly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joy . Add brimstoneand some say salt . Yes , it will smart , but use it thrice daily . . . . " In aside she murmured , " Oh , thank God , Dilly . . . and thank you , Dilly . Now I can sleep in peace . " Then aloud , " When the scab forms break the scab to let the humours out . . .  |p314THE  DAY before the assizes folk began to arrive on footand on horseback , in chaise , chariots and coaches . The high sheriff of Worcester County was besought to hold the trial at the meetinghouse to accommodate the vast throngs that wished to attend . But he would not . Let those who might , find seats for themselves in the courtrooms . Let the others stay away . There was not a bed left unengaged for the night , for it was believed the trial might last as long as sixteen hours and for a capital case no stopping in the middle was customary . On and on it would drive regardless of sleep , almost regardless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost the first time , spoke politely to Dilly . Would she not be willing to share her bed that night with a stranger  --  or even two ? Everywhere in Worcester folk were doubling up and doubling again . Dilly would not  --  in spite of Mrs. Joy 's assurance that half of the piratical charge she would be able to make would go to the girl . Claude had engagedthis room for her by the week . The week would not be up until Thursday next . Mrs. Joy was huffed and made a very rude remark about girls whose rooms are paid for by gentlemenat public houses . No sooner had Mrs. Joy left her and she had sat herself by - the window to stare out in the vacant unseeing way she had fallen into of late , than she noticed that down Boston Road came a group of five dark-clad mounted men . Venerable men , she guessed , partly by the way they sat their horses , partly byP315the ambling nags they chose to ride upon . They had come . The Judges of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered summertime and these same men departingfrom Fayrely for Springfield  --  and the green corn growing . Morganna had shuddered at the sight of them , " . . . like as though they trod upon my grave . " Black crows had they seemed to her  --  ready and overready to flap their wings and caw , " Hanged by the neck until you are dead . . . " By some inner sense Morganna had known . Dilly had not . Hats were pulled off , curtsies dropped . All stood staring respectfully . Unmoved and scarcely responding the five learned riders came to the plank bridge over the brook . Beside it was a fording place through which folk often rode their horse for water . All five of the gentle nags pricked their ears at the smell of water , turned their heads , anxious to drink . Four of the judges by the least pressure of the reins kept their mounts to the bridge . But the fifth gave in to his horse 's desire . Seemingly he cared more for his beast 's comfort than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood relaxed in the midst of the icy brook and drank and drank . When done , the horse stood a moment , the water dripping from bit and muzzle . The judge patted his neck and evidently he spoke to him . Then the horse was up the shallow bank and hastened to join his fellows . This small act of kindness on the part of one of the judges aroused Dilly 's curiosity and confidence . She must find out who he was  --  the littlest one among them . Surely the man who considered his dumb beast 's thirst would not be unmindful of human agony . By nightfall she knew . The little judge who had kindly watered his horse at the fording place was the greatest of allP316of them . He was Timothy Otis , Chief Justice of Massachusetts . MRS . JOY came very early to Dilly and she said that she was to go to Mrs. Milroy . Now that it was known that neither side would call her as a witness she would be allowed ( under only Mrs. Joy 's eye ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found Morganna already dressed sitting as quietly as one of the porcelain shepherdesses at Fayrely . She had a tray beside her , hot chocolate , toast , thin slivers of rosy ham . There were two cups upon the tray , so Dilly knew that it was for her to sit and try to eat . The food stuck in Dilly 's throat , but the woman ate well and characteristically she . did not speak immediately of the great matter at hand ( for in two hours she would stand trial for her life ) but of old Boston days . How good the chocolate had been at Frean 's . Of a " turtle " ( as she called a picnic ) she had once been on at Nahant . Then she said suddenly , " You see , Dilly , I decided to wear my grey paragon . It 's sombre-hued enough to suit even Mr. Adams . ( Is n't it strange  --  I suppose when next I see him he will be in a way my enemy , for now he is hired , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . I have some love for this frock . And it is the one I had on the night General Milroy died .... " Her eyes faltered and she turned abruptly to her cup . Doubtlessshe remembered that Dilly ( if no one else ) would know that it was somewhat late on that fatal day she put it on . " Dilly , you know it is the usual custom that we stand , Alan and I , from the beginning even to the end of our trial . Hour after hour . No chair permitted us only that bar we are allowed to lean against . I have been practicing here in my chamber . Yesterday I stood for five hours . But this may be ten or more . P317And never will we be allowed to speak . Not one word may the accused say in his or her defence . I do n't know whether one would be allowed to say anything against oneself . I have n't any idea . Well  --  one crosses one 's bridges when one comes to them  --  my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I most wanted to ask of you . Will you please to pack my duds for me ? If I am acquitted , I will sleep tonight in freedom . Not here . And if "  --  she paused but went on quietly  --  " I am found guilty such luxury as this chamber will not be allowed me . I 'll lie from then on in the common jail . " " Oh , Morganna , I know you will be acquitted . " " Yes , yes , child . I 'm sure of it . The trial may be so short I 'll get back to Fayrely tonight  --  so do n't pull such a long face . I swear to you it will all come out right . " But Dilly knew that she spoke thus confidently not because she believed her own words but to give comfort . The woman had changed much in the few months of her confinement . There was plenty of vanityleft , she still loved a looking glass and as of old she would demand this and that  --  her stool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but she had a new generosity . She did not wish to worry this child whom fate had thrown into her . hands . She could now think of her predicament as well as of her own . But this change in her made her sometimes seem a little distant and strange to Dilly . Self-controlled she had never been in the old days , yet now it seemed her ruling characteristic . Only once did she seem noticably perturbed and that was when in a low voice she begged the girl to now go to the courtroom . It would be crowded and many would be turned away . " Dilly , if I can but feel one pair of friendly eyes upon me I can play a gallant part . " She moved as though to put her arms around her and kiss her , but turned away abruptly . If she had , Dilly knew they would have both burst into tears . " Go now , " she murmured . " Go , go  --  do not say one word . " AN hour before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room was taken , not only in the courtroom , but in the halls and upon the stairs . Outside , the square was thronged with disappointed folk bitterly criticizing the high sheriff that he would not adjourn the assizes to the meetinghouse . Dilly had arrived early enough to find herself a seat upon a bench . She was pressed into narrower and narrower space as at last eight sat on a bench designed for six . Today there were five chairs behind the table on the dais . Close by was the oak bar behind which the accused must stand from beginning to end and never speak . Yonder were the benches for the jurors . She saw Claude and Mr. Carberry arrive together . Seats had been saved for them . Judge Blair and Mr. Adams sat together . Then a voice rose and instantly folk were on their feet and the room was silent . This strange cry was the clerk announcing the entrance of the judges . The High Sheriff of Worcester County came first and then Mr. Chief Justice followed by his four lesser companions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and great wigs , at first sight they looked much alike . But there was the gross and brutal face of the judge who had ridden out for Arraignment . She saw his thick fingers feel about in his pocket and come out frustrated . He had forgotten his checked handkerchief . Four of these judges looked learned , pompous , a little inhuman . But Timothy Otis , the Chief Justice , did not . His yellow face , round eyes , crooked mouth , his meagre bones that not even the great robe he woreP319could make impressive , suited ill with her conception of how a Chief Justice should look . So she was confident that he had been selected for his actual worth  --  not for his grand manners . There was a cry of " Make way , make way ! " and two constableswere leading in Alan Brann . He walked to the bar , took his place behind it , but did not lean upon it as at last wearinessmight force him to . A mutter and a slight hiss went up . The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapped for order and immediately for a second time the cry of " Make way . " Every neck except Alan Brann 's and the five solemn judges was craned . Folk were on their feet struggling to see . Mrs. Milroy entered on the arm of Mr. Joy . She carriedher powdered head high . There was a faint automatic smile upon her lips . She turned slightly and spoke to the sheriff . Glittering , poised , fragile , and indestructible , she seemed a being from another world among the homespun farmers and their wives . Dilly was instantly conscious that she had not made an entirely favourable impression . Too artificial . Too elegant . Too sure of herself . She stood so close to Alan Brann he must have smelt her familiar fragrance as well as have heard the rustle of her silks . He did not turn his head . A stony look had come into his eyes . The business of selecting the jury Dilly did not attempt to follow . A few names and faces she noticed : Orin Boyles , cordwainerof Holden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Noah Spotford , farmer of Shrewsbury ; Dr. Richard Parkman , and a name that sounded like " rabbit , " and the deaf man who was excused , and the Quaker also excused . But at last twelve men were impanelled and sworn . Dr. Parkman ( the only one with silver buckles to his shoes ) was pronounced foreman and sat in the foreman 's seat . As far as she was able she kept her eyes upon the fiveP320judges . They seemed so unworried they quieted her . Now she knew why it was Mr. Chief Justice looked vaguely familiar to her . With his round yellow face , round eyes and white wig he reminded her of the effigy of King George . Then the indictment once more with its ridiculous language that would need a lawyer to decide who was charged with shooting whom but this time it ended with the statement , " to which you have pleaded not guilty . " An hour 's time had gone as she could see by the clock upon the wall and still the case had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by side those two must stand at the bar hour upon hour upon hour until the whole case was over . Now at last Mr. Carberry was on his feet . For this great occasion he , like Judge Blair ( but not the more democratic Mr. Adams ) , was in black silk gown and woolly white wig . He spoke in a low voice , so clear and ringing , so full of warmth and yet void of all tricks , everyone ( except the judges , who doubtless were inured to it ) was unconsciously charmed . Now he was explaining to the jury that this was the most serious and arduous service their state could ever ask of them . " Not Lexingtonand Valley Forge , " he was saying , but Dilly lost track of the smooth low syllables . Unconsciously she was waiting only for one thing . The mention of Morganna Milroy 's name. " . . . beyond doubt or cavil I will prove to you , gentlemen , the blood guilt of this unhappy pair . Alan Brann and MorgannaMilroy " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know they stand trial today for the brutal butchery of the greatest and most beloved man Worcester County has ever produced . I will prove first the motive which lay back of this most dastardly crime . For , gentlemen , they were lovers  --  he , her paramour . She , his mistress . My witnesses will convince you beyond any doubt of this unfortunate and guilty relationship . Nor can myP321learned brother refute this claim . Gentlemen  --  they are not on trial for adultery although this too is a crime by the laws of this state , but I wish you to understand the reason why it was they both wished for the death of General Milroy . While he was gallantly fighting for the liberty of all of us , leading his men to battle , helping to bring our war to a glorious victory , these two had been able to indulge their guilty lust to their heart 's content . But once let the deceived husband return to his own roof and how long would such a state of things be tolerated ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice . Not hear the words , for he was cleverly contrasting the British deserter , the avowed Tory lady , with the heroic soldier . Then Mr. Adams was on his feet objecting to this bringing in of political beliefs and after him was Judge Blair . The court corrected Mr. Carberry , who humbly bowed his head . But he had already said ( and the jury had heard ) all he wished . Not one man upon the jury he was claiming but knew General Milroyat least by sight . A strong and vigorous man  --  a true American . Proud of his high position amongst us and jealous of his private honour . Mrs. Milroy and Alan Brann , fearing his just wrath , knowing that as soon as he returned the jig would be up , got together and plotted his death . " How or where they plotted , gentlemen , I do not claim to know . Nor is it the sort of thing one often may produce a witness to prove . The more evil the crime  --  the greater secrecy surrounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose only fault was he had taken a woman , beautiful , I grant you , but a whore at heart , a whitened sepulchre , a disgrace to the name of woman , to wife . And one more thing may I point out . As long as the husbandlives , the wife has no control over her property . She was practically penniless , although she came to Arnold Milroy with a great dowery . But if he died she would be so wealthy she might support a dozen paramours  --  if she wished . She did not wish . She wanted only one . And I believe she hoped to marry him . " A servant , a slave , and a neighbour will all testify as to the relations of Alan Brann and Morganna Milroy for the four months preceding the murder . A young woman of Worcester  --  a respectable serving girl from a near-by tavern  --  will testify that on the 31st day of last August , Mrs. Milroy , referring to her co-defendant as her husband , sought him in his bedchamber . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of marriage , has , gentlemen , long been accepted as proof of physical intimacy . But this point is for you to decide  --  not for me nor for their honours upon the bench . Did MorgannaMilroy claim to be Alan Brann 's wife , go to his chamber and lock the door because she hoped to persuade a recalcitrant servant to return to "  --  his voice grew sarcastic  --  " a certain job of fencing and surveying you will doubtless hear much of from my learned brother ? I say they went there for but one purpose  --  avery old and evil purpose at that ! " So these two were lovers . Mad with love . Crazied with love . Any man or woman who stood between them was hateful to them . One person did  --  General Milroy . You all remember that on the 26th of last October word came to Worcester County that the Battle of Yorktown had been won . This joyful news came to Fayrely  --  and with it the intelligence that General Milroy would in a few hours ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy ! All decent and patriotic folk . But two ( and I believe only two ) at Fayrely were not . Gentlemen  --  an avowed Tory lady and a paroled British soldier . And guilty lovers . What dark madness went through them I do not pretend to know . I must leave that to your imagination . " HeP323paused , giving the slowest-witted among the jurymen time to use his imagination . Dilly began to count one , two , three , four  --  anything to keep from hearing Mr. Carberry 's quiet words . Nineteen , twenty , twenty-one . And sixty-seven , sixty-eight , sixty-nine , seventy . But she could not entirely shut out that damning flow of proof from the State 's Attorney 's lips . . . " that she was presentwhen the fatal shot was fired , or soon afterwards , I believe her bloody shoes are sufficient proof . Shoes , gentlemen , which later she attempted to burn , thereby admitting . . . " ( One hundred and ten , one hundred and eleven ) " . . . the attemptedburning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheriff into believing the crime was committedan hour later . . . . " ( One hundred and ninety-nine , two hundred ) " That the watch has been tampered with I will prove to you by the testimony of a very artful clockmaker . That the hands of the clock on the Milroy mantel had been turned ahead I will prove to you by the testimony of one of the four men who came to that house on the night of the murder . This was before Mrs. Milroy had found the moment to reset her clock . I believe she was under the impression that not one of the men present that night had a watch upon him . . . Her conduct and his upon the night of Arnold Milroy 's murder was as clear an admission of guilt as though they had said , Look , here we stand before you and confess the murder . ' Unless one accepts their guilt , there is no other way one can account for their actions . . . . " ( Three hundred . There ! I 've counted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buttons and it worked . That man over there , he 's got . . . one , two , three , four . . . ) But she could hear Mr. Carberry 's effortless voice go on and on .   And " . . . hanged . " Mr. Carberry almost whispered the word . " For that is what I will ask of you . I demand it ! " and at last his voice rang out . " Your state , your republic , God demandsit ! By the laws of God and man the crime committed by these two can not go unpaid . Atonement must be made ... . Blood crying from the ground  --  even as the blood of Abel cried long ago to God . . . . " He was winding up to his peroration . All of the court officers whom Dilly could see but one had twelve buttons upon their coats . One had ten . The first witness called and sworn was Catherine Millis , and there stood Catsey  --  looking as she never had before . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England quality had come out in her ( under Mr. Carberry 's careful management ) and she looked years older and already set in the spinsterhood Dilly guessed she so much dreaded . Her hair was parted in the middle , her dress a sensible brown perpetuana . And when ( after due preliminaries ) she began haltingly to testify as to how it was she had not at first understood the evil that her eye actually had seen ( being unsuspiciousof evil ) she carried conviction . Yet this was almost word for word what she had said to Mr. Carberry , and both he and Dilly had known that she was lying . Now he was nodding his head , accepting her words as gospel truth . Now those words seemed damnably convincing . Her voice was so low anyone could see how hard it was for her to thus publicly mention such things as a bed disordered by a guilty couple . Glad enough had she been a month before to blat it forth ! The Chief Justice himself asked her to raise her voice . She looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyone who did not know what a hypocrite she was might have felt sorry for her . How she must hate Madame that she would consent to ap-P325pear in such poor fashion knowing , as she did , that Claude himself would see her . Dilly glanced at Claude . His fingers were irritably tapping his knees . He felt as Dilly felt , and his face made no secret of it . But the courtroom at large was rather in favour of Miss Millis . She now was a village type they knew and really respected , in spite of unkind jokes . What a contrast she made with Mrs. Milroy . The lady stood proud in her porcelain , artificialdelicacy , powdered , patched , silk-clad , exquisitely shod . Dilly 's heart sank . Morganna should have had Mr. Carberry to tell her how one may best appeal to provincial jurymen : farmers , clerks , tinkers , and small gentlemen . Mr. Adams and Judge Blair had not thought . Seemingly Mr. Carberry not only knew more of women than his " learned brothers , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His long-bearded goat 's face was alive with suspicion . If he disapproved of his mistress , at least he disapproved of everyone else  --  including Mr. Carberry . The State 's Attorney was obviously angry with him , for Frost was unwilling to swear in court to those things he had already told Carberry in private . He would hardly admit there was a coach in the coach house or such folk as Mrs. Milroy and Alan Brann . If it was hard to get anything out of Frost it was equally hard to control Phillis 's ready flow . She was gorgeously arrayedin a shiny new black dress , red and yellow calico turban , and red and yellow apron . She was no sooner sworn than everyone was leaning forward ready to laugh . The slave , in no way intimidated or cast down , expanded for her audience . This was the big day in her life , and she meant to enjoy herself . Judge Blair began by objecting to the testimony of a slave , and the court reproved him . It was allowable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicle at all . We do not believe it will ever find any large place in the world of sport . " This article should silence George Tichnor . For the last few months I have been corresponding with Frances Harbach . I receive her letters at the office . I write her from the office . There is nothing in our letters to which Pearl could object , but there is a strange streak of jealousy in Pearl . The mere fact that I am corresponding with an old friend of the opposite sex is enough to make her sulky and cross  --  if she knew it . I write Frances about Kansas City and my work . She writes me about Buffalo , what our old schoolmates are doing and about her own work . She has learned stenography and is working for an insurance firm . I can see no harm in this innocent correspondence , although I can admit to myself that I still love Fran and always will . Every letter from her is a great thrill . APRIL 19 , 1910 . The principal news of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. B. Clark Hyde , on charges of killing Colonel Thomas H. Swope , who gave the magnificent Swope Park to the city . Today Dr. George Twyman , the state 's most important witness , died . His death was a blow to Prosecutor James A. Reed , for Dr. Twyman was to testify that he found Miss Margaret Swope on the point of death from cyanide of potassiuma few minutes after she took medicine administered by Dr. Hlyde . Frank Walsh , attorney for the defense , claims that cyanide was injected into Colonel Swope 's dead body in an attempt to build a case against Hyde . The state 's case is based on the assumption that Dr. Hyde sought to wipe out the entire Swope family so he could inherit the fortune through his wife . The city is divided into two camps  --  those who believeDr : . Hyde innocent and those who believe him guilty.  |p101It  seems to me there is enough evidence against him to hang him half a dozen times .

George Tichnor 's literary hero , Mark Twain , died yesterday in Redding , Conn . The Star and Times devotedseveral columns to his life , which was really remarkable . I got his " Innocents Abroad " out of the library and find it rather humorous , but otherwise not particularly exciting . Apparentlyhis fame rests largely on his books for children and I really have no time for children 's books now . Today I interviewed an inventor out on St. John Avenue who quoted with George Tichnor the fact that scoffers laughed at Robert Fulton . This inventor , whose name is George Wash/ington Mills , is inventing a gyroscopic belt for window washers . A motor revolves the gyroscope wheel and , he says , permits the window washer to lean back from the window sill with no danger of falling . To make my novel truly representative of America , I must have an inventor or two among the characters . The inventors could supply comedy relief . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is devising an apparatus to take electricity from the air . He has a roomful of rheostats , wire coils and what not and a tower on top of his house . He claims he can get enough electricity to light an incandescent bulb when everything is working properly and I guess he does get juice from someplace because every few weeks he is knocked cold and they have to take him to the General Hospitalin an ambulance . This inventor claims Westinghouse has offered him $100,000 to suppress his invention , but he has refused because he wants to be a benefactor of humanity . I think he 's a liar . Judge Latshaw has deprived Dr. Hyde of his liberty on bond and had him locked up in jail following testimony of the bookkeeper for the Hugo Brccklein drugstore . The bookkeepertestified from his records that Dr. Hyde made four purchases of cyanide of potassium and declared he wanted it to kill dogs . JUNE I , 1910 . Decoration Day I had to help cover a great aeroplane flight at Swope Park and took Pearl along . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We estimated there were at least 75,000 people out lining the smooth lawn of the golf course to see Barberry Brown , the famous aeronaut , make his " death-defying ascent to the skies in the first heavierthan-airflying machine ever to appear in Kansas City . " They had the National Guard out to keep the crowd from danger and the flying machine was up at the west end of the links near the shelter house . It was a flimsy-looking contrap/tion made of bamboo and cloth with a small gasoline engine and propeller mounted to the rear . The mechanics had a great deal of trouble with this engine , working on it for an hour or so while the great crowd stood in the blazing sun eating popcorn , ice-cream cones and frankfurtersandwiches and drinking soda pop which vendors were selling along the half-mile course . Finally the mechanics got the little engine popping merrily and Barberry Brown appeared from the shelter house carrying his little daughter on one arm and holding to his pretty young wife with the other . Despite the heat he was wearing a leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aeroplanefrom every corner to keep it from flying away without Brown , so he kissed his wife and little girl and they hotly were crying for fear he would be killed . But like a soldier plunging into battle Barberry Brown tore himself away from their lovingclutches and climbed up into the aeroplane seat while friends led the apprehensive wife and daughter away to safety . Brown strapped himself securely into the seat , turned his cap around backwards , and slipped a pair of big automobile goggles over his eyes . He yelled at the soldiers to let go , grabbed hold of the control sticks and leaned forward like a jockey . Then the little gasoline engine went sput-sput and the propeller wagged lazily and stopped . The mechanics yanked and spun the propeller for ten minutes but the engine had gone to sleep and was n't going to be disturbed . So Barberry Brown finally let go of the control sticks and took off his goggles and unstrapped himself from the seat and climbed down off the aeroplane . He took off his leather coat and went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to crowd in closer and were kept back by the National Guardsmenand their rifles , and the vendors sold thousands more ice-cream cones and lukewarm soda pop and cool frankfurter sandwiches.  |p104After  half an hour of this Barberry Brown got the engine popping away once more and his wife and little girl were allowed to come up to cry and kiss him and cling to him the second time . Then they were led away sobbing again and Barberry Brown put on his leather coat and turned his cap backwards and adjusted his goggles and climbed back into the seat and strapped himself in tightly . Again he grabbed the control sticks and yelled " Let her go ! " to the soldiers . But this time the engine began to roar like a racing motorcycle and the propeller flew around so fast you could only see a glinting circular streak and Barberry Brown leaned forward like a jockey again and the aeroplane actually began to move down the green lawn of the golf course . It moved faster and faster and the crowd was cheering so loud you could scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sped , then miraculously it lifted from the ground . It actually was in the air . It lifted higher and higher until there could be no question that it was flying . It was as high or higher than the heads of the people lining the course and it remained in the air nearly a hundred yards . Then it settled easily to the grass again and the engine ceased its song . Soldiers swarmed over the aeroplane and dragged it back to the starting point with Barberry Brown still riding triumphantlystrapped in his scat and waving to the enthusiastic crowd . Near the shelter house they stopped and Brown unstrappedhimself and climbed down . His wife and little girl rushed up wild with joy that he had been returned safely and smothered him with kisses . Then the mechanics began to take the aeroplane to pieces and the 75,000 people all made a rush for the streetcars that were lined up back of the shelter house . Pearl became ill from too many frankfurters and ice-cream cones and I had to go with her behind some shrubbery and hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the office and nearly missed the first edition with my story . Of course I could n't write the sort of story I have written here of Kan-pI05sas City 's first aeroplane flight . I had to make it all enthusiasm and hoop-la . I wish George Tichnor had seen it all , he being so certain there will be aeroplane lines crisscrossing the nation like railroadsin a few years . I think I have flown almost as far on a toboggan as Barberry Brown did in his great aeroplane . JULY 6 , 1910 . It would seem that Providence directs the human race upward despite the innate stupidity of humanity itself . We have just lived through a striking and disgusting example of mankind attempting to descend to the level of the lower animals and of kind fate taking a hand . Interest in the prize fight between the negro , Jack Johnson , and the white man , James J. Jeffries , approached a national hysteria . The press far and wide painted Jeffries as the savior of the White Race . By the power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from the giant black man and thus prove superiority of Caucasians over Africans . For weeks the newspapers of America have been filled with the opinions of experts declaring " Jeff " to be invincible , holding " Li'l Arthuh " to be afflicted with a " yellow streak a foot wide up his back . " On the streets , in barrooms and other gathering places one could hear little else than discussion of the size of Jeffries ' biceps , the fact that he never had been knocked off his feet in a prize fight except once when he slipped , how he was capable of crushing in any man 's ribs with one blow , how heretofore he never had dared hit any opponent with all his strength , but how he would show no mercy for Johnson and , delightedly , how it was most probablethat Johnson actually would be killed by the boilermaker . The most respectable Star and Times have been as reprehensiblein handling this affair as the admittedly yellow Post . For days preceding the fight the first pages have carried longp106stories about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what he ate and his every word was taken down and published as if this hero of heroes were an oracle . And the keynote of the whole spectacle , emblazoned in black type across the nation were Jeffries ' words  --  " I 'm going into this fight for the sole purpose of proving that a white man is better than a negro . " The Star engaged Convention Hall for the Fourth of July to accommodate the crowd which should wish to hear a blowby-blowaccount of this epoch-making conflict bellowed by announcers through megaphones . They say the Hall ' was jammed to the rafters with nearly 14,000 men , women and children eager to avail themselves of this boon conferred upon them by the paternal Star and ' Times . The promoters of this affair and the daily press co-operated in making a degrading fist fight an actual issue between races . Is there any wonder that the negro districts such as Eighteenth and Vine streets and inner Independence Avenue took Johnson'svictory as exemplification of black supremacy ? Is it any wonder that they took Jeffries ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it any wonder that race riots followed all over the United States resulting in eighteen dead and hundreds injured ? But , as I say , Providence seems to intervene for the benefit of humanity . Had Jeffries won , as all the experts agreed he would win , we should witness a tremendous revival of prize fighting with all its attendant evils . And if there is any more brutalizing agency than the sight of two hulking men poundingeach other to bleeding insensibility , I can not imagine it . I actually feel the admittedly uncivilized sport of bullfighting is to be preferred . But Johnson 's victory has brought the public to its senses and has spelled the doom of prize fighting in this country . Even John L. Sullivan , the former champion , realizes this andpI07said , " It will be the last big fight in this country . " The ChristianEndeavor has started a move to prohibit motion pictures of prize fights being exhibited and from the local reaction it appears they will be successful . Even the newspapers are remorseful . The Star , attempting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said editorially , " The complete seriousness with which the gentlemen of the sport fraternity have spoken of the fight as hinging the supremacy of the white race is a contribution to essential humor not to be lightly prized . " Prize fighting has played its part in the history of America . It would not be out of place for me to work a prize-light episode into my book if I can think of a method to utilize it logically without detracting from the principal theme . My family is moving away from the old home on Peach Street in Buffalo , the house where I was born  --  where all of us Zigler children were born . I got a letter from Mother last week with the news . Father has taken a new job in Pittsburgh with the SusquehannaBrass Works where he will be superintendent . They have put the house up for sale with a real estate man and are moving right away . Bessie will go with them , but Ethel probably will stay in Buffalo . Ethel likes her job at William Hengerer 's store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hodge who has a store out in Kenmore . It will be strange to think of Mother and Father and Bessie away from Buffalo . JULY 14 , 1910 . I had a strange dream this morning . I was back in Buffalo and saw a group of young fellows I did not know standing on the corner of Genesee Street at about Hickory . They were lounging back against the store window smoking cigarettes and talking when Frances came in sight . She stopped on the corner waiting for a streetcar . She wasp108carrying a handbag and a paper package which apparently was her lunch . Presently an inbound Genesee car came in sight and Frances stepped out . The loafers stayed where they were . There was a depression in the street at that point which forced Frances to step up nearly a foot and a half to the car . It drew her skirt up , revealing perhaps four inches of trim stocking above her shoetop . At this the loafers chortled among themselves and one cried out , " Oh , you kid ! " The dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at my watch and it was 6:3o . That would have been 7:3o in Buffalo , the time when Frances actually would be going to work . I wonder if I witnessed something in my dream as it really happened . Unfortunately the nature of the dream precludes writing Frances about it . I should give the world to see Frances . Perhaps I should leave Pearl  --  perhaps that would be the kinder thing . But I 'm afraid Pearl never would give me a divorce and I 'm also afraid that Frances would not marry me under those conditions . After all , Frances is religious and I fear she could not countenance marrying a divorced man . I wish I could take a vacation back in Buffalo and then talk things over with Fran . But that is out of the question . AUGUST 3 , 1910 . I am out of a job  --  and under circumstances which seem most unjust to me . Also I can not get a job on either the Kansas City Journal or the Post . I am writing letterstrying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the city editor , gave me an outof-townassignment to investigate a mystery at Olathe , Kan . A correspondent there had given the tip that a horrible murderapparently had been committed in an old mill on the outskirts of town and the circumstances convinced Tate that an experienced newspaperman should look into it . As it appeared I might be several days on the assignment.  |p109I  packed a bag and took one of the red Strang Line interurbancars late in the afternoon . Olathe is a pretty town of about 2,500 , the county seat of Johnson County and something like 30 miles from Kansas City . I found the mystery even more spectacularly gruesome than first reports indicated . The mill had been closed for more than a year and the door securely fastened with a large padlock . The keys were in the charge of an elderly man named Knoche who lives down the dirt road and across a weed-grown field from the plant . This morning Knoche noticed the door of the mill unaccountablywas ajar . The padlock had not been opened . Instead the heavy staple had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the plant and the sunlight streaming dimly through the dusty windows revealed a sight that sent him hobbling as fast as he could go to tell his story to authorities . Here is what the Olathe police and the Johnson County sheriff found when they drove out to the mill : Fifty or sixty feet back from the door was a rusty old anvil . This anvil was smeared with clotted blood . Blood was spatteredover the floor at this point . Near the anvil was a light sledge also bloody . And mixed with the blood on the anvil and on the sledge were strands of long blond hair . From the anvil to the door there was a trail in the dust of the floor , indicating that something had been dragged out of the mill . There was virtually a stream of dried blood along this trail , which continued outside the door through the plantainweeds to the rutty road . The trail ended there , indicatingthat the gory burden had been loaded into a wagon or automobile . Caught into splinters of the floor the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow horn side comb and onep110yellow horn hairpin . And in the dirt outside the door they picked up a cheap brooch . This is a complete list of the clues in the possession of police that Saturday night . They had made a perfunctory check of Olathe and surrounding country , but could discover no missing woman . To their mind and to my mind the evidence indicated a young blond woman had been murdered in the mill and her body carried away either to be buried or to be hauled north to the Kaw River , weighted and thrown into the current . The fact that no woman was missing around Olathe indicated that the victim had been brought there by her assailant probably from Kansas City or Argentine . This would be evidence that the conveyance employed was an automobile rather than a buggy or wagon and such a deduction was borne out by discovery of faint marks of automobile tires in the road . If the murderer had an automobile it might be deduced that he was fairly well-to-do  --  at least something more than a laborer or worker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Armourdale . But his victim was not well-to-do . The brooch was such a bauble as might be picked up on the jewelry counter at Jones Store for thirty-five cents . A well-to-do man slaying a poor woman almost inevitably means an illicit love affair . The sheer ferocity of his act in crushing her skull against the anvil with a sledge would tend to show that she had been using her condition to force him either to marry her , if he were a single man , or to pay her a large sum of money if he were married on threat of revealing their relations . I deduced that the victim was a large woman from the fact that her body was dragged rather than carried . I pointed out that it was true that if the murderer were a small , weak man he might be forced to drag the body of an average-sized woman , but that , on the other hand , the fact that he swungp111this sledge with such deadly effect was good evidence he probablypossessed more than usual muscular strength . I wrote at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it made a wonderful Sunday story . The Sunday Star played it on the first page . Al Wiggins of the Kansas City Journal also was down on the story . He is tall and cadaverous and lazy and entirely incapable of deductive thought . I do n't think he even bothered to go out and look at the mill . Instead he sat in the sheriff 's office rolling and smoking one brown-paper cigarette after the other and acting the smart aleck by poking fun at the authorities . " I ca n't get much excited about murders until they find the corpus delicti , " he said . Then he took his feet down from the sheriff 's desk and rose and stretched . " Well , Zig , " he asked , " going to catch the next car back to town ? " " No , " I said . " I 'm going to stick around awhile . " Wiggins grinned in his smart-aleck way . " Sorry I ca n't stay and help you , " he said , " but I got a date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for being late now . " Then he turned to the sheriff . " Give you a tip , Sherlocko , " he drawled . " The way to catch this murderer is to go to the public library down the street . Check up on the kids that 've been reading Huck Finn ' lately . " The Journal printed two or three paragraphs of Wiggins ' flippancy about the mystery which , compared with my two columns of dramatic description and deduction , looked pitiful and in very poor taste . But one never can tell what weird tricks the Wheel of Fortunewill play . Because Sheriff Ocherblatt is a conscientious officer and not inclined to overlook any possible point in an investigation , he actually followed Wiggins ' random shot about the library . It seems there is a faked murder in " Thep112Adventures of Huckleberry Finn , " which is a boys ' book written by Mark Twain . The sheriff discovered the book had been taken out two weeks before by a 15-year-old boy named Claude Johnson , the son of a carpenter and contractor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also 15 , had been seen around the mill in the crowd during the investigation , quite apparentlyenjoying the excitement . Under close questioning on Monday Claude Johnson confessedhe had been inspired by the Huckleberry Finn story to stir up a sensation and that he and young Sullivan supplied the stage settings for the murder mystery . Johnson had swiped some hair from his older sister 's switch as well as taking the side comb and hairpin from her bureau . Sullivan had taken the brooch from a box of old trinkets at home . Together they stole a rooster from a chicken yard and killed it . It was the rooster 's blood which was smeared so liberally over the anvil and sledge , which was dribbled along the dusty floor after they had made a trail with a sack of bricks . Both lads were arrested on charges of malicious mischief , breaking and entering and petit larceny . Their fathers , however , paid for the rooster , repaired the mill door , and finally the boys were discharged after a severe lecture . Meanwhile , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatic story of the investigation  --  which the evidence most certainly warranted  --  coupled with a list of women missing from the Kansas City district under the caption , " Is One of These Women the Victim ? " The blow fell Tuesday morning when the Journal carried a burlesque of my stories on Page One with a two column cut of a crowing rooster which was labeled , " The Star 's MurderVictim . " They made unmerciful sport of the Star and Times and Colonel Nelson was apoplectic with rage . He ordered my immediate discharge , which I consider a monstrousinjustice . Colonel Nelson has the reputation of beingp113a just man and often a kindly man . But he fired me without cause . Had I been drunk on the job it would have been different . If I could have been accused of laxity or laziness or incompetence it would have been different . But my only fault was excess of zeal . I hold that my reasoning on the evidence at hand was exceptional . 1 hold that my stories were exceptional . If the Star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they play the stories on Page One ? It simply did not occur to me that the Olathe Mill case might be a hoax . Neither did it occur to the Olathe authorities . Neither did it occur to City Editor Wade Tate . Neither did it occur to Colonel Nelson himself or the Monday story never would have been printed . And all the evidence was in my stories for them to scan just as it was for me at Olathe . It was only that the Journal 's Wiggins , too lazy to make deductions himself , too intent on keeping a date with a redheadedwoman to bother about writing a story himself , by the sheer chance of having read the book which inspired the Johnson boy to the hoax , jumped at a conclusion that there might not be any murder at all . Ninety-nine times out of a hundred Wiggins would have been wrong in following such a course . Nine hundred and ninety-nine times out of a thousand I should have been correctin following my course of hard work and deductions . But this happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hero at the Journal office . And I am out of a job . I would not go to the Journal asking for a job . But I did go to the Post in its cluttered-up little office on Main Street . As I approached the city desk some reporters in the rear of the room recognized me . They broke into a chorus of " Cock-a-doodle-doo ! " which confused me terribly as I asked the city editor , a man named Smith , for a job . Smith grinned broadly at the rooster crowing and said he was sorry , but he did n't believe there was an opening on the Post for me.  |p114Pearl  herself has been far from sympathetic at this turn of fate . Because we have so little money it will be necessary for us to move back with her mother until I can find another job , which will be almost unbearable for me . At a time like this I can not help comparing Pearl to Frances . I know Fran would be understanding . I know Fran would see that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would encourage me rather than nag at me and call me loony for being hoaxed by a couple of boys . I hope I can find a job far away from Kansas City . I never want to see this place again . And when I get away I have made up my mind I shall never send for Pearl . Perhaps that is the course of a cad , but I do n't think so . Pearl and I have nothing in common . I know I do not love her . I do n't believe she ever loved me . It was only that she wanted to get married and I happened to be an available man . I know now that Pearl does n't always adhere strictly to the truth when it is to her advantage to lean the other way . Now I doubt very much the story she told me about the Oklahoma oilman . I fear that may have been only a bait to lure me into marriage . It seems to me that it will be better for all concerned if Pearl and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this may be so  --  it may not be too late for Frances and me to be reunited.  |p115OCTOBER  5 , 1910 . I am reading copy of the San Francisco Tribune . I like the job , I like the paper and I am entranced with San Francisco . I have been here a month now and have been assured my work is satisfactory . They are paying me $32.50 a week , which is more than I could have made in years in Kansas City . I have been living at the Dalt Hotel on Turk Street and saving my money to send for Pearl . If everything goes right I shall be able to mail her transportation inside of another two weeks . I have definitely cut away from Frances , for I realize now that correspondence with her was doing me no good . I have not written her of leaving the Kansas City Times and the Times had no forwarding address . I owed her a letter when I left Kansas City . She will write one more letter and when that is returned to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kansas City last month Pearl told me she is going to have a baby . It will be born sometime in April . I now have a great responsibility to provide a comfortable home for my family . I must also save every possible cent toward doctor bills , as well as for Pearl 's transportation out here . And she , in her condition , can not travel two-thirds across the continent in a day coach the way I did . She must have the best of care.  |p116I  am working harder than I ever did before at the office , hoping against hope for promotion . I am grooming myself for an executive job . Because I am more than willing to put in a little overtime reading time copy , which they call " grape " or " bulldog , " Hugh Murphy , the head of the copy desk feels kindly toward me . He has made a point of complimenting me on my good heads and being very gentle and helpful in correcting me when I violate some rule . This is in direct contrast to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is a feud on between Murphy and Fred Waldron , the telegraph editor . Waldron is friendly with Jimmy Albertson , the news editor , while Murphy is a confidant of Mr. Rothstein , the managing editor . It is quite plain that Waldron wants to get the copy desk slot job and that Murphy considers Waldron dangerous and would get rid of him if he could . I personally should like to be telegraph editor . The job probably pays $45 a week , which is practically all the money anyone could want . It seems to me that things are bound to come to a head between Murphy and Waldron soon , and I want to be prepared . I want to impress Murphy with my work so he might recommendme , should he succeed in ousting Waldron . Also I want to keep on friendly terms with Waldron because the telegraph job would he open also should Waldron become head of the copy desk . There is a great difference between reading copy here and in Kansas City . In the first place this is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copy readers handle local or state or telegraph copy indiscriminately . It is much more difficult writing the headlines than on the Times in Kansas City . There you wrote only one top line reading , " Ghastly Crime , " or something like that . Here you must try to tell the story in the top of the head in two or three lines of type whichp117must count exactly and which must conform to the Tribune 's style . Each line of the head must contain as nearly a completestatement as possible . There is a set rule that the top line of the head must not end in a preposition or adverb or anything except a noun or a verb . The lines are counted by " units "  --  that is , each letter or character is a single unit except that " I " is half a unit , " M 's " and " W 's " are a unit and a half , and commas and other punctuationare a half unit . Spaces between words are counted as a half . I go to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12:30 . OCTOBER 10 , 1910 . I did not work tonight , having a severely wrenched back and a chill from a ducking in San Francisco Bay . The Hotel Dalt where I am living is frequented by theatricalpeople , mostly vaudeville actors and actresses . They are a very interesting , happy-go-lucky crew and frequently when I come home from work they are making merry in the rear lobby . After their performances many of them gather in this back lobby where there is a piano and have midnight lunches , beer and frolic . The musicians and dancers enjoy showing their new acts to brother and sister performers on the theory they will receive expert criticism and be able " to smooth out any rough spots . " But it does n't work out that way . It is all very odd . For instance , there is a pretty little English girl who is a vaudeville singer and for the gang she gets up and sings a song about , " Any little girl who 's a nice little girl is the right little girl for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with enthusiasm . They applaud and cheer and pound their beer mugs on the table . And a couple of other actresses rush up to the singer andp118they cry , " Darling , you 're marvelous . Just the right intonationsat the right places . Just the right cute little gestures . Why , darling , it must have taken you an age to work it all out so perfectly . Do n't see how you do it . " And the singer , flushed and pleased , says , " Oh , thank you , dear , you 're so kind . But I am conscious there are some rough spots that should be smoothed out . Could n't you suggest something ? It 's so difficult for me to judge my own work . " And the others clasp their hands and flutter their eyelids and say , " Why , darling , how can you feel there are any rough spots ? Any change at all would be a perfect crime . You 're just perfect now , really . " And then they move back to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one of them says , " My , do n't she flat terrible ? Never heard anything like it . Maybe she can get by on the Pantages with that stuff , but she would n't last a night on the Orpheum . " And the other says , " Is n't all that baby-baby stuff too sickeningfor words ? Say , I 've seen amateur shows where that gal would get the hook . " Then these two girls , who should know something about the way friendly criticism goes , get up and put on their sister dance act and hear the others say it 's one of the finest things of the ages and the little English singer and an acrobat come hack to the divan from their enthusiastic eulogy and talk in low tones about how awkward the " sisters " are and how they fake their steps . That 's the way it goes , but they are mostly nice people and quite interesting to me , for I never before knew any actors and actresses . I really prefer the actresses , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I remember something that George Tichnor said once in Kansas City that actresses and newspapermen were fine people , but heaven save him from actors and newspaper women . There may be something to that.  |p119Last  night I met a pretty little actress in the Dalt whose name is Flora McDonald . I asked her what theater she was at and she told me she was a moving-picture actress and was working then on a sea picture on a ship in the Bay . Pretty soon a man came up and spoke to Miss McDonald and he was John Boswell , one of the directors . Mr. Boswell asked me what I did and when I told him I was reading copy on the Tribune he said , " You work nights , do n't you ? " When I said I did he asked me how I 'd like to make $6 a day extra for a few hours in the morning . " We need extras , " he said , " and you might fit in fine . Why do n't you come along with us at ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . " Needing money as I do , that sounded splendid . And I 'll admit that the glamour of having a part in a motion picture , no matter how small a part , had its attractions also . So this morning I went down to the water front with Mr. Boswell and some of the other men and we were taken out in a motor launch to a freighter anchored in the Bay . Aboard the ship there was a great deal of confusion and several other extras and I were herded around a good deal like convicts . Finally I was given a black sweater somewhat too large for me and a seaman 's cap and told to put them on right away , which I did and then walked out on deck to see what was going on . Seeing Miss McDonald who also was wearing a sweater , I approached her and said , " Good morning , Miss McDonald , do I look seagoing enough ? " The haughty look she gave me would have frozen a polar bear . She turned her back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my status had changed entirely since the night before . Now I was a mere extra and less than the dust beneath this star 's feet . And I had , apparently , committed a cardinal sin by daring to speak to her . Then a blaring voice called all us extras forward , and we were a tough-looking crew indeed , dressed in ragged jerseysp120and shapeless trousers . Most of the men wore two or three days ' beard and their faces bore testimony of recent brawls . But I was to learn more of that later . One of the directors , wearing leather leggings and a cap , bawled out , " Who 's Zigler ? " " I am , " I said , stepping forward . He looked me over closely and then grunted , " Guess you 'll do  --  if they slap some grease paint on your face . Listen , you can swim , ca n't you ? " That last question should have been a hint to me , but I was so excited that it did not register . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Webb , but I can swim . " " All right , that 's enough . There 's a mutiny on this ship and there 's been a battle . Hans Petersen , the Grizzly of the Deep , is master of this vessel and he 's standing off the fo'c'sle singlehanded . You 're to sneak around the side of the galley with this knife and attack Petersen from the rear . Get it ? " " Yes , " I said , " but  --  " " Here , take this knife . " He handed me a murderous dagger with a blade eight inches long . " Now let 's see how you 'd sneak along here . " So I crouched low with the knife in my hand and tiptoed along the side of the cabin . " Do n't bend over so far , " he commanded . " We got to see your face . And do n't look so d  --  innocent . Look mean . You 're going to try to kill a man , not serve him with an icecreamsoda . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the corner of the galley Petersen will be there . You rush at him , but for G  --  ' s sake be careful with that knife . Pull it back this way like you were going to slash at him and he 'll grab your wrist and shake the knife out of your hand . Now we 'll try it . " So they had me sneak along the side of the galley and there sure enough was Petersen , a giant of a man muscled like George Hackenschmidt and naked to the waist . I rushed atp121him when the director yelled and Petersen caught my wrist easily and shook the knife from my hand . He grinned goodnaturedlyas he did it , but he whispered in my ear , " Listen , shrimp , you be careful of that blade when the cameras are grinding or I 'll break your G  --  d  --  neck  --  understand ? " " I 'll be careful , " I promised . Then they sent me back to my station around the galley and somebody yelled " Camera ! " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a little and with as fiendish an expression as I could summon to my face , crept along the wall , clutching the knife prominently in front of me . At the corner I peeked around and then rushed ferociously at the Grizzly of the Deep with the knife pulled back ready to strike . Petersen grabbed my wrist , but he did n't grab it easily as he did before . His huge hand seemed to be crushing the bones of my arm as he shook the knife clattering to the deck . Then he seized me bodily , swung me around so his own face was toward the camera and lifted me above his head with his two hands . For a moment he held me there so the cameras could register his tremendously swelling muscles . Then he threw me sprawling like a cat clear over the rail of the ship . It was not a large ship , but it must have been at least 15 feet to the water . I tried to turn in the air to hit the water in a dive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my back , which knocked the wind from me , but when I came strangling and struggling to the surface there was a motorboatnear by which came to my rescue . The crew was in paroxysms of laughter , but they finally managed to drag me aboard and transport me back to the deck of the ship . My back was wrenched so badly that I could scarcely stand straight , but the director came up laughing and patted me on the shoulder . " You did fine , Zigler , " he said . " You did just fine . You can go for today on the strength of that per/formance , but be back sure tomorrow . " Then he gave me my $6 . I had been wearing my own trousers , so I had to go ashore and take the streetcar back to Turk Street in dripping wet pants . As a consequence I took a chill which with my lame back , made me feel quite ill . This afternoon I telephoned Murphy and told him I was sick and unable to come to work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can tell anyone else who asks , however , that my career as a moving-picture actor is closed , finally and definitely . OCTOBER 25 , 1910 . I have sent Pearl $70 to pay her way to San Francisco and she will be here next week . Have looked around some for apartments but decided to wait until she gets here and let her do the selecting . Tuesday is my day off on the Tribune so this evening I wandered alone around the old Barbary Coast which they say is pretty tame now compared to the days before the fire . I went into a picturesque place near Broadway which apparentlyaims to provide every type of entertainment which a wandering man might desire . There is a saloon in the front . Off to one side is a penny arcade with many penny-in-the-slot motion-picture machines where one may turn a crank and see " High Jinks in the Dressing Room , " " Why Girls Go Wrong , " " The Gans-Nelson Prize Fight , " " In Room 202 , " and other rather salacious kinetographs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow with charts showing the scores of James J. Jeffries , Robert Fitzsimmons , James J. Corbett and other pugilists ; electric shocking machines ; weight-lifting machines ; handgripmachines ; and a device into which the customer wishing to prove his virility may blow and reveal the strength of his lungs . On the other side and to the rear is a dining room circledp123with booths where one may pull red velvet curtains and dine or drink in privacy with one of the shopworn nymphs who are part of the establishment 's staff . I dropped a few pennies in the slot machines , but did not find the motion pictures particularly exciting . I tried the punching bag and surprised myself by delivering a blow slightly harder than the one credited to Corbett although not quite so powerful as Jeffries ' record . This is particularly surprisingbecause I never have been athletically inclined and weigh only 128 in a moderately heavy suit and several silver dollars in my pocket . From the penny arcade I went forward again to the saloon and bought a stein of beer at the bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tables , mostly unsavory-looking characters , and I noticed casually that the group at one table was talking rather loudly . I was paying them no attention , however , while I sipped at my beer . Rather I was noticing the bartender who was middle-aged , bald , tight-lipped and bland . He was busy polishing beer glasses and I thought he had an interesting face , the face of a man who might be someone of importance instead of a bartender in such a place . I was thinking that I wished I knew his history , that he well might make a character in my book when a light chair sailed perilously close to my left ear and crashed terrifically into the glasses and bottles back of the bar . Immediately the loud talkers at the one table were engaged in a desperate , bottle-swinging fight and men rushed in from another table to take part . They were yelling , cursing , kicking , swinging fists and throwing everything in sight . Above the uproar the bartender said to me in an even , slightly bored voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before things get rough . " I thanked him , laid down my nickel and walked out . I do n't know what caused the free-for-all . I do n't know how it came out . I am only glad that I did not become involved ,  | despite the fact that the punching machine shows that I can hit harder than Corbett and almost as hard as Jeffries . Because of the dynamiting of the Los Angeles Times , the San Francisco Tribune which has n't been very friendly to Labor has put armed guards in and around the plant . At night nobody can enter the building without a pass . They issued cards to all the employees . Last night Phil Blackburn , one of the copyreaders , could n't get back to work after he 'd gone to lunch at ii o'clock because he had misplaced his card . JANUARY 10 , 1911 . This was my night off and I took Pearl to the movies . It was J. Warren Kerrigan , who Pearl thinks is great , in another Civil War picture . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground and I believe I had better omit the Civil War as a major point in my novel . Considering her condition , Pearl is feeling very well , but she does n't like San Francisco and is lonesome for her mother and old friends in Kansas City . We are living in a three-room apartment on O'Farrell Street . It is a four-story building built of redwood and painted gray of the type common in San Francisco . Of course it is n't very fine , but we have a front apartment with a bay window and it is quite comfortable . Pearl complains of the cold , for she is n't used to the chill fog and rain and the radiators in the apartment have only two segments to them . I try to tell her how fortunate she is to be in California and read her accounts of blizzards in the East and of the zero weather in Kansas City . " Well , " she says , " maybe it gets cold in Kansas City , but you can have a fire and keep warm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen . I know I have to make allowances for her irritability now and try to cheer her up all I can . It is most important that she keep in a happy frame of mind ,  |p125not  only for herself , but for my son . I feel certain , somehow , that the baby will be a boy . I want him named John or Thomas or William or some other good honest , unassuming name and I mean that he shall have all the opportunities a boy should have . I shall devote all the time I can to training him from babyhood up and he shall have a college education and postgraduate courses if necessary , even if I have to go without lunches from now on to pay for it . Pearl says she can tell the baby will be a girl and she is going to name her Gretchen Marguerite because her widowed Aunt Gretchen has money and would be flattered into making a bequest and because she , Pearl , always thought Marguerite was the prettiest of all names and the girl could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he just Marguerite Zigler . At the office Fred Waldron , the old telegraph editor , has been shifted to the Sunday department and the bald-headed Oliver McClelland , a copyreader , was made telegraph editor . It was plain for a long time that some shift would be necessarybecause of the antagonism between Waldron and Murphy , the tall , slim head of the copy desk . Murphy has been quite friendly to me and I had hoped he would recommend me for telegraph editor . I guess they figured that 011ie McClelland deserved the job more than I did , though . He has been on the Tribune copy desk for about three years . I really think I could do a better job of telegraph editing than 011ie , but it seems they have to consider seniority when making promotions . With the baby coming and all I could certainly use more money , but they have been pretty good to me on the Tribune and I do n't feel like asking for a raise . The fellows in Kansas City would be surprised to hear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , I think , would Colonel Nelson , who ordered me fired as incompetent . I have been trying to get Pearl interested in reading , butp126so far it has been unsuccessful . Once in a while she will read a story in the Ladies ' Home journal if it is written by Grace S. Richmond . But she wo n't read the Saturday Evening Post , which I believe is printing the best stuff written today . Just before Christmas I read Pearl a story in the Post which I can not forget . It was called " The Exit of Anse Dugmore " and was by a new writer named Irvin S. Cobb who has the faculty of describing details more vividly than any writer 1 have ever read , and that includes such old masters as Dickens and modern masters as Irving Bacheller . The story concerned a Kentucky feud and the hero dies tragically before he accomplisheshis purpose ; i.e. , killing his enemy . I was so enthusiasticover this tale that I had to read it aloud to Pearl . But I am sorry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing were lost on her . Her comment was , " Why write such gloomy things ? Is n't there enough sorrow and trouble in the world without makingit up ? Why do n't they write things to make people feel better ? That story makes me feel unhappy and it is n't good for me to feel unhappy in my condition . You ought to have thought of that before you read me that awful thing . " There undoubtedly is a great deal to what Pearl says , but nevertheless my own naturally gloomy nature makes me revel in stories like that . I hope this Irvin S. Cobb will write a lot more . FEBRUARY I , 1911 . I have been reading Rex Beach 's " Silver Horde " which I was lucky enough to get from the library . It is a story of salmon fishing in Alaska . It is a very exciting tale and well done . Also it gives a new picture of the Northland . From Jack London we see Alaska only as a place of extreme cold and super-human heroism under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the subarctic and while he does not rob the land of its romance , he makes it seem slightly more real.  |p127My  dreams of Frances have started again . It is very strange . I have made a strong effort to shut her from my mind . I know my duty lies with Pearl and her baby and with them alone . I have sternly closed the book of Frances Harbach in my thoughts , knowing I shall never see her or hear from her again . Yet in my dreams she is as she was before I left Buffalo and our relations are those of sweethearts . I say they are the same , but there is a difference . The difference is that I seem to be looking at her life today . There is a strange sense of the thing actually happening just as I dream it . For instance , last night was my night off . It was a bad , rainy night and as Pearl was n't feeling very well we did not go out . About 7 o'clock in the evening I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I suddenly became very drowsy . That is no reflection on the book , for I have been working quite hard and have to get up fairly early in the morning to take Pearl for a walk or streetcar ride when the weather permits . I was not conscious that I had gone to sleep in the chair until I awoke and I could not have slept more than five minutes . But in that brief period I had this oddly realistic dream . I saw Fran in her bedroom . I saw every article of furniture , plainly , including her dresser with my picture in a frame . Fran was in her nightgown and was sitting before the mirror combing her beautiful yellow hair . I seemed to be looking over her shoulder and could see her face reflected in the mirror . She seemed very sad . When she had finished with her hair she walked to her bed and knelt in prayer and I heard her sweet voice say very plainly , " Oh , God , please take care of Homer , wherever he may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad . " Then I awoke and it seemed that I could smell the faint unidentifiable perfume that was characteristic of Frances . I say it was a little after 7 o'clock . Well , in Buffalo it then was a little after io . I have a feeling that Fran actually was going to bed at that time . While of course I never have seen her room , I have a feeling that it is arranged as I saw it . And I have a feeling which amounts to a conviction that the scene I visioned , that the prayer I heard , occurred at that moment just as it was in the dream . My first inclination when swept away by emotion was to sit down immediately and write her a letter . But calm reason came to my rescue . I knew that would be foolhardy . I knew that would start everything over again and I who am to be a father soon certainly can not play false to my child 's mother . And calm reason tells me there can not be anything to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too sensible to ruin her life mourning over me . Perhaps even now she has married Paul Clark or some other worthy man . While I dislike Clark extremely , I must admit he is worthy in the eyes of the world . He probably could make Frances happy and I do want her to be happy . For , after all , what right have I to hold jealous feelings in that direction ? I have long ago forfeited all claims on Frances . While to some extent dreams are uncontrollable , I must not allow myself to be upset by them . I must wipe this sentimentalfoolishness from my mind if I am ever to be happy . MARCH 2 , 1911 . The great news in San Francisco today is the sentencing of Abe Ruef to 14 years in San Quentin . I : or a great many years Abe Ruef was political boss of the city and was nominal head of a most corrupt machine . He was in league with the notorious Mayor Schmitz who is supposedto have made away with money contributed for relief following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was indicted on 129 counts on charges of bribery , extortion and what not . In the battle over these charges a prosecuting attorney was shot . Finallyp129the Supreme Court has ruled that Ruef must serve his sentenceand he has been taken to prison . All the San Francisco papers express jubilation over Ruef 's punishment . The Tribune , however , says , " It is only unfortunatethat the worst villain of the gang escaped . Ruef was boss , but at least he had some human dualities . " The Chronicle came right out and maned names , saying , " Schmitz is a villain pure and simple , utterly sordid , faithlessto every trust , with no qualities to attach any man to him in the bonds of friendship , selling himself in cold blood to any buyer . " There is a general feeling that there are a number of rich men up on Nob Hill who used both Schmitz and RudE to debauch the city government and who should be imprisoned along with Ruef . But they have even more power than Ruef to escape prosecution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspicuous . Ruef was sentenced specifically on a charge of bribing a supervisor named Furey . And he showed himself to be a game fellow by the interview he gave at San Quentin . He declared he expected to find his stay at San Quentin very interesting and nowhere as unpleasant as some people might think . " As a matter of fact , " he said , " I expect to find San Quentin something of a Utopia . Every one here is on the same level . Here everyone must do his allotted share of the work  --  which is part of the dream of every advanced Socialist . " Referring to his badly fitting striped suit , he remarked : " It 's merely the association of the fact with the idea that causes people to think of a prison uniform with horror . But there actually is nothing wrong with this suit . " The zebra is no less beautiful than the horse , for instance . With the zebra the stripes are an adornment . They increase his value . " Now if a company of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am wearing they would be admired and thought fine looking and the uniform would be praised . I feel no shame in wearing it because my conscience is easy . " If Ruef is glad to be in prison that makes it practically unanimous . MARCH 26 , 1911 . For some time American and Canadian officials have been working toward establishment of tariff reciprocity . Being a native of Buffalo , that has interested me much more than the San Franciscans . I can appreciate the great importance this would hold to American business . But it appears now that the chances of reciprocity have been ruined by a childish act on the part of a man who has been boomed as a great American leader . Champ Clark , congressman from Missouri , has been selected by the Democratic majority in the House as next Speaker . There is talk that he will be the Democratic nominee for the presidency next year . In the House last week , during the debate on Canadian reciprocity , Clark gained the floor and spoke strongly and with great feeling in favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utterance of any public man ( not even excludingTaft and Theodore Roosevelt ) in the last twenty years . " Reciprocity , " said Clark , " will be a long step toward realization of America 's great dream . It will be a move toward realization of my hope to see the day when the American flag will float over every square foot of the British North American possessions north of the American possessions clear to the North Pole . " And there were certain congressmen ignorant enough of Canadian sentiment to cheer him . Of course the inevitable has happened . The Canadians have shied away from the reciprocity plan . Great Britain isp131incensed and the whole project is collapsing . Anyone who knows anything about Canadians knows they do not want to be Americans . They want to retain their identity rather than to be swallowed up by their mastodonic neighbor . They are proud of being a part of a great empire and any man with brains enough to be Speaker of the House should have known this and guarded his tongue . I should say now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his own undisciplined oratory . And I can just imagine what the Buffalo papers are saying  --  especially the Republican Morning Journal . APRIL 9 , 1911 . At 5 o'clock this Sunday morning I became the father of a seven-pound boy . He was born at the I HinemannHospital and the doctor says he is perfect in every respect . Pearl is in good condition , and , according to the doctor , had an exceptionally easy time . She does n't agree with the doctor , which I suppose is natural enough . I got home shortly before 3 o'clock this morning , bringing her a frankfurter sandwich . Lately she has been wanting savory things to eat early in the morning and I have been bringing her cartons of chili or hamburger sandwiches or hot dogs from an all-night joint on the way home . When I got in this morning , however , she was awake andin her bathrobe . She was crying when I entered the bedroom . " You 're late , " she accused , " where have you been ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " I just stopped to getyou this nice hot dog . " " I do n't want any hot dog . I want to go to the hospital right now . " She doubled up with pain . I dropped the sandwich on the table and ran downstairs to the phone in the hall and called a taxicab . Then I started to all the doctor to arrange things at Hahnemann Hospital , but did n't have another nickel nor even a dime and had to drop a quarter in the phone in order to get Central . I was too excited even to try to get the operator to return the change . It seemed hours before the taxi arrived . Pearl was in agony and I was afraid the baby would be born there in the apartmentwithout medical attention . I kept looking out the front window at the street , glistening from wet fog in the dim lights and finally I heard the screech of brakes outside and there was the yellow cab parking outside the apartment . Pearl did n't think she could walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I got to the landing and the taxi driver , a big burly fellow , met us there . " Here , pal , let me take her , " he said , and carried Pearl quite easily to the cab . We sailed up to the hospital quickly with Pearl complainingI had forgotten the suitcase she had packed and me telling her not to worry , that I 'd go right back to the apartment and get it . All she had on was her nightgown and bathrobe and slippers and she had a right to complain . I was so excited I did n't even notice the suitcase standing ready in the bedroom . I really am delighted that the baby is a boy . I know I 'm going to have some great times when he is big enough to play with . And I am going to give him all the opportunities that I missed . I shall not attempt to warp him out of his own orbit , but I shall try to interest him in developing himself along worth-while lines while he is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall try to interest him in becoming a scientist or political leader , for the world 's progressdcpcnds on those lines . Just as soon as the doctor 's bill is paid I am going to start saving money diligently for the little fellow 's education . An ordinary college education will not be enough . He shall go to one of the best universities in the country  --  Harvard or Yale or Princeton or perhaps the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , if he would be an engineer . And I shall see that he also gets a postgraduate degree . I shall see that he gets all the training it is humanlyp133possible to give a boy . Perhaps he may have no reason to be proud of his dad when he grows up , but at least he shall know his father gave him a chance . Pearl wants him named Byron . I do n't care particularly for that name as it seems somewhat pretentious . But after all she is the mother and she wanted a girl . So who is a mere father to offer objections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to By . I am rather tired , having been up all day , but it is time to go to work . On the copy desk these days I am handling the Mexican situation . Serious trouble is threatening because of the battles near the border between Mexican federals and rebels . And day before yesterday 20,000 American troops were ordered to the Texas border . If some of these Americans should get killed war would be inevitable . MAY 16 , 1911 . This was my night off so I got up early today and went shopping in the secondhand stores to get a baby buggy for little Byron . I found a dandy for $5 that would pass practically for new . Then this afternoon Pearl and I took him for a ride up to California Street and clear over to Laurel Hill Cemetery and back . It is nicer up on California and we are going to try to find an apartment up there . Byron is beginning to get cute , but he cries a lot . The doctor has recommended changing him to condensed milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home in the morning he wakes up and begins to howl so I change him and heat him a bottle of milk . Then , like as not he develops the colic and I have to walk the floor with him an hour or so . One thing I am certain of  --  he has fine lungs . I believe he is going to look like Pearl , but it is too early to be sure . I certainly hopep134he does n't look like his daddy  --  I would n't want that to happen to any child . A new danger is developing from aeroplanes . Ordinarily they only kill the aeronaut and whoever is foolish enough to go for a ride in the sky . But in Paris an aviator crashed into a crowd , killing Minister of War Berteaux and seriously injuring Premier Monis . There is one bright spot at least in the news . At last the government has got next to the Standard Oil Company  --  and during a Republican administration at that . The United States Supreme Court has ordered the greatest of all trusts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the street does not realize what important news this is to the common people . It foreshadows the death of all great American monopolieswhich have been growing bigger and bigger and gaining actual control of the government . This Supreme Court order actually means the death of special privilege and returning of the government to the people . JUNE 4 , 1911 . I have been guilty of a very foolish thing and as a consequence Pearl will scarcely speak to me . We found a much nicer apartment on California Street near Devisadero for only $17.5o and we are paying $35 for our present place where some of the neighbors have said unkind things about the baby crying . We had decided to take the California place and were going to make a deposit today , yesterday being payday . Things are always slow on Sunday morning after midnightand somebody pulled out a deck of cards on the copy desk about 12:30 . We started playing penny-ante poker , and somehow the limit worked up to 50 cents and when the game broke up at 4 o'clock I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to follow the usual course and to have told Pearl some cock-and-bull story about losing the money or being held up . Or perhaps it would havep135been better to borrow the money and say nothing at all , paying it back out of my lunch money . It seemed , however , better to come out frankly and confess , which I did . I had no idea Pearl 's anger could reach such heights . She called me things which I never before have been called in my life . She called me names that I slid not know she had ever heard . And I could n't reply in kind for I had to admit her tirade was largely justified . Now we have to stay here on O'Farrell Street where we can put the landlord off a week or so and let the California Street place go . Well , at least I have learned my lesson even if I did have to pay dearly for it . NOVEMBER 7 , 1911 . The baby is sick with a cold so I shall use part of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now is nearly seven months old . He has two teeth and can sit up alone . He also does a lot of talking in his own language and is so cute women notice him and smile at him when I am pushing him up and down the hills in his buggy . Since summer we have been living in a better apartment we found on Devisadero near California . The neighbors are much better here and there is a nice young woman named Castro on the second floor who is glad to take care of the baby for 50 cents when we want to go out on my night off . I am still working on the rim of the copy desk , but my pay has been raised to $35 . That is a great help and I am making an effort to save a little against a rainy day . I have managed to pay off the doctor and hospital bill for Byron and now have a savings account with a nest egg of $15 , to which I intend to add at least a dollar or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $12 . Two weeks ago I was lured into a draw poker game on Sunday morning . I resolved firmly to pull out and go home if I lost as much as $2 . But luck was with me and I came out of the game $13 .. 15 winner . I have spent $1.15 for beer  --  a luxury I have had to deny myself since before the baby came . The $12 I am saving for emergencies . For instance it could stake me in another poker game , but I shall insist on any game I enter being held to a dime limit . My conscience does not hurt me in keeping these things from Pearl . Living in such close quarters , a man can have little enough privacy from his wife . It is so with the old ledger in which I have been keeping these notes . While Pearl has shown little or no curiosity about my plans to write , I feel constrained to keep this big old book locked in my trunk . Invariably I have written this record while she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , if I did not keep it locked Pearl might come across it someday and her curiosity might prompt her to dig into this intimate record . I know that would cause friction . The most astounding and happiest news of years is the proclamation of the Chinese Republic . The ancient sleeping giant has awakened and set a fine example to some of the supposedly more enlightened nations of Europe . Now the downtrodden millions of China will come to their own . Now the immensely rich resources of that great country at last will be tapped . Now the increasing menace of Japan in the Pacific will he dampened , for as a republic China will take her place among the most powerful nations in the world , let alone in Asia . Many people do not understand the Chinese and consider them stupid . I believe that is true even in San Francisco where 30,000 Orientals live . But the Chinese are not stupid as a general thing . Whenever I have opportunity I go down Grant Avenue into Chinatown and walk by the exotic bazaars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have found them stoically uncommunicative for the most part , but now and then I run across a genial yellow man who displays surprising intelligenceand a fine grasp of the affairs of the world.  |p137Soon  after we came here I took Pearl into Chinatown but because of her condition the strange odors of the place nauseatedher and she has refused steadfastly to accompany me there again . Beyond Chinatown are the Spanish and Italian colonies which are most colorful , but Pearl has little use for " Dagos " and will not eat in any of these Latin cafes where one may dine so cheaply . " American restaurants are good enough for me , " she says , " and I want to know I 'm eating clean food . " I believe she 'd rather starve then eat in a Chinese restaurant . And , although it is one of the best places in town , she balked flatfooted against entering the famous Flytrap Cafe just because of the name . The original Flytrap was destroyed by the fire and it may have justified the implication , but its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Marks of the fire and earthquake still are plain in many sections of the city and I do n't suppose they ever will be entirely wiped out . There are vacant lots hidden by billboards here and there , and if you peek behind the billboards you see heaps of brick and charred timber that have been untouched since 1906 . Talk to any native for an hour or so and he is almost certain to bring the conversation around to " the fire " and tell about his own experiences . Everything is dated as " Before the fire " or " After the fire . " And when you have heard a number of stories , you do n't wonder . Really it is amazing that there are so few signs of the disaster after only five and a half years . I have read a number of books recently , three of which were outstanding . First I should list Jeffrey Farnol 's " The Broad Highway . " Next is " The Winning of Barbara Worth " by Harold Bell Wright ; and " Queed " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really is a marvelous work . It has everything --  -- glamour , adventure , romance and characters that are no wooden puppets , but real living persons . I really should hold it to be a great book and one that will live . It made a profound impression on me . The sense of movement and atmosphere that Farnol imprisoned in his pages is something for me to study . I shall get it from the library again and read it more slowly and try to analyze his methods . " The Winning of Barbara Worth " is more of a love story than the conquering of the desert . But Wright also has written a glamorous story . I found myself displeased that Willard Holmes , the slick engineer , finally won Barbara rather than Abe Lee , the rough-and-ready , honest young man of the desert . Perhaps that prejudiced me against the novel , but I must admit the author did a competent job . I do not think Harold Bell Wright has the artistry of Farnol , however . " Queed " is a newspaper story . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true with me . I wish Irvin S. Cobb would write a novel . APRIL 16 , 1912 . It does n't seem that I have much time these days for anything but work and entertaining the family . Usually I take Pearl to a picture show on my night ofd while we leave Byron with Mrs. Castro . Byron was a year old on the 9th and is really a cute , smart baby . He crawls all over the apartment and can stand up by hanging to a chair . Also he jabbers something which Pearl says is " mama . " Ile is blue-eyed like his mother and has curly , yellow hair . We did n't go to a show tonight because Mrs. Castro is sick with a had cold and we did n't have any other place to leave the baby . That is why I have time to review things . One of the most terrible tragedies in history occurred Sundaynight . The new White Star liner Titanic making her maiden voyage from Liverpool to New York struck an iceberg and sank , carrying almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been advertised as absolutely unsinkable because of her watertight compartments . For that reason , apparently , there were not enough lifeboats for 2,202 passengers and crew . There will be an investigation of that point and also as to why such a ship should sink so quickly after striking an iceberg . John Jacob Astor was one of those who died . Harrowing stories have been coming over the wires from survivors who were picked up by the steamer Carpathia ever since the disaster . The Carpathia was brought to the scene by wireless CQD 's from the Titanic after the great liner had struck the berg . This alone marks wireless telegraphy as probably the greatest invention of this age . The world should honor the Italian Marconi , who invented it . There was one ludicrous angle to the Titanic in the Tribune office . It was a very dull night for news and Jimmy Albertson , the news editor , was holding a conference with Pete Van Camp , the city editor , and Phil Blackburn , the new telegraph editor , over what story he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a Kearny Street rooming house and Blackburn said he did n't have anything much . Then Blackburn looked over his copy again and squinted through his glasses at a bulletin and said , " Well , Jimmy , if you have n't got anything else  --  you know this new liner , the Titanic , biggest ship afloat ? " Albertson was just getting out a new cigarette . " Yeah , " he said . " Well , " went on Blackburn , " it 's on its maiden voyage from Liverpool to New York . " " Yeah , " said Albertson , lighting a match . " I got a bulletin about the Titanic here that says she wirelessedshe 'd struck an iceberg and was in danger of sinking . " Albertson dropped both the match and cigarette . " Great G  --  ! " he shouted loud enough to be heard clear out on Market Street . He leaped from his chair , yelling for a boyp140to get pictures of the liner from the morgue . And late as it was we had an extra on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfaction to me in that little drama . Albertson knew I wanted the telegraph job , but when 011ie McClelland went to Los Angeles a month ago , he selected Blackburn for the job . I hope he 's satisfied with his selection now . I hope he likes Blackburn 's news judgment . The biggeststory in years laid in his lap and he thought it might do for an eight-column line if they did n't have " anything else . " I have been strangely depressed all day over another of my dreams about Frances . Today , I feel certain , was her wedding day . I saw her as plainly as I have ever seen anybody while awake and she was dressed as a bride . The dream had little continuity , but was a mere series of very sharp pictures . But the pictures told the story . First she was in her room , the room I have seen several times in my dreams . I know this room almost as well as I know our own apartment . I know her bureau and commode and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flowered rug and the lace curtains on the two windows and the pictures on the wall and my own framed photograph , which heretoforehas been resting on the bureau beside the mirror . In the first picture I noticed particularly that my photographwas missing from its accustomed place . Frances was sitting before the mirror combing her hair . Then she was garbed in a white satin gown with trailing veil and was being fussed over by two girls whom I could not recognize . The next picture was a shifting confusion of music and crowds and flowers , but in it I caught one glimpse of Frances looking very beautiful and carrying a huge bouquet of hothouseroses . So far I had seen nothing of the bridegroom nor had any hint of his identity . But the next picture was of the Exchangep141Street railway station . There was a crowd of people in the old building . It seemed that I could recognize some of them , but they were all slightly out of locus and I identified no one . Then there was Frances dressed in a gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was much laughter and raillery . Clark looked much the same as he did six years ago , but was about twenty pounds heavier . He seemed to have grown thicker in the neck and waist . Then the train was in and there was the traditional shower of rice and Frances and Clark entered the car . I have no idea where they were going . Of course this all could be merely the workings of my perfervidimagination . It may be final proof that I am silly and in a class with the women who go to fortunetellers , but I cannotbut believe Frances actually has married Clark . Certainly I never have wished anything to happen to Pearl , but heretofore I have held hope in the back of my head that someway , somehow , sometime Frances and I should he brought together again . I have not dared actually to think that thought . It merely has been an unexpressed hope in the inner recesses of my being . Now that unthought thought is shattered . I feel certain that tonight Frances is on her honeymoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I ca n't bear to think of it . I know it is ridiculous for me to feel this way . I 'm afraid my emotional nature is not as sane as it should be . APRIL 18 , 1912 . I am now telegraph editor of the San FranciscoTribune . Phil Blackburn was given a terrible bawling out on the Titanic story by Albertson and Rothstein and when Blackburndeclared he was " just kidding " Rothstein got mad and put me on the telegraph desk and fired Blackburn . I have the job officially enough  --  as long as it lasts  --  butp142nothing has been said about raising my pay . I am willing to let things stand as they are until they see I can make good . There is really something thrilling about the job . There is a greater sense of doing something important than any other work I have ever done . We have the complete service of the Associated Press and World-Wide Press which means practically that wires stretch out from my desk to every state in the Union and to every nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire break out in Singaporeor an anarchist assassinate a Balkan prince , word would be brought me with the speed of lightning . I probably should know of the assassination before the newspapers were out in the prince 's home city . I probably should know about it before members of the prince 's own family were told . When you stop to consider it , there is a grave responsibility connected with having the whole world laid in your lap every night . For the telegraph editor must decide the relative worth of all these thousands and thousands of words . What will interestSan Francisco most ? That is the thing I must keep uppermost in my mind . What are the possible repercussions here in San Francisco of a Supreme Court decision in Washingtonon sugar ? A coal mine strike in Colorado is of great interest some places . But little coal is used here . Therefore a coal mine strike would not be a candidate for Page One unless there was a great deal of violence . The way we work is this : I come on at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flimsy carbon copies of the day reports . I go through these and separate all copy on the main stories and put it in copy paper folders which I label " Congress , " " Strike , " " Balkans , " and whatever else is happening . 1 keep these carbon copies of the day reports to augment the night wire , if necessary , for quite often there are important angles in the day reports which are not repeated in the night reports . For instance , when the President delivers a messagep143to Congress or any other important speech is made , the text will be carried on one wire and not repeated . Also from the day report I will select quite a number of " shorts "  --  little freak features , deaths and the like , which I will mark up for two line 14-point heads or one line 6-point black heads as fillers , especially for the first edition . It is always difficult to find enough good " shorts " for the first edition nd it would be practically impossible without the day reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports news and stick it on the sport editor 's spindle . The same with financial news for the financial editor . It takes me about an hour to get this mass straightened out and at 3 o'clock the night wires open and copy boys begin to bring me " hard copy " or the original typescript from the telegraph operators ' typewriters . I not only keep track of all that is going on in the world and pick out possible stories for Page One , which arc weeded out each edition by the news editor together with the possible Page One material selected by the city editor from local news , but I judge the merits of all telegraph matter to appear on the inside pages , designate the length to be used and mark the type of head  --  although I sometimes confer with Jimmy Albertson over this . Also I edit and trim down a good bit of this copy myself and write heads on a certain amount of it , together with writing " dash matter " or background stuff on some stories which will follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real job and I am very excited over it . Heretofore I have been regarding my newspaper work more or less as a steppingstone to something else . I have consideredit preparation for my real lifework of writing truly important novels . Now I am wondering if I have not made a mistake . Nothing could be more important than being a really competent newspaper executive . It is the daily press , after all , which influences public thought . A paper like the Tribune , for instance , with nearly 200,000 circulation may be read byp144half a million people daily . How many novelists can hope for an audience like that ? Besides , the newspaperman is dealing with living things , with reality . And the novelist usually is dealing with mere figments of his imagination and not burning questions of the day . Someday in the distant future I shall write a book or several books . But now I shall devote my energies to making myself the best possible newspaperman . I shall endeavor to be the best telegraph editor the Tribune ever had . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk . Then I shall hope to become managing editor and finally publisher . High newspaper executives make fine money . I know I have it in me to become a high executive . I shall be able to save a good deal of money , live comfortably , give Byron a good college education . Then , by investing my savings judiciouslyin first mortgages and gilt-edge securities , I shall be able to retire when I am in my early fifties and devote myself to literature . Pearl approves this plan heartily and , after all , I must admit Pearl has a pretty level head . Sometimes I have regarded her as overmaterial in her thoughts . But that is woman 's way . And it is nothing more than good , common sense . She was happy over my promotion , but thought I should demand a raise in salary immediately . I convinced her , however , that I should lose nothing by failing to appear anxious on that score . I shall , however , continue keeping notes on my experiences and thoughts , which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have time to write . I got a letter from Mother today . She is in Kenmore helpingmy sister Ethel have a baby . Ethel came through all right and has a little girl they have named Harriet . Ethel is married to a Kenmore jeweler named Arthur Hodge . I have never seen him.  |p145Mother  has been out in the " Fruit Belt " of Buffalo visiting some of the old neighbors , but she did n't mention the Harbachs . As a matter of fact , she only knew Mrs. Harbach casually , but it seems she is rather going out of her way not to mention Frances . Mother likes Buffalo better than Pittsburgh , but Father does n't . He likes his job there and is making much more money than he could have got from the Queen City Brass Works in Buffalo . OCTOBER 17 , 1912 . Thursday is my night off now , but Pearl and I did not go out tonight . Mrs. Castro , with whom we leave Byron , is quite ill with a cold and Pearl knows nobody else she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been happening and I usually am too tired when I get home from work to write anything in this record . The last big story was the attempt of a crank in Milwaukee to assassinate Theodore Roosevelt . The man , John Schrank of New York , perhaps had good intentions for the country at large but was most ill-advised . Also , the Roosevelt luck held . Schrank was only six or seven feet distant when he fired at T.R. with a heavy revolver . The bullet struck Roosevelt in the chest . It passed through a bulky manuscript of a speech , through the Colonel 's glasses case and into his chest . It inflicted only a flesh wound and Roosevelt , with a great display of fortitude , was able to deliver his speech . Then he was taken to Chicago and placed in a hospital . The whole incident was made to order for Roosevelt and should bring him many votes . Many things have happened politically this summer . To begin with , the Republican national convention repudiatedthe great T.R. by ignoring his attacks on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President . No doubt that was poor political strategy , for Taft is amaz/ingly unpopular . But Roosevelt showed himself to be something less than the good sport he claims to be by bolting from the convention and holding a convention of his own . He formed what he calls the Progressive Party , which has been nicknamed the " Bull Moose Party . " The Bull Moose platform sounds rather good , calling as it does for the recall and referendum  --  even to the recall of judicialdecisions and recall of the judiciary . One can not , however , fail to be suspicious . Senator Hiram Johnson was nominated as T.R. 's running mate on the Bull Moose ticket and he should bring the party many votes in California , for Johnson is immensely popular here . The Democratic convention in Baltimore , thanks to William Jennings Bryan , nominated Governor Woodrow Wilson of New Jersey  --  a capable and high-minded gentleman . Mr. Bryan was a delegate from Nebraska and instructed for Speaker of the House Champ Clark . At the outset it appeared that Clark probably would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican Party hopelessly split and with Taft 's bad record to work on , the Democrats have the best chance of electing a President they have held since Grover Cleveland . No doubt Champ Clark could be elected . But I personally , remembering his terrible blunder on Canadian reciprocity , was afraid he lacked proper judgment to sit in the White I louse . Who could know when he might make a similar blunder which might precipitate serious international complications ? It was such a blunder that turned the tide against him . In the midst of the convention battle , Clark made concessions to Tammany in order to gain the strong New York support And Bryan , long a foe of the Tammany Tiger , rose to his feet . This , to his mind  --  and properly too  --  was sufficient cause for him as a delegate to repudiate his instructions.  |p147The  Great Commoner launched into an extemporaneous speech which was scarcely second to his " Cross of Gold " speech of 1896 and swept the convention into roars of enthusiasm . Bryan switched his support from Clark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who failed three times to reach the White House himself , at least can be credited with making a DemocraticPresident , who I predict will prove one of the finest and greatest ever to be elected . I say this because I believe Wilson 's election is practically a foregone conclusion . I do not believe Taft has a chance . And I actually believe Rooseveltwill run ahead of the Republican ticket . We have seen the death of Republicanism , of special privilegeand national boodle . I am now making $40 a week and they seem well pleased with my work as telegraph editor . We have bought a new phonograph , a Victor , which is vastly superior to our old two-horned Duplex . I bought a number of Sousa band recordswhile Pearl selected some popular music such as " Raggy Rag , " " You Great Big Beautiful Doll , " " Mysterious Rag , " and " Alexander 's Ragtime Band . " That last is one of the catchiest pieces I ever heard . The newsboys on the streets are whistling it and when lulls come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Come on and hear  --  " in a tenor voice . Then big-chested Tom Rogers will bear down with a bass , " Come on and hear  --  " Then four or five will chime in on "  --  Alex-an-der 's Ragtime Band . " They 'll repeat the " Come on and hears " and then chorus , " It 's the best band in the land . " Freddie Simpson will tenor , " They can play a bugle call like you never heard before , " and Rogers will bass it , " So natur-al that you want to go to war , " and so on until Mr. Rothstein sticks his head out his office door , scowling . That quiets things for then , but after the next edition it starts all over again.  |p148S|peaking  of Tom Rogers , he and I had an odd experience the other night after work . Frequently he and I will go up to Tait 's or Kyne 's for a lunch after work . He is a fine conversationalist and has had 20 years ' experience working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hawaiian Islands . He probably would be a managing editor or publisher some place if it were n't for his wanderlust and love for liquor . He has lost many jobs because of drunken escapades , but as he is about 40 now he is becoming more steady . Rogers and I were walking up Ellis Street at about 2 o'clock in the morning . The street was quiet and a block off Market nobody was in sight except a young girl who was leaning disconsolately against a lamppost . She was not more than 19 or 20 , but while her clothing was of good quality , she seemed somewhat disheveled . She looked at us with a bewildered expression as we approachedand Rogers said , " Hi , Sis  --  out kind of late , are n't you ? " The girl straightened . " Gentlemen , " she said , " time is only relative . And is n't it safe to be up while you 're still out ? " " My young friend , " said Rogers , " it 's our business to be out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bats and the burglars . We circulate only when honest folk sleep . " " All , " said the girl , rolling her large eyes upward , " just denizens of the shadows . Well , it 's my business to be here , there , everywhere at all times . You do n't know it , of course , but I 'm royalty . You do n't know me , but I know you . You 're Mutt and Jeff . And where in h  --  are you going at this hour ? " " Up to Kyne 's , " I told her , " after a bite to eat before bed . " The girl shook her head . " I could n't possibly accompany you to bed , " she drawled dreamily , " but I might honor you with my company as far as the restaurant  --  if I could have a waffle with sausage and coffee . "  | " You can have a waffle and sausage and coffee and also maple syrup , " Rogers promised . So the girl pushed herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine and walked between us the block to the restaurant . We took a booth and the girl sat with Rogers on one side of the table . I faced them . " What 's this royalty talk ? " I asked her . I thought she was drunk , which was not entirely correct . But there was somethingunusual about her . And she spoke like an educated person . She smiled enigmatically into my eyes . " One never knows , does one ? " she drawled . " F'r instance you never dreamed this morning that you should dine with royalty tonight . " " Nope , " I said . " One never knows . And what royal house do you happen to represent ? " " Did you ever , " she asked , " hear of Betty Butzer ? " " Not the Betty Butzer ? " said Rogers with simulated awe in his voice . She smiled and put a long forefinger coyly to the tip of her chin . The fingernail was dirty . " The one and only daughter of the Sawdust King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sawdust Princess , " said Rogers . " My , my . " " The one and only , " she said , " and might I ask the identity of my charming hosts ? " " You 'd never think it , " said Rogers , " but we 're twin brothers . " He pointed at me with a stubby thumb . " His name is Philander Chase Knox and my name is Philander Chase Knox . You can call us both Philly for short . " " I bet you were cute babies , " observed the girl . " But you 'd never guess where I have been tonight . " " The sewers of Paris , " hazarded Rogers . " Not even close , " said she . " At one o'clock this afternoon I was conferring with His Holiness , the Pope . " " You made a quick trip back . "  | " At four o'clock this afternoon , " she continued , " I was having tea with His Royal Highness , the Prince of Wales . " She shook her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The waiter came to our booth . The Sawdust Princess turned on him . " Garcon , " she said , " bring me filet mignon et green onions et two dishes of fresh strawberries and a demitasse . " " Bring her , " boomed Rogers , " a waffle and sausage and a mug of java . What you want , Philander Chase ? " " That 'll do for me , " I said . " Make it three and make it snappy , " ordered Rogers . " Now what about the Prince of Wales ? " " You 'd never believe it , " observed the girl , " if I told you how many chests of diamonds and rubies and pearls and emeralds I own . " " That 's right , " said Rogers , " to say nothing of your sapphiresand opals and amethysts and topazes . " She laughed and rested her elbows on the table . " It 's such a responsibility . Sometimes I 'm so weary I could cry . Do you know I often do cry ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew Betty Butzer cried . What would happen on the Bourse ? What would happen on the Bund ? Suppose you told . Suppose the word was flashed around the world . Suppose in the streets of Christiania and Constantinopleit was whispered through the shadows  --  Betty Butzer is a weak , human woman after all . At first the incredible thought would be rejected . Preposterous , preposterous , ' they 'd say . ' I lien they would wonder and perhaps believe , and it would mean death to thousands , perhaps millions . It would mean death to you in all probability . But no , it must never be known  --  never , never , never . " Her eyes were blazing at me . " Do you know who my husband is ? " she demanded . I shook my head . " I could n't guess . " " Not Cardinal Gibbons ? " hazarded Rogers.  | " I have no husband , " she murmured . " No husband , no husband . His name was Michelangelo . He thought he was an artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babies , babies . So I shot him there in our hovel on the left bank of the Seine . I killed him and left him surrounded by tubes of paint and brushes and paintings of God . God is sacred . No paint-daubed artist has a right to ask God to climb on his model 's stand . He 'd paint Inc in the nude , but it was wrong to ask God to take off his clothes . It was wrong because he would call God bow-legged , too . I know . And besides , he wanted babies . So I shot him and it was Gocl 's work . Works of God oft remind us Life is but a hollow dream . But Jesus knows where he can find us , pulling hard against the stream . That 's poetry . I made it up coming here from London tonight . Ah , me ! London today , Frisco tonight , ' Loki() to-morrow . " " On the level , Betty , " I said , " what do you do for a living ? Do your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me haughtily . " I , " she said , " am the daughter of the Sawdust King . " " On the level , Betty , " said Rogers , " do you sniff it or shoot it ? " " You 've never heard of my aeroplane , have you ? " she asked . " Of course you have n't . It 's quite a secret . Naturally , His Royal Highness , the Prince of Wales , knows I have an aeroplane , but he has n't an idea how good it is . Took him for a ride once or twice but I had my chauffeur slow it down to about a hundred miles a hour . You know  --  Davy is a very dear friend , but after all he is the heir to the British throne  --  it would n't do for him to realize my plane will do more than a thousand miles an hour . You can see that , ca n't you ? As it was , some spy cabled my old pal Bill Taft that I 'd been taking Davy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wonder if I have that code message with me ? It was cute . "  |p152While  she was fumbling in her purse for President Taft 's message the waiter brought our waffles . " Where do you keep your plane in San Francisco ? " I asked . The girl looked up from her purse . " You 'd just like to know , would n't you ? I remember now , I burned that message of course . I 'm supposed to burn all messages I get from Bill . It is n't on account of his wife  --  she 's not a bit jealous . Just a matter of international diplomacy . " " Of course , " said Rogers . " You eat your waffle before it gets cold . You 'll feel better after you get some food into you . " She drenched her waffle with syrup and took a bite . " No , " she said , " not food , but music . You should hear me play the piano . " " I 'm sure we 'd love to , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material . We need groceries now and then . " " Never had but one music lesson in my life , but I could play like Paderewski . " " Must have had a pretty good teacher , " I suggested . " Pretty good ! Listen , I 'll tell you about it . One Sunday afternoon I was alone in the living room and all at once I looked at the piano and wished my mother had made me take lessons when I was a kid . I had n't any more than wished that than who was standing beside me but St. Cecilia . " She was looking down at me with a kind smile andshe said to Inc , ' You wish to pay the piano , my child ? ' " I said , ' Yes , St. Cecilia , but I 'm afraid it 's too late now . ' " And site said , ' Not at all , my child . Come sit at the pianoand I will teach you . ' " So I went to the piano and St. Cecilia said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now what do you want to play ? ' " I said , ' Well , if you do n't mind , St. Cecilia , I 'd like to start with " Everybody 's Doin ' It . " '  | " ' Go ahead and play it , ' she said , so I started playing and Paderewski could n't have done better . " ' That 's all right , ' said St. Cecilia , but you need a little more pedal on the doin ' . You want to emphasize that . ' So I played it again and St. Cecilia said it was very good . Then I played Over the Waves ' and " The Mosquito Parade ' and everything . And sometimes I could play so fast the piano could n't deliver as fast as 1 was hitting the keys . I 'd get the keys stacked up way ahead and I could take my hands off and the piano would keep right on playing for live seconds or so until it could catch up with me . And pretty soon when I turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone . " The girl took a drink of coffee . " I 've been able to play like that ever since . You 'd think with anybody playing as fast as I do the keys would stick like typewriter keys , but they do n't . " " Oh , " said Rogers , " you were a stenographer before you got to be a snowbird , were n't you ? Who 'd you work for ? " The girl 's mouth opened and she turned and stared long at Rogers . Then she began to cry . " You 've insulted me , " she blubbered . " You know I 'm royalty . You know I 'm practically engaged to His Highness , the Prince of Wales . Yet you ask me if I 'm a stenographer . Well , that 's what one gets for being democratic . Let me out of here this instant . " She rose and tried to push by Rogers . " Wait a minute , wait a minute , " he commanded . " You quiet down and eat your waffle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up her cup and she threw hot coffee full into Rogers ' face . Rogers let out a bellow but before he could wipe the coffee from his eyes the girl had climbed right over his lap and out of the booth . I made a grab for her , but she slapped me in the face with her purse and fled from the restaurant.  | Rogers was n't really burnt by the coffee and our waiter came and sympathetically helped wipe the coffee from his face and coat . Then we went ahead and ate our waffles and sausage . " That , " Rogers said , " is what you get for fooling with a sleigh-rider . Coke-heads are funny , but you ca n't tell what they 'll do . They 'd slit your throat and think it was a joke . " Two weeks ago the Saturday Evening Post carried anotherstory by Irvin S. Cobb which I believe is the greatest short story I ever read . It was called " The Belled Buzzard " and tells simply of how a man 's own imagination convicted him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close attention to minute detail which makes the story remarkable . I have learned from Cobb that I am far from ready to begin writing seriously yet . Not only must I study means of expression , but I must study life more . When Cobb writes of anything you can be certain he knows even the smallest angle of his subject . So many writers have only a superficial knowledge of their subject and their work shows it . Before Cobb puts pen to paper he has gone over his locale with a fine-tooth comb . he has dissected every plant in the district , he has studied the life habits of every animal and bird in the vicinity . Ile knows the manners of speech of the people and their business and recreations . " Riders of the Purple Sage " by Zane Grey , a new book I have just read aloud to Pearl , is very popular now . It is a very fine book in some ways and Grey seems to know his subject almost as well as Cobb knows his . I find myself unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations seem more real to me than do Grey 's . And I have a feeling that Cobb 's work will live when Grey 's is forgotten . In this , however , I may be mistaken . Pearl much preferred " Riders of the Purple Sage " to " The Belled Buzzard " and said it seemed much more real to her than Cobb'sp155story . And I must remember that I have little taste for the classics . For instance , I remember I hated Thackeray 's " Henry Esmond " when we read it in high school . NOVEMBER 14 , 19t2 . It is cold and foggy and rainy tonight so we stayed iii . Mr. and Mrs. Castro came up and we played hearts . Mrs. Castro , who is quite vivacious despite her thinness , is teaching Pearl to play bridge whist and Pearl wants me to learn . But it seems a waste of time to me . I should rather read than play cards , but I get very little opportunity to read these days . Byron is 19 months old now and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front steps the other day and got a nasty bump on his head . He calls me " poppy " and he loves to climb on my lap and pull my hair . It is amazing how much that child means to me now . I catch myself talking too much about him at the office and I know what bores proud fathers can become . The fifth was election day and , of course , Woodrow Wilson was elected President by the greatest majority ever recorded . Taft carried only two states , Vermont and Utah , and got a total of 8 electoral votes . Roosevelt got 88 electoral votes and Wilson 435 . Now we shall see some legislation to help the common people , for Wilson has a Democratic Congress to back him up . I bet $10 against $7 on the election and won the $7 . But I lost $5 on California , which cut my winning to $2 . Hiram Johnson carried California for Roosevelt , but by the narrow margin of 174 votes . Election time is a terrible grind in a newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work at 11 o'clock Tuesday morning and worked straight through until 9 o'clock Wednesday . Then I went home , shaved , took a bathp156and slept an hour and a half before coming back to the office . My old bookkeeping training comes in very handy in compiling election returns . I was complimented on my job . I had another dream of Frances the other night . She was working in her kitchen and wearing a large red and blue apron . I could see a diamond ring and a plain gold band on her left ring finger as she started to wash the dishes in the sink . She had placed the dishes , apparently from breakfast , in an oval dishpan and took the teakettle off the stove . The water was steaming from the spout as she started to pour it in the dishpan . Then the top fell off the teakettle and steam rushed up over her right hand . She almost dropped the kettle , but managed to set it down quickly on the draining board . Her fingers were scalded from the steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smear it on her fingers . Then I saw her sit down , holding her right wrist with her left hand and heard her sobbing softly from the pain . I awoke almost crying myself in sympathy . It was 5:30 a.m. , which would have been 8:3o in Buffalo  --  about the time she would be washing breakfast dishes . The other day I read of an Austrian scientist named SigmundFreud who has written a book about the interpretationof dreams . I am going to get that book from the library , if possible , and see if he has any solution for my strange dreams of Frances . 1 wonder if there are any authenticated cases of people dreaming of occurrences while they actually are happening ? JANUARY 4 , 1913 . " I should worry " is the current slang rage . To every comment the smart slang reply is , " I should worry "  --  which means just the opposite ; i.e. , complete indifference . When I was walking to work this afternoon I saw a littlep157girl about 8 years old on California Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 should worry , I should care , I should marry a millionaire : If he should die , I should cryAnd I should marry another guy . " The newspaper humorists and cartoonists are having a lot of fun over this being a " jinx " year . And a good many superstitious people are willing to concur seriously . ' I'lhat goes particularly with the Republicans who can sec nothing but disaster in a Democratic administration . I have heard people point to the armament race in Europe ( people who should know better ) and quote how Germany is increasing her army and how France is increasing her army and Russia and the other countries and predict that the greatest war in history is in the offing . They refer to the Agadir , Morocco , incident of 1911 when Germany and her allies and France and her allies were snarling at each other . They say war was narrowly averted then and that next time it will be more difficult to avoid . Big-voiced Torn Rogers is one of the leading jingoes in the Tribune . Germany , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territorial expansion . He believes Kaiser Wilhelm is building up his military force for conquest . Great Britain , he says , is jealous of Germany 's growing foreign trade becauseGermany , being efficient , can manufacture goods and undersell England . He sees France as living in terror of Germany and preparing for a war which is considered inevitable . I point out to Rogers that wars were the natural thing in the Dark Ages because the people of every nation were ignorant of the neighboring peoples and that ignorance breeds distrust , fear and hatred . Now , however , the peoples of every land know the nature of their neighbors because they are able to read and because there are daily papers and magazineswhich show the Frenchman that the German is no different from himself , wishing only a chance to make a living and support his family . Why , then , should he wish to shoot Germans ? The Germans are proud of their scientists who are working to conquer disease and physical forces and make the world a better place in which to live . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are working largely together with the Germans . It is unthinkable , then , that mere business rivalries could cause a war . True , the nations of the world are building many big cannons and battleships , but those could act as well for preservation of peace as for waging war . Even if some ruler were mad enough to start a major war , it is certain that enlightened twentieth century citizens should refuse to fight and that the ruler would be overthrown . I was amused at a cartoon I saw the other day , entitled " The Calamity Chorus . " It depicted a group of farmers dancing woefully arm in arm and singing : " Frost 'll get the peach crop , peach crop , peach crop ; Frost 'll get the peach crop , ai n't that mean ? Frost 'll get the peach crop , for it 's nineteen thirteen . " That , I think , is just as sensible as Tom Rogers ' arguments about war . The government 's new venture into business also is causing a lot of comment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are a lot of jokes about the farmer shipping a dozen eggs by parcels post and the recipient getting some chickens , and there are cartoons of poor mail carriers loaded down with cookstoves and calves and sacks of potatoes and there are stories of tests made between parcels post and express companies wherein the express packagep159arrived far ahead . Express companies are crying it is unconstitutionalfor the government to go into competition with private industry . Nevertheless I believe in government ownership of the utilities and I believe parcels post can be made to work  --  if they give it time . At present you have to go to the post office to mail a parcels post package and you have to buy special parcels post stamps . I think they 'll have to straighten that out if they 're going to compete with the express companies . They 'll have to fix it so one can phone the post office and they 'll send out a wagon to pick up the parcel and they 'll have to fix it so you can use ordinary postage stamps instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mighty fine Christmas this year . Pearl got a little tree and trimmed it . Byron was delighted . I lc would toddle around and around , smiling all over his face and saying , " Tee , tee . " He tried desperately to eat the ornaments and we had to move them all out of his reach . We got him quite a lot of toys , but the thing he likes best is a ' Teddy bear . He calls it something that sounds like " Buzz . " What he means or where he gets it , we have no idea . JANUARY 25 , 1913 . I really am saving some money now . I am putting away an average of $5 a week in the savings bank and now have $149 . If I can continue that average , it will make $26o a year . And it would seem that I can count on getting advancement in position and salary . I expect to have $1,000 salted away two years from this summer . Then I can invest that in building and loan or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money is to have money working for you . I am carrying $3,000 worth of life insurance , which is n't so very much , but enough for emergencies . And I believe there are better ways of saving money than life insurance . My goal is twofold . First I want to assure Byron of a college education . And second I am building toward that dayp16o when I shall retire from the newspaper business and start writing for myself . Morning before last I had a dream of Frances which indicatesshe is going to have a baby . I saw her sewing in her parlor , and presently she held up the garment and it was a baby 's dress . Now that is very much like the moving pictures . That is always the means by which the young wife of the movies reveals she is to present her young husband with an heir . Thus it is possible my dream mind manufactured this motion picture out of whole cloth . But I do not believe it . There is talk that William J. Bryan may be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course that is an honorable post , but as Wilson owes his very nomination to Bryan , I believe the Great Commoner should be given an even bigger place . It seems to me that Bryan would make an ideal Secretary of State . Things are being cleared up in preparation for a government of the people by the people and for the people . Congress has just impeached and convicted U. S. District Judge Robert W. Archbald of Scranton , Pa . It is the first time a federal judge has been ousted in 50 years . Archbald was convicted of corrupt collusion with railroad and mine operators . President Wilson , as Governor of New Jersey , is waging violent warfare against the trusts , planning seven antitrust bills in the state . That bodes ill for the trusts when he enters the White I louse . And the Pujo committee investigating the Money Trust has the malefactors of great wealth on the run . As a matter of fact the Money Trust surrendered when George F. Baker , chairman of the First National Bank in New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about far enough . Baker , who is said to be next to J. P. Morgan in financial power , admitted that if this power " got into bad hands " it would wreck the country.  |p161He  did n't believe , however , that it would ever get into " bad hands . " Probably he considers " bad hands " are those who would do something to help the common people . Morgan , himself , said he was unaware that he possessed any unusual power . I is must not read the newspapers . We shall see great things happening in the next four years . FEBRUARY 13 , 1913 . Loth Pearl and Byron are under the weather with bad colds . So Pearl stayed in bed today on my day off and I have been doing the housework and cookingthe meals . I am learning to be a pretty fair cook . Medical science is moving in leaps and hounds to conquer the ills of the human race . Soon they will perfect a serum which will immunize people against colds and La Grippe such as Pearl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiped out by vaccination . Diphtheria , which used to kill thousands of children , has been robbed of its terrors by toxin antitoxin . And now two scourges of the ages are being whipped . From Biblical times epilepsy has been a terrible affliction that falls upon thousands . Heretofore medical science has regarded this terrible malady as incurable . Now , it is announced , Dr. Ralph H. Spangler of Chicago has discovered a treatment which has cured no patients . The treatment consists of injections of rattlesnake venom . Dr. Spangler has found that epileptic fits are caused by too quick coagulation or clotting of the blood . The rattlesnakepoison , diluted of course , lengthens the period of coagulation . The amazing discovery was made quite by accident . An epileptic in Texas was bitten by a rattlesnake and was cured of his fits . The second discovery is even more important because it appears to be a sure cure for tuberculosis , and millions more people are afflicted with the White Plague than with epilepsy.  |p162This  benefactor of humanity is Dr. Friedrich Friedmann of Berlin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying to obtain an effective type from every animal imaginable . Finally he tried the turtle and the turtle serum works . Dr. Friedmann has shown proof that his vaccine is entirely harmless and that he has treated 1,182 cases of tuberculosis in Germany , all of which were completely cured except those far advanced . He now is working on a method to immunize children against the disease and is coming to the United States to open a clinic in New York . Men like Dr. Spangler and Dr. Friedmann should be honoredfar above war lords such as Napoleon , General Grant and Bismarck . Scientists are the real heroes . My fondest hope is that Byron may become such a man as Dr. Friedmann or Dr. Spangler . MARCH 6 , 1913 . President Woodrow Wilson made one of the greatest speeches on record at his inauguration . He has won the whole nation , the whole world , as a matter of fact . Even Taft , at the close of the address , put out his hand and said , " Mr. President , we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressed with Wilson 's high ideals , declared the spirit of this address would spread over Europe , working for peace and good will among all nations . The President showed the good judgment to appoint Mr. Bryan Secretary of State , which will strengthen his administrationgreatly . There also is a new cabinet post , one which has long been needed in America  --  that of Secretary of Labor . It will have the effect of bringing justice to the laboring man and prevent wasteful and dangerous strikes . Wilson 's Secretary of Labor also is a good choice . He is William B. Wilson , who formerly was secretary of the Miners ' Union and who as congressman fathered the bill creating his post.  |p163APRIL  3 , 1913 . I put Pearl and Byron on the train this afternoon , bound for Kansas City . Pearl has been away from home two years and a half and Mrs. Hawkins never has seen her grandson . Naturally the trip is expensive . It takes practically all of our savings for the ticket and berth and for clothes for Pearl and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was no more than right that she should . ( ) f course now was the time , before it gets so hot in K.C. She plans to come back along the first of May . Well , the change will be good for her . There have been terrible floods in Ohio , Indiana and Texas . Dayton , Ohio , has been virtually destroyed with nearly a thousanddead in the Ohio Valley . Hundreds also have been drowned around Brazos , Texas . I hope the Missouri and Kaw rivers do n't go on a rampage . APRIL 10 , 1913 . Fran has had her baby and strangely enough it was born on little Byron 's second birthday  --  yesterdayunlessit was born early this morning . I dreamed of her being in a hospital bed this morning and beside her was the child . It is a girl , I know , because I heard her say to a nurse , " We 're going to name her Carol  --  Carol Clark . " Fran looked pretty pale and wan , but I guess she came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited about it all this morning as if it had been my own child . I have received a postcard from Pearl showing the CommerceTrust Company building and saying they arrived in K.C. all right and that her mother is crazy about Byron . While they are gone I have started writing a short story to sell to a magazine . Magazines pay good money for short stories and I may as well make some of it in my spare time . This is the story of a newspaper reporter in San Francisco who falls in love with a rich girl . The girl 's family oppose him as a suitor , but the girl loves him and they have many things in common , including convictions that the world could be run without war , poverty and crime if it were impossible for people to accumulate great wealth and if everyone was sure of an ample living . The girl has some money of her own and a yacht , so they make up a crew of several young men and girls whom they have convinced of the truth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There on an island they found a Utopia and are getting along fine despite a typhoon which wrecks the yacht and the menace of savage natives , whom they finally convert to their way of thinking . The millionaire father , however , has hired many detectives to trace his daughter and finally they discover " Paradise Island . " The father goes down there to get the girl and takes federal officers to arrest the reporter on charges of abduction and stealing the yacht . But after he gets there and looks over the peace and beauty of the island , he falls in love with the place himself , builds a grass hut and joins the colony . When I rewrite it I am going to send the story to the Saturday Evening Post , which pays handsomely for stories they like . " Paradise Island , " as I have titled it , should bed unusual enough to attract the Post 's attention . I should he tempted to send Fran 's baby a present if I knew her address . Also there is a possibility that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has no baby , perhaps she is n't even married . APRIL 14 , 1913 . Last night after work Tom Rogers , Jack Cullen and I went down around North Beach for a little recreation . First we went to an Italian place and had some Italian spaghetti and wine . Then we went to another Italian placep165and had some special kind of wine that Cullen wanted us to try . There was a rather pretty Italian girl there who served us with the wine and with bread sticks and a Cockney seaman who seemed to be paying court to the Italian girl . He was a wiry fellow of about medium height and very pleasant . Cullen , feeling his wine , invited this sailor to have a glass with us and he accepted . 11c was shipping on the morrow , he said , around the Horn for Liverpool . When he smiled , which was often , he showed that one of his front teeth had been broken off  --  probably in a fight . A pivot tooth had been put in , hut that also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a slender steel fang . He told us his name was Freddie Cutler and in a strong Cockney accent described his life at sea which , he attested , was a veritable h  --  . Scarcely a long voyage could he remember where there had not been at least one murder aboard the freighters on which he ships . And in his 15 years at sea he has lived through nearly a dozen mutinies . " The officers of a freighter , " Cutler said , " get their jobs because they are hard men and without conscience . They are always armed with revolvers and the men have little chance in case of a mutiny . More times than I 'd care to tell you gentlemen I 've seen shipmates bloody well murdered and thrown overboard because they suffered some injury that might cripple them for the rest of the voyage . " " But , " I asked , " how can they account for the missing men when the ship reaches a port ? " Cutler smiled . " Blimy , " he said , " they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pneumonia or inflammation of the bowels and was buried at sea  --  God rest his soul . " " Ca n't the men make a true report ? " " And be black-listed for life ? Or murdered themselves when they put to sea again ? And what admiralty court wouldp166believe a common seaman against an officer ? " He laughed bitterly . " I 'd think you 'd get away from the sea and find a job on a farm or something , " said Cullen . Cutler shook his head . " The sea , " he said , " is something like opium smoking . Once you get the habit you ca n't get away from it , even when you bloody well know it 's going to be the death of you . And what else could a sailor man do ? I could n't plow potatoes if I tried . You just have to keep on and on once you 're in it . " I never knew but one skipper to get his deserts and that was a bloody b named Plumb on the Marble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cabin boy , a jolly little nipper named Alf Bennett who spilled a bottle of brandy in the skipper 's cabin and this Plumb shot him dead in a rage . Well , poor little Alf was a great favorite with the crew and we mutinied proper . First I watches my chance off the Gold Coast and I slips behind this Captain Plumb and I bashes in his skull with a capstan bar . Killed him dead , I did . " " You killed him ? " asked Rogers . " Killed him dead . Then before the first mate and the second mate knew what was happening I had the skipper 's revolver and shot him dead . And a Yankee named Three-Finger Gotch grabbed the first mate 's revolver and shot the second mate dead . ' 1'lic third mate , he see what 's up so he joined with us . Then we pipes all hands aft , dumps the bodies over the side and holds an election . Some was in favor of turning pirates , because if we sailed the Marble Cross in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without doubt a bit of hanging to boot . So we vote to scuttle her and we turn her shorewards toward Dakar . We sight land , wait for night and then open her bottom . When we hit Dakar in the boats we tell of an explosion and of how the officers went down likep167heroes . That was one time when a skipper got his bloody deserts . " While he was talking Cutler seemed a little embarrassed and self-conscious . 1 le had taken a pair of dice from his pocket and shook them absent-mindcdly in his hand . As he finished his talc he rolled the dice on the tablecloth and they came up double one . Cullen picked them up . " Snake eyes , " he said . " Was n't there any investigation ? " Rogers asked .

Before we knew it there was a crap game on , which was joined by a navy sailor and a young civilian who were sitting at a table across the room and pretty soon by the Italian who ran the place . I lost $5.40 . Cullen lost $16 , which was all he had . Rogers dropped $g and the Italian had to visit his cash drawer several times . I do n't know how the navy sailor and his civilian friend came out , but I think they lost also . I think the Englishman , Cutler , won about all the money that was won . We shot craps there until 5:30 and then the Italian got us some coffee . Rogers says he thinks the Cockney sailor is entitled to be classed with Baron Munchausen as a liar . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At one time I was about $5 ahead of the game and that could n't have been if the dice were loaded .

I stood between the two streams , not knowingwhich ramp they would be on . I was looking for Pearl to be wearing her red suit and hat and to be carrying or leading Byron . But she was wearing a gray suit and hat she had bought in Kansas City and a man who had taken a fancy to Byron on the train was carrying him . Pearl looks very nice in her new clothes . The first thing Byron said when he saw Inc was , " Oh , Poppy , By got choo-choo . " I said , " Yes , you came on a choo-choo . " " No , " he said , " By got choo-choo .

Anti-Japanese sentiment has been growing in California for a long time and it has just reached a climax with passage of a law which prohibits ownership of land by aliens . It was signed by Governor Johnson . Japanese are even more efficient truck gardeners than the Portuguese . Because they are willing to work such long hours and because they invariably hire other Orientals to work in their truck gardens and orchards at wages that no American could subsist on , they have been making competition most difficult . There have been a number of demonstrations against the Japanese over the state . When the antialien land law was introduced in the legislature , it was aimed directly at the Japanese . Japan was incensedand the ambassador in Washington registered an official protest . With bitterness in California at a point where a serious international incident seemed almost inevitable , Secretary of State Bryan took a flying trip out here to pour oil on the troubled waters . To an extent he succeeded . While the bill was passed and signed into a law , Mr. Bryan has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that it is not aimed directly at Japanese nationals , but at all aliens .

Yesterday being Friday , the 13th of 1913 should have been the " jinx day " of all time . But nothing untoward occurred , except that I had a quarrel with Pearl . When I got up a little before 11 o'clock Pearl and Byron were n't in the house . I took it for granted they had gone to the store so I shaved and dressed . About noon when they had n't showed up , I got my own combination breakfast and lunch and ate it . Then I played a couple of phonograph records . Then I read some of " Stover at Yale , " by Owen Johnson , which is rather humorous , but pretty light . About 1:30 , shortly before I had to go to work , Pearl came home with Byron . I probably was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been . She said they had been riding the cable cars . Byron is crazy about riding the cross-town cable cars , getting quite excited about the way the gripman clangs his bell as the car races up and down the hills and he squeals with delight when they lurch around corners . I said , " Well , it seems pretty silly putting in all day riding up and down hills on grip cars . " " Yes , " said Pearl , " it 's just like you to begrudge your family a little entertainment . " " All right , " I said , " if that 's your idea of entertainment , go on out and spend all the grocery money riding the grip cars . I do n't care . I can get my own meals , I guess . But if you 've got to ride cable cars it would seem you could do it after I 've gone to work . I do n't get to see much of Byron anyhow . It would seem you could leave him home in the littlep171time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car riding enough after two o'clock . " " Yes , " said Pearl . " That 's just what I 'd expect of you . You think it 's a pretty fine life for us being cooped up in this dirty old apartment all day while you 're in there snoring . You think , I suppose , that 1 ought to put a gag on the baby so I wo n't have to he hushing him every minute with , Now keep quiet , dear , darling Papa needs his sleep . ' " " All right , all right , " I cut in . " I thought , " she went on , " that I was being kind , taking the baby out so he would n't disturb you . But I suppose it practically killed you having to get your own breakfast for once . " " Go grip-car riding every day . It 's all right with me. 1 can get my meals . I did it while you were in K.C. and 1 can do it now . " " If , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you worked days like a white man we could live like white folks , too .

" " Yeah , you 're making swell money . If you were making good money we would n't have to ride cable cars . If you were making good money we could have an automobile . And if you were working days we could go out on Sunday down the peninsula for outings and give this child the country air he needs . And furthermore if you think I 'm going to stay cooped up in this dump of an apartment like a white slave all day , you 're going to get left . And see how you like that .

We took a ferry over to Neptune Beach today and Byron had a great time paddling in the water . I went swimming and the water was delightful . Pearl , who does n't swim , played in the sand and ate frankfurter sandwiches and ice-cream cones . Byron 's stomach was upset on the way home . Over there we got weighed on a penny-in-the-slot machine . Pearl weighed 139 . I weighed 131 and Byron , as near as we could see , 31 , but he wriggled so much the scale hand would n't stand still . Last Thursday we saw a fine movie , " The Spoilers . " It is a story of Alaska and in it is the most terrific fist fight imaginable . I read that this fight really was not acting , but that the principals actually fought for all they were worth to make it convincing . They certainly succeeded . It takes place in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other around . The hero , William Farnum , is supposed to have broken several of his opponent 's ribs in the battle and I do n't wonder . It has been an uneventful summer so far as news is concerned . But they are giving me a week 's vacation with pay next week . Because we have little money I would be satisfied to stay home and rest and catch up on my reading , but Pearl wants to get away from the city so we are going over to Sausalito and spend several days in the hotel where Pearl can get away from cooking and dishwashing . I think it will be good for all of us to get away from the city awhile . JANUARY 1 , 1914 . I have been pretty lucky with both Christmas and New Year 's Day coming on Thursday  --  my day off . Pearl and I had planned to celebrate the passing of the jinx year with a show and a little wine at a restaurant at midnight , but Mrs. Castro turned suddenly very ill and we had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Castro has been looking very bad lately and she has a ghastly cough . I have felt that she looked as if she had consumption and sometimes have been reluctant to leave Byron with her . She , however , has told Pearl several times that her trouble was only bronchitis , which is serious enough but not contagious . So Pearl and I saw the old year out in the apartment . I went out and got a bottle of claret and a dozen hot tamales and we had a midnight lunch that reminded us of the old days before we were married and Pearl used to wait up for me with a lunch at her mother 's rooming house . JANUARY 14 , 1914 . Mrs. Blanche Castro died Tuesday morningafter a terrible hemorrhage and we went to her funeral today . She was a fine young woman and one of our very best friends in San Francisco . For two years and more she has been taking care of Byron when Pearl and I went out . Byron loved her like a second mother . We shall miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this climate , but Frank Castro loved San Francisco and she never would think she would be better off elsewhere . She must have had tuberculosis , but she tried to bring herself to health by sheer will power . It is too bad the scientists have been unable to find a real cure for this awful disease . It is too bad that the German Dr. Friedmann and his turtle serum turned out to be a fake . This is a very bad climate for lung trouble . Since I have been on the Tribune one reporter and one copyreader have died of consumption . APRIL 23 , 1914 . American marines occupied the city of Vera Cruz , Mexico , last Tuesday after warships shelled the forts . There was a regular battle through the streets with the marines using machine guns against Mexican snipers and killing many . It all happened for the afternoon papers and most of the excitement was over by the time we came out at night . The battle followed repeated insults to Americans and the Americanflag by cohorts of President Huerta . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am satisfied that President Wilson and Secretary of State Bryan never would have allowed such an episode if it were not necessary . But I will admit if Taft or Roosevelt were President now I should believe the attack on Vera Cruz were inspired by the vested interests who hold large investments in Mexico . I have just read Sigmund Freud 's " Interpretation of Dreams . " I imagine there is a good deal of truth in his observations on sex , but he certainly is an extremist . There definitely is no carnality connected with my dreams of Frances . Our associations were always on a plane above that and I never think of her in that connection . Then Freud lists dreams as " wish dreams " and " fear dreams . " And I can not place my strange visions of Frances in either category . For instance , there was the dream of her marriage . Certainly I did not wish her to be marrying Paul Clark . And I did not fear it either . As I am unable ever to associate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marrying anybody she wished . I do want her to be happy . Freud has nothing to say about vision dreams like mine , of a person dreaming events as they actually occur . If there arc no records of such phenomena , my experiences may be unique . Or , of course , there may be nothing to them at all . I am convinced in my own mind that Frances married Clark just as I visioned it , but as a matter of fact , I have no proof . She may he married to somebody else . She may still be single and working as a stenographer for the insurance company . But I do not believe it . For two months I have been having vivid dreams of her at least twice a week . She has not seemed in good health ever since her baby Carol was born a year ago . In February she was sick in bedp175for several weeks and when she got back to her housework she had much the same appearance as Mrs. Castro . I will give her husband credit where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized the symptoms or have taken a doctor 's advice . They moved early this month out west , probably to Colorado , although I can not be sure of the location . They have a cottage on the outskirts of a small town which I have seen quite plainly several times . It is painted gray and has green shutters . There is a wooden picket fence around the yard and several large cottonwoods in front . I ( 10 not know what Paul Clark is doing there for 1 never see him in my dreams . But I do see Fran and see her baby sitting in its high chair in the kitchen while she is about her housework . Frequently Fran will pause in her work and step to the kitchen window and push back the curtain to look out . There is a wonderful view of a mountain range from that window . Now it might well be that they have not moved west at all , but are living in the Alleghenies or the Adirondacks . But the mountains do not look like Eastern mountains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in Buffalo I often would waken after dreams about her at 4:30 to 6 o'clock . Now I never dream of her before 8:30 or 9 o'clock . I am positive in my own mind that Frances is thinking of me when I am dreaming of her . In Buffalo she probably would think of me after Clark had gone to work and while she was starting her housework . She would be too occupied and too much in a hurry while getting breakfast . Thus the change in time of my dreams indicates to me that she now is living in the Mountain Time section rather : ban in Eastern Time . That would place her either in Montana , Wyoming , Colorado , New Mexico , Arizona , eastern Utah , or Idaho.  | Inasmuch as the climate of Arizona , Montana , Idaho and Wyoming is rather harsh for invalids , they probably are living in Colorado or New Mexico and possibly Utah .

But of course the economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father in the real estate business in Buffalo . I do n't suppose he knows anything else . Necessarily , then , they would have to go someplace where he could go into business or where he could find a job . And , after all , the main thing for lung trouble is a dry climate and a reasonably high altitude . Wherever they are it is agreeing with Frances , I can see , for she looks much better than when they left Buffalo . I won $5.50 in a curious " win-place-show " office pool a week ago Monday . It was Jack Cullen 's idea . He got it up Sunday night on the electrocution of the four New York thugs who killed the gambler Herman Rosenthal a couple of years ago . Cullen made up twenty-four slips of paper each bearing the names of three of the four murderers in one , two , three order . He called it the " Hot Squat Parlay " and sold chances at 25 cents each . The slips were folded and shaken up in my derby . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2 ; and Gyp the Blood , 3 . I did n't like that ticket because there had been some intimation on the wire Sunday night that Governor Glynn of New York might give Dago Frank Cirofici a reprieve . It was rumored Cirofici was willing to give more information that might help convict Lieutenant Becker in his second trial . So I bought another ticket quickly and quietly . The second ticket read Gyp the Blood , I ; Lefty Louie , 2 ; Dago Frank , 3 . I had hoped to get a ticket that did n't list Dago Frank at all . This second ticket was no better thanp177the first if the governor granted a reprieve , but I decided I could n't afford to invest any more and let it go . But as it turned out , Glynn did n't grant any reprieve and my second ticket won . That is the order in which they went to the chair  --  Gyp the Blood , Lefty Louie , Dago Frank and last , Whitey Lewis . So 1 collected $6 which left me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis broke in Europe early last week that looked very serious for a few days . But it has been happily cleared up . The Archduke Francis Ferdinand of Austria and his wife were touring in Bosnia when , at the town of Sarajevo , a young anarchist named Gavrio Princip shot and killed them both . Of course Princip was arrested for the murder . But for the fact that a bomb had been thrown at the Archduke and his consort earlier in the day the incident probably would have been considered the act of a madman and would have been closed with his execution . However , there is a great deal back of this assassination . First , Austria-Hungary occupied Bosnia under the Berlin treaty of 1878 for the express purpose of " pacifying " the Bosnians . The country formally was annexed by AustriaHungaryin 1908 . The people of Bosnia are said to be largely Slavic and unfriendly to the Germanic rule . There are many Servians living there and the Vienna government charges Servia has been attempting to stir the Bosnians to revolt against AustriaHungary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throne of Austria-Hungary on the passing of Emperor Francis Joseph , was too ambitious for his own good . He had imperialistic dreams of a German-Magyar-Slavic kingdom that could control Europe . And his dangerous ambitions raised a hatred among the Bosnians that resulted in the Archduke 's death . The murdered Archduke 's successor , on the other hand , is 27-year-old Charles Francis who is said to be very able and not too ambitious . He is better liked in his own kingdom than was Francis Ferdinand . So , inasmuch as Servia has promised a thorough investigation into the possibility that the plot originated in Servia , the assassination may actually insure the peace of Europe rather than jeopardize it . For a few days it looked as if the Bosnian affair might embroil all Europe in warfare , for Russia with her army of millions has sworn to protect Slavic Servia from invasion by Austro-Hungarians . And Russia is bound by the Triple Ententetreaty with France and Great Britain , who , if they lived up to the treaty , would help out Russia . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Triple Alliance treaty . European leaders realize , however , that a general war would do no one good , but would cost millions of lives and billions of dollars . It is apparent now to thinking people that science has advanced so far that another great war is practically impossible . Growing out of the war talk last week came a statement from Admiral Sir Percy Scott of the Britsh navy , which shows the turn a war at sea would take . According to Sir Percy , the battleship is a thing of the past . British submarines could control the seas . At present Britain has 69 submarines and is building 35 more . Her ally , France , has 50 submarines and is building 31 more . Germany has only 24 submarines and is building 31 . " Realizing the power of British undersea boats , " Sir Percy said , " at the first signs of a foreign war the enemy would lock up its battleships and cruisers in some safe , protected harbor and never venture out into the high seas . Britainp179would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchant ships moving in or out of the enemy ports . The submarines thus could protect British commercewhile starving out the enemy . " Now that the war scare has been put down the papers are full of a proposed aeroplane flight across the Atlantic . Glenn H. Curtiss , an early aeronaut , has just built a large hydroaeroplane for Rodman Wanamaker . It has the hull of a boat so it could land in the ocean and is driven by two gasoline engines . It would be navigated by Lieutenant John Cyril Porte of the British navy and piloted by an American , George I Iallett . They propose to take off from Newfoundland , fly to the Azores Islands and thence to England . There is a good deal of enthusiasm over the project , but experts are doubtful . Even Lincoln Beachcy , who is probably the foremost aviator in America , says a flight across the Atlantic can not be done  --  at least not with Wanamaker 's aeroplane , America . Beachey does not believe the plane can get aloft with sufficient fuel to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is beyond the endurance of one pilot to fly an aeroplane from Newfoundland to the Azores . " Perhaps , " says Beachey , " one man could pilot a plane for fifteen hours or so over the ground . But he has the comforting sight of good Mother Earth beneath him . When there is nothing in sight except the dismal watery waste of the Atlantic it would have a shocking effect on the pilot ; it would increase his nervous strain many times . " I do n't believe it possible for one pilot to fly across the ocean . Porte may be a competent navigator , but he should have another pilot so they could spell one another every four or five hours . If they ever fly across the ocean they will have to build a plane that will fly like a streak . Wanamaker 's ship is too slow . "  |p180My  dreams of Frances have been continuing on the average of once or twice a week . Usually nothing is taking place . I just have a sudden picture of her at her work or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little gray cottage and pushing the baby buggy down and out the wooden gate and then down the street toward the businesss section where she does her shopping . The sidewalks are made of flagstones . They are rough and red and coarse grass and weeds grow up between the flags . Along the picket fence in the shadow of the big cottonwoods hollyhocks grow . And beyond the hollyhocks there is a tall sheaf of black-eyed susans and even half a dozen huge sunflowers . The street in front of the house is unpaved and rutty , but the soil is light and gravelly . It is quite dry there now and sun-baked and sometimes the wind swoops down from the mountains sending the dust in swirls toward Frances ' house . I witnessed a minor tragedy there the other morning . Frances must have risen early to wash , for she had the clothes hung out by 8 o'clock our time , which was probably 9 o'clock where she is . I could see the clothing fluttering in the breeze  --  the baby 's little dresses and underthings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frances ' own house dresses and teddies and stockings and towels and sheets and pillow cases . Then a sudden gust came howling down the canyon , rustling the silver-gray leaves of the cottonwoodsand making the sunflowers and hollyhocks bow down before its onslaught . It caught the clothes and whipped them violently for a moment . Then the rope clothesline snapped and the whole wash went slithering down into the dirty gravel of the back yard . Poor Fran , already tired from the washing , was sobbing to herself as she gathered up the dirt-streaked clothing in the washbasket and carried it in to do over . I should think Clark could at least put up a wire clothesline for her.  |p181JULY  16 , 1914 . There is a great deal of unemployment in San Francisco .

Now I 'll give you a dime if you promise me you 'll spend it for whisky instead of coffee . " The bum grinned sheepishly and promised . I believe most of these bums could get work if they really wanted it . For instance , they need men down in the apricot and prune districts of Santa Clara County and a self-respecting man would go down there even if he had to walk .

And practically every day he begs a penny or a nickel from Pearl for candy and she thinks it 's cute to see him toddle down to the corner grocery and come back with his face smeared with chocolate or licorice or red-hots .

The unthinkable , the unbelievable has happened . Virtually all of Europe is plunged into the greatest war in history . And it all was precipitated by an incident which we in America had well-nigh forgotten  --  the assassinationof Archduke Ferdinand of Austria . Austria had demanded that Servia conduct a thorough investigation of alleged plotting against Austria by Servians in Bosnia . This was agreed to by Servia . We thought that all was settled . But Austria also demanded that Austrian officers be permitted to take part in the investigation and Servia denied them that right . A week ago last Tuesday Austrian troops marched on Servia to force their point . They were fired on by Servian soldiers . The next day Russia began mobilizing more than a million men , declaring Austria was waging a war of conquest on her treaty ally . Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany ordered Russia to cease mobilization , threatening to declare war . Czar Nicholas ignored the command and Germany started general mobilization . France followed by calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed impossible to me , to almost all Americans . It seemed like a colossal game of bluff . It was announced in Berlin that Germany longs for peace , but the Russian mobilization is a threat that can not be ignored.  |p183In  St. Petersburg it was announced that Russia longs for peace , but the German threats were too serious to be ignored . In Paris it was announced that France longs for peace , but the German mobilization endangers the Republic . Last Saturday Germany declared war on Russia . French and German border patrols exchanged rifle shots . And Sunday Russian troops invaded Germany while Germans marched into France and Belgium . When Belgium appealed to her treaty ally , England declared war on Germany Tuesday . There was a naval battle in the Baltic Monday in which a German fleet drove Russian warships to cover . Last night the German army had penetrated Belgium as far as Liege where they apparently will be stopped , for the forts at Liege are said to be absolutely shellproof and impregnable . Military experts declare no army can get by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in history , but also the shortest . The resources of the world are not large enough to carry on this conflict more than a few weeks as it will cost hundreds of millions of dollars each day . Estimates of experts generally run from one month to three months . One man figures it could last a year before the world was bankrupt , but it is generally agreed that long before a year passes the soldiers would have to be fighting with stones and clubs because there would be no more ammunition and that the European governments would be overthrown by revolutions . As it is Germany is doomed to defeat , despite her present marvelous military machine . She is hemmed in and the British and French submarines will lay down a blockade , sinking any merchant vessels which attempt to bring food and supplies to the Central Powers . Italy has refused to join the war , declaring her treaty with Germany is simply for a defensive war . Tom Rogers and I are agreed that Italy is holding off for a while to see which way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germanyp184and Austria are being defeated , Italy probably will join the side of the Triple Entente . At present , while the combined armies of Germany and Austria number approximately 6,400,000 men , France , Englandand Russia have 10,600,000 . For the duration of this war I as telegraph editor shall have my hands full . I am going to work at noon and do n't get away until the Dawn Extra is put to bed at 3 o'clock in the morning . I have a huge map of Central Europe and colored tacks representing the various armies which I must keep in place . It is very exciting , but lots of work . I really need an assistant because there is so much happening and the wire services disagree so much that I have to get out a long summary of reports which we run in 1a-point on Page One , set two or three columns . I asked the Old Man to give me Tom Rogers as assistant , but he said it 'll probably be all over in a week or so . MARCH 15 , 1915 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours and too tired after work to keep up this record . The war has been going for seven months and a half and it is more terrible now than ever . I notice in my last entry that nobody thought the Germans could pass Liege . Well , they brought up new heavy artillery which blasted the Lirge forts flat . They captured Brussels . They nearly captured Paris , but were stopped by the French in a terrific battle on the Marne in which French reinforcementswere rushed to the front in taxicabs . There is a great deal of confusion about what is actually happening because both sides are lying at a mile-a-minute clip . But this much is certain : Germany and Austria are doing their fighting on Allied territory and thus far the innmenseresources of Britain , Russia and France have made no headway toward whipping the Kaiser . Britain 's vaunted submarine power has not been produced.  |p185Instead  , while the British navy certainly controls the sea and has driven German shipping off the ocean , German submarineshave sunk numerous British and French boats and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter we had a dramatic running story concerning the exploits of a German cruiser , Emden , which harried British shipping for weeks , sinking many merchantmen until she finally was destroyed by the Australian cruiser Sydney at Cocos Island in the South Pacific . The Germans have been pursuing a most ruthless warfare in France and Belgium with a cruelty almost impossible to believe under this modern so-called civilization . Apparently authentic reports sworn to by priests and other responsible people tell of Frenchwomen crucified on barn doors and we have had many eyewitness stories of German officers slashing off the hands of Belgian children with their sabers . These stories seem too authentic to doubt , but they are difficult for me to understand . Both my grandfathers were born in Germany as was my mother , although she was brought to America when a small child . Frances Harbach 's father was born in Germany and came to America when he was 16 to avoid military service .

The only explanation is the brutalizing effect of military life , the fact that these German soldiers have been driven insane with killing . I have developed a new respect for my grandparents ' good judgment in emigrating to the United States . Yesterday Lincoln Beachey , the foremost aviator in the United States , was killed when he fell into the Bay . He was putting on an exhibition for the Exposition and while straight/ening out after a spectacular dive the wings broke from his machine . Thousands saw him fall to his death . We took Byron to the Exposition late this afternoon and stayed until the lights were turned on the Tower of Jewels . It is a beautiful sight . Although the war halted foreign participation in the Exposition , it is more beautiful even than the Pan-American in Buffalo because of the wonderful setting . Byron was entranced with the Tower of Jewels  --  as were Pearl and myself . I took him on the merry-go-round and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperately , he wanted to ride again and I had to ride the thing three times . I finally got him off by bribing him with a promise of popcorn . That boy has a determination that will make him succeed in anything he undertakes . MAY 13 , 1915 . Last Friday came the most terrible occurrence of the war . A German submarine torpedoed and sank the British liner Lusitania near Ireland , killing 1,195 men , women and children , of whom 124 were Americans . The German embassy had warned Americans to keep off the ship with advertisements and placards before the Lusitania sailed from New York . But that can not excuse the ruthless warfare the U-boats arc conducting . There is a great deal of agitation now for the United States to enter the war on the side of the Allies , but it certainly will not be necessary to go that far . England has been sinning against America also in stopping American ships , forcing them to steam into British ports to be searched for alleged contraband bound for Germany . We went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am glad that wise , levelheaded Woodrow Wilson is President and that William Jennings Bryan is Secretary of State . Theodore Roosevelt is shouting from the housetops for America to teach Kaiser Wilhelm a lesson and wants top187recruit a brigade of cavalry which he would lead against the Germans . if he were President we should have declared war within twenty-four hours after the Lusitania sank . While Wilson is telling Germany where to get off , I feel he will lead America safely through this crisis . Terrible as the Lusitania sinking is , there is another side to the case . After all , the Germans claim the Lusitania was loaded with shells and cartridges which would have killed thousands of German boys had not the submarine fired the torpedo . There is talk also that the ship carried cannons capable of sinking a submarine . In that case , had the submarine come to the surface and hailed the Lusitania , shellfire would have sunk the U-boat and the British liner would have gone blithely on her way with her cargo of shells . And after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an American ship if they had to go to Europe ? And if they were traveling for pleasure , they had no business imperiling their nation 's peace by going to Europe at all at this time . Why do n't they come out here and see the Exposition ? Tonight we all went to the best motion picture ever . It is " The Clansman , " which is being shown back east under the title of " The Birth of a Nation . " It is based on the reconstructionperiod in the South following the Civil War . It reveals the terrible experiences of the Southerners after the slaves were freed and , encouraged by the carpetbaggers , began to take control of the country . Henry Walthall as Ben Cameron , the " little Colonel , " did a wonderful piece of acting as did two new actresses named Lillian Gish and Mae Marsh . The scene where the Ku-Klux Klan assembles and rides with flaming torches to battle is one of the most thrilling I have ever seen . We were in the balcony ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flickering is not so pronounced at that distance ) and when this scene came on an old manp188downstairs leaped up in his seat , waved his hat and let out a blood-curdling yell . No doubt he was a Southerner himself and probably had taken part in just such an event in his youth . There was another scene which reminded me forcibly of my own brief experience with the movies . Several negroes attackeda very muscular blacksmith , played by an actor named Wallace Reid , and the blacksmith picked up one of his assailants , swung him high over his head and hurled him through a glass window . At least I was spared the experience of crashing through glass . They had a large orchestra that played throughout the picture and the music was arranged to match the action . JUNE 10 , 1915 . Honest , fearless William Jennings Bryan has resigned as Secretary of State and has been succeeded by Robert Lansing . Bryan believes first in keeping this nation out of the war . He believed the notes the United States has been sending Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And rather than affix his signature to them he has resigned his post . Sentiment is growing for the entry of the United States into the conflict . I suspect much of this sentiment has been manufacturedby the Wall Street bankers who have been lending hundreds of millions to the Allies and want to protect their investments . At the war 's outset Bryan vigorously opposed allowing these loans to be made . Permission for them was made over his protests . Many of the papers are lampooning the Commoner viciously for " deserting the ship " and because he refused to serve intoxicants at state dinners . I admire him even more because of his fearless adherence to his principles . I have been altogether too busy for the last year to think of putting down thoughts here for future use in my writings.  |p189I  am even too tired at the end of my 12- to 15-hour grind to think of reading . I do n't believe I have read anything except the newspapers since the war started last August . But I still dream of Frances . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It started on a warm afternoon when Frances came out on her front porch with little Carol . Fran was wearing a house dress of blue print and Carol , with her hair the color of a sunflower 's petals , wore a little frock of the same material as her mother 's . Fran sat down in a weather-beaten rocker on the porch with a basket of stockings to darn and Carol , who was only two last April , was romping in the yard with her little fox terrier . The cottonwoods were rustling softly in the spring breeze and there were bright-colored tulips blooming along the side of the house . Fran , now looking the picture of health , darned her stockings and smiled at the little girl and the little dog chasing each other around the gravel and sparse grass of the lawn . There is a wooden picket fence in front of the yard , but the gate is broken and will not shut . Through this gate a huge mongrel suddenly dashed and set upon the little fox terrier . The terrier yelped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him down . Little Carol screamed , " Go away , bad dog ! " Frances dropped her workbasket and called to the baby , " Carol , come here quick ! " But the child apparently did not hear her mother in the chorus of growls and yelps and she ran toward the dogs to rescue her pct . She kicked the mongrel in the head with her tiny foot and the big dog turned on her . In a flash his teeth were sunk into her baby throat and he was shaking her like a limp rag . Frances was running down the walk to fight the brute with her bare hands when a heavy rifle cracked from ap190window across the street and the mongrel dropped the baby and bit at his own hindquarters . The rifle cracked again and he fell twitching in the gravel beside the inert little girl . Fran picked up the child and the blood was streaming from her mangled throat . The neighbor came running from his house carrying his Winchester . " Is she  --  is she  --  " he called . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow hair , now smeared with red . " Oh , please get a doctor ! " Frances sobbed . The man turned and sprinted down the street still carrying his gun while Frances hurried into the house and neighbor women came running to help and children gathered to gaze at and to toe the brindle body of the dead mongrel in the yard . That was one dream . And the next night or morning I saw little Carol die . It is all too real . I had a terrible battle to keep my own grief from growing hysterical . Pearl noticed my pallor and jumpiness and made me take some epsom salts . Albertson at the office noticed it and thought perhaps I was on the point of a nervous breakdown from working too hard on the war . So he got Mr. Rothstein to approve making Marvin Blue , a young copyreader , my assistant . Marvin is a nice boy and willing and he 'll be a lot of help as soon as I get him broken in properly . I am having him come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been far to much work for one man for the last year and a half . Not many men could have stood the strain of 12 to 15 hours work a day the way I have been doing . My health is a great asset to me . But I ca n't get over these dreams of little Carol . I scarcely could have been more upset were it my own child . I wonder how Freud would interpret these dreams of mine Certainly there could be no sex connection to this last series . I suppose if I told anybody of these dreams I have of Frances they would think me nuts  --  especially the fact that I can'tp191but take them seriously . As far as actual evidence is concerned I do n't know that Frances ever had a child , let alone a twoyear-oldnamed Carol . Yet Carol has been as real to me as any baby I ever saw  --  even Byron . As far as actual evidence is concerned , I do n't know that Frances is n't still living in Buffalo . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clark . Usually I dream of her in the morning while she might be doing her routine housework and might be thinking of me . Thus it could well be telepathy which causes the dreams or visions . But the dream of the dog attacking Carol came soon after I had gone to sleep . Its vividness woke me and I could sleep no more . I have thought over this a good deal and my only explanationis this : The thing occurred , apparently , in the early afternoon . At that time I was very busy on the telegraph desk and my brain necessarily was not receptive to telepathic impulses . But could not my subconscious have received the message and filed it away to be brought forth as a dream when I fell asleep and my subconscious finally gained ascendency ? OCTOBER 14 , 1915 . Still the war continues , growing more terribleweek by week . A fleet of Zeppelins flew over London last night , dropping bombs that killed 41 men , women and children and causing millions in damage . Millions of young men have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using poison gas for attack . We are lucky in having a calm and wise President who can not be swept off his feet by the interests who would have us enter the war to save the Allies from the " Hun . " The J.P . Morgan interests have just signed a half billion dollar loan to Great Britain and France . Little Byron is sick again with a cold on his chest and has been in bed for a week . I wish Pearl could make him take cod-liver oil.  |p192JANUARY  13 , 1916 . Byron has been sick a great deal this winter and now is in bed with another heavy cold on his chest . There has been so much fog this winter and Pearl feels the San Francisco climate is entirely to blame for the child 's condition . She also has a notion that the boy may have contractedconsumption from Mrs. Castro when we used to leave him with her on my night off . We have had several doctors and while none has said definitelythat Byron has tuberculosis , they do say he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels that doctors are reluctant to come right out and tell parents their child has consumption and when a Dr. Banks said it would be a good thing if we could move him to a sunnier , drier climate for the winter , she became almost frantic . I am reluctant to leave San Francisco , for I feel I have a real opportunity here on the Tribune . Sam Rothstein , the managing editor , has let it be known that he expects to move to New York City in the spring . That , undoubtedly , would place Jimmy Albertson as managing editor and leave the news editor post open . And I feel Albertson almost certainly would make me news editor . Albertson always has been most kind to me and has a high regard for my work . And the record I have made in handling the war news should offset any advantage in senioritythat Pete Van Camp , the city editor , and Hugh Murphy , head ( if the copy desk , might hold . I am now drawing $42.50 a week , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news editor job pays at least $6o . If I had that salary , I really could save some money . My bank account now amounts to $280 . But the health of a man 's family comes before his business opportunities . If Byron would be better in a drier climate I naturally am willing to make any sacrifice  --  if I can get a job . Consequently I have written letters to four newspapers in Denver , to three in Salt Lake City , two in El Paso , Texas ,  |p193and  two in Oklahoma City , outlining my qualifications and the reasons for wanting to leave San Francisco . These all being smaller papers in smaller cities , I can not hope to get a salary anywhere near as good as the Tribune pays me , but I do believe I should find a job . Telegraph editors , competenttelegraph editors , are most important in these days of the European War . JANUARY 27 , 1916 . I gave Sam Rothstein two weeks ' notice last Saturday , terminating more than five years on the San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denver Call , a morning newspaper . The managing editor , Fred Cotchell , wrote me I could have a job on the copy desk rim at $3o a week and , while he gave no definite promise , indicated I should be put on the telegraph desk soon if my work was satisfactory . Rothstein and Albertson both were very kind and told me if it were a matter of salary they could give me a raise to stay . And when I told them the reason for making the change they both assured me I could have a job on the Tribune any time I felt I could come back . That made me feel much more secure . One never knows what situation he will run into when he changes jobs . It may be that the Danver job will be impossible . I could be fired before I got my feet on the ground should I make some minor error . That possibility is always confronting any new man on any newspaper . For that reason I shall leave Pearl and Byron here for a week or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a furnished apartment . Pearl was n't enthusiastic about being left here even a fortnight , but she finally has seen the wisdom of it.  |p195FEBRUARY  II , 1916 . I arrived in Denver Wednesday afternoon and went to work that night on the Denver Cull copy desk . The editorial room is not nearly as good as the San Francisco Tribune , but the men on the copy desk at least are friendly and helpful . It is not a difficult desk on the rim , but the slat man , George Empey , a fat , nervous fellow about 3o , is also telegraph editor and has his hands more than full . I worked Wednesday and Thursday nights and Empey gave me tonight off . I do n't believe I shall have any trouble making good as a copyreader . But advancement is another thing . The combined telegraph and slot of copy desk job does n't look very good to me . On the way from San Francisco I had the strangest experienceof my life . And I still ca n't decide whether I did right or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to work as soon as I reached Denver and did n't want to be tired out from the trip , I took a Pullman for the first time . Pearl and Byron , who is feeling much better , took the ferry with me across the Bay for the ride and saw me on the train in Oakland . On top of the Sierras at Truckee there was a great deal of snow  --  more snow , in fact , than I ever saw before . Because of the snowsheds along the way I did n't realize how much there was until we stopped at the town and could see driftsp196Filed up almost to the eaves of some cottages . And from there clear across Nevada we crawled through a blizzard . The train was an hour late the next morning . At about so o'clock we came to a stop at a small town in Utah . I was in the smoking compartment reading a magazine and smokingmy pipe when the porter stuck his head in and said the snow had blocked the track ahead and it would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the window at the station and the sign under its eaves which read , " Raleigh , Altitude 6,12o feet . " The storm was over and several men stood on the platform kicking their feet together . You could see from their actions and their steamy breaths that it was very cold . From the window I had a view of the town water tower and a church steeple and part of the business district and it all looked strangely familiar to me . " Raleigh , " I said to myself . " When have I ever been in Raleigh , Utah , before ? " And I knew I never had been . Then I thought that perhaps the train had stopped there quite a while five years before when 1 was on my way to San Franciscofrom Kansas City . Then I thought that perhaps the town only reminded me of some other place . So many little Western villages look alike . But I really knew I was kidding myself all the time . I had a thought which was too crazy to consider . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I put on my overcoat and hat and went out on the station platform . I had forgotten it could get that cold . My blood was thin from five years in California and my overcoat was scarcely heavier than a mackintosh . But I walked briskly through the snow up and down the platform a couple of times and then stepped up to a fellow who had a red muffler tied around his neck . I asked him if he knew how long the train was going to be held there . He shook his head . " No telling , " he said . " There 's a cutp197over east of here what 's clear full of snow . Plow 's on the way but it may take ' cm hours to clean out the cut . Doubt if you get out of here before four o'clock this afternoon . " So I talked to this man for a while about the weather and railroading and the war and about Henry Ford 's peace ship and him failing to " get the boys out of the trenches by Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good car , " and laughed at his pun . Then he took a chew of tobacco and observed that whenever a man makes a pot of money in the real estate business or pawnbrokering or manufacturing corsets he immediately puts himself up as an expert on everything in the world . Then I asked him as casually as I could , " Do you know a man named Paul Clark here in Raleigh ? " He squinted his blue eyes and spat a brown stain in the snow . " Paul Clark ? " he said . " Oh , sure . Sure I do . He 's a foreman over at the smelter . " I felt oddly hot and suffocating despite the weather . " Do you know his wife ? " I asked . He shook his head . " No , " he said . " I know he 's got a wife , but that 's all . They live down at the end of Pine Street  --  last house on the right-hand side going out . Ai n't far from here . Pine Street 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over there that ends at the railroad track . " My head was buzzing and I felt faint and dizzy . But I tried to appear casual as I asked , " Is it a little gray frame house with some cottonwood trees in the front yard ? " " Yes , " he said , " yes , that 's the place . " And I said , " Wooden picket fence in front ? " He nodded his head . " You know the place . Clark wo n't be home this time of day , though . You know his missus ? " " Yes , " I said , " I know them both . " " Well , " he remarked , " you got plenty of time to go down and call on her before this train 'll be ready to go . " Then he left me and went into the freight house of the station . I do n't think this fellow noticed it , but cold as it was , the sweat was running down my face . Here I was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile from Frances . Everything checked . This must be the western town I had seen so often in my dreams . The description of the house fitted . Paul Clark  --  of course that was a fairly common name  --  but my intuition told me that Mrs. Paul Clark of Raleigh , Utah , was , beyond the faintest shadow of a doubt , my Frances . I walked down to the east end of the station platform  --  toward Pine Street . I was going down to see Fran after all these years , after all these sad years . But when I got to the east end of the platform I turned and walked back . I found that I was afraid to see Fran . I was afraid of what might happen . If it were truly Fran , it could not be doubted that her thoughts of me had inspired my dreams . In that case she surely still loved me . And if she still loved me , could we continue living apart after we met again ? Then what of my responsibilities ? Pearl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my poor semi-invalid baby son ? Could I desert him even for love ? True , I knew I wanted Frances more than anything this side of hell . I knew I actuallyneeded her and I felt she needed me . But I was responsiblefor Byron . Ile also needed a father . And it was my job to be a good father to him . But when I reached the west end of the station platform I said to myself , " God meant that Fran and I should be man and wife . That was plain from the first day we looked into each other 's eyes in high school . If Pearl is unable to take care of Byron properly she can give him up to me . " And I thought of the many differences Pearl and I have had . I thought of how little we have in common . I thought that I never really have loved her , that I was her husband onlyp199because it was convenient to her that I be her husband . I thought of all the dreams of Frances and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreams or visions . Now God has shown me the way . I will go . " I turned and walked fast eastward along the length of the station platform with the steam from my hot breath billowingup before me . But when I got to the east end of the platformmy steps began to drag and I turned and walked west again . . A. hundred times I walked back and forth along that platform . A hundred times I decided I would go down to Pine Street and a hundred times I changed my mind . My ears were stinging from the subzero temperature , but my light overcoat seemed oppressively warm . About noon I went back into the train feeling I had won a victory . I ate a small lunch in the dining car and smoked a cigar . I went back to my seat and settled myself with the magazine story to pass away the hours . I congratulated myself on my will power . But the first thing I knew I had my overcoaton again and was pacing back and forth on the station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the train , watching me through the frosty windows must have thought me crazy . And in fact I was crazy . Shortly after 2 o'clock the battle had worn me to a point of reckless exhaustion . My sense of responsibility was drugged . Everything in me was worn out and dying except my love for Fran , my desire for Fran . At the east end of the platform I kept on walking . I went plowing desperately through the hard fine snow toward Pine Street , toward the girl whom I had not seen in ten years , but whom I never would cease loving in a century . I was going to see Fran and to hell with consequences . The very least I could do was to see her when I was in the same town . I had gone nearly to Hemlock Street when the locomotive blew its whistle . And before I knew what I was doing I wasp200running back through the snow and climbing aboard the train . And then I was sitting in my seat , scratching the frost off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water tank and the church steeple and the bare cottonwoodtrees around a small house up a street I judged to be Pine and at a trickle of blue smoke rising from this small house 's chimney which might be coming from a fire that was warming my golden-haired Frances . And as the train whirled on through the snow toward Wyoming I asked myself why I came back . And I did n't know the answer . To satisfy my own mind , I should have gone and seen if the Mrs. Paul Clark of Raleigh really is my Frances . I know she is . But again , I do n't know . The whole thing is so fantastic . It has been so for years . I could have settled the matter of my strange dreams if I had only acted . But I did n't act . Could I have but seen Frances and talked with her awhile things would be so much better now . We would n't have run away together . Frances , knowing my responsibility , would n't have permitted it even though I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps , if I stay on the Denver Call , I shall get a vacation next summer or in 1917 . I never have had a vacation by myself . Perhaps if things go right I can convince Pearl I need to go fishing or something into the hills . And Raleigh , Utah , is not impossibly far from Denver . I could drop in there casually and discover by accident she is living there . That coincidence would not be greater than many of the actual coincidences of life . FEBRUARY i8 , 1916 . My job on the Call is apparently secure , so I have rented a furnished flat on East Nineteenth Avenue of the type they call a " terrace " in Denver and have sent word to Pearl to come on with Byron . There are numerous terraces here  --  low , flat-topped apart/ments that in reality are a series of square , brick cottages all joined . While they are practically flush with the street there still is a community hack yard where the children may play . In that they are much better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we occupied in San Francisco . Denver is not a large city -- only slightly above 200,000 , or approximately the same size as Oakland - but there is a quality to it I like already . There are no very large buildings , except that the Daniels and Fisher department store has a slim tower which is 20 stories or so high , and the gold-domed capitol building sitting on the only eminence in the city  --  a slight rise called Capitol Hill  --  appears huge from a distance . The Rocky Mountains , which rise sharply to the west , dominateDenver . In the clear air , this snowy range seems to be only a couple of miles away , but today , being my day off , I took a trolley car to the village of Golden and was surprised to discover that the nearest foothills are 13 miles from the city . Golden nestles between huge , flat-topped hills called buttes . One of these , Castle Rock ( which really resembles a castle ) has a funicular railway running up its 45  --  slope to the summit , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surroundingcountry . There are two tracks and a car on each track connected by a steel cable . I understand there are water tanks in the cars which are filled at the top and emptied at the bottom of the butte . Thus the weight of the water takes one car down the incline and pulls the drained one back up by the cable . The railway operates only in the summer when there is tourist business . There must be a magnificent view from the top of CastleRock and I must take Pearl and Byron up next summer . From an awesome , steep-walled canyon Clear Creek boilsdown from the mountains and through Golden . The water isp202no longer clear , but milky from the mine dumps far up the gorge . A queer little narrow-gauge railroad runs up the canyon clear up into the high mountains to a mining camp called Silver Plume and stopping at the other mining camps of Idaho Springs and Georgetown . I walked a short way up the canyon and presently a whistle shrilled , echoing weirdly among the sheer rock cliffs . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the past . The tiny locomotive had a tall , swelling smokestack such as those in pictures of Civil War times . I understand there are a number of such railroads running into the mountains and that in the summer they have onedayexcursions at ridiculously low fares . We 'll have to , take some of those on my days off . The newspaper gang in Denver is the most friendly I have seen anywhere . There is bitter rivalry between the papers , but away from work the reporters and copyreaders are good friends . There is a press club where the fellows meet after work to play pool or poker and drink and gossip and banter about who got scooped and why . Last Saturday night after work I went to the press club with John Soibclman , who sits next to me on the copy desk . We found a dozen or so there from the Call and the Rocky Mountain News and the Denver Post . The steward , a dour Chinaman named Jim Wong , was grumbling about the work and serving sandwiches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in orders . Li the main room of the club are a billiard table , a pool table and player piano and rack of rolls and some bookcases of oddly assorted books . In the room adjoining to the back there is just one large green-topped round table with a greenshadedlight and chairs . The other room is the bar with Jim Wong 's gas range and refrigerator back of it , a couple of pinep203tables and chairs and one of the Dewey gambling machines such as they had on the gambling boat in Kansas City . When John Soibelman admitted us with his passkey a poker game already was in progress . Soibelman introduced me to the players and they invited us to buy a stack of chips . It seems the club sells $4.50 worth of chips for $5 which is one of its means of raising revenue . At the table already were Harvey Thorpe , slim and saturninereporter for the Call ; Roscoe McNamara , florid and a little pompous , who is state editor for the Rocky Mountain News ; Bill Cunningham , city editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wears a worried expression and an odd , round black felt hat on the back of his head ; and Charley Murray , a bright-looking young Irishman with a caustic tongue who is a reporter for the Times . Thorpe , I discovered , had put in several years as a clown with John Robinson 's circus and McNamara had been a circus advance man . So between deals Thorpe and McNamara were putting on , with all seriousness , an act which they loved . McNamara , unsmilingly , was a small-town mayor . Thorpe was a circus claim agent , or whatever they call it . And McNamara was trying to collect damages . " Now , your Honor , " protested Thorpe , " surely you know that the great Adam Forepaugh circus wishes to be fair with everyone . " " I know , I know , " McNamara drawled with heavy sarcasm . " Nothin ' but fairness about a circus . Come into a town , stay a day and take out thousands of dollars what ought to go to the merchants . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the merchants ' tills on circus day and you 'll find they do bigger business than any other day in the year . But I need n't tell you this , your Honor . You know as well as I. And it 's all beside the question . Where now was this damage done ? "  | " Right at the corner of Main and Clay streets , " attested McNamara with some heat . " But you ca n't be certain it was done by the circus , can you , Mr. Mayor ? " " Ca n't be certain ? Why , gol darn it , Fred Hackett was right there and he seen it and Miss Mamie Pinkham , she plays the organ in the South Methodist Church , why , she was right there and she seen it and  --  " " Oh , can the comedy , Sureshot , " Murray interrupted . " Are you playing or not ? " Thorpe looked at his hole card . " I stay , " he said , throwing in a red chip . " Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had a deuce and a five of diamonds showing . " On what ? " asked Cunningham , irritably . " Possible straight flush , " said Murray . " Raise you another blue one , " said McNamara . " They all seen it . I got half a dozen witnesses , I have , that your dadgummedold parade wagon with the hippypotamus painted on the side turned the corner too brash and run right over the curbing at Main and Clay and smashed off a great chunk of the stone . " " I stay , " said Cunningham . " I stay , " said Thorpe . " I 'll see your blue one and raise you another , " announced Murray . " I stay , " said McNamara , "  --  a great unsightly scar on the face of our beautiful town and all because of criminal recklessnesson the part of a money-grabbing circus that comes in and  --  " Cunningham scowled . " Not afraid of you , Murray . But I fold my tent like the well-known Arab . " Thorpe threw in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If , " he said , " any damage whatsoever has been done by the Adam Forepaugh circus , the Adam Forepaughp205circus , greatest show on earth , is ready and willing to make any reasonable restitution . Well , " as he dealt an ace to himself , " up jumped the devil . No pairs in sight and the ace bets a blue one . What do you consider , Mr. Mayor , to be a fair price for repairing the allegedly damaged curbing ? " " You bet , " said Murray , testily , " right in the face of my possible straight flush ? Well , I raise you a blue one . " Murray now had the three , five and six of diamonds in sight . " I 'll see the raise , " said McNamara , sadly . " We estimate the damage at three hundred dollars . " " But , Mr. Mayor , Mr. Mayor , that 's ridiculous , unheard of , positively preposterous . " Thorpe threw iu another blue chip . " I 'll just call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of concrete chipped off a curbing by a parade wagon that was giving thrills and pleasure to your own townspeople and your own kiddies ? You ca n't be serious . " " Oh , deal the cards , " snapped Murray . Thorpe dealt Murray a very black jack of clubs , a four of diamonds to McNamara that would have made Murray 's hand look very dangerous and then the three of diamonds to himself , which showed Murray had n't even a chance for a straight from the beginning . " Ace bets a blue , " observed Thorpe . " It ai n't just the actual value of the curbing , " said McNamara , " though it 'll cost plenty to put in that whole corner . It 's that unsightly scar on the face of the town , hurtingour reputation when visitors come in and  --  " " I call , " said Murray . " You ca n't be serious , your Honor , " said Thorpe . " How could a small piece of chipped curbing damage a town 's reputation ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and Main and Clay is right on the direct road from the Katy station to the Austin House . When visitors are coming in on the station bus , how can theyp206help seeing that unsightly scar ? How can they help , gol darn it , saying My , what a slovenly town Wilsonville must be : " " You 're called , Thorpe , " said Murray . " What 's your hole card ? " " Another ace . " Thorpe flipped over the ace of spades . " Just tops my ladies . " McNamara turned over a queen which matched his third card . " Come to your drunken father , " drawled Thorpe , raking in the chips . Jim Wong brought Soibelman and me stacks of chips and we sat in the game . On and on the dialogue between the mayor and the circus agent continued . The town must protectitself . Suppose some citizen tripped on the broken curbingand was injured . Suppose he or she won $io , 000 judgment against the town before the curb should be repaired . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in accepting $300 . Murray continued raising the bet at every turn . Sometimes he won . More often he only built up a substantial pot for someone else . Both Soibelman and I were lucky . Cunningham seemed to be playing a conservative and sensible game . But luck was against him . Thorpe and McNamara were more interested in their debate than in the cards . About 2 o'clock a lanky and rather drunken fellow of around 35 let himself in with a passkey . He was introduced to me as Judd Watson , political reporter for the News . For a minute or so he stood grinning at the Thorpe-McNamara act . " At it again , " he said , mildly . Then he went to the bar and drank a couple of straight whiskies . Then he went to the player piano and began to pump out " A Perfect Day " very fast and as loud as he could make it . When that roll was ended he played the " Sextette from Lucia " equally fast and equally loud . Then he played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Sextette from Lucia . "  | " For G  --  ' s sake , " called Murray , " do n't pump that thing so hard , Judd . " " I like it loud , " said Judd , smiling happily . " Sounds prettier when it 's loud . " Then lie played " A Perfect Day . " Then he played the " Sextette from Lucia . " Then there was a vigorous rapping on the door and Jim Wong opened it before two very large policeman . They pushed into the room . " Hello , fellows , " hailed Judd , waving his hand . " Come in and sit down . I 'll play you some music and buy you a drink . He began to pump once more on " A Perfect Day . " The policeman walked over by the piano . " Listen , Watson , " said the bigger one , " you 're making too much noise for three o'clock Sunday morning . We got a complaint . You got to stop that . " Judd stopped pumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He turned and squinted owlishly at the officers . " Now , " he said , " who would complain about a little music ? I love music . Do n't you cops love music ? " " Sure , " said the smaller policeman , " I like music , but that ai n't the question . The girls next door is complaining . They say they ca n't sleep for the noise over here . " Judd got up from the bench and put his arms around the policemen 's shoulders . " Now , fellows , listen , " he said . " No girls ought to be sleeping this time of Sunday morning , anyhow . You 're not sleeping . I 'm not sleeping . Jim Wong 's not sleeping . Nobody ought to be sleeping . " He led them to the bar . " Now you fellows have a nice drink with me and then I 'll tell you what to do . You go over and have the girls come up here and I 'll play them some music . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " We 'll have a drink , " said the bigger policeman . " But we ca n't do that . The girls complained to the captain . You got to quit pumping that piano , Judd . " Jim Wong put a bottle and glasses on the bar and they allp208drank . The smaller policeman put a nickel in the Dewey slot machine and pulled the handle . He did n't get anything . " Fellows , " said Judd , " you make me sad . I love music . I do n't get much chance for music and now you say I ca n't play . I ca n't understand folks that do n't love music , and I think if those girls next door do n't love music they are n't nice girls and to h  --  with them . " " Well , they complained , " said the bigger policeman . " Have a drink , " said Judd . And they all took drinks . The smaller policeman put another nickel in the slot machine and did n't get anything . " Listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't you got a soft pedal on that thing ? " " Yes . Got a soft pedal . " " Well , you promise to keep the soft pedal on so 's it wo n't disturb the girls and we 'll go . " " Fine , fine . " Judd was glowing and slapped the policeman on the back . " You 're gentlemen and you love music . " So the policemen departed and Judd went back to " A PerfectDay " and the " Sextette from Lucia . " But he did n't use the soft pedal . When he was rerolling a record Cunningham called to Judd . " Listen here , Watson , you promised those cops to softpedalthat thing . You 'll have ' em back here presently and they 'll take you down to the jug . " " Pardon me , Mr. Cunningham , " said Judd , " but I did n't promise the cops a thing . Legal technicality . They asked me to promise but I gave ' em legal technicality . Do n't you know cops have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't so pretty when it 's soft . " So the piano continued its deafening bam-bamming . And at 4:30 , after Jim Wong had sold a bottle of whisky to the poker table , there was vigorous rapping on the door again . Judd himself left the piano and opened the door and there were the policemen again.  |p209The  larger policeman was stern . " We got another complaint , Watson , and you got to stop that noise , " he said . " We could hear you a block away , " said the smaller policeman . " Aw , please , " begged Judd . " I did n't really promise last time . I just gave you a legal technicality . But I 'll promise and cross my heart this time I 'll use the soft pedal . " " Let 's see that piano , " said the larger policeman . Ile looked over the battered instrument and scratched his chin . Then , " If we had a piece of string maybe we could tic that soft pedal lever over so it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " volunteered Judd , eagerly . " Let 's have it . " So Judd fumbled and finally got the string out of his shoe and the policemen lashed the soft pedal lever over and had Judd try the piano . He played very softly . The policemen warned Judd that if they got one more complaintthey 'd take him to the cooler and departed . I Ie left the soft pedal on then , and pumped away at " A perfect Day " and the " Sextette from Lucia " until about 5 o'clock . Then he found the " Second Hungarian Rhapsody " and added that to his repertoire and played until 7 o'clock . When we adjourned and went to a restaurant for waffles and sausage , Judd 's legs were so lame he scarcely could walk . Also he had to limp to keep one shoe on because he 'd left his shoestring on the piano . Because I had won the most in the game  --  $14  --  I had to pay for the breakfasts , which came to nearly $3 . Soibelman is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't speak a word of English when he came to America at in . Now he has n't a trace of accent . He went to Columbia University in New York City for three years and has worked on newspapers all over the United States and in Europe . He lives out on East Twentieth Avenue and we walk outp210together in the morning after work . The other morning we got to talking literature and he confessed he has written four long novels and several hundred short stories without ever selling a line . I think that proves that one should n't start writingseriously until he is fully prepared for the work . I told him about the novel I shall write someday and he asked me how I liked Tolstoy and Dostoevski . When I admittedI had read neither he told me no one should even think of writing until he had read " Anna Karenina " and " War and Peace . " MARCH 21 , 1916 . There has been a heavy snowstorm , which kept Byron in the house for several days . But generally the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has in a year . Pearl is feeding him lots of milk and eggs and getting him out in the sunshine whenever possible . Pearl , however , does not like the terrace we are occupying and believes we owe it to Byron to have our own furniture and our own house ( rented at least ) while we are in a city like Denver where almost everyone lives in separate houses . She has found a store that will sell complete house furnishingson credit with a small down payment and when spring comes we shall look for a cottage with a nice yard . The United States is practically at war with Mexico and while I have felt that war can be avoided always if the statesmendo n't act like small boys , I admit there is a great deal of justification for America 's action in invading Mexico . About ten ( lays ago the Mexican rebel leader , Pancho Villa , led a party of 2,500 Mexican brigands across the American border and attacked Columbus , N. M. They raided the town , looting stores and setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp . Sixteen Americans were killed and many wounded while the handful of Ameri can troopers managed to exterminate about forty of the bandits.  |p211When  President Carranza showed little enthusiasm for running down the murderer , Villa , General Funston sent BrigadierGeneral John J. Pershing at the head of an army to cross the border and chase down the sometimes rebel and sometimes bandit Villa in the hills of Chihuahua . Villa has been a thorn in the side of Mexico for many years . There is no estimating the number of his robberies or the number of his murders . That he has a great following in Mexico can not be doubted , nor that many Mexicans believe him capable of anything  --  even to capturing the United States . Two or three days ago a newspaper in Durango , Mexico , printed the startling information that . Villa 11.1 ( 1 captured Texas and New Mexico and that President Wilson and his family were fleeing to Canada to escape the conqueror . Pancho Villa , however , made his fatal mistake in crossing the American border . He has learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns are horses of a different color . We received information tonight that Pershing 's cavalry has trapped and captured Villa in the mountains iro miles south of the New Mexico border without loss of a single American trooper . There may be international complications over Villa 's trial as Carranza has expressed resentmentat the American invasion . Perhaps , however , things may be simplified . Perhaps Villa may " attempt to escape " on the way back to the border and one of his guards regrettably may be forced to shoot him . Last Friday afternoon we took Byron to the Isis Theater and saw French government films of actual fighting on the western front . The pictures were very interesting although not very plain . The other picture was Theda Bara in " Gold and the Woman . " Pearl liked it , but I do n't care so much for the vampire . And of course Byron did n't know what it was all about . I am trying to talk Pearl into having the child 's hair cut . He is nearly 5 years old now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make him look more like a little girl . Pearl feels he will be a baby no longer once his hair is cut . That is one of the troubles with the boy , as I see it . Pearl does n't give him a chance to be a boy . I never see him except when he is with his mother and he is with her alone in the evenings when I have gone to work . Thus he always turns to her instead of to me and he actually seems jealous of me when Pearl and I are talking . I do n't like that , but I do n't seem able to do much about it . I have suggested several times that I take Byron out alone on nice afternoons but Pearl naturally does n't want to be left behind . So when we are all together it is , " Mama , what 's that ? Oh , Mama , looky . Oh , Mama , can I have an ice-cream cone ? " Pearl thinks the situation is a joke and I believe she may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very funny . I certainlydo n't want Byron to develop into a sissy , and I can only hope the situation will change as he grows older . Taking John Soibelman 's advice , I have " Anna Karenina " from the library , but am having a little difficulty in keeping the characters straight because of the names . Arkadyevitch and Golitsin and Vronsky and Dmitrievitch and Shtcherbatsky probably seem as plausible and common to Soibelman as Jones or O'Brien or Schwartz to me. if the European War should last until the first of August it will have run two years . In the beginning nobody believed it would continue for a year . At last , however , everything points to a termination of hostilities before summer . Germany is at the end of her resources  --  money , materials and man power . The stupid Crown Prince has killed off tens of thousands of German young men in a foolish assault on the forts at Verdun . Army after army was hurled into these attacks , always with the same result . The Germans were mowed down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported that at least 50,000 German dead are lying beforep213the French trenches . Among these are the corpses of Germany'sproudest cavalry brigade  --  the " Death Head Hussars , " which were called the " Crown Prince 's Own . " He ordered these horsemen to charge the array of machine gun nests and to take them at any cost . The Brigade was wiped out . It is noteworthy that the Crown Prince did not charge with them . JUNE II , 1916 . I am now telegraph editor of the Call and incidentally head of the copy desk . It is a terrific job , but probably will be easier when I get more used to the routine . On any other paper I have seen it was considered a man-sized job to be head of a universal desk . And it certainly was a man 's job being telegraph editor of the Tribune in San Francisco . Here , however , they are n't as particular about the copyreadingand the headlines as in San Francisco and also there is not quite as heavy a burden of telegraph copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Universal Service . George Empey , who formerly was in the slot and telegraph editor , took a job on the Associated Press , which made the opening for me . But I had been led to understand I should replace him in any event . My pay has been raised to $40 a week , which , I am told , is $2.50 more than Empey was getting . There is at least one unhappy circumstance connected with my promotion . A copyreader , an old-timer named Morris Johnson , whom everyone calls " Peg " because he has an artificialleg , resents my advancement over him and has been actingvery surly . He does n't actually stall on the job , but he does a lot of grumbling about the stories I give him and asks me many questions where the answers are most obvious . Especiallydoes he ask me questions about office policy which he really should know better than I. Of course what he is trying to do is to show me up before the others . We have rented a red brick cottage on Tejon Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an installment house . I paid $loo down and owe more than $300 , which I am supposed to pay off at the rate of $25 a month . Normally one would think that this would pay off the debt in a year . But the interest and brokerage charges and whatnot bring it up to 15 months . We have a golden oak library table in the living room and four chairs and a couch which can be opened out into a bed . Two of the chairs are rockers . And , of course , we moved our phonograph from San Francisco . Two fairly large framed pictures , one of a brightly colored mountain scene , which Pearl selected , and one called " The Lone Wolf , " which I picked out . It shows a snowy hill and a wolf in the foreground . It is night , which makes the sky a dark blue and the snow a light blue . The wolf is looking down into the valley at a small cluster of buildings and the whole effect is good , although Pearl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a mantel and fireplace and I have stacked my books on the mantel on each side of the clock . I do not care much for the clock . It is gilt and quite fancy and it strikes too loud and fast . In the living room we have a rather pretty flowered rug . But the dining room rug is a mixture of yellows and purples which seems loud to me . Then we have a round dining table of golden oak and six chairs . Our bedroom has an iron bed painted bronze and a mahoganyveneer dresser and chiffonier with fancy brass handles on the drawers . Byron has a small iron bed and a dresser and a little chair . We already had a high chair for him , which he has outgrown , but Pearl keeps it in the kitchen now . She has taken the arms off and sits on it to work . There was a gas range in the house , so we did n't have to buy that . But we got an icebox and kitchen table and chairs and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And we got an ironing board and flatirons and kitchen pots and pans and spiders , which they call skillets out here , and dishes and some silverware . After we were moving in Pearl discovered there weren'tp215any lace curtains and , being used to living in furnished places , had n't thought about needing them . So she had to rush over to the Golden Eagle and buy some lace curtains and rods to hold them up . After that we discovered there were n't any electric bulbs left in the sockets and we had to go buy them . Our house is across the Twentieth Street viaduct from the downtown section , so it is too far to walk . This is bad in one way because if I miss an owl car in the morning ( which I often do ) I have to wait an hour for another . Perhaps , however , I shall get my schedule routinized later so I can catch the regular 2-o'clock car . I have made one discovery already in the matter of systematizingwork . Empey always went out to lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour or so . I tried that at first , putting Soibelman in the slot while I was gone . But of course Soibelman could n't send any copy to the composing room while I was out , not knowing what I had handled before or not knowing the status of any runningstories except those he had handled himself . So necessarily the copy stacked up , both telegraph and local , and it would take me the best part of an hour to get things straightenedout after I returned . The solution of this was quite simple . I do n't go out to lunch now . I send a copy boy to the near-by " Greasy Spoon " and have him bring me a tray with a big bowl of chili con carne and crackers and a ham sandwichand a cup of coffee . Chili is very nutritious and I am fond of it . I can cat the chili with a spoon in one hand and sort and deal copy with the other . Thus I am in pretty fair shape for the inside of the home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I go into conference with Harvey O'Brien , the news editor , on Page One . The Republican convention nominated Charles Evans Hughes for President and Charles W. Fairbanks for VicePresident . Hughes is a former governor of New York and probably too good a man to be used as a burnt offeringp216against Woodrow Wilson . Naturally , the Democrats will renominateWilson and he should win a larger vote even than in 1912 . The nation owes Wilson a debt of gratitude for the fact that he has kept us out of the European war despite the clamorings of such jingoes as Theodore Roosevelt . Still the war goes on , although it appears that Germany is near exhaustion . But the fact remains that the Germans still are doing their fighting in France , Belgium and Russia . And their submarine warfare is becoming more terrible week by week . Last week the British cruiser Hampshire hit a mine and sank , taking to death with its crew , Lord Kitchener , British minister of war . JUNE 23 , 1916 . Sunday , being the lightest night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took the " far-famed Georgetown loop " trip today . The narrow-gauge train goes up Clear Creek canyon to Georgetown and Silver Plume , making a loop across an awesome gulch over a spindly bridge . Never have I seen such wonderful scenery . We took a picnic lunch and ate it above Silver Plume between trains . Byron was greatly excited over the brawling stream and all . It was the first time I had ever ridden on a train with him . He is lookingmuch better and apparently is feeling fine . Certainly it was a wise move , bringing him to Colorado when we did . Friday Carranza troops attacked the column of cavalry led by General Pershing in search of the bandit , Pancho Villa . Twenty-three Americans were captured . It would seem that Pershing is on a hopeless quest . It would seem that he better be withdrawn before the United States is embroiled in a war with Mexico . Because our manufacturers are persistently shippingammunition and guns to the Allies , Germany might welcomean opportunity to aid Mexico in warring on America and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last week I had another vivid dream of Frances . She was standing before the ironing board in her kitchen ironingp217clothes and from the clothesbasket she brought out the blue print she was wearing when little Carol was killed . The baby was wearing a frock of the same material at the time . When Frances brought out this dress it suddenly reminded her of Carol . She held it in both hands and burst into tears . My eyes have been bothering Inc a great deal lately . Sometimesthey ache so much after I have got home and to bed that I ca n't sleep . I 'm afraid 1 shall have to go to an oculist and get glasses . But I hate to give itt to that . My eyes have always been so strong , but I must admit 1 have abused them a lot . Peg Johnson is making a great play for favor in the eyes of Harvey O'Brien , the dyspeptic news editor , laughing loudly at anything even faintly resembling a joke that O'Brien tells . Saturday night O'Brien came over to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know last winter on the western front the Germans put up a sign calculated to disconcert the British in the opposite trenches . The sign read ' Gott Mit Uns , ' which meant of course , ' God is with us . ' But that did n't feaze the Tommies . They put up a sign reading , ' We got mittens too . ' " At that Johnson burst into such a gale of laughter he could have been heard a block away . " We got mittens too , " he chortled and slapped his thigh . " Say , that 's good . We got mittens too . " And O'Brien minced back to his desk as pleased as a dog that 's just chased an automobile out of the block . I do n't think O'Brien cares much for me and I can see Johnson is working on that . Perhaps I should feel worried about the situation if it were n't for Fred Gotchell , the managing editor . Gotchell , a burly fellow with great nervous energy , is the man who matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work and is very friendly with me . He 'll come in along about ro o'clock and stop at the copy desk to slap me on the shoulder.  | " I low 's everything , Homer , old boy ? " he 'll ask . Then I 'll tell him what is going on and he 'll go on into his office often without even going over to talk with O'Brien . I always try to handle the lead story of the night myself . Gotchell often comes out after an edition and asks who wrote this head or that 8-column line . Sometimes he has most emphaticobjections and tells me not to let them get away with things of that sort . At other times he has high praise for the line or head , and most often on those occasions it has been my own work that met his approval . So I feel I have nothing to worry about despite the O'Brien-Johnson combination . Of course O'Brien is in a position to make me look very bad if he chooses . I do n't believe he could actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , he probably could make me appear sufficiently bad that Gotchell would want to fire me . But nevertheless , I am in a position to make O'Brien look very bad also . Usually he is late in getting his Page One dummy scheduled , so we have to work like fiends to get the copy to the composing room in time . It would be a simple matter for me to hold back some key story for three or four pages , making them go into the stereotypers in a bunch . I could make every edition late except the first street edition , which O'Brien does n't dummy . He could n't prove a thing and it would give him a had record . Of course I would n't do a thing like that unless he forced me to it , but at least he should know that I have several potent weapons at my command . I have found out how Johnson lost his leg . He was working on the Times during the bloody mine strike in southern Coloradotwo years ago . His sympathies were with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went down to help the miners fight the National Guard . Because he had served an enlistment in the regular army during his youth , he knew something of military affairs and he tried to organize the strikers on semiarmy lines for the battle.  |p219Then  he saw that the militia had some machine guns trained on the camp and conceived what seemed to him to be a bright idea . One night late he got a good-looking sister of a miner to play a vampire role on one of the sentries and while the sentry was thus engaged , Johnson and several of his followers slipped down and stole a machine gun and a box of ammunition . They took the gun to a promontory which overlooked the militia camp , set it up and at dawn opened fire . But the machine gun jammed after a few shots and Johnson , old soldier though he was , did n't know enough about a machine gun to get it going again . Consequently the National Guardsmenopened a heavy fire which killed one of the strikers and wounded Johnson in the leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long before he got medical attention and the wound became infected . A doctor in Trinidad amputated his leg to save his life . From my present perspective that seems to have been a somewhat unnecessary procedure . SEPTEMBER 17 , 1916 . We have had a very pleasant summer and now Byron is a schoolboy . He started to Bryant School kindergarten last week and is most proud of himself with his new boy haircut and suit of clothes . It is about three blocks to the school on West Thirty-sixth Avenue and he trudges off in the morning , very much the big boy . It about broke Pearl 's heart to have his hair cut and to see him going to school , but she has some other interests now and is quite content . Boyd Ferguson , who is assistant city editor on the Call , lives only a few blocks away on Umatilla Street and Pearl and Violet Ferguson have become good friends . Mrs. Ferguson has made Pearl acquainted with several other young women who live near by and they meet frequently to play bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once we took the narrow-gauge railroad over to Mountp220Morrison , hired a burro to carry Byron and the lunch basket and walked up into the Park of the Red Rocks where the great slabs of upended sandstone have been eroded into wonderful and fantastic shapes . While there I killed a rattlesnake with a stone and Pearl ripped a heel off her slipper . With a spike heel on one foot and no heel on the other she was unable to walk back to the railroad , so she had to ride the burro and I had to carry Byron most of the way . I was exhausted by the time we got back and felt pretty sorry for the little donkey . They are amazingly sturdy , however , and he did n't seem any worse for carrying Pearl 's 150 pounds two or three miles . A more wonderful trip was on the Moffat Road to the crest of the Continental Divide at Corona . It was a hot day in July that we took this trip but there were snowbanks at the top and hot coffee and hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to give in and go to an occulist . Now I am wearing horn-rimmed glasses which do n't look as bad as I had feared . And certainly I feel a lot better and am not troubled so much with headaches . We now are in the midst of one of the most bitter political campaigns on record . Governor Hughes has been touring the country , but he is a man of frigid personality and an indifferentorator . He was given a fine reception in Denver , but it was the reception which would be accorded any person who has been distinguished by the presidential nomination of a major party . Theodore Roosevelt is doing the major campaigning for Hughes , attacking Wilson with such unrestrained bitterness that I imagine he is making votes for the Democratic Party rather than for Hughes . Roosevelt charges Wilson with being a weakling who has compromised the honor of America . Particularly does he rant at the government 's failure to send a huge military force intop22IMexico and capture Pancho Villa . He shouts that Wilson is guilty of the murder of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had not displayed firm enough a hand to frighten the Mexican bandits . Ile also makes the ridiculous charge that had Wilson been firm enough with Germany in the beginning Germany would not have dared to engage in her submarine warfare , that Germany would not have dared sink even the Lusitania . The Democrats are not even bothering to stress the great works of the present administration , to emphasize the Federal Reserve act which will prevent panics such as that which gripped the nation in 1907 during Roosevelt 's administration , nor of the Adamson bill signed this month by Wilson which provides an 8-hour day for railroad men , thus preventing the wave of railroad wrecks which killed thousands during Roosevelt'sterm . There is a good deal of argument that a man is never injured by the hours he works , but by what he does when he is off work . No doubt there is a great deal of truth to that attitude , ordinarily . An 8-hour day never would be practicable at many occupations  --  notably the newspaper business  --  butit has been proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigilance of a railroad engineer . Despite Republican opposition , most people agree now that 8 hours is enough for an engineer to stay at the throttle when the lives of hundreds depend on his wakefulness . The Democrats are waging this campaign on one premise . That is , " He Kept Us Out of War . " And what a potent sentence that is with wise Americans . But there are others , not so wise , who assail Wilson for a " wishy-washy " foreign policy and not only are going to vote for Hughes , but firmly believe he will be elected . It is difficult for me to understand how anyone can attack Wilson 's foreign policy unless he actually wants the United States to enter the European War . Wilson 's consistent policyp222is to preserve peace . The only other possible policy would be war . I am going to save every penny I can above what we need for living expenses and to pay the furniture installments and bet all I can on this election . In that I have a dark plot forming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I shall salt away my winnings carefully for a purpose . Next summer I shall have a vacation coming . And I shall start promoting the idea in the spring that I need to get away from everything for a while , that I need to go back in the hills and rough it . Then I shall take a train to Raleigh , Utah . NOVEMBER 12 , 1916 . Last Tuesday undoubtedly was the most terrific national election in history . President Wilson was reelectedfor which the whole nation has reason to thank Providence . But it was by a narrow margin and the result was in doubt until well along the next day . Even now the betting commissioners will not pay off until after the official count . I had bet $35 at even money and eventually will get my $7o , minus the commissioner 's 5% but I have been somewhat embarrassed financially , as they say , while the money is held up . As a matter of fact , I took it for granted the commissioner would pay off as soon as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clamoring for a new coat , I gave her $25 Thursday which was to go to the furniture house , because I supposed I could collect my $66.5o on the way to work . When that was impossible I tried to stave off the furniture house for a week and they grew practically insulting . Then , much as I hated to , I borrowed $25 from John Soibelman . It is very bad policy to borrow from a man who is working under one , but I know Soibelman is not a man to presume on that sort of thing . Also , I knew he had the money . The election itself was a great strain on me . I felt the issues so keenly that I could n't believe the people at large couldp223help seeing the situation as it is . But about to o'clock Tuesday night I realized I had been too confident . There are so many obscure items to be considered in a national election , so many hidden elements of which even a telegraph editor can not be cognizant . Of course I expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect anything else except when the Republican Party was split as in 1912 . But I had taken it for granted that Wilson would carry New York State and when the returns showed that Hughes was sweeping both New York and Pennsylvania I felt actually ill . Then New Jersey and Illinois gave substantial leads to the Republicans and Michigan joined the parade . All of the big states seemed to be falling into line with each succeeding bulletin . Then about to o'clock the Associated Press boy spiked a piece of paper on the spindle , calling out , " Flash ! " I pulled off the sheet and it read : NEW YORK WORLD CONCEDESHUGHES ELECTIONAnd the World had been Wilson 's staunchest supporter in New York . I called out the flash to Gotchell and O'Brien . Gotchell grinned . " Well , " he said , " it 's all over . Shoot an extra . " So I wrote the saddest 8-column line I ever turned out , in 12o-point . It react , HUGHES WINS IN LANDSLIDEand we put out the extra . The office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the management to gain entree . They crowded around the copy desk , leaning over my neck to read the bulletins as I got them , breathing stale , secondhandp224Cheyenne whisky in my face . The whole staff was at work on the local and state angles and returns , including those off all the runs except the police beat . And in addition virtually the whole business office crew was working at benches , running adding machines and computing the returns as they came in by telephone . Also at a long table were six or eight girls from the business office and Miss Murray , the society editress , with telephone headsets on answering the hundreds of queries that came in . Their soprano voices rose above the general din and clatter of typewriters , telegraph instruments and excited male voices . Now excitement entered the girls ' voices too . They were higher pitched and louder . " Yes , Hughes is elected . Hughes is elected . Yes , Hughes has won New York . Hughes . . . Hughes is ahead in Illinois . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . Pennsylvania ? Hughes wins Pennsylvania . " And the visiting politicians , almost all of whom were Republicans , were jubilant . They cheered when they caught sight of additional Hughes victories over my shoulder . One sleek young fellow with a big cigar held importantly in his mouth slapped me on the back . " Ai n't that great , old man ? " he chortled . " Yes , " I said , " if you 're ready to shoulder a gun and go to France . " At midnight the office had sandwiches , pie and coffee brought in for the workers who had n't had time to go to lunch . The visiting politicians made great headway . They dropped sandwich crumbs down my neck as they read bulktinsover my shoulder . We on the copy desk were too busy getting out the North Mail to eat for half an hour . By that time the food was pretty well pawed over . But we did get some lukewarm coffee and Soibelman rescued an apple pie from the debris which had n't much coffee spilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a big dill pickle which he divided , cutting it up with his copy shears.  |p225Along  then the tide began to turn . Wilson was leading in Ohio . Of course the solid Smith was going Democratic and most of the returns from the West were going right . Colorado unmistakably was for Wilson . " It does n't make any difference , " O'Brien said . " Hughes has got New York and Pennsylvania and Michigan . He 's way ahead in Illinois . Wilson ca n't win without those . " But by dawn it appeared that Wilson might win without the big states . At any rate the election was very close . The phone girls were sent home about 3 a.m. , but more were brought on at 6:3o . And by 7 o'clock their voices were chanting a new song as people got up and phoned for more information . They had gone to bed with Hughes apparently elected by a landslide . Now they were incredulous as the girls reported , " It 's very close , but Wilson is leading . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ohio . Colorado 's gone Democratic . California still is in doubt . Yes , but Wilson 's ahead . No , Hughes is not elected yet . It 's very close . " All day Wednesday we worked , putting out extras , for the election service continued EOS , or Extraordinary Service , which means papers can extra on A.P . news at any time . And we worked all Wednesday night , too , although young Frank Chapin went to sleep in his chair at ro o'clock and I made him go home . In all , I worked steadily from noon Tuesday until 3 o'clock Thursday morning , a total of 39 hours . When he went out to lunch Wednesday evening Peg Johnson brought a quart of whisky from the Press Club . He was pretty drunk on the job by midnight , which , with Chapin gone , made the burden very heavy for Soibelman and me . But I could n't censure him very well , because both Soibelman and I had taken several drinks from his bottle . On the way home I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the line . The conductor woke me at my stop on the return trip.  | " Must have been quite an election for you , " he said . From my unshaven , bleary-eyed appearance , he judged I had been on a two-day drunk . As it turned out , California went for Wilson-466,200 to 462,394 and was the deciding factor in the election . Wilson 's electoral vote will be 277 to Hughes ' 254 . Thus , had less than 2,000 California voters cast their ballots for Hughes instead of Wilson , California 's 13 electoral votes would have gone into the Republican column and Hughes would have been elected with 267 electoral votes to Wilson 's 264 . We can all be thankful for a very stupid political blunder made by Hughes on his West Coast campaigning tour . There can be little doubt that this blunder cost him many times2,000 votes . Had Hughes been acquainted with the 1912 election he would have known Hiram Johnson 's immense popularity in California . The mere fact that Johnson was running for VicePresidenton the Bull Moose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hughes was on the Coast he seemingly snubbed Johnson deliberately . He not only failed to go to see the senator but did n't invite Johnson to visit him . As a consequence , everyone in the state knew Johnson was deeply hurt and that he had refused to take the stump in his own state in behalf of the icy New Yorker . FEBRUARY 4 , 1917 . Right after Christmas , when he had eaten too much candy and stuff , Byron came down with a protracted cold which necessitated keeping him from school . Finally Dr. Valentine decided his frequent colds were a result of adenoids and infected tonsils . He urged us to have them out as soon as his current cold was better . So last Tuesday we took him to the Children 's Hospital and had the operation . It took a great deal of argument on the part of the doctor and on my part too to get Pearl to agree to the operation.  | " I ca n't bear , " she would say , " to think of the little precious being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ether . I ca n't bear . to think of him lying there unconscious while all those white-coated men and nurses slash away at his poor little throat with shiny , sharp knives . " " But it wo n't last but a little while , " I toll her . " And in a few days the soreness will be gone and hell grow into a sturdy , healthy boy . " " I do n't like this business of operating on babies , " she said . " Like as not he 'll outgrow these colds anyhow . I le 's been a lot better since we moved to Denver . " " Now , Pearl , " I argued , " you know he has one cold alter another in the winter . Something 's got to be done or he 'll be an invalid all his life . Do n't you trust I ) r . Valentine when he says Byron 's tonsils are infected ? Do n't you know he 's said the boy 's system ca n't absorb the poison from the tonsils indefinitely ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open and cut down his resistance so he can be a victim to most any disease that comes along . " " Of course he has his mouth open when he has a cold , " Pearl objected . " Who do n't ? And children do die from having their tonsils taken out . I 've heard of ever so many cases . Suppose we take him to the hospital and he dies there . Whose fault will that be ? " " Suppose , " I said , " we do n't take the doctor 's advice and the poison from those diseased tonsils affects Byron 's heart and he dies because we neglected to give him the treatment the doctor knows he needs . Whose fault will that be ? " So finally Pearl gave in and we took him to the hospital . Byron was n't nervous , not knowing what was going to happen to him . He really was interested in the whole proceeding and was laughing when they wheeled him away on the rolling stretcher . He called out in his high-pitched voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they rolled him through the door.  |p228Then  Pearl broke down completely . She cried until they came to us and told us the operation was over and that Byron was coming out from under the anesthetic in his room . Pearl stayed with him all that night and we brought him home Wednesday evening . He was a pretty sick boy for 24 hours , but he 's recovering in fine shape now . I feel certain we have got to the root of his trouble and he will be a different boy from now on . And now that it 's over Pearl is glad we had the operation . I had to dig into my secret vacation fund which I won on the election to pay for the hospital and operation . But I certainly do n't begrudge it . Probably it would be a bad thing for me to go to Raleigh , Utah , anyhow . Much as I should enjoy seeing Frances , it would be an upsetting experience . My dreams of her continue on an average of once a week . I awoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw her working in her kitchen , which I know now better than our own . Frances has no gas to cook with as has Pearl . She burns wood in a range and was having trouble finding sticks in the woodbox which would fit . Most of them Clark had brought in were too big and knotty to go in . So Frances had to put on an old sweater and go out in the snow and chop some more wood . One would think a husband would be more considerate of his wife . Frances still is looking too thin . And she still is sorrowing over the death of little Carol . It now seems that war with Germany is practically inevitable . Thursday the Kaiser broke his agreement with President Wilson and opened unrestricted submarine warfare on merchantships . As a consequence , Wilson broke off diplomatic relations with Germany yesterday . Germany apparently is bound to force America into the war and the Kaiser will live to regret it . Tonight Pearl and Violet Ferguson went down to see ap229movie , Annette Kellermann in " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harold Bell Wright 's latest novel , " When A Man 's a Man . " h is a story of Arizona and a stranger from the city who proves himself a man on the unfenced range . Somehow I fund the writing rather florid . It annoys me . JUNE 3 , 1917 . Tuesday every man in the United States between the ages of 21 and 31 , inclusive , must register for military service . While I certainly would find no joy in the army , especially living in the mud of French trenches , 1 can not help a strange sense of regret that I am 34 . There is a sense of being left out of something very important and very exciting . ( i course I would n't think of volunteering . I have Pearl and Byron to think of . But if I were summoned and could n't help it , that would be another matter . I am much opposed to war . It seems to me to he the height of international insanity . But I must admit the United States did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany , or rather the Kaiser and his Kultur , forced us in . As a matter of fact , President Wilson has made it plain we are not waging war against the German people  --  it is only the imperial German government that has provoked America into using force . Germany was given warning after warning . Then in February the Kaiser opened unrestricted submarine warfare and Wilson gave his final warning in breaking off diplomatic relations . Germany 's answer was sinkingthree American vessels . So Wilson called a special session of Congress and on April 6 war was declared . In order to make it fair to all , it was decided in May to use selective conscription in raising the army . That is the draft registration which is called for Tuesday . Frank Chapin did n't wait for the registration . Early in May he gave me a week 's notice and enlisted in the regularp230army . He is in camp down in Texas now . His place has been taken by Warren Reeves , a middle-aged ex-copyreader who has been working as a bond salesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad to take a copyreader 's job . Dana Garfield , who had been covering the courthouse for us , is at Fort Riley , Kansas , learning to be an officer as is young Barney Pratt , who was going to the University of Denver and working as a cub reporter nights . Boyd Ferguson , who is 32 and exempt from the draft , is trying to convince his wife that she could make her own living if he went to training camp . He put in some time in the Indiana National Guard and likes military life . Fred Gotchell has an automobile and he took Bill Cunninghamand me out to Fort Logan one morning while Frank Chapin was there . We watched the recruits drilling across a field . They had n't got uniforms yet and did n't look particularlysoldierly , but when we picked out Chapin in his familiar , battered felt hat we all had a strange thrill . Gotchell 's face was beaming . " There 's the boy , " he cried . " On the end of the second row . See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chapin whom I knew so well slouched over the copy desk , using that same o1 ( 1 hat as an eyeshade , now was standingstraight with his chest out and obeying like a machine the barking commands of a blue-jawed drill sergeant . When they finally called a recess , we shouted to Chapin and he came over to our car . His face was red with sunburn and he looked weary . But he was very pleased to see us . Gotchell shook hands with him and held to his hand . His voice was husky . " Frank , " he said , " I 'm proud of you , boy . I 'm proud of you . Give the Kaiser a kick in the pants for men personally , and when you come back you 've got a job as long as I 'm in a position to give jobs  --  even if I 've got to fire such stick-in-the-muds as Zigler and Cunningham here . " Frank said he expected to be sent to join some regular armyp231regiment in a day or so and believed he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got a short letter from him in about ten days . He said he had a uniform and rifle now and was learning how to take care of hot h . He is such a boy , not quite 21 , and he seems much younger as he is n't very robust . I lc came to the Call when he was 17 and just out of high school . For three years he was a reporter and has been reading copy for a year . For his experience , he is a very good copyreader too . I have had to watch his editing a little , but he has a knack of expression and writes a better feature head than most of the older fellows . I have just read a little book called " Speaking of Operations  --  " by Irvin S. Cobb . It is mildly funny . I wish Mr. Cobb would n't try to be a comic writer . He can write serious fiction so well and it 's a shame for him to waste his time and talents on humor . OCTOBER 28 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even for us stay-at-homes . One day a week we are supposed to cat no meat . One day a week we are supposed to eat no wheat . We must conserve on every foodstuff that can be shipped to the Allies , for it has become apparent that food will win the war . In September Congress prohibited the manufacture of intoxicantsfor the duration of the war . The grain must be used to feed our soldiers and the soldiers of England and France . And pending in Congress ( already passed by the Senate ) is an amendment to the Constitution which would prohibit the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquor forever . There is a good deal of opposition to that amendment , but I am inclined to believe it a good thing . I have enjoyed drinking . But I must admit it has caused me a good deal of trouble also . I seriously believe the world would be better off without liquor and saloons . I know that saloons are a breeding place of political corruption and crime . I know that many lives have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be happy in the knowledge that there will be no liquor and no saloons when Byron grows up , that there will be no danger of drink ruining his bright future . Whisky is of doubtful value even as a medicine , doctors are now beginning to recognize . It really is a relic of the Dark Ages and it is inevitable that the prohibition amendment will be enacted . Another progressive measure , inevitable of adoption , is woman suffrage . Of course some of the suffragettes have made nuisances of themselves , such as picketing the White House last summer and being thrown in jail . But William J. Bryan has spoken in defense of the movement several times and last week President Wilson urged the states to adopt woman suffrage . Political corruption has been the bane of American democracy . And the one sure way to clear out the crooked politicians is to give women the vote . The war has hit our staff pretty hard . Ferguson is a lieutenantat Camp Dodge , Iowa . Garfield and Pratt are officers at Camp Kearney , California . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined the marines as a private and nobody has heard from him . Chester Loomis , Karl Schlossen and Jimmy Manguso , the office boy , who no one dreamed was 21 , were drafted and arc in General Wood 's division and John Soibelman enlisted in the navy because , he said , he admires Joseph Conrad 's sea stories so much . Frank Chapin is in France . I got one letter from there headed " Somewhere in France , " but it was heavily censored with indelible ink and we could n't make out much except that he is well . One thing that delighted me about Wilson 's conduct of the war was his refusal to allow Theodore Roosevelt to raise a division and take it to France . Secretary of War Baker told him that all generals for volunteer troops were to be taken from the regular army.  |p233Roosevelt  's reply to that was that he is a retired commander in chief of the army , meaning President , and that he was eligible to take any position of command over United States troops . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do his service too veil . It is more likely that Wilson feared Roosevelt , by excess of zeal , love of grandstanding and lack of judgment , would get 25,000 men or so killed off needlessly . As a matter of fact , Roosevelt 's military experience consists of being appointed lieutenant colonel over a group of volunteersin the Spanish-American War . Even in his famous charge up San Juan Hill , the story is he blundered into a trap and would have got his command annihilated if a negro regiment had n't come to his rescue . JANUARY 21 , 1918 . The war is having a profound effect on us all . For one thing , we are so shorthanded at the office I am forced to work seven days a week virtually every week . Today was the first day off I have had since early in November . We celebrated by going downtown to a movie and seeing Charles Ray in " His Own Home Town . " Ray is a good actor . He portrays the role of the guileless small-town boy to perfection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type . I am glad that my name does n't sound as German as Schultz or Hegendorfer . People with German names are automatically suspected of giving aid to the enemy or planning to wreck something American . Consequently their windows are broken and they have to endure insults from the ultrapatriotic unless they can display service flags in their windows . Business of the Kaiserhof Hotel at Seventeenth and Welton streets was falling off badly . So they changed the name of the place to the Kenmark . I believe the most spectacular headline of the war so far was printed in the Denver Express , a little labor newspaper published by the Scripps-McRae syndicate . It was an 8-column line on the occasion of General Allenby 's entering Jerusalem after Goo years of Turkish rule . The line read : British Capture Christ 's Home TownFEBRUARY 9 , 1919 . This is the first day off I have had in more than a year . The war is over . The flu is virtually over . And I feel truly as if I had been in a war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newspaper business did n't have a harder time than Dana Garfield and Barney Pratt who fought the war in a California training camp and came home in splendid uniforms and boots and spurs to be regarded as heroes . We at home worked night and day without rest , went without sugar and meat and wheat so the soldier boys like Garfield and Pratt could have plenty . Of course it was different with those who did the fighting . I understand Frank Chapin was badly wounded , but we have heard nothing from him in months . Last fall , before the Armistice , I got a postcard from John Soibelman from Brest , France , saying he was in the transport service . " Having wonderful time , " he wrote , " wish you were here . " So did I.Now President Wilson is in Paris working to make the peace permanent . He is forming a League of Nations which will outlaw war , using the combined power of the United States , Britain , France and the other Allies to force peace upon the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson will go down in history as the greatest man ever . Last month Nebraska ratified the Eighteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution . Being the thirty-sixth state to take such action , the prohibition of the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors in the United States will become a fact next January . I was amused at the attitude of Jim Wong , Press Clubp235steward , on prohibition . I rarely drink any more , but this morning after work both Bill Cunningham and I were very tired and we decided to step over and get a " shot in the arm " before taking our owl cars home . So while Jim Wong was fixing our hot rum slings I asked him what he thought of prohibition coining . The old Chinese twisted his mouth . " Damn good , " he said . " Whisky no damn good . Whisky cy'nide . Drinkum cy'nide , fall down dead . " Two or three years ago there was a reporter here named Paul Underwood who wanted to become an author . I le took his writing very seriously and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours when he should have been sleeping , in writing short stories . But he had n't prepared himself fully for that career and consequently could n't sell a single story . In that Underwood was similar to Soibelman . But he apparentlydid n't have the moral stamini to accept rejections as philosophically as did Soibelman . Or perhaps there was a girl . At any rate Underwood brooded over his failures and became convinced he never could make a success at anything . So he stole a little cyanide of potassium from the engraving room and went to the Press Club . He slumped into a chair in the lounge and called to Jim for a double whisky . And when Jim served him Underwood dropped the cyanide into the glass and stood up . " Well , Jim , " he said , " here goes nothing . " He tossed off the drink and fell dead at Jim 's feet . Jim heard there was cyanide in Underwood 's whisky and no matter of argument could convince him there was n't a certain amount , sometimes more and sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe he has served a drink of whisky since that he has n't expected the drinker to fall dead as did Underwood . Thus his warning , " Drinkum cy'nide , fall down dead . " Of course Colorado has had state prohibition ever since Ip236have been here . But it has not been very effective . Cheyenne , Wyoming , is only a little more than a hundred miles away and there has been a big business trucking whisky down from there . It will be different when there is a federal law . The war brought me raises in salary which have increased my pay to $5o a week . From that I have managed to accumulate$200 in Liberty Bonds and would have more except that Pearl got the flu and we had to have a nurse . I was lucky to find one at that . It has been more than a year since I have read a book . And I believe it has been that long since I have read a magazineor gone to a picture show . There has been nothing but work and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than two or three weeks of doing nothing and sleeping all I want to sleep . It is showing on me too . My face is becoming lined and gray hair is beginning to be noticeableat the sides of my head . Well , we should have a good staff by summer when the soldiers are all demobilized and we should have vacations again . Then I shall get a rest . And then I mean to do the thing I have been planning to do ever since I have been in Denver . That is , go over to Raleigh , Utah , and see Frances . My dreams of her have been less frequent of late , but that has been mainly because I have been too tired to dream . Last November , 1 believe it was , I had a series of vivid dreams , however , wherein she was very sick with the flu . For a while there was an old neighbor woman who dropped in to care for Fran , but finally this Samaritan came down with the plague herself and died . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be 36 now , but in my dreams she is just as beautiful as when I first saw her 20 years ago . I wonder if my dreams are fooling me in that . She has had so much trouble and so much sickness . It does n't seem possible that her charms have n't faded . I may be shocked when I see herp237next summer . But I do n't think so . Fran 's beauty came from within . I do n't believe it will ever fade . OCTOBER 19 , 1919 . I seem to have got out of the habit of keeping this record . President Wilson 's peace treaty which contains the League of Nations plan has been ratified by Great Britain and Italy and last Monday by France . The new German Republic headed by President Ebert has signed it . But in the United States Senate there is opposition . The Republican enemies of Wilson and the traitors in his own party such as Jim Reed of Missouri are trying to keep us from entangling alliances with foreign powers . They should know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a covenant . They should know from experience that our national affairs are so entwined with those of Europe as to imperil our own peace when war flares forth across the Atlantic . And I do n't believe there is record of the gentlemen who are fighting the League of Nations voting against entry to the World War . In any event it seems that Wilson is strong enough to force Congress to ratify the peace treaty . I took my vacation at home and thoroughly enjoyed it with two new books which I bought , although I could ill afford them . They are " Winesburg , Ohio " by Sherwood Anderson and " Twelve Men " by Theodore Dreiser , a former newspaperman . " Winesburg , Ohio " opened a new door of fiction to me . It gives the impression of being not fiction , but reality . After reading it I suddenly realized that practically every book I have ever read was following a set formula just as newspaper stories follow set formulas . And the formula has not been based on actuality , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by novelists as if it were law . Anderson follows no law except the law of life , the law of reality . His book is most refreshing and thought-provoking.  | Dreiser does not write as well as Anderson . I have the impression that he was like many reporters  --  too careless to read over his news stories in the paper to see what the copyreadersdid to them . Had he done that he would have learned a few fundamentals of English construction which would help his serious writing . Nevertheless , Dreiser has wonderful powers of observation and the faculty of remembering what he observes . His book is a series of twelve essays about men he has known  --  some of them newspapermen . And despite his clumsy writing , he manages to paint very vivid pictures . I should say Dreiser is a magnificent reporter , but he should be required to phone all his books to a good rewrite man . I spent my vacation reading these books on the front porch of our house on Umatilla Street . We moved a block west and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our new place is much better and newer and costs only $2.50 a month more than the other . We also bought a piano this spring ( on time ) for $35o and started Byron taking music lessons . I do n't know enough about music to tell , myself , but they say the boy is doing wonderfully well , although he requires a great deal of coaxing to keep up his practice . In June Pearl came down with acute appendicitis and had to be rushed to St. Luke 's Hospital for an operation . She came through very well , but was unable to do her housework for five weeks . That took my Liberty Bonds and the rest of my savings . Now , counting the piano , we are so badly in debt that it frightens me to think about it . Last Sunday night we went to a bridge party at the Fergusons . I had a miserable time . I ca n't play bridge well and I detest the game . But Violet Ferguson was my partner and she grew quite nasty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got home around midnight . He refused point-blank to play and he and I adjourned to the basement where hep239is accumulating a stock of liquor against prohibition . We had several drinks and he told me about the war  --  or at least his part in it . He was stationed at Bordeaux in the Service of Supply and had some wild times . Poor Frank Chapin did n't get back until last month . He had been in a hospital in France for several months . Frank 's right arm is gone above the elbow , shattered by shrapnel . Three days passed after his wound before he could reach a base hospital and by that time gangrene had set in , necessitatingamputation . The boy ( he looks 40 now ) is trying bravely to learn to write with his left hand and is reading copy on the desk . He says when the stump gets healed enough the government will give him an artificial arm which he can use to hold the copy down . Now he has a block of lead f win the composing room which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his left hand . No one has heard a word from John Soihclnian . I suspect he has gone back to Russia . He held the czarist government in hatred and his political views were definitely socialistic . JANUARY 10 , 1920 . The League of Nations now is a fact , despite the mad action of the United States Senate in refusing to ratify it . Today representatives of thirteen nations will meet in Geneva , Switzerland , to complete organization of the League , which will act as a central government over nations of the world  --  excluding the United States . That is , excluding the United States until after election this fall . Those senators who repudiated President Wilson 's magnificent plan will get their own repudiation at the hands of the voters . I have just read " Moon and Sixpence " by Somerset Maugham . And I am finding my whole attitude toward literatureundergoing a renascence . My whole attitude toward life , as a matter of fact.  | I believe I have been overinfluenced by an artificial standard of life and literature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start writing while under that influence . Byron now is wearing glasses . The boy had been troubled with headaches and finally his teacher suggested he might need glasses and we took him to an oculist . We found he was suffering from astigmatism and that he is slightly nearsighted . The oculist believed the glasses might correct the faults and that he may be able to discard glasses when he is to or ii . The glasses give his thin little face an odd , owlish appearance , but it ca n't be helped . I could wish that he were inclined to play more with the other boys . That would be good for his health . But he is a very studious child and he prefers to read or to play with his blocks or train than to get out and snowball and coast with the other boys . He is doing very well in school , getting grades in the 90 's in every subject . Harvey Thorpe is back on the paper from the marines and is working on the copy desk . In slack periods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . It would appear that the war was one long wild party with Frenchwomenand cognac . Thorpe is an awful liar . One day he pulled a handful of medals from his pocket  --  the French Croix de Guerre , the French Mcdaille Militaire and the American Distinguished Service Cross . I asked him what heroic action gained him those decorationsand he grinned . " I got ' cm because I thought I might have some grandchildrensomeday , " he said . " They 'll want to know what I did in the great war for civilization and I 'll show these medals . I 'll have a swell story worked out by that time . I 'll have it worked out that I won the war singlehanded . " " How 'd you really get them ? " I asked . " Different ways , " Thorpe said . " This craw-digger holdingp241up he Croix de Guerre I got from a Frenchman after the Armistice . I traded him a pack of Camel cigarettes for it . This yellow one I got from a redheaded mademoiselle named Veronica . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or another . And she gave it to me for sonic favor or another . But I like the American one best . Anybody could get the French ones for five francs , but the stores did n't have the D.S.C . I had to fight for that . " " How do you mean ? " " Well , I was going down a street in Orleans one night and there was a M.P . military policeman who got God damn cocky . He yells , Leatherneck , get your hands out of those pockets . ' And I tells him where to get off at and one thing led to another and he makes a pass at me and I connect and I land on top of him in the gutter . Well , this M.P . was wearing this Elks Lodge badge , so I took it for a souvenir . " When Thorpe was out at lunch Chapin came around to me and said , " Zig , do n't believe a word that fellow tells you about the war . He was lying about the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in his room having a drink and Harve was feeling pretty high . We were talking about the war and he dug out an official citation and showed me . The citation said Corporal Harvey Thorpe captured a machine gun nest singlehanded and I finally pried out of him how it happened . I forget just where they were , but there was a German machine gun nest about fifty yards away raking their shallow trench . They were having to keep on their hands and knees and even then the machine gun was knocking off somebody every few minutes . " Finally Harve noticed how they were working . The gun would lay bursts into them steady for a while then there would be a lull of about forty-five seconds . Harvey timed the lulls with his watch and figured that was when they were changing belts . He figured , too , that the crew would be occupied in making the change and would n't be paying particularattention to what was going on outside . " He waited for a lull and then jumped out of the trench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jumped down among the Germans with his bayonet . There were six of them there and they all surrendered without an argument . So he took their Luger pistols and turned the machine gun around on the Germans until his leathernecks came on over . " Harve says there was n't any particular danger , because he knew how it would work out . But suppose one of the Germans saw him coming . They all had pistols . And suppose they had n't been sick of the war and ready to surrender . It they 'd put up a fight , what chance would one man with a rifle stand against six with automatics ? " I think Thorpe is almost as old as I am . Anyhow he is grayer . A few nights later I jumped Thorpe privately about his lying and told him he should be proud of his exploit . He was embarrassed but admitted he really was proud in a way . " But , hell , " he said , " there arc enough phonies running around now telling how they won the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under martial law . Armored war tanks are rolling and rumbling through the downtown streets . Bronzed soldiers in steel helmets , veterans of the war , are patrolling everywhere with bayoneted rifles . Mayor Dewey C. Bailey is virtually deposed and ensconced in the mayor 's office is Colonel C. C. Ballou of the regular army , commander of the city . This came about yesterday following three days of virtual civil war . Employees of the Denver Tramway Company called a strike a week ago today . They had asked wage increases from 58 cents an hour to 75 cents an hour , a two weeks ' vacationannually under pay and several other concessions whichp243the company refused to grant . Instead , when it became apparentthat a strike was coming , the streetcar officials engaged John ( " Black Jack " ) Jerome , San Francisco strikebreaker , to come in with a tough crew and keep the cars running . There were no cars running Monday , however , and all Denver either walked to work , caught rides with obliging motorists or rode in jitneys  --  private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passengers for a nickel or a dime . I walked to the Twentieth Street viaduct and caught a ride on a truck . Going to work at noon , there naturally was not much of a crowd . But at 2 o'clock in the morning there were neither obliging motorists nor jitneys and I had to walk clear home . The Call handled the story as it should be handled -- strictly as news without bias . The News and Times expressed some indignation at the inconvenience . The little Express , however , bitterly assailed the company and came out flatfootedly for the employees . And the Post was even more bitter against the men , decrying the fact that a thousand utility workers led by an " outside agitator " could inconvenience a whole city of 300,000 people . The company promised that cars would be running Tuesday and they did run one car through the downtown district . Its windows were covered with steel grating and it was filled with strikebreakers armed with at the controller and the car was escorted on a circle trip through the downtown district by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reason that the police were quick to leap from their cars and arrest anyone who even jeered at the strikebreakers . Trouble really started on Thursday . And before midnight Denver had seen its wildest day in history . The company was making an attempt to resume actual service . Cars with windows so heavily grated that you couldP244see only shadowy outlines of the passengers were hooked together tandem . And each of the tandem cars carried crews of four armed strikebreakers . When I climbed from a jitney at Sixteenth and California streets early Thursday afternoon I saw a commotion down on Fifteenth . People were running down California and 1 joined in the rush . There stalled and surrounded by a crowd of hundreds was one of these two-car trains . There was a great deal of yelling and movement down front and I climbed on top of a refuse can to see over the heads of the crowd . First I saw the grating ripped from the side of the leading car . Then there was a rippling crash and clinkle as stones and paving bricks smashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scabs , kill the scabs ! " Then both streetcars toppled over with a terrible roar and a cloud of dust . Near me two men plowed out of the crowd carrying the inert and bleeding body of another . Then two policemen pushed into California Street supporting slim , old Chief of Police Hamilton Armstrong . Armstrong was capless and was bleeding badly from a wound in his head . He appeared badly dazed . One of the policemen also was bleeding from his nose . Then I went to the office , figuring we should get out an extra on the riot . One of these strikebreakers , it developed , was beaten to death and all of them were badly mauled . The company and Black Jack Jerome , undaunted , made an effort to open service on the East Colfax Avenue line and shortly before 6 o'clock started two trains up Capitol Hill . But by the time they reached the crest there were 5,000 people congregated . The track was blocked and the cars came to a stop at Pennsylvania Street in front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tipped over . Several of the strikebreakers were caught and beaten to unconsciousness . The others fled up the steps of the cathedral , P245followed by the mob . The strikebreakers dashed through the doors as Father William Higgins stepped out . His black robe whipped in the wind . He held up his hand . " You ca n't enter the House of God with violence in your hearts , " he cried . And the mob stopped . They went back down the steps . Then they set fire to the cars . The upset streetcars blazed and smoked and smoldered for hours , melting the asphalt paving , because the fire department could n't break through the mob , could n't even get to fire plugs to attach a hose . Finally the mob left the burning cars . They left in a body , marching down Colfax past the Pioneer Monument and into Fifteenth Street . From somewhere two or three drums had appeared and they marched to their rhythmic rattle . Leading the mob were numerous young men in soldiers ' uniforms . They were either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fitzsimons Hospital . In front was a soldier carrying a large American flag . And he was leading the battle chant that swelled and swelled in volume as they marched . " Let 's get the Post/ Let 's get the Post ! Let 's get the Post ! " That is what they were chanting . In that chant was distilled hate for a commercial institution which harps daily on its own self-styled altruism . " The Denver Post , the paper with a heart and soul . The Denver Post is your big brother . " These are phrases that appearin every issue of the Post . And over the country are billboardspainted a gleaming chrome yellow with this inscription in black : " Yes , the Denver Post is yellow , but it 's shore some pumpkins . " But most of all , the Denver Post had been attackingthis strike with extraordinary bitterness . Probably there were but few actual Tramway employees in this marching , chanting mob . There were huskies from the Denver Rock Drill . There were rough customers from the Burnham shops and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned into Champa and crowded from curb to curb in front of the Post building where no doubt most of them had crowded before to see Houdini wriggle out of a strait-jacket while suspended by the heels ; or an Empress Theater juggler catch a turnip on a fork held in his teeth when Mr. Bonfils threw the turnip from the Post roof ; or to hear prize-fight blow-by-blow announcementsbellowed from a megaphone ; or to receive stiff and bloody jackrabbits killed in drives sponsored by the Post and doled out by the altruistic Mr. Bonfils and Mr. Tammen , The street lights gleamed dully on the broad golden inscriptionacross the front of the building :  --  " O , Justice , When Expelled From Other Habitations , Make This Thy Dwelling Place ! " And a half-pound locomotive nut hurled by a Burnham shopman crashed terrifically through one of the huge plateglasswindows . In an instant stones and bricks and scrap iron carried by the mob were showering through all the windows  --  even those on the third floor . From some source the soldier with the flag had obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around his shoulders like a toga , shouted for a following and charged his plank into the front door like a battering ram . The door gave way and the cheering , howling mob followed him into the business office . They tore down iron grillings . They ripped up a drinking fountain so water geysered up , flooding the floor . They smashed desks , wrecked typewriters , pounded cash registers to pieces . On the second floor the emergency night crew of the editorialstall fled across the areaway into the Symes Building and thence down into Sixteenth Street . On the third floor the night crew of linotype operators turned off their machines and fled also down into the Symes Building . The mob spread out . Some of them found their way to the basement and the big presses which most of them probably had watched with awe from the Champa Street windows . P247They hacked at the rollers with axes . They poured printer 's ink over everything . One of them found he could start a smaller press by pushing a button , so they fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cylinder and then blew a fuse , stopping the machine . They started a fire , but water gushing down from the broken pipe extinguished it . In the editorial rooms they upset desks and threw typewriters . They wrecked the furniture in Bonfils ' " Red Room . " They broke the glass case which held Tamen 's stuffed baby elephant , the former prize exhibit of Sells-Floto circus , which the Post owns , and made away with the elephant . They went through the morgue like a whirlwind , dumping out the contentsof all the files and ruining whatever they could , destroyingthe librarian 's work of years . Up in the composing room they did little damage outside of upsetting a few linotypes . With a hammer they could have disabled every machine for days merely by battering the matrix-distributing bar , but they apparently did not know this . But in spite of all this , the Post came out as usual the next day . City Editor A. K. Stone moved clown to the police reporters ' room at police headquarters where it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12-point type because the upset linotypes were mostly body type machines . But in this case the Post no doubt would have set the major part of the paper in big type anyhow . The lead story was written by Bruce Gustin , a mild-manneredblond fellow of about my size . And his lead , set in fullface 14 point , read : Hell broke loose in Denver Thursday . When they left the Post the mob somehow pushed two gigantic rolls of paper out in the street and unrolled them all over town . The streets were cluttered with miles of newsprint . Another mob later engaged in a battle at the South Denver carbarns where strikebreakers were billeted . When they began throwing stones as well as taunts at Jerome 's men , the strikebreakersopened fire and wounded two of the crowd seriously . Friday morning Mayor Bailey announced that police were unable to cope with the situation and asked for 2,000 volunteersfrom ex-service men to help preserve order . He did not wish to ask for the National Guard because intense bitterness against the state militia still exists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feared that if the militia were called out it might cause bloodshed rather than prevent it . The ex-soldiers responded . They were armed with pick handles and arm brassards and were put to directing traffic . That evening came the worst riot of all . Bill Cunningham had reporters stationed at all the danger points and at the hospitals . Our composing room deadline for the first street edition is 8:4o p.m . And about 8:2o Cunningham began to get calls from people on the East Side . " What 's the shooting about ? " they asked . And , " We just heard police sirens going by here . Is there any trouble ? " Cunningham did n't know and was pretty unhappy about it . From the location of the calls he assumed something might have happened at the East Side carbarns at East Thirty-fifth Avenue and Gilpin Street . But he had a young reporter named Simpson stationed there and he had heard nothing from him . O'Brien , tired out from the strain of the last 24 hours , had gone out to lunch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some kind of hell was popping out east , but he did n't know what . " Well , " I said , " you better get it unpopped pretty soon because we 've got to go to press . " Cunningham got hold of another reporter and sent him to Thirty-fifth and Gilpin in a taxi . Minutes went by andP249people kept calling in wanting to know what the shooting was about and still no report from Simpson . Then at 8:35 Simpson called . " I 've got the names of some of the dead and wounded , " he said . " For God 's sake , man , what 's happened ? " demanded Bill . " Well , " said the cub , " you know I phoned you at eight o'clock that there was an orderly crowd of two or three hundred out here . Well , they were n't doing a thing . Just standing . There were men and women and children . Just standing . " " But what happened ? " Cunningham 's voice was a scream . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Simpson . " They drove up to the crowd . And they had rifles and shotguns . First they fired a volley in the air . I was right there close and saw it all . The crowd backed up a little . Then the American Legion fired right into the crowd . I do n't know how many they killed yet . The ground was covered with bodies of dead and wounded . Men , women and children . " " Great God , Simpson , " said Cunningham , " be sure what you 're saying . Are you certain they were American Legion men ? And how are you sure ? " " I was as close as from here to that counter , " declared Simpson . " Well , of course you ca n't see the counter . I 'm in a drugstore . But I was close and I saw their arm bands and everything . " So Cunningham could do nothing but take Simpson 's word and started hammering out the story himself , sending it paragraph by paragraph over to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the composing room foreman , came fuming up the stairs yelling , " Where in hell 's your eight-column line ? Where in hell 's your lead story ? What in hell 's wrong up here ? Have n't I got enough trouble downstairs without having to wet-nurse the God-damn editorial department , tool ' We ought to be going off the floor now , God damn it . "   I was trying to rush out two 8-column , I20-point lines that would tell the story and still protect us . Then the lights went out . Hewtn let out a scream that could he heard two blocks . " Now look at that . The God-damn power 's off , The Goddamnmachines are on . " And Harvey Thorpe lit a match and held it so 1 could see what I was writing . And Hewitt said , " Let me have your God-damn lines . Those are set by hand , anyhow ' . " I said , " Just a second . " And the copy desk phone rang and Frank Chapin answered it and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone . thinking perhaps it was Gotchell just as Cunninghamshouted over , " Wait a minute , Zig , Joe West is calling . Maybe something important . " And Hewitt howled , " Ai n't got any God-damn minute to wait , important or not important . What the hell . " And i said " Hello " into the transmitter . It was Pearl . She said , " Homer , our lights are off and we 're playing bridge . You know what 's wrong ? " I said , " Will you go to hell with your God-damned bridge ? " and slammed up the receiver . And Cunningham yelled , " For Christ 's sake do n't let that story get away . Kill it , kill it ! " Hewitt yelled hack , " What the hell 's wrong now ? " " That story 's wrong . " Then the lights came on , but Hewitt did n't notice . " Everything , " he said , " that the editorial department does is wrong . We 're late right this minute and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we never get the God-damn paper out . " Then he stalked hack downstairs . Well , we finally got the paper out about fifteen minutes late . And what really had happened as Joe West reported accurately was this : an automobile taking Black Jack Jerome and his guard out to the East Side carbarns for an inspection was halted by the crowd . Someone recognized Jerome and threw a brick through the windshield . The men in the car , P251trying to frighten the crowd back , fired into the air . But the strikebreakers in the carbarn thought Jerome was being fired on by the crowd and poured a volley from rifles and revolvers into the strike sympathizers. hour were killed and thirteen wounded . Young Simpson was simply so frightened he did n't know what he had seen . It was a miracle that we did n't put the paper out blaming the American Legion for the massacre . It would have meant the jobs of Simpson , Cunningham and myself and very likely a boycott of the Call . It is very dangerous to say anything bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The East Side carbarn massacre brought the call for federal troops . Colonel Ballou came up from Fort Logan with his men and the veteran Second Division troops were rushed up from Camp Funston , Kansas . Things quieted immediately after their arrival . Streetcars are running with soldier guards . I understand , however , that the troops , who are quartered in the Municipal Auditorium , grumble a lot over strike duty . Pearl is still mad at me for swearing at her over the telephone . She scarcely will speak to me . This afternoon she took Byron and left the house without saying where she was going . Byron told me this evening that they went to the Tabor and saw Mary Pickford in " Pollyanna . " He did n't care so much for the picture but liked the animated cartoon of Andy Gump . I apologized to Pearl and tried to explain how it was . I do n't believe she 's really so mad . I believe she is merely trying to teach me a lesson . Well , I can stand Pearl 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a way her " punishment " is sort of a relief . NOVEMBER 7 , 1920 . After the quietest presidential campaign I have ever seen , Warren G. Harding , United States senator from Ohio , was elected Tuesday over his Democratic opponent , Governor James M. Cox , also of Ohio . I believe everyP252copyreader in the country was hoping for Cox 's election . His name fits into a head so well . And above that I hoped for his election because he was the champion of Wilson 's principles . Poor Wilson , broken from his own desperate battle to save the League of Nations , has been an invalid or semi-invalid since he collapsed following a speech at Pueblo a year ago . I am convinced that Cox is a much abler man than Harding , but public reaction to the present state of affairs was too much for him . Prices have been skyrocketing . There is much unemployment . And there is an overwhelming desire to break away from all things connected with the war . I did have hopes for Cox 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or perhaps because of ) the campaign for the League of Nations , his defeat was inevitable . The voters , and especially the women who cast their first ballots Tuesday , want to pull away from all things European . Harding called for a " return to normalcy , " probably meaningnormality , and the people wanted " normalcy " bad enough to give him a landslide victory . His vice-president is a sourfaced , taciturn , former governor of Massachusetts named Calvin Coolidge , who attained some prominence last year by calling out the National Guard when police struck in Boston . If he had called for federal troops as did Mayor Bailey here , I suppose he would be President now instead of Harding . Cox 's running mate was Franklin D. Roosevelt , a vigorous young man , Assistant Secretary of the Navy in this administration . He made some very good campaign speeches as , in fact , did Cox . Harding limited himself to " front porch talks " from his home in Marion , Ohio , where he runs a newspaper . Harding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has distinctive , bushy black eyebrows . No doubt he is a good man . He does , however , seem somewhat confused and not quite confident . Tuesday night when it became apparenthe was elected his statement to the press was not one of thanks to the voters nor of elation that now he should beP253able to undertake his program . He said , " I pray God to make me capable of playing my part . " No doubt that also should be the nation 's prayer . Pearl has allowed Byron to stop taking his piano lessons . I thought he was progressing satisfactorily , but she says she had a battle with him every day to force him to practice and that if he does n't care enough for music to want to practice there is no use spending money for his lessons . I suppose there is something to that , but I did want him to learn the piano . Perhaps he will take it up again when he is a little older . I wish , however , I had got my way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as they have at the Press Club . I enjoy pumping the rolls through and we could have some music . Pearl says she detests player pianos . But our piano now is just a piece of furniture  --  and it is n't paid for yet , either . A 3o-hour search for an air-mail pilot lost between Salt Lake City and Cheyenne ended last night when they found the wrecked De Haviland near Tie Siding , just across the Wyoming line on the Laramie road . The pilot , John P. Woodward , who apparently had become lost in a storm , was crushed to death in the wreckage . JUNE 19 , 1921 . Pearl and Byron are in Kansas City visiting her mother . Byron is io years old now and , although he is not large for his age , I had to buy a half-fare ticket for him . Byron is developing into a very bright boy with an inquiring mind . He does well in school , especially in arithmetic . He is eternally asking questions which leave Pearl and me at a loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Book of Knowledge from a house-to-house salesman , which we are paying for on the installment plan . They are quite expensive , but Byron is showing such an interest in looking up things that I amP254sure they are worth many times the cost . I believe the boy probably will develop into a scientist . I am getting my vacation in the middle of July . Pearl and Byron will be home by that time . We have had a very wet spring with disastrous floods . Pueblo was virtually destroyed by a flood on June 4 when cloudbursts ripped out reservoirs in the upper reaches of the Arkansas River . A wall of water swept down on the city taking everything before it . Loss of life is estimated at 500 although no one will ever know the exact toll . Peppersauce Bottoms , a congested Mexican district , was swept clean . Houses , bodies and everything were taken down the river . We had night and day work for three days during this period , for more floods were in prospect and Pueblo , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every availableman was sent down from the Call  --  even Thorpe off the copy desk , leaving us shorthanded . As no trains were running they had to go by taxicab , and as all highway bridges were out , they had to drive over the railroad tracks , bumping thirty miles or so over the ties . Because all the hotels were underwater except the Congress and the Congress was filled up , even to all the chairs in the lobby , the boys had no place to sleep except where they could find a dry space and very little to eat . I am glad my reporting days are over . JANUARY 29 , 1922 . An unusually heavy snow in Washington caved in the roof of the Knickerbocker Theater there last night . At least 100 persons were crushed to death . The wires handled this story very poorly . Not only were they inexcusably slow , but their facts were contradictory and the stories were as poorly written as you would expect from the rawest cub police reporter . This impressed me as strange , inasmuch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in Washington . To beP255sent to Washington is counted a great honor and the greatest promotion possible for a newspaper writing man . I suppose , however , that reporters go to seed in the capital . They are so accustomed to receive their news on a platter in the form of " handouts " from the various governmental departments that they have forgotten how to dig out facts on their own initiative . And confronted with a major disaster , they all blew up . Bootlegging now is very pronounced in Denver . There are several bootleggers who " deal off the hip " in the vicinity of the Call building . Some of them make regular trips to the editorial room . Others " hang out " in the poolroom down the block . They sell whisky made from beet sugar at $ ; a pint The price is scandalous , but the whisky is worse . It is impossible for me to drink it without a quick chaser of water . I have read two impressive new books this winter --  " Three Soldiers " by John Dos Passos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " If Winter Comes " by A. S. M. Hutchinson , an Englishman . I read " Three Soldiers " first . And I believe that was a mistake . I 'm afraid it hurt my perspective for " If Winter Comes , " which probably is a much better book than Passos ' . As it was , the raw , blasphemous vigor of " Three Soldiers " made the character of Mark Sabre in Hutchinson 's book seem a little too lovable . It was like eating a sugary French pastry on top of a healthy slug of moonshine whisky . It would seem that somewhere between these two distinctivebooks would be the proper level for a truly great novel . Bill Cunningham , for years city editor of the Call , has taken a job with an advertising firm in St. Louis . Boyd Ferguson is the new city editor . Boyd gave a party at his house in celebration two or three weeks ago and both he and I and several others got fairly well lit on moonshine mixed with ginger ale . The ginger ale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . P256AUGUST 6 , 1922 . For once I managed to save out enough money for a vacation by myself . I announced firmly that I needed to get away , that I was going into the mountains by myself so I could think and regain my perspective . Pearl was somewhat sarcastic , but offered no violent objections . I planned out the whole project in detail . I bought some army breeches at the Army and Navy store and a pair of laced boots . In that costume I would leave home , but instead of taking a train for the hills , I would take the Union Pacific through Wyoming into Utah . My vacation starts today . For a month I have been counting the days until tomorrow , when I could take the morning train . All week I have been excited over the prospect , as excited as a child during the week before Christmas . But Friday night I had a dream . Frances was on a train . I saw her sitting in a Pullman looking dreamily out the window while a landscape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by . That was most disturbing . If Frances were on a long trip , naturally there was no sense of me going to Raleigh , Utah . From the landscape I judged she probably was on her way back to Buffalo . But still , many parts of California have trees and fields and rolling hills . And even the landscape in the valley close to Salt Lake City might be mistaken for the Middle West . But it was all settled last night . I saw Frances in her old home on Lemon Street , Buffalo . She was with her mother in the kitchen , wiping dishes while her mother washed them . Mrs. Harbach seemed much older . But Frances looks little different than when I last saw her sixteen long years ago . They were talking , but their conversation meant little to me . It was almost as if they were speaking in German and I could understand a word here and there but not quite enough to catch the sense . P257Finally Mrs. Harbach said , " Wait a minute , honey , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and poured hot water over the dishes on the draining board . Mrs. Harbach put the teakettle back on the stove and said , " Did you know Mrs. Zigler was back visiting Ethel this spring ? " Frances started . " Oh , " she said , " how is she ? " " I did n't see her , " Mrs. Harbach explained . " Ethel lives in Kenmore , but Mrs. Zigler was over here to church . I did n't go that day , but Mrs. Seifert was telling me about meeting her . She looked fine , Mrs. Seifert said , and Mr. Zigler is doing so well down in Pittsburgh . " " Did she say anything about Homer ? " Fran 's voice sounded queer . " Mrs. Seifert said he 's way out west in Denver or some place working on a newspaper and doing fine . " " He was in Kansas City , " said Frances . She was wiping a long time on a dinner plate . " No , it was n't Kansas City , " insisted Mrs. Harbach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then the dream changed to something irrelevant . I wish I had enough money to go back to Pittsburgh on my vacation and see Mother . Last winter she wrote she was suffering from sciatica in her hip , but she got over that with the coming of summer . If I could go back to Pittsburgh I could run up to Buffalo and probably see Frances before she left . But I have n't enough money and I do n't know where I could get it without going to a loan shark and I 'm afraid of starting that . So I shall take the sort of vacation Pearl thought I was going to take in the first place , although it does n't appeal to me much . I have Sherwood Anderson 's " Poor White " to read while vacationing . I have only started it , but find it gripping .   NOVEMBER 12 , 1922 . Pearl has become a disciple of Emile Coue , the French country town druggist who has developed a health system called " Self-Mastery by Autosuggestion . " Thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going around saying , " Every day in every way I grow better and better . " It is something like faith healing and something like Christian Science only there is no religion connected with it . There is nothing particularly wrong with Pearl except that she has been putting on weight . She has tried dieting , but did n't like that . So now she has a string with ten knots tied in it and she says this " rosary " every morning and every night , repeating ten times , " Every day in every way I grow thinner and thinner . " For the last year there has been virtually a civil war in some sections of Italy . Italian Socialists , who were opposed to the World War , refused to fight . They stayed at home and dug themselves in . As a result the red labor unions gained control of factories and many farms . We have had stories about the red flag and the scythe and hammer of Bolshevist Russia being in evidence everywhere and a Socialist bloc in Parliament virtually paralyzed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Communist minority would subdue the nation as it did in Russia . Then Benito Mussolini came to the front . Mussolini is a highly educated and widely traveled member of the Italian aristocracy who once was a Socialist , but who sympathized so strongly with the Allied cause that he enlisted as a private soldier and was wounded a hundred times at the front . After the war Mussolini formed an organization of war veterans something like the American Legion called the " Fasci di Combattimento , " or the " Fasces of Combat . " And as the red terrorists grew more bold the war veterans began to meet the peril with armed resistance . With pistols and clubs and grenades the patriots drove the reds from the factories and restored the mills to their rightful owners . Theyp259burned red newspapers and broke the power of trade unions on the farms . The principle which the " Fascisti " arc fighting for and the battle cry of Mussolini is , " The state is made for man , not man for the state . " Two weeks ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerless in the clutches of red destructionists , Mussolini at the head of his veterans marched into Rome . It was practically a revolution , a bloodless revolution . King Victor welcomed " I1 Duce , " as Mussolini is called , to Rome and invited him to form a cabinet . Mussolini formed the cabinet and showed his fairness by including representatives of other parties . Some commentators believe Mussolini can form a dictatorshipin Italy under the sanction of the King , but most observersin Italy who know Mussolini doubt if he will do so . The correspondent for the Christian Science Monitor , for instance , declares he knows Mussolini will not take undue power for himself , attesting that " the striking characteristic of Premier Mussolini is lack of personal ambition . " The Premier 's first step in straightening out the sorry postwarmess into which Italy has fallen was to begin disbanding the costly Italian army . It is the consensus of experts and observers that Mussolini is too much of an idealist to last long as Premier of troubled Italy . But he may sow enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work good for his nation and for the world . More often than not idealists fail to see their epochmakingideas succeed . Honor comes to the martyrs of great causes usually after their deaths . SEPTEMBER 9 , 1923 . I have been news editor of the Call fornearly a month . My promotion came after a row with Harvey O'Brien in which Fred Gotchell took my part and O'Brien quit his job . He has gone to Los Angeles . P260On August 2 President Harding died in San Francisco . For clays there was nothing else in the papers while they were taking his body across the continent to Washington and while he lay in state at the Capitol . The whole nation was in a state bordering on hysteria of grief . The newspapers and wire servicesworked themselves into such a frenzy that one might have judged America was doomed to disintegration now that its great leader was gone . Harding no doubt was a good man and a reasonably competent President  --  for a Republican . But , if one could judge from the millions of words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a far greater man than Lincoln or Washington , to say nothing of Wilson . Kirke Simpson , the A.P . ' s star Washington man , who gained fame and the Pulitzer award for his " Unknown Soldier " piece , wrote the Unknown Soldier all over again for Harding . And every other writer on the job tried to show that he knew at least as many solemn adjectives as Simpson . So when it came time for them to move Harding 's body from Washington to the Marion , Ohio , burial ground , there was n't much left to say  --  especially in 8-column lines . I worried out a line myself for the home edition which read , " WARREN HARDING GOES HOME FOREVER . " O'Brien was in the composing room when he saw the line in proof . He came upstairs . " Who wrote that line ? " he demanded . I admitted authorship . " For Christ 's sake , " O'Brien said . " A man to sit in the slot of a copy desk should know enough to stop any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writes it himself , there 's no hope for him . Here , Thorpe , write an eight-column eighty-four saying something to the effect that Harding 's body is taken to Marion . " That made me mad . " Listen here , O'Brien , " I said , " while I 'm head of this desk I 'm giving the orders to copyreaders . If you do n't like this line we 'll change it . But I 'll have itP261changed and I 'll have it changed by whomever I want to change it . " O'Brien started to say something , then quieted down . " All right , " he said , " have it changed then . " " First tell me what you do n't like about it . " I was standing up and talking right into his face . " I do n't like any part of it , " he said . " It 's a lousy head . It does n't say anything . Warren Harding Goes 1lome Forever . In the first place , a corpse ca n't go anywhere ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where is home ? In the third place , everybody knows who Harding is by this time and Warren is superfluous padding as well as being practically disrespectful . And in the fourth place , the forever is unconfirmed and superfluous . " " All right , " I said . " You 're news editor and I 'll change the line myself . " So I wrote , " HARDING 'S BODY TAKEN TO MARION " and sent it down . In twenty minutes or so Gotchell came in and went into his office . In a little while he came out with his face beaming . He was carrying a proof of the first line I wrote . He held up " WARREN HARDING GOES HOME FOREVER . " " That 's a swell line , Zig , " he said . " Who wrote it ? " " I wrote it , " I said , " but it 's not going in the paper . " " Why not ? " Gotchell chewed his cigar and squinted his eyes . " O'Brien killed it . Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line say ? " " Harding 's Body Taken to Marion . " " Oh , hell ! Hey , Harve . " O'Brien was up from his desk and his face was white . " Why change that line , Harve ? " asked Gotchell . " It 's got everything . It 's practically poetry . " " Poetry 's got no place in an eight-column line , " said O'Brien . " Why , " declared Gotchell , " that line tells the whole story . It tells everything . Every paper in the country will have Harding'sbody taken to Marion . Just trite tripe . Here , Harvey , put this line back . " " Mr. Gotchell , " said O'Brien . His voice was quivering . " You put that line back on the paper and you 'll have to get a new news editor . " " That 's entirely up to you , Harvey , " said Gotchell . " I 'm giving you notice then , " said O'Brien . " I 'm through . " So I was put on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like this job better than the other . There is more responsibility , but not the rush . And besides , my pay was raised to $6o a week with promise of more . It is pretty lucky for me all the way round . If Bill Cunningham had n't left when he did he would have become news editor instead of me without a question . I feel now I am getting somewhere . News editor is only one step from managing editor . And $6o a week is not a bad salary anywhere . Now I shall be able to save some money . My vacation was scheduled for the middle of August , but I waived it because of the promotion . Pearl , Byron and I went to " The Covered Wagon " tonight . It was a great picture with marvelous photography and stirringscenes of the westward march of the empire . It made me think of my own novel and it made me wonder when I shall ever have time to write it . I have even less time to myself as news editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk . I really feel that I should drop in the office and look over proofs on my night off . Byron is starting in the seventh grade at Skinner Junior High School this fall and is doing fine . This afternoon I was sitting in the living room reading the Literary Digest when he spoke up in his oddly drawling voice . " Dad , " he said , " what 's the capital of Australia ? " " Canberra , " I said , without looking up .   " That 's right , Dad , " he said , " I thought you 'd probably sayMelbourne . " He was n't looking for information at all . Just trying to trap ( his old papa . JULY 26 , 1925 . I dropped into the office this warm Sunday afternoon to see how Harvey Thorpe was coming with preparations for a baseball extra . I had eaten a big Sunday dinner at home of roast pork and had a touch of indigestion . In my desk I keep a can of bicarbonate of soda , a glass and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass and was going to the water cooler for some water when the Associated Press boybrought in a flash . William J. Bryan dead . I had to go backto my desk and sit down . Until that moment I had not really appreciated how much the Great Commoner meant to me . For three weeks , however , I had been conscious that Bryan was getting old . All during the " monkey trial " in Dayton , Tenn. , the proceedings had been very painful to me for Bryan , in his sublime and literal faith in the Bible , had permitted the cunning Clarence Darrow to trap him time after time in ridiculous statements . Bryan was never one to compromise . He would not compromiseeven with President Wilson . He resigned as Secretary of State rather than give in one inch on the stand he believed was right concerning notes to Germany . And history perhaps will show that he was right in this instance . At Dayton it was different . Bryan was no scientist . He was a humanitarian and a Christian . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incapable of rationalizing Biblical tales with science . It was a very sad spectacle . Bryan of the " Cross of Gold " speech ; Bryan the former idol of millions ; Bryan , who , virtually singlehanded defeated Champ Clark at Baltimore and elected Woodrow Wilson President  --  being made a monkey of by a criminal lawyer . And then he died . Three times defeated for President and then last year patronized at the New York convention which battled back and forth for more than a hundred ballots betweenAlfred E. Smith and William Gibbs McAdoo before compromising on the J. P. Morgan man , John W. Davis . Probably the Great Commoner died in the belief that he was a failure . But he was not a failure . He failed many times , but there was a sublimity in his failing . He had a profound influence on America and on the world . I have been neglecting this record for more than a year . But as a matter of fact there has been little for me to record . I have read virtually no fiction . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my job . Certainly I have thought none at all about writing a novel . This spring after my pay was raised to $70 a week we moved to a larger house on Federal Boulevard . Pearl was set for a while on moving away from North Denver . She felt that the prestige of a news editor would not be helped by the fact that his residence was listed on the North Side . She felt it would be more fitting for us to live in Park Hill . Byron , however , wanted to stay in North Denver . He will be in the ninth grade this fall and go to North Denver High next year . His friends are here and he did n't want to leave them . Especially , there is a gangling , sleepy-eyed youth named Wallace French with whom he chases butterflies and studies birds and concocts vile-smelling chemical compounds in a laboratory the boys have set up in Byron 's room . Byron is the most interesting 14-year-old boy I ever saw . He has a strangely blase and adult manner and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he has developed great self-assurance . He is a lad who is marked for success in whateverlines he enters . Really he studies his school lessons very little , being more interested in affairs far beyond his years , but nevertheless he manages to keep well up in his class with a minimum of effort . Sometimes of an evening when Wallace French and ByronP265come downtown to attend a lecture or go to a movie they will drop into the office and pay me a dignified visit and borrow a dollar on Byron 's next week 's allowance . Last Wednesday was typical . Byron sat down at the edge of my desk and picked up a copy of the first street edition . He read the " scream line "  --  " SIX DIE AS TRAIN HITS AUTO . " He pursed his lips . " Hmmm , down in Tennessee , " he said . " Dad , any of these people known in Denver ? " " Not that I know of , Son , " I said . " Why , then , is this accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I could n't help laughing . The boy had hit one of our sins squarely on the head . Byron leaned back in his chair and put one of his shoes on my desk . He looked over the page and frowned . " I should think , " he said in a manner strikingly like some dignified managing editor , " that this story on the Washington Arms Conference should be regarded the most important news . " I explained to the best of my ability that we doubtless would use that arms conference story for the lead in the home edition . I explained that he was reading the first street edition and that the circulation department demands lots of gore in street editions so they can sell papers . Byron still frowned . " But , Dad , " he said , " that sc : t of thing is essentially dishonest . With a big line like that , Six Die as Train Hits Auto , ' you 're implying the accident was in Denver . People will buy the paper and then feel cheated when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh and tell him we never had any corn , plaints on that score and that , after all , putting out a newspaperis a commercial enterprise . You 've got to have exciting lines in a street edition to sell papers . You 've got to sell papers to get circulation . You 've got to have circulation to sell advertising . But of course Byron was right , dead right . And such266 " ' 1 ' 11E GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL --  "  |p266insight  and reasoning on the part of a 14-year-old boy impressesme as remarkable . I doubt whether more than a few of our reporters could analyze this fault of newspaper publishingas surely and succinctly as did Byron . At last we are going to have an automobile . Pearl and Byron have been arguing for a year and finally I have become convinced a family misses a lot of life without a car in this modern age . They have been building many improved roads through the mountains and it would be possible for us to take some wonderful drives on my day off . So we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last Monday I paid $350 down on an Essex coach . I expect to get delivery this week . I had favored a Ford as being more simple to operate and cheaper both to buy and to operate , but Pearl and Byron are prejudiced against flivvers . The Essex seems to be a very fine car . They claim you can drive it 50 miles an hour all day long . Of course we never will drive that fast at any time . Speed is what causes accidents . I shall lay down a set rule that the car never must be driven more than 35 miles an hour . Both Pearl and Byron are wild to learn to drive . But I do not anticipate any great degree of pleasure until I have masteredthe machine . I shall , however , go at the matter in a scientific manner . I shall paint a white mark in the exact center of each front mudguard . Likewise , I shall paint a white stripe down the center of each front tire . Then in driving I can keep the tire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am holding the automobile exactly true . That device should help all of us . FEBRUARY 14 , 1926 . It has been a bright Colorado winter Sunday . But my spirit is sodden with grief . Since Thursday night I have been wandering about in a daze , doing my work automatically . P267Tonight I sat here and thought over my life and I remembered that this was Valentine 's Day . I remembered back twenty years  --  my first year on the old Buffalo Morning Journal  --  when I took Frances a huge box of candy in the shape of a red heart and that the next night was my night off and how we popped corn and ate it with the candy . A week ago this morning I had a particularly vivid dream of Frances . She was out with Clark in an old Ford touring car on an isolated road . The road was covered with snow and there was snow in the air . Presently the car stalled . Clark got out and cranked and cranked but could n't get the engine started . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving Frances . She sat in the open car for a while and then got out and paced back and forth in the snow . She slapped her hands to warm them . She stamped her feet . Then she got back in the car and wrapped herself up in a robe . When Clark finally got back with a rancher in another car Frances was so chilled she scarcely could talk . Had she been in a coach like ours , she could have kept comparatively warm with all the windows closed , but in this touring car she would have needed arctic furs to keep comfortable . As a result she was ill before they reached home . I worried about her until Thursday . Then came one of the most vivid dreams I ever had . Frances was very ill in bed . She was gasping desperately for breath and the bearded doctor by the bedside said to a middle-aged woman , apparently a practical nurse , " God , if I only had some oxygen . And there 's none closer than Ogden . " Frances coughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a towel . Then Clark came in with a priest and the priest knelt by the bedside praying . Then he administered extreme unction . And when he anointed her eyes , saying , " By this holy unction and through Hi3 most tender mercy , may the Lord forgiveP268thee whatsoever sin thou hast committed by sight , " Frances opened her beautiful blue eyes that once I was privileged to kiss and she spoke softly , " Homer ! " " The poor dear 's delirious , " said the nurse . " She 's calling her mother . " Then Frances closed her eyes again and the dream snapped off as a motion picture stops when the film breaks . Then I awoke realizing I never would see her again . How many times I have planned and hoped for the day when I might go to her , when I might talk to her again , even for a few minutes . But Fate had decreed that should never be so , Always there was something which interfered . Once I was starting for Raleigh , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buffalo . It is all so strange . Actually I know nothing of Frances since I left Kansas City and stopped writing to her . That was before Byron was born . That was before she was married . I suppose most people would believe me mad to put such faith in my dreams . Perhaps I am mad . But they have seemed as real as my real life  --  in some instances more real . A practical person could say , " Why , man , for all you know Frances is still living in Buffalo . The business of her marryingPaul Clark , the birth and death of little Carol , the life in Raleigh , Utah , the visit back in Buffalo and now this last sad chapter arc all inventions of your perfervid dream mind . " But that person would discount altogether the matter of telepathy , which was well proved by the fact that we answered each other 's questions in letters before we received the questions . I have wondered so often whether she had equally vivid dreams of me . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But now I shall never know . True , I have never seen Frances in nearly twenty years . No doubt I am a sentimental middle-aged fool , but now thatP269she is gone life seems an empty thing and not worth while , except that I have my duty to Byron  --  and of ' course to Pearl . I censure myself for my silly blunders in the past , especially for my insane flight from Buffalo in 1906 . But no one ever wrote a truer sentence than Omar when he said : The Moving Finger writes ; and , having writ , Moves on : nor all your Piety nor WitShall lure it back to cancel half a line , Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it . I say if I had but controlled my outrageous jealousies then , Frances might be well and happy now . But then I was so unstable emotionally that I could not control myself . Can I censure myself for my own chemical make-up ? The fact that the elements which make up Homer Zigler respond a certain way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvey Thorpe , for instance , respond in another way to the same stimulus is beyond the control of Harvey Thorpe and Homer Zigler . I tell myself I might as well curse a bottle of milk for souring when I add a tablespoon of vinegar . Then , what can I know of Fate ? Apparently Fate decreed that I should love Frances Harbach all my life , but that we never should marry . It was ordained that I should love her for twenty years in silence . Now it is ordained that I shall mourn her in silence for the rest of my life . MAY 22 , 1927 . I am very much annoyed at Pearl . Last night she attended a party at the Franks ' a couple of blocks up Federal and when the party was becoming dry about 11:30 she volunteered to drive a young dentist named Blumberg downtown after some liquor . Coming back ( and probably driving too fast ) she crashed into another car at Osage Street after turning off the Twentieth Street viaduct . Of course there happened to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the gallon jug of moonshine in the back of the car . Fortunately no one was injured , but both cars were badly damaged . When they smelled liquor on Pearl 's breath they literally " threw the book " at her . They took her and Blumberg down to headquarters and charged her with reckless driving , operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of liquor and possessing and transporting intoxicating liquor in violation of the state prohibition law . Joe Moley , our police reporter , phoned me about midnight and told me I had better come down and see if I could help straighten things out . So I got Fred Gotchell and went down in a taxi . They had Pearl locked up in the matron 's quarters , Blumbergin the bull pen and they had dragged our car down and impounded it . Under the law they can confiscate any car that is used to transport liquor . Fred Gotchell and I fixed things up with the chief and got Pearl 's and Blumberg 's names scratched off the blotter . They released our car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I had to promise to pay all damages to the other car to prevent any flareback , so I went to see the other driver , a man named Schmidt who has a fish stall in the City Market , and told him to have his old Maxwell repaired and send me the bill . Our car would n't run so I had it towed from the city pound by Tom Botterill 's garage . I do n't know yet what the two repair bills will be , but it certainly was an expensive party . Perhaps Pcarl was under the influence of liquor when she had the accident , but she was certainly sober when the matron unlocked the door for her to come out  --  sober and tearful . Her main worry was fear that Byron would learn of his mother 's being locked up . There is little danger of that , however . I gave Chuck Kelley , the Rocky Mountain News police reporter , a pint of moonshine not to report it to hisP271paper . I also told him we 'd been watching his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times wo n't find out about it because the names were scratched from the blotter . Pearl was inclined , as usual , to place some of the blame on me . She said if I had got the brakes adjusted last week she could have avoided the collision . I told her if she had n't gone to a stew party and been chasing around town after liquor with a hot-eyed young Jew there would n't have been any collision either . The party was celebrating the safe arrival in France of a young aviator named Charles A. Lindbergh , who hopped off from New York Friday morning and landed in Paris yesterday afternoon after 33 hours of flight . Of course he is not the first flier to cross the Atlantic , but he is the first to do it alone and there was tremendous excitement over his feat . He is a gawky-looking country boy and he inspires the public 's imagination . In a way he is the Great American Fairy Tale come true  --  the shy lad from the farm who took a big chance and won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonstop flight from New York to Paris and says he is going to buy a garage in St. Louis , his home town . Well , the publicity will help his garage business for six months or so until the people forget . But if he is a good mechanic his business should be well established by then . This single flight may well have made him a success for life . I recently have formed a very inspiring friendship . For the last year or so our Sunday book page has been edited by a young widow named Syra Morris . Perhaps I should not say young as Mrs. Morris is , I should say , 36 or 38 , but at least she has the buoyancy and vivacity and charm of youth . She is slim and mahogany-haired and her eyes are a dark sparkling blue . Review copies of books come to her from the publishers . She reads the important ones herself and reviews them , others she " farms out " to members of the staff . P272On Thursday evenings she comes in for a conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the " art " she has selected for the page . Several weeks ago she was late coming in and I met her on the stairs as I was going out for lunch . So I invited her to go to the restaurant with me and hold our weekly conferenceover a cup of coffee . Before this happy occasion I always had regarded Mrs. Morris as just another member of the staff like Mildred Sommers , the society editor , and crochety Wilma Spence , the club editor . But at the Edelweiss Restaurant I discovered what a remarkable person she really is . While in her teens she became an actress and mounted virtually to the top of her profession . She played in Belasco productions on the road and appeared with Ethel Barrymore and Jane Cowl . During the war she married a young officer . He was gassed and they came to Denver for him to receive treatment at Fitzsimons General Army Hospital . He died three or four years ago . Syra was too long away from the stage to return , so , as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denver . Now she is trying to become a magazine writer . She hopes to write for Atlantic Monthly and Scribner 's and Harper 's , but thus far her success has been confined to several minor works sold to Ranch Romances . She gets $10 a week for editing our Sunday book page . Mrs. Morris is the most widely-read person I ever knew . Not only does she know all the contemporary books worth while , but she is well versed in the classics , having attended Vassar before she went on the stage . She has lent me Theodore Dreiser 's " An American Tragedy " which I have wanted to read for a year but could n't afford to spend the $5 the two-volume novel costs . I now am just in the middle of the murder trial , but I should say it is not only Dreiser 's greatest achievement , butP273without a doubt one of the outstanding achievements of the century . Many gifted writers start to work on ideas that would make great books , but spoil the effect with a certain flippancy that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticism of " The Green Hat " by Michael Arlen and of F. Scott Fitzgerald . I agree with her fully . NOVEMBER 11 , 1928 . Herbert Hoover , the great engineer who had us eating alfalfa bread during the war , was elected President Tuesday by the greatest majority ever . He received 444 electoral votes to Al Smith 's 87 . Hoover is an astute fellow ; and probably will make a good President . But I was hoping for Smith 's election on the prohibitionquestion , if no other . The Eighteenth Amendment and Volstcad act have turned out to be ghastly farces . Everyone is drinking more now than he did before prohibition and there is absolutely no regulation . The whisky and gin are terrible . There are countless cases of blindness and invalidism caused by poison liquor . When I think of Byron going out with the boys and know that virtually every other boy carries a pocket flask to parties , I scarcely can sleep . Nobody wants the return of the old-time saloon . Al Smith has said time and time again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return of whisky and the saloon . What he wants and what every decent man wants is legal light wine and beer . With light wine and beer of a low alcoholic content legal no one would think of drinking whisky . Drinking would be done as it is in Europe  --  for sociability , not drunkenness . JULY 14 , 1929 . Usually on Sunday I drop down to the office early in the afternoon to look over the mail and go over prospectsfor the night 's news and art with Harvey Thorpe . Then ,   if I have time , I slip over to Syra Morris ' apartment on ShermanStreet for a cup of tea and a chat on literature . I did n't go today . Pearl had her teeth pulled Friday and was still feeling miserable . Lately she has been suffering more or less from neuralgia and the doctor decided her teeth were the cause of it . She is living on thin soups and milk until her mouth heals enough for her to have false teeth . She feels very bad about it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diet . She does n't want anyone she knows to see her now so she is hiding out pretty much . We did , however , take a ride up to Boulder this afternoon , with Byron driving . Byron was graduated from North Denver High School last month and will enter the University of Colorado at Boulder this fall . I had hoped to send him to Harvard or to the MassachusettsInstitute of Technology , for the boy has real talents for engineering or science . But the fact of the matter is I simply wo n't have the money this year . And , after all , a year or so general arts course at Boulder will be a fine preliminary to studying science . Byron really is pleased at the prospect of going to Boulder . His particular friend , Wallace French , is going there . And I understand there also is a little girl named Geneva Berryman whom Byron admires who will be a co-ed at Colorado U.Byron 's mind frequently amazes me . At times it is difficult to realize he is only 18 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wants to know the underlying reasons for the causes of the facts . He has a professorial tone of voice which gives me a big kick . The other evening Frank Chapin and his wife were over to the house listening to our new superheterodyne radio and we were talking about the activities of Henry Ford . Frank said something about Commander Richard E. Byrd using a Ford plane to fly across the North Pole . P275Byron scratched a match to light his bulldog pipe . " No , Chapin , " he said , " you 're wrong there . Byrd used a Fokker trimotored plane . What confused you was the fact the ship was named the Josephine Ford . You sec , Edscl Ford was one of Byrd 's sponsors . " Frank was so confused and taken aback that he flushed . He really could n't think of a thing to say . The next day I checked up on the matter at the office and found Byron was dead right . A memory like that will prove a great asset to the boy . Byron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground and particularly to pick out the fraternity house in which he 'll live . Pearl thought he should join the Sigma Chi , mainly because there is a song , " The Sweetheart of Sigma Chi , " which she thinks is cute . Byron , however , was rightfullyscornful of argument that he should join a particular fraternity simply because they had a " cute song . " We drove by all the fraternity houses we could find and Byron finally decided on the Beta Theta Pi as being the most desirable . The place looks pretty grand and I had a thought it might be wise to find out just how much it costs to live there before Byron sets his mind too fully on it . There might be a possibility that only moderately rich boys could live in such a place . Pearl overruled that thought violently , though . And she was right . " All we 'll be able to give the boy is an education , " she said , " and everybody who has been to college admits the happiest time of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty poor parents , after all , if we were n't willing to make , personal sacrifices for Byron while he is in college . Moreover , if he lives in a first-class fraternity house he may make social and business connections which will prove most valuable in later life . Syra has lent me a couple of books of poetry in the
