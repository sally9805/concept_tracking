When Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr . returned from Europe last September , newsreel cameramen cornered him on deck . He ducked , grinned , protested : " No , honestly , I 'm camera shy . " When cameramen in a boat edged up to the shell in which Roosevelt Jr . was practicing with the Harvard freshman crew one week later , he did not grin . Barked he : <P> " I 'll punch you in the nose . And I really mean it . . . . " <P> The Press might have observed that here was one Roosevelt who genuinely did not want to have his picture in the papers . Publicity was necessary to his parents , and acceptable to his sister and brothers . But to Franklin Jr. , who sought the easy camaraderie of other Harvard freshmen , which he could not have as a publicized personage , it was anathema . <P> Last week at some wrestling matches in Philadelphia . Arena , a slight , dark Public Ledger photographer named Donald Corvelli spotted Franklin Roosevelt Jr . &; party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one cf the wrestlers being hurled from the ring , Cameraman Corvelli popped his flashbulb , aimed his lens at Junior Roosevelt . The latter saw him , ducked forward , but too late . Grinning , Cameraman Corvelli trotted toward an exit . In a flash Roosevelt Jr. , boiling mad , was out of his seat and at the cameraman 's heels . He over-took him in the lobby , spilled him to the floor , jumped up &; down on the camera . Police intervened , companions led Junior Roosevelt away . <P> Still grinning , Photographer Corvelli raced to his office . Junior Roosevelt had forgotten to go after the film plate , which was tucked safely in Corvelli 's pocket during the scuffle.
