In Paris last week for an " indefinite stay " was elegant , hollow-eyed Margherita Sarfatti , once a great personal friend and professional colleague of Benito Mussolini , now in disgrace in Italy because her family , although old honored and Venetian , is also Jewish . Margherita and Benito met when she was art critic and he editor of the Socialist Avanti in Milan , long before he became famous . Through the comparatively tranquil late ' 20s and up until 1935 , when the Duce made most of his private income by writing for the Hearst newspapers , Madame Sarfatti was his " ghost " and manager . When the Dictator wanted a raise from Hearst , she helped to negotiate it , sometimes by arranging improved treatment for Hearstmen in Italy . <P> She was also Mussolini 's official biographer and for many years his closest feminine confidante-though by no means the only one . Her influence waned when her old friend decided to pal around with Jew-tormenting Adolf Hitler , whom she detests . Now all her Government sinecures have been withdrawn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have not been exiled . . . . Please make it clear . . . . "
