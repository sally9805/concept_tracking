In a blinding rainstorm , in a gale strong enough to rip a ton of masonry from the grey and gothic west front of famed York Minster , Edward of Wales last week boarded the S. S. Kenilworth Castle at Southampton Docks , bound for Africa to resume the big game hunt which was interrupted 13 months ago by the critical illness of George V. Announced objective : the shooting of a two-horned rhinoceros , two or three male lions ( H. R. H. 's previous bag contained only lionesses ) . <P> There was no ceremony at the Prince 's sailing . He went aboard as First Class Passenger Windsor and announced that he would eat with the other travelers . In his suite-a sleeping cabin , bath , living room-had been stowed his bags , and a brace of new guns . The rifles he used on his previous African trip were venerable relics , the property of his grandfather Edward VII . <P> No holiday is ever a complete holiday for a member of the House of Windsor . At the Colonial Office last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , H. R. H. is expected to visit Durban , scene of recent Zulu riots , in an attempt to calm Zulus before going north to kill lions .
