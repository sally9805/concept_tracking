txt Unconvinced A driverless automobile , operated by wireless control from another car , negotiated hazardous New York traffic without a mishap recently , Tsiz TIMES tells us . Just another modern miracle which may forecast a whole new era in radio 's possible usefulness . True to form , however , the city authorities caused the arrest of the men responsible for this experiment . It was only because the city 's legislators had somehow failed to pass a law against such an emergency that the experimenters were reluctantly released . Since time immemorial human nature has invariably either persecuted or ridiculed the originator of anything new . Can it be that all our modern inventions have still not convinced us that today 's impossible becomes tomorrow 's commonplace ? Or does it prove that human nature insists on plodding along in the oxcart 's ruts while science takes wings into the stratosphere ? ? S. L. HARMON , Doylestown , Pa.
