txt THE TROUBLE WITH COTTON Hand-to-Mouth Buying Disrupts the Whole Merchandising Scheme . To the Editor of The New York Timcs : I wish to congratulate THE Tniss for the editorial on cotton . it draws attention to what eventually becomes a sound economic condition , and which always follows overproduction . The cotton and spinning trades of the United States have suffered frightfully during the last three years . Attempting to analyze the causes , besides that of overproduction , we find the most serious situation is the now popular hand-to-mouth buying which has been in vogue for four years or more . This has thrown the entire weight back on the mills and the raw products markets . For instance , we have been told of cases where the orders are to buy not more than six weeks ' supply of finished goods under any circumstances . This policy is generally pursued and has been for some time . In the old days the weight was distributed among the wholesalers , distributers and retailers . Now the shelves are bare , practically speaking , of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The result is they buy for their immediate needs . The consequence is it all backs up on the New York futures market to take care of the crop , which must be moved in a relatively short space of time . Speculators sense this situation , and instead of being buyers at ridiculously low prices , as they used to be , stay out of the market . In short , it all boils down to the fact that there is no longer any merchandising in the sense that we knew it twenty years ago . Perhaps economically this is the best way , but if it is , the readjustment is a very severe one and the tax on the manufacturing industry and the farmer is enormous , because the manufacturer can not produce a mass quantity , thus reducing overhead costs : while the farmer can not find the buyers he used to have when the mills would buy for six months at a time when the crop was moving , or speculators would buy distant deliveries in the belief that consumption would warrant higher prices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1930.
