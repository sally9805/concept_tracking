Under the " heavy pressure of circumstances " the Kingdom of Rumania last week signed a trade treaty with the Third Reich which , in effect , converted Rumania from an independent nation to a German dependency . In no instance of modern times has one State made such humiliating , far-reaching economic concessions to another as Rumania 's King Carol II made in Bucharest last week to Dr. Helmuth Wohlthat , Fhrer Hitler 's traveling salesman . <P> The fact that no actual German military aggression had taken place gave Russia and the democracies a chance to turn their eyes from the eastbound Nazi steam roller . The German-Rumanian treaty , which in time is expected to reduce if not wipe out all commerce between Rumania and other States , provides that : <P> 1 ) about 90% of Rumanian oil ( annual production : about 53,300,000 barrels ) , farm products , wheat , timber , bauxite , chromium , copper and sulfate will henceforth be " sold " to Germany , thus going a long way toward ending the Reich 's scarcity of food and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the products in barter marks , manufactured goods and recently acquired Czecho-Slovak arms ( which Rumania will probably never be able to use and which Germany may later grab anyway ) . <P> 3 ) Rumania concedes to Germany free ports on the Danube and Black Sea ( something like the foreign concessions in China ) . <P> 4 ) Rumanian agriculture will be " adjusted " to Germany 's requirements . <P> 5 ) German engineers will build roads , improve river transportation and overhaul the Rumanian railway system . <P> 6 ) New Rumanian oil fields and mines will be exploited by German capital . <P> The " circumstances " which bludgeoned Rumania into signing the treaty consisted largely of troop movements by old as well as new enemies . Fhrer Hitler had massed German soldiers in the eastern tip of his new protectorate of Slovakia , only 75 miles from the Rumanian frontier . If Rumania was physically to fall to Germany ( after Hungary had also fallen ) , other jackal nations might have a chance to dash in and grab a few mouthfuls as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 300,000 men on the Rumanian border . Even little Bulgaria , to the south , mobilized . <P> Richest and largest of the Balkans , Rumania is surrounded by nations which have long and impatiently waited for a chance to grab back some of the territories they had previously lost to the Rumanians . Revisionist-mad Hungarians long for the return of the Banat , Bukovina and Transylvania , old Hungarian provinces lost after the World War to Rumania , peopled now by some 1,500,000 Magyars and 800,000 Germans . Bulgaria has never forgotten that she lost part of the province of Dobruja to Rumania in 1913 and that some 500,000 Dobrujans are now Rumanian subjects . Bessarabia , to the northeast , with 1,500,000 Ukrainians , Russians and Poles , was absorbed by Rumania from Soviet Russia in 1920 . Of Rumania 's five neighbors , only two-Yugoslavia and Poland-do not hold grudges against her .
