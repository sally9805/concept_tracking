 | IT IS four days by steamer from Buenos Aires to Asuncion , the capital of Paraguay . We might have made the journey by rail in 52 hours , on a train that crosses the Parana River by ferry from Zarate , 56 miles from Buenos Aires , to lbicuy ; passes through the fertile Argentine Mesopotamia , between the Parana and Uruguay rivers , to the Argentine frontier ; recrosses to the Paraguayan shore on another ferry , and continues through undulating grass and woodland to Asuncion . However , remembering with pleasure our first voyage up the Parana 14 years earlier , we chose the steamer to carry us to this remote , river-encircled country , so rich in dramatic history and so little known to North Americans . For three days after sailing we had Argentina 's richest agricultural provinces on either side . The river , at first gulflike , narrowed between low-lying islands fringed with feathery pampas grass . On our former voyage , at flood season , I had seen the shore villages nearly submerged , the stream strewn with floating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeds , and roots , upon which carpinchos , or capybaras , snakes , and other upriver creatures were borne seaward . The harbor of Montevideo had been so choked at that time with these strange floating islands that traffic was seriously hampered . Our present voyage was in the floodless month of July , midwinter at this end of the hemisphere . Fortunately , each day brought us nearer a mild climate . Our fellow passengers were mostly home-bound Paraguayans . There were several Argentine families escaping from cold weather and a few commercial travelers . All spoke the musical tongue of Cervantes , the speech of some 100,000,000 people to-day . The man next me at table declared he thought English a brutally harsh language . " Imagine , " he said , " trying to say shrimps when you mean camarones l " NO MEAL FOR A VEGETARIAN Dinner , an elaborate seven-course meal , was not planned for vegetarians : thin soup of meat stock , cold meat and salad , thick soup of meat and vegetables , meat and greens , cheese and fruit paste , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrument of torture , the riversteamer piano , sounded far into the night ; but it seemed not to disturb the card and domino players , who gathered in the saloon under a placard announcing that gambling was strictly prohibited . There are travelers who always wear an historic lens . I confess to an unflagging interest in the old Conquistadores . We followed in the wake of Sebastian Cabot 's sturdy caravel , plowing its way up the uncharted waters of the Plata to the Parana ( Mother of the Sea ) , and on to the Paraguay , at the gates of the Tropics . It was in 1526 that Cabot , a Venetian pilot in the service of Spain , followed the lead of Juan de Solis and Magellan , and  | haded his caravel up the great muddy tide which he called the Rio de la Plata , River of Silver . The British have simplified this to " the River Plate . " Americans stutter slightly in calling it " the La Plata , " for , since la is " the " in Spanish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,000 miles upriver and an equal distance from the Brazilian seacoast , is an old city , dating from 1536 . Asuncion babies of Spanish and aboriginal blood had become grandparents when the Pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock . The first American of European blood to hold office , Hernando Arias de Saavedra , governor of Paraguay in 1591 , was born here . By 1600 the city was the metropolis and only important town of a vast territory that comprised the entire southeastern portion of South America , the region occupied to-day by parts , of Argentina , Uruguay , Paraguay , western Brazil , and eastern Bolivia . Buenos Aires was founded at a later period , as a subsidiary settlement nearer the river 's mouth , a convenience to the Asuncion colonists on their way to and from Spain . RIVER GEOGRAPHY AT TIRST HAND I like learning fluvial geography at first hand . We came to the meeting of the Parana and the Uruguay rivers , which form the Plata ; up the Parana we steamed to the junction of the Alto ( Upper ) Parana and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Paraguay 1,800 . When South America was young the basin now cradling these rivers was a vast inland sea , known to geologists as the Pampean Sea . When the Plata took form it was mightier than the Amazon . To-day it drains less than half as much territory as that drained by the King of Rivers . It was not until the fourth day that we reached the point where the clear waters of the Alto Parana mingle with the Paraguay 's amber tide . Palm-studded fields now lay on the eastern shore . We ' passed a village of one-story , buff-colored adobe buildings with red-tile roofs and mosscovered gateways of unmistakable Spanish design . An archaic oxcart jogged across the flower-carpeted green . Flocks of white aquatic birds winged up from the shore . We had reached Paraguay . ED PARAGUAY 387 Until the Pilcomayo River is reached , - at some distance up the River Paraguay , the western shore is Argentine territory . Beyond this point lies the region known as the Chaco , now disputed territory between Paraguay and Bolivia .  | The Pilcomayo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long the river of mystery . For some years its upper and lower reaches have been known , but its middle course has only recently been traced . Almost opposite its mouth lies the colorful city of Asuncion . The colonial Spaniards showed rare judgment in selecting their sites for cities . Here they chose a high bank of the river , safe from the floods , at a point where a peninsula , jutting out into the wide stream , forms a little bay . Because of sandy soil and natural drainage , the city is healthful and is becoming a winter resort for downriver people . The winter climate is not unlike that of southern California . " The only time we ever had a hailstorm , " a Paraguayan told me , " some folks thought the gods were sending down rice . " We found many changes in Asuncion . The city now has about 143,000 inhabitants . Belgian blocks replace cobblestones on the main thoroughfares and automobiles jostle bullock carts . Patterning after its big sisters downriver , Asuncion is gradually destroying its dignified old buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not yet dismissed the sereno , or night watchman , but he no longer prowls about with a lantern , enveloped in a big black cape . He is just a plain policeman in khaki and brown puttees . His reassuring whistle , answered by the nearest watch , is a feature of Asuncion nights . The modern villas of the residential section are charming . Pink and buff are the prevailing tints . Flaming poinsettias peep 392 THE NATIONAL , GEO (  | over the vine-clad garden walls ; purple bougainvilllea and all manner of colorful climbing plants gladden the doorways . Every garden has its jasmine , roses , and begonias ; its vivid hibiscus , stately palms , and fragrant orange trees . When the gorgeous poinsettia reaches the end of its bloom , the flamboyant tree comes into blossom . ROMANCE LINGERS IN OLD ASUNCION The Cathedral , near the river , beautiful old church of the conquistadores , is the heart of the old town I love . About it are low , one-story houses of massive walls , cool , dim corridors , vine-hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tile . These are distinctive buildings , enveloped in the glamour of a romantic past , reminders of Asuncion 's heroic days . One of them is the house where , in 1811 , the Declaration of Paraguayan Independence was signed . The ceremony occurred either late in the night of May 14 or early in the morning of May 15 . Since no one is certain of the exact hour , both dates are celebrated as a national holiday . When the colony had freed itself from Spain , Dr. Jose Gaspar Rodriguez de Francia , * a native Paraguayan , put aside others appointed with him as a governing board and named himself supreme dictator for life . As El Supremo Perpetuo , 1813-1840 , he isolated his people , ruling them with a rod of iron . Paraguay became the Robinson Crusoe of nations . Although a despot , Francia did much to improve the condition of the country . His reign was followed by that of two other dictators , Carlos and Francisco Lopez , father and son . At the death of Carlos Lopez , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one-man control , had become rich . It had advanced in military importance to become one of the strongest republics on the continent . But the Nation suffered supreme tragedy in the reign of Francisco Solano Lopez , when its manpower was practically exterminated . During the Five Years ' War , 1865-187o , one of the most sanguinary conflicts in * See Thomas Carlyle 's essay on this remarkable man in his " Critical and Miscellaneous Essays " ; also , " El Supremo , " an American historical romance , by Edward Lucas White . history , known to the Paraguayans as the War of the Triple Alliance , this inland nation fought its three more populous neighbors ? Brazil , Argentina , and Uruguay . The Paraguayan proved his valor . When the tide of aggression turned , he battled like a tiger in defense of his homeland . It is doubtful that a nation has ever fought more absolutely to a finish . In the course of the long struggle , all lads over 15 were called to the colors . Even boys of lo entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women took up the fray . Paraguay 's fields lay waste ; most of the herds were killed ; industries were ruined . Poverty and disease stalked the land . The population was reduced to a fifth of its pre-war numbers . The proportion of men to women was one to seven . The land ceded to the allies totaled 56,000 square miles . In passing judgment on this country , we must start with 187o on a foundation of ruin . NO INVALIDS WANTED IN ONE HOTEL A friend in Buenos Aires had suggested we try the French hotel in Asuncion . " The best cooking in town , " he assured us , " but an awfully hard place to get into . The old chap who runs it is mortally afraid of sickness in any form . His guests must have ruddy complexions or bring health credentials . If he finds a medicine bottle among your belongings , you 'll be thrown out , bag and baggage . " We put up at our old rendezvous , the hotel with the splendid view . The Paraguay was rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nearly submerged . It is of interest to geographers to note that the seasons of high and low water in the Parana and the Paraguay rivers are reversed . In Asuncion 's harbor were vessels flying Argentine , Uruguayan , and Paraguayan flags . Steamers under the Brazilian flag were making their 3,050-mile voyage from Rio de Janeiro to Coruinba , a river port in the vast inland province of Mato Grosso . Across the river , which is a little more than a third of a mile wide at this point . we could see the shores of the Paraguayan Chaco . This is the greater but more sparsely settled portion of the country . All but 50,000 of the 800,000 inhabitants of Paraguay live on the eastern , or Asuncion , shore , where the land is slightly rolling ,  | savannas mingling with forests , the treeclad hills rising to perhaps 1,500 feet altitude ( see illustration , page 391 ) . West of the river , in the Chaco , the country is altogether different in character , low-lying , swampy , given over for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reclaimed as a cattle country . This is the region of the present conflict between the Bolivians and the Paraguayans . Chaco ( corrupted from Chucu ) means " hunting ground " in Quichua , the language of the Incas of Peru . Perhaps the ancient Peruvians hunted in this remote region beyond the Andes . Perhaps Inean tribes , fleeing from Spanish invaders , settled here , mingling their blood with that of the original inhabitants . As early as 1537 the intrepid colonists who founded Asuncion plunged through the trackless Chaco in an unsuccessful attempt to reach Peru , where there was a Spanish viceroy , superior officer to the Adelantado of Paraguay . By 1548 a party actually succeeded in reaching the Pacific and returning to Asuncion , taking two years for the round trip . @# By the 17th century 12 different expeditions had crossed this wilderness lying between the Paraguay River and the Peruvian coast . When we recall that expeditions of the present century have been wiped out by Chaco Indians , and realize how inadequate was the equipment of these early Spaniards , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MINGLE Asuncion 's streets are rich in local color . As in other South American capitals , the upper strata look and dress like Americans or Europeans of a similar class ; but , to the delight of the traveler , the masses are still distinctive in costume and customs . In summer the white-garbed women of the market place look like orientals in their long , sheetlike garments draped over head and body . The dress underneath is simple ? a long , full petticoat and a low-necked , sleeveless blouse . The feet are bare . This costume has changed little in the three centuries since the Jesuit missionaries came to lead these Guarani people from savagery to civilization . 396 THE NATIONAL CEO  | On reaching Paraguay the Spaniards found a peaceful , contented people who belied their name of Guaranis ( warriors ) . They formed the southern branch of the powerful Tupis , who , at the time of the Conquest , dominated a vast territory between the Amazon and the Plata , even extending their influence to the forest dwellers of eastern Peru . Guarani @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except for slight modifications by the missionaries , the same language as that used by untutored Tupi tribes throughout the hinterland of Brazil . In Paraguay , as in some of the other Latin-American countries , people of pure European blood are in the minority . The Nation is Hispano-Guarani , with its roots in those tawny sons and daughters of the soil born from the union of adventurous Spaniards and docile Guarani women . While Spanish , used by the educated class and in the schools , is the official language , Guarani is the speech of the masses . Among the innumerable tongues of aboriginal America , this tongue ranks with the Quichua of Peru and Bolivia in importance and vitality . The elite of Asuncion lead quiet , pleasant lives , passing a part of each year on their country estates . Living is cheap and there is no servant problem . Our national American custom of dining as the day wanes , when all outdoors calls us to the most beautiful hour of the twenty-four , is not in favor among Latin Americans . Late afternoon finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the band plays . SOCCER HAS BECOME A NATIONAL , SPORT Drinks popular with the fair sex are iced cane juice and iced water sweetened with grenadine or raspberry syrup . Dancing is the chief diversion , and there is a growing interest in sport . The British have given to South America 's southlands a national game , soccer , or association football . Originally introduced into Argentina , it spread to Uruguay , Brazil , and Chile , and finally to Paraguay . To-day it is undoubtedly the leading sport in these five countries . Stadiums have been erected for it in the larger cities . While Paraguay has not been long at the game , its progress has been astonishing . The Paraguayan is a superior oarsman . With the magnificent stretch of river avail- able at Asuncion , it is little wonder that regattas are frequent and that interest in boating is general . In former years Paraguayan women of the upper class trimmed their gowns with a beautiful native lace , unlike any I have seen in other parts of the world . It is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchant cane to the patio of our hotel with a basket filled with this lace . She had brought it , she said , from a country village some miles from the capital , where all the women made nanduti . " Do you think they would let us photograph them ? " I asked , after we had become friendly through the purchase of innumerable collars and doilies . The vender thought they would , and next morning we were on our way to the ancient village of Itaugua . ON THE TRAIL OF A LOVELY LACE This lovely , filmy nanduti is an evolution from needle-point lace , which came into Spain from Flanders in the 16th century and on to Spain 's colony on the Paraguay . Here , through the years , an original type of handiwork has developed . Between Asuncion and Patino-Cue , our starting point by saddle for the lacemakers ' village , we traveled on one of the oldest railroads in South America , a road begun in 1854 , during the reign of Lopez I , and opened to service in 1861 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . The name Patino-Cue means " The Patino family formerly lived here . " We put up at the home of an English friend . His charming villa , embowered in tropical verdure , looks out on Lake Ipacarai , where there is a prosperous German colony . Next morning we were in the saddle on the nanduti lace trail . Paraguay is a most delightful country for- horseback riding . The ruddy soil , free from dust , the emerald woods , and the turquoise sky make it a rider 's paradise . I was astonished to find the coconut palm so far from the sea . There were miles of the fiber plant called locally caraquata , which looks much like the pineapple . From it the people make ropes and fishlines . Its roots hold water for the thirsty traveler . Tall trees , interlaced with vines , arch the highway . Now and then we had a glimpse of brick-colored adobe walls and palm-thatched roofs back $  | from the road . The sky at sunset was unbelievably beautiful , Joffre-blue and flamingo-tinted clouds drifting across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nearing Itaugua we met girls carrying lace frames . Women and children , from great-grandmothers of 90 to girls of 9 , were on the doorsteps hard at work at their craft . They spoke Spanish as well as their native Guarani . The young women , each with abundant black hair in two long braids , looked attractive in their simple white gowns . Stockingless , they all wore sandals . The lacemaker outlines her pattern with charcoal on the cotton , linen , or silk fabric . After days and weeks of toil , the design becomes as filmy as a cobweb . As many as 12 different patterns , each having its Guarani name , are sometimes introduced into one piece . The women are imitative , working intricate scrolls and floral designs . Their labor and patience bring little in compensation , for a collar , a week 's continuous work , sells for a dollar , and a parasol cover that requires months of toil brings less than $25 ( see page 410 ) . Cattle-raising is Paraguay 's chief industry , meat products leading among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock grasses and ample water supply , is a most promising cattle country . There is probably no stock-raising region in the United States possessing such fine natural grazing lands , in spite of the Chaco 's handicap of occasional inundations . As the vast plains of Argentina are more and more given over to the cultivation of cereals , the cattle ranges are bound to creep north to the grasslands of Paraguay and eastern Bolivia . As early as 1554 cattle were brought to Asuncion from the Portuguese colony at Sao Vincente , near Santos , Brazil . In the same century cattle , sheep , and goats were brought overland across the continent from Peru . In the south , imported Argentine breeds are now seen , but the old stock is still in evidence in the heart of Paraguay . As we travel north we find t  | long-horned zebu cattle from Brazil , introduced into that country from India by the Portuguese . This hardy zebu stock defies the tick . The Paraguayan cowboy is known as the chacrero . Although usually smaller in stature than his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is muscular and hardy , a typical roughrider . On a saddle trip we met a group of cowboys driving a band of cattle from the rodeo , where the herd is rounded up , to the river . I can still hear their ringing cattle call , Co-co-coa ! Co-coa ! Coa ! Coa ! " There were a number of young calves in the herd . When a stream was reached the mother cow entered the water and the calf jumped in after her , placing its head upon her rump . " It 's not all easy sailing , " a cattleman told me . " Snakes are a menace ; their bite kills many animals every year . Then there are jaguars which attack the herd . We lose a few by drowning when the Paraguay shifts its banks ; but the river 's rise is usually gradual , and we have time to drive most of the cattle to higher ground . " Guarani women are most accomplished head-balancers . At the market I saw a bronze Hebe with a basket on her head filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm she held a husky youngster ; under the other a large bundle of firewood . At the same time she directed the progress of three children , led a stubborn , heavily laden donkey , and smoked a long , black cigar . While I was still marveling as to how this was done , a woman passed me with a small envelope poised gracefully on her head . They never think of carrying anything in their hands . The market women smoke big native cigars . The mayor of the city issued an edict that no woman could smoke on the street or walk on the sidewalk with a bundle on her head . This meant that she walked in the middle of the street and hid her cigar when she saw a policeman . I saw youngsters puffing like steam engines . In the country the people grow and roll their own leaf . We bought homemade cigars for seven cents a dozen . Cigarettes are not popular and pipes almost unknown .  | Production of tobacco is an old industry , dating from the early years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hills east of Asuncion . In an interior town we visited a warehouse where more than 2,000 tons of tobacco were stored . The dried leaf comes in from February to May , in oxcarts , by saddle , and on the heads of women . It is stored , sprayed with water , dried , tied into bundles , sorted , pressed , and packed for shipment in 22o-pound bags . The Government inspects and grades all tobacco for export , thus raising its prestige in foreign markets . In recent years cotton has become tobacco 's rival among agricultural crops . ORANGE GROVES 300 YEARS OLD Huge golden mounds of oranges are the most attractive feature of every Paraguayan market . Jesuit missionaries planted the first of these trees three centuries ago and the birds scattered the seeds . Now the orange grows everywhere , even in the heart of the forest , far in the interior . There is a legend that Francia ( see text , page 392 ) gave the orange culture a lift by requiring all landowners to plant and rear at least 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tallest trees grown all who failed to raise this number . The fragrant , thinskinned , flat-topped mandarin orange , prized from earliest times in China and Cochinchina , was brought to Paraguay by an English friend of ours some 40 years ago . There are two varieties of the bitter orange . From the leaves of one of these the oil known as the essence of petit-grain is distilled . Petit-grain is a basis of perfumery and is also used in flavoring extracts . A popular American toilet water has this oil as its base . About 600 pounds of leaves are required to produce one quart of unrefined oil . We went to a town 6o miles from the capital to see the crude process . There was a small still in a palm-thatched hut . Leaves were piled into a vat above the steam , and the vapor was carried off through a pipe to coils where it condensed and cooled . The  | oil on the top was skimmed off , the still producing about a gallon a day . VILLA HAYES NAMED FOR A PRESIDENT OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chaco side of the river , is a settlement of some commercial importance known as Villa Hayes ( pronounced " Ve-ya Eyes " in Spanish ) . It was named after a President of t h e United States , Rutherford B. Hayes , who , acting as arbitrator in d e t e rmining the limits between Argentina and Paraguay , rendered a decision highly favorable to the latter . Ironically , this town , named for an ardent prohibitionist , is surrounded by canefields whose product is distilled into a very powerful rum . A modern link between the United States and Paraguay is the library of 2,000 volumes by American authors presented some years ago by the American Association for International Conciliation to the Instituto Paraguayo . The unique feature of this private institute , founded about 30 years ago by a group of scholarly men for the development of arts and sciences , is that the instructors are Asuncion men of affairs who teach without compensation , after business hours . The " International , " bound for Buenos Aires , leaves Asuncion twice a week at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Alto Parana River , at 9:30 p . M. The route lies through the most populous region , giving the traveler who stays with the beaten path a glimpse of country towns and exquisite landscapes . Our trail was by saddle over the sun-drenched plain , where islands of palms sway in a sea of grass . It was on this journey that we came to know the people of the soil , so contented and hospitable . UTOPIA IN THE GRASSLANDS They are , for the most part , small farmers and stock owners who live simply and comfortably on their own products . Their implements are the ax and the hoe , the machete and the lasso . They have a delightful climate and a fertile soil , plenty  | to eat without hard work . Nearly every farmer has his cattle and fowls ; his garden patch of maize , beans , sweet potatoes , and manioc ; his tobacco plants , bananas , and orange trees . He needs only to buy yerba mate , Paraguay tea , the national beverage . Each house has its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung . The roofs are more often of palm thatch than tile , quite impervious to rain and lasting many years . The palm trunk is split and the fibrous material taken out , leaving half trunks from an inch and a half to two inches thick . These are dried until hard and flinty . The slabs are then laid side by side , curved surface up , from pitch to eaves , and a second overlapping layer is placed over the joined edges to give the effect of tile . The countrywomen are more industrious than the men . During the Five Years ' War ( see text , page 392 ) they became the merchants and farmers of the country . Full of fun and talk and much given to gossip are Suplicante , Rosaria , and the others , and so kind ! I recall a day when I was photographing in one of the villages and tore my skirt on a cactus plant . While I w a s appraising t h e damage a woman ran out of a near-by house with a needle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deftly mended my gown . SOLICITOUSNESS MAY BE EMBARRASSING One act of courtesy proved disconcerting . On an upriver voyage we were presented with a huge cage containing six big , black birds . " They are wonderful birds , " said the man who gave them to us . " If you 'll cut their tongues , they 'll talk better than parrots . " We accepted them trustfully , with no thought of tongue-cutting , of course . They turned out to be wicked birds . They scratched , pecked , and shrieked . We decided to get rid of them . On the evening of our arrival at a river port we carried the cage into the moonlit patio of the hotel and liberated the birds , telling them to fly north to their home forest . A peaceful night ensued . Next morning several hotel servants , with smiling faces , greeted us.  | " We 've been so fortunate , " said the spokesman . " Your birds escaped . At dawn we saw them in that big tree . They are fine birds , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All the Paraguayan villages looked alike to me . They more or less follow the form prescribed by the Jesuit missionaries ? a roomy , level plaza with buildings on three sides . For 16o years , 1607-1767 , the Jesuits worked among the Guaranis , transforming prowling savages into prosperous farmers . In leisure hours the newly made farmer was entertained by dances , songs , and pageants . JESUITS WORKED WONDERS AMONG THE TRIBES About 150,000 Indians were gathered in 30 or more settlements on both sides of the Alto Parana River , the missionaries having complete dominion over a territory as large as France . In time the fields were covered with herds of cattle , horses , and sheep . Orange trees were planted in every town ; craft laden with yerba mate , hides , linseed , sugar cane , wheat , maize , and tobacco floated down the river highway . The amazing feature was the development of art among these simple natives , who erected imposing churches with elaborately carved facades and altars . Great blocks of Tacuru stone were used . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it hardens on exposure to the air . When the Jesuits were expelled from all Spanish possessions , their flock scattered , and churches , schools , and hospitals fell into decay . We saw the ruins of several of the fine old churches , nearly smothered by the tropical forest . Around them are clumps of golden orange trees and groves of stately palms . Though in a sadly battered condition , the carving of stone and wood is most impressive . Even before the coming of the Jesuits , the Guaranis drank tea brewed from the leaves of the wild yerba tree . To-day millions of South Americans drink this Paraguay tea . Among the gentry of the larger cities , Asiatic tea is now supplanting the native beverage , but in the country yerba mate holds its own .  | The tree from which the leaves are obtained is an evergreen of the holly family , somewhat resembling the orange tree in appearance , but taller and less bushy . It is indigenous to Paraguay , southwestern Brazil , and the northern province of Argentina , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the East Indies . The yerba gatherers strip the smaller branches from the tree and pass them over a blazing fire . For a second toasting over a slow fire , the cuttings are then carried to a crude platform erected in the forest . After scorching for a day or more , the leaves , now thoroughly dry , are beaten into bits and packed into hide bags for shipment by bullock cart or river craft to the nearest warehouse , where they are cleaned and sorted ( see page 412 ) . The dried leaf from which the tea is prepared , the drink itself , and the hollowed gourd which serves as a cup are all known as mate . A metal tube called the bombilla ( little pump ) is used instead of a spoon . At one end it has a strainer through which tea is sucked . Some of the gourds are carved and ornamented with silver . The tea is prepared by pouring boiling water over a spoonful of leaves . The good old-fashioned way of drinking it is to pass the mate around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sip ( see page 413 ) . Among the ruins of Jesuit churches I saw 17th-century dates cut on beams exposed to tropical storms and burning suns , seemingly as strong and durable as when erected . These beams were hewn from the urundeymi , one of the forest giants , but a little brother when compared with the towering petereby , cedro , and lapacho . Our saddle trips took us into the heart of the forest rich in these hardwoods . The logs are dragged through the woods by oxen and rafted downstream . Three logs of a lighter hardwood , like the Spanish cedar , are used to one very heavy log , like lapacho or jacaranda . In the spring the lapacho is a glorious sight , with its variegated rose and gold flowers . The jacaranda is loaded with large panicles of purplish-blue blossoms of rarest beauty , resembling the flower clusters of the wistaria . Jacaranda wood  | makes the finest and most durable of furniture . Two distinctive trees of the Alto Parana basin are the araucaria , a variety of pine with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open Chinese umbrella ; and the samuhu , or silk-cotton tree , with its lacy , daintily tasseled branches . With the silky strands of the samuhu 's flower the Guarani women stuff their pillows . PARAGUAY PALMS YIELD MANY USEFUL PRODUCTS Palms are a feature of the Paraguayan landscape . Oil is obtained from the nuts , which are also used in fattening stock . Hats , hammocks , ropes , and cloth are manufactured from a textile made from the leaves . A forest creeper growing 50 to 6o feet long is used for rope . One of my pleasantest remembrances of travel in any part of the world is of our voyages up the Alto Parana . Few rivers in tropical America rival it in beauty ? a clear , swift stream in these upper reaches , bordered by high wooded cliffs , where bamboos 6o feet in height wave like titanic plumes . Trees ablaze with scarlet blossoms flare from the dense verdure . White butterflies , like a shower of snowy confetti , drift over the steamer 's prow . Rubywinged birds flit by . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , glides out from the shore . The steamer 's shrill toot , as we near a landing , is a discordant note here in Arcadia . Huge rafts of linked logs pass us on their way downstream . At one of the logging camps an exquisite waterfall 5o feet in height is utilized to hurl down timber from a branch stream . Behind this waterfall swallows dart , and below , in the foam , whirls the body of an unfortunate tapir which ventured too near the brink . We pass fire-scarred clearings on the face of the cliff , where mate bags slide streamward through long bamboo chutes . On our ship is a party of yerba gatherers bound for an upriver port . At night , under the starry canopy of the southern heavens , they bring out their guitars and we listen to the sweet and minor notes of old gaucho melodies . On the west bank is Paraguay ; on the east , Argentina . Now we reach the point where the Iguazu River , border line between Argentina and Brazil , joins the parent stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steamer 's deck . Twelve miles above its junction with the Parana. the Iguazu River adventures its mighty leap . Both Brazil and Argentina claim one of the most beautiful of the world 's waterfalls ( see page 386 ) . About 120 miles above this point we reach the head of navigation on the Alto Parana . Here boiling whirlpools and crosscurrents tell of some of the mightiest of all cascades , 30 miles upstream ? the i8 smoking cataracts of Guaira , shared by Brazil and Paraguay . Niagara 's average flow , above the falls , is estimated at 12,500,000 cubic feet a minute . Guaira 's is estimated at 13,000 , - 000 cubic feet a minute in normal flow and double and treble that amount in annual flood season . THE WATER GIANT ROARS BETWEEN OLIVES The total fall from the upper to the lower river is 310 feet . At one point the cliffs are only 200 feet apart , and the whole mighty impact , backed by the reserve power of countless tributaries , roars through this narrow gateway . Only from an airplane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an area and so closely framed by virgin forest . It was on the Alto Parana River , at the meeting place of the three republics , that  | we made the acquaintance of " Bichy Mosquit . " She was a little grison , a wild animal unknown in N o r t h America , related to the tayra and the marten . Perhaps Father and Mother Grison were killed by an evil-eyed rattler . An Indian picked up t h e furry little creature and carried her to the river , where he traded her to the steamer captain for a bottle of rum . The captain gave the baby grison to me , and for a year and a half she was a part of our caravan . In some parts of South America animals are called " bichos . " Perhaps the 57 varieties of mosquitoes and sandflies suggested her s e c o n d name ; anyway , she became " Bichy Mosquit . " She was about the size of a squirrel , with a squirrel 's long , fluffy tail . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a ferret 's head , bright little eyes , flat ears , and very sharp teeth . I did not know , until I reached Washington and consulted a book on mammals , that the grison is " very savage and troublesome , with beady eyes and a malignant , bloodthirsty face . " THE END OF A PERFECT PET Eventually she and I were poisoned in French Guiana by a decidedly passe toucan stew . She died and I survived . She was buried in the forest , which was her rightful home . If she had lived to reach New York , she would have been the only one of her kind in North America . After the voyage to the falls , we visited a number of towns in the interior of Paraguay , this time by motor bus , remaining for some time in Villarrica ( formerly called Villa Rica ) . This city , second in size in Paraguay , is charmingly situated among the hills ( see page 401 ) . At the market , women carried their babies on their hips , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which were excellent . Many are shipped to Argentina . Wild doves , caught in traps , sold for five cents each . In one of the parks we saw a statue to a famous son of Villarrica , Silvio Pettirossi , the aviator who held San Francisco crowds enthralled at the Panama-Pacific  | International Exposition . He was killed on a cross-country flight in Argentina , and his body was brought back with pride and sorrow to the land of his birth . Many agricultural colonies of natives and foreigners are scattered throughout the country . In Asuncion the Government maintains an immigrant hotel . The Banco Agricola , a Government institution devoted to the promotion of agriculture , does valuable work , especially in encouraging diversified crops . " AX-BREAKER " TREE , RICH IN TANNIN , LURES MODERN CHACO EXPLORERS Having crossed the country and trailed its eastern and southern boundaries , we voyaged up the Paraguay River to the northernmost limits of the Republic and on into the Brazilian territory of Mato Grosso . This was the route followed by the Roosevelt Expedition . The Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chamacocos . The men painted their faces and wore blue and white bead necklaces and primitive homespun garments . The women wore even less . The modern explorers of the Chaco are the men engaged in the quebracho industry . It developed with the expansion of the Argentine railways , when quebracho logs were found to be just the thing for railway ties and for fence posts on the extensive Argentine ranches . Quebracho ( the word means " axbreaker " ) is a hardwood so durable that logs cut and left in the forest for 25 years have been found sound . The tree , which is native to the Paraguay and Parana drainage basin , is scattered throughout the Chaco . Its gleaming , bright-green foliage somewhat resembles that of the mahogany of more northern forests . There is an American quebracho and cattle company 's plant at Puerto Pinasco , two days ' steamer trip above Asuncion . After the jungle is cleared of quebracho trees the cattle are turned in . Of the two species , the red variety of quebracho is far the richer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the bark of the oak tree , but the whole trunk of the quebracho is utilized . While logs later to be converted into tanning extract are still shipped , several factories in Paraguay manufacture the extract . This extract is not used alone , but is combined with that of the chestnut , oak , hemlock , mangrove , or some other material to hasten the tanning process . The quiet backwaters of the Paraguay River are gemmed with sweet-scented Victoria regia lilies . In May and June these most gorgeous of all waterlilies are in full bloom , white with a pink rim when first opened , the pink spreading and deepening with the passing days until the flower is of reddish tinge . Later in the season , myriad waterfowl glean the seeds . The Indians gather these seeds for the mealy substance encased in the thin shell ; from it they make a nutritious bread . One of the forest trees has a beautiful white flower resembling the orange blossom . On its twigs are lumps of wax deposited by a species of ant . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BEAN USED FOR FOOD AND BEER The nourishing bean of the algaroba tree , pounded into flour for cakes , forms an important article of Chaco Indian diet . Brewed into native beer , it is accountable for much drunkenness . I can never forget the sky scenery on the voyage up the Paraguay ? the lovely starry nights ; the flamingo-tinted dawns when we watched for jaguars , which at this hour I  | sometimes swam across the river ; the evening hour when the sun , like a great ball of fire , went down in the Chaco , a n d the aerial squadron of the gods , in multicolored glory , drifted across the sky . The river 's eastern bank is alluringly beautiful , at times like t h e parks bordering English rivers ; again , heavily wooded , it is an impenetrable wall of vines and creepers . WILD BIRD LIFE ABOUNDS At high water we overlooked , on the Chaco shore , vast areas of carandai fan palms set in a carpet of thick , spiny grass three or four feet high . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palm grove , and teems with bird life . The jabiru stork , standing five feet high , lives on the margins of Chaco lagoons . It is a brave , intelligent bird , very savage in the wild state , but friendly i f domesticated . An acquaintance of ours has one as a pet . The rhea , the South American ostrich , is called the fandli by the Guaranis . It is a relic of those long-ago days when giant avians as well as giant mammals roamed these far southern plains . It differs a little from its Argentine neighbor . Both are smaller and less showy as to plumage than their African cousin . The rhea has three toes , the African ostrich two ; the rhea 's head and neck are covered with short feathers , the African 's is bare . The rhea 's plumage is best known through the old-fashioned feather duster . The Chaco is uniformly flat , its climate one of the extremes . It is a land of heavy rainfalls and long-continued droughts . Animal life is abundant . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiast told me . " From May to August is the best season , freer from insect pests . We go duck-shooting in flat-bottomed boats on a chain of smaller rivers and lagoons . " Besides duck , quail , and snipe , there is a native " turkey of the mountain , " with a black head , black head tufts , and a yellow and black beak . Tapir , deer , carpincho , otter , and coypu abound in the marshy regions . Coypu skins are exported from the lower Plata to the United States , the p 416 hair to be used in the manufacture of felt hats for men . In the woods are the jaguar , puma , anteater , armadillo , the maned wolf , and the peccary , the latter always one of a troop . On the eastern shore I saw monkeys disputing with the birds the possession of the tallest trees . The males of the howling-monkey family , most powerful but dullest of the South American apes , have a curious hollow organ in the throat enabling them to emit a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swamps teem with fish and eels . Fishing forms one of the chief means of sustenance of the Indians . The sting ray , with the sting rising like a fin from the base of its tail , lurks in the mud to retaliate if trodden upon by the fishermen . A common foe is the carib fish , with a bulldog jaw and triangular , razor-sharp teeth which can tear the flesh . It makes river bathing unpopular . The Indians spear alligators , but the passengers on our steamer shot constantly at the beasts with indifferent success . We saw water snakes 15 feet long . They coiled among the waterlilies which clogged the paddle wheels when the steamer tied up . At ports we saw for sale snakeskins nearly 20 feet long , and suspected that they had been well stretched by the natives , since the price advances with the length . Poisonous snakes , including rattlers , are a menace to the naked feet of the Indian . Snakeskins , egret skins , hides , rubber , and ipecacuanha formed the downriver cargo . We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Brazilian port on the Upper Paraguay . A Brazilian railroad connects this portion of the river with the Atlantic coast . North American travelers bound for Asuncion can , if they like . take this route via Santos , Sao Paulo , and Porto Esperanca , on the Paraguay . We returned by boat to Asuncion and boarded the train for Buenos Aires . Among my most vivid memories of Paraguay are scenes on its two great flowing highways ; and the exquisite coloring of terra-cotta earth , chrome-green forest , and rainbow-tinted sky . f
