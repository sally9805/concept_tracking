Last week after months of milling &; mauling in qualifying tournaments sponsored by the U. S. Army , the National Amateur Athletic Union , the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the Chicago Tribune , 16 top-notch amateur boxers trooped into the Chicago Stadium to fight it out for the eight National Golden Gloves titles . Since a title automatically carried with it a place on the U. S. Olympic boxing team , 19,000 fight fans paid $33,000 to see these fisticuffs . Though they witnessed no knockouts , they received their money 's worth , watching : The 118-lb. championship match which Jackie Wilson , a six-foot Negro bootblack won simply because his pint-sized opponent could not reach his face . The 147-lb. title bout which Negro Howell King won despite the unholy booing of partisan spectators who thought he had overcome Chicago 's own Chester Rutecki by low punches . The 160-lb. championship contest which went to Negro Jimmy Clark , who was so enraged at the continued booing that he floored his Syracuse University opponent for a count of nine in the first round . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who beat to a pulp the handsome face of plucky , tattooed William Townsend , who junketed 5,000 mi. from his U. S. Army post in Hawaii for the tournament . The heavyweight championship in which the listless performance of winning Negro Arthur Oliver and losing Negro Willis Johnson again prompted spectators to boo . Unprecedented result was that to Berlin this summer will go a U. S. Olympic boxing team composed of four whites , four blacks .
