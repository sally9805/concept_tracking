From the snowy wastes of Northern China came missionary reports last week that Mongol hordes have now established a. new Japan-controlled autonomous nation in Chahar Province " similar to Japan 's puppet-state of Manchukuo , " are calling it " Mongokuo . " This territory , wedged between Manchukuo and Suiyan Province , is roughly the size of Ohio , has its capital at Chap Ser . Another slice of China has thus nearly if not quite been added to the Japanese Empire . <P> In China 's adjacent Suiyan Province , where Japanese penetration was halted four months ago by Chinese troops , consternation reigned last week . Clarioned Suiyan 's Chinese Governor General Fu Tso-yi : " We shall countenance no threat to the integrity of this province ! " He mobilized and reviewed the whole of Suiyan 's military might " in tribute to Chinese soldiers slain in the 1936 defeat of the Mongol horde . " To Suiyan 's rebuke , China 's Nanking Government added another . Declared Wang Ching-wei , chairman of the Kuomintang ( National Revolutionary Party ) and onetime Foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against revolutionary movements . " <P> Prime mover in Mongokuo 's " independence movement , " and Dictator Chiang Kai-shek 's Bogieman No. 1 , last week was triple-chinned Mongol Prince Teh , who for months past has dominated Mongokuo under Japan 's aegis . Exclaimed a Chinese traveler , just returned to Shanghai after a six-month visit to Mongokuo : " I am astonished that the world has not heard of this new state ! " For months Mongokuo has had a de facto government , headed by Prince Teh , together with an army of some 10,000 Mongolians and Manchukuoans officered and commanded by Japanese . Governmental departments are headed by Mongols , but are run by Japanese " advisers " as in Manchukuo . <P> Mongokuo has long had its own post office , issues its own stamps for internal use . Letters going " abroad " are handled by Manchukuo 's post office . Mongokuo even flies its own flag , blue with a square of horizontal red , yellow , white and black stripes in one corner . <P> For months past military equipment from bullets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planes bear the Japanese emblem of the Rising Sun , others the crossed thunderbolts of Prince Teh . All Mongokuo 's tanks and planes are in charge of Japanese mechanics . <P> These military preparations , so newshawks in China assume , are for a new Japanese attack upon Suiyan which must be conquered before Japanese militarists can begin to draw their projected iron ring around Russia 's Outer Mongolia . Tokyo 's bland explanation of Mongokuo 's piled-up tanks and planes was lately voiced by a member of Japan 's Foreign Office : " The Mongols are striving to preserve themselves from Communists against whom they are preparing for a war of self-defense . " Overlooked by the Tokyo spokesman was the fact that the nearest Chinese Communist army was 400 miles from Mongokuo , is headed in the wrong direction , that Suiyan 's Governor General Fu Tso-yi is rabidly antiCommunist.
