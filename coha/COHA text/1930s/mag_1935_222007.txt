In the citrus year ending last October , U. S. citizens consumed 163,029 carloads of oranges , lemons and grapefruit-39% more than the five-year average through 1929 and an all-time record . Two-thirds of the U. S. citrus crop is harvested in the California-Arizona area . Except for a smallish Texas production ( largely grapefruit ) , Florida accounts for the rest. * And since three-fourths of the California-Arizona crop is marketed by California Fruit Growers Exchange , that famed co-operative is by far the largest factor in the U. S. citrus industry . Last week the 13,500 fruit-growing members were thumbing through the long report presented fortnight ago by General Manager Paul Stuart Armstrong at the Exchange 's annual meeting in Los Angeles . <P> One of the biggest and most successful co-operatives in the world , Russia included , California Fruit Growers Exchange evolved from local marketing associations started in Southern California in the 1890 's . Today growers belong to packing associations which grade and pack their fruit at cost . The packing associations belong to district associations , which in turn elect the 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except citrus is handled . <P> The Exchange has selling offices in all big U. S. cities , regulates the flow of fruit to market , maintains research laboratories , owns lumber mills ( boxes ) , operates orange and lemon processing plants ( oils and extracts ) , promotes the interests of the industry in general , California 's in particular . It works constantly for reductions in freight rates , which , with refrigeration , represent about one-third of the wholesale value of California citrus . But most notable achievement has been to make orange juice at breakfast a national institution . <P> Since 1907 the Exchange has spent $21,600,000 advertising its brand name Sunkist . Last year its advertising budget included $1,450,000 for oranges , $581,000 for lemons , $34,600 for grapefruit . Average gross return to growers was about $2.30 per box . For advertising the Exchange assessed each grower 5 per box for oranges , 3 for grapefruit ( Florida dominates that market ) , 10 for lemons , of which there is a perennial surplus . All other Exchange services cost 5.31 per box , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per box ) total marketing and advertising charges amounted to about 4% of gross sales , which were more than $100,000,000 . <P> General Manager Armstrong booms the doctrine of advertising when it is needed , not solely when it can be afforded . He can justify his doctrine by the fact that citrus consumption rose through Depression when sale of many other fruits declined . A husky six-footer who entered the Exchange directly after graduation from the University of Michigan ( class of 1915 ) , he worked up through the advertising department , helped develop the orange-promoting Sunkist juicer , now urges , among other citrus uses , lemon juice as a hair rinse . <P> Next to petroleum , citrus is California 's biggest industry . In the past half century some $2,000,000,000 worth of citrus fruits have gone to market , a figure larger than total California gold production since 1849 . Outlook for the current citrus year in California is rosy , since Florida groves were badly frosted last winter . <P>               @ @ @ @ @ @
