txt Our Stake in the East . To the Editor of The New York Times : Amid the welter of adverse criticism of a boycott against Japan . it is discouraging to view the mass of uninformed " conservatism " expressed in the United States . Apparently these isolationists do not know that 80 per cent of the world 's supply of antimony is produced in Northern China and Manchuria ; that the greatest publishing nation in the world  --  the United States  --  imports about 90 per cent of this output for its type , as well as its automotive trades ; that 63 per cent of the world 's tungsten resources are found in Inner Mongolia and Western China , over 50 per cent of which supply is imported by the greatest high-speed steel manufacturing nation  --  the United States . These are only two of the economic interests of this country in the Far East , and merely offer a hint of the volume and ramifications of American versus Japan controlled transportation , port and financing operations .
