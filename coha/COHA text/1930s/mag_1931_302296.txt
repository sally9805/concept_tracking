Great homage is poured out on the head of a large bank . Less homage goes to the president of a great life insurance company , and for no good reason except that it " does not seem as large . " Consider , however , the New York Life Insurance Co. : it has assets of $1,789,000,000 ( only three U. S. banks , Chase , Guaranty Trust and National City , surpass it in resources ) . The president of this 86-year-old corporation is a person of importance . When he goes in to his directors ( on the second Wednesday of the month ) there are among others present the Republican boss of New York ( Charles Dewey Hilles ) , the chairman of a great railroad ( Hale Holden ) , the chairman of the largest bank in Chicago ( George McClelland Reynolds ) , the president of the largest university in the U. S. ( Nicholas Murray Butler ) , a onetime president of the U. S. itself . <P> For 24 years this presidency has belonged to Darwin Pearl Kingsley , 73 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 66 . Mr. Kingsley will become chairman of the board , a post created for him . With him Mr. Kingsley will carry the memories of his early adventurous days in the roughneck towns of Colorado ; also his secret hobby ( he is a member of the Hobby Club ) : Shakespeare . He owns four early folios , including the fabulous first , picked up at Quaritch 's in Piccadilly . In the library of his office ( in his company 's new building on the site of Madison Square Garden ) a secret spring opens a secret panel revealing a miniature picture of Shakespeare meditating . <P> The new president , Mr. Buckner. has a slightly different past . He entered the service of the company at 15 as an office boy* to his father ( a onetime school teacher who ran the Milwaukee agency ) . In 50 years and more of his employment he has acquired the following list of hobbies : 1 ) his family-two children ; 2 ) the company ; 3 ) reading ; + 4 ) bridge ; 5 ) radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that messages of inspiration from Mr. Buckners gifted pen have sold millions of life insurance . New York Life agents receive such messages regularly . Extracts from one : <P> PEP vs . PIP <P> Which is to say the difference between a man and a hen . . . . Pep is something that makes a man straighten up , throw out his chest , stick out his chin , and do things . . . . It brightens his wits . It sharpens his tongue . It creates sunshine all around him . . . . <P> Pip is something that sends shivers down the back and saps all the energy in the body . Did you ever see a hen with pip ? Her wings are drooped , her feathers ruffled , her head hangs down . . . her cackle is gone , her eyes are watery . . . . She is sick all over . <P> Have you PEP or the Pip ? . . . <P> PEP takes the " t " out of ca n't and the " i " out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he . One of his maxims : " Show me a GOOD office boy and I will show you a future executive . " <P> + He has said : " Every reader of Lincoln 's life will be benefited immeasurably . As to fiction among those I like best are Dickens . Bulwer-Lytton , Stevenson , Scott , Dumas , Hugo and Mark Twain. "
