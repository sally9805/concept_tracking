SILVER VIRGIN A STORY BY BENEDICT THIELEN rr HE car wound up the narrow dusty I road toward the old town that stood on the hill . The terraced hillsides were green with vines and the smooth shining leaves of orange and lemon trees . In the valleys the cypresses thrust their dark blades into the sky above the misty gray olive groves . Beyond them was the sea . Mr. ' Wright , sitting in the front scat next to Amedee , the chauffeur , turned round and smiled at his wife and his daughter Mildred . They smiled back and nodded their heads approvingly at the landscape . " foil , " Mr. Wright said to the chauffeur , raising his voice to make himself heard above the constantly blowing horn . " Tres joli . " " La Provence . " The chauffeur lifted his hand from the horn to make a broad explanatory gesture . " Well , well , is that so ? " said Mr. Wright in English , his voice in the momentary silence sounding unexpectedly harsh anti loud . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall again on the button of the horn . Mr. Wright reflected once again on why it was that everyone assumed that he knew nothing whatever about anything . Of course it was natural that his wife and daughter should  --  in America a man is guilty , intellectually , until proven innocent  --  but why should even Amedee instinctively share this general opinion ? He thought about it , briefly and without bitterness . The hell with it ... or , asthey said for everything in this country , je m'en fiche . The car went round a curve in the road and stopped by the big medieval gate that was still the only entrance to the walled town . " My ! " said Mrs. Wright as they got out , " is n't this picturesque ? " " Certainly is . " Mr. Wright looked round and nodded . " Very . " And it was . It reminded you of the pictures in old story-books , in King Arthur and Sir Walter Scott . When you looked at it you could imagine knights in full armor storming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the windows of the high square tower . That was a great thing about Europe : you saw all the things you had read about so clearly there before you . But after all this time that they had been here the novelty of this kind of thing had begun to wear off a little . You had seen it in so many towns , in the hill towns of Italy and the castles on the Rhine and Nuremberg and Carcassonne . You got a little tired perhaps of seeing knights in full armor constantly before you . You wanted something else . But what ? What else was it that people expected to find over here in Europe ? What peculiar magic ? Mr. Wright began to turn the question over in his mind but was interrupted . " Oh , look ! " Mildred called out . " Look at that cute little old antique shop ! " Mrs. Wright jerked her head away from the city gate and froze into immobility . In the tenseness of her pose there was something of the quality of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then with one concerted movement she and her daughter headed for the antique shop . Mr. Wright watched them go , then turned and walked over to the wall which circled the town and from which the land fell away abruptly to the valley . Amedee was standing there slowly rolling a cigarette and it seemed to Mr. Wright that for the first time in their acquaintance he caught a trace of sympathy in his eyes . " Hs , " Mr. Wright said , half looking back over his shoulder , " I mean elles .. . elles vont faire des emplettes . " Amedee looked blank and Mr. Wright thought , Come on , fishface , you know damn well what I mean ; but then he remembered that although emplettes was one of the words that was most emphasized in all manuals of French conversation no one over here ever seemed to use it and that the proper word for " shopping " was courses . " Des courses , " he said . " All , des courses ! " Amedee exclaimed . " Des courses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . " Des antiquites . . . " For some moments he stared disconsolately down at the charred and jagged end of his cigarette , then he said , " Tout ca , vous savez , c'est pour les poires . " Now Mr. Wright was by no means an expert in the French language , and whenever he started to form a sentence in it in the presence of his wife or daughter their looks were so blightingly indulgent that he was never able to bring out more than one or two mumbled syllables . So that his pleasure at having understood what Amedee had just said was all the more intense . He remembered what pare meant . It was slang , argot , and he understood it . Aside from its usual meaning of " pear " it also meant " sucker . " He looked at Amedee and laughed with that rather exaggerated laughter which people who are uncertain of themselves in a language display in order to show that they fully appreciate the witty shadings of what has just been said . " Des poires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . " Eh ! " saidAme &e.; " Evidemment ... " He made a weary gesture toward the antique shop . " Tout ca c'est truque . C'est faux . " His voice rose gradually . " C'est fait en sdrie , quoi . " So all that was false , turned out wholesale . . . . Mr. Wright laughed again . Turning toward the store , he caught a glimpse of Mrs. Wright as she swept past the open door , going from one side of the store to the other , carrying some bulky object . His first impulse was to go over and tell her what Amedee had just said , but then he hesitated . If he did that they would n't believe him or , if they did believe him , they probably would n't admit it and would just take out their irritation on him . Of course there was something a little annoying about the idea that it was your money that was being used in the purchase of fake antiques  --  it made you sort of a poise yourself in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then anyway they got such a kick out of it . That was their main pleasure in life , that and visiting churches apparently . So what the hell , Mr. Wright thought . Je m'en fiche. oui ! " Am  --  dee said and went over to the car , where he took out a wrench and began to tighten a bolt on the windshield . Mr. Wright turned his back to the town and leaned on the wall . He looked down at the valley and the distant deep-blue water . The hot sun fell full upon him and the sun and the faint breeze which came up the valley brought out odors from the earth : the smell of ripe oranges , of a plowed field , and from the hillsides a dry sharp smell of spices , of thyme and rosemary and sage . It was early in the afternoon and the town behind him was silent and a great stillness hung also over the valley and the hills . Mr. Wright was still smiling slightly to himself , thinking of the poires . But then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt , only the warmth and the peace of the land about him . Once or twice before on this trip he had had something of the same feeling , a warm presence surrounding him that made him feel , each time that it occurred , that this was worthwhile , this was good . But it was rare . The rest of the time there were only churches and art galleries and a succession of identical over-decorated hotels and contemptuously obsequious head waiters . It was also , he half admitted to himself , rather nice to be alone for a change , without having to be gaspingly articulate in one 's admiration for the cultural wonders of the Old World . He thought for a moment of a stream at home where they used to go trout-fishing , and the damp cool smell of the woods in spring , and of how you could feel the ice cold of the mountain stream as it swept past your waders , with you perfectly dry inside . Standing in the stream you were protected from it but you could feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except at rare moments like this , you had the feeling that you were always insulated from something deep , something vague and unguessed-at but somehow desirable that lay below the cluttered surface of churches , hotels and art galleries . He sighed and climbed up on the wall and sat down . He let his feet hang down over the edge and looked out over the sunlit valley through half-closed eyes . This is good , he thought , this is fine . He took off his hat and raised his face to the sunlight . He started to yawn , deeply and satisfactorily , without covering his mouth with his hand . But just then he heard Mrs. Wright 's voice calling to him and he stopped and turned round . The two women were coming across the square with bundles in their arms and lights in their eyes . " Well , " Mr. Wright said as they came up , " well , did you find some nice things ? " " Lookl " said Mrs. Wright and partly drew aside the wrapping from one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Mr. Wright , looking down at what appeared to be a crockery handle protruding from the wrapping . " You do n't find things like that every day , " said Mrs. Wright . " It 's the real thing , is it ? " Mr. Wright asked . " No fake ? " Mrs. Wright and their daughter looked indignant and both spoke at once rapidly . " Good , " said Mr. Wright . " That 's line . " " Were you bored waiting for us , Daddy ? " Mildred asked " all that time ? " " No , not at all . I just sat here and looked out and . . . " " Now , " said Mrs. Wright as she put the bundles in the car , now we 'll see the church . I read that . . . " " Now , I 'll tell you . . . " Mr. Wright began but Mrs. Wright interrupted him . " This is really a very unusual little church . Hardly any tourists even know about it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there so unusual about it ? " Mr. Wright asked . " In the first place it 's very interesting architecturally . And then there 's the famous silver Virgin there . It does miracles . . . You know , like Lourdes . It 's very old . " " How old ? " Mr. Wright asked . " Well , nobody knows just how old , but from the style they can tell it 's at least .. well , it 's quite primitive . " " Well . . " Mr. Wright began , and wondered to himself just why it was that people who had never before thought much about such things should be expected , immediately upon their arrival in Europe , to take an almost professional interest in ecclesiastical architecture and miraculous images . " It 's supposed to be of solid silver too , " Mildred said . Mr. Wright felt like using that expression which , in the mouths of the younger generation , lie had lately found so irritating , " So what ? " But he merely nodded his head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting . " " Come on , Albert , " Mrs. Wright said and started to walk away . After a few steps she glanced back , from force of habit , expecting to see her husband following at the usual three or four paces behind her . But he had not moved . In fact , he had turned away and was looking out over the valley . " Albert ! " she called , raising her voice rather more than she had intended  --  which annoyed her . He turned his head . " Come on , Daddy , " Mildred said . They both stood facing him , smiling very brightly with their mouths and not at all with their eyes . Mr. Wright leaned . back against the wall and crossed his arms . He smiled too . Indeed , the atmosphere seemed suddenly charged with intense smiling . " Well , I 'll tell you , " he said . " I think I 'll just stay out here for a while . I feel like some fresh air . " He glanced down the valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " A walk ! " The two voices rose sharply , together . Mr. Wright nodded his head , still smiling pleasantly . " Come , Mildred . " Mrs. Wright took her daughter 's arm and with a faint sigh they walked away . Mr. Wright watched them go , then turned again toward the valley . He leaned on the parapet and looked out . He thought again , for no reason that he could see , of the trout stream . From the road below a cloud of red dust rose as some sheep ran across it , driven by a small black excited dog whose barking came up sharp and shrill to where he was standing . There were only a few sheep and they made him think by contrast of the great herds that he had seen out West , in Wyoming and in the high country of Arizona . Everything was on a smaller scale here . Everything was different . But still they were sheep and the dogs barked in the same excited way when they herded them . The red dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the olivetrees that grew by the side of the road . That was a thing that was different  --  olive trees . They did n't have those at home . When the breeze blew it turned up the undersides of the leaves and the whole grove looked silvery , trembling in the wind and the sunlight . In a way it was the same sort of thing you saw on aspen trees . There were a lot of those out West and in the East too , along roads in Connecticut . He turned suddenly and started to walk away from the town on the road that led into the valley . Amedee watched him suspiciously . " ProTnener , " Mr. Wright called to him cheerfully . Amedee pointed to the sun and then to his head and shouted , " Attention aux coups de soleil , hein ? " Mr. Wright nodded , swinging his hat in his hand and striding down the road . Coups de soleil ? " Blows of the sun . , . . " Oh of course : sunstroke . He laughed aloud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly understood a lot of it , and could talk it pretty well  --  when he had the chance . He went on down the road , scuffing the dust with his shoes . Some of it got inside them and it felt warm and dry and pleasant . By the side of the road flowers were growing . He stopped and looked down at them . There were a lot of flowers here that were different from the ones at home . He bent down and picked a small blue one . He looked at it , trying to recall its name . Chicory . That was what they mixed with the coffee over here . The flower grew all over at home . He stuck it in his buttonhole and went on . As he got farther into the valley the town was hidden from him by a bend in the road . Sheltered by the hills , the air was motionless and warmer than it had been up there . The earth smelled dry and the other smells of which before there had been a trace in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The silence was deeper here and the warm still air was filled with a sense of 264 MAGAZINE slow unhurried growth . Walking along , he let his hand brush over some bushes that grew by the road . The dry red dust clung to them . It felt clean . So far he had seen no houses , but after a time he came on one . It was built of stone that was the same color as the earth and the rounded red tiles of its roof were the color of old earth that had baked a long time under this hot southern sun . Above the front door was a grape arbor . The wall behind it was stained blue from the vine-spray . In the shadow made by the broad green leaves of the grapes a man was sitting at a table . He seemed to be asleep . Mr. Wright looked at him for several seconds . It felt suddenly hot out there in the sun and the shade of the arbor looked cool and inviting . The man opened his eyes and half smiled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . The man got to his feet as he came up . Mr. Wright wiped his brow with his handkerchief and smiled and asked for a glass of water . He was embarrassed , but the man seemed to understand him without any difficulty . He pointed to a chair and said , " Asseyezyour ( lulu. , " and went into the house . When he came out with the glass of water the man said something he did n't quite understand , but Mr. Wright said " Eh ! " with an expressive gesture , as he had heard everybody down here saying , and both of them shook their heads and smiled . Then for a moment Mr. Wright felt embarrassed again and almost regretted having stopped here , but when the man began to talk he understood really quite a lot of what he was saying and whenever he said anything the man seemed to understand him as well , so that in a few minutes he felt quite at home here , sitting with this man in the shade of the grape arbor . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was very hot . The man asked Mr. Wright if it was true that there were Indians in New York and Mr. Wright said there were n't but that out West there were still many Indians and he told him about the In-dians in New Mexico and Arizona and about the size of the herds of sheep and cattle out there . That made him think of the time he had sat on the porch of a ranch house after he had stopped to get some water for the car and talked with the fellow that owned it and then had a drink with him , and how it had felt as evening came on , the sun setting on the vast country , and the cool breeze coming up the stars coming out , and how he had finally telephoned back to the dude ranch where they were staying and told Mrs. Wright that the car had broken down and that he 'd have to spend the night there , but not to worry , that he was all right and that he 'd be back early in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been good , and he 'd never forget it . He smiled at the man and looked up at the arbor above their heads . The grapes were hanging down in thick ripe clusters , shining in the shade of the leaves as if with some inner light of their own . They made him realize that autumn was not far off and that soon they would be going home . For a long time , while walking through churches or art galleries he had been looking forward to that time but now , sitting here in the shade , in the warmth , for the first time he regretted it . It was as though , having just arrived in a place toward which for a long while he had been traveling , he were suddenly told that it was already time to leave . He said something to the man about the grapes and the man got up suddenly and went into the house . When he came back he was carrying another glass and a pitcher of wine . Mr. Wright wanted to say something polite about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't seem to be able to form the sentence properly so he just smiled , feeling rather foolish and helpless . The man poured the wine and they touched glasses . After they had taken a sip of the wine the man looked at Mr. Wright expectantly . " Tres bon , " Mr. Wright said . " Tres , fres bon . " He thought of the rich taste of the rye whiskey , sitting out there on the ranch-house porch , feeling the cool evening wind come up the canyon . He thought also of the dry fruity taste of the applejack that they used to get at the farmer 's place after they had been trout fishing and the nasal voice of the farmer and the funny drawling things he used to say as they sat there on his porch in the late spring twilight , and the sound of the stream and the smell of the plowed earth . " Merveilleux , " he said , and took another sip of the wine . The man asked him if he was here alone and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter , who had gone to the church to see the silver Virgin . The man gave a short laugh . He hesitated a moment then asked Mr. Wright if he was very religious . Mr. Wright shrugged his shoulders expressively . The man smiled and , leaning a little forward across the table , said , " Eh , bier . . . your saves . . . tout ca .. ce machin-1a ... c'est faux . " He nodded his head . " Eh , oui ! " Mr. Wright looked at him . " False ? The Virgin ? " The man nodded his head again vigorously and began to tell a long and very complicated story about the silver Virgin . Apparently some stranger , a cousin , it was rumored , of the King of Spain or the King of Italy  --  he was n't sure  --  had come to town and had persuaded the parish priest , for a handsome consideration , to substitute a modern silver-gilt copy for the real silver Virgin , which was then removed at dead of night and sold for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had eventually been detected and the priest unfrocked , but meanwhile the cousin of the King of Spain , or Italy , had disappeared , leaving behind him only an unpaid hotel bill and an accurate but nevertheless spurious replica of the original miraculous Virgin . It was , the man said , a scandale . " Well , I 'll be damned , " said Mr. Wright in English and , leaning back in his chair , began to laugh heartily . The man laughed too . Of course , he said presently , they later declared that the cousin of the King of Spain , or of Italy , had been caught and the original statue restored to the church . But who could tell ? Naturally they would say that , to avoid further scandale ; but who could be sure ? He leaned toward Mr. Wright and , pulling clown the lower lid of his eye with his forefinger , peered at him for several seconds with that most skeptical of gestures . Mr. Wright laughed again and thought of the antiques with which their house at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time shaking their heads . The man poured some more wine . " And anyway , " he said after a time , " who can tell about these things ? God , I do n't know . . . " Mr. Wright took a drink of wine and agreed with him . The man looked up at the leaves above his head . The sun came through a space between them and fell on his face . " But that , " he said , pointing his finger toward the sun , " that 's one thing " ? he turned toward Mr. Wright --  " that and the rain , hein ? " " Yes , " Mr. Wright said . " I do n't know , " the man said . " Of course for women .. . " " Yes , " Mr. Wright said again . " Ahl " The man slapped his hand on the table , got up , and went into the house , taking the empty wine pitcher with him . " Oh , no , vraiment , " Mr. Wright called after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . After he had gone in his laugh still sounded in the warm motionless air . Mr. Wright thought of the laugh of the man on the porch of the ranch-house and the sound of laughter coming from the bunk-house in the evening . He thought of the snort of the old guy who made the applejack . He thought of the cold water of the trout stream and the new buds of the trees . He looked up and saw the heavy purple grapes hanging above his head . He saw the sun and the shadow . The earth ? was quiet . The earth was small and round and quiet . In some places the distances were vast and in others they were small . A place like this was sheltered and warm and still , while there were other places where the wind and the waves blew in from three thousand miles of wild and open ocean . But the wind blew and the rains fell . The man came out of the open doorway with a new pitcher of wine . This is good , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was the sound of a car coming noisily down the road . He gave a start and sat up straighter . It seemed to him that he recognized the sound of the car and for a moment he thought of getting under the table and hiding , but just then the car came into view . Am  --  dee was crouched down over the wheel like a racing driver , his mustaches streaking back from his face in the wind . Perhaps , Mr. Wright thought , he 'll go on . But a second later Amedee saw him and the car drew to a stop in a whirl of dust and with a hideous grinding of brakes . Mr. Wright got slowly to his feet . The man looked up at him inquiringly . " Ma female , " Mr. Wright said , gesturing toward the car . He walked slowly toward it , already hearing the words before they emerged , knowing the sound of them before hearing them . " . . where on earth you had gone . . . Am6dec said . . . no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if we 're to get there on time we 've got to hurry .... " " Get where ? " Mr. Wright asked . " Why , to the Cramers ' tea of course . At the Casino . " " The Cramers ? " Mr. Wright repeated slowly . " Those nice people from the boat . You remember . " " Oh , yes , yes , of course . " Mr. Wright paused a moment . " Well , I 'll tell you , I think I 'll just hang around here for awhile longer . You go ahead , but I think Mrs. Wright leaned forward and opened the door . Mr. Wright looked down at it , then closed it again gently . " Yes , " he said , " Amedee can come back for me this evening . I was just having a nice talk with this fellow  --  this man back there . " Mildred laughed . " But , Daddy , what do you . Fay to your friend ? Do you just sit there ? You know your French is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 011 , we get along , " Mr. Wright said , smiling . " We get along all right . " Mrs. Wright stared down at him , clutching her purchases to her bosom . " Really , I never heard of . . " " How was the . . " Mr. Wright began , then stopped and laughed " What ? " said Mrs. Wright . " The . . . " he laughed again . " The Virgin . . . the solid-silver Virgin ? " She looked down at him intently . " I think Daddy 's tight , " Mildred said , laughing . " No , just a little wine , " he said . " Just a little red wine . ? . du pays . " Amedee was looking at him sardonically . Mr. Wright frowned at him and said abruptly , " Revenez pour moi ce soir , Cornprenez ? " " Bien , monsieur , " Am6:14e said , and suddenly he touched his cap with what seemed almost like a gesture of respect . " Well , " Mr. Wright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Have a good time . " " Really , Albert , " Mrs. Wright said . " What are we going to tell . . . " " Oh , yes , " he said , turning back again smiling , " how was the silver Virgin ? You did n't say . " " Wonderful of course , " Mrs. Wright said . " Very unusual . " " So I heard , " Mr. Wright said . " So they tell me . " " It was extremely worth while , " Mrs. Wright said . " But apparently you 're not interested in things like that . Heaven knows why anyone should bother to come to Europe if they do n't even care enough to . ? . " " Well , so long , " Mr. Wright said , raising his hand . " Take it easy , Momma . " He turned and went back to the house . The man looked up at him . Mr. Wright sat down with a sigh . " Eh , oui ! " he said . The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They drank . A faint breeze came round the corner of the house . It smelt of spices , of rosemaryand thyme , and sage . The sun shone through small spaces between the grape leaves and the grapes themselves glowed with their soft inner light . Mr. Wright looked at the man . " They 're coming back ? " the man said , glancing in the direction in which the car had gone . Mr. Wright smiled and shook his head slowly . " Non . " He looked reflectively down into his glass of wine . " ft m'en fiche , " he added .
