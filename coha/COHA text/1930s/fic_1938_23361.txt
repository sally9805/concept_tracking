A MAN GETS TO THINKING A STORY BY JAMES R. ASWELL . w itEN the rain is corning down like it is to-day and the water 's rattling it-sell against the window glass and the ditches and sinks are lipping over full , a man gets to thinking . A lots of times I think about Old Jeems Crewden and his ark he built . For that 's a thing I 'll remember to my dying clay . Now Old Jeems Crewden was a crazy old man , but not crazy enough that you 'd need to lock him up . No , he cropped his shares with the rest of us here on Mister Ben Lauderdale 's place at Crowny Point and I vow he done as good as the next one . No , it was only when he come to talking about high water that his head got to where it could n't plow a straight furrow . Well , all of us living in the low ground do a heap of thinking about high water . Just any old morning we 're liken to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off of our front doorsills in the back-over from the river . So we study off and on more than most about the high-rising waters . But it was n't off and on with Old Jeems . He could n't think and he could n't talk about nothing else . I declare to my soul he could n't . Why it 's no wonder . Old Jeems near died in the high water that come back in nineteen twenty and seven . He lost his old wife and his mule and every hog and chicken he had to his name . His house was washed away in the night and hint in it . Well , this rescue boat that come along found him sitting on the roof about two ticks and a wink before it turned a loosefrom the snag it was holding to and started rolling somersaults in the current . So Old Jeems liken to died of the pneumonia . And when he got up and around and they told him his old wife was gone , well , it went all over him . It gave his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't plowing or chopping cotton or something that kept him dog-tired , he was studying about high water . He went roaming from house to house talking about how it would come again one of these days . " The world is too mean , " he said . " The Lord is not a going to stand for it much longer . It 's coming a flood and we 'll all be washed away down clear to New Orlins , " he said . " Maybe a high water , " we said , " but not no flood . A high water is just the river running over , but a flood is the whole world drownded . And the Book says it 's fire the next time the whole world is too mean . " Old Jeems just shook his head . " It 's a flood a coming , I tell you , " he said , " a flood of cleansing waters . It will tear into Memphis and all them towns . It will wash away those radios and automobiles and these hussy-gals that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will come here . And it will clean away all we owes to Mister Ben 's commissary and all the plaguing vermins too . I hear that water rising , rising in my head . It 's like a storm of wind a coming up . Louder and louder ! Ca n't you hear it coming , brother ! Ca n't you hear it coming ? " You could n't laugh at Old Jeems , not even if you wanted to . His eyes got so big and shiny and he 'd hold out his arms begging you to listen and the tears would run down his dry wrinkled old face . " Take heed , " he said . " Oh , take heed ! " Sometimes he would n't say a thing but just hold out his arms and shake and cry . You could tell what he meant all the same . Now a preacher  --  you take preachers . They will talk a heap like Old Jeems . But it 's about Judgment Day and a lots of other things . It 's about gambling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old days . That 's when they 're preaching . Well , let a preacher step down out of the pulpit and then what ? Why he 's just like anybody else almost . He will tell a joke about his wife and maybe he will pinch a gal like anybody else , and eat like any ficldhand . Oki Jeems Crewden never come down out of his pulpit and he never talked about but that one thing . Flood a coming . He just stuck to it . The notion of the ark took Old Jeems three years ago . It come on him all of a sudden and he left his mule a standing in the middle of his fall garden patch plowing . Well , we did n't know what to do . We unhitched that mule and put her in the stable but nobody would say a word to Old Jeems . He 'd lit off across the slew to where an old coal barge had drifted into away back in the fields during the high water in nineteen twenty and seven . That old barge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindling wood and it was all full of hard mud . Anyhow Old Jeems went to work . He cleaned out that mud and he stole a barrel of tar from where they was running a highway seven miles back from the river . And he took the tar and poured it in the open cracks betwixt the shrunk boards of the old barge . But he did n't stop there . No , he tore down his chicken house and part of his old stable . He toted the lumber across the slew and he built a crazyhouse on that old barge away back in the fields . Well , Old Jeems did n't say one word to us about what he was doing and we did n't say a word to him . What can you say to such a carrying-on man ? When the Lord takes and flaws a man 's brains , it 's mighty unlucky to cross that man in anything . Besides , we was all scared of little bits of a dried-up Old Jeems Crewden . Every day somebody just left some fatback or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't bother him . He did n't come around talking about flood a coming no more and seems like he 'd forgot we was still living . By the time the first cold winter rains was beginning to pour down Old Jeems had got his ark fixed to suit him . And next thing you know we was seeing the poor old man slopping and miring around near the slew getting him some cane and willow . " Oh , " we said , " what do you reckon that poor old man 's up to now ? " Well , he was n't studying fishing poles with them canes and he was n't aiming to weave baskets with the willow . He had cages on his mind . Yes , he was going to make cages for birds and rabbits and snakes . 1 do n't know but I guess he aimed to make cages for cows and mules and all later . He must have thought he was Noah , that poor crazy old man . So Old Jeems caught his death , caught the pneumonia again from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house he 'd built on his ark . We did n't find him till two or maybe three days afterward . All we could do then was bury him and feel sorry . Way I looked at it , I did n't feel sorry for Old Jeems dying . Oh , maybe he was in pain and misery a few hours while he lay dying . But it got over pretty quick when you match it against the long years he 'd been on this earth . Because what I grieved about was his life . Yes , it 's dead people 's lives that hurts me . That 's the way it is with me . Now Old Jeems was born and he was a boy and then a man  --  a hard-working A MAN GETS boy and a hard-working man . Well , he married a wife and they had young ones . They all worked hard , had to . You 've got to work hard to just live . And one thing or another happened to Old Jeems ' young ones and they died . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible . Then in his old age his wife was drownded and Old Jeems got to thinking he was Noah and had to build him an ark . So it was his life that ached me . When he died I was glad , for I liked Old Jeems the best kind . I think about all that when I 'm sitting here and it 's raining . And I had to remember Old Jeems when the rain got into me last winter . Oh , it rained last winter . It was days and solid pouring down weeks . It rained till you could n't see to the lye-bin . It rained till you could n't hear yourself think , till you was n't hungry , till you hated your wife and your young ones . It rained till it was like hammers a beating on your head and you wanted to tear off your clothes and run and howl . Yes , it rained then . I went down to the slew . It looked bad , but I did n't worry . If it risen up five feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scum water for our bed covers . But I did n't worry . I knowed what to do . I would take my stuff and throw it in some grass sacks and me and my wife and my young ones would just slowfoot it to the high ground to the big house . And everybody else would do the same . We knowed what to do . I reckon it was two nights after that . Maybe it was three . I waken up . I could hear water going some place . I could hear it slapping against my house . The bed felt unrestless under me . I got up and I lit my lantern . Well , it was a lot of water outside and it was in a hurry . But it was n't coming from the slew . No , it was bound for the slew . It was all ruffled up and rushing along . Sonic place up the river a levee was broke . The water was coming at us from the back in the middle of the night . I waken up my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get nothing . We run and we hollered till we just waken everybody in all the houses . And that water was coming higher every living minute . I saw we could n't make it to the high ground like we most of us done in nineteen twenty and seven when the river backed over in the slew . I saw we would all be drownded before we could get a mile on our way . We couldn't. make it . I was n't scared . I just felt lloaty . I felt like I had the fevers . " Well , " I says to myself , " Old Jeems was right . It is a flood this time . " It minded me of the ark Old Jeems built . So all of a sudden I knowed that old coal barge of an ark was the only chance . It was crazy . It maybe would n't ride in the water . But it was the only chance . So them that could swim pulled the others across the slew . We splashed through the high-rising water in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rain poured and stung you in the face . You could n't see a thing , and we did n't fetch a single lantern across that slew . Could n't . You 've got to swim with your hands and the water was stout a running down the slew towards the river . But we got to OM Jeems ' ark by the hardest . We dim up on it and we just waited . It was the best we could do . Whcn the water risen a little more we felt that old ark a moving . Yes , it swung this way and it swung that way . And it was floating . Because Old Jeems had done a mightily good job with that stole barrel of tar . The barge did n't leak hardly at all . Way it was , we could n't see to pole the barge . Even if we had some poles we could n't see . And we could n't pole against the strong current anyhow . We had to sit there and let Old Jeems ' ark go where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time it pushed us out of the fields and down the old slew and out in the flooding river . And the river took us along . But we did n't talk . No , we could n't talk , for too much had come on us . We sat shivering and a dripping in the ark and we looked at the river all yellow and boiling with current and lonesome everywhere around us . And the water made a steady sound like a storm of wind at night when you pull the cover tight around your head . It was a far-off feeling and such a little feeling you got away out on that flooding river . Well , I got to thinking what Old Jeems Crewden used to say about a flood a coming from the Lord . I got to thinking about the Lord 's ways . Now a man will just do a thing for nothing . He will sit around . He will whittle a cedar stick . He will argue with his wife and he will throw a dirt clod at a tree . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Why every single time a bird comes down off of a limb and starts to pecking in the grass the Lord is behind that bird . He 's got a purpose in that bird . The same way with everything else . The Lord 's behind it . He 's aiming it at something . Now Old Jeems seemed like a poor crazy old man . He built him an ark out of an old coal barge . It looked like a crazy thing for a man to do . But the high water took us in the back at Crowny Point . We run to the ark and we did n't get drownded . The ark was ready and waiting . There was a purpose in Old Jeems building it . Oh , I thought about it . And I felt weak and I shaken and I trembled . The Lord had laid his hand on us and we was saved from the high-rising waters . So it was a good time coming . After the water went down it would he a good time and the Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord 's not like a man . He do n't do a thing just for nothing . Then the rescue boat come along and took us clear to Memphis and we was rivergees . There was a power of river-gees crowding at Memphis and getting fed . And when the high water was over , Mister Ben took us home to Crowny Point . Well , Mister Ben got some flood money from the government and we built our houses better than ever . And we got new mules to plow . Yes , it looked like a good time at last . We put the cotton in and it growed like I never saw old cotton grow before . It was so much cotton and so fine that I could n't hardly believe it . I knew we would be rich . I would get my wife every last thing she wanted . I would pay Mister Ben all I owed him . I would get pretties for my young ones . Every day I would eat me some of them big grapefruits like they gave me when I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like crying and I shaken in my shoes . So we picked our crop and we took it to the gin . It sure looked like the good time had come . F ! Now it 's this way with cotton . The more it is and the better it gets , the worse for the man that grows it . A good crop 's a bad crop . But a bad crop 's not a good one . What happened is that Mister Ben just had to get hard on us because it was too much cotton . I reckon the banker men got hard on Mister Ben . And we ca n't hardly get a thing from the commissary store no more . So I sit here watching the rain and I get to thinking . I look at my wife and I look at my young ones . It hurts me to look . I think of all the years I 've been working for Mister Ben . I think of my daddy working for Mister Ben and his daddy working for Mister Ben 's daddy . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think about how the Lord made Old Jeems Crewden his vessel and how he turned Old Jeems to making an ark out of an old coal barge and how it saved us from the high water . And I do n't see why the Lord done it .
