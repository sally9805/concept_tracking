At Pogranichnaya , a frontier station on the Chinese Eastern Railway , a patrol of Japanese troops wandered about 1,000 yards into Soviet territory . By the time they had fought their way back to their own side of the fence one Japanese lieutenant and two Japanese soldiers were dead . <P> In Tokyo four wild-eyed young men , members of one of Japan 's patriotic societies ( Kenkokukai ) invaded the offices of the Soviet Tass News Agency , attempted to bluff Red reporters into leaving the country . Around the Soviet embassy Japanese police set a close guard , arrested Japanese interpreters , Japanese language teachers and other Japanese employes on suspicion of espionage , opened parcels . Announced Moscow 's Izvestia : " The Japanese attitude toward the embassy of a foreign state is unprecedented in civilized countries . " <P> Such were last week 's manifestations of the continuing crisis between Japan and Russia . Meanwhile Japanese statesmen had something even more serious to worry about . News leaked out that the Soviet Government had just concluded a secret treaty with China 's Nanking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be attacked by Japan . <P> At Nanking Japanese Consul General Yakichiro Suma hustled around to the Chinese Foreign Office to protest . With a face blandly childlike the Nationalist Foreign Minister , General Chang Chun , insisted that not only was there no truth in this story but that the Nationalist Government had sent a sharp note to Moscow protesting the Soviet-Mongolian agreement as a breach of Russia 's 1924 pledge recognizing China 's sovereignty over Outer Mongolia . <P> Tokyo wiseacres were not impressed . Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalist Government dare not admit an agreement with Russia , for a great proportion of the Chinese Dictator 's power comes from the Western world 's belief that he and his regime are the chief bulwarks against Communism in Eastern <P> China . Yet the generalissimo has accepted Russian money before , and his Foreign Minister Chang Chun was once a member of the Canton Revolutionary Government . <P> Bland General Chang Chun has very little to do with formulating China 's foreign policy . A multi-millionaire many times over , his vast fortune comes from the international opium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This has given him no Chinese stigma , for General Chang also controls the Bank of <P> Communications , a poor man 's institution that has put branches in almost every city in China and is implicitly trusted by little Chinese farmers and shopkeepers . His presence in the Foreign Office is due to the fact that Japanese tycoons , strongest check to Japanese militarists , trust him too . <P> A secret Chinese agreement with Russia would put a quietus on the Nationalist Government 's none too successful campaign against Chinese Communists in the Central provinces , release thousands of well-equipped troops for use against Japan in the North . Even more important than military advantage to Russia would be the possibility of cutting into the rich Chinese markets now held by Japan and Britain . Reports of the military alliance were last week quickly followed by a rumor that the U. S. S. R. and China were dickering over a commercial agreement .
