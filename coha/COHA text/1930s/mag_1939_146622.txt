Each Dawn I Die ( Warner Bros. - First National ) winks at the Hays Code , which frowns on teaching cinemaddicts how to commit crimes , by illustrating a practically foolproof way to commit one . When Frank Ross ( James Cagney ) , a fresh reporter , presses too close to the racketeers running his home town , the boys slug him , douse him with whiskey , prop him behind the steering wheel of a car and head it toward a crowded intersection . The result starts Jimmy off on a long term for manslaughter and gives Fellow Prisoner Hood Stacey ( George Raft ) his opportunity to meet " the first really square guy I 've ever known . " It also touches off the most authentic and exciting prison picture since The Big House ( 1930 ) , one of the noisiest sound tracks ever heard outside an airplane epic , enough slugging , shooting , bullyragging and brutality to make the most hardened criminal think twice before tangling with the law . <P> In addition to its crackling screen play ( by Norman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , its sharp camera eye ( Warners ' Director William Keighley ) , Each Dawn I Die is made memorable by the easy mastery of its two principals . Cinemactors Cagney and Raft , the screen 's two deadliest Ruffie MacTuffies , have been friends ever since they began their careers as vaudeville hoofers in Manhattan in the 205 . Cagney was responsible for one of Raft 's earliest cinema parts , a dancing bit in Cagney 's Taxi . Their appropriate reunion , also celebrating their return to the gangster movies where they belong , is a fierce slugfest in handcuffs . <P> Winter Carnival ( United Artists-Walter Wanger ) . Ann Sheridan , born Clara Lou Sheridan in Dallas , Tex . 24 years ago , left college for Hollywood when she won a Paramount " Search for Beauty " contest in her neighborhood in 1933 . After two years on the Paramount payroll , during which she failed to set any celluloid on fire , she was dropped , spent a year looking for a job . Warner Bros , put her under contract in 1936 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollywood of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer 's glamorous Hedy Lamarr , started circulating glamorous photographs of Ann Sheridan , her red hair dyed a shade lighter than life , her teeth in permanent caps , her nubile curves seductively displayed . Although her most ambitious job of work since then has been an unimpressive performance in an unimpressive picture called Indianapolis Speedway , Warners ' smart young West Coast publicity chief , Bob Taplinger , has made her one of movieland 's brightest extracurricular celebrities . <P> Los Angeles ' swank Town House staged , at Warners ' instigation , a dinner for 26 males who decided she had more " oomph " ' than any girl in town . " Oomph , " said Dudley Field Malone , " is a very beautiful thing that convention demands be clothed . " Said Screenwriter Graham Baker : " Oomph is something in a girl which begets propositions not proposals , gets her chased instead of chaste . " As the Oomph Girl , Cinemactress Sheridan was more photographed , talked about , gossip-columned than any recognized Hollywood star .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
