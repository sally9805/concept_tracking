Time : Late afternoon  --  a Saturday in June . Place : The terrace room in IRENE BURROUGHS ' house in the country . The room was obviously once a terrace  --  and has been enclosed with glass . One wall  --  at back  --  is old brick  --  painted white . There are splotches of very thick paint and dark patches where the paint has worn thin . A door at center of this wall was once an outside entrance and leads into the house through a hall . At either side of the door are green wooden tubs in which ivy is growing . The ivy straggles gracefully over the wall  --  unevenly and decoratively  --  making a cool soft background to the room . Long wide windows  --  in the glass wall at right  --  open onto an outer terrace  --  giving the room the effect of being very much outdoors . A medium grand piano in light wood is in the upper right corner . Smart garden furniture covered in gay chintz  --  flowers and bright cushions make the room luxuriously inviting . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outer terrace at right  --  followed by MICHAEL O'HARA . IRENE is perhaps thirty-seven . Her good looks depend largely upon her good grooming . Incisive in voice and manner  --  she is restless  --  dissatisfied and hard  --  but nevertheless an extremely attractive woman . MICHAEL O'HARA is about thirty-five  --  tall  --  dark and good-looking  --  with a slightly indolent manner and great charm . They are both wearing good riding clothes  --  old and comfortable . IRENE BURROUGHS ( as she comes in  --  warm and tired  --  but exhilarated ) Oo-ie ! Three hours ! Not so bad . Will you have a dish of tea  --  you Irishman  --  or whiskey ? ( She goes directly to ring the bell at right of the center door. ) p. 3 MICHAEL O'HARA ( strolling in after IRENE ) Both . I 've got a three hour thirst . IRENE BURROUGHS ( pulling off her gloves ) Mike  --  MICHAEL O'HARA Speaking . ( He sits on the end of the long chair down right  --  to take off his spurs . ) IRENE BURROUGHS When Susan gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean ? Careful of what ? IRENE BURROUGHS What do you s'pose I mean  --  you goat . MICHAEL O'HARA Oh .  --  I thought you did n't care  --  who knows . IRENE BURROUGHS Susan will guess anyway . She said before she went away  --  " I 'll bet you and Mike do n't wait for your divorce  --  I bet you 're living together by the time I get back . " MICHAEL O'HARA Well , why do n't you beat her to it and say  --  You win  --  the minute she arrives ? ( Throwing himself full length in the chair . ) IRENE BURROUGHS I consider myself much more married to you  --  now  --  than I ever did to Fred or Tom . If Tom had given me my divorce right away things would n't be  --  as they are . ( She sits on the upper arm of MIKE 'S chair. ) p. 4 MICHAEL O'HARA Are you apologizing to me , darling  --  because things are  --  as they are ? ( Kissing the palm of her hand . ) IRENE BURROUGHS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  what it does to me  --  it 's right  --  right  --  right ! ( She goes to the couch at left  --  stretching herself out on it comfortably . ) I 'm not apologizing to anybody . My life 's my own affair . I 'll tell Susan when I 'm ready to . Hello , Charlotte  --  you look like a lobster . ( CHARLOTTE MARLEY is a healthy out-doorsie woman  --  about thirty-five  --  with the magnetism of vitality and good nature . She is wearing white shorts  --  carries a tennis racket and has a colored handkerchief tied about her head . ) CHARLOTTE MARLEY ( coming in from the terrace and taking the handkerchief off her head to wipe her hot face ) I feel like a crab ! They licked the pants off of Stubbie and me . ( LEEDS , a well-set-up butler , comes in from the hall  --  carrying a large tray of liquor , ice , glasses , etc. , which he places on the table which is against the wall at left of the center door . ) MICHAEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell me you let the actor beat you , Stubbie ! ( LEONORA STUBBS comes in from the terrace . She is a tall , beautiful woman , about twenty-eight  --  quite honest and unaffected in manner . She is wearing white shorts  --  carries her skirt over one arm and a tennis racket in her hand. ) p. 5 HUTCHINS STUBBS I ca n't possibly play my game with that sort of person . ( Throwing his racket under the piano . ) Why have you got him here , Irene ? LEONORA STUBBS Why do you hate the poor old theatre so , darling ?  --  Did n't I give it all up  --  for love of you ? ( CLYDE ROCHESTER comes in from the terrace . He is about twenty-seven . Fairly good-looking in a fresh , healthy way  --  with a laugh and a cheerfulness very irritating to the uncheerful . He is dressed for tennis and carries a racket . ) HUTCHINS STUBBS And you 're supposed to have given up theatre people  --  when you married me . ( Looking at CLYDE with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he wanted to bat Clyde over the head instead of the ball . ( She sinks into the big chair in which MIKE has been sitting . ) Oh  --  but you 've got good chairs in your house , Irene . ( CHARLOTTE is at the table making a highball . ) MICHAEL O'HARA We hear you 're pretty good , Clyde . CLYDE ROCHESTER It was n't that I was so good  --  but  --  p. 6 HUTCHINS STUBBS ( staring at him ) But that I was so rotten . CLYDE ROCHESTER ( cheerfully ) I believe you said you were off your game today , Mr. Stubbs . HUTCHINS STUBBS I had a very good reason for being off . CHARLOTTE MARLEY This is for Leonora . ( She comes to the two men with a highball . CLYDE reaches for it but STUBBIE takes the glass giving it to LEONORA . ) LEONORA STUBBS Thanks , darling . ( CLYDE sits at the piano and begins playing popular music . ) HUTCHINS STUBBS What about Susan , Irene ?  --  Where is she ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) LEONORA STUBBS Do n't tell me the lady is n't coming after all  --  I could n't bear it . IRENE BURROUGHS I do n't know where she is . She 's changed her mind three times now . MICHAEL O'HARA ( strolling about with his drink ) Susan does n't change her mind  --  she changes her emotions . p. 7 IRENE BURROUGHS Has she phoned again , Charlotte ? CHARLOTTE MARLEY No  --  but Barrie phoned to see if she was here . IRENE BURROUGHS What did you tell him ? CHARLOTTE MARLEY Nothing ! IRENE BURROUGHS If he phones again  --  tell him she is n't coming . CHARLOTTE MARLEY ( coming down with a drink in her hand and sitting on the right end of the couch with her feet up on a chair ) You can do your own lying next time , darling  --  you 're an expert . MICHAEL O'HARA You ca n't tell Barrie Susan is n't coming , Irene . ( STUBBIE comes from the table with a drink in his hand and starts to climb over Charlotte 's feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gives him a little kick as he goes by her . STUBBIE goes on and sits by IRENE on the couch . ) IRENE BURROUGHS ( drawing up her feet to make room for STUBBIE ) Certainly I can . I will not have them both in my house at the same time . I 've had enough of that . There 'd be the same old scene and row . I adore them  --  but not when they 're together . p. 8 MICHAEL O'HARA Do n't worry . Barrie will be too tight to show up . CHARLOTTE MARLEY No  --  why worry about your happy married friends ?  --  You 're all so sorry for me . " Poor old Charlotte  --  No man ! " I 'm going to write a best seller  --  " Sleep Alone and Like It . " MICHAEL O'HARA That 's no sign you do , darling . IRENE BURROUGHS What did Barrie say when he phoned , Charlotte ? CHARLOTTE MARLEY He did n't even know Susan had landed to-day  --  till he had a wire from the boat  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the couch and sitting in a chair by the table at center . ) IRENE BURROUGHS If she had let him meet her at the boat  --  he would have arrived with the biggest bunch of flowers in the world  --  tight . CHARLOTTE MARLEY She told him to meet her at Blossom 's school  --  and when he got there Blossom had had another wire from her mother saying she was coming here first . Now they do n't know where she is.  --  I call it rotten . MICHAEL O'HARA ( taking a drink to CLYDE who is still playing ) Foolish faithful old Barrie . If he 'd only get another gal  --  Susan would snap back like a shot . p. 9 IRENE BURROUGHS When I talked to her on the phone she said she had something tremendously important to tell us . What do you s'pose it is ? HUTCHINS STUBBS The divorce , I hope . Their existence  --  as is  --  is absurd . LEONORA STUBBS What 's the matter with them ? MICHAEL O'HARA Nothing  --  only they 're both a little too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money and never had to work for it . CLYDE ROCHESTER That is tough . ( Leaving the piano and sitting on the floor below LEONORA 'S chair . ) LEONORA STUBBS What 's Susan 's trouble ? HUTCHINS STUBBS Too much charm . Life has never disciplined her at all . IRENE BURROUGHS Susan 's the most intelligent fool I 've ever known . HUTCHINS STUBBS I 've never been sure whether Barrie drinks because Susan 's tired of him  --  or Susan 's tired of him because he drinks . ( CHARLOTTE and MIKE both speak at once  --  their voices rising as each insists on his reason as to why BARRIE drinks. ) p. 10 CHARLOTTE MARLEY Because she 's tired of him , of course . MICHAEL O'HARA She would n't be tired of him if he were n't so much in love with her . Barrie 's a fool about Susan . IRENE BURROUGHS ( speaking above the others until they listen to her ) No matter why he drinks  --  he does drink like a fish . MICHAEL O'HARA Worst fighter I ever saw . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . IRENE BURROUGHS He 's adorable when he is n't drinking  --  and impossible when he is . No woman could stand it . You ca n't blame Susan for being tired of it and staying away so long . CHARLOTTE MARLEY But Susan gets tired of everything . When Blossom was a baby  --  there never was another baby . Now she 's bored stiff with her . IRENE BURROUGHS Poor kid  --  she 's at the terribly unattractive age . Susan 's going to die when she sees her . CLYDE ROCHESTER Seems to be a very sad case . HUTCHINS STUBBS ( staring rudely at CLYDE ) We 're speaking of intimate friends whom you do n't know I believe . p. 11 CHARLOTTE MARLEY ( protecting CLYDE ) I 'll show you where the pool is , Clyde . I know you 'd like a cold dip . MICHAEL O'HARA Do n't go , Charlotte . I love your legs . CHARLOTTE MARLEY So do I.  --  They 're all I 've got ! ( CHARLOTTE goes out at right  --  CLYDE following her . ) MICHAEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlotte ever did give a damn about any man it 's Barrie . IRENE BURROUGHS ( picking up her hat and crop from the floor ) That 's why she 's so hard on Susan . I 'm going to get out of these togs . Now if Barrie should get here first  --  you 've got to tell him Susan is n't coming . SUSAN TREXEL ( calling from outside ) You darlings  --  you darlings  --  you darlings ! ( They all rise eagerly  --  calling back to SUSAN as she comes in . SUSAN TREXEL is thirty-five  --  a woman with so much charm that it covers most of her faults  --  most of the time  --  for most people . She is slender and alert and pretty  --  with a very individual style and chic . Just now she is delightful in a new spring Paris creation . The others respond at once to her excited pleasure in seeing them. ) p. 12 SUSAN TREXEL ( opening her arms to IRENE and going to her ) Irene darling ! This is too wonderful ! It is  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Oh , I 'm glad to see you ! ( They embrace each other with real affection . ) SUSAN TREXEL ( breathlessly ) How perfect you look ! You always do ! Stubbie  --  darling ! How marvelous ! ( She turns to STUBBIE who has come near and kisses his cheek  --  wiping her lip rouge from his cheek at once as a matter of course . ) MICHAEL O'HARA ( coming to SUSAN ) Next . SUSAN TREXEL Michael my sweet ! MICHAEL O'HARA Right in the mouth and nothing wiped off . ( He kisses SUSAN 'S lips . ) SUSAN TREXEL Mike  --  you have got a way with you . How nice ! ( Starting to kiss LEONORA and then realizing that she does n't know her . ) Oh  --  sorry  --  but I 'm so glad to see anybody . p. 13 IRENE BURROUGHS Of course  --  you do n't know each other . This is Leonora Stubbs  --  Susan . HUTCHINS STUBBS In other words my wife . SUSAN TREXEL Your first wife ! How wonderful ! How do you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stubbie was such a bachelor ! I can quite see how you did it ! She 's marvelous , Stubbie ! ( They all begin to sit down again . ) SUSAN TREXEL ( sitting in the chair MIKE has pushed to the center for her ) I did n't mean to do this  --  Irene . I was going straight to Blossom  --  Bless her ! But when you told me who was here I knew it was still more important that I get to you at once . IRENE BURROUGHS It 's great to have you . ( MICHAEL gives SUSAN a highball . ) HUTCHINS STUBBS I never saw you looking better , Susan . You must have been having the time of your life . SUSAN TREXEL Oh  --  it is n't that . I mean not the kind of a time you mean . Oh  --  I forgot  --  take this away , Mike . That 's out . ( Having taken a sip. ) p. 14 MICHAEL O'HARA Do n't tell me you 're on the wagon  --  Susan ! SUSAN TREXEL No  --  not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wagon . CHARLOTTE MARLEY ( coming back from the terrace ) Susan ! Hello  --  hello ! SUSAN TREXEL Charlotte  --  darling !  --  Are you here ! How heavenly ! CHARLOTTE MARLEY You look the way we 're supposed to look when we come from Paris  --  but nobody ever does . SUSAN TREXEL ( rising and going to sit in the large chair at right ) Do you like me ? Oh  --  how sweet  --  sweet  --  sweet it is to be here ! Tell me everything .  --  What 's happened ? What have you been doing , Charlotte ? And how does it seem to be married , Stubbie ? ( STUBBIE starts to speak  --  SUSAN does n't stop . ) I have had the most wonderful experience of my whole life . HUTCHINS STUBBS And how 's the good old Riviera ? SUSAN TREXEL Oh , I 've forgotten it . That is n't what I mean when I say I 've had the most wonderful experience of my whole life . p. 15 CHARLOTTE MARLEY What do you mean then ? SUSAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag for a cigarette ) Well  --  I did n't mean to go to England at all . But I met Lady Wiggam on the Riviera and we got awfully keen about each other  --  and she asked me to go home with her and I thought I might as well sail from  --  She is one of the rarest creatures I have ever known . IRENE BURROUGHS What 's so rare about her ? SUSAN TREXEL ( rushing on excitedly and ceaselessly ) To begin with she 's one of the most distinguished women in England and the most gorgeously magnificent place in Kent to say nothing of all the others  --  but that is n't it . CHARLOTTE MARLEY That is n't why you 're keen about her . SUSAN TREXEL Not at all . It 's her soul that 's developed to such a marvelous  --  For instance , the first night I was there the house was filled with people . I did n't know anybody  --  and I was holding my chin as high as possible and trying to be as insulting to the English as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in  --  and we all loved each other in a minute . p. 16 CHARLOTTE MARLEY What do you mean ? Is she religious  --  or something ? SUSAN TREXEL Oh  --  it 's much more than that . I mean  --  it 's new  --  and fresh and so practical  --  that 's why it appeals to me . IRENE BURROUGHS What appeals to you ? SUSAN TREXEL Why her  --  It is n't hers  --  of course . It 's anybody 's  --  everybody 's . But she began the movement . CHARLOTTE MARLEY ( laughing so she can scarcely speak ) If there 's one thing I thought you 'd never be guilty of  --  Susan  --  it 's a movement . SUSAN TREXEL I know . That 's why it 's so wonderful . You wait . You 'll see . You 'll see . I ca n't even talk about it yet  --  but you can ask me questions .  --  I want to give , give , give all I can  --  to all of you . ( She goes up to the piano to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it  --  if it is n't a religion ? SUSAN TREXEL Well  --  it is  --  in a way  --  but you can keep right on being what you are  --  An Episcopalian  --  or Ethiopian  --  or Catholic or Jew  --  or colored  --  or anything . It 's just love  --  love  --  love  --  for other people  --  not for yourself . p. 17 MICHAEL O'HARA The good old golden rule , you mean . SUSAN TREXEL What is the golden rule  --  exactly , Mike ? HUTCHINS STUBBS Did n't you ever go to Sunday School  --  Susan ? SUSAN TREXEL ( moving to the center of the room  --  where she sits again ) No  --  I was such a sensitive child they did n't make me . That 's why this is so wonderful  --  there is n't any dogma or anything hard to believe about it . That 's why so many intelligent thinking people are interested in it . It 's thrilling and alive and fun  --  so people are n't ashamed to be good . This was the most remarkable collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds . I never heard so many titles  --  all at once  --  in my life  --  and great thinkers  --  you never saw so much thinking  --  and some were just people  --  and some  --  well , practically out of the gutter with the same light shining in their  --  How are the dogs , Charlotte ? CHARLOTTE MARLEY Great . The new litter 's got two bitches and three dogs . I 'm going to get a hundred bucks apiece for the dog pups . That will put a new roof on the shack . p. 18 SUSAN TREXEL Oh  --  does the roof leak ? CHARLOTTE MARLEY Roof and the pups . ( CLYDE comes back through the center entrance and goes to SUSAN . ) IRENE BURROUGHS Susan  --  this is Clyde Rochester  --  Mrs. Trexel . SUSAN TREXEL How do you do  --  Clyde . We all called each other by our first names at Lady Wiggam 's . Lord Ramsdale 's chauffeur called him Tom . It was too sweet . CLYDE ROCHESTER Well then  --  if I may be as bold as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't remember me but I had the pleasure of meeting you when I was playing at Newport two seasons ago . SUSAN TREXEL ( shaking hands with CLYDE enthusiastically ) Oh  --  of course . I remember you perfectly . Are you an actor ? Well  --  there was an actor there too  --  literally anybody . The Duchess of Keating said , " This is a great experience  --  coming into spiritual contact with people we never even knew existed . " I had the most really thrilling and inspiring talk with one of Lady Wiggam 's gardeners . It makes you just open your heart  --  your soul rather  --  to people  --  and he told me one morning in one of the marvelous tulip beds that he used to hate his wife so he got all ready to kill her one night  --  with the gun actually in his hand . ( None of them pretend to control their ribald laughter. ) p. 19 MICHAEL O'HARA Do n't tell me he did n't do it . SUSAN TREXEL No  --  he did n't . CHARLOTTE MARLEY What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off somehow  --  and he knew afterwards  --  after Lady Wiggam had brought him in too  --  he knew it was the hand of God that stopped him . And now he actually likes his wife  --  very much indeed . ( They all shout with laughter and move about a little . SUSAN laughs at herself with them . ) I know . I know . You ca n't believe it because I 'm saying it . But you 'll see how changed I am . Now tell me about yourselves . What have you been doing , Stubbie ? HUTCHINS STUBBS The same old things . How 's Barrie , Susan ? SUSAN TREXEL ( with a quick sigh ) Oh , I hope Barrie 's all right . I hope so . Have any of you seen him lately ? MICHAEL O'HARA I did  --  last week . SUSAN TREXEL How was he ? MICHAEL O'HARA Oh , he was  --  SUSAN TREXEL ( not waiting ) I did n't cable him to meet me at the boat for fear he 'd be  --  you know . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to open the house this summer , Susan ? SUSAN TREXEL ( going up to the piano to get a cigarette and a lighter from her bag ) No  --  it 's so big  --  and such a burden  --  and after all  --  why ? Barrie does n't care a thing about it  --  and Blossom adores the camp . She 'd rather be there than any place . LEONORA STUBBS Where is your place , Mrs. Trexel ? SUSAN TREXEL Oh  --  over there . ( Waving a hand vaguely . ) HUTCHINS STUBBS Only about a mile . SUSAN TREXEL Give me a light , will you please , Clyde ? ( Snapping the lighter which does n't work . ) A divine Frenchman gave me this  --  just before I was leaving . I always had a suspicion he knew it would n't work . CLYDE ROCHESTER ( lighting her cigarette with a match which he takes from a box in his pocket ) Never again for me one of those things .  --  Remember , Leonora ? LEONORA STUBBS ( laughing ) Oh  --  do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene once with Leonora  --  LEONORA STUBBS He was supposed to light my cigarette and say , " When you come into the room , darling , you light a spark in me , just like that . " ( She snaps her fingers like a lighter . ) He kept on snapping the darned thing and nothing happened . SUSAN TREXEL ( looking at LEONORA ) Oh  --  you were on the stage too . How exciting ! Did you and Clyde act together a lot ? LEONORA STUBBS Quite a lot . SUSAN TREXEL You must be terribly flattered , Stubbie  --  that she married you . I mean that she gave up her career for you . HUTCHINS STUBBS Oh  --  enormously . SUSAN TREXEL And how are you going to behave when she gives you up  --  for her career ? LEONORA STUBBS I do n't think Stubbie 's worried much about that . HUTCHINS STUBBS The theatre seems to be getting on very well without Leonora and her career . SUSAN TREXEL But they always go back . Have you got your divorce yet , Irene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 'll be awfully nice for you , Mike  --  but you know  --  I expect this will just wipe divorce right out of the world . MICHAEL O'HARA What will ? SUSAN TREXEL Lady Wiggam 's movement  --  when there are enough of us . You ca n't stop it . It 's marching on like a glorious army . CHARLOTTE MARLEY I 'm dumb . What is it ? What is Lady Wiggam 's movement ? SUSAN TREXEL Why she 's found God , dear  --  in a new way . IRENE BURROUGHS Really , Susan  --  I 'm not very religious  --  but I think it 's irreverent  --  talking about sacred things  --  so flippantly . SUSAN TREXEL It is n't flippant  --  it 's cheerful . You 're the very hardest kind to get at  --  hard-boiled worldlings . I know  --  I was one . The first time anybody talked to me about God I was so embarrassed I did n't know where  --  And the first time they asked me to confess  --  right before everybody  --  I thought it was too impertinent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confess your sins before everybody ? p. 23 SUSAN TREXEL I did . CHARLOTTE MARLEY What did you tell ' em ? SUSAN TREXEL Well , I thought I absolutely could n't . But something guided me  --  and with everybody looking straight at me  --  I confessed I 'd had my hair touched in Paris . ( They shout with laughter . ) And after that  --  you do n't know the joy and peace  --  when I saw people staring at my hair in the sun  --  I did n't give a damn . ( She rises . ) Irene  --  are you sure it 's easy to have me ? IRENE BURROUGHS I would n't ever call you easy  --  Susan  --  but always delightful . ( Going to SUSAN . ) SUSAN TREXEL What a perfectly sweet thing to say ! Because if it is n't  --  I can go on to school to Blossom . I did turn round and start back  --  and then I thought  --  no  --  I ought to get to all of you as quickly as possible . You 're poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door at center . ) Civilization 's a failure . HUTCHINS STUBBS I heartily agree with you . SUSAN TREXEL It 's a poor sick  --  sick  --  unhappy world . p. 24 IRENE BURROUGHS ( taking SUSAN 'S arm and trying to take her out ) Yes  --  we know . SUSAN TREXEL ( turning back to the others ) What 's the use of all this marvelous mechanical invention if it does n't make the human race happy ? IRENE BURROUGHS ( still trying to lead SUSAN out into the hall ) Yes  --  yes  --  we know . SUSAN TREXEL ( turning back to the others again ) Everybody batting round trying to find something to fill up this awful emptiness . It 's the only thing in the world that will stop war . Oh , Irene  --  I 've brought you the most ravishing panties  --  ( She goes out through the hall with IRENE as the others laugh . ) CLYDE ROCHESTER ( looking at the others in amazement ) Is she kidding herself ? LEONORA STUBBS Or us ? MICHAEL O'HARA Neither . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARLEY Out of the last thing she ran into . Good heavens ! ( Seeing something through the windows at right. ) p. 25 MICHAEL O'HARA What 's the matter ? CHARLOTTE MARLEY It 's Barrie getting out of a car . ( LEONORA goes out quickly through the hall . ) Irene says you have to tell him Susan is n't here . HUTCHINS STUBBS Wait , Charlotte  --  you 're the one to do that . CHARLOTTE MARLEY Not on your life . You do it . ( She hurries out after LEONORA . ) MICHAEL O'HARA I ca n't lie to him . He would n't believe me . HUTCHINS STUBBS ( trying to stop MIKE ) Hold on , Mike  --  MICHAEL O'HARA You 're the one to tell him , Stubbie . ( MIKE rushes out . CLYDE starts to follow him . ) HUTCHINS STUBBS ( stopping CLYDE ) If you want to do something gracious for your hostess  --  stay here and do this . CLYDE ROCHESTER ( trying to get away from STUBBIE ) But I  --  HUTCHINS STUBBS He does n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't matter what you say . ( STUBBIE hurries out. ) p. 26 CLYDE ROCHESTER I say this is a dirty trick . ( After a pause BARRIE TREXEL comes in from the terrace  --  followed by BLOSSOM who comes in reluctantly . BARRIE TREXEL is about forty  --  not striking in any way  --  but an extremely arresting and lovable personality . BLOSSOM is fifteen  --  and at her most unpromising stage  --  tall and awkward . Her teeth are in the process of being straightened . Her vision is being corrected  --  she is wearing horn-rimmed spectacles . Her hair is straggly  --  her clothes unbecoming and unattractive . She is one of those well-born products who look unbelievably hopeless in their adolescence . ) BARRIE TREXEL ( smiling at CLYDE ) I beg your pardon . Is Irene  --  Is Mrs. Burroughs about ? CLYDE ROCHESTER ( hesitating as he smiles at BARRIE ) Not at the moment  --  she went up to change  --  they all did in fact .  --  I was going too  --  but you caught me . BARRIE TREXEL I see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLYDE ROCHESTER I 'm sorry  --  I 'm a stranger here myself . BARRIE TREXEL Oh  --  one of those . I 'm Trexel . Barrie Trexel . My wife is expected . p. 27 CLYDE ROCHESTER Yes ? BARRIE TREXEL This is  --  my  --  daughter  --  Blossom . CLYDE ROCHESTER How do you do ? BLOSSOM TREXEL ( shyly ) How do you do . CLYDE ROCHESTER ( to BARRIE ) My name is Clyde Rochester . BARRIE TREXEL I knew I 'd seen you before . You 've given me many a good laugh . CLYDE ROCHESTER ( putting out his hand to BARRIE ) Thanks for those kind words . Can I give you a little something now ? ( Turning towards the table where the drinks are . ) BARRIE TREXEL ( after an eloquent hesitation ) No  --  thank you . Thank you very much . CLYDE ROCHESTER You 'd rather have information than a drink . BARRIE TREXEL Well  --  it 's about fifty-fifty . CLYDE ROCHESTER I 'll see if I can dig up somebody who does know something . ( He goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trexel is n't here I suppose you want to see Mrs. Burroughs herself . p. 28 BARRIE TREXEL If you please . ( CLYDE goes out through the hall . BARRIE looks at BLOSSOM rather helplessly . ) BLOSSOM TREXEL ( anxiously and timidly ) Of course Mother 's here . Is n't she ? BARRIE TREXEL I should say it 's highly probable . BLOSSOM TREXEL Are n't you sure ? BARRIE TREXEL It 's foolish to be quite  --  sure  --  of other people  --  my dear . Do n't you think ? BLOSSOM TREXEL If she is n't here  --  where is she ? BARRIE TREXEL ( throwing his hat on the couch ) If she is n't  --  she 's thought of a better place . BLOSSOM TREXEL Maybe she did go on to school for me after all . Maybe I ought n't to have come away . BARRIE TREXEL I thought that was what you wanted to do . I thought that was what this was all about . BLOSSOM TREXEL It was . But now that I 've come away  --  I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your pardon ? ( Sitting on the couch . ) BLOSSOM TREXEL All the other girls were leaving  --  and I did n't want them to think I had n't any place to go . I s'pose that sounds silly to you . BARRIE TREXEL Not at all . I see your point . We all like to have some place to go . At least we like people to think we have . That 's almost more important than going . Is n't it ? BLOSSOM TREXEL Yes , it is . When you did n't come to the last day exercises yesterday  --  I said you were sick  --  or they 'd have thought I did n't have anybody to come . BARRIE TREXEL ( very uncomfortable ) Oh . I did n't suppose it really mattered  --  whether I was there or not .  --  I 'm sorry  --  I meant to get there  --  but  --  I got caught in a  --  jam . ( He rises . ) BLOSSOM TREXEL What 's the matter ? BARRIE TREXEL If by any chance your mother has n't got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'll go back to town . BLOSSOM TREXEL You want to go back to town because you 're stuck with me. p. 30 BARRIE TREXEL Not at all . I 'm  --  It 's very nice to be with you . If you do n't mind  --  I do n't . ( They are both shy and ill at ease with each other  --  almost strangers . ) BLOSSOM TREXEL We 've been together four hours . You 're bored to death . BARRIE TREXEL Nonsense ! Four hours is n't very long . BLOSSOM TREXEL It 's the longest I 've ever been with you .  --  Why does n't somebody come ?  --  Ca n't we ring a bell  --  or something ? BARRIE TREXEL We 're not exactly in a bell ringing position . But I was thinking  --  suppose your mother is n't here ? BLOSSOM TREXEL ( startled ) Well  --  what ? BARRIE TREXEL I 'll tell you what we 'll do . You come to town with me for tonight . We 'll have dinner at some nice place and see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We might even buy a hat  --  or something . ( BLOSSOM shakes her head  --  fighting back her tears  --  then touches the brace on her teeth . ) Toothache ? BLOSSOM TREXEL No . It 's just the darned brace . It slips once in a while . p. 31 BARRIE TREXEL Is that a feature of the school ? Do they all wear one of those ? BLOSSOM TREXEL Dad  --  you fool !  --  Oh  --  I should have stayed there . BARRIE TREXEL Why ?  --  After all  --  why should you ? BLOSSOM TREXEL Because there is n't any other place for me to stay . BARRIE TREXEL ( touched and embarrassed ) See here ! I 've got a real idea this time . If you do n't want to go to New York with me  --  how would you like this ? Suppose you and I go over to our place for tonight . The gardener and his wife are there . They might invite us in . They seem like kind people . BLOSSOM TREXEL ( with sudden passionate eagerness ) Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TREXEL Why not ? BLOSSOM TREXEL That would be wonderful ! I 'd rather be there than any place in the world . Would n't you , Dad ? BARRIE TREXEL ( meaning a great deal more than he says ) Just about . BLOSSOM TREXEL If we could all be there together till it 's time to go to camp  --  I would n't mind the camp so much . p. 32 BARRIE TREXEL I thought you liked the camp better than anything . BLOSSOM TREXEL What made you think that ? BARRIE TREXEL Well  --  I 've been told it 's a nice  --  healthy place . BLOSSOM TREXEL ( with sudden force ) If I get any more healthy I 'll die ! I hate the camp . I hate it !  --  Would you mind asking mother to let me do that , dad ? It would only be for a little while . Would you ? BARRIE TREXEL ( uncomfortable and unprepared ) She 'd be more likely to do it if you asked her . BLOSSOM TREXEL No , she would n't . She 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would n't be worth opening the house . BARRIE TREXEL I 'm sorry  --  but you 've got the wrong idea . I 'm not much good at telling her what I want . BLOSSOM TREXEL Why ca n't we all be together once in a while ?  --  Why ca n't we be some sort of a family  --  like other people  --  Why ca n't we ?  --  ( She is n't able to hide her emotion this time and shy sobs come . ) Why  --  ca n't  --  we ? p. 33 BARRIE TREXEL ( amazed and deeply moved ) I did n't know you felt this way about it . I expect it 's all my fault . BLOSSOM TREXEL ( going to him ) You 're all right , Dad . Why ca n't you be this way all the time ? BARRIE TREXEL Seems simple enough  --  does n't it ? But somehow what we mean to be and what we are  --  are quite different . BLOSSOM TREXEL Maybe if we  --  LEEDS ( coming into the entrance at center ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is extremely sorry not to see you  --  but she 's in the bath . BARRIE TREXEL Oh  --  I 'm sorry not to see her . And Mrs. Trexel ?  --  Is she also  --  in the bath ? LEEDS Madame says Mrs. Trexel is expected tomorrow . BARRIE TREXEL I see . BLOSSOM TREXEL Then she did go to school . BARRIE TREXEL ( going to couch to get his hat ) I do n't think so . p. 34 BLOSSOM TREXEL Maybe she 's had an accident or something . BARRIE TREXEL If she has  --  it 's a nice accident . ( Looking at LEEDS . ) Give my regards to Mrs. Burroughs and say I 'll try again tomorrow . ( LEEDS bows and goes . BARRIE goes to BLOSSOM . ) Let 's go ! BLOSSOM TREXEL But , Dad  --  are n't you sort of worried ? BARRIE TREXEL Not a bit . Cheer up . If Susan is lying in the ditch you may be sure she picked it out  --  and it 's a perfectly good ditch . ( He takes BLOSSOM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out as )  --  The Curtain Falls p. 35 Act 1 , Scene 2 ACT ONE Scene II The same room  --  after dinner . There are long sprays of flowers in vases  --  candles are lighted . The chairs in slightly different places . A table is down right holding a picture puzzle . CLYDE is at the piano playing popular music and playing well . LEEDS coming in from center with a tray of after dinner coffee cups  --  takes the tray to CLYDE . CLYDE ROCHESTER Thanks . Put one there  --  will you ? ( LEEDS puts a cup on the piano as IRENE comes down the steps  --  wearing a dinner gown . LEEDS carries the tray to IRENE . ) IRENE BURROUGHS ( as she takes her coffee ) Did Mr. Trexel say where he and his daughter would be tonight , Leeds ? LEEDS He did n't mention it to me , Madame . IRENE BURROUGHS Very well . ( LEEDS goes out . ) CLYDE ROCHESTER ( still playing ) He did n't mention it to me , Madame  --  either . IRENE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him . Are you sure he was perfectly sober ? p. 36 CLYDE ROCHESTER Absolutely  --  and terribly nice . I liked him . IRENE BURROUGHS Of course you did . ( During this LEONORA and MIKE have come in from the hall entrance . They are both in dinner clothes and have their coffee . ) MICHAEL O'HARA ( strolling down to the couch ) There 'll be a large-sized row when he finds out what you did to him . IRENE BURROUGHS ( standing near the piano ) But he wo n't find out  --  if you all keep still . CHARLOTTE MARLEY ( coming in as IRENE says this ) I feel guilty as hell . ( CHARLOTTE is wearing a simple dinner gown . She has no coffee and goes to the table down right and begins working at the picture puzzle . ) IRENE BURROUGHS My conscience is clear . We 're having a peaceful evening . CHARLOTTE MARLEY Stubbie does n't think it 's so peaceful . He 's wriggling like an eel . Susan has just told him if he is n't " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( IRENE goes to the table to watch CHARLOTTE  --  taking up a piece of the puzzle. ) p. 37 LEONORA STUBBS Somebody take this away from me . It 's much too good . Makes my hair curl . ( She pretends to hold on to her cup as MIKE takes it away from her . MIKE stays with LEONORA  --  admiring her too much for IRENE 'S comfort . ) CLYDE ROCHESTER ( still playing ) I wish it would do that to mine . I missed a good part in a picture the other day  --  because I did n't have curly hair . IRENE BURROUGHS ( pointing to a place in the puzzle but watching MIKE ) Try it there . Come and finish this , Mike . You 're such a shark at it . CHARLOTTE MARLEY ( fitting the piece in ) Of course . It 's the old guy 's bald head . I thought it was the baby 's bald bottom . IRENE BURROUGHS ( going out onto the terrace ) I 'm sure I did the right thing . Besides  --  Susan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coming out , Mike ? MICHAEL O'HARA ( as he follows IRENE ) Susan has n't tackled me yet . CHARLOTTE MARLEY Watch your step , you two . ( She smiles at CLYDE and LEONORA as she gets up from the table . ) She 's got her eye on you . I think she suspects the worst . p. 38 CLYDE ROCHESTER ( getting up from the piano ) How about you ? Can you throw that stone ? CHARLOTTE MARLEY I 'm going to keep on throwing it  --  till Susan finds me out . ( CHARLOTTE goes onto the terrace . ) LEONORA STUBBS ( sitting at the table to work at the puzzle ) I wish she 'd tell me what 's right and what 's wrong . I honestly do n't know  --  Clyde . I honestly do n't . CLYDE ROCHESTER ( standing at the table to watch LEONORA ) Who does ? LEONORA STUBBS Oh , I 'm so bored ! So bored  --  so bored ! CLYDE ROCHESTER Who is n't ? LEONORA STUBBS I know I 'm not fair to Stubbie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me  --  and I have n't got the guts to chuck it and go back to my own job . CLYDE ROCHESTER ( sitting at the table and taking up a piece of the puzzle ) I 'd hate to see you go back to the old tough fight . And it  --  Here , try this  --  ( Giving LEONORA a piece of the puzzle . ) And it is tough . There 's no use kidding ourselves . p. 39 LEONORA STUBBS Of course it is . When we do have a job in the theatre we 're scared green we 'll never get another one as long as we live . Stubbie would never think I wanted to go back to that . He 'd think it was a man  --  you  --  or somebody else . ( LEONORA gets up from the table and moves towards the couch . ) CLYDE ROCHESTER Since it is n't me  --  I hope you stick this out . LEONORA STUBBS Oh , do n't be noble . CLYDE ROCHESTER ( getting up ) At least I 'm not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing you married to somebody else . I did n't know it would be quite so  --  ( He stops and turns away as SUSAN comes in from the hall  --  radiant in a very chic dinner gown . ) SUSAN TREXEL ( after a pause ) These awful moments when we know we 've come at the wrong time  --  but it would be still worse to go out again  --  would n't it ? LEONORA STUBBS ( laughing as she sits on the couch ) What makes you say that ? CLYDE ROCHESTER You do n't ever come at the wrong time  --  for anybody  --  do you ? p. 40 SUSAN TREXEL How enchanting you are ! ( She looks from one to the other . ) I do n't wonder it has happened . LEONORA STUBBS What 's happened ? SUSAN TREXEL I do n't know whether you can quite stand my honesty or not . LEONORA STUBBS Try us and see . SUSAN TREXEL Everybody at Lady Wiggam 's was so beautifully honest we did n't mind having our worst faults told to us . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to be awfully good at seeing inside of people . ( She goes close to CLYDE . ) CLYDE ROCHESTER ( drawing his coat across his chest ) You terrify me . SUSAN TREXEL I 'm seeing what makes you unhappy . LEONORA STUBBS Clyde 's the happiest person I know . SUSAN TREXEL But you 're not . I can see you are absolutely starving for the truth , Leonora . LEONORA STUBBS How am I to know that I know the truth  --  when I see it ? SUSAN TREXEL ( putting a hand on CLYDE 'S arm ) It 's right here in front of you , my dear . p. 41 LEONORA STUBBS If you 're looking for sin I 'm sorry to disappoint you  --  Clyde is n't my lover . SUSAN TREXEL ( to CLYDE ) But you 're in love with her  --  are n't you ? CLYDE ROCHESTER Do you call that a sin ? SUSAN TREXEL It need n't be . You could exalt your love and make it marvelous . But first you 'd have to confess it  --  openly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody 's always known it ? SUSAN TREXEL That 's beautiful ! If you 'd only say that to Stubbie  --  he would n't be afraid of you . CLYDE ROCHESTER Afraid ? You flatter me . SUSAN TREXEL If you 'd say to him , " Of course I 'm in love with your wife  --  but I 'm not hurting her  --  and I 'm taking nothing away from you  --  it only puts something fine in me . " If you 'd say that to  --  ( STUBBIE comes into the entrance at center as SUSAN says this . There is an uncomfortable pause . ) HUTCHINS STUBBS Why the great silence ? p. 42 SUSAN TREXEL Clyde has just said something brave and beautiful . LEONORA STUBBS ( getting up quickly ) I ca n't live up to anything so lofty . Let 's go out in the air , Stubbie . ( LEONORA goes towards the terrace . ) HUTCHINS STUBBS ( staring at CLYDE  --  suspiciously ) I 'd like to hear the brave and beautiful thing . SUSAN TREXEL Do n't let this moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terribly embarrassed , but trying to take it lightly ) She 's kidding me . SUSAN TREXEL Now do n't fall down  --  Clyde . CLYDE ROCHESTER ( trying to laugh ) I 'm already down . You put things into me that are n't there at all . I 'm anything but a fine and brave young man . I 'm very commonplace and at the moment very hot . I need air . ( He goes out onto the terrace . ) SUSAN TREXEL You see when we run away from things they become dangerous . HUTCHINS STUBBS What are you trying to get at , Susan ? p. 43 SUSAN TREXEL I 'm trying to make  --  LEONORA STUBBS ( quickly ) She 's trying to make fools of us . Where is your sense of humor , darling ? Are you coming out with me or not ? HUTCHINS STUBBS ( suspiciously ) Are you afraid to have me stay and hear this  --  marvelous truth  --  that Susan is going in for ? LEONORA STUBBS I certainly am not afraid of the truth  --  but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . ( LEONORA goes onto the terrace  --  trying to hide her anger . ) HUTCHINS STUBBS What 's going on here ? SUSAN TREXEL ( acting a little and enjoying herself tremendously ) He said so honestly just now  --  " Of course I 'm in love with Leonora . All the world has always known it . " HUTCHINS STUBBS ( exploding ) What ? SUSAN TREXEL Be big , Stubbie . Take him by the hand and tell him you trust him . HUTCHINS STUBBS I 'll take him by the seat of the pants and throw him out of the house . I 'll thank you to mind your own business , Susan . ( IRENE comes back from the terrace. ) p. 44 SUSAN TREXEL ( going close to STUBBIE ) Dear heart  --  look at me . Let me say this to you . ( STUBBIE glares at SUSAN resentfully  --  feeling very foolish . ) You 've got depths and fine spiritual forces in your nature which you do n't know anything about . HUTCHINS STUBBS Neither do you . You let my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center entrance . IRENE laughs . ) SUSAN TREXEL Everybody behaves that way  --  at first . It takes time . Stubbie 's soul is hardened . ( SUSAN sits on the hassock at center . ) IRENE BURROUGHS I ask you one thing , Susan , for heaven 's sake  --  let our souls alone over the week-end . ( IRENE goes to the piano and plays carelessly  --  listening to the others . ) LEONORA STUBBS ( hearing what IRENE said as she comes in from the terrace and going to sit on the couch ) Oh , no  --  do n't . It 's so diverting . Susan says she can see way down inside of us . CHARLOTTE MARLEY ( coming in after LEONORA ) Sounds a little obstetrical . You need n't be probing round for my soul  --  Susan , I do n't think I 've got one . So do n't bother about me . ( CHARLOTTE sits at the picture puzzle table. ) p. 45 SUSAN TREXEL Oh , you 're sweet , Charlotte ! But you 're so good-natured it makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  would you like me to tell you , darling ? CHARLOTTE MARLEY I would not . SUSAN TREXEL But you could change yourself and everybody you come in contact with if you  --  CHARLOTTE MARLEY I do n't want to change anybody  --  not even you , Susan . If you were the least bit different you would n't be so good of your kind . SUSAN TREXEL You 're fighting something in yourself you ought to confess , my dear  --  or you would n't be so touchy . ( She gets up , throwing her long scarf about her shoulders . ) Oh , what a night  --  what a night ! The stars are pulling me up  --  up to them . ( She floats out onto the terrace dramatically  --  making the scarf flutter after her . ) LEONORA STUBBS Does she believe what she 's saying ? IRENE BURROUGHS Believe it ? She does n't even know what she 's saying . CHARLOTTE MARLEY It 's Lady Wiggam who impressed her  --  not God . p. 46 IRENE BURROUGHS You 're both so silly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you be angry ? It 's funny ! But the joke is she does hit the nail on the head . LEONORA STUBBS You have to think it 's funny or be more furious than you ever were in your life . CHARLOTTE MARLEY What makes me so damned mad is Barrie and Blossom chasing round trying to find her  --  while she 's reforming us . If she 'd  --  ( CHARLOTTE stops suddenly as BARRIE comes into the hall doorway . He has obviously been drinking  --  and carries a huge bunch of peonies in his arms . He is perfectly steady on his feet by moving carefully  --  and perfectly articulate by speaking cautiously . There is about him a tremendous sweetness which is at the moment tragic and pathetic . ) BARRIE TREXEL Hello  --  Irene . IRENE BURROUGHS ( startled ) Hello , Barrie . ( The three women are quickly alert with nerves and anxiety  --  watching the window . ) BARRIE TREXEL I s'pose I ought to have brought these to you  --  but I did n't . I brought ' em to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our place . Where is Susan ? p. 47 IRENE BURROUGHS Why , she  --  I  --  she  --  She is n't out here . BARRIE TREXEL Hello  --  Charlotte  --  how are you ? CHARLOTTE MARLEY Hello , Barrie . BARRIE TREXEL ( looking at LEONORA who rises ) And who 's this lovely thing ? IRENE BURROUGHS It 's Stubbie 's wife , Barrie . Leonora , this is Barrie Trexel . ( LEONORA bows . ) BARRIE TREXEL I heard Stubbie married an awfully pretty woman . LEONORA STUBBS Are n't you nice ! BARRIE TREXEL Not very . ( IRENE pantomimes to LEONORA to go outside and keep SUSAN out there . ) I 'm sorry I did n't get to the wedding . Something un  --  very un  --  kept me away .  --  I ca n't think now what it was  --  but if I 'd known you then  - -  I 'm sure I would have made it . ( Smiling at LEONORA with courtly grace . ) IRENE BURROUGHS ( going to BARRIE ) Let 's look for Susan  --  she 's inside some place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) If you do n't mind , Irene  --  I 'll stay right here . You bring her in here , will you ? I do n't want to see her with a lot of people . I 've got something very important to say to her . IRENE BURROUGHS Then you look for her outside , Leonora  --  and I 'll look inside . BARRIE TREXEL But do n't tell her I 'm here . Just send her in . I want to surprise her . Understand ? ( LEONORA nods and goes out closing the window . IRENE goes out center  --  closing the hall door after her . ) I 'm always glad to see you , Charl  --  you 're a good old scout . Got more heart than all the rest of ' em put together . Do n't you think these are beautiful  --  s-s-specimens ? CHARLOTTE MARLEY ( going to him and trying to take the flowers ) They 're magnificent . Do n't you want to put them down ? BARRIE TREXEL No  --  I do not ! I do not wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em up . Susan likes ' em . CHARLOTTE MARLEY She 'll love these . BARRIE TREXEL Listen , Charl  --  I 've got to see Susan about something very important . In fact it 's about the most important thing I ever did have to see her about . p. 49 CHARLOTTE MARLEY Oh , Barrie  --  if it 's so important  --  then you want to be prepared and clear-headed  --  BARRIE TREXEL I 'm prepared all right . CHARLOTTE MARLEY Do n't try to see her tonight . Wait till morning when you 're fresh  --  and right on your toes . BARRIE TREXEL I 'm on my toes all right . ( Trying to rise on his toes . ) CHARLOTTE MARLEY ( catching him by the arm firmly ) Do n't be a fool , Barrie ! You know I know you 're tight . BARRIE TREXEL I thought you were my friend , Charl . CHARLOTTE MARLEY I am ! That 's why I 'm telling you . Come and get in your car and go away and come back in the morning . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even tell her you  --  ( She tries to take him toward the windows . ) BARRIE TREXEL ( stubbornly  --  pulling away from her ) It 's got to be done now  --  if I do n't  --  CHARLOTTE MARLEY You 'll ball it all up . p. 50 BARRIE TREXEL ( losing his control  --  his voice rising with emotion and desperation ) I 'm going to face Susan tonight and tell her something she 's got to do  --  or by God  --  ( IRENE opens the hall doors and comes in quickly with STUBBIE . STUBBIE goes to BARRIE and IRENE closes the doors . ) HUTCHINS STUBBS Hello , Barrie  --  glad to see you . ( Putting out his hand kindly . ) BARRIE TREXEL Hello , Stubbie.  --  I do n't seem to be glad to see you . ( Not taking STUBBIE 's hand . ) Where 's Susan ? IRENE BURROUGHS She 's not in the house . She must be outside . HUTCHINS STUBBS ( trying to take BARRIE 's arm ) Come along with me and we 'll find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look out for my arm , Stubbie . I sometimes lose control of it . ( To IRENE . ) What is this ?  --  Do n't you want me to see Susan ? IRENE BURROUGHS Do n't be silly . We 're trying to find her for you . p. 51 BARRIE TREXEL I do n't see why it 's so damned hard to find her . I 'll go out this way and get her myself . ( He starts toward the windows . ) And I do n't want anybody to come with me . ( LEONORA comes in quickly  --  closing the window behind her . ) LEONORA STUBBS ( speaking quickly ) Clyde says Susan left him and came in the house .  --  In the library  --  he thinks . BARRIE TREXEL ( suspiciously ) That 's a very peculiar place for Susan to be . Look here , Irene  --  have you told her I 'm here and she 's hiding from me ? IRENE BURROUGHS What an idea ! HUTCHINS STUBBS Why should she do that ? BARRIE TREXEL ( his anger and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't like you . I just c-c-constitutionally do n't like you . You should n't have told her I was here , Irene . This is my business . IRENE BURROUGHS You must believe me , Barrie . Susan does not know you 're here . BARRIE TREXEL Then where in hell is she ? I 'm going to see her . You hear me ? ( He pushes IRENE aside and starts to the hall door. ) p. 52 HUTCHINS STUBBS Naturally you are . Come on . Let 's look in the library . BARRIE TREXEL That 's enough , Stubbie . Go away . I 'll go alone . I know a book when I see one just as well as you do . ( MIKE opens the hall doors and comes in . ) MICHAEL O'HARA Hello  --  Barrie  --  Hello . BARRIE TREXEL How are you , Mike ? ( Shaking hands with MIKE . ) I do n't know anybody I 'd rather see  --  if I 've got to see anybody . MICHAEL O'HARA The same here . How are you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married now  --  are n't you ? Or are you ? Well , I wish you luck anyway . God knows I wish you luck . Have you been reading a book , too ? MICHAEL O'HARA Do I look it ? BARRIE TREXEL Not to me . ( He takes MIKE 's arm and draws him away from the others . ) Listen , Mike . They 're trying to put something over on me.  --  Do n't let ' em do it . This is something big  --  one of those once-in-a-lifetime things . Look at me . You know I 'm cold sober . p. 53 MICHAEL O'HARA You 're too sober . That 's what 's the matter with you . What you need is a good stiff drink to put it over . ( He takes BARRIE 's arm and they start towards the hall . ) BARRIE TREXEL You 're a man , Mike .  --  I knew you 'd understand . ( As they reach the door  --  BARRIE turns . ) Excuse me , Irene  --  if I seem a little rude . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my hands .  --  I owe you an apology , Stubbie  --  but I do n't apologize . ( He goes out . MIKE follows him . ) HUTCHINS STUBBS Mike will give him a drink . About one more and he 'll forget all about Susan . IRENE BURROUGHS Then you and Mike put him to bed . Do n't send him away . He must n't drive a car now . HUTCHINS STUBBS I 'd like to put him in Susan 's bed  --  as a little surprise for her . ( STUBBIE goes out  --  closing the doors after him . ) CHARLOTTE MARLEY It 's disgusting and revolting  --  and I 'm terribly sorry for Susan  --  but I 'm still more sorry for Barrie . LEONORA STUBBS I gave Clyde the high sign to keep Susan out there . May she come in now ? p. 54 IRENE BURROUGHS ( sitting on the couch ) Oh , yes  --  Susan may come in  --  now that we 've made everything all right for her . ( LEONORA goes out  --  leaving the window open . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know why we did n't let her face the music . IRENE BURROUGHS Somebody has always removed the disagreeable things for Susan  --  all her  --  SUSAN TREXEL ( coming in from outside  --  radiant and excited ) It 's thrilling !  --  I 've made Clyde see how he can exalt his love and make it marvelous ! IRENE BURROUGHS What ? SUSAN TREXEL And I know I can make Stubbie rise to this . CHARLOTTE MARLEY You 've got an awful nerve , Susan  --  butting into that . SUSAN TREXEL Nerve ?  --  It 's divine guidance , darling . That 's what it takes to help people  --  especially your friends . CHARLOTTE MARLEY It sometimes takes divine guidance to keep your mouth shut , too . ( CHARLOTTE goes out through the hall. ) p. 55 SUSAN TREXEL I have n't found a way to get at Charlotte  --  yet . IRENE BURROUGHS ( sitting on the stool at center ) Now , Susan  --  we all know you 've had a grand time  --  and we 've listened because it 's you . But for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . SUSAN TREXEL I knew it would be harder to talk to you , Irene  --  than anybody in the world  --  because we 're so close . But that 's foolish . Why should n't you and I talk about God and goodness  --  as well as clothes or food  --  or anything else ? IRENE BURROUGHS ( her irritation rising ) In the first place , I do n't think you can tell me anything about God . SUSAN TREXEL Oh , Irene , dear  --  you 're so big and broad about everything else . Why should you shut your mind to this ? Why do n't you open your heart to me , dear ? IRENE BURROUGHS What in the name of heaven are you talking about ? SUSAN TREXEL I 've got to say it , Irene  --  or I shall be falling down . I have an awfully strong feeling that you and Mike have put your love on the wrong plane . p. 56 IRENE BURROUGHS You 're insane ! SUSAN TREXEL I 'm afraid it is n't a spiritual thing . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you marry him  --  IRENE BURROUGHS ( rising ) I wo n't stay and listen to such slush ! ( She starts up to the hall door . ) SUSAN TREXEL You 're running away from the truth because it hurts .  --  Darling  --  Darling  --  confess  --  to us  --  right here .  --  We love you  --  we 'll forgive you  --  if you 'll only confess and give him up . IRENE BURROUGHS What about you ?  --  Why do n't you do a little confessing ? Not that bluff about your hair . Everybody knows that anyway . SUSAN TREXEL Not unless you told them . Everybody thinks my hair is marvelous . IRENE BURROUGHS Your own life is a mess . Clean it up before you begin preaching to other people . SUSAN TREXEL My own life is a great sorrow . IRENE BURROUGHS Sorrow  --  poppy-cock ! If you were decent to Barrie you would n't have so much sorrow on your hands . p. 57 SUSAN TREXEL What a frightfully nasty thing to say to me , Irene . IRENE BURROUGHS Barrie was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perfectly sober  --  and he said he was coming back  --  to-morrow . I wish I 'd let him see you . After all he is a sweet thing . SUSAN TREXEL Oh , yes  --  other people 's husbands are always so sweet .  --  I never know where he is  --  or what he 's doing  --  or what he 'll be like when he does turn up .  --  It 's ghastly !  --  It makes me so nervous I could scream . ( Closing her eyes suddenly . ) Now  --  peace , Susan  --  peace  --  Ask for divine help and it will come . ( She opens her eyes . ) It does , Irene  --  it does .  --  If you and Mike would . . . MICHAEL O'HARA ( opening the hall door and coming in ) If you and Mike would what ? IRENE BURROUGHS Stop , Susan . SUSAN TREXEL I have n't condemned her at all , Mike . Nor you either . Not one little bit . I know something is gnawing inside your soul that you ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Susan ! Nobody knows what you 're talking about . Shut up ! SUSAN TREXEL ( after a dramatic pause ) I wo n't let you hurt me , Irene . I 'll go and be alone a little while  --  and I shall pray for you , darling  --  just as hard as I possibly can . ( SUSAN sweeps out through the hall . ) IRENE BURROUGHS ( her nerves snapping ) She 's gone absolutely nutty ! The nerve !  --  She 'll forgive me ! The nerve ! MICHAEL O'HARA I thought you were n't going to tell her . IRENE BURROUGHS I didn't.  --  I did n't . MICHAEL O'HARA How did she know ? IRENE BURROUGHS She did n't . She just took a shot  --  and I was so furious I gave myself away I s'pose . MICHAEL O'HARA Well  --  what of it ! ( He goes to IRENE  --  puts his arms about her and kisses her lips warmly . ) Do n't mind Susan . How can you let anything she says make you angry ?  --  It 's funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny . ( Moving away . ) CHARLOTTE MARLEY ( coming in from the hall ) Did you get him to bed ? MICHAEL O'HARA I left him with Stubbie and Leeds . CLYDE ROCHESTER ( as he and LEONORA come in from the outside ) All quiet on the Western front ? CHARLOTTE MARLEY Oh , yes  --  everything 's serene now  --  for Susan . LEONORA STUBBS Where is she ? IRENE BURROUGHS She 's praying  --  for me . ( STUBBIE comes in from the hall . ) CHARLOTTE MARLEY Is he asleep ? HUTCHINS STUBBS He will be . For some unaccountable reason Barrie does n't like me when he 's tight . Too bad we did n't let him see Susan and get off whatever it is he 's got on his mind . He 'll never be as good when he 's sober . IRENE BURROUGHS I 'm never going to try to protect Susan again as long as I live . HUTCHINS STUBBS Somebody ought to do something to bring her to her senses  --  right now . p. 60 MICHAEL O'HARA I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How ? MICHAEL O'HARA Throw a confession scene . IRENE BURROUGHS What ? MICHAEL O'HARA I 'll tell her I 'm terribly impressed with what she 's been saying  --  and I 'll confess I  --  killed a man  --  or stole a million  --  or some little thing like that . CHARLOTTE MARLEY Oh  --  I think that would be sort of mean . LEONORA STUBBS Oh , no  --  it would be fun . Let 's do it . IRENE BURROUGHS She 's got it coming to her . HUTCHINS STUBBS Certainly she has . I think that 's an excellent idea , Mike . CLYDE ROCHESTER How are you going to do it ? IRENE BURROUGHS We all have to act . LEONORA STUBBS Well , I ca n't act unless I rehearse . What do we do ? HUTCHINS STUBBS Shall I write a few lines ? MICHAEL O'HARA No  --  no  --  just make it up as you go .  --  When I begin  --  try to stop me  --  so I 'll have something to act up to . p. 61 CHARLOTTE MARLEY What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing CHARLOTTE how to do it ) You say  --  " No , no , Mike !  --  Do n't do it !  --  I ca n't bear it ! " ( CHARLOTTE rises  --  rehearsing her lines under her breath as she goes to sit at table at right . ) MICHAEL O'HARA Now  --  all of you  --  all of you  --  try to stop me . When I  --  SUSAN TREXEL ( coming in  --  with exalted excitement ) Now  --  if you want a proof  --  a manifestation of everything I 've been saying  --  here it is . Irene and I had a fight . We both said cruel hard things to each other . IRENE BURROUGHS Which we meant . SUSAN TREXEL And now they 're wiped out . I forgive you , Irene  --  and I know you forgive me . ( She kisses IRENE . ) You do  --  do n't you , darling ? It 's absolutely as though it had never been . You see ?  --  You do n't know the peace and sweetness I feel now . And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to act ) But it 's not easy , Susan . p. 62 SUSAN TREXEL ( looking up at him  --  surprised ) What , Stubbie ? HUTCHINS STUBBS I say what you 're asking us to do is not easy . SUSAN TREXEL But try , dear  --  try ! MICHAEL O'HARA Susan  --  I 'm awfully impressed with what you 've been saying . SUSAN TREXEL Oh  --  are you , Mike ? ( Amazed and impressed . ) MICHAEL O'HARA Something has been gnawing at my soul for a long time . SUSAN TREXEL ( beginning to be very flattered ) Darling  --  how wonderful ! MICHAEL O'HARA ( growing convincingly emotional ) I want to confess  --  but I do n't see how I  --  CLYDE ROCHESTER ( grasping MIKE 'S arm ) Do n't lose your head , Mike ! You may regret what you 're saying all your life ! SUSAN TREXEL Do n't  --  do n't , Clyde .  --  Go on , Mike . HUTCHINS STUBBS ( acting ) Be very cautious , Mike . p. 63 LEONORA STUBBS ( acting ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's gone ? MICHAEL O'HARA Because it  --  I  --  if I had the courage  --  ( LEONORA pokes IRENE to make her do her bit . ) IRENE BURROUGHS ( acting ) Do n't be a fool , Mike ! CHARLOTTE MARLEY No  --  no  --  Mike  --  I ca n't bear it ! ( Giving a very wooden imitation of LEONORA . ) MICHAEL O'HARA These people can never forgive me . They wo n't understand , Susan . SUSAN TREXEL ( more and more impressed ) That does n't matter . I will . God will . Go on , dear . MICHAEL O'HARA I  --  I do n't think I can . ( He sinks into a chair  --  his elbows on his knees  --  his head in his hands . ) SUSAN TREXEL ( going close to MIKE ) You must , Mike  --  you must ! Do n't stop . Do n't kill this impulse . Let it come !  --  You 'll be sorry if you do n't . ( They are all watching SUSAN and MIKE so intently  --  their backs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come into the doorway . He is dressed as he was when he went out  --  the flowers still in his arms. ) p. 64 MICHAEL O'HARA I 've done  --  a horrible thing ! SUSAN TREXEL ( very appealing  --  carried away by her own dramatic instinct ) Then ask God to help you . He knows what your temptation was . Telling us is only to break down your will  --  make you humble  --  bring you nearer to Him . No matter what we are  --  or what we do  --  if we 're sorry  --  really  --  really and honestly want His help  --  we can be made over . ( She puts a hand on MIKE 'S head . ) BARRIE TREXEL ( speaking from the doorway very simply and very honestly ) If you believe what you 've just said , Susan  --  I believe it too . SUSAN TREXEL ( turning quickly ) Barrie ! ( MIKE rises and moves away . The others turn in awed embarrassment . ) BARRIE TREXEL ( coming to SUSAN ) Do you mean He can do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do  --  I do ask Him . ( BLOSSOM comes in through the open window. ) p. 65 SUSAN TREXEL ( putting her hands over her face ) Oh , Barrie !  --  How could you ! BARRIE TREXEL ( as he sees BLOSSOM ) Hello , Blossie !  --  I forgot all about you out there in the car . BLOSSOM TREXEL I waited such a long time  --  I thought something must have happened . ( CHARLOTTE puts her arms around BLOSSOM . ) BARRIE TREXEL Something has happened . SUSAN TREXEL Do n't , Barrie  --  do n't  --  do n't  --  please ! BARRIE TREXEL Your mother has just said something that changes the whole stinking rotten world . I never knew you , Susan . You look like a shining angel . You 've got star dust in your hair . I lay these at your feet . ( BARRIE lets the flowers fall slowly at SUSAN 'S feet . She looks at him in unbelieving wonder as The Curtain Falls @x Time : Seven o'clock the following morning . Place : A guest room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is seen  --  showing a door into the hall and one opening into another room . The furnishings are luxuriously comfortable in simple good taste . SUSAN is in bed asleep . Her dressing gown is thrown over a low chair at right  --  her slippers are on the floor beside the bed . After a moment there is a low knock at the hall door . A pause  --  then the door is cautiously opened and BARRIE comes in . He closes the door and goes to the bed and looks down at SUSAN , who is sleeping serenely  --  surrounded by lace and pink silk . BARRIE is dressed in the clothes of yesterday and perfectly sober . His face is tense and troubled . BARRIE TREXEL ( quietly ) Susan . ( Speaking a little louder . ) Susan ! SUSAN TREXEL ( opening her eyes ) What are you doing here , Barrie ? BARRIE TREXEL I want to talk to you . p. 67 SUSAN TREXEL You ca n't . Go away . What time is it ? BARRIE TREXEL Seven o'clock . SUSAN TREXEL ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go away ! BARRIE TREXEL I 've got to talk to you  --  before we get going . SUSAN TREXEL ( feeling a little foolish and guilty because of the situation last night  --  now protests emotionally and emphatically trying to justify herself to herself ) You 've disgraced me . You humiliated me last night beyond  --  And how could you let Blossom see you like that ?  --  And why did you take her away from school ?  --  Why ? BARRIE TREXEL Because she  --  SUSAN TREXEL It is n't what I planned .  --  Give me that , please . ( She indicates her bed-jacket on the foot of the bed . He tosses it to her . ) You 've upset and ruined everything . You do n't even know what you did last night . ( Putting on the jacket , an alluring trivial thing . ) BARRIE TREXEL Oh , yes , I do .  --  And I 'm sorry , Susan . Terribly  --  terribly sorry .  --  That 's about all I can say . p. 68 SUSAN TREXEL And it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window , will you . ( BARRIE draws the curtains at the window and warm sunlight floods the room . ) How can I go on , Barrie ?  --  How can you expect me to ?  --  I ca n't . Last night was the end . I simply can not stand any more . ( She throws herself down on the pillows again . ) BARRIE TREXEL ( coming away from the window ) Susan  --  I 'd made up my mind to say to you as soon as you got back  --  I 'll give you the divorce . I give up . You can have it . SUSAN TREXEL ( turning her head on the pillow to look at him in amazement ) Oh !  --  BARRIE TREXEL This kind of life is n't living at all . Any more for me  --  than it is for you . SUSAN TREXEL ( sitting up in bed ) Then you do see it  --  at last . ( She fumbles under her pillow for a handkerchief  --  BARRIE throws her his from his coat pocket . ) BARRIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 69 SUSAN TREXEL What do you mean  --  meant to ?  --  What are you going to do then ? BARRIE TREXEL Tell me this . Is there anybody else you want to marry ? SUSAN TREXEL No  --  there is not . It is n't a man at all .  --  No matter how many people may want to marry me  --  I 'm always just as  --  There was the most divine Czechoslovakian on the Riviera you ever saw  --  and I was just as  --  I always am . You ca n't blame men because our marriage is a failure . BARRIE TREXEL I can blame myself  --  I s'pose . SUSAN TREXEL We were frightfully young .  --  We thought we saw things in each other that were n't there at all . BARRIE TREXEL Where are the things you thought were me  --  and the things I thought were you .  --  Where have they gone ?  --  God  --  ca n't we get ' em back ? SUSAN TREXEL Things do n't come back . Nobody stands still . We go up  --  or we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'm the down , I s'pose . SUSAN TREXEL I did n't mean that . But I 'm glad you know now that a divorce is right . We 'll be so much happier when we stop pretending to be married  --  and are perfectly natural about it . That coat 's awfully good on you , dear . p. 70 BARRIE TREXEL I 'm not going to give you the divorce . SUSAN TREXEL Now , Barrie  --  do n't wobble back and forth . BARRIE TREXEL There 's one more question I want to ask you . SUSAN TREXEL Oh  --  these questions .  --  Give me my brush , please . BARRIE TREXEL ( taking a hair-brush from the dressing table and giving it to SUSAN ) Did you mean what you were saying last night when I came in ? SUSAN TREXEL Of course I meant it . BARRIE TREXEL Are you honest about it ? SUSAN TREXEL ( brushing her hair ) Honest ?  --  You see  --  you do n't see .  --  I knew it !  --  I knew it ! BARRIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it come from ?  --  What 's happened to you ? SUSAN TREXEL Marvelous things have happened to me . I 'm an absolutely changed woman . But I do n't expect you to believe that . BARRIE TREXEL I believed it last night all right . But in the cold light of morning  --  it 's not so easy . p. 71 SUSAN TREXEL You did n't even know what I was saying . BARRIE TREXEL You said  --  no matter what we are  --  or what we 've done  --  we can be made over  --  if we  --  ask  --  God  --  to help .  --  That 's what made me change my mind about the divorce  --  that 's what made me think you might want me to try again . Listen , Susan  --  this is what I came in to say  --  Do you think there 's any hope for me ? SUSAN TREXEL We ca n't expect miracles , Barrie . BARRIE TREXEL Why not ? I want to pull up , Susan  --  and keep straight . I 'm going to try . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Barrie . If you do mean this  --  you 'd have to prove it . You 'll have to go off by yourself and  --  and prove that you do mean it . BARRIE TREXEL Susan  --  if there is anything in what you 've got hold of  --  why ca n't it help me ? SUSAN TREXEL I ca n't promise that it would , Barrie . BARRIE TREXEL Why not ?  --  You were promising everybody else last night . SUSAN TREXEL Yes  --  but you may not be one of the ones who can be changed . It means complete self-abnegation. p. 72 BARRIE TREXEL One of the reasons I want to do it is Blossom . SUSAN TREXEL What ? BARRIE TREXEL ( sitting in the armchair ) When I saw her in that school yesterday  --  with every other kid in the whole damned place running off to a good time  --  going home  --  I felt like a skunk . There she was  --  nobody wanting her  --  and no place to go . SUSAN TREXEL Are you blaming me for that ? BARRIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't anything like as much of a bore as I thought it would be . She 's got a damned lot of common sense and intelligence . I seemed to be seeing her for the first time somehow . SUSAN TREXEL ( taking a small hand mirror from the table by her bed and looking at herself ) And how do you think she looks ? BARRIE TREXEL Like hell !  --  With that God-awful bit in her mouth . Does she have to have that ? SUSAN TREXEL So it seems . I did n't . My teeth were perfectly all right . BARRIE TREXEL ( rising ) So were mine .  --  You ca n't hang that on me . I thought she and I would stay all night at our place  --  but  --  you know what happened . p. 73 SUSAN TREXEL ( putting the mirror down ) Yes  --  I know  --  and with Blossom . ( Getting out of bed and slipping her feet into her mules . ) That 's why I have to keep her away from you  --  that 's why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp in summer . BARRIE TREXEL ( going towards the bed ) And that 's what we 've got to do something about . She hates the camp . SUSAN TREXEL She loves it . ( They both speak at once  --  their voices rising . ) BARRIE TREXEL She hates it , I tell you . She wants to be at home with you and me . SUSAN TREXEL This is very sudden . Why are you so interested in Blossom out of the blue ?  --  You certainly never have been before . BARRIE TREXEL I 'm telling you . I did n't know how it was . I did n't know she was lonely . I did n't know she was unhappy . I did n't know anything that age could feel that way  --  about anything . SUSAN TREXEL You 've neglected her  --  I have n't ! You 've made her fatherless  --  I have n't ! And now you 're blaming me for not having her with me all the time . You were with her one day and got tight right before her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? p. 74 BARRIE TREXEL I 'll tell you what you can do . ( He starts to sit on the chair over which SUSAN 'S negligee is thrown . ) SUSAN TREXEL Do n't sit on that ! ( BARRIE tosses the negligee onto the bed  --  and sits in the chair . ) BARRIE TREXEL You can open the house  --  and keep her with us this summer . SUSAN TREXEL Both of you  --  under the same roof  --  all summer ?  --  I could n't get through it . You 've no right to ask it . ( She takes off the jacket and gets into the negligee . ) BARRIE TREXEL She has a right to ask it . She has a right to expect something of us . SUSAN TREXEL You ca n't expect me to turn my life upside down just because you 're ashamed of yourself for a few minutes .  --  I 've had to learn to get along without you . I 've had to fill my life with other things .  --  This summer I 'm going to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole life . BARRIE TREXEL ( rising ) What ?  --  What are you going to do ? p. 75 SUSAN TREXEL I 've promised Lady Wiggam to advance this new movement over here . BARRIE TREXEL What movement ? SUSAN TREXEL This new approach to God . BARRIE TREXEL That 's the bunk , Susan . ( They face each other across the bed  --  their voices rising . ) SUSAN TREXEL I knew you would n't know what I 'm talking about . BARRIE TREXEL I know every word you said is hot air unless you can forget yourself long enough to do this . I never asked you to do anything you did n't want to do  --  before . Will you give me a chance  --  to see what I can do ? SUSAN TREXEL And how long would you last , Barrie ?  --  You 'd start off so grandly  --  as if the very birds in the trees were singing a new song  --  and then  --  smash ! ( She sits before her dressing table . ) Do n't you suppose I 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm lonely ?  --  Do n't you suppose I 'm tired trying to put things into my life to make up for the things that are n't there ? BARRIE TREXEL Yes  --  I s'pose you are . p. 76 SUSAN TREXEL ( rushing on  --  half honest  --  half dramatizing herself ) I came back thinking I would n't ask for the divorce . Something high and exalted came to me  --  right on the boat  --  right there by the railing  --  and I felt lifted up  --  I wanted to stay there  --  live there . And when I saw that shore line with all those marvelous things sticking up I said  --  " After all , this is home  --  Barrie 's there  --  and maybe he has bucked up "  --  and then you walked in last night and I knew how utterly hopeless it all is.  --  Nothing else will do , Barrie  --  it 's got to be a divorce . ( She rises and goes to the window . ) BARRIE TREXEL Then you wo n't do what I ask ? SUSAN TREXEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . BARRIE TREXEL ( going to SUSAN ) Susan  --  I 'll make you a proposition . If you 'll open the house for the summer  --  and have Blossom and me in it  --  the first time I slip  --  if I do  --  I 'll give you the divorce .  --  What do you say ? SUSAN TREXEL ( hesitating ) But how can I be sure that you will ? p. 77 BARRIE TREXEL I 'll put it in writing . You 'll have me sewed up . Here 's your chance , Susan . There 's my hand on it . SUSAN TREXEL Do you realize what you 're doing , Barrie ?  --  What you 're promising ? BARRIE TREXEL I 'm promising to give you up forever  --  if I slip . SUSAN TREXEL Even if it 's only for a  --  BARRIE TREXEL Even if I only last a day  --  an hour  --  you win  --  I lose . I know what I 'm saying  --  and what I 'm risking . Life is hell this way . I 'll take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand again to her . SUSAN slowly puts her hand toward BARRIE 'S . They look deeply at each other . The door at right is opened carefully and BLOSSOM looks in . ) BLOSSOM TREXEL ( timidly ) I thought I heard you talking , Dad . May I come in ? BARRIE TREXEL ( after a pause ) Why not ? BLOSSOM TREXEL May I , Mother ? SUSAN TREXEL As your father says  --  why not ?  --  We were just talking about  --  ( She moves toward the bed  --  seeing BLOSSOM for the first time . BLOSSOM is wearing IRENE 'S pajamas  --  and over these a trailing affair of brilliant green chiffon and black lace . It hangs awkwardly from her shoulders  --  open in front  --  BLOSSOM doing nothing to help it . ) You 're gigantic ! Where on earth did you get that thing ? p. 78 BLOSSOM TREXEL Aunt Irene gave it to me last night . It 's lovely  --  is n't it ? SUSAN TREXEL Take it off . You look like a girl scout  --  gone wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) BLOSSOM TREXEL ( taking off the negligee and throwing it on a chair ) Oh , Mother  --  you are funny ! You look perfectly sweet in yours . Does n't she , Dad ? SUSAN TREXEL I 'm always sweet at seven o'clock in the morning .  --  I 'd give my soul for a cup of coffee . BARRIE TREXEL Shall I ring ? SUSAN TREXEL Certainly not .  --  At this hour ? BARRIE TREXEL I 'll go down to the kitchen and see if I can dig up  --  ( Going to the hall door . ) SUSAN TREXEL No ! Even the cook would n't be down . We 're not supposed to be holding family conferences at dawn . ( There is a pause . ) Well  --  Your father and I have been chatting about happy plans for your summer , Blossom . BLOSSOM TREXEL ( looking dubiously at BARRIE ) Oh . p. 79 SUSAN TREXEL He seems to think you are n't as keen about camp as you used to be . Are n't you ? BLOSSOM TREXEL It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TREXEL If you could what ?  --  Say it  --  Say it ! BLOSSOM TREXEL If I were going to be with you  --  till I go . With you and Dad  --  I mean . SUSAN TREXEL I was going to school to get you today  --  and talk about these things . Arrange something attractive for you  --  as I always do . But your father could n't wait . He 's so anxious for you to be happy , darling . ( SUSAN 'S irony is so cleverly veiled that BLOSSOM is unsuspecting  --  but BARRIE is fully aware  --  and waits in anxious silence to see what SUSAN is going to say . ) So  --  since we 're all gathered together in this delightfully unexpected huddle  --  we may as well settle it now . Pray sit down  --  do .  --  Sit down on something , Barrie . ( She pats the bed beside her for BLOSSOM and flutters her hand toward the chair for BARRIE . BLOSSOM goes to sit beside SUSAN on the bed . BARRIE sits in the armchair at left . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and stay there  --  this summer . That is  --  of course  --  if that is what you would like best . p. 80 BARRIE TREXEL ( quickly ) Your mother suggested that . BLOSSOM TREXEL ( in breathless wonder ) Oh ! SUSAN TREXEL ( looking at BLOSSOM with curiosity and slight hostility ) Do you think you would like that ? BLOSSOM TREXEL All of us ? SUSAN TREXEL Well  --  what there is of us  --  such as we are . BLOSSOM TREXEL You and Dad  --  and me ? ( Her voice breaks slightly . ) SUSAN TREXEL That 's quite enough  --  is n't it ? BLOSSOM TREXEL All summer ? SUSAN TREXEL All summer  --  was your father 's suggestion . BLOSSOM TREXEL Would you like that , Mother ? SUSAN TREXEL I ca n't think of anything more thrilling . BLOSSOM TREXEL ( throwing her arms about SUSAN 'S neck ) Oh , Mother ! p. 81 SUSAN TREXEL ( struggling ) Blossom !  --  You 're choking me ! BLOSSOM TREXEL I think it 's wonderful  --  do n't you , Dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TREXEL Do you think I could ask some of the girls to come for a week-end , Mother  --  sometime  --  maybe ?  --  I mean , of course  --  if it would be perfectly convenient  --  when you are n't having your friends . SUSAN TREXEL Oh  --  never mind my friends ! Why not have the whole school ? Your father would like that . You love playing with the young  --  do n't you , Barrie ? Ping pong  --  basket ball  --  picnics  --  and long tramps in the woods ? BLOSSOM TREXEL Oh , Mummie  --  you are sweet ! Do n't you think it 's just too wonderful , Dad ? ( She slides across the bed to the other side . ) BARRIE TREXEL I do . SUSAN TREXEL Well  --  since the idea seems to please you both  --  so much  --  we may as well begin . We ca n't stay collected under Irene 's roof like this . Is there a caretaker of some sort in the house , Barrie ? p. 82 BARRIE TREXEL Old Maloney and his wife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd love to see you , Mother . They said so . SUSAN TREXEL Would they ?  --  I 'm very touched . BLOSSOM TREXEL I went all over the house . Everything 's all covered up . I love the furniture in my room with the flowers on it . And the bed is too divine . ( She bounces up and down on the bed . ) You ca n't make the beds at school do this . SUSAN TREXEL ( getting off the bed quickly as the rebounding mattress tosses her up ) Must a bed do that ? BARRIE TREXEL You say you think we 'd better go over to the house now , Susan ? SUSAN TREXEL We ca n't stay here  --  a whole army of us . ( BLOSSOM draws in her breath in ecstatic excitement . SUSAN looks at her . ) Is it your teeth , dear ? BLOSSOM TREXEL No  --  I 'm just excited . Are n't you , Mother ? SUSAN TREXEL ( standing before her dressing table  --  and brushing her hair again ) I 'm controlling myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this occasion ?  --  Or will they be too excited to bear it ? p. 83 BARRIE TREXEL I do n't know that there 's anything in the house to eat . BLOSSOM TREXEL Oh , yes , there is  --  ham and eggs . They could n't have been more delicious for dinner last night . BARRIE TREXEL Why do n't you stay here till tomorrow  --  anyway  --  Susan ?  --  Blossom and I will go over and rustle up some  --  SUSAN TREXEL ( with icy sweetness ) Not at all . If we 're going to have this happy summer together  --  the sooner we get at it the better . BLOSSOM TREXEL Oh , Mummie ! BARRIE TREXEL ( looking steadily at SUSAN ) Then we begin now  --  do we  --  with the whole proposition ? SUSAN TREXEL ( going to BARRIE and growing very serious ) If we begin at all  --  why not now ?  --  You 're absolutely sure this is what you want ? BARRIE TREXEL Absolutely . I 'll go over and tell them you 're coming  --  and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is that all right ? SUSAN TREXEL I shall be ready  --  if you are . ( SUSAN and BARRIE look deeply at each other as they shake hands . BARRIE opens the door. ) p. 84 BLOSSOM TREXEL Bye-bye , Dad . BARRIE TREXEL Bye-bye . ( BARRIE goes out  --  closing the door . SUSAN turns slowly and stands staring before her  --  her back to BLOSSOM . A sobered SUSAN  --  with new stern thoughts crowding in on her . ) BLOSSOM TREXEL ( after a moment  --  watching SUSAN wonderingly ) Are you just doing this to be nice to Dad and me , Mother ?  --  I can go back to camp  --  if it 's going to be hard for you . SUSAN TREXEL ( turning towards BLOSSOM ) What makes you say that ? BLOSSOM TREXEL I 'm so terribly sorry about last night . SUSAN TREXEL I do n't want you to talk about it , Blossom . You 're too young to know anything about it . BLOSSOM TREXEL But I do know about it , Mother . I was with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nicer . Everything was perfectly all right till after dinner . Then I could see him getting restless and then  --  it happened . I expect it was partly my fault  --  because I was n't very entertaining . But I know he tried not to do it . Really  --  really I do  --  Mother . p. 85 SUSAN TREXEL ( going to the side of the bed and looking down at BLOSSOM ) I 've tried to keep this away from you , Blossom . BLOSSOM TREXEL Is n't there anything that can be done ? SUSAN TREXEL ( moving away to the window ) Do n't you suppose I 've done everything on earth I could ? It 's broken my heart too  --  but I do n't want it to break yours . ( She closes the window with a little bang . ) Now you must stop thinking about it  --  and be happy . ( She goes back to the dressing table . ) You have to make yourself happy , my dear .  --  You ca n't expect anybody else to do it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anybody but just what they are . ( Turning to look at BLOSSOM . ) Do you understand what I 'm saying to you ? BLOSSOM TREXEL Of course . SUSAN TREXEL Now skip along and get dressed  --  and we wo n't talk about it any  --  Must you wear those glasses all the time ? ( Going to the bed and looking closely at BLOSSOM . ) BLOSSOM TREXEL Not quite all the time . p. 86 SUSAN TREXEL Then the time you do n't wear them will be when you 're with me . Let me see how you look without them . ( BLOSSOM takes off her glasses and gives them to SUSAN . ) Why , your eyes are good . You must learn to make the best of what you 've got . And you surely do n't have to have that thing on your teeth all the time . BLOSSOM TREXEL Oh , yes  --  I do  --  Dr. Ray says  --  SUSAN TREXEL Well , I shall tell Dr. Ray I do n't believe in it for the daytime . All night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glasses on the dressing table . Then she lifts BLOSSOM 'S hair , tucking it up and experimenting with it in different ways . ) If you 're not going to be pretty  --  at least we must make you interesting . It gets a woman further in the long run .  --  If I had some scissors I 'd try something . BLOSSOM TREXEL Mother  --  Dad said you said something that changes the whole world for him . What was it ?  --  What did you say ? SUSAN TREXEL Oh  --  something you would n't understand . ( Moving away and sitting on the foot of the bed . ) BLOSSOM TREXEL There 's one thing I do know . I 'm sure  --  sure  --  sure of it . p. 87 SUSAN TREXEL What ? ( Looking at BLOSSOM  --  arrested by the passionate emotion in her voice . ) BLOSSOM TREXEL When you think somebody does n't love you  --  and then you find out they do  --  it does something wonderful to you . If that could only happen to Dad !  --  Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lap . ) It 's so wonderful to be with you ! ( SUSAN slowly draws BLOSSOM 'S head to her  --  holding her a little uncertainly  --  a new and rather puzzled wonder in her eyes . ) The Curtain Falls p. 88 Act 2 , Scene 2 ACT TWO Scene II Scene : The same as Act One . Time : Ten o'clock  --  the same morning  --  Sunday . The windows onto the terrace are all open and bright sunlight streams into the room . The furniture arrangement is the same as in Act One , Scene I  --  except the glass card table has been removed and an armchair is now at center with a low stool below it . Sunday papers are scattered about the room . At curtain : MIKE and CLYDE are both stretched out in chairs reading the Sunday papers . They are wearing country flannels . CLYDE ROCHESTER ( looking at MIKE over his paper ) How much do you think Barrie will remember about last night ? MICHAEL O'HARA Enough to make him clear out and not face Susan . Leeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( as she comes in from the hall ) Barrie 's gone . Did you know it ? ( IRENE is looking very smart in sport clothes . ) MICHAEL O'HARA So Leeds told me . ( Both men stand up. ) p. 89 IRENE BURROUGHS Awfully early . Where do you s'pose he went ? MICHAEL O'HARA He 's probably in town having a Sunday morning pick-up . Are we going to play golf ? IRENE BURROUGHS ( trying to control her irritability ) I do n't know . I do n't know what I want to do . ( She goes to the couch . ) Sit down !  --  Sit down ! How infernally tired men must be of hopping up because a female comes into the room . ( She sits on the couch and picks up a paper . ) Anything exciting in this ? MICHAEL O'HARA ( sitting again ) Nothing except the market went a little more haywire yesterday . IRENE BURROUGHS I do think they might keep the market out of the Sunday papers and let us have one day of hope . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he was saying last night  --  while he was saying it  --  and meant it . MICHAEL O'HARA Nonsense ! IRENE BURROUGHS Do n't you , Clyde ? CLYDE ROCHESTER Sure he did . The bars were down for him . I could n't help wishing that Susan meant what she was saying  --  and had put out a hand to help him . ( MIKE and IRENE look at each other in surprise. ) p. 90 IRENE BURROUGHS But you do n't think that sort of thing  --  what Susan 's been spouting  --  could do anything for Barrie ? CLYDE ROCHESTER Why not ? Different things for different people . I do n't think it makes much difference what it is ( He goes toward the terrace ) , so long as it 's something to believe in  --  and hang on to . ( He goes out through the open windows onto the terrace at right . ) MICHAEL O'HARA ( looking after CLYDE  --  laughing ) Do n't tell me Susan 's caught a disciple . ( He looks at IRENE . She is frowning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Rising and going towards IRENE . ) IRENE BURROUGHS Nothing . ( She looks at the paper . ) Ha !  --  Connie Ives has just got her divorce and is going to have a baby . I call that bad planning . ( Putting the paper down suddenly . ) I 've been terribly unhappy all my life . Nobody knows anything about anybody else  --  or why anybody does things . If a thing is right for yourself  --  it 's right ! p. 91 MICHAEL O'HARA ( going closer to IRENE ) Well , then  --  that 's all there is to it . IRENE BURROUGHS ( after a pause ) Mike  --  MICHAEL O'HARA Un ? IRENE BURROUGHS Do you think we 're wrong ? MICHAEL O'HARA What 's the matter with you this morning ? IRENE BURROUGHS Do you ? MICHAEL O'HARA Women always get cold feet in the long run  --  and begin to suffer  --  and weigh  --  and consider  --  and wonder if it was worth it . IRENE BURROUGHS Do you think it 's been worth it ? MICHAEL O'HARA Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have waited for my divorce and a stupid wedding ceremony ? Would you have liked that better ? MICHAEL O'HARA ( sitting by her on the couch ) I would n't have liked anything better . I would n't change anything  --  for anything in the world  --  that is  --  not for myself .  --  How about golf ? ( He starts to rise. ) p. 92 IRENE BURROUGHS ( holding his arm ) Not for yourself . But you would change something for me . What ? MICHAEL O'HARA Oh , darling  --  drop this .  --  It 's so  --  IRENE BURROUGHS What would you change for me ? MICHAEL O'HARA ( rising ) Naturally I hate the lying and dodging you 've had to do . I mean I hate it for your sake . IRENE BURROUGHS ( rising and moving across the room ) Do n't let the lying I 've done worry you . I can take care of that . I faced all that in the beginning . MICHAEL O'HARA Then why are you stewing about it now ?  --  If you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BURROUGHS ( turning and facing MIKE quickly ) I sometimes think you wish the whole thing had never happened . I sometimes think it 's been only an affair to you . MICHAEL O'HARA You 've let what Susan said get under your skin . You do mind the talk  --  and that side of it . Since you feel this way about it  --  why do n't you  --  Mind you , I do n't give a hang  --  I 'm only thinking of you . Why do n't you go away  --  Europe or some place  --  till just before we 're married ?  --  That would stop talk and put the whole thing on a different basis . p. 93 IRENE BURROUGHS Nobody needs to do any going away . We 'll call it all off  --  now . I would n't marry you for anything on earth . MICHAEL O'HARA You 're acting like a  --  ( He stops suddenly as CHARLOTTE comes in from the hall . ) CHARLOTTE MARLEY Barrie 's gone . Did you know it ? ( CHARLOTTE is wearing very bright colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes  --  yes  --  we know it . CHARLOTTE MARLEY Where do you s'pose he 's gone ? IRENE BURROUGHS I 'm not supposing . CHARLOTTE MARLEY Do you think he 'll remember what he said and did last night , Mike ? MICHAEL O'HARA ( irritably ) Women always want to know that . What difference does it make whether he remembers or not ? CHARLOTTE MARLEY ( looking from MIKE to IRENE ) I evidently interrupted a row . HUTCHINS STUBBS ( coming in from the hall  --  smiling complacently and looking well fed and well scrubbed ) Good morning ! ( No one speaks to him . ) I take it you 're delighted to see me. p. 94 CHARLOTTE MARLEY ( with exaggerated sweetness ) Oh  --  we are !  --  We are !  --  Good morning , Stubbie , dear . HUTCHINS STUBBS Leeds tells me Barrie went away a little after seven . Where do you suppose he went ? IRENE BURROUGHS ( sitting in the long chair at the right ) If anybody else comes in and says that I 'll throw something at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hall , Irene . " Barrie has gone . " LEONORA STUBBS ( coming in from the hall ) Good morning ! ( LEONORA is looking very beautiful in a pink wool frock . ) CHARLOTTE MARLEY Careful , Leonora  --  we all know Barrie 's gone . LEONORA STUBBS Has he ?  --  What a pity . HUTCHINS STUBBS Why do you say that ? LEONORA STUBBS I sort of had a feeling that things might get right for Susan and him  --  after what happened last night . HUTCHINS STUBBS On the contrary I was convinced last night that it 's impossible for them to go on together . They 're both incurable  --  and they make each other wretched . ( They all speak at once  --  talking about SUSAN and BARRIE  --  and stop suddenly as SUSAN appears in the entrance. ) p. 95 SUSAN TREXEL ' Morning , everybody ! And what a morning ! Did you ever hear the birds carry on so ?  --  Oh  --  ( A pause . ) You 're talking about me . You think what Barrie did last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Divine help comes in the most roundabout ways . ( She goes to MIKE . ) Mike , darling  --  if you had n't been trying to confess  --  I would n't have been saying what I was saying to you . The most marvelous thing has happened  --  the greatest demonstration I have ever  --  Barrie is re-born  --  saved .  --  Wait till you see him . CHARLOTTE MARLEY ( amazed and skeptical ) Where is he  --  now  --  Susan ? SUSAN TREXEL He 's gone over to the house to tell them I 'm coming . MICHAEL O'HARA What house ? SUSAN TREXEL ( sitting on the couch ) Our house ! We 're going to be in it this summer . I simply could n't wait to begin . I had to seize this electrical thing  --  and keep it alive . I 'm plunging right at it  --  to keep them close to me  --  both of them  --  Barrie and Blossom . I 'm so happy I ca n't bear it . Is n't it marvelous , Irene ? p. 96 IRENE BURROUGHS ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe a word of it . SUSAN TREXEL What have I said that you ca n't believe ? IRENE BURROUGHS You do n't think I believe for a second you 're going to live in that huge old barracks of a place that 's been shut up for years . It will be filthy . SUSAN TREXEL Of course it will . I said to Barrie  --  " Never mind the dirt . We 'll throw open the windows and let the sun pour in . " HUTCHINS STUBBS How about getting food in the house  --  it 's Sunday ? SUSAN TREXEL What difference does food make in a spiritual crisis ? CHARLOTTE MARLEY And servants ? SUSAN TREXEL ( rising and going towards the hall ) I 'm going to get Molly Matthews on the phone now and tell her to send me a cook tomorrow and staff the whole house at once . Those are such little unimportant things compared to the great  --  ( She goes to the door and turns . ) Let me know when Barrie gets back . ( She goes out . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the door . They stop quickly . ) Oh  --  you think he is n't coming back . You think he 's tight now . I 'm so sorry for you . Stubbie  --  you look so silly and so unbelieving . ( CLYDE comes in from the terrace . SUSAN points to him . ) Ca n't you see in Clyde 's eyes he has sublimated his love ? Good morning , Clyde . ( She goes out again singing with rather defiant gaiety. ) p. 97 IRENE BURROUGHS ( after a pause ) Do you know what I think ?  --  I bet she and Barrie have had the fight of their lives  --  and she 'd rather die than admit she 's made a monkey of herself . HUTCHINS STUBBS Exactly . Barrie called her hand last night . She 's bluffing to save her face . CHARLOTTE MARLEY She 's not bluffing if she 's going to live in that house with both of them all summer . IRENE BURROUGHS That 's easy . She 'll go over now  --  and leave tomorrow . LEONORA STUBBS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'HARA I 'd like to see Barrie if he is  --  reconditioned . Where do you s'pose he is  --  in this exalted state ? CHARLOTTE MARLEY ( rising and going to the windows ) Let 's hop in the car , Mike , and go over and see if he is at the house . MICHAEL O'HARA ( going to CHARLOTTE and taking her arm ) That 's an idea . ( They go out through the open windows  --  across the outer terrace. ) p. 98 IRENE BURROUGHS I 'm going to see if Susan really is telephoning to Mollie about servants . ( IRENE goes out through the hall . ) LEONORA STUBBS I do n't see why any of it is so hard to believe . HUTCHINS STUBBS You do n't know Susan . LEONORA STUBBS I think something happened to Barrie last night  --  right here before our eyes . I mean something that is going to change him . Do n't you , Clyde ? CLYDE ROCHESTER ( hesitating as LEONORA and STUBBIE look at him ) Maybe  --  Why not ?  --  Nothing 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pack . LEONORA STUBBS What ? CLYDE ROCHESTER You know that picture offer ? LEONORA STUBBS The one you turned down ? CLYDE ROCHESTER They got me on the phone this morning . They 've raised the money . It 's so good I ca n't let it go . It 's been a swell party . I do n't want to leave . Good-bye , Leonora . ( Putting out his hand . ) LEONORA STUBBS ( slapping his hand ) I 'll drive to the station with you . p. 99 CLYDE ROCHESTER A  --  please do n't . I hate station farewells . I 'd rather say good-bye with love and kisses right here . ( STUBBIE turns away a little  --  annoyed . CLYDE goes to him . ) Good-bye , Mr. Stubbs . It 's been swell knowing you . I 've known Leonora for a long time  --  and I  --  ca n't tell you how  --  glad I am about her marriage . It beats the theatre all to pieces  --  for her .  --  Well  --  good-bye . HUTCHINS STUBBS ( taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hall door . ) LEONORA STUBBS Good-bye , Clyde dear ! ( She suddenly throws her arms around his neck and kisses him . CLYDE goes out . ) HUTCHINS STUBBS ( after a pause ) Was that necessary ? LEONORA STUBBS If it had been necessary I would n't have done it .  --  Nobody telephoned him about a picture at all  --  of course . HUTCHINS STUBBS Then why is he going ? LEONORA STUBBS To get out from under  --  not to be in the way  --  between you and me. p. 100 HUTCHINS STUBBS Do you expect me to believe he 's giving you up  --  just walking out  --  like that ? LEONORA STUBBS ( with sudden force ) I expect you to believe he 's done something fine and unselfish . Something that was awfully hard for him to do . HUTCHINS STUBBS Very dramatic . IRENE BURROUGHS ( coming into the hall entrance ) Susan actually did telephone for servants .  --  She went the whole hog  --  cook and butler and everything .  --  Can you beat it ? HUTCHINS STUBBS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with women and their moods and emotions . ( He stalks out onto the terrace . ) IRENE BURROUGHS ( coming down to LEONORA ) Have you and Stubbie had a fight too ?  --  Susan 's got us all at each other 's throats while she herself is floating about on wings . LEONORA STUBBS Would n't it be marvelous if Susan ever finds out that what she 's been gabbling about it true ? IRENE BURROUGHS What ? LEONORA STUBBS It is  --  you know .  --  I want to run .  --  I want to go back to work  --  where I belong . ( BLOSSOM comes in quickly from the terrace. ) p. 101 IRENE BURROUGHS Where did you come from , Blossom ?  --  Good morning . BLOSSOM TREXEL I walked down the road . Good morning . Has Father come back yet ? IRENE BURROUGHS Back from where ? BLOSSOM TREXEL From our house . He went over to tell the caretakers we 're coming . ( LEONORA goes out onto the terrace . ) IRENE BURROUGHS Oh ! Have you seen your father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I were in Mother 's room  --  early  --  and she was making the loveliest plans  --  and father was perfectly all right . He could n't have been nicer .  --  May I have a car  --  Aunt Irene ?  --  I can drive  --  so I could go over and see if he is there ? IRENE BURROUGHS No  --  I wo n't let you . It is n't your business to do this , Blossom . BLOSSOM TREXEL ( her excitement and emotion rising ) Oh , but it is.  --  I ought n't to have let him go alone .  --  Let me have a car , Aunt Irene , please . IRENE BURROUGHS Wait ! Charlotte and Mike have gone . p. 102 BLOSSOM TREXEL Then you do think there 's something wrong ? ( CHARLOTTE and MIKE come in from the terrace . ) IRENE BURROUGHS Was he there ? CHARLOTTE MARLEY He was there early this morning . He had breakfast there . BLOSSOM TREXEL Then what did he do ? MICHAEL O'HARA He said he was coming back here  --  and of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't tell Mother where you 've been .  --  I 'm going down to the gate . ( She goes quickly . ) SUSAN TREXEL ( coming in from the hall . She is carrying her hat , gloves and bag ) Has Barrie come ? ( No one answers her . ) What 's the matter ?  --  Why did Blossom go out ?  --  Is anything the matter ? CHARLOTTE MARLEY Of course not . SUSAN TREXEL There is . Has he come back ?  --  Tell me ! MICHAEL O'HARA Not yet , Susan  --  he has n't had time . SUSAN TREXEL It 's eleven o'clock . I know what you 're thinking . And I do n't want you to let him know you 've been thinking it  --  when he comes . He needs faith  --  all around him . He needs to know we believe he can do it . p. 103 CHARLOTTE MARLEY If you believe in him like that , Susan  --  it will help him more than anything in the world . SUSAN TREXEL I do .  --  Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Daddy 's coming up the drive , Mother . SUSAN TREXEL ( honestly and firmly to the others ) Will you let me see Barrie  --  alone  --  please ? IRENE BURROUGHS Come along , Blossom . ( She puts her arm about BLOSSOM and they go out through the hall . CHARLOTTE and MIKE go onto the terrace . SUSAN stands waiting . After a moment BARRIE comes in from the terrace . He is carrying a bunch of violets . ) BARRIE TREXEL ( going to SUSAN ) This time I bring thee  --  violets . ( He is sober  --  smiling at her with a shy , happy sweetness . She looks at him with hard penetrating eyes . His smile fades . ) Oh  --  you thought I 'd fallen down before I even started . Could n't you trust me for a few hours ? SUSAN TREXEL I 've been lying my head off all morning . They all think you 're drunk again  --  and I said I knew you weren't. p. 104 BARRIE TREXEL But you thought I was . SUSAN TREXEL ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth have you been ?  --  Why did n't you come back when you said you would ?  --  What have you been doing ? BARRIE TREXEL ( shouting back at her ) Digging up Mr. Higgenbottom in the village  --  to get some food in the house . ( Lowering his voice . ) Are you disappointed ?  --  Were you hoping I would come back drunk  --  so you would n't even have to start off on our contract ? Tell me the truth , Susan  --  is that it ? SUSAN TREXEL ( sinking onto the stool in the center of the room ) No  --  it is n't . But I 've been thinking  --  a lot  --  Barrie  --  since our talk . BARRIE TREXEL Have you ? SUSAN TREXEL If you did stop drinking  --  it would be wonderful  --  marvelous  --  and I want you to  --  with all my heart  --  but  --  BARRIE TREXEL But it would n't make you want to live with me again . p. 105 SUSAN TREXEL Not necessarily . But this is what we forgot .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TREXEL That 's not humanly possible . SUSAN TREXEL Oh , but it is . Quite  --  quite possible . You do n't know me very well any more , Barrie . BARRIE TREXEL Do n't I ? SUSAN TREXEL I 've changed a very great deal . BARRIE TREXEL Have you ? SUSAN TREXEL Let 's enter into this perfectly honestly  --  and whatever happens  --  we 'll meet it  --  and be big about it . Whether I want to give you up  --  or you want to give me up . And while we 're going through this , Barrie  --  we 're friends  --  good  --  good  --  friends .  --  Nothing more . BARRIE TREXEL ( quietly ) I wo n't ask anything more .  --  Well  --  at least we know where we are  --  even if we do n't know where we 're going .  --  Let 's collect Blossom and clear out . SUSAN TREXEL ( goes to the hall door and calls ) Irene .  --  Irene  --  we 're going now  --  come and say good-bye . ( She comes back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contradict anything I say .  --  Do n't make an idiot of me again . ( IRENE comes in from the hall . ) Barrie brought these to you , Irene . ( Giving the violets to IRENE . ) That 's one of the things that took him so long  --  picking them . ( BLOSSOM comes back from the hall. ) p. 106 BARRIE TREXEL ( to IRENE ) With my very humble  --  you know .  --  IRENE BURROUGHS Oh , Barrie  --  how sweet of you to bother ! ( CHARLOTTE and MIKE come in from the terrace . ) CHARLOTTE MARLEY Good morning , Barrie . MICHAEL O'HARA Hello , Barrie . BARRIE TREXEL Good morning . I 'm not trying to say anything  --  except that Susan 's being a magnificent sport . SUSAN TREXEL Do n't be silly .  --  Come along . ( She gathers up her hat and bag . ) IRENE BURROUGHS Why do you go before luncheon ? SUSAN TREXEL Oh  --  we 're going to have a marvelous lunch , I adore eating out of a can . Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll give you crackers and rat cheese  --  and you can help take the sheets off the furniture and make up the beds with them . ( CHARLOTTE and MIKE go out onto the terrace . ) BARRIE TREXEL Bye-bye , Irene . Thanks for taking us in. p. 107 BLOSSOM TREXEL Thank you , Aunt Irene . SUSAN TREXEL ( giving BLOSSOM a spank with her bag ) Well  --  here we are .  --  The happy little brood  --  coming home to roost . ( BLOSSOM starts  --  SUSAN following . BARRIE steps in front of BLOSSOM and the three of them go toward the window  --  all in step . ) IRENE BURROUGHS ( calling to SUSAN as she reaches the window ) Susan ! ( SUSAN turns and comes back to IRENE  --  BARRIE and BLOSSOM go on out . ) I take back everything I said . What you 're doing is magnificent . And you 're going to be awfully happy because you are doing it . SUSAN TREXEL Oh , slush , Irene !  --  That 's easy enough for you to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with . IRENE BURROUGHS You 've got them both . They adore you . SUSAN TREXEL And they 're going to hang round my neck all summer and choke me to death .  --  I 'm not made for this , Irene . I do n't know why I 'm doing it .  --  I do n't want to do it  --  at all  --  at all  --  at all .  --  I wish I 'd never heard of God . ( She goes out through the windows as  --  The Curtain Falls @x Scene : SUSAN 'S sitting room  --  in SUSAN 'S house in the country . The walls are paneled in very old wood  --  painted a dull green . The curtains are old silk  --  soft in colors . The furniture is old French  --  graceful and charming . SUSAN 'S desk is piled high with papers and letters  --  in comfortable confusion . The room radiates SUSAN 'S gaiety and style  --  and the ease with which she makes it livable and magnetic . Entrances are through the French windows at center and an archway leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later . Late afternoon . At Curtain : IRENE and SUSAN are seated on the sofa . IRENE is in riding clothes  --  SUSAN in a simple jersey frock . SUSAN TREXEL I was never so glad to see anybody in my life .  --  Why did n't you tell me you were coming home ?  --  Why have n't you written to me ? IRENE BURROUGHS Written to you ?  --  I never expected to speak to you again as long as I live . I had a terrible fight with Mike  --  and cleared out the next day . SUSAN TREXEL But where did you go ? p. 109 IRENE BURROUGHS Norway . SUSAN TREXEL How terrible  --  nothing but scenery !  --  Where 's Mike ?  --  I have n't seen him all summer . IRENE BURROUGHS I have n't seen him yet myself . I gave him up forever when I left  --  and I 've come home to marry him . He 's the only thing I want . Mike 's the answer to everything  --  for me . SUSAN TREXEL Because you did give him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Did n't I tell you ?  --  It 's beautiful !  --  I 'm proud of you , Irene . IRENE BURROUGHS And what about you ?  --  How 's Barrie ? SUSAN TREXEL Barrie 's splendid ! IRENE BURROUGHS You mean  --  he is n't drinking ? SUSAN TREXEL Of course not .  --  Not a drop . IRENE BURROUGHS Susan ! That 's too good to be true . You 've done it then . SUSAN TREXEL Of course , dear . IRENE BURROUGHS I did n't think you 'd last two weeks on the job  --  and it 's been three months . SUSAN TREXEL ( complacently ) It 's been a miracle . Deep and beautiful and profound . p. 110 IRENE BURROUGHS Has your belief made you do this for Barrie ? SUSAN TREXEL I could n't have done it without my belief . It 's sustained me . Do n't think it has n't been a hard job  --  too . IRENE BURROUGHS Of course it has . SUSAN TREXEL Both of them  --  Barrie and Blossom !  --  At first I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BURROUGHS I know . I know . SUSAN TREXEL ( getting up and walking about restlessly ) One night I marched upstairs to leave !  --  And then  --  I did n't . There was a dress of Blossom 's lying on the floor . I picked it up to pitch it out of the  --  But it was just like having Blossom in my hands .  --  You know there 's something awfully queer about it . The more I do for them  --  the better I like them .  --  Blossom 's the sweetest thing you ever  --  But it 's been awful ! ( Going to the fire . ) I have n't been off the place . Do you think I 've had any parties ? The house is filled with youngsters . They swarm and crawl all over the place . Every time I look up from my soup I see one I never saw before .

BLOSSOM TREXEL Mummie  --  we 've run out of sandwiches . Bronson says there 's nothing in the house to make any more unless he takes the caviar you like . SUSAN TREXEL I like ? ( Going to her desk . ) I have n't heard anything about what I like for so long it staggers me.  --  All right  --  take it  --  take it ! ( BLOSSOM is now a very pretty girl  --  without her glasses  --  and without the brace on her teeth . She is wearing tennis shorts and looking radiantly happy . ) BLOSSOM TREXEL ( going to SUSAN to embrace her ) You 're a peach , Mum ! SUSAN TREXEL Go ' way !  --  You 're hot and sticky . ( Giving BLOSSOM a resounding spank . ) It 's coming off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BLOSSOM TREXEL ( rubbing the spank as she goes towards the window ) Why would n't it ? SUSAN TREXEL Hold in your stomach ! ( BLOSSOM jerks in her stomach as she goes out through the window . ) Just as I get her poked in in one spot she pops out in another . IRENE BURROUGHS ( laughing  --  and suddenly becoming serious ) I 'm so glad you and Barrie are together again . SUSAN TREXEL We 're together again  --  but  --  ( Going back to the couch and sitting by IRENE . ) It 's an entirely spiritual relationship . IRENE BURROUGHS All summer in the same house ?  --  You ca n't make me think you 've got as spiritual as all that . SUSAN TREXEL That was our agreement  --  and Barrie has n't broken his word once . IRENE BURROUGHS Be careful !  --  He 'll get another girl . SUSAN TREXEL I hope so . IRENE BURROUGHS What ? SUSAN TREXEL I hope it 's Charlotte . p. 113 IRENE BURROUGHS Charlotte ? SUSAN TREXEL She 's in love with him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's why it 's so perfect . She 's been so useful . Plays golf with him when there is n't anybody else . They 're out now . IRENE BURROUGHS What are you up to ? SUSAN TREXEL I 've saved Barrie  --  and now I want to make him happy . He 's a darling  --  a perfect darling .  --  But I 've outgrown him . Charlotte never will of course . IRENE BURROUGHS All of which means you 're in love with someone else . SUSAN TREXEL ( very exaltedly pleased with herself ) No  --  no  --  you do n't understand , Irene . Something has come to me beyond all that . IRENE BURROUGHS What on earth do you want  --  if you do n't want Barrie  --  now that he 's on his feet again ?  --  What do you want out of life , Susan ? SUSAN TREXEL ( going to sit at her desk ) I ca n't go back to being an ordinary woman again .  --  Lady Wiggam says I have a very rare power . This summer has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  wider  --  The meeting at Newport is going to be marvelous . Brilliant . Heaps of important Americans  --  and as for English titles  --  Lady Wiggam herself is coming over . p. 114 IRENE BURROUGHS ( rising and going to sit opposite SUSAN at the desk ) What have you got to do with it ? SUSAN TREXEL Do with it ?  --  I 've helped organize it .  --  Look at this . ( Putting a hand on the pile of letters and papers on the desk . ) Every time I 've almost given up here  --  I 've thought of this brilliant meeting at Newport  --  It all began with Mike 's confession that night . That was the first time I knew I had this power . IRENE BURROUGHS ( interested and puzzled ) Ah  --  Susan  --  did n't anyone  --  ever tell you about that confession  --  that night ? SUSAN TREXEL ( with superficial seriousness ) No  --  I only know the results . See what it 's done for you  --  and Leonora gave up Stubbie  --  and his money  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a job yet  --  and respects herself .  --  Here  --  Look at Lady Wiggam 's last letter  --  ( Giving IRENE a letter . ) IRENE BURROUGHS ( taking the letter and reading aloud ) " Dear brave spirit  --  ( SUSAN , with a little gesture , indicates herself . ) You have a very rare power . God is working through you to reach thousands of souls . You must n't limit it to one man and one child .  --  You  --  p. 115 CHARLOTTE MARLEY ( coming in from outside ) Good heavens !  --  Look who 's here ! Irene !  --  How grand ! ( BARRIE follows CHARLOTTE in . They are both wearing golf clothes . ) IRENE BURROUGHS ( rising to embrace CHARLOTTE ) Hello , Charlotte !  --  Barrie  --  how are you ? BARRIE TREXEL ( going to IRENE ) This is great , Irene . Where did you drop from ? IRENE BURROUGHS How splendid you look , Barrie ! BARRIE TREXEL Pretty fit , eh ?  --  And so do you . SUSAN TREXEL And is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman who can look so smart in such tweedy tweeds.  --  Do n't you , Irene ? IRENE BURROUGHS I never saw you looking so well , Charlotte . CHARLOTTE MARLEY Something 's wrong .  --  ( Looking down at her clothes as she stands before the fire . ) You two bozos are too enthusiastic . BARRIE TREXEL ( smiling affectionately at CHARLOTTE ) You should have seen Charl hole a seventeen-foot putt today . p. 116 CHARLOTTE MARLEY Yes  --  and miss a one-footer.  --  Where have you been , Irene ? SUSAN TREXEL She 's been sitting on a fiord all summer . BARRIE TREXEL ( about to sit on the arm of the sofa  --  rises quickly ) On a what ? SUSAN TREXEL You know  --  one of those things in Ibsen plays . IRENE BURROUGHS Bye  --  you two  --  see you soon . ( IRENE and SUSAN go out through the window . ) CHARLOTTE MARLEY ( calling to IRENE as they go ) Awfully nice to have you back , Irene . BARRIE TREXEL ( going to CHARLOTTE ) If you 're as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy . CHARLOTTE MARLEY But I wo n't be . I always fall down when I ought to make the shot of my life . BARRIE TREXEL That 's what you do n't do . You 're the best stander-up I know . Do n't think I do n't appreciate the time you 've put in at this  --  this summer , Charl  --  and do n't think I do n't know why you 've done it . And do n't think I do n't know there are a lot of things  --  a lot more fun for you  --  than playing golf with me. p. 117 CHARLOTTE MARLEY And do n't worry about any fun I 've missed .  --  It 's been a swell summer . ( She suddenly becomes self-conscious . ) It 's been good for my game  --  you know  --  playing with you . BARRIE TREXEL ( pointing to her wrist-watch ) If we do win the match you 're going to have the best time-piece going  --  and scrap that in the junk heap . CHARLOTTE MARLEY I would n't part with  --  ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Barrie 's sorry for me . He wants me to have a real one  --  ( Holding up her wrist to show the watch. ) if we win the match .  --  Well  --  I must hop it . ( She starts up to the window . ) I 've got to feed my dogs . SUSAN TREXEL ( going to her desk ) No  --  you must n't ! You 've got to stay for dinner and play backgammon with Barrie . I must get this mess straight by morning . ( Indicating the papers on the desk . ) This is Newport . And this is Blossom 's birthday party . ( Touching two different piles of papers. ) p. 118 CHARLOTTE MARLEY ( going to one end of the desk ) Newport looks a little hectic . SUSAN TREXEL Oh , Charlotte  --  have you thought of any more boys for the party ?  --  I 'm rapidly losing my mind . ( She rummages among the papers . ) Before I got myself into this  --  I innocently thought a boy apiece would be magnificent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to every girl the party 's a flop before we begin . ( She opens a desk drawer and pulls out handfuls of letters . ) Oh  --  where is that list ? CHARLOTTE MARLEY ( picking up a piece of paper from the desk ) Here it is . SUSAN TREXEL ( taking the paper ) No , it isn't.  --  That 's last week 's  --  when I was being particular . I began with the social register . Now I 'm using the telephone book . ( She tears the paper to bits and throws it in the waste paper basket . ) BLOSSOM TREXEL ( coming back ) Charlotte  --  will you come and see Scottie before you go ?  --  He wo n't eat his dinner . p. 119 BARRIE TREXEL What 's the matter with him , darling ? BLOSSOM TREXEL Everyone was throwing him things this afternoon because he catches so well . BARRIE TREXEL What were they throwing ? BLOSSOM TREXEL Chocolates and caviar sandwiches . BARRIE TREXEL Well  --  all Scottie has to do to keep up the game is throw ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window ) Let 's have a look at him . Do n't come out , Barrie . Three o'clock tomorrow on the first tee . ( BLOSSOM goes out . ) BARRIE TREXEL ( going to CHARLOTTE ) I 'll be there . Suppose I pick you up at twelve and we 'll have lunch at " The House in the Woods "  --  Will you come along , Susan ? SUSAN TREXEL Oh  --  do n't mind me . ( Smiling sweetly  --  and watching them alertly . ) BARRIE TREXEL Twelve-thirty then , Charl . CHARLOTTE MARLEY Righto !  --  Night-night . ( CHARLOTTE goes . BARRIE stands looking out after her. ) p. 120 SUSAN TREXEL ( after a pause  --  watching BARRIE from her desk ) Something 's happened to Charlotte . Lately she has real charm  --  Do n't you think ? BARRIE TREXEL She 's got more than that . SUSAN TREXEL What ? BARRIE TREXEL ( going to the fire and lighting a pipe ) Character . SUSAN TREXEL Oh  --  that !  --  I mean the real thing  --  sexy charm . BARRIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody has n't married her . SUSAN TREXEL Charlotte 's the kind men fall in love with when they grow older .  --  After they get over all that  --  ( Swaying alluringly and expressively. ) and grow more intelligent . BARRIE TREXEL ( smiling across at SUSAN as he stands with his back to the fire ) Unfortunately intelligence has nothing to do with love  --  at any age . SUSAN TREXEL Meaning that 's why you fell in love with me ? BARRIE TREXEL That 's one of the reasons . p. 121 BLOSSOM TREXEL ( coming back through the window ) It 's all right  --  Scottie did . ( Putting her hands on her stomach to indicate what Scottie has done . ) Mother  --  Bobby 's going to stay for dinner  --  do you mind ? SUSAN TREXEL Not really ! BLOSSOM TREXEL May he have one of your shirts , Dad ?  --  His is wet . BARRIE TREXEL Tell him to help himself . ( BLOSSOM goes out through the hallway . BARRIE calls to her . ) Ask him if he 'd mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their idea of borrowing is to send back some other fellow 's shirt  --  if any . SUSAN TREXEL ( laughing at BARRIE and crossing to the small table by the sofa to get a cigarette ) You asked for it , darling . BARRIE TREXEL Does n't Bobby stay for dinner pretty often ? SUSAN TREXEL Oh  --  you 've noticed it then .  --  Only six nights a week . BARRIE TREXEL What does that mean ? SUSAN TREXEL ( sitting on the sofa as she lights her cigarette ) It means he likes our daughter  --  and our food . p. 122 BARRIE TREXEL ( walking about as he tries to say something which makes him shy ) Have you talked to her about  --  SUSAN TREXEL About what ? BARRIE TREXEL You know darned well what about . SUSAN TREXEL ( making herself comfortable on the sofa  --  her feet up ) Oh  --  that !  --  I 've done my entire maternal duty . When she was seven I gave her a book about the wind and the pollen and the flowers . ( She laughs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TREXEL No kidding . She 's getting to be a very attractive girl . Do n't you think it 's kind of dangerous to let her  --  SUSAN TREXEL ( laughing as she teases him ) Forty is the dangerous age , lamb . She 's got several safe years yet .  --  Oh  --  you 're so cunning  --  being a parent . But if you 're going to think up any more things for parents to do  --  you do them .  --  I ca n't take on anything more . BARRIE TREXEL ( going to the desk  --  his back to SUSAN ) You 've done a swell job this summer , Susan . I bet there 've been times when you wanted to walk out on us  --  and you 've never let us know it . p. 123 SUSAN TREXEL ( sitting up with sudden interest ) The summer 's almost over , Barrie . Blossom goes back to school in three weeks . Let 's not put off till the last minute  --  the things we have to say to each other . BARRIE TREXEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to SUSAN ) Well  --  what have we got to say to each other ? SUSAN TREXEL You must have something very important to say to me . BARRIE TREXEL ( fingering a paper knife he picks up from the desk ) Not a thing  --  but thank you . I 've managed to pull through  --  so far . SUSAN TREXEL It 's marvelous what you 've done , darling . Coming home so fit and sure  --  every  --  You are  --  perfectly sure of yourself now  --  are n't you ? BARRIE TREXEL I guess so .  --  Thanks to you . SUSAN TREXEL And Charlotte .  --  She 's helped  --  has n't she ? BARRIE TREXEL You bet . She stands up there and swats that ball and pretends she 'd rather play golf with me than anything going . p. 124 SUSAN TREXEL It 's too sweet for me to have to tell you . BARRIE TREXEL Tell me what ? SUSAN TREXEL ( rising and going to BARRIE ) Charlotte 's in love with you , dear  --  and I think you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BARRIE TREXEL ( throwing down the paper knife and looking into SUSAN 's eyes ) Leave Charlotte out of this .  --  You mean the jig is up  --  for you and me . SUSAN TREXEL I would n't put it that way . BARRIE TREXEL ( in quiet level tones ) How would you put it ? SUSAN TREXEL Well  --  we 've done what we said we would  --  and  --  BARRIE TREXEL And drunk or sober  --  you 're through with me . SUSAN TREXEL That sounds horrid . I love you in a new way  --  spiritually  --  and I want you to be happy . BARRIE TREXEL Thanks !  --  Thanks a lot . ( He starts out through the hall ) p. 125 SUSAN TREXEL ( calling ) Barrie !  --  Ca n't we be adult about this ? Ca n't we tell each other the truth honestly  --  as we said we would ? BARRIE TREXEL ( coming back to face SUSAN at the other side of the desk ) Sure we can .  --  Have you any more truth to tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to know that you 're free to do what you want to do  --  and I 'm free to do what will fill up my life . BARRIE TREXEL And what will fill up your life , Susan ? SUSAN TREXEL ( going up to the window and then to the sofa ) My work ! Oh , Barrie  --  this summer has been good for me.  --  I 've reached a great understanding . I 'll go to Newport enriched because of it . ( SUSAN is trying to believe herself  --  and to impress BARRIE . ) BARRIE TREXEL ( dryly and suspiciously ) You will ? SUSAN TREXEL ( as importantly as possible ) Immeasurably ! BARRIE TREXEL How long will you be in Newport ? p. 126 SUSAN TREXEL ( sitting on the sofa ) A week . BARRIE TREXEL A week ? SUSAN TREXEL Of course .  --  Why ? BARRIE TREXEL That 's an awful slice out of Blossom 's three . Could n't you make it a day or so ? SUSAN TREXEL Certainly not .  --  They need me  --  all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmness coming into his voice . ) SUSAN TREXEL That 's a little way to look at it . BARRIE TREXEL ( trying to keep his own sick heartbreak out of this ) Is it ?  --  Well I think Blossom 's big . I think she 's the biggest thing in your life . SUSAN TREXEL You ca n't compare the two at all . Do n't you think it 's more important to reach out to thousands of souls  --  than it is to stay at home one more week  --  with one child ? BARRIE TREXEL ( his emotion rising ) It might be  --  Yes  --  you bet it might !  --  But I ca n't kid myself into thinking that you 've got a great message to take to anybody . I 'm damned sure you can make Blossom terrifically happy  --  and I think that 's your job . p. 127 SUSAN TREXEL But I shall be back for her party  --  that 's Monday  --  the twenty-sixth . BARRIE TREXEL Saturday is the twenty-sixth . SUSAN TREXEL Oh , no , it is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk ) Of course it is . SUSAN TREXEL ( rushing across to BARRIE ) Let me see .  --  I thought Monday was the twenty-sixth . It must be . ( Taking the calendar from him . ) There must be some mistake . BARRIE TREXEL There it is . ( BARRIE leaves SUSAN with the calendar and goes to the fire . ) SUSAN TREXEL But , I ca n't be here Saturday  --  I ca n't ! BARRIE TREXEL ( turning with sudden passionate force ) You 've got to !  --  There wo n't be any party for her  --  without you . SUSAN TREXEL ( throwing the calendar across the room ) There 'll have to be !  --  I 've given up my entire summer  --  you surely ca n't expect me to give up any more . ( She walks about as BARRIE watches her . ) I have to go !  --  It 's been announced . ( Going to back of her desk . ) Heaps and heaps of important people are going to be there just because I  --  Saturday is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BARRIE TREXEL ( suspiciously  --  after a pause ) What are you going to do ? SUSAN TREXEL In my own humble little way  --  I 'm going to tell how I found God . BARRIE TREXEL Are you going to talk about yourself ? SUSAN TREXEL ( going on headlong  --  trying to convince herself that she is right ) Of course . That 's its power  --  telling the truth about ourselves . If we have something to give  --  and do n't give it  --  we 're holding back something that could help other people .  --  We  --  BARRIE TREXEL ( with insistent quietness ) What are you going to tell ? SUSAN TREXEL Well  --  I  --  why  --  BARRIE TREXEL Well  --  what ? SUSAN TREXEL I 'm going to tell them what you 've gone through  --  and how gloriously it 's turned out . BARRIE TREXEL ( his horrified resentment beginning ) You 're going to what ? p. 129 SUSAN TREXEL ( going closer to him ) All sorts of people will be there  --  who know us  --  know all about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you  --  they 'll have to believe it . BARRIE TREXEL You ca n't do that , Susan . SUSAN TREXEL Why not ? BARRIE TREXEL It is n't anybody 's business what 's happened to me . SUSAN TREXEL But it is . We have no right to hide a thing that 's helped us . ( Their voices rise with their emotion . ) BARRIE TREXEL You ca n't do that , Susan  --  I forbid it ! SUSAN TREXEL You ca n't ! BARRIE TREXEL I do ! SUSAN TREXEL ( at full tide ) You 're trying to stop my work  --  God 's work . BARRIE TREXEL ( at last telling SUSAN the truth  --  his shyness gone  --  his intelligence on fire ) I do n't think you know anything about God , Susan . It 's colossal nerve for you to stand up and talk to people who do . p. 130 SUSAN TREXEL Stop , Barrie ! BARRIE TREXEL I 've tried with everything in me to believe this meant the real thing to you  --  but I ca n't . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SUSAN TREXEL How can you say that  --  after what God has done for you ? BARRIE TREXEL Well  --  what has He done for me ? SUSAN TREXEL Barrie ! BARRIE TREXEL I 've bucked up and hung on this summer  --  because I was fool enough to think it would get you back .  --  Well  --  that 's a flop !  --  We 've cracked up !  --  What the hell  --  what 's it all about anyway ? ( BARRIE goes out quickly through the window . SUSAN stands amazed  --  staring after him  --  as  --  The Curtain Falls p. 131 Act 3 , Scene 2 ACT THREE Scene II Scene : The same room . Time : Two days later  --  about nine o'clock in the evening . The fire and the lights are lighted . At Curtain : LEONTINE , a maid , is emptying an ash-tray into the fire . She replaces the tray on the table by the sofa and goes to the windows to draw the curtains . BLOSSOM comes in quickly from the hall . She is wearing a simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the telephone which is on the desk  --  she stops as she sees LEONTINE . LEONTINE ( speaking with a slight French accent ) Pardon , Mademoiselle  --  Bronson told me to ask you  --  do you know yet if your father  --  if he will be back for this evening  --  do you know , Mademoiselle ? BLOSSOM TREXEL ( hesitating ) We 're not  --  quite  --  sure  --  yet . I think so  --  of course . LEONTINE Merci , Mademoiselle . ( She goes out through the hall . ) BLOSSOM TREXEL ( taking the receiver from the phone  --  kneeling on the chair back of the desk and speaking quickly and very quietly ) Three  --  nine hundred .  --  Nine  --  yes . ( After a pause . ) Hello  --  Is this " The House in the Woods " ?  --  Is it Mr. LaFarge speaking ?  --  This is Blossom Trexel.  --  I 'm sorry to trouble you again , Mr. LaFarge  --  but has n't my father been there yet ?  --  Well  --  he  --  he  --  might be there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ask him to call up his daughter  --  at once  --  please ?  --  Yes  --  and  --  ( Lowering her voice . ) If  --  if everything is n't quite  --  all right  --  I mean if he should be a little bit  --  sick  --  or something  --  will you please call me yourself ?  --  Right away ?  --  And do n't speak to anyone else  --  please .  --  Thank you  --  ( She puts up the receiver quickly as SUSAN comes in. ) p. 132 SUSAN TREXEL Was that your father ? BLOSSOM TREXEL No . SUSAN TREXEL What were you doing ? BLOSSOM TREXEL ( sitting at the desk ) I was talking to the same man at " The House in the  --  " SUSAN TREXEL I told you not to !  --  What did he say ? BLOSSOM TREXEL He says Father has n't been there at all . SUSAN TREXEL ( walking about restlessly ) Of course he has n't . That 's the last place on earth he would go .  --  And stop this telephoning and making people think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fear and suffering in SUSAN 'S voice . ) BLOSSOM TREXEL I just did . SUSAN TREXEL I told you not to .  --  What did Katie say this time ? BLOSSOM TREXEL Exactly the same things she 's said every time .  --  Father stopped for Charlotte at eleven o'clock yesterday morning and they went off to " The House in the  --  " SUSAN TREXEL But they did n't . ( She opens one of the windows and goes out onto the lawn. ) p. 133 BLOSSOM TREXEL But that 's what Charlotte told Katie  --  and they were going to play the match in the afternoon . The other people were ready and waited for them . SUSAN TREXEL ( coming back into the room ) Did you ask Katie again what Charlotte took with her ? BLOSSOM TREXEL Nothing but her golf shoes ! SUSAN TREXEL I think Katie is lying . BLOSSOM TREXEL I believe her . This time she was crying . She thinks they 've been killed . SUSAN TREXEL ( pacing back and forth ) Nonsense ! I wish I thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drives brilliantly . BLOSSOM TREXEL But he 's so reckless when he 's  --  SUSAN TREXEL But he was n't . He was n't drinking . Do n't say that again .  --  I wish I were as sure of everything as I am of that . ( She sits on the stool in front of the fire  --  huddled and cold . ) I do n't see why you should lose faith in him like that . BLOSSOM TREXEL I think I heard someone  --  ( Starting to the hall. ) p. 134 SUSAN TREXEL ( rising quickly ) Do n't go out there . Let him come in here if he has come . ( She sits on the sofa  --  listening . ) He hasn't.  --  Do n't go away , Blossom . Stay here  --  with me . ( She shivers . ) BLOSSOM TREXEL ( going to SUSAN quickly ) Are you cold , Mother ? SUSAN TREXEL No  --  Yes  --  of course I am . Why should n't I be cold ? ( BLOSSOM gets a sweater from a chair back of the sofa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party . ( SUSAN holds BLOSSOM 'S hands as they put the sweater over her shoulders . ) BLOSSOM TREXEL That 's all right , Mum . Forget it . SUSAN TREXEL It is n't all right . I was a pig  --  pig  --  pig !  --  But there was a big reason why I was cross .  --  If your father had only waited I would have told him I was giving it up .  --  I 'm making the supreme sacrifice of my life .  --  But he was so strong . He told me I could not do it . BLOSSOM TREXEL Was he right ? p. 135 SUSAN TREXEL No  --  he was n't right  --  he was strong . I never saw anything so strong . That 's why I know he could n't be drinking . BLOSSOM TREXEL But , Mother  --  what else could make him go off like this and not tell us ?

SUSAN TREXEL Oh , would n't she ?  --  Women do these things . BLOSSOM TREXEL But how could Father  --  SUSAN TREXEL ( rising and going to the fire ) Oh  --  these things happen  --  to men . Charlotte began it . BLOSSOM TREXEL What are you going to do ? SUSAN TREXEL ( walking about again ) I shall be forced to divorce him  --  of course . p. 136 BLOSSOM TREXEL Oh , Mother ! SUSAN TREXEL You 'll have to accept it , Blossom .  --  After all  --  you 've had the same father and mother longer than most people have . BLOSSOM TREXEL ( quietly  --  after a pause ) Yes  --  I have . Nearly every girl in school has only got one of them  --  at a time . Not both together at once . And when you like both of them it mixes things up so . ( Suddenly  --  looking at SUSAN . ) I 'll stay with you  --  some  --  wo n't I , Mum ? SUSAN TREXEL ( startled ) You 'll be with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? BLOSSOM TREXEL But I 'll have to be with Dad most . SUSAN TREXEL ( with a fierce new jealousy ) Blossom ! Do you love your father more than you do me ? ( Sitting beside BLOSSOM again . ) BLOSSOM TREXEL No , Mother  --  not more  --  but somebody will have to be with him . SUSAN TREXEL He 'll have Charlotte . p. 137 BLOSSOM TREXEL I mean someone who belongs to him  --  who always has belonged  --  from the beginning .  --  Why could n't it keep on the way it was ?  --  It 's been so wonderful with both of you . I was going to be so proud when I went back to school and said we 'd all been together the whole summer .  --  Oh , Mother . ( Her voice breaks as she puts her head in SUSAN 'S lap . ) I thought everything was all right . SUSAN TREXEL ( putting her arms about BLOSSOM , slowly ) I 've liked this summer too , dear .  --  It 's been sweet  --  sweet  --  having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SUSAN TREXEL Yes  --  Oh  --  but I 've grown so  --  and your father is n't very intellectual . BLOSSOM TREXEL ( raising her head ) Neither are you , Mum . SUSAN TREXEL ( giving her a little slap and drawing away from her ) What ? BLOSSOM TREXEL You do n't need to be . You get everything you want anyway . p. 138 SUSAN TREXEL Do n't be silly ! I give up  --  up  --  up  --  all the time . I try to make things right for other people  --  and they change things . Look at this .  --  I did n't plan this at all . BLOSSOM TREXEL Then how did it happen ?  --  I thought God was helping you this summer . SUSAN TREXEL ( rising ) He sometimes does very peculiar things . BLOSSOM TREXEL ( hearing a noise in the hall ) There 's Dad . ( IRENE comes in from the hall excitedly . She is wearing a long sport coat over her dinner gown . ) IRENE BURROUGHS Have you heard anything ? SUSAN TREXEL Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How could I ? SUSAN TREXEL You seem terribly excited !  --  What 's the matter ? ( IRENE hesitates . ) Run along , Blossom , dear . ( BLOSSOM goes out through the hall . ) IRENE BURROUGHS ( after BLOSSOM has gone ) What have you decided by this time ?  --  Is he drunk  --  or has he eloped with Charlotte ? p. 139 SUSAN TREXEL It 's Charlotte  --  of course . IRENE BURROUGHS You 're getting just what you deserve , Susan . SUSAN TREXEL What ? IRENE BURROUGHS You 're getting a dose of your own medicine  --  busting up other people 's lives . SUSAN TREXEL What do you  --  IRENE BURROUGHS ( her anger rising ) If you 'd let Mike and me alone  --  if you 'd minded your own damned business  --  we 'd have been married by this time . SUSAN TREXEL Why ?  --  What 's happened ? IRENE BURROUGHS He 's going to marry somebody else . SUSAN TREXEL Irene !  --  Oh , no !  --  I 'm sorry . IRENE BURROUGHS If I had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding Mike in the only way he can be held .

That 's why it happened .  --  I was a fool  --  fool  --  fool to let anything you said affect me.  --  It was right  --  for me . It was right !  --  You do n't know what 's right for other people . p. 140 SUSAN TREXEL ( honestly moved and shocked ) But , Irene  --  I was trying to help you . IRENE BURROUGHS Why have n't you helped yourself ?  --  I 'm glad Barrie did wake up . I 'm glad he has got someone who will appreciate him . Charlotte will make a darned good wife for him . SUSAN TREXEL You know you and Mike were wrong .  --  You know it . IRENE BURROUGHS If you had only let us alone  --  we would have worked it out our own way .  --  If you  --  ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She is wearing the clothes of Scene I. ) CHARLOTTE MARLEY ( quietly  --  after a pause ) Barrie 's here . I asked him to let me speak to you first , Susan . IRENE BURROUGHS ( starting to go ) I 'll  --  CHARLOTTE MARLEY ( coming farther into the room ) Do n't go , Irene . I think it would be good if you  --  I 'd like you to hear what I have to say  --  if you do n't mind , Susan . p. 141 SUSAN TREXEL ( in controlled tones ) Why not ?  --  It does n't matter in the least what you have to say , Charlotte . CHARLOTTE MARLEY Oh , yes , it does . If you knew the actual truth of why this happened  --  you would n't be so  --  ( SUSAN and CHARLOTTE face each other across the desk . ) SUSAN TREXEL I do know . I know you 've pretended to be helping him all summer . That was you  --  ( Their voices rise as they speak together . ) SUSAN TREXEL A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARLEY You listen to me , Susan ! IRENE BURROUGHS Stop it ! Everybody in the house will hear you . CHARLOTTE MARLEY Let me talk , will you ? SUSAN TREXEL Of course I will . You 're in love with him  --  are n't you ?  --  You began it  --  did n't you ?  --  In my house  --  right before my  --  p. 142 IRENE BURROUGHS Susan  --  let Charlotte say what she 's  --  SUSAN TREXEL What can she say ?  --  I know all about it . CHARLOTTE MARLEY You 're talking the wildest rot . SUSAN TREXEL Do you deny you 're in love with Barrie ? Do you ? CHARLOTTE MARLEY ( very quietly  --  after a pause ) No  --  I do n't deny it .  --  I always have been and I always shall be . SUSAN TREXEL Do you deny that you began it ?  --  That you meant from the beginning to get him ?  --  Do you ? CHARLOTTE MARLEY Yes !  --  I deny that ! That is n't true . But I 'll tell you this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I 'll go after him  --  and I 'll get him  --  if I can .  --  Will you take me home , Irene ? IRENE BURROUGHS Surely . ( CHARLOTTE goes out through the hall . ) Now you know how I feel . SUSAN TREXEL ( after a long pause ) It is n't the same thing at all . You do n't know anything about it . p. 143 IRENE BURROUGHS Oh , do n't I ?  --  I know I 've lost Mike . SUSAN TREXEL That 's very different . You were n't married to Mike .  --  You have n't got Blossom . You have n't had them both all summer . ( She moves slowly about the room  --  taking it in . ) You have n't been here in this room  --  alone  --  with them , both  --  adoring you  --  depending on you . You have n't felt strange  --  new  --  funny little minutes of peace  --  that you never knew anything about before . That only comes after  --  a long time  --  of seeing it through . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Till another woman got him away from you . SUSAN TREXEL ( speaking through her deep tears  --  with naked simplicity ) No  --  I did n't . I did n't know anything .  --  Everything I 've been gabbling about is true . It is ! It is !  --  I know that now . Life has come straight back at me . All the things I 've been running away from  --  are the only ones I want now . ( She sits on the stool before the fire  --  broken and honest . ) IRENE BURROUGHS ( deeply touched as she listens to SUSAN ) Life 's come back at me all right . I was n't fair just now  --  Susan . It was n't anything you said that made me lose Mike . It 's myself .  --  The way I 've lived . ( After a moment BARRIE comes in from the hall. ) p. 144 BARRIE TREXEL Are you going to drive Charlotte home  --  Irene ? IRENE BURROUGHS Yes  --  I am . SUSAN TREXEL ( getting up quickly from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ?  --  Why do n't you let Barrie take her ? IRENE BURROUGHS Good night , Susan . ( SUSAN does n't answer . ) Good night , Barrie . ( She touches BARRIE 'S arm as she goes out . ) BARRIE TREXEL ( after a pause  --  coming further into the room ) How much did Charlotte tell you ? SUSAN TREXEL ( keeping her back to BARRIE ) She did n't need to tell me anything . She admits she 's in love with you  --  always has been and always will be . BARRIE TREXEL Did she say that ? SUSAN TREXEL She did  --  and that she 'll get you if she can . ( She turns to look at him . ) Well  --  if she has n't got you now , darling  --  what more can she do ? BARRIE TREXEL Nothing . She was great . p. 145 SUSAN TREXEL ( as casually as possible ) Did she do it ?  --  Did she suggest going off ? BARRIE TREXEL ( keeping his eyes away from SUSAN ) She evidently did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her in the morning . I began the night before  --  after we had our fight . ( SUSAN looks at BARRIE . He goes on in dead level tones without stopping . SUSAN listens  --  watching him intently  --  so intently she scarcely breathes . ) But she did n't hesitate to get in the car and go off with me . She did the driving and we kept going  --  till I 'd lapped up all I had with me . We landed at some little Inn and she put us up as Mr. and Mrs. Somebody  --  and she stayed with me  --  till I slept it off  --  and today she drove three hundred miles to bring me back  --  and there it is . SUSAN TREXEL ( after a pause ) Oh ! ( She goes to the couch and sits  --  a little limp . ) Charlotte was big  --  was n't she ? BARRIE TREXEL She was . SUSAN TREXEL She stood by you  --  and saw you through .  --  You slipped because I failed you . p. 146 BARRIE TREXEL Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . SUSAN TREXEL This had to happen  --  and it will happen again  --  but what of it ?  --  You 've done the hard part  --  three whole months  --  coming home so fit  --  and strong  --  You 're not going to let this once make you think you ca n't win out  --  are you ? BARRIE TREXEL Oh  --  do n't be sorry for me . We 'll get down to cases tomorrow . Everything will be all right for you , Susan  --  and exactly as you want it . Good night . ( He goes towards the hall . ) SUSAN TREXEL ( calling to him ) Barrie !  --  Wait  --  I have something to tell you . ( He stops in the doorway and turns back . ) Turn out those lights  --  please . ( SUSAN puts a hand over her eyes . BARRIE turns out the brackets  --  leaving the room lighted from the lamp on the desk . He comes slowly toward her and waits . ) You do n't know how rotten I 've been . At first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TREXEL ( quietly ) I know . I know you did . p. 147 SUSAN TREXEL And then  --  when you did n't  --  and did n't  --  I began to be awfully pleased with myself and think I was doing it . BARRIE TREXEL Do n't try to buck me up . SUSAN TREXEL I know my own stupidity has done all this to me . I know you 're tired of my selfishness . Barrie , tell me the absolute truth . Are you in love with Charlotte ? BARRIE TREXEL I 'm very fond of Charlotte . If she wants to try to pull along with me  --  why not ?  --  I 'm very grateful to Charlotte . SUSAN TREXEL Oh  --  then you 're not in love with her . BARRIE TREXEL I like her  --  which is a damned sight more important . SUSAN TREXEL Oh  --  I want to be so much more to you than I 've ever been before .  --  Please let me try again . BARRIE TREXEL I 'm not worth hanging on to . You know that . SUSAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is something out there  --  to pray to .  --  I think He 's here  --  in us . And I do n't believe He helps one bit  --  till we dig and dig and dig  --  to get the rottenness out of us . ( She rises and goes close to him . ) Barrie  --  hold me . ( She sinks against BARRIE  --  he puts his arms about her  --  holding her close . ) Oh , dear God  --  do n't let me fall down again . The Curtain Falls
