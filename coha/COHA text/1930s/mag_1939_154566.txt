One day last week , Franklin Roosevelt appointed three of the six Executive Assistants with a " passion for anonymity " whom the Reorganization Act allows him . When the news came out one astute reporter dashed over to the white marble palace of the Federal Reserve Board . He wanted to be the first to bring the good news to the President 's new economic adviser . He was . Economist Lauchlin ( " Lauch " ) Currie , a man whose economic ideas will henceforth be of No. 1 concern to U. S. business , thanked him . <P> Anything but a politico is new Assistant Currie . Short , Scottish Nova Scotian Currie went to the London School of Economics , thence to graduate work at Harvard . Duly Ph.D . ' d , he taught Harvard boys from 1927 to 1934 that the purpose of business is profit . In 1934 , Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr . ' s then economic soothsayer ( and still his privy counselor ) , conservative Chicago Professor Jacob ( Balanced Budget ) Viner , induced Currie to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chairman Marriner Stoddard ( Unbalanced Budget ) Eccles of the Federal Reserve Board spotted Currie for his technical qualifications , made him Assistant Director of Research and Statistics and personal adviser . <P> As No. 1 Federal Reserve economic troubleshooter , Currie quickly won recognition inside political brain-picking circles . But not till May 1939 ( via his becharted Temporary National Economic Committee testimony on capital investment ) did nation-wide public recognition come for his analytical prowess . <P> Highlights of his TNEC presentation ( which earned him a fan letter from John Maynard Keynes ) were his demonstrations that : <P> 1 ) Political misgivings did not prevent businessmen from investing $5,341,000,000 in new equipment ( distinguished from plant ) in 1937 . This was 94% as much as in 1929 , more than any previous year . Currie 's argument : investment still follows production , not the editorial page . <P> 2 ) During the prosperous Republican Twenties , while Washington boasted balanced budgets , State and local governments were running up debt at the rate of nearly $1,000,000,000 yearly ; since 1932 , however , State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been piling them up . Carrie 's argument : the net Federal investment now has to be at least $1,000,000,000 to provide equivalent purchasing power . <P> Lauch Currie probably comes nearer to having a passion for anonymity than any other New Deal adviser . First evidence of Currie 's growing technical weight in Washington came in the spring of 1938 , when he wrote an influential memo on the Causes of the Recession . Its prime theses , now commonplace : 1 ) U. S. Social Security taxes took so much out of the public pocketbook that the Government 's net contribution was reduced during the crucial March-September period in 1937 to a monthly average of $60,000,000 from $335,000,000 during 1936. 2 ) " Compensatory " Federal spending to stimulate heavy industry might be more flexible if concentrated " in large part outside the regular budget .
