txt Construction costs of small homes , the subject of a lot of talking but not much action , have been dropping quite rapidly as far as materials are concerned during the last couple of years . On the other hand , labor costs have continued to climb higher during most of the period . Like the king 's men , costs of materials and labor marched up the hill shoulder to shoulder from January . 1936. to the late summer of 1937. but there they broke ranks with material costs marching down again , while labor costs climbed even higher . Data collected by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board tells the story . Covering costs in 90 representative cities , one-third of which report each month , for a standard detached sixroom frame house with a volume of 24,000 cubic feet , the data is based on about 110 material items and nine major labor groups costs for which are obtained from the same dealers , reputable contractors and operative builders . The data has been reduced to index numbers with monthly average for 1936 being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 1936 , with an index figure of 98.7 , material costs mounted steadily month by month to 104.0 in January , 1937. and continued on up to a high of 110 6 in August , 1937 , for a rise of 12% . Labor costs kept pace , starting in January , 1936 at 98.1. reaching 102.7 in January , 1937 , 110.9 in August , 1937 , and continuing on up with only minor interruptions , despite the abrupt decline in volume of residential construction starting in the early summer of 1937 , to a high of 112.4 reached in September , 1938 . Meanwhile , material costs were falling month by month and almost as rapidly as they had risen during the abortive building boom of 1936 and early 1937 . By January . 1938 , this index was down to 107.2 , it hit 103.0 in January , 1939 , steadied for three months , and dropped again to 102.5 by June , 1939 or only 3.8% above the January , 1936 low . Labor costs , however , fluctuated from September , 1938. to March , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 111.3 in June , 1939. where the index was 13.4% above the January , 1936 , low . Effect of all this was to raise the combined cost index for the type of house in question from 98.5 in January , 1936 , to a high of 110.7 in August , 1937. and then to lower the cost to 105.4 in June , 1939 , where it was 7.0% above the January , 1936 , low . Have Cut Total Costs It is clear that the decline in material costs , which account for about two-thirds of the total cost in most cities as against one-third for labor , have been responsible for the decline in total costs since August , 1937 It is particularly significant that accompanying the decline in material and total costs since the fall of 1937 has come a new and rapid rise in the volume of residential construction . one which has carried well above the early 1937 peak . So marked is the relation between costs and volume of construction that it seems certain the following conclusions can be drawn : the sharp rise in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1937 helped choke off an incipient building boom . the decline in material and total costs from the latter part of 1937 to the present time was an important factor in reviving new residential construction , and a complementary decline in labor costs now would give new impetus to home construction . Following table shows swings of the material , labor , and total cost indices during the past three and a half years :
