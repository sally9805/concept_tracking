Every half hour last week a ship 's bell chimed from a loudspeaker through Manhattan 's Grand Central Palace , followed by an announcement such as this : " Four bells . Two o'clock , nautical time . This signal was brought to you by courtesy of the Sea Scouts of America . The bell was struck by Scout Robert Schmidt . " If the bell rang between times everybody in the hall stopped , listened . It meant that another boat had been sold from the floor of the 29th annual Motor Boat Show . <P> The sales bell rang often enough to keep up the general optimism of the 150 exhibitors . Notable absentees of last year , Gar Wood and Chris-Craft , were back in the fold . Sales emphasis had shifted from the glittering high-speed craft of yesterday to compact , comfortable utility runabouts and small cruisers , moderately priced , for family use . <P> A motorboat show differs from an automobile show in that practically all the new developments are invisible to the untrained eye . A five-year-old cruiser could be planted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never know the difference . Radical changes in design from year to year are practically unknown . But there are always new wrinkles . The talk of the 1934 show was rubber mountings for engines , to reduce noise and vibration . First introduced by Chrysler two years ago , it is incorporated in many new models , notably in Elco 's Veedette 28 . Another new twist is Dodge 's " Multiple vee bottom , " a system of overlapped planking which reduces side spray , adds stability and speed . <P> Deep into the low-price field dived Chris-Craft , the company founded by Christopher Columbus Smith and now run by himself , his four sons , three grandsons and two granddaughters . They offered a utility runabout for $495 . Another notable new Chris-Craft is the 24-ft. family cruiser with four berths , stove , ice box and toilet for $1,495 . The minimum in overnight comfort ( two berths ) in a utility cruiser , can be had for $1,295 plus $45 for a toilet . Chris-Craft also has its line of runabouts , ranging up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the show was that of another famed boat-building family , the Wheelers , father and four sons . Months before the show opened Son Wesley Wheeler studied a floor plan of the exhibit hall , calculated that a 54-ft. ship was the biggest that could possibly be squeezed in . At their Brooklyn . N. Y. plant the Wheelers proceeded to build a 54-footer , serenely aware that nobody could steal the show from them . With salty , side-whiskered Father Howard Ernest Wheeler looking on , the big cruiser , a yacht-like affair with flying bridge and twin screws , was warped into place with less than a foot to spare . Crowds stood in line to go aboard and gape at her two staterooms with yellow brocaded bedspreads ; her tiled shower with hot and cold water ; her three toilets , her spacious saloon ; her dining nook ; her galley with gas stove , refrigerator , pantry . Unusual for a ship of that size was the flying bridge , with all controls away from the social quarters . Accommodations : eight plus a crew of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show .
