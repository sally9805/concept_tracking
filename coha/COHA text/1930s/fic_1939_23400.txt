THE SECRET FOE A STORY BY HELEN HULL E WIS HENDRICI climbed the hill to the College . The strong west wind rushed up the tunnel of the street , flapping his spring overcoat , whisking past his head with a tang of abattoirs . The spring sunlight lay thin and without warmth on the wide plaza of steps which led to the college buildings . Lewis noted that the iris spears of green , in spite of the continued cold , had thrust themselves out of the tangled old leaves . A late spring this year . He walked toward his office slowly , moving with resistance to the rush of the wind , setting his feet down like a heavy , elderly man . He was neither old nor heavy , but his tall , spare body had something too like fumbling in its motion . A few hardy young things , boys and girls , perched on the stone benches . Lewis did not glance at them ; they all looked alike ; he had stopped years ago trying to recognize students outside the classroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went more slowly , his reluctance almost a physical barrier . As he had left the apartment Judith , his wife , had called from her bedroom , where she was trying to sleep off a bad headache , " Be sure to telephone when you reach the office . " " There may be no news this morning , " he had said . " But the Trustees had their meeting yesterday ! I 'd call you , but you 're never in the office when I call , at least your secretary tells me that ! " " I wish you would n't count on it so , " he had said . " They 're paring the budget right and left ; what chance have I for a promotion ? " " If you 'd only do something instead of taking that attitude ! " She had n't lifted her head to look at him ; he had closed her door before he gave a weary shrug . Someone burst out of the Psychology Building , strode along the walk , bareheaded , arms swinging . Ridley . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock still , but Ridley saw him , fairly jumped far him , his face keen , hard , triumphant . " Ah , Hendrick ! " He waved a blue envelope in Lewis 's face . " Did you get yours ? Right in the middle of my desk , pretty little flower that blooms in the spring , tra-la ! We take pleasure , at ' , but not so much as I do , my dear President ! " " Congratulations , " said Lewis dryly . He saw the secret malice in Ridley 's eyes . " I have n't seen my mail yet . " Unwillingly he added , " I did n't know you were up . " " Yes , I was . Up and not down . " His diaphragm expanded , he snapped at the envelope . " It was that monograph that did it . Cot me two other offers , you see . Well , hope you have a break too . " He knows damned well I have n't , thought Lewis as he entered the building . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Monographs , offers ! " You 've been here long enough , Hendrick , " the Dean had told him ; " your teaching is valuable . But , to speak frankly , you have n't produced enough . But you 're going up this year , and I 'll see what I can do for you It might have been wiser if you had n't taken on summer school , and that extension course too . You have n't left much leeway . " " Leeway does n't take up the slack in the budget , " said Lewis . Perhaps a family was a luxury no academic man should have . Schools , camps , food , doctors , nurses , servants . Funny , Judith had been so well , so indefatigable , so apparently indestructible , when they married . He tried the handle of the office door and reached for his key . He was glad Frieda Kane , the secretary , had n't come yet . As a matter of fact , he had come early to make sure he could look over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department only three years  --  against the twenty Lewis had given . Most of the twenty Frieda had been the secretary . Not much she did n't know about the inner workings . He had known there would be no blue envelope , but in spite of that he went through the little pile of letters twice , his fingers awkward , his thin face set in its habitual mask of indifference . What he had n't known was that Ridley would be given his promotion . For by rights it belonged to Lewis . Conceited , bombastic young upstart ! Lewis hated him , wearily , without fire . Judith would say shrilly , " They did n't pare the budget when it came to Ridley , did they ? " Lewis opened the letters methodically , reading circulars which advertised new texts on psychology as if he really had some interest in them . He found a note from Parker , adviser in extension : would Professor Hendrick drop in as soon as possible to talk over his son , Gilbert . He heard voices in the hall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and presently Miss Kane opened his door . " Have you any dictation this morning , Professor Hendrick ? " Lewis turned in his chair and looked at her . He was thinking how pretty she had been when she first appeared as secretary . Blonde , some Scandinavian blood , quiet , smooth , slight , competent . Gray shows slowly in fair hair ; he had n't really seen before how streaked with ash her hair had grown . She still wore it in a braid round her small head , and her eyes were as clear and blue as ever , although her soft skin had wrinkles now . And hips spread when a girl sits all day at a typewriter . She knows all about it , he thought , I wo n't have her pity ! " Nothing , " he said . " If I need you I 'll send for you . " She ruffled the pages of the stenographer 's notebook she carried , her generous mouth , usually so firm , curiously pursed . Lewis swung round in his chair , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close the door . He stared at the desk telephone ; the wire coiled round the cord to prevent kinks began to move under his eyes ; it was circumfluent , its coiling a slow , continuous movement . If he picked up the instrument the coiling would reach his throat , it would strangle him , and Judith 's sobbing when he told her would strangle him . She would he angry if he did n't call , but she would be angry anyway . He had a class at ten , and no lecture ready . He jerked open a drawer of the metal filing case and fumbled through the papers . His hands had a queer gray look , the skin tight over long fingers and large knuckles , the triangle of dark hair on the back like pencil-strokes of shading . He should have worked out a new lecture ; the typed sheets showed their age , discolored along the edges . Miss Kane would copy it if he asked , but after hours . She was overworked anyway ; he was supposed to give her nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he had written them they were fair . He should have checked over several new volumes  --  that Gestalt theory . . . Oh , God , what difference did it make ? He had enough to fill the hour , he would read it in his unresonant voice , and his weariness would communicate itself to the bored students . He could n't even teach any more ! He gave the lecture at ten and again at eleven . He was supposed to lunch at the Faculty Club on Tuesday , to give the maid time for the ironing , but he walked straight past the building and down the rocky slope of the little park . The wind was high above him in the branches of the tall trees , and he found a bench against a steep black face of rock . The branches waved under the smoke-dulled blue of the sky , scarcely a sign of swelling buds as yet . Perhaps spring would n't come this year . One way , a bleak way , to end the world . He sat so still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray squirrel , after several sorties , came to sit almost at his feet , his paws folded against his pale soft breast , his hard bright eyes fixed on Lewis , his plume jerking . Lewis moved one foot , and the squirrel streaked away . I wo n't be stared at , said Lewis ; your eyes are like Ridley 's . He was a coward of course , but he did not wish to go home . The end of the day marched toward him ; almost one o'clock now , there was no time to acclimate himself to this new evidence of failure . He should be indurated to failure by now , it was no foreign clime for him ! If he only had a day or two to himself before he had to face Judith . He realized how hard it was for her , that she had placed all her passion of ambition , of pride in his clumsy hands . He thought , as he had thought so often that he no longer needed words for recognition , that if only she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure in it . But not Judith , when she learned after some years of training that her voice was too small a thing for concert work or opera . Years since he had heard her sing . " I ca n't . I 'm out of practice . I have n't the energy . " He had loved her voice , its quality had the essence of the woman , heartbreaking with its pure fire , its passion . And now the boy had disappointed her too . He would be hanging aboutthe apartment , moody , irritable . I ought to see his adviser to-day , he thought . You 'd think he 'd buckle down and work when they agreed to let him back in college if he made a good record this semester . I do n't see what possesses hind " You 're just like your father , " Judith would say , and both he and Gilbert would know she meant it for the worst diatribe she could find . It would be better if I were dead , thought Lewis , and lifted his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really true . She 'd have enough to live on , more than we have now with the annuity , the insurance . It might be better for the boy too , with me off the scene . Sally would miss me . That girl climbing the long flight of steps lightly , as if she felt too alive for any pull of gravity , was at this distance a little like Sally , slim , quick , a kind of gaiety about her movements . But Sally had her own life , job , husband . She would n't ache much with missing her father , she 'd get over it . Sally had courage . Look at the way she 'd stood up to her mother about getting married . Judith had fought with all her weapons , ridicule , reason , migraine , and Sally had taken young Carver down to the Justice of the Peace . Carver may turn out all right , Judith had said ; he 's so young no one can tell , he has no money , he 's certainly queer looking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why waste yourself ? At least wait till he can support you . It ruins a man to have a wife who 's independent . No wife has time for anything except her husband 's career , it 's folly , madness , I wo n't have it ! Sally had come over to the office to tell Lewis what she meant to do . She had graduated from college in June , she had her first job , a small one in the text-book section of a publishing house . Carver had his degree in law ; he was not much more than office boy in a firm on Exchange Street . " You should n't have told me , " said Lewis . " Your mother will not forgive me for knowing . " " Do n't let her guess you know ! " He could even now feel the fine , fragrant smoothness of her young face against his . " You know , Bill agrees with me about having a job . That way , I wo n't run him ragged You see , I am a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The very violence of his protest had been almost a betrayal ; he had jumped to his feet and gone to stand at the window of the office , wishing Sally not to see his face . After a moment she had said lightly : " I just mean she should have been President or something , and then she could lay off us . When you 've been away from home and come back you see more . I adore my Bill , but I wo n't make him my life work . " " Do n't you want children ? " " Sure ! Quite a bunch of them . But later . If I 'm good at my job I can get time off for a baby . Lots of girls I know do . " That had been last fail , and so far Sally had lost none of that gay , almost luminous happiness . Bill was working hard , but he seemed contented too . Lewis counted the months on his fingers . Eight . That was a long time to stay happy ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of him and his morbid thoughts , would she ? But there might be some way , some kind of accident . He was cold . A shiver rippled through his nerves . Someone walking on my grave , he thought wryly , and got to his feet . How peaceful it would be to be forever deaf and blind and sleeping . He 'd walk across to Main Street and have coffee at some drugstore counter . He could n't eat . I have broken the bread of bitterness , I have drunk the wine of defeat . He walked several blocks before he took a side street , to avoid the College and anyone who might know him . He looked at the men and women he passed , his eyes searching and reflective . How did life taste to each of them , he wondered , what did they live by , what was the pattern , what kept each going ? Headlines of afternoon papers on a stand screamed at him of Danzig , Poland , andhe thought , with distaste , what is my private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever the world is , a man dwells within himself . He might enlist , go fight . for Poland . He was too old , he 'd never elude pursuit and capture if he tried that way out . The coffee warmed him , and he turned hack to the routine of the afternoon . At five he let himself again into his office . The hours of work had numbed him , although he had been aware that just outside the margin of his consciousness there lay this heavy despair , like a dismal swamp from which rank mist blew across his every word and thought . He aid his books and papers on the desk and walked to the long window which filled the end of the narrow room . Like a cell , some ten paces from door to window . He had paced it three times and was half way to the window again when he stopped at a light knock . He held his breath , willing whoever knocked to go away , to leave him alone . But the handle turned slowly , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Have n't you gone home yet ? " he asked sharply . She pulled the door shut , and shook her head . " I thought you you might want me ? for something . " Lewis swung on his heel and continued his pacing to the window . " Well , I do n't , " he said . " Not for a thing . " He stared through the dust-filmed glass at the square of lawn in front of the building , hedged with privet . How deep and green it looked ! Men threw themselves from windows , despair pushed them over the sills , the coroner 's verdict was a heart attack , he must have gone to the window for air ; but this window was too near the ground , a pity his office was on the second floor . " Oh , do n't ! Do n't ! " Frieda 's voice was a whisper in the silence . After a moment Lewis faced her . She stood there against the door in her plain dark dress ; she had grown while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth , the little up-ward movement of her hands had an intensity of tenderness ; it lay like light upon her brow . Lewis tried to shape his face into a smile , to find a word to tell her she was absurd , but he could n't . He sat down on the wide ledge of the window , his hands clenched over the wood . " All day I 've been so frightened . It 's ached ? " she touched her breast . " I had to see you . " " Frightened ? Why , Frieda ? " She brushed the tears from her eyes . " You 've done so much for me . If only I could do something for you . I would do anything . Anything ! " She moved forward quietly until she stood beside the desk . " You know , last night I could n't sleep . I wanted to see you , I almost telephoned your house . I thought if I could tell you , perhaps this morning you would n't be so disappointed . Why should it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , I do n't mean to be impertinent . You know how Ridley pushes himself . " " I know . " Lewis looked at her , remembering as one remembers the contents of a book once read , all he knew of her . She had told him about her life , shyly at first , fragments ; she had lingered after he had dictated letters ; she would say , " I do n't know what makes me tell you everything , I do n't usually talk so much . " Lewis would answer , " You need someone to talk to , I should think . " He knew all about her . Spinster daughter , her own life eaten up by her family . Her father had died the year she started in the department . Her mother , never reconciled to life in America , lived with her , kept house for her , was lonely if Frieda so much as took a walk alone . Her brother , married to an extravagant and incompetent wife , borrowed from Frieda ; after all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she had a steady job ; times were bad for a man . Lewis had advised her , he had looked at pictures of her nephews and nieces , he had enjoyed her warm friendliness , her admiration of him . Judith disliked her . MAGAZINE " The little Swede is crazy about you . Office wife . I know how she flatters you and you lap it up . " That had been years ago . Judith never came to the office now . Frieda growing middle-aged no longer stirred her jealousy , she was a familiar piece of office furnishings . Lewis had thought he knew all about Frieda . Equable , dependable . And now " Another year . . " She was breathing quickly , her voice had a richness in its tones . " They 'll put you through next year , I know they will . Especially if you push yourself a little . If you worked on your book . Maybe if you just talked about it ! You 're better than all the rest of them ! " " Frieda , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Hush ! You think I do n't know what 's happened to you ? " There was color in her fair skin , running down her throat to the fold of white at the neck of her dark frock ; her eyes were brilliant through her tears . " Ail these years ! I 've never said a word , I should n't now , but my heart hurts so . " " My dear , my dear , I 'm not worth this . " He had known it , he had helped eat her up , he had rested on her strength , he had accepted her love because it gave him a pleasant half hour . " If I could only do something fur you ! " " You do . " He got to his feet and came to stand near her . Her tenderness , her love for him was quiet and dark and simple , it had peace at its core because it was selfless ; he could take her and become a man again . " I know you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love a different kind of woman . " " I 'm not worth it . " Lewis thought , I could be happy with her , a little . I do n't love her , she knows . We could go away together , she would do even that if I asked her . Her eyes darkened , the color drained from her face , she lifted her hands as if she showed him how her wrists were shackled with the claims of others . " I say too much , " she said . " These things  --  oh , and more ! ? I have said to you so long in dreams that now I have no shame . " " You should have pride , Frieda . Listen . You are n't to worry about me . You understand ? I 'll be all right . " She looked steadily at him ; for a moment Lewis had the extraordinary sense that there were no barriers between them , that his actual inner self stepped out of flesh and blood and bone , that her clear and lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer so afraid . Then she nodded , the late sun striking the fair braided hair to radiance , and with no word at all she went quickly away . Lewis stood where she had left him , while the light grew dull . He could contrive no accident which would deceive Frieda . Curious how her knowledge of his wish for death thrust the wish back into the darkness from which it had risen . Not because she would suffer at such an act , but because the man she saw when she looked at him could not destroy himself . He was n't that man , he knew . He was a figure in her dreams , she had told him that , the symbol of the lovers she had never had , a figure invested with ' manhood , with even a small kind of glory , by her tenderness , her depth of feeling . He knew , as he walked slowly homeward in a twilight quiet , the wind blown out now , that Judith would strip that investiture from him with a phrase . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , if he could make her see . . . If you worked on your book . Frieda had not spoken of the book since  --  when ? A year ago ? Longer ? She has copied the first chapters for him , she had spoken of it to that fellow from the college department of Scribner 's ; he had been interested . God , five years ago ! Lewis had n't opened the drawer where the manuscript and notes lay , he had been careful never to open it . Judith had had some trouble with her eyes that spring  --  he had finished chapter four , he remembered . He had readaloud evening after evening . " There 's no money in another dull book on psychology , " she had said . " Your style is exactly like a caterpillar tank . it 's just an excuse to stick around the office ! " He had n't been sure enough of either style or motive . Yet he 'd started it with real enthusiasm . He wondered  --  probably it would be dated . Or someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more quickly , and his original plan for the book , bits of ideas , came crawling out of the den of his mind , sluggish turtles stirring out of hibernation , thrusting out their pointed heads , balancing on their scaly feet , trundling their spotted shells into the sunlight . I 'd be sticking out my neck too , thought Lewis , if I spoke of getting at the book again . Had n't the reference to it been Frieda 's gentle way of saying the whole thing 's your fault , you 're a mess ? Ah , no , he would n't wrong Frieda ! She really thought he could do it . When he reached the door of the apartment he did not stand and gird himself , he fitted the key clumsily into the lock and entered ; but he moved his body against reluctance which pressed up to meet him almost like material force . He listened to voices from one of the front rooms and then went forward more easily . Sally was here . That always helped . They were in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her old spot , the long bench under the window , from which she could watch the river , sitting as she always did , knees drawn up , toes waving on balanced heels . As a girl in her teens she had sat there , a book on her knees , an apple in her hand . " Hi , Dad ! " She waved at him . " I 'm bumming a free dinner . Bill 's left me , some kind of bull meeting . " Lewis stopped beside the divan and bent to kiss Judith . She turned her face , her gray eyes hard , her cheek dry , a definite odor of malaise about her , composite of unguents and eau de cologne . She had on a plain dark frock with no white fold at the neck ; she had n't bothered to change , she felt too miserable . He remembered how the color had warmed Frieda 's throat . Judith 's throat was firm and round , the structure of her body was fine , well-proportioned , the bones slender and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head , with the high temples , the crest of heavy gray hair flattened now where she had bound her forehead all day with ice-water . But her face had strokes of deep lines , the delicate modelling of the eye-sockets had changed , the eyes were sunken , the lids dark ; it was a face too worn by her intensities and illnesses . For several years she had scarcely left the house in spite of her former delight in dinners , first nights at the theater ( which they had just begun to afford ) , Sunday concerts ; in spite too of the brilliant charm with which she responded to social stimulus . She could n't accept invitations , she said , when she did n't know at what moment one of these mysterious and terrible headaches would stretch her on the rack . Lewis thought , with dry irrelevance , as he went on to the window and seated himself beside Sally 's feet , that if only his own hair had gone gray when Judith 's did , she would have had one less grievance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time she had looked a dozen years older . Not now ; he knew he moved like an old man . Sally dug her feet against his thigh . " You look sorta seedy , you had a hard day ? " He could see her face now , instead of just the outline of her head against the evening sky . She 'd been having a set-to with her mother ; he knew the signs , high color , mouth drawn in at the corners , short , light-brown hair rumpled where she had run distracted fingers through it . " You must have been busy , " said Judith , " when you had n't time to call me . " " I was , " said Lewis , and Sally tapped a toe against him . " Have you seen Gilbert ? " Judith pushed herself upright , one fine , thin hand against her forehead . " No , I never see him . Is n't he home ? " " Did you call his adviser ? " " I forgot it . I will to-morrow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrating your promotion . " Judith curled her hand into a fist , her eyes , dark-circled , accused him . " Oh , I knew you would n't get it ! I knew ! " " Maybe that 's why I did n't , " Lewis cried out , and stared at her , his nostrils flaring . Sally dropped her feet to the floor , sitting erect beside him . " You mean it is my fault ? " " I do n't mean anything . " What did he mean ? What was this malice , this triumph , that streaked against his dark despair , sudden and jagged as lightning , a delight that out of his impotence came a perverse power , a power to hurt her with further failure ? Sally touched his hand lightly , and said , " If you 're going to fight , make it a good one ! Do n't mind me . " She made a face at him , crinkling her nose , and Lewis shrugged . " I 'm sorry , " he said . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Wait till your health is gone , your hope is gone , your son . . " She dropped back on the divan , hiding her face against her arm . " Good grief , Mother , Dad 's still got a good job . Gilbert 's just a silly kid . " Sally fished in the pocket of her gray jacket , pulled a cigarette from a limp package , lighted it . Lewis thought : she is n't really hard , but she 's escaped her mother , she slides away from her . Judith knows it . " You 've got your headache blues , that 's all . " She rolled an eye at her father : buck up , come on , be a help . " Anyway , I want to tell Dad about Bill and see what he thinks . " Lewis rose and went to the divan , stooping to pick up the Paisley shawl which had fallen to the floor . He spread it over Judith , tucking an edge under her body , his hand lingering a moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure and intense it floated from the soft fabric . " Do n't feel so bad , Judy , " he said humbly . " Another year . . . " Her arm dropped , and her somber eyes held his , but her tense body relaxed under his touch . Then he seated himself in a wing chair , across the room from the window . Unconsciously he had broken the alliance between himself and Sally as part of his petition to Judith . " What about Bill ? " he asked . Sally told her story gaily . Bill had had an offer , a regular job , routine work , handling claims for an insurance COMpany , accidents . Pretty fair salary . He 'd take it if she said so . In Buffalo . " Mother thinks I 'm not seeing straight because I like my job here . It 's enough for Bill to support me , not in elegance , but so-so . We could even afford a baby . " Sally was frowning now , intent . " What 's the out ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe and sure . I do n't believe I 'm thinking just about myself , but it 's hard to know . Dull work , Bill would n't grow . He 's doing well here , he 's learning just heaps ! " In the dining room the maid moved about the table , setting silver and glass in place . Lewis watched her idly . Sally 's words were the tinkle of distant water ; he was thinking of a decision he had made  --  or had Judith made it ? ? twenty years ago . Safe and sure . He 'd had a chance to go abroad , a fellowship , to work on abnormal psychology in Vienna , he 'd just been appointed instructor at the college . Sally was a baby , Gilbert was n't born . He had stayed right here . " Do n't you see . . " He listened to Judith 's voice  --  it might have been twenty years ago , the words of the song had n't altered . " Bill has no certainty about his future in this firm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't grow , as you put it , until you let him have the responsibility of your whole life ! He 's still too much in love with you to ask you to give up your precious job , and you arc very self-centered . " " But he would n't consider it for a split second if it were n't for me ! If he took it it would be because I was afraid he could n't make good by himself ! And I know he can , he 's pretty damned , won-derful , my Bill ! " Her young face had flushed , her eyes found Lewis 's . She was tainted for the moment with doubt of herself , she needed help . " If Bill does n't want it , where 's any argument ? " asked Lewis slowly . Judith made an impatient gesture , her white hands flashing , but Sally jumped to her feet . " I 'll tell Bill just that ! He can make up his own mind by himself . I must clean up a bit for dinner . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , last night Bill wanted to read me a paper he 'd been writing . All statistics and everything . What do you think ? I fell sound asleep ! When I woke up I was paralyzed . I was so scared he 'd think I did n't care . Bill sat there , looking at me . Do you know what he said ? He said , ' I knew it was too dull , I been figuring out a way to make it better . ' " Sally hugged herself , glowing . " That 's Bill ! " Lewis wanted to follow her down the hall . He hoped the maid would n't go off to the kitchen . He had no reason for doing anything except to sit right there , while the silence in the room tightened round him turn by turn . He could see the top of Judith 's head , his fingers knew the texture of the heavy , crisp gray hair . He could sec one hand , trailing toward the floor , the fingers pinning folds in the shawl so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Judith at the room , seeing it as a stranger might . Not shabby exactly , but neglected , no longer informed by the eagerness , the concern of anyone for a home , a shelter . Like a garment hanging forgotten in a closet , keeping some shape with which the one who once wore it had imbued it , but forgotten . When Judith had selected this apartment he could n't afford the rental . That year he began the work in summer school . Such a good address , Judith had said . We can entertain , later Sally will need a decent place for her friends . He remembered the zest , those long years ago , with which Judith had chosen draperies and rugs , making a setting for the fine old pieces of mahogany and pine and maple from her family . Now it was all too like her piano in the corner , closed , unused , no luster in the flat , harp-shaped top , its strings untuned . Sally must have brought in that bunch of daffodils . The colored maid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the whites of her eyes flashing as she peered toward Judith . Judith 's hand dragged the shawl up to her knee and , without turning , she said , " I suppose Ridley got it . " Lewis swallowed ; at least he knew now where she struck . " He did . " Her hand dropped toward the floor again , inert , nothing left to hold . Before the silence choked him the doorbell rang . " I 'll answer , " called Sally , and then , " Why , hello , my little prodigal brother , welcome home ! " " Well , look who 's here ! " came Gilbert 's drawl , nasal , taunting . " Come home to Mother ? Bill could n't stand another minute of you ? " Sally giggled . " No , I could n't live without seeing you , darling little Bertie . " " Yeuh ? Listen , Sal , is Dad home ? " Then , so low Lewis just caught it , " Did he say anything about me ? " " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Cripes , do you have to jump me too , suspecting me . . . " " Do n't scream , Mother 's got a headache . " " Oh , I suppose so . " Gilbert thumped into his room and banged the door . Judith lifted herself on an elbow , just enough to turn her face toward Lewis , the cords of her throat taut . " I knew something was wrong . The way he acted this morning . He thanks you know what it is . Why did n't Parker tell you ? Is n't that supposed to be his work ? " " I did have a note from him . " Lewis moved his hands uneasily . " It did n't sound urgent . I  --  I 've had sort of a bad day . " " Too have ? " Judith sank backward , her hand flung palm outward , a symbol of her rejection of him , his day , his excuses . " At least ? " her voice was thin , diluted , as if she had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to-night . I ca n't . I ca n't endure another thing . " The despair of the morning enclosed him again , even the faint echo of Frieda 's warm , rich words sounded from a distant mountain , high above this darkness , almost from a different life . I ca n't endure another thing , his mind mocked Judith . Sally came to the doorway , her glance quick , inquiring . " Maudie says dinner is ready . " Lewis rose , looking down at Judith . Her eyes were closed , blind , sealed with the umber shadow of the lids . " Dinner , Judy ? " " I do n't wish any dinner . " " We 'll fix you something nice . " Sally took her father 's arm and led him briskly into the dining room . " Call Gilbert , Maudie , " she said . " And bring a tray for Mother ; we 'll arrange it . " Gilbert came , a shaggy , overgrown boy with a sullen , immature face , a boy 's face above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He disappeared into the living room , but Lewis did not hear the words in Judith 's vibrant murmur . When Gilbert scuffed into the dining room , his ears red , he answered his father 's good-evening with a mumble and slid into his chair . Sally chattered about her work ; she 'd been asked to write out reports on some of the manuscripts for the chief editor , she was pretty proud of that . Some day she 'd get to be an editor herself . Maudie served the dinner with languid indifference ; she had cooked it in the same way . She was one of a procession of spindle-legged , sleeked-headed colored girls who moved through the Hendrick kitchen , departing at night laden with mysterious bundles . " She 's worse than the last one , " said Sally , poking at the disheartened vegetables , the overdone beef . " I 'd better poach an egg for Mother . " " I ca n't afford to pay any more , " said Lewis . " Your mother 's  --  well , they take advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tries to whip one of them into shape , the girl gets mad and walks out . " " I remember , we never did keep a girl long , but by golly , they were stepping lively while they lasted , " Sally smiled . " Bill and I do n't have anybody now ; we bought a vacuum on the installment plan , and we clean house Sunday morning . Bill 's getting good . " " Making a sissy of him , " mumbled Gilbert . " When I get a wife , she 's gon na do the housework . " " And everything else too , I guess , " said Sally , sharply . " At the rate you 're going ! " Gilbert glowered at her and drank a second glass of milk . He ate stolidly through second helpings of everything . " What you been doing to-day ? " asked Lewis . I 've got to tackle him , he thought , he 's got every bristle up , he probably wo n't talk- " Aw , nothing much , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under sandy lashes . " I was in the library a long time . " " I 'll fix the tray for Mother . You got a fresh egg , Maudie ? " Sally followed the maid out to the kitchen , and Lewis pushed back his chair . He had tried to eat  --  perhaps his fatigue was in part hunger  --  but the odor of food dried his throat and he could scarcely swallow . The coffee , bitter as gall , had cleared his head . He might wake in the night with the knife of indigestion at his vitals , but he could n't eat now . Gilbert rose with alacrity . " I promised some of the fellows I 'd be around , " he said , lowering his voice . " We 're going to work at those trig problems . " " Wait a minute . " Lewis 's voice caught him at the door . " Come along to the study , I want to see you . " Gilbert did a brief contortion , his long , loose body expressing in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he subsided , and with his father crossed the hall to the small room which Lewis called his study . Lewis shut the door , the desk lamp threw shadows over the book-lined walls , the boy lingered at the door . " Have a chair , " said Lewis , sitting in the armchair beside the desk . " I really have this date , Dad . " " One with me first . " Here is another of my failures , thought Lewis . We are strangers , my son looks at me with hostility out of cycs like mine , he wishes only to elude rne . I talk to him on such occasions as this . " Shoot then , " said Gilbert . " Get it over . " Then , in a voice suddenly hoarse , " I suppose ole Parker 's been crabbing about me again ; it 's worse'n any Nazis , picking on me , you all pick on me . . . " His voice broke , he hu rdled the room and muffled his head in the folds of chintz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son 's shoulders , agitated , at the faded pattern of flowers which jumped round his bent head . What was Gilbert saying ? Lewis leaned forward , the palms of his hands prickling . " I tell you I wish I was dead ! Leave me alone ! I wish " " Gilbert ! You need n't tear the curtain down . Brace up ! Turn round here . You have n't committed a murder , have you ? " He spoke dryly , curtly , his authority puncturing the swollen emotion . " Sit down here , let 's have it . What 's up ? " It ca n't be girl trouble , he thought ; the boy 's afraid of girls . Gilbert straightened his shoulders , he removed his face from the curtains , and in a lower , strangled voice , said , " I know I 'm a punk , I 'm no good , I get sick of hearing it , I do n't care what I do , I hate it . " He turned , his eyelids flushed , his mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought I 'd ask you what he wanted . " Gilbert sat on a straight chair , his hands dangled between his knees . " You know all right . " " Have you flunked out again ? " " I do n't know . " " You must know . " Gilbert screwed his face into a belligerent scowl , one eyelid jerked . " You 've been cutting again ? " Lewis did n't like that jerking , it was almost a tic . " I could n't pass the mid-terms , I was n't going back to their lousy classes . Go on , tell me I 'm a disgrace , my father 's a professor , I ca n't make the grade . I tell you I wish I was dead . I knew a fellow last year , and he ran away , to Spain . But I do n't know how to get on a boat . " Lewis felt a dreadful catabolism begin within him , as if the very cells of his body were split . This adolescent despair in his son 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image of himself , to the very words ! He said quietly , " I have never called you a disgrace . I do n't understand what you 're trying to do . Gould you help me out a little ? I do n't like to see you ruining all your chances . " ( You arc too young to know the taste of failure , why should you destroy yourself ? ) " Just what do you do all day , when you do n't go to the lousy classes ? " His tone was so gentle , so deeply charged with a need to understand , that Gilbert lifted his head a trifle , staring at his father . " I start out to go , " he said , slowly . " Honest , I do . And then then I ca n't get there . I read . I go sit in a movie . Sometimes I play pool with the fellows if I have any money . " " The odd thing is you 're smart enough to do the work with your eyes shut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lewis leaned back in his chair , his mind was suddenly keen and strong , hovering like a hawk on wings spread and unmoving , a fish-hawk , high enough above the surface of the boy 's life , the known surface , to detect through the dark water a flash of silver , the living clue . " All right . Why , you were only fifteen when you graduated , with honors . So young your mother did n't wish you to go away from home to college . " His mind swooped downward , talons closing over the struggling , living , silver clue . " If she 'd let me alone , " said Gilbert , in a hoarse , shamed whisper . " She watches me so I ca n't breathe right ! " He twisted in his chair , hiding his face under an upflung arm . " I do n't want to be like this ! " Lewis got to his feet stiffly and went past the boy to the window . Pushing back the curtains , he looked out and down . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glimpse of the river . Cars moved below him , their tops reflecting the lights of the drive . Down the river moved a boat , a tug , probably , towing barges , its lights like a constellation fallen to the surface of the water , drifting down to the lower bay . Haze concealed the real stars . Looking down , he heard again Frieda 's voice , her whisper , " Do n't ! Oh , do n't ! " He thought , he took Him unto a high place , and showed Him  --  not the kingdoms of the world , but peace , escape  --  said , all these will I give Thee .. . I can not have it , he thought , but Gilbert must . Now that at last I begin to comprehend . Gilbert had never been as strong as Sally . As a little boy he had had all the childish diseases , he had grown too fast , he was nervous , always his mother 's boy . Lewis had tried to show her that her solicitude harmed the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped from a rock , he had had pneumonia . Lewis had insisted that the boy be sent to camp ; he had tried twice to run away , being homesick , and then had fallen from a horse , breaking his leg . After that , Lewis let Judith decide the boy 's fate . But Gilbert himself had wished to go away to college ; he had picked the place , a Middle-Western university . He could see the curious uncertainty in the boy 's face when Judith had said , " Darling ! You do n't want to go so far away ! Not yet , you 're just a little boy , you are n't strong enough , you Her white fingers knew how to pluck at the strings of his heart ; in her unhappiness had she wrenched them until they snapped ? For the boy had changed , growing secretive , sullen . Judith had been incredulous at the reports of his failure , then she had used the tactics she had perfected with Lewis , satire , caustic comment , bitter entreaty . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life to help you ! " Recently she had added , " You 're just like your father ! " Lewis tingled with shock ; this was a moment of revelation which he might not keep . He must act quickly while his eyes were clear . Something heady about it , something tonic , giving him an illusion of strength , lifting him above habits of restraint , above the habit of dreading consequences . Judith knew the boy was struggling to free himself . She would destroy him , not seeing what she did , rather than let him go ! He rested his forehead against the glass ; it was cool and smooth , and then it seemed to ring with the beat of blood in his temples . Poor Judith , she was dying of her thwarted strength . She has tried to live in us , he thought , having no other way to satisfy her boundless desires for power , for fame , for achievement . Gilbert had chosen the weapon of a weakling ; if , conforming to his mother 's plan for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I too ! Lewis pushed himself away from the window . Secretly he had blamed Judith . It had taken him a long time to look at the truth , that a man 's hardihood might be nourished  --  or not from without , but its roots should go down deep into the soil of his own being . In the silent room the little scuff of the boy 's feet as he shifted in his chair was loud and bewildered . Frieda knows this , thought Lewis ; without her I should never have seen it . He turned to the boy . " You need to get away , " he said . " That 's what ails you . You 're growing up , and that hurts . Mixes you all up . I do n't know ... I should think you 'd want an education . You ca n't do much without one . Would you tackle work at some other school ? I think I could get you in in spite of all this . " Gilbert lifted his head , his face creased from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale . " She would n't let you , " he said . " She  --  when I wanted to go . . ? What if I went away and she died ? " " Listen to me . " Lewis stood near the boy , his hand pressed hard against the round bones , the undeveloped muscles of the shoulder . " She 'd like it if you were making good , would n't she ? You know , this morning I felt pretty much the way you do . I thought I 'd pull up stakes . " He saw in his son 's eyes a flicker of maturity , an admission that he had more knowledge of his father than he could yet use . " But I 'm staying on condition that you get out . No one can stop you . It 's April now . " He withdrew his hand , plunging it into a pocket . " Some of the engineering boys are going to Chicago in May , to spend the summer in the steel mills there . You want to be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have you got the guts to go ? I can get you in . You wo n't earn much , it 's hot as hell and dirty . Then in the fall you can enter the university . As a freshman , mind you . " Gilbert stumbled up to his feet . His eyes were on a level with Lewis 's . He thrust out his chin , the line of jaw hardening . " Can you fix it ? " he asked . " Yes , " said Lewis . " I can fix it . " " Okay . " Gilbert 's face moved , the eyelid twitching , his mouth opened , his throat gulped twice before he added , " I wo n't let you down . " Then he lunged across the room , jerked at the door , and clattered down the hall , as if he ran with a bomb which must be rushed outdoors before exploding . Lewis heard Judith call , " Gilbert ? Where are you going ? Gil-bert ! " and heard the outer door slam shut . Need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wait until he had the boy 's summer arranged . All , he was dodging again ! He would tell her tonight . But first . . . He sat down at his desk , searching among the papers in the top drawer for a key . This he fitted into the lock of the deep drawer at his left . He had to tug before the drawer came open , disclosing the dull red of manila folders . If you push yourself , Frieda had said . If you would work on your book . He lifted one of the folders to the desk and spread his hands over it , flat . It might not be as obsolete as he had thought . Sally spoke from the doorway . " I 've got to run along , Dad . " He rose , stepping toward her , and she took both his hands , swinging them gently . " It 's nice to come home . You look as if your bedtime talk had been a great success . " " It was a good one . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come home now you do n't have to stay . " Her hands stopped abruptly . " It 's all right , Sally . What I mean , it 's time Gilbert got away too . Is n't it ? " Sally nodded . " That 's all . Good-night . Give Bill my best . " " Could I help ? " " No . It 's my job . " Sally nodded toward the living room . " Mother feels better , I think . She ate the egg . She was quite cheerful about Gilbert ; she says he 's just too young for college yet . She said if you were n't busy ? " " Okay , " said Lewis , smiling at his daughter . We drink of any strength we find , he thought , liking the way she carried her slim figure as she called a final good-night to Judith and went lightly down the hall . The house was empty now except for him and Judith . He walked into the living room , his face compassionate and stern , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARY N. S.
