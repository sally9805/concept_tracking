DEEP SOUNDINGS-Alan Cor by-C axton ( $2.50 ) . <P> Alan Corby is the closely-guarded pseudonym of a famed U. S. adventure writer . Whether he took an alias because he was afraid Deep Soundings would queer him with his usual Boy Scout audience , or because he wanted it to make its own way as a serious literary work , is hard to say . On the literary side the book is a straight throwback to Kipling and Jack London- a story involving the hazards of convoying merchant ships during the War , with a hero who , through duty and red-hot blood rather than patriotism , faces death as manfully as love . Added to this familiar pattern are modern touches of swearing , sex and disillusionment . As a result Deep Soundings plays hob with the tradition which demands that adventure fiction , no matter how tough its heroes , must preserve a cleanliness seldom found elsewhere in life or literature . As an example of the one serious book which every adventure writer intends to write some day , Deep Soundings is mainly interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eden , it got published . <P> Rex Dean , young petty officer on the cruiser Baton Rouge , was a Texas-born , square-faced , blue-eyed , accomplished sailor who liked " rough weather and lots of hell . " In quieter moments he wrote for adventure magazines , read everything from Kipling to Marcus Aurelius . Coming into Bremerton Navy Yard on April 6 , 1917 , having known since the Baton Rouge left Mexico that war was not far off , Rex had already got himself straight about his own part in it . Uncle Sam was " Uncle Sucker . " From now on you only pretended the Allies were in the right , and killed and got killed automatically ; forgot that in foreign bars U. S. sailors always fought on the German side . By the time the Baton Rouge was put in shape for war service Rex had conquered an aloof Bremerton blonde . But when , after their secret outing in Seattle , she begged him to apply for a soft Navy office job , the most Rex would concede was to marry her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or she would fall for somebody else before long . <P> Enroute to New York , trying to make sailors out of a green crew of " gum boots , " Rex concluded that the Navy was on the skids and that " the country 'll be flooded with malted milk within ten years . " On shore leave at Norfolk , thanks to the new prestige of fighting men , he spent the night with a " lovely little savage " at the home of Virginia socialites . While the Baton Rouge waited off Staten Island for a convoy of 16 freighters to be assembled , a hard-drinking pulpwood editor enabled Rex to find out about life in Greenwich Village .
