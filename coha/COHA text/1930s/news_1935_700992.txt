txt Following the round-up by Federal agents of his so-called tri-State gang , Robert Mais , fugitive murderer and Public Enemy 1 of the **30;0;TOOLONG region , confessed here yesterday that he had plotted a series of kidnappings . Simon S. Neuman , wealthy distiller of Bryn Mawr , Pa. , had been selected as the first victim , Mais said . Mr. Neuman , president of the Continental Distilling Company and of the Publicker Commercial Alcolhol Company , was to have been abducted near his home and held for $50,000 ransom , according to the confession . Precautions taken by the distiller , as the result of other kidnappings , caused the plan to fail just as the gang had posted men near the Neuman garage to wait for an opportunity to seize the intended victim , officials said . Subsequently , according to the confession , the gang turned to a plan to abduct Sam Lazar , who had been described In a grand jury investigation in 1928 as one of the leaders of the alcohol racket on Philadelphia . Increasing pressure on the gang by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flee to New York , MI. estigators believed , and made yesterday 's round-up possible . Betrayed , unwittingly , by the blonde " girl friend " of Mais , the gang was taken into custody in a series of arrests by Federal agents . The arrests were noteworthy in that not a single shot was fired in contrast to recent clashes between underworld groups and the Department of Justice . Mais 's confession was obtained , it was learned , In conversations with agents after his arrest . Points other than the admissions concerning crimes the gang did not commit were kept secret , however , pending further inquiry . Philadelphia police , it was reported , were informed of the confession and were active in the general investigation of the activities of the gang . Mr. Neuman , according to dispatches , also was informed of the plot against him , but declined to comment on the precautions he had taken . His estate was said to be under guard by private detectives . The Federal haul , in which police of New York and Philadelphia cooperated , netted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second in command ; Edwin Gale , Martin Farrell , and the woman , described only as Marie . All were held in close custody last night , after having been arrested ( before daylight at various ad'dresses , pending a decision on their return to one or the other of the States where the band was most active ? Pennsylvania , Maryland and Virginia . Francis X. Fay , in charge of the Department of Justice Bureau of Investigation at 370 Lexington Avenue , declared that the arrests had been preceded by several weeks of investigation . " We have the entire gang , " he said , and explained the part played by the woman as an unknowing ally of the forces of justice . Shot Way Out of Prison . Mais , who is 29 years old , and Lagenza , who is 41 , had been sought since September , when they shot their way out of prison at Richmond , Va. , Mr. Fay pointed out . Their escape , in which they killed one prison guard and wounded two others , occurred while they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custodian of a mail truck . Investigation later indicated that the revolvers used had been smuggled to the prisoners in cans labeled " roast chicken , " and the woman , Mr. Fay said , 1 came under suspicion as the sender of the weapons . She was accordingly placed under observation . A few days ago she came to New York , Mr. Fay said , without going into details of his investigation . Unknown to her , Federal agents followed her . By observing her movements , the investigators learned the hiding places of the gang . Gale and Farrell were arrested first , at a midtown hotel . The agents , aided by detectives under the command of Acting Lieutenant Walter Sullivan of the New York department and Captain James Malone of Philadelphia , simply " picked them up " there , making the arrests so quickly that neither suspect had time to offer resistance , if he had been so minded . " In fact , there was no trouble In any of the arrests , " other than the usual scuffling , " Mr. Fay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they were in custody before they knew what had happened . " Lagenza Seized In Hospital . Lagenza was arrested next , at the Presbyterian Hospital , where he was receiving treatment for two broken legs , believed to have been received recently when he jumped from a high embankment to escape Philadelphia police at a suburb of that city . The woman , her usefulness to the agents ended , was taken into custody at the hospital also , when she made one of her periodical visits at Lagenza . As far as investigators could learn , no crimes had been committed by the gang in New York . They attributed this to fear on the gang 's part that the investigation was too close to them , so that its members hesitated to assemble , and to Lagenza 's injuries . He was brought to the hospital on Dec. 17 , four days after this escape , by a man and a woman who said that he had received his injuries in a fall downstairs while drunk . He was known at the hospital under the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ augmented forces , the agents and detectives went to the known hide-out of Mais , an apartment at 8 Manhattan Avenue . Men were posted to block all exits and a raiding party entered , breaking into the bedroom where Mais was sleeping . The gang leader , known for two characteristics , his unnaturally squeaky voice and his readiness to kill persons who obstructed his criminal enterprises , did not have time to reach for the loaded revolver near his pillow . Agents leaped upon him , handcuffed him while he was still in bed , and lifted the revolver from his reach . Searchfurther , they found a dirk within reach also . Mais , once he was aroused and could realize his helplessness , * offered no resistance , Mr. Fay said . All were turned over to the police for safekeeping , an I the office of the Bureau of Investigation said later that the place of detention would not be made known for the present . It was not decided whether the prisoners would be arraigned before a United State Commissioner , but it was announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charges concerning which the investigators have gathered evidence . Mr. Fay declared that the investigators were " morally certain " that the gang , known variously as the Mais gang or the Tri-State gang , because of the scope of its operations , had been implicated in the kidnapping of Williattb Weiss , a figure in the night life of Philadelphia , last November . His relatives and friends paid a ransom of $8,000 or more after $100,000 had been demanded by the abductors . Weiss was not returned , however , and is I believed by the police to have been murdered . Other crimes in Philadelphia that have been investigated as work of the gang include a $4,000 hold-up at a branch office of the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company in October , and a $48,500 payroll hold-up at the office of the Philadelphia Electric Company in December . In addition , Mais and Lagenza were accused , after their escape from prison at Richmond , of robbing a government arsenal at Norristown , Pa. , to obtain weapons , including automatic rifles , and of similarly looting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June . Should no other charges be placed against the men members of the gang , all could be held as fugitives from justice , Federal agents said . In this case , it was said , the charges against Mais and Lagenza would be based on their escape at Richmond . Farrell who is 28 , was said to have escaped from Eastern penitentiary , in Pennsylvania last Summer , and Gale , who is 23 , was described as a fugitive from a Georgia chain gang .
