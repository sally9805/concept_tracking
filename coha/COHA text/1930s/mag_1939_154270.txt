Some products sell particularly well in depressions : neckties-because they are a cheaper way of sprucing up than new suits of clothes ; cans-because canned food is generally cheaper than fresh . From an announcement last week by the New York Coffee &; Sugar Exchange , it appears that coffee may also belong in this special group . As it has in several depression years since 1929 , U. S. coffee consumption last year set a new high . The 1938 figure was 14.38 lbs . per person , up 1.34 lb. since 1937 . <P> There are other explanations-that Prohibition gave coffee drinking a big boost , that high-pressure advertising plus cheap retail prices has put it over , that the nervous national tempo leads to excessive use of all stimulants . But it also may be that when depression nips an average man 's buying power , he finds a 5 cup of coffee a sort of emotional ersatz for more expensive things . <P> That the U. S. became a nation of coffee-swizzlers was no more accident than Great Britain 's taking to tea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1857 from China . In the interval , England 's great East India Company let Dutch and French exporters grab most of the coffee trade . So British patriots turned to tea . Later , the East India Company tried to force its monopoly on the American Colonies under the notorious Tea Act . So American patriots held the Boston Tea Party and turned to coffee . <P> Today hot coffee is served in 96.4% of U. S. homes , hot tea in 87.5% , but the quantity of coffee drunk is far greater . While the U. S. has contrived no coffee ceremony to parallel the Japanese tea ceremony , it has paid coffee a typical American tribute : in Massachusetts in 1865 the percolator was invented . And nowadays a cornerstone of economic solidarity between the 21 American republics is the annual purchase of 13,000,000 bags of coffee-mostly the lower-priced coffees of Brazil , partly the quality coffees of Colombia , which are frequently used , as Turkish tobacco is used in cigarets , for blending purposes .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
