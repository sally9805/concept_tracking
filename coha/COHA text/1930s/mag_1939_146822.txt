This year at Forest Hills , with Don Budge a pro , the seeded list for the national lawn tennis singles had mostly sophomores instead of Titans-listless Davis Cuppers Bobby Riggs and Frank Parker ; Joe Hunt , Jack Kramer , Don Mc-Neill , Gil Hunt , Elwood Cooke . The foreign seedings might as well have stopped with Australians Jack Bromwich and Adrian Quist . <P> In the upper brackets Riggs had a cinch . He chopped off Australian Journalist Harry Hopman after Harry had eliminated troublesome Bitsy Grant . He waded through Joe Hunt , after Joe had spent two days ( the match was interrupted by darkness ) and five endless sets whittling down French Champion Don Mc-Neill . <P> In the lower bracket , the form favorite was Bromwich , the two-hander who plays tennis like a man batting out fungoes . In the quarter-final he easily dismissed Gil Hunt , the Washington , D. C. mathematician who sometimes uses a tennis court to demonstrate how he can balance a pencil on his bare toes . But in Jack 's next match , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19-year-old , six-foot-one Golden Boy from California , unseeded and unsung , but the nearest thing to full Titan stature U. S. tennis has seen this season . Sidney Welby Van Horn , who prefers Welby because he thinks Sidney sounds like Percy , showed an overhead game like Budge 's , a forehand like Vines 's , a backhand like nobody 's and a service like sixty to nudge the tired veteran Bromwich ( a year his senior ) out of the tournament . <P> As it turned out , he was merely clearing a troublesome opponent out of Riggs 's way . Duckwalking Bobby had little to do late in the week but watch Welby wallop stylists like Elwood Cooke and Wayne Sabin ( who beat Quist ) . When the final round came Sunday afternoon , 21-year-old Bobby knew how to handle Welby . Bobby kept him moving , fed him no setup lobs , passed him at the net , caught him flustered and flatfooted with service aces , finished him off in straight sets , 6-4 , 6-2 , 6-4 . Bobby won the title , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Welby . " Next year , " they said . In the women 's singles , Alice Marble breezed through with scarcely a challenge , stood off a grim Helen Jacobs in the final , to the enjoyment of practically everybody but leathery oldster Molla Mallory , who said Alice would never be a tennis player until she learns to put some spin on her forehand.
