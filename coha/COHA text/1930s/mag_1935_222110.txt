To the world at large a quarter century ago the name of Herbert Clark Hoover meant exactly nothing . But Californians , particularly Stanford alumni , were already proud of Engineer Hoover 's success and , regarding him as their most distinguished Londoner , usually carried letters of introduction when they crossed the Atlantic . Hence it was inevitable that when Benjamin Shannon Allen , a scholarly young reporter with an A. B. and A. M. in history from Stanford , was assigned to Associated Press 's London bureau in 1910 , he should soon make his way to the Hoovers ' " Red House . " For four years the friendship of the two expatriates ripened in private . Then came the War and the beginning of the astute and spectacular publicity build-up which ended by making Herbert Hoover a World Name and 31st President of the U. S. The publicity artist who sketched the solid outlines of the Hoover portrait which the world came to know was Ben S. Allen . <P> After he had consented to feed starving Belgium , Mr. Hoover borrowed Newsman Allen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially in the U. S. , was promptly flooded with news of the prodigious feats of organization , diplomacy and greathearted endurance by which a modest U. S. engineer was keeping an entire nation alive . When Mr. Hoover went home to be U. S. Food Administrator , Ben Allen went with him . Their joint efforts added a new word , " Hooverize , " to the national vocabulary , made Mr. Hoover and his food edicts an intimate part of the daily life of every man , woman &; child in the land . By 1920 Mr. Hoover bulked large enough in the public mind to be discussed seriously for the Presidency despite the fact that he could not make up his mind whether he was a Democrat or a Republican . <P> Ben Allen did not share in his hero 's glory as Secretary of Commerce or in the greater glory yet to come . What happened to the Hoover-Allen association has long been a subject of speculation among political observers . There were rumors of a blowup , a serious breach . These stories are now hotly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only resentment he ever displayed in the years of separation was against those who he felt had shouldered him out of his place at Mr. Hoover 's writing elbow . Ben Allen declares that he returned to California after the War simply because he and his wife longed for home . Mr. Hoover 's money helped start him off as owner of the Sacramento Union . Later he worked as a farm journal editor , finally as a free-lance publicity man . <P> Meantime Secretary of Commerce Hoover was handling his own press relations with surprising skill . A picked group of Washington correspondents , headed by Jay Hayden of the Detroit News and Roy Roberts of the Kansas City Star , went regularly to the Hoover office to be treated to encyclopedic and immensely helpful disquisitions on current national and international problems . Their mentor 's name did not appear in the resulting dispatches , but the grateful newsmen saw to it that the Secretary of Commerce 's light was not hidden under a bushel.               @ @ @ @ @ @
