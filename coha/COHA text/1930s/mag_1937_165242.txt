Bat for Nye Sirs : <P> With reference to Mr. Warren Terry 's letter ( TIME , March 15 ) , may I not come to bat for Senator Nye despite the fact that he has chosen to endorse a cigaret ? <P> Doubtless it is poor policy for any public official to so use his name , but perhaps others ' indignation will be quelled , as was mine , when learning the motive behind the acceptance of money for testimonials . While I do n't pretend to know what all the Senators did with their checks , I do know that Senator Nye endorsed his $1,000-check and gave it to local charity THREE WEEKS PRIOR TO THE APPEARANCE OF THE ADVERTISEMENT wherein he gave his opinion ( ? ) of Lucky Strikes . I do n't remember the exact organization he favored , but it was either a crippled children 's home or an orphanage in eastern North Dakota . <P> Do n't you think Senator Nye 's action commendable and worthy of more publicity than State newspapers can offer ? <P> LUTHER L. MOTT Bismarck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nye by Lord &; Thomas advertising agency for his endorsement of Lucky Strikes was made payable to the Good Samaritan Home for Crippled Children , Fargo , N. Dak. - ED . <P> Bridges and Luckies Sirs : <P> In your issue of March 15 , on p. 4 , there is an Editor 's note stating that " New Hampshire 's Bridges " was among the Senators who had endorsed Lucky Strike Cigarettes . <P> If you will ascertain the facts you will find that Senator Bridges has not endorsed Lucky Strike Cigarettes nor does he intend to endorse Lucky Strike Cigarettes or any other brand . <P> A statement to that effect in an early issue will be only fair . <P> F. V. CARTLEDGE Secretary to H. Styles Bridges United States Senate Washington , D. C. <P> New Hampshire 's Bridges , like Nebraska 's Burke , received a check for his endorsement , but later exercised his privilege to withdraw from the arrangement. - ED . <P> Alabama Boys Sirs : <P> May I add to your article on Judiciary " Youngest " p. 14 issue of March 22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U. S. Senator Josh Lee who introduced and recommended him to the President were Alabama boys who had gone elsewhere and made good , just as have so many other Alabama boys ( not " Scottsboro boys " none of whom was from Alabama ) in the past . <P> It is interesting to note how fast Alabama boys skyrocket toward the top once they get away from the strenuous competition facing them here from thousands of other boys just as good . For instance , at least five of the nine Alabama boys composing the team at Alabama University when I was there ( Class of ' 21 ) landed directly into Big League Baseball-Joe Sewell , Luke Sewell ( still catching for Chicago White Sox ) , J. Riggs Stephenson , Lena Styles and Ike Boone . <P> SHELTON STREET Attorney at Law Gadsden , Ala . <P> Apparently so potent is Alabama 's influence that eloquent Senator Lee needed only three years ' residence there after birth to send him on to fame &; fortune .
