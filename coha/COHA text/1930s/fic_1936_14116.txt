The cocktail lounge of the Hotel Monte Gabriele . The hotel is a small one , which would like to consider itself a first-class resort . It was originally an Austrian sanatorium . Its Italian management has refurnished it and added this cocktail lounge and a few modern bedrooms with baths , in the hope that some day Monte Gabriele may become a rival for St. Moritz . So far , this is still a hope . Although the weather is fine , the supply of winter sports enthusiasts at Monte Gabriele is negligible , and the hotel is relying for its trade upon those itinerants who , because of the current political situation , are desirous of leaving Italy . Near at hand are a railway line into Switzerland , highways into Switzerland and Austria , and an Italian army airport . At the left , up-stage , is a large doorway , leading to the lobby , in which we can just see the Reception Desk . At the upper right is a staircase . A few steps up is a landing , above which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenery to the North and West . The panes are fringed with frost . From the landing , the stairs continue up to a gallery which leads to bedrooms off to the upper left . Downstairs left is a swinging door marked with the word " BAR . " Over this bar entrance are crossed skis and the head of a mountain goat . On the wall at the right is a Fascist emblem with crossed Italian flags . About the Reception Desk , off to the left , are signs assuring the guest that this hotel has been approved by all the automobile associations of Europe and that Travellers ' Cheques may be cashed here . Somewhere on the walls are pictures of the Coliseum and the S.S. " Conte di Savoia . " There are small tables and chairs about , with perhaps a couch or two . At the left is a piano , and when the first curtain rises a dismal little four-piece orchestra is playing " June in January . " Note a line in the dialogue along toward the end of Act One : there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of horror . " This is nothing definite , or identifiable , or even , immediately , apparent . Just an intimation . Behind the Reception Desk , PITTALUGA is occasionally visible . He is the proprietor of the hotel  --  a fussy , worried little Italian in the conventional morning coat and striped pants . On the landing at the upper right , looking dolefully out the window , is DONALD NAVADEL , a rather precious , youngish American , suitably costumed for winter sports by Saks Fifth Avenue . Experienced in the resort business , he was imported this year to organize sporting and social life at Monte Gabriele with a view to making it a Mecca for American tourists . He is not pleased with the way things have turned out . DUMPTSY comes in from the left . He is an humble , gentle little bell-boy , aged about forty , born in this district when it was part of Austria , but now a subject of the Fascist Empire . He has come in to clean the ash-trays . He listens to the music . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 ORCHESTRA LEADER Il pezzo si chiama : " Giugno in Gennaio . " DUMPTSY Oh , com'e bello ! Mi piace ! ( To DON . ) It 's good . DONALD NAVADEL Will you please for God 's sake stop playing that same damned tiresome thing ? DUMPTSY You do n't like it , Mr. Navadel ? DONALD NAVADEL I 'm so sick of it , I could scream ! DUMPTSY I like it . To me , it 's good . DONALD NAVADEL Go on , and clean the ash-trays . DUMPTSY But they 're not dirty , sir . Because there 's nobody using them . DONALD NAVADEL There 's no need to remind me of that ! Do as you 're told ! DUMPTSY If you please , sir . ( He whistles the tune and goes out . ) DONALD NAVADEL ( to the LEADER ) You 've played enough . Get out ! ORCHESTRA LEADER But it is not yet three o'clock . DONALD NAVADEL Never mind what time it is . There 's nobody here to listen to you , is there ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harpsichord and go grab yourselves a smoke . p. 4 ORCHESTRA LEADER Very good , Mr. Navadel . ( To the other musicians ) E inutile continuare a suonare . La gente non ascolta pi . Si potr invece far quattro chiacchiere e fumare una sigaretta . ( They put away instruments and music and start to go out , as PITTALUGA appears bristling . ) PITTALUGA ( to LEADER ) Eh , professori ? Perch avete cessato di suonare ? Non sono ancora le tre . ORCHESTRA LEADER Il Signor Navadel ci ha detta di andare a fumare egli ne ha avuto abbastanza della nostra musica . ( The MUSICIANS have gone . ) PITTALUGA ( going to DON ) You told my orchestra it would stop ? DONALD NAVADEL ( untroubled ) I did . PITTALUGA My orders to them are they play in here until three o'clock . Why do you take it to yourself to countermand my orders ? DONALD NAVADEL Because their performance was just a little too macabre to be bearable . PITTALUGA So ! You have made yourself the manager of this hotel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next you will be giving orders to me  --  and to the guests themselves , I have no doubt . p. 5 DONALD NAVADEL The guests ! ( He laughs drily . ) That 's really very funny . Consult your room chart , my dear Signor Pittaluga , and let me know how many guests there are that I can give orders to . The number when last I counted PITTALUGA And you stop being insolent , you  --  animale fetente . I pay you my money , when I am plunging myself into bankruptcy . DONALD NAVADEL Yes , yes , Signor  --  we know all about that . You pay me your money . And you have a right to know that I 'm fed to the teeth with this little pension that you euphemistically call a high-grade resort hotel . Indeed , I 'm fed to the teeth with your personally . PITTALUGA ( in a much friendlier tone ) Ah ! So you wish to leave us ! I 'm very sorry , my dear Donald . We shall miss you . DONALD NAVADEL My contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until then . PITTALUGA You insult me by saying you are fed with me , but you go on taking my money ? DONALD NAVADEL Yes ! PITTALUGA Pezzo mascalzone farabutto prepotente canaglia DONALD NAVADEL And it will do you no good to call me names in your native tongue . I 've had a conspicuously successful career in this business , all the way from Santa Barbara to St. Moritz . And you lured me away from a superb job p. 6 PITTALUGA ( as DON continues ) Lazzarone , briccone , bestione . Perdio . DONALD NAVADEL with your glowing descriptions of this handsome place , and the crowds of sportlovers , gay , mad , desperately chic , who were flocking here from London , Paris , New York . PITTALUGA Did I know what was going to happen ? Am I the king of Europe ? DONALD NAVADEL You are the proprietor of this obscure tavern . You 're presumably responsible for the fact that it 's a deadly , boring dump ! PITTALUGA Yes ! And I engaged you because I thought you had friends  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of St. Moritz , and Muerren , and Chamonix . And where are your friends ? What am I paying you for ? To countermand my orders and tell me you are fed ( Wails from warning sirens are heard from off-stage right . PITTALUGA stops short . Both listen . ) Che cosa succede ? DONALD NAVADEL That 's from down on the flying field . PITTALUGA It is the warning for the air raids ! ( AUGUSTE , the barman , is heard in bar off-stage , left. ) p. 7 AUGUSTE 'S VOICE Che cosa ? ( PITTALUGA and DON rush to the window . ) PITTALUGA Segnali d'incursione . La guerra e incominiciata e il nemico viene . ( Airplane motors are heard off right . ) DONALD NAVADEL ( looking through window ) Look ! The planes are taking off . They 're the little ones  --  the combat planes . ( CAPTAIN LOCICERO enters from the lobby . He is the officer in charge of the frontier station . He is tired , quiet , nice . AUGUSTE enters from the bar . DUMPTSY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LOCICERO Buona sera ! ( AUGUSTE helps him take off his coat . ) DUMPTSY Che cosa succede , Signor Capitano ? la guerra ? CAPTAIN LOCICERO No  --  no  --  datemi cognac . ( DUMPTSY puts coat on chair right of table and goes up and exits through arch center . CAPTAIN sits chair left of table . ) AUGUSTE ( as he goes out ) Si , signor Capitano . ( The CAPTAIN sits down at a table . PITTALUGA and DON cross to him . DUMPTSY goes. ) p. 8 PITTALUGA Che cosa significano quei terribili segnali ? , forse , il nemico che arriva ? DONALD NAVADEL What 's happened , Captain ? Is there an air raid ? Has the war started ? CAPTAIN LOCICERO ( smiling ) Who knows ? But there is no raid . ( The porter 's hand-bell in the lobby is heard . ) They 're only testing the sirens , to see how fast the combat planes can go into action . You understand  --  it 's like lifeboat drill on a ship . ( DUMPTSY enters . ) DUMPTSY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurries out . ) PITTALUGA Scusi . Vengo subito . Presto , presto ! ( He goes . ) CAPTAIN LOCICERO Have a drink , Mr. Navadel ? DONALD NAVADEL Thank you very much  --  but some guests are actually arriving . I must go and be very affable . ( He goes . DR . WALDERSEE appears on the gallery above and comes down the stairs as AUGUSTE enters from the bar and serves the CAPTAIN with brandy and soda . The DOCTOR is an elderly , stout , crotchetty , sad German. ) p. 9 CAPTAIN LOCICERO Good afternoon , Doctor . Have a drink ? DR . WALDERSEE Thank you very much  --  no . What is all that aeroplanes ? ( AUGUSTE goes . ) CAPTAIN LOCICERO This is a crucial spot , Dr. Waldersee . We must be prepared for visits from the enemy . DR . WALDERSEE Enemy , eh ? And who is that ? CAPTAIN LOCICERO I do n't quite know , yet . The map of Europe supplies us with a wide choice of opponents . I suppose , in due time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall know just whom we are to shoot at . DR . WALDERSEE Nonsense ! Obscene nonsense ! CAPTAIN LOCICERO Yes  --  yes . But the taste for obscenity is incurable , is n't it ? DR . WALDERSEE When will you let me go into Switzerland ? CAPTAIN LOCICERO Again I am powerless to answer you . My orders are that no one for the time being shall cross the frontiers , either into Switzerland or Austria . DR . WALDERSEE And when will this " time being " end ? CAPTAIN LOCICERO When Rome makes its decision between friend and foe . p. 10 DR . WALDERSEE I am a German subject . I am not your foe . CAPTAIN LOCICERO I am sure of that , Dr. Waldersee . The two great Fascist states stand together , against the world . DR . WALDERSEE ( passionately ) Fascism has nothing to do with it ! I am a scientist . I am a servant of the whole damn stupid human race . ( He crosses toward the CAPTAIN . ) If you delay me any longer here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? I must get my rats at once to the laboratory in Zurich , or all my months and years of research will have gone for nothing . ( DON enters , followed by MR. and MRS . CHERRY  --  a pleasant young English couple in the first flush of their honeymoon . ) DONALD NAVADEL This is our cocktail lounge . There is the American bar . We have a th dansant here every afternoon at 4:30  --  supper dancing in the evening . MR . CHERRY Charming . DONALD NAVADEL All this part of the hotel is new . Your rooms are up there . ( He crosses to the window . ) I think you 'll concede that the view from here is unparalleled . We can look into four countries . ( The CHERRYS follow him to the window . ) Here in the foreground , of course , is Italy . This was formerly Austrian territory , transferred by the treaty of Versailles . It 's called Monte Gabriele in honor of D'Annunzio , Italian poet and patriot . Off there is Switzerland and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the tip of a mountain peak that is in the Bavarian Tyrol . Rather gorgeous , is n't it ? p. 11 MR . CHERRY Yes . MRS . CHERRY Darling  --  look at that sky ! MR . CHERRY I say , it is rather good . DONALD NAVADEL Do you go in for winter sports , Mrs. Cherry ? MRS . CHERRY Oh , yes  --  I  --  we 're very keen on them . DONALD NAVADEL Splendid ! We have everything here . MR . CHERRY I 've usually gone to Kitzbuhel . ( PITTALUGA and DUMPTSY appear up-stage and speak in Italian through the dialogue . ) PITTALUGA Dumptsy , il bagaglio stato portato su ? DUMPTSY Si , signore , gi sopra . PITTALUGA Sta bene , vattene . DONALD NAVADEL It 's lovely there , too . MR . CHERRY But I hear it has become much too crowded there now . I  --  my wife and I hoped it would be quieter here . DONALD NAVADEL Well  --  at the moment  --  it is rather quiet here . PITTALUGA ( coming down ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you care to see your room now ? p. 12 MR . CHERRY Yes . Thank you . PITTALUGA If you will have the goodness to step this way . ( He goes up the stairs . ) ' Scuse me . MR . CHERRY ( pauses at the window on the way up ) What 's that big bare patch down there ? DONALD NAVADEL ( casually ) Oh , that 's the airport . ( PITTALUGA coughs disscreetly . ) We have a great deal of flying here . PITTALUGA Right this way , please . MR . CHERRY Oh  --  I see . ( They continue on up , preceded by PITTALUGA . ) DONALD NAVADEL And do come down for the th dansant . MRS . CHERRY We should love to . PITTALUGA Right straight ahead , please . ( They exit through gallery . ) DONALD NAVADEL ( standing on first step ) Honeymooners . CAPTAIN LOCICERO Yes  --  poor creatures . DONALD NAVADEL They wanted quiet . p. 13 DR . WALDERSEE ( rises ) Ach Gott ! When will you know when I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes through from Rome . ( The hand-bell is heard . ) You understand that I am only an obscure frontier official . And here in Italy , as in your own Germany , authority is centralized . DR . WALDERSEE But you can send a telegram to Rome , explaining the urgency of my position . ( DUMPTSY appears , greatly excited . ) DUMPTSY More guests from the bus , Mr. Navadel . Seven of them ! ( He goes . ) DONALD NAVADEL Good God ! ( He goes out . ) DR . WALDERSEE Ach , es gibt kein Ruhe hier . CAPTAIN LOCICERO I assure you , Dr. Waldersee , I shall do all in my power . DR . WALDERSEE They must be made to understand that time is of vital importance . CAPTAIN LOCICERO Yes , I know . DR . WALDERSEE I have no equipment here to examine them properly  --  no assistant for the constant observation that is essential if my experiments are to succeed p. 14 CAPTAIN LOCICERO ( a trifle wearily ) I 'm so sorry DR . WALDERSEE Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you do ? You have no comprehension of what is at stake . You are a soldier and indifferent to death . You say you are sorry , but it is nothing to you that hundreds of thousands , millions , are dying from a disease that it is within my power to cure ! CAPTAIN LOCICERO Again , I assure you , Dr. Waldersee , that I DON 'S VOICE Our Mr. Pittaluga will be down in a moment . In the meantime , perhaps you and the  --  the others ( He comes in , followed by HARRY VAN , a wan , thoughtful , lonely American vaudevillian promoter , press agent , book-agent , crooner , hoofer , barker or shill , who has undertaken all sorts of jobs in his time , all of them capitalizing his powers of salesmanship , and none of them entirely honest . He wears a snappy , belted , polo coat and a brown felt hat with brim turned down on all sides ) would care to sit here in the cocktail lounge . We have a th dansant here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you run this hotel ? DONALD NAVADEL I 'm the Social Manager . p. 15 HARRY VAN What ? DONALD NAVADEL The Social Manager . HARRY VAN Oh ! American , are n't you ? DONALD NAVADEL I am . Santa Barbara 's my home , and Donald Navadel is my name . HARRY VAN Happy to know you . My name 's Harry Van . ( They shake hands . ) DONALD NAVADEL Glad to have you here , Mr. Van . Are you  --  staying with us long ? DR . WALDERSEE ( rising ) I shall myself send a telegram to Rome , to the German Embassy . CAPTAIN LOCICERO They might well be able to expedite matters . ( The DOCTOR goes . ) HARRY VAN I 've got to get over that border . When I came in on the train from Fiume , they told me the border is closed , and the train is stuck here for to-night and maybe longer . I asked them why , but they either did n't know or they refused to divulge their secrets to me . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Locicero can help you . He 's the commander of Italian Headquarters here . This is Mr. Van , Captain . p. 16 CAPTAIN LOCICERO ( rising ) Mr. Van , my compliments . HARRY VAN And mine to you , Captain . We 're trying to get to Geneva . CAPTAIN LOCICERO You have an American passport ? HARRY VAN I have . Several of them . ( He reaches in his pocket and takes out seven passports , bound together with elastic . He fans them like a deck of cards and hands them to the CAPTAIN . ) CAPTAIN LOCICERO You have your family with you ? HARRY VAN Well  --  it is n't exactly a family . ( He goes to the right . ) Come in here , girls ! SHIRLEY ( from off-stage ) Come on in , kids . Harry wants us . ( Six blonde chorus girls come in . They are named : SHIRLEY , BEULAH , BEBE , FRANCINE , EDNA and ELAINE . Of these , SHIRLEY is the principal , a frank , knowing fan dancer . BEULAH is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hard , harsh little number who shimmies . DON does n't know quite how to take this surprising troupe , but the CAPTAIN is impressed , favorably . ) HARRY VAN Allow me to introduce the girls , Captain . We call them " Les Blondes . " We 've been playing the Balkan circuit  --  Budapest , Bucharest , Sofia , Belgrade , and Zagreb . ( He turns to DON . ) Back home , that would be the equivalent of " Pan Time . " ( He laughs nervously , to indicate that the foregoing was a gag. ) p. 17 CAPTAIN LOCICERO ( bowing ) How do you do ? HARRY VAN The Captain is head man , girls . GIRLS How do you do ? Pleased to meet you . Etc . HARRY VAN The situation in brief is this , Captain . We 've got very attractive bookings at a night spot in Geneva . Undoubtedly they feel that the League of Nations needs us . ( Another laugh . ) It 's important that we get there at once . So , Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LOCICERO ( looking at the first passport ) Miss Shirley Laughlin . HARRY VAN Laughlin . This is Shirley . Step up , honey . ( SHIRLEY steps forward . ) CAPTAIN LOCICERO ( pleased with SHIRLEY ) How do you do ? SHIRLEY Pleased to meet you . CAPTAIN LOCICERO This photograph hardly does you justice . SHIRLEY I know . It 's terrible , is n't it ! HARRY VAN ( interrupting ) Who 's next , Captain ? p. 18 CAPTAIN LOCICERO Miss Beulah Tremoyne . HARRY VAN Come on , Beulah . ( She comes forward in a wide sweep , as SHIRLEY goes up and joins the group . ) Beulah is our bubble dancer , a product of the sthetic school , and therefore more of a dreamer . CAPTAIN LOCICERO Exquisite ! BEULAH Thank you ever so much . ( She starts to sit down by the CAPTAIN . She is turning it on . ) HARRY VAN That 'll be all , Beulah . CAPTAIN LOCICERO Miss Elaine Messiger  --   --  HARRY VAN Come on , babe . CAPTAIN LOCICERO Miss Francine Merle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just identification . CAPTAIN LOCICERO Miss Edna Creesh  --   --  HARRY VAN Turn it off , honey . CAPTAIN LOCICERO And Miss Bebe Gould . HARRY VAN You 'll find Bebe a very , very lovely girl . BEBE ( remonstrating ) Harry ! p. 19 HARRY VAN A shimmy artiste , and incorrigibly unsophisticated . CAPTAIN LOCICERO ( summing up ) Very beautiful . Very , very beautiful . Mr. Van , I congratulate you . HARRY VAN That 's nice of you , Captain . Now , can we CAPTAIN LOCICERO And I wish I , too , were going to Geneva . ( He hands back the passports to HARRY . ) HARRY VAN Then it 's O.K. for us to pass ? CAPTAIN LOCICERO But wo n't you young ladies sit down ? SHIRLEY Thanks , Captain . BEULAH We 'd love to . FRANCINE He 's cute . EDNA I 'll say . ( They all sit . ) HARRY VAN I do n't want to seem oblivious of your courtesy , Captain , but the fact is we ca n't afford to hang around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave us . CAPTAIN LOCICERO I give you my word , that train will not move tonight , and maybe not to-morrow night , and maybe never . ( He bows deeply . ) It is a matter of the deepest personal regret to me , Mr. Van , but  --   --  p. 20 HARRY VAN Listen , pal . Could you stop being polite for just a moment , and tell us how do we get to Geneva ? CAPTAIN LOCICERO That is not for me to say . I am as powerless as you are , Mr. Van . I , too , am a pawn . ( He picks up his coat and hat . ) But , speaking for myself , I shall not be sorry if you and your beautiful companions are forced to remain here indefinitely . ( He salutes the girls , smiles and goes out . ) HARRY VAN Did you hear that ? He says he 's a pawn . BEBE He 's a Wop . BEULAH But he 's cute ! SHIRLEY Personally , I 'd just as soon stay here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day coaches . HARRY VAN After the way we 've been betrayed in the Balkans , we ca n't afford to stay any place . ( He turns to DON . ) What 's the matter , anyway ? Why ca n't decent respectable people be allowed to go about their legitimate business ? DONALD NAVADEL Evidently you 're not fully aware of the international situation . HARRY VAN I 'm fully aware that the international situation is always regrettable . But what 's wrong now ? p. 21 DONALD NAVADEL Have n't you been reading the papers ? HARRY VAN In Bulgaria and Jugo-Slavia ? ( He looks around at the girls , who laugh . ) No . DONALD NAVADEL It may be difficult for you to understand , Mr. Van , but we happen to be on the brink of a frightful calamity . HARRY VAN What ? DONALD NAVADEL We 're on the verge of War . SHIRLEY War ? BEBE What about ? HARRY VAN You mean  --  that business in Africa ? DONALD NAVADEL Far more serious than that ! World war ! All of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 'll be started by people like that ? ( Points after the CAPTAIN . ) Italians ? DONALD NAVADEL Yes . They 've reached the breaking point . HARRY VAN I do n't believe it . I do n't believe that people like that would take on the job of licking the world . They 're too romantic . ( PITTALUGA steps forward . ) PITTALUGA Do you wish rooms , Signor ? p. 22 HARRY VAN What have you got ? PITTALUGA We can give you grande luxe accommodations , rooms with baths . HARRY VAN What 's your scale of prices ? PITTALUGA From fifty lira up . DONALD NAVADEL That 's about five dollars a day . HARRY VAN ( wincing ) What ? DONALD NAVADEL Meals included . HARRY VAN I take it there 's the usual professional discount . PITTALUGA ( to DON ) Che cosa significa ? DONALD NAVADEL Mr. Van and the young ladies are artists . PITTALUGA Ebbene ? DONALD NAVADEL ( scornfully ) In America we give special rates to artists . PITTALUGA ( grimly ) Non posso , non posso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) DONALD NAVADEL I 'm sure Mr. Pittaluga will take care of you nicely , Mr. Van . He will show you attractive rooms on the other side of the hotel . They 're delightful . p. 23 HARRY VAN No doubt . But I want to see the accommodations . PITTALUGA Step this way , please . HARRY VAN Come on , girls . Now  --  I want two girls to a room , and a single room for me adjoining . I promised their mothers I 'd always be within earshot . Put on your shoes , Beulah . ( He goes out right , followed by the GIRLS , and DON . ) BEULAH ( as they go ) Why 's he kicking ? I think this place is attractive ! SHIRLEY Oh  --  you know Harry . He 's always got to have something to worry about . ( They have gone . ) MRS . CHERRY ( coming down ) What an extraordinary gathering ! MR .

CHERRY I think we 're going to like it here , are n't we , darling ? MRS . CHERRY Yes . You 'll find a lot to paint . MR . CHERRY No doubt . But I 'm not going to waste any time painting . MRS . CHERRY Why not , Jimmy ? You 've got to work and  --   --  MR . CHERRY Do n't ask " why not " in that laboriously girlish tone ! You know damned well why not ! MRS .

CHERRY God forbid that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion for pure and beautiful foolishness . So do n't irritate me by any further mention of work . MRS . CHERRY Very well , darling . If you 're going to be stinking about it ( He kisses her again . ) ( The DOCTOR comes in from the right and regards their love-making with scant enthusiasm . They look up and see him . They are n't embarrassed . ) MR . CHERRY How do you do ? p. 25 DR . WALDERSEE Do n't let me interrupt you . ( He rings a bell and sits down . ) MR . CHERRY It 's quite all right . We were just starting out for a walk . MRS . CHERRY The air is so marvellous up here , is n't it ? DR . WALDERSEE ( doubtfully ) Yes . ( DUMPTSY comes in from the right . ) MR . CHERRY Yes  --  we think so . Come on , darling . ( They go out at the back . ) DR . WALDERSEE Mineral water . DUMPTSY Yes , sir .

SECOND OFFICER Sono belle , proprio da far strabiliare. p. 26 THIRD OFFICER Forse sarrano stelle cinematografiche di Hollyvood . SECOND OFFICER E forse ora non ci rincrescer che abbiano cancellato la nostra licenza . ( They go into the bar . ) HARRY VAN ( coming in ) Good afternoon . DR . WALDERSEE Good afternoon . HARRY VAN Have a drink ? DR . WALDERSEE I am about to have one . HARRY VAN Mind if I join you ? ( He sits down near the DOCTOR . ) DR . WALDERSEE This is a public room . HARRY VAN ( whistles a snatch of a tune ) It 's a funny kind of situation , is n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? HARRY VAN All this stopping of trains ( DUMPTSY enters from the bar and serves the DOCTOR with a glass of mineral water ) and orders from Rome and we are on the threshold of calamity . DR . WALDERSEE To me it is not funny . ( He rises with his mineral water. ) p. 27 HARRY VAN Get me a Scotch . DUMPTSY With soda , sir ? HARRY VAN Yes . DUMPTSY If you please , sir . QUILLERY I will have a beer . DUMPTSY We have native or imported , sir . QUILLERY Native will do . DUMPTSY If you please , sir . ( He goes out . ) DR . WALDERSEE I repeat  --  to me it is not funny ! ( He bows . ) You will excuse me . HARRY VAN Certainly . See you later , pal . ( The DOCTOR goes . HARRY turns to QUILLERY . ) Friendly old bastard ! QUILLERY Quite ! But you were right . The situation is funny . There is always something essentially laughable in the thought of a lunatic asylum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are inside . HARRY VAN I guess so . I guess it is n't easy for Germans to see the comical side of things these days . Do you mind if I join you ? ( He rises and crosses to the left. ) p. 28 QUILLERY I beg of you to do so , my comrade . HARRY VAN I do n't like to thrust myself forward  --  ( He sits down )  --  but , you see , I travel with a group of blondes , and it 's always a relief to find somebody to talk to . Have you seen the girls ? QUILLERY Oh , yes . HARRY VAN Alluring , are n't they ? QUILLERY Very alluring . ( DUMPTSY comes in with the drinks and goes . ) ( HARRY takes out his chewing gum , wraps it in paper , places it in a silver snuff box , which he shows to QUILLERY . ) HARRY VAN That 's a genuine antique snuff box of the period of Louis Quinze . QUILLERY Very interesting . HARRY VAN It 's museum piece . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to hoard your gum here in Europe . QUILLERY You 've travelled far ? HARRY VAN Yeah  --  I 've been a long way with that gorgeous array of beautiful girls . I took ' em from New York to Monte Carlo . To say we were a sensation in Monte Carlo would be to state a simple incontrovertible fact . But then I made the mistake of accepting an offer from the manager of the Club Arizona in Budapest . I found that conditions in the South-East are not so good . p. 29 QUILLERY I travelled on the train with you from Zagreb . HARRY VAN Zagreb ! A plague spot ! What were you doing there ? QUILLERY I was attending the Labor Congress . HARRY VAN Yeah  --  I heard about that . The night club people thought that the congress would bring in a lot of business . They were wrong .

SIGNOR and SIGNORA ROSSI come in and cross to the bar . ROSSI is a consumptive . ) SIGNOR ROSSI Abbiamo trascorso una bella giornata , Nina . Beviamo un po ' ? p. 30 SIGNORA ROSSI Dopo tutto quell ' esercizio ti farebbe male . Meglio che tu ti riposi per un'oretta . SIGNOR ROSSI Ma , no mi sento proprio bene . Andiamo . Mi riposer pi tardi . ( They go into the bar . ) HARRY VAN I get an awful kick hearing Italian . It 's beautiful . Do you speak it ? QUILLERY Only a little . I was born in France . And I love my home . Perhaps if I had raised pigs  --  like my father , and all his fathers , back to the time when Csar 's Roman legions came  --  perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a Frenchman , as they were . But I went to work in a factory  --  and machinery is international . HARRY VAN And I suppose pigs are exclusively French ? QUILLERY My father 's pigs are ! ( HARRY laughs . ) The factory where I have worked made artificial limbs  --  an industry that has been prosperous the last twenty years . But sometimes  --  in the evening  --  after my work  --  I would go out into the fields and help my father . And then , for a little while , I would become again a Frenchman . HARRY VAN ( takes out his cigarette case ) That 's a nice thought , pal . ( Offers QUILLERY a cigarette . ) Have a smoke ? p. 31 QUILLERY No , thank you . HARRY VAN I do n't blame you . These Jugo-Slav cigarettes are not made of the same high-grade quality of manure to which I grew accustomed in Bulgaria . QUILLERY You know , my comrade  --  you seem to have a long view of things . HARRY VAN So long that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to sustain in this short-sighted world . HARRY VAN You 're right about that , pal . QUILLERY Let me give you an instance : There we were  --  gathered in Zagreb , representatives of the workers of all Europe . All brothers , collaborating harmoniously for the United Front ! And now  --  we are rushing to our homes to prevent our people from plunging into mass murder  --  mass suicide ! HARRY VAN You 're going to try to stop the war ? QUILLERY Yes . HARRY VAN Do you think you 'll succeed ? QUILLERY Unquestionably ! This is not 1914 , remember ! Since then , some new voices have been heard in this world  --  loud voices . I need mention only one of them  --  Lenin  --  Nikolai Lenin ! ( A ferocious looking MAJOR of the Italian flying corps comes in and goes quickly to the bar . As he opens the door , he calls " Attention ! " He goes into the bar , the door swinging to behind him. ) p. 32 HARRY VAN Yes  --  but what are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ! That 's all we have to do . Expose them  --  for what they are  --  atavistic children ! Occupying their undeveloped minds playing with outmoded toys . HARRY VAN Have you seen any of those toys ? QUILLERY Yes ! France is full of them . But there is a force more potent than all the bombing planes and submarines and tanks . And that is the mature intelligence of the workers of the world ! There is one antidote for war  --  Revolution ! And the cause of Revolution gains steadily in strength . Even here in Italy , despite all the repressive power of Fascism , sanity has survived , and it becomes more and more articulate . HARRY VAN Well , pal  --  you 've got a fine point there . And I hope you stick to it . QUILLERY I 'm afraid you think it is all futile idealism ! HARRY VAN No  --  I do n't . And what if I did ? I am an idealist myself . QUILLERY You too believe in the revolution ? HARRY VAN Not necessarily in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anything that will make people wake up , and get themselves some convictions . Have you ever taken cocaine ? p. 33 QUILLERY Why  --  I imagine that I have  --  at the dentist 's . HARRY VAN No  --  I mean , for pleasure . You know  --  a vice . QUILLERY No ! I 've never indulged in that folly . HARRY VAN I have  --  during a stage of my career when luck was bad and confusion prevailed . QUILLERY Ah , yes . You needed delusions of grandeur . HARRY VAN That 's just what they were . QUILLERY It must have been an interesting experience . HARRY VAN It was illuminating . It taught me what is the precise trouble with the world to-day . We have become a race of drug addicts  --  hopped up with false beliefs  --  false fears  --  false enthusiasms . ( The four OFFICERS emerge from the bar , talking excitedly . ) SECOND OFFICER Ma , state fatta la dichiarazone di guerra attuale ? FIRST OFFICER Caricheremo delle bombe esplosive ? THIRD OFFICER Se la guerra veramente in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La guerra in cominciata fra l'Italia e la Francia . ( All the above speeches are said together , as the MAJOR enters from the bar. ) p. 34 MAJOR Silenzio ! Solo il vostro commandante conosce gli ordini . Andiamo ! ( All five go out hurriedly . ) QUILLERY ( jumps up ) Mother of God ! Did you hear what they were saying ? HARRY VAN ( rises ) I heard , but I could n't understand . QUILLERY It was about war . I know only a little Italian  --  but I thought they were saying that war has already been declared . ( He grabs his hat . ) I must go and demand that they let me cross the border ! At once ! ( He starts to go . ) HARRY VAN That 's right , pal . There 's no time to lose . QUILLERY Wait  --  I have n't paid . ( He is fumbling for money . ) HARRY VAN No , no . This was my drink . You 've got to hurry ! QUILLERY Thank you , my comrade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard , off at the right . HARRY crosses to the window . DUMPTSY comes in to remove the empty glasses . ) DUMPTSY Fine view , is n't it , sir ? p. 35 HARRY VAN I 've seen worse . DUMPTSY Nothing quite like it , sir . From here , we look into four nations . Where you see that little village , at the far end of the valley  --  that is Austria . Is n't that beautiful over there ? HARRY VAN Are you Italian ? DUMPTSY Well , yes , sir . That is to say , I did n't used to be . HARRY VAN What did you used to be ? DUMPTSY Austrian . All this part was Austria , until after the big war , when they decided these mountains must go to Italy , and I went with them . In one day , I became a foreigner . So now , my children learn only Italian in school , and when I and my wife talk our own language they ca n't understand us . ( He gets HARRY 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed the name of this mountain . Monte Gabriele  --  that 's what it is now . They named it after an Italian who dropped poems on Vienna . Even my old father  --  he 's dead  --  but all the writing on the gravestones was in German , so they rubbed it out and translated it . So now he 's Italian , too . But they did n't get my sister . She married a Swiss . She lives over there , in Schleins . HARRY VAN She 's lucky . DUMPTSY Yes  --  those Swiss are smart . p. 36 HARRY VAN Yeah , they had sense enough to get over there in the first place . DUMPTSY ( laughs ) But it does n't make much difference who your masters are . When you get used to them , they 're all the same . ( The Porter 's bell rings . PITTALUGA appears . ) PITTALUGA Dumptsy ! Dumptsy ! Una gentildonna arriva . Prendi i suoi bagagli . Affretati ! DUMPTSY Si , Signore . Vengo subito . ( He goes . ) PITTALUGA ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Dove sei stata , va sopra a preparare la stanza . ( ANNA , the maid , enters with towels . ) Presto , presto ! ( ANNA runs up the steps , exits . PITTALUGA goes back into the lobby . ) IRENE 'S VOICE Vieni , Achille . DONALD NAVADEL ( coming in ) This is our cocktail lounge , madame . ( IRENE enters . She is somewhere between thirty and forty , beautiful , heavily and smartly furred in the Russian manner . Her hair is blonde and quite straight . She is a model of worldly wisdom , chic , and carefully applied graciousness . Her name is pronounced " EAR-RAY-NA . " She surveys the room with polite appreciation , glancing briefly at HARRY. ) p. 37 DONALD NAVADEL Your suite is up there , madame . All this part of the hotel is quite new . IRENE How very nice ! DONALD NAVADEL We have our best view from this side of the hotel . ( He goes to the window . IRENE follows slowly . ) You can see four countries  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! DONALD NAVADEL Yes  --  we 're very proud of it . IRENE All those countries . And they all look so very much alike , do n't they ! DONALD NAVADEL Yes  --  they do really  --  from this distance . IRENE All covered with the beautiful snow . I think the whole world should be always covered with snow . It would be so much more clean , would n't it ? DONALD NAVADEL By all means ! IRENE Like in my Russia . White Russia . ( Sighs , and goes up to the next landing . ) Oh , and  --  how exciting ! A flying field . Look ! They 're bringing out the big bombers . DONALD NAVADEL Madame is interested in aviation ? p. 38 IRENE No , no . Just ordinary flying bores me . But there is no experience in life quite so thrilling as a parachute jump , is there ! DONALD NAVADEL I 've never had that thrill , I 'm ashamed to say . IRENE Once I had to jump when I was flying over the jungle in Indo-China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that great green sea of enchantment and hidden danger . ( DUMPTSY comes in . ) DONALD NAVADEL And you were n't afraid ? IRENE No  --  no  --  I was not afraid . In moments like that , one is given the sense of eternity . HARRY VAN ( viciously ) Dumptsy ! Get me another Scotch . DUMPTSY Yes , sir . HARRY VAN And put ice in it , this time . If you have n't got any ice , go out and scoop up some snow . DUMPTSY If you please , sir . ( He goes into the bar . ) IRENE ( her gaze wandering about the room ) But your place is really charming . DONALD NAVADEL You 're very kind . p. 39 IRENE I must tell every one in Paris about it . There 's something about this design  --  it suggests a  --  an amusing kind of horror . DONALD NAVADEL ( not knowing quite how to interpret that ) Madame is a student of decoration ? IRENE No , no . Only an amateur , my friend . An amateur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ siren sounds from off at the right . IRENE , near the top of the staircase , stops to listen . ) IRENE What is that ? DONALD NAVADEL Oh  --  it 's merely some kind of warning . They 've been testing it . IRENE Warning ? Warning against what ? DONALD NAVADEL I believe it 's for use in case of war . IRENE War ? But there will be no war . ( PITTALUGA enters from the lobby , escorting ACHILLE WEBER  --  which is pronounced " VAYBAIR . " He is a thin , keen executive , wearing a neat little mustache and excellent clothes . In his lapel is the rosette of the Legion of Honor . He carries a brief case . ) PITTALUGA ( as they come in ) Par ici , Monsieur Weber . Vous trouverez Madame ici p. 40 IRENE ( leaning over the railing ) Achille ! ACHILLE WEBER ( pausing and looking up ) Yes , my dear ? IRENE Achille  --  there will be no war , will there ? ACHILLE WEBER ( amused ) No , no  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all much too well prepared for it . ( He turns to PITTALUGA . ) Where are our rooms ? PITTALUGA Votre suite est par ici , Monsieur . La plus belle de la maison ! La vue est superbe ! IRENE ( to DON ) There , you see ! They will not fight . They are all much too much afraid of each other . ( WEBER is going up the staircase , ignoring the view . PITTALUGA is following . ) IRENE ( to WEBER ) Achille  --  I am mad about this place ! Je rafolle de cette place ! ACHILLE WEBER ( calmly ) Yes , my dear . IRENE We must be sure to tell the Maharajah of Rajpipla , Achille . Ca n't you imagine how dear little " Pip " would love this ? ( They go out on the landing above. ) p. 41 HARRY VAN Who was that ? DONALD NAVADEL ( impressed ) That was Achille Weber . One of the biggest men in France . I used to see him a lot at St. Moritz . ( There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) HARRY VAN And the dame ? Do you assume that is his wife ? DONALD NAVADEL ( curtly ) Are you implying that she 's not ? HARRY VAN No , no  --  I 'm not implying a thing . ( He wanders to the piano . ) I 'm just kind of  --  kind of baffled . DONALD NAVADEL Evidently . ( He goes out . ) ( HARRY at the piano strikes a chord of the Russian song , " Kak Stranna . " DUMPTSY enters from the bar and serves HARRY with Scotch . The off-stage noise increases as more planes take the air . ) DUMPTSY ( at the window ) Do you see them  --  those aeroplanes  --  flying up from the field down there ? HARRY VAN ( glances toward window , without interest ) Yes  --  I see them . DUMPTSY Those are the big ones . They 're full of bombs , to drop on people . Look ! They 're going north . Maybe Berlin . Maybe Paris . ( HARRY strikes a few chords. ) p. 42 HARRY VAN Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no  --  sir . ( He looks questioningly at HARRY . ) HARRY VAN Well , I have  --  a couple of times . And it 's nothing . But  --  I did n't land in any jungle . I landed where I was supposed to  --  in the Fair Grounds . DUMPTSY ( seriously ) That 's interesting , sir . ( The ROSSIS enter from the bar . He is holding a handkerchief to his mouth . She is supporting him as they cross . ) SIGNORA ROSSI Non t'ho detto che dovevi fare attenzione ? Te l'ho detto , te l'ho detto che sarebbe accaduto ci . Vedi , ora ti piglia un accesso di tosse . SIGNOR ROSSI ' Scusatemi , Mina . ( Another coughing fit . ) SIGNORA ROSSI Va a sdraiarti . Dovresti riposarti a lungo . E adopera il termometro . Scometto che t ' aumentata la temperatura . ( They go out . ) DUMPTSY That Signor Rossi  --  he has tuberculosis . HARRY VAN Is he getting cured up here ? ( The DOCTOR appears on the landing above. ) p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the old days . But the Fascisti  --  they do n't like to admit that any one can be sick ! ( He starts to go . ) DR . WALDERSEE Dumptsy ! DUMPTSY Herr Doctor . DR . WALDERSEE ( coming down ) Mineral water . DUMPTSY Ja wohl , Herr Doctor . ( DUMPTSY goes out , left . The DOCTOR sits down . HARRY takes one more look toward the gallery , where IRENE had been . He then looks at the DOCTOR , and decides not to suggest joining him . He starts to play " Kak Stranna . " The DOCTOR turns and looks at him , with some surprise . The uproar of planes is now terrific , but it starts to dwindle as the planes depart . ) DR . WALDERSEE What is that you are playing ? HARRY VAN A Russian song , entitled " Kak Stranna , " meaning " how strange ! " One of those morose ballads about how once we met , for one immortal moment , like ships that pass in the night . Or maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And now we meet again ! How strange ! DR . WALDERSEE You are a musician ? p. 44 HARRY VAN Certainly . I used to play the piano in picture theatres  --  when that was the only kind of sound they had  --  except the peanuts . ( DUMPTSY brings in the mineral water and stops to listen , admiringly . ) DR . WALDERSEE Do you know Bach ? HARRY VAN With pleasure . ( He shifts into something or other by Bach . ) DR . WALDERSEE ( after a moment ) You have good appreciation , but not much skill . HARRY VAN What do you mean , not much skill ? Listen to this . ( He goes into a trick arrangement of " The Waters of the Minnetonka . " ) " The Waters of the Minnetonka "  --  Cadman . ( He goes on playing . ) Suitable for Scenics  --  Niagara Falls by moonlight . Or  --  if you play it this way  --  it goes fine with the scene where the young Indian chief turns out to be a Yale man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " Dimples " ) Walker . ( Starts playing " Boola , Boola . " ) DR . WALDERSEE Will you have a drink ? HARRY VAN Oh ! So you want me to stop playing ? p. 45 DR . WALDERSEE No , no ! I like your music very much . HARRY VAN Then , in that case , I 'd be delighted to drink with you . Another Scotch , Dumptsy . DUMPTSY If you please , sir . ( He goes out . ) DR . WALDERSEE I 'm afraid I was rude to you . HARRY VAN That 's all right , pal . I 've been rude to lots of people , and never regretted it . ( He plays on , shifting back into " Kak Stranna . " ) DR . WALDERSEE The fact is , I am a man who is very gravely distressed . HARRY VAN I can see that , Doctor . And I sympathize with you . DR . WALDERSEE ( fiercely ) You can not sympathize with me , because you do not know ! HARRY VAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a general way . DR . WALDERSEE You are familiar with the writings of Thomas Mann . ( It is a challenge , rather than a question . ) HARRY VAN I 'm afraid not , pal . ( The DOCTOR opens " The Magic Mountain , " which he has been reading. ) p. 46 DR . WALDERSEE " Backsliding " he said " spiritual backsliding to that dark and tortured age  --  that , believe me , is disease ! A degradation of mankind  --  a degradation painful and offensive to conceive . " True words , eh ? HARRY VAN Absolutely ! ( DUMPTSY comes in with the Scotch . HARRY gets up from the piano and crosses . DUMPTSY goes . HARRY sits down with the DOCTOR . ) DR . WALDERSEE Have you had any experience with the disease of cancer ? HARRY VAN Certainly . I once sold a remedy for it . DR . WALDERSEE ( exploding ) There is no remedy for it , so far ! HARRY VAN Well  --  this was kind of a remedy for everything . DR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer ! You probably have not heard of Fibiger , I suppose ? HARRY VAN I may have . I 'm not sure . DR . WALDERSEE He was a Dane  --  experimented with rats . He did good work , but he died before it could be completed . I carry it on . I have been working with Oriental rats , in Bologna . But because of this war scare , I must go to neutral territory . You see , nothing must be allowed to interfere with my experiments . Nothing ! p. 47 HARRY VAN No . They 're important . DR . WALDERSEE The laboratory of the University of Zurich has been placed at my disposal  --  and in Switzerland , I can work , undisturbed . I have twenty-eight rats with me , all in various carefully tabulated stages of the disease . It is the disease of civilization  --  and I can cure it . And now they say I must not cross the border . HARRY VAN You know , Doctor , it is funny . DR . WALDERSEE What 's funny ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it 's just that you and I are in the same fix . Both trying to get across that line . You with rats  --  me with girls . Of course  --  I appreciate the fact that civilization at large wo n't suffer much if we get stuck in the war zone . Whereas with you , there 's a lot at stake DR . WALDERSEE It is for me to win one of the greatest victories of all time . And the victory belongs to Germany . HARRY VAN Sure it does ! DR . WALDERSEE Unfortunately , just now the situation in Germany is not good for research . They are infected with the same virus as here . Chauvinistic nationalism ! They expect all bacteriologists to work on germs to put in bombs to drop from airplanes . To fill people with death ! When we 've given our lives to save people . Oh  --  God in heaven  --  why do n't they let me do what is good ? Good for the whole world ? Forgive me . I become excited . p. 48 HARRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Back in 1918 , I was a shill with a carnival show , and I was doing fine . The boss thought very highly of me . He offered to give me a piece of the show , and I had a chance to get somewhere . And then what do you think happened ? Along comes the United States Government and they drafted me ! You 're in the army now ! They slapped me into a uniform and for three whole months before the Armistice , I was parading up and down guarding the Ashokan Reservoir . They were afraid your people might poison it . I 've always figured that that little interruption ruined my career . But I 've remained an optimist , Doctor . DR . WALDERSEE You can afford to . HARRY VAN I 've remained an optimist because I 'm essentially a student of human nature . You dissect corpses and rats and similar unpleasant things . Well ,  --  it has been my job to dissect suckers ! I 've probed into the souls of some of the God-damnedest specimens . And what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Doctor  --  but above everything else I 've found Faith . Faith in peace on earth and good will to men  --  and faith that " Muma , " " Muma " the three-legged girl , really has got three legs . All my life , Doctor , I 've been selling phoney goods to people of meagre intelligence and great faith . You 'd think that would make me contemptuous of the human race , would n't you ? But  --  on the contrary  --  it has given me Faith . It has made me sure that no matter how much the meek may be bulldozed or gypped they will eventually inherit the earth . ( SHIRLEY and BEBE come in from the lobby. ) p. 49 SHIRLEY Harry ! HARRY VAN What is it , honey ? ( SHIRLEY goes to HARRY and hands him a printed notice . ) SHIRLEY ( excited ) Did you see this ? HARRY VAN Doctor  --  let me introduce , Miss Shirley Laughlin and Miss Bebe Gould . SHIRLEY How do you do ? DR . WALDERSEE ( grunts ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Doctor . ( HARRY looks at the notice . ) SHIRLEY They got one of those put up in every one of of our rooms . HARRY VAN ( showing it to the DOCTOR ) Look  --  " What to do in case of air-raids "  --  in all languages . DR . WALDERSEE Ja  --  I saw that . SHIRLEY Give it back to me , Harry . I 'm going to send it to Mama . HARRY VAN ( handling it to her ) Souvenir of Europe . SHIRLEY It 'll scare the hell out of her . p. 50 BEBE What 's the matter with these people over here ? Are they all screwy ? HARRY VAN Bebe  --  you hit it right on the nose ! ( Turns to the DOCTOR . ) I tell you , Doctor  --  these are very wonderful , profound girls . The mothers of tomorrow ! ( He beams on them . BEULAH comes in . ) SHIRLEY Oh  --  shut up ! BEULAH Say  --  Harry HARRY VAN What is it , honey ? BEULAH Is it all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn how to do this ski-ing ? ( WEBER comes out on the gallery and starts down . ) HARRY VAN What ? And risk those pretty legs ? Emphatically  --  no ! BEULAH But it 's healthy . HARRY VAN Not for me , dear . Those gams of yours are my bread and butter . ( WEBER crosses . They look at him . He glances briefly at them . ) Sit down , girls , and amuse yourselves with your own thoughts . ( The GIRLS sit . WEBER , at the left , lights his cigar . The CAPTAIN comes in , quickly , obviously worried. ) p. 51 CAPTAIN LOCICERO I have been trying to get through to headquarters , Monsieur Weber . ACHILLE WEBER And when can we leave ? CAPTAIN LOCICERO Not before to-morrow , I regret to say . ( IRENE appears on the gallery . ) ACHILLE WEBER Signor Lanza in Venice assured me there would be no delay . CAPTAIN LOCICERO There would be none , if only I could get into communication with the proper authorities . But  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of uproar . ACHILLE WEBER It 's absurd lack of organization . ( The PIANIST and DRUMMER come in from the lobby . The VIOLINIST and SAXOPHONIST follow . ) CAPTAIN LOCICERO ( with tense solemnity ) There is good excuse for the excitement now , Monsieur Weber . The report has just come to us that a state of war exists between Italy and France . HARRY VAN What ? CAPTAIN LOCICERO There is a rumor of war between Italy and France ! HARRY VAN Rumors  --  rumors  --  everything 's rumors ! When are we going to know ? p. 52 CAPTAIN LOCICERO Soon enough , my friend . DR . WALDERSEE And what of Germany ? CAPTAIN LOCICERO Germany has mobilized . ( IRENE pauses to listen . ) But I do n't know if any decision has been reached . Nor do I know anything of the situation anywhere else . But  --  God help us  --  it will be serious enough for everyone on this earth . ( IRENE joins WEBER , who has sat down at the left . ) IRENE ( to WEBER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all too well prepared , Achille . Has there been some mistake somewhere ? ACHILLE WEBER ( confidentially ) We can only attribute it to spontaneous combustion of the dictatorial ego . IRENE ( grimly ) I can imagine how thrilling it must be in Paris at this moment . Just like 1914 . All the lovely soldiers  --  singing  --  marching  --  marching ! We must go at once to Paris , Achille . HARRY VAN ( rises ) What 's the matter with the music , professor ? Us young folks want to dance . ( ELAINE and FRANCINE come in. ) p. 53 ELAINE Can we have a drink now , Harry ? HARRY VAN Sure . Sit down . ( Don enters , excluding gratification at the sight of this gay , chic throng . The ORCHESTRA starts to play " Valencia . " ) ACHILLE WEBER Will you have a drink , Irene ? IRENE No , thank you . ACHILLE WEBER Will you , Captain Locicero ? DR . WALDERSEE Thank you . Brandy and soda , Dumpsty . DUMPTSY Si , Signor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a drink ! ( EDNA comes in . ) ACHILLE WEBER For me , Cinzano . DUMPTSY Oui , Monsieur . ( He goes into the bar . ) DR . WALDERSEE It is all incredible . HARRY VAN Nevertheless , Doctor , I remain an optimist . ( He looks at IRENE . ) Let doubt prevail throughout this night  --  with dawn will come again the light of truth ! ( He turns to SHIRLEY . ) Come on , honey  --  let 's dance . ( They dance . DON dances with BEULAH . The ORCHESTRA continues with its spirited but frail performance of " Valencia . " There are probably " border incidents " in Lorraine , the Riviera , Poland . Czecho-Slovakia and Mongolia. ) @x It is about 7:30 in the evening of the same day . The CHERRYS are seated , both of them dressed for dinner . AUGUSTE is serving them cocktails . MR .

( They drink , solemnly. ) p. 56 MRS . CHERRY Jimmy  --   --  MR . CHERRY What is it , darling ? MRS . CHERRY Were you just saying that  --  or do you believe it ? MR . CHERRY That you 're lovely ? I can give you the most solemn assurance . MRS . CHERRY No  --  that nothing is going to happen . MR . CHERRY Oh . MRS . CHERRY Do you believe that ? MR . CHERRY I know this much : they ca n't start any real war without England . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our people simply wo n't stand for it . MRS . CHERRY But people can be such complete fools . MR .

CHERRY We 're very conceited , are n't we ? MR . CHERRY Of course . And for good and sufficient reason . MRS . CHERRY I 'm glad we 're so superior , darling . It 's comforting . ( HARRY comes in from bar. ) p. 57 MR . CHERRY Oh  --  good evening , Mr. Van . HARRY VAN Good evening . Pardon me  --  ( He starts to go . ) MR . CHERRY Oh  --  do n't run away , Mr. Van . Let 's have some music . MRS . CHERRY Wo n't you have a drink with us ? HARRY VAN No , thanks , Mrs. Cherry  --  if you do n't mind . ( Sits down at the piano . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon .

HARRY VAN Thanks , pal  --  always grateful for applause from the discriminating . ( Finishes the chorus and stops . ) MR . CHERRY Do play some more . HARRY VAN No . The mood is n't right . MRS . CHERRY I ca n't tell you what a relief it is to have you here in this hotel . HARRY VAN It 's kind of you to say that , Mrs. Cherry . But I do n't deserve your handsome tribute . Frequently , I can be an asset to any gathering  --  contributing humorous anecdotes and bits of homely philosophy . But here and now , I 'm far from my best . p. 58 MR . CHERRY You 're the only one here who seems to have retained any degree of sanity . MRS . CHERRY You and your young ladies . HARRY VAN The girls are lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me is that I just do n't give a damn . MRS . CHERRY We 've been trying hard not to know anything  --  or not to give a damn . But it is n't easy . HARRY VAN You have n't been married very long , have you ? I hope you do n't mind my asking . MR . CHERRY We were married the day before yesterday . HARRY VAN Let me offer my congratulations . MR . CHERRY Thank you very much . HARRY VAN It 's my purely intuitive hunch that you two ought to get along fine . MR . CHERRY That 's our intention , Mr. Van . MRS . CHERRY And we 'll do it , what 's more . You see  --  we have one supreme thing in common : HARRY VAN Yeah ? MRS . CHERRY We 're both independent . MR . CHERRY We 're like you Americans , in that respect . p. 59 HARRY VAN You flatter us . MRS . CHERRY Jimmy 's a painter . HARRY VAN You do n't say ! MRS . CHERRY He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some government building . He wo n't show me the photographs of them , but I 'm sure they 're simply awful . ( She laughs fondly . ) MR . CHERRY They 're allegorical . ( He laughs , too . ) HARRY VAN I 'll bet they 're good , at that . What do you do , Mrs. Cherry ? MRS . CHERRY Oh , I work in the gift department at Fortnum 's  --   --  HARRY VAN Behind a counter , eh ! MRS . CHERRY Yes  --  wearing a smock , and disgracing my family . HARRY VAN Well , what d'ye know ! MRS . CHERRY Both our families hoped we 'd be married in some nice little church , and settle down in a nice little cottage , in a nice little state of decay . But when I heard Jimmy was on the way home I just dropped everything and rushed down here to meet him  --  and we were married , in Florence . MR . CHERRY We had n't seen each other for nearly a year  --  so , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HARRY VAN I can imagine . MRS . CHERRY Florence is the most perfect place in the world to be married in . HARRY VAN I guess that 's true of any place . MR . CHERRY We both happen to love Italy . And  --  I suppose  --  we 're both rather on the romantic side . HARRY VAN You stay on that side , no matter what happens . MRS . CHERRY ( quickly ) What do you think is going to happen ? HARRY VAN Me ? I have n't the slightest idea . MR . CHERRY We 've looked forward so much to being here with no one bothering us , and plenty of winter sports . We 're both keen on ski-ing . And now  --  we may have to go dashing back to England at any moment . MRS . CHERRY It 's rotten luck , is n't it ? HARRY VAN Yes , Mrs. Cherry . That 's what it is  --  it 's rotten . ( QUILLERY enters from the bar , reading a newspaper . ) So they would n't let you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news ? QUILLERY ( glaring ) News ! Not in this patriotic journal !

HARRY VAN You 're a sort of Y.M.C.A. secretary  --  who sees to it that all the guests get together and have a good time . DONALD NAVADEL Well ? HARRY VAN Well  --  do you think you 're doing a very good job of it right now ? DONALD NAVADEL ( simply furious ) Have you any suggestions for improving the performance of my duties ?

( IRENE appears on the gallery and starts to come down . She is wearing a dinner dress . ) HARRY VAN Now be careful , Don . One more word like that and the offer is withdrawn ( DON cautions him to silence . ) DONALD NAVADEL It 's splendid idea , Mr. Van . We 'll all greatly appreciate your little entertainment , I 'm sure . ( To IRENE . ) Good evening , Madame . IRENE ( with the utmost graciousness ) Good evening , Mr. Navadel .

Do sit down , Madame . IRENE ( sitting ) What became of those planes that flew off this afternoon ? I have n't heard them come back . ( Takes out a cigarette . ) DONALD NAVADEL I imagine they were moving to some base farther from the frontier . I hope so . They always made the most appalling racket . ( Lights her cigarette for her . ) HARRY VAN About eleven o'clock ? ( WEBER appears on the gallery . ) DONALD NAVADEL Yes , Mr. Van . Eleven will do nicely . You 'll have a cocktail , Madame ? ( HARRY goes into the lobby . ) IRENE No , no . Vodka , if you please . DONALD NAVADEL I shall have it sent right in . ( He goes off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after HARRY . She smiles slightly .

( He comes on down. ) p. 70 IRENE Did you get your call ? ACHILLE WEBER Yes . I talked to Lanza . IRENE I gather the news is , as usual , good . ACHILLE WEBER It is extremely serious ! You saw those bombers that left here this afternoon ? IRENE Yes . ACHILLE WEBER They were headed for Paris . Italy is evidently in a great hurry to deliver the first blow . IRENE How soon may we leave here ? ACHILLE WEBER None too soon , I can assure you . The French high command will know that the bombers come from this field . There will be reprisals  --  probably within the next twenty-four hours . IRENE That will be exciting to see . ACHILLE WEBER An air raid ? IRENE Yes  --  with bombs bursting in the snow . Sending up great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us . IRENE ( after a moment ) I suppose many people in Paris are being killed now . ACHILLE WEBER I 'm afraid so . Unless the Italians bungle it . p. 71 IRENE Perhaps your sister  --  Madame d'Hilaire  --  perhaps she and her darling little children are now dying . ACHILLE WEBER ( sharply ) My sister and her family are in Montbeliard . IRENE But you said the Italians might bungle it . They might drop their bombs on the wrong place . ACHILLE WEBER I appreciate your solicitude , my dear . But you can save your condolences until they are needed . ( DUMPTSY comes in from the bar and serves the vodka . WEBER rises . ) I must telegraph to Joseph to have the house ready . It will be rather cold in Biarritz now  --  but far healthier than Paris . You are going in to dinner now ? IRENE Yes . ACHILLE WEBER I shall join you later . ( He goes out .

( She downs the vodka . ) DUMPTSY Madame is Russian , if I may say so . IRENE ( pleased ) How did you know that I am Russian ? Just because I am having vodka ? DUMPTSY No , Madame . Many people try to drink vodka . But only true Russians can do it gracefully . You see  --  I was a prisoner with your people in the war . I liked them . IRENE You 're very charming . What is your name ? DUMPTSY I am called Dumptsy , Madame . IRENE Are you going again to the war , Dumptsy ? DUMPTSY If they tell me to , Madame . IRENE You will enjoy being a soldier ? DUMPTSY Yes  --  if I 'm taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will win ? DUMPTSY I ca n't think , Madame . It is all very doubtful . But one thing I can tell you : whoever wins , it will be the same as last time  --  Austria will lose . p. 73 IRENE They will all lose , Dumptsy . ( The CHERRYS come in . She greets them pleasantly . ) Good evening . MR . CHERRY Good evening , Madame . ( The CHERRYS start to sit , across from IRENE . ) IRENE Bring some more vodka , Dumptsy . Perhaps Mr. and Mrs. Cherry will have some , too . MR . CHERRY Why , thank you  --  we MRS . CHERRY I 'd love to . I 've never tasted vodka . IRENE Ah  --  then it 's high time . Bring in the bottle , Dumptsy . DUMPTSY Yes , Madame . ( He goes in to the bar . ) IRENE Come , sit down here . ( The CHERRYS sits by her . ) You will find vodka a perfect stimulant to the appetite . So much better than that hybrid atrocity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you the truth , Madame  --  we 've already dined . IRENE It is no matter . It is just as good as a liqueur . MRS . CHERRY We did n't really dine at all . We merely looked at the minestrone and the Parmesan cheese  --  and we felt too depressed to eat anything . p. 74 IRENE It 's the altitude . After the first exhilaration there comes a depressive reaction , especially for you , who are accustomed to the heavy , Pigwiggian atmosphere of England . MR . CHERRY Pigwiggian ? IRENE Yes , Pigwig  --  Oliver Twist  --  you know , your Dickens ? ( DUMPTSY enters from bar with a bottle of vodka and two more glasses , which he places on the table . He returns to the bar . ) MR . CHERRY You know England , Madame ? IRENE ( fondly ) Of course I know England ! My governess was a sweet old ogre from your north country  --  and when I was a little girl I used to visit often at Sandringham . MR . CHERRY ( impressed ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was before your time . It was in the reign of dear , gay King Edward , and the beautiful Alexandra . ( She sighs a little for those days . ) I used to have such fun playing with my cousin David . He used to try to teach me to play cricket , and when I could n't swing the bat properly , he said , " Oh , you Russians will never be civilized ! " ( Laughs . ) When I went home to Petersburg I told my uncle , the Tsar , what David had said , and he was so amused ! But now  --  you must drink your vodka . ( They rise , and lift their glasses . ) A toast ! To his most gracious Majesty the King . ( They clink glasses . ) God bless him . p. 75 MR . CHERRY Thank you , Madame . ( All three drink and MRS . CHERRY coughs violently . ) IRENE ( to MRS . CHERRY ) No  --  no ! Drink it right down . Like this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( Refills the glasses from the bottle . ) The second glass will go more easily . ( They sit . ) I used to laugh so at your funny British Tommies in Archangel . They all hated vodka until one of them thought of mixing it with beer . MRS . CHERRY How loathsome ! IRENE It was ! But I shall be forever grateful to them  --  those Tommies . They saved my life when I escaped from the Soviets . For days and nights  --  I do n't know how many  --  I was driving through the snow  --  snow  --  snow  --  snow  --  , in a little sleigh , with the body of my father beside me , and the wolves running along like an escort of dragoons . You know  --  you always think of wolves as howling constantly , do n't you ? MR . CHERRY Why , yes  --  I suppose one does . IRENE Well , they do n't . No , these wolves did n't howl ! They were horribly , confidently silent . I think silence is much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHERRY You must have been dreadfully afraid . IRENE No , I was not afraid for myself . It was the thought of my father . MRS . CHERRY Please ! I know you do n't want to talk about it any more . IRENE Oh , no  --  it is so far away now . But I shall never forget the moment when I came through the haze of delirium , and saw the faces of those Tommies . Those simple , friendly faces . And the snow  --  and the wolves  --  and the terrible cold  --  they were all gone  --  and I was looking at Kew Gardens on a Sunday afternoon , and the sea of golden daffodils  --  " fluttering and dancing in the breezes . " ( WEBER has come in with the daffodils . ) ACHILLE WEBER Shall we go in to dinner now , Irene ? IRENE Yes , yes , Achille . In a minute . I am coming . ( WEBER goes . IRENE rises . ) Now  --  we must finish our vodka . ( CHERRY rises . ) And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CHERRY Thank you so much , Madame . ( They drink . ) IRENE And later on , we must all be here for Mr. Van 's entertainment  --  and we must all applaud vigorously . p. 77 MRS . CHERRY We shall , Madame . MR . CHERRY He 's such a nice chap , is n't he ? IRENE ( going ) Yes  --  and a real artist , too . MR . CHERRY Oh  --  you 've seen him ? IRENE Why  --  yes  --  I 've seen him , in some caf chantant , somewhere . I forget just where it was . ( The three of them have gone out together . The light is dimmed to extinction . The curtain falls . ) END OF SCENE ONE p. 78 Act 2 , Scene 2 SCENE II About two hours later . WEBER is drinking brandy . The CAPTAIN is standing . CAPTAIN LOCICERO I have been listening to the radio . Utter bedlam ! Of course , every government has imposed the strictest censorship  --  but it is very frightening  --  like one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off all the lights . ACHILLE WEBER Any suggestions of air raids ? CAPTAIN LOCICERO None . But there is ominous quiet from Paris . Think of it  --  Paris  --  utterly silent ! Only one station there is sending messages , and they are in code . ACHILLE WEBER Probably instructions to the frontier . CAPTAIN LOCICERO I heard a man in Prague saying something that sounded interesting , but him I could not understand . Then I turned to London , hopefully , and listened to a gentleman describing the disastrous effects of ivy upon that traditional institution , the oak . ACHILLE WEBER Well  --  we shall soon know . There 'll be no trouble about crossing the frontier to-morrow ? CAPTAIN LOCICERO Oh , no . Except that I am still a little worried about madame 's passport . p. 79 ACHILLE WEBER We 'll arrange about that . Have a cigar , Captain ? CAPTAIN LOCICERO Thank you . ( IRENE comes in as the CAPTAIN starts to light the cigar . ) IRENE Do you hear the sound of airplanes ? ( All stop of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAPTAIN shakes out the match , throws the unlit cigar on the table , and dashes to the window and looks upward . ) CAPTAIN LOCICERO It is our bombers . One  --  two  --  three . Seven of them . Seven out of eighteen . You will excuse me ? ( He salutes and dashes out . ) ACHILLE WEBER Seven out of eighteen ! Not bad , for Italians . ( IRENE has gone to the window to look out . ) IRENE I 'm so happy for you , Achille . ACHILLE WEBER What was that , my dear ? IRENE I said  --  I 'm so happy for you . ACHILLE WEBER But  --  just why am I an object of congratulation ? IRENE All this great , wonderful death and destruction , everywhere . And you promoted it ! p. 80 ACHILLE WEBER Do n't give me too much credit , Irene . IRENE But I know what you 've done . ACHILLE WEBER Yes , my dear . You know a great deal . But do n't forget to do honor to Him  --  up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the humble instrument of His divine will . IRENE ( looking upward , sympathetically ) Yes  --  that 's quite true . We do n't do half enough justice to Him . Poor , lonely old soul . Sitting up in heaven , with nothing to do , but play solitaire . Poor , dear God . Playing Idiot 's Delight . The game that never means anything , and never ends . ACHILLE WEBER You have an engaging fancy , my dear . IRENE Yes . ACHILLE WEBER It 's the quality in you that fascinates me most . Limitless imagination ! It is what has made you such an admirable , brilliant liar . And so very helpful to me ! Am I right ? IRENE Of course you are right , Achille . Had I been bound by any stuffy respect for the truth , I should never have escaped from the Soviets . ACHILLE WEBER I 'm sure of it . IRENE Did I ever tell you of my escape from the Soviets ? p. 81 ACHILLE WEBER You have told me about it at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IRENE Well , I made several escapes . I am always making escapes , Achille . When I am worrying about you , and your career . I have to run away from the terror of my own thoughts . So I amuse myself by studying the faces of the people I see . Just ordinary , casual , dull people . ( She is speaking in a tone that is sweetly sadistic . ) That young English couple , for instance . I was watching them during dinner , sitting there , close together , holding hands , and rubbing their knees together under the table . And I saw him in his nice , smart , British uniform , shooting a little pistol at a huge tank . And the tank rolls over him . And his fine strong body , that was so full of the capacity for ecstasy , is a mass of mashed flesh and bones  --  a smear of purple blood  --  like a stepped-on snail . But before the moment of death , he consoles himself by thinking , " Thank God she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he will live to see a better world . " ( She walks behind WEBER and leans over his shoulder . ) But I know where she is . She is lying in a cellar that has been wrecked by an air raid , and her firm young breasts are all mixed up with the bowels of a dismembered policeman , and the embryo from her womb is splattered against the face of a dead bishop . That is the kind of thought with which I amuse myself , Achille . And it makes me so proud to think that I am so close to you  --  who make all this possible . ( WEBER rises and walks about the room . At length he turns to her. ) p. 82 ACHILLE WEBER Do you talk in this whimsical vein to many people ? IRENE No . I betray my thoughts to no one but you . You know that I am shut off from the world . I am a contented prisoner in your ivory tower . ACHILLE WEBER I 'm beginning to wonder about that . IRENE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one else  --   --  ? ACHILLE WEBER No  --  no , my dear . I am merely wondering whether the time has come for you to turn common-place , like all the others ? IRENE The others ? ACHILLE WEBER All those who have shared my life . My former wife , for instance . She now boasts that she abandoned me because part of my income is derived from the sale of poison gas . Revolvers and rifles and bullets she did n't mind  --  because they are also used by sportsmen . Battleships too are permissible ; they look so splendid in the news films . But she could n't stomach poison gas . So now she is married to an anemic Duke , and the large fortune that she obtained from me enables the Duke to indulge his principal passion , which is the slaughtering of wild animals , like rabbits , and pigeons and rather small deer . My wife is presumably happy with him . I have always been glad you are not a fool as she was , Irene . p. 83 IRENE No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall not marry an anemic Duke . ACHILLE WEBER But  --  there was something unpleasantly reminiscent in that gaudy picture you painted . I gather that this silly young couple has touched a tender spot , eh ? IRENE Perhaps , Achille . Perhaps I am softening . ACHILLE WEBER Then apply your intelligence , my dear . Ask yourself : why should n't they die ? And who are the greater criminals  --  those who sell the instruments of death , or those who buy them , and use them ? You know there is no logical reply to that . But all these little people  --  like your new friends  --  all of them consider me an arch-villain because I furnish them with what they want , which is the illusion of power . That is what they vote for in their frightened governments  --  what they cheer for on their national holidays  --  what they glorify in their anthems , and their monuments , and their waving flags ! Yes  --  they shout bravely about something they call " national honor . " And what does it amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Dog in the manger defense of what they 've got , and greed for the other fellow 's possessions ! Honor among thieves ! I assure you , Irene  --  for such little people the deadliest weapons are the most merciful . ( The CHERRYS enter . He is whistling " Minnie the Moocher. " ) p. 84 IRENE Ah ! Mr. and Mrs. Cherry ! MR . CHERRY Hello there . ( They come down . ) IRENE You have dined well ! MRS . CHERRY Superbly ! MR . CHERRY We ate everything  --  up to and including the zabaglione . IRENE You can thank the vodka for that . Vodka never fails in an emergency . MR . CHERRY And we can thank you , Madame , and do so . IRENE But  --  permit me to introduce Monsieur Weber . ( WEBER rises . ) Mrs. Cherry  --  Mr. Cherry . ( They are exchanging greetings as DON comes in . ) DONALD NAVADEL We 're going to have a little cabaret show for you now , Madame . ACHILLE WEBER I do n't think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must  --   --  ACHILLE WEBER I really should look over Lanza 's estimates  --   --  IRENE Please , Achille  --  Mr. Van is an artist . You will be so amused . p. 85 ACHILLE WEBER ( resuming seat ) Very well , Irene . DONALD NAVADEL ( his tone blandly confidential ) Between ourselves , I do n't vouch for the quality of it . But it may be unintentionally amusing . IRENE I shall love it . MR . CHERRY This is the most marvellous idea , Mr. Navadel . DONALD NAVADEL Oh , thank you . We try to contrive some novelty each evening . If you 'll be good enough to sit here  --   --  ( DON goes up to usher in the ROSSIS and direct them to their seats . The musicians come in and take their places . The DOCTOR comes in . DUMPTSY is busily moving chairs about , clearing a space for the act . IRENE and the CHERRYS chat pleasantly . ANNA , the maid , appears on the gallery above to watch the entertainment . ) ( HARRY comes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carries a cane and a straw hat . ) HARRY VAN All set , Don ? DONALD NAVADEL Quite ready , whenever you are . HARRY VAN Okey-doke . Give us a fanfare , professor . ( He goes out . The band obliges with a fanfare . HARRY returns , all smiles . ) Before we start , folks , I just want to explain that we have n't had much chance to rehearse with my good friend , Signor Palota , and his talented little team here . ( He indicates the orchestra with a handsome gesture . ) So we must crave your indulgence and beg you to give us a break if the rhythm is n't all strictly kosher . ( He waits for his laugh . ) All we ask of you , kind friends , is " The Christian pearl of Charity , " to quote our great American poet , John Greenleaf Whittier . We thank you . Take it away ! ( He bows . All applaud . He then sings a song  --  The girls come on in costume and dance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CAPTAIN , the MAJOR , and four flying corps OFFICERS come in . The latter are dirty and in a fever of heroically restrained excitement . They survey the scene with wonderment and then with delight , saying , in Italian , " What 's all this ? " and " What brought these blonde bambinos to Monte Gabriele ? " etc . HARRY interrupts the act and orders the orchestra to play the Fascist anthem , " Giovinezza . " The officers acknowledge this graceful gesture with the Fascist salute . The GIRLS wave back . The CAPTAIN gets the OFFICERS seated and then goes to order drinks . HARRY and the GIRLS resume . ) ( At the end of the act , all applaud and the OFFICERS shout " Brava  --  Bravissima " and stamp their feet with enthusiasm . The GIRLS take several bows and go . HARRY returns for a solo bow , waving his straw hat . One of the OFFICERS shouts , in Italian , " We want the young ladies ! " ) p. 86 CAPTAIN LOCICERO ( to HARRY ) My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care to join them in a little drink ? HARRY VAN Certainly ! Come back in , girls . Get over there and join the army ! ( The GIRLS do so . ) Now , folks  --  with your kind permission  --  I shall give the girls an interlude of rest and refreshment and treat you to a little piano specialty of my own . Your strict attention is not obligatory . ( He starts his specialty , assisted by SHIRLEY and EDNA . The OFFICERS do n't pay much attention . Bottles of champagne are brought for them and the GIRLS . ) ( WEBER goes and speaks to the CAPTAIN . He beckons him up to the landing of the stairs where they converse in low tones , the CAPTAIN telling him about the air-raid . ) ( HARRY 'S act is interrupted by the entrance of QUILLERY . ) QUILLERY ( to HARRY ) Do you know what has happened ? DONALD NAVADEL I told you we did n't want you here . PITTALUGA We 're having an entertainment here . QUILLERY Yes ! An entertainment ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( He and the GIRLS continue with their singing. ) p. 87 QUILLERY An entertainment  --  while Paris is in ruins ! MR . CHERRY ( rises ) What ? DR . WALDERSEE What are you saying ? QUILLERY They have bombed Paris ! The Fascisti have bombed Paris ! DONALD NAVADEL What ? But it ca n't be possible  --   --  HARRY VAN Go on , Shirley . Keep on singing . QUILLERY I tell you  --  to-night their planes flew over and  --   --  MR . CHERRY But how do you know this ? QUILLERY It is on the wireless  --  everywhere . And I have just talked to one of their mechanics , who was on the flight , and saw , with his own eyes  --   --  HARRY VAN Wo n't you please sit down , pal ? We 're trying to give you a little entertainment  --  ( Stops playing . ) QUILLERY For the love of God  --  listen to me ! While you sit here eating and drinking , to-night , Italian planes dropped twenty thousand kilos of bombs on Paris . God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life and beauty is forever destroyed !

It was their planes , from that field down there . Assassins ! ( The OFFICERS make a move toward QUILLERY  --  one of them arming himself with a champagne bottle. ) p. 88 HARRY VAN ( comes down from the piano ) We ca n't have any skull-cracking in this club . Hey , Captain , speak to your men before anything starts . ( The CAPTAIN comes down to the OFFICERS and pacifies them . CHERRY comes down to stand by QUILLERY . ) MRS . CHERRY Jimmy ! You keep out of this ! QUILLERY I say , God damn you ! Assassins ! MAJOR AND FIRST AND THIRD OFFICERS ( jump up ) Assassini ! HARRY VAN Now listen , pal . SHIRLEY Harry !

HARRY VAN Now , for God 's sake stop fluctuating ! QUILLERY England and France are fighting for the hopes of mankind ! p. 89 HARRY VAN A minute ago We stand together forever . ( Turns to OFFICERS . ) I say God damn you . God damn the villains that sent you on this errand of death . CAPTAIN LOCICERO ( takes a few steps toward QUILLERY ) If you do n't close your mouth , Frenchman , we shall be forced to arrest you . QUILLERY Go on , Fascisti ! Commit national suicide . That 's the last gesture left to you toy soldiers . HARRY VAN It 's all right , Captain . Mr. Quillery is for peace . He 's going back to France to stop the war . QUILLERY ( turns on HARRY ) You 're not authorized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I feel . And what I say is " Down with Fascism ! Abbasso Fascismo ! " ( There is an uproar from the OFFICERS . ) CAPTAIN LOCICERO ( ordinarily gentle , is now white hot with rage ) Attenzione ! QUILLERY Vive la France ! Viv  --   --  CAPTAIN LOCICERO E agli arresti. p. 90 QUILLERY Call out the firing squad ! Shoot me dead ! But do not think you can silence the truth that 's in me . CAPTAIN LOCICERO ( grabs QUILLERY from the left and calls the FIRST OFFICER ) Molinari ! ( FIRST OFFICERS grabs QUILLERY from the right . They start to take him out . ) QUILLERY ( as he is being led out ) The Empire of the Fascisti will join the Empire of the Csars in smoking ruins . Vive la France ! Vive la France ! ( WEBER goes upstairs and exits . They have gone . ) MR . CHERRY ( to HARRY ) You 'd better carry on with your turn , old boy . HARRY VAN No , pal . The act is cold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music , Signor . ( The orchestra starts playing . ) Let dancing become general . MR . CHERRY Let 's dance , my sweet . MRS . CHERRY I ca n't bear to , Jimmy . MR . CHERRY I think we should . MRS . CHERRY Very well , darling . ( They dance . The OFFICERS dance with the GIRLS. ) p. 91 HARRY VAN ( goes over to IRENE ) Would you care to dance ? IRENE Why  --  why , thank you . ( She stands up , and they join the slowly moving mob . SHIRLEY is singing as loud as she can . The color wheel turns so that the dancers are bathed in blue , then amber , then red . ) CURTAIN END OF SCENE TWO p. 92 Act 2 , Scene 3 SCENE III Later that night . IRENE and HARRY are alone . She is sitting , telling the story of her life . He is listening with fascination and doubt . IRENE My father was old . The hardships of that terrible journey had broken his body . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He lay there , in that little boat , and he looked up at me . Never can I forget his face , so thin , so white , so beautiful , in the starlight . And he said to me , " Irene  --  little daughter , " and then  --  he died . For four days I was alone , with his body , sailing through the storms of the Black Sea . I had no food  --  no water  --  I was in agony from the bayonet wounds of the Bolsheviki . I knew I must die . But then  --  an American cruiser rescued me . May God bless those good men ! ( She sighs . ) I 've talked too much about myself . What about you , my friend ? HARRY VAN Oh  --  I 'm not very interesting . I 'm just what I seem to be . IRENE C'est impossible ! HARRY VAN C'est possible ! The facts of my case are eloquent . I 'm a potential genius  --  reduced to piloting six blondes through the Balkans . IRENE But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even , I suspect , from yourself . Where did you acquire your superior education ? p. 93 HARRY VAN I worked my way through college selling encyclopdias . IRENE I knew you had culture ! What college was it ? HARRY VAN Oh  --  just any college . But my sales talk was so good that I fell for it myself . I bought the God-damned encyclopdia . And I read it all , travelling around , in day coaches , and depot hotels , and Foxtime dressing rooms . It was worth the money . IRENE And how much of all this have you retained ? HARRY VAN ( significantly ) I ? I  --  never forget anything . IRENE How unfortunate for you ! Does your encyclopdia help you in your dealings with the girls ? HARRY VAN Yes , Mrs. Weber . I got considerable benefit from studying the lives of the great courtesans , and getting to understand their technique . IRENE Forgive me for interrupting you  --  but that is not my name . HARRY VAN Oh  --  pardon me , I thought IRENE I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated in a sort of business way . HARRY VAN I see . p. 94 IRENE He does me the honor to consult me in matters of policy . HARRY VAN That 's quite an honor ! Business is pretty good , is n't it ! IRENE I gather that you are one of those noble souls who does not entirely approve of the munitions industry ? HARRY VAN Oh , no  --  I 'm not noble . Your friend is just another salesman . And I make it a point never to criticize anybody else 's racket . IRENE Monsieur Weber is a very distinguished man . He has rendered very distinguished services to all the governments of the world . He is decorated with the Legion of Honor , the Order of the White Eagle , the Order of St. James of the Sword , and the Military Order of Christ ! HARRY VAN The Military Order of Christ . I never heard of that one . IRENE It is from Portugal . He has many orders . HARRY VAN Have you ever been in America ? IRENE Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , Washington , Palm Beach HARRY VAN I said America . Have you ever been in the West ? IRENE Certainly I have . I flew across your continent . There are many White Russians in California . p. 95 HARRY VAN Did you ever happen to make any parachute landings in any places like Kansas , or Iowa , or Nebraska ? IRENE ( laughing ) I have seen enough of your countrymen to know that you are typical . HARRY VAN Me ? I 'm not typical of anything . IRENE Oh , yes , you are . You are just like all of them  --  an ingenuous , sentimental idealist . You believe in the goodness of human nature , do n't you ? HARRY VAN And what if I do ? I 've known millions of people , intimately  --  and I never found more than one out of a hundred that I did n't like , once you got to know them . IRENE That is very charming  --  but it is nave . HARRY VAN Maybe so . But experience prevents me from working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race as just so many clay pigeons , even if he does belong to the Military Order of Christ . IRENE If you came from an older culture , you would realize that men like Monsieur Weber are necessary to civilization . HARRY VAN You do n't say . IRENE I mean , of course , the sort of civilization that we have got . ( She smiles upon him benevolently . It is as though she were explaining patiently but with secret enjoyment the facts of life to a backward nephew . ) Stupid people consider him an archvillain because it is his duty to stir up a little trouble here and there to stimulate the sale of his products . Do you understand me , my friend ? p. 96 HARRY VAN I should n't wonder . IRENE Monsieur Weber is a true man of the world . He is above petty nationalism ; he can be a Frenchman in France  --  a German in Germany  --  a Greek  --  a Turk  --  whatever the occasion demands . HARRY VAN Yes  --  that little Quillery was an Internationalist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got a whiff of gunpowder he began to spout hate and revenge . And now those nice , polite Wops will probably have to shut him up with a firing squad . IRENE ( takes out a cigarette from her case ) It is a painful necessity . HARRY VAN And it demonstrates the sort of little trouble that your friend stirs up . ( He takes out his lighter and lights her cigarette . ) IRENE Do you know that you can be extremely rude ? HARRY VAN I 'm sorry if I 've hurt your feelings about Mr. Weber , but he just happens to be a specimen of the one per cent that I do n't like . IRENE I was not referring to that . Why do you stare at me so ? HARRY VAN Have I been staring ? p. 97 IRENE Steadily . Ever since we arrived here this afternoon . Why do you do it ? HARRY VAN I 've been thinking I could notice a funny resemblance to some one I used to know . IRENE You should know better than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of us like to think that our appearance is commonplace . HARRY VAN The one you look like was n't commonplace . IRENE Oh ! She was some one near and dear to you ? HARRY VAN It was somebody that occupies a unique shrine in the temple of my memory . IRENE That is a glowing tribute . The Temple of your memory must be so crowded ! But I am keeping you from your duties . HARRY VAN What duties ? IRENE Should n't you be worrying about your young ladies ? HARRY VAN They 're all right ; they 've gone to bed . IRENE Yes  --  but there are several Italian officers about . Are n't you supposed to be the chaperone ? HARRY VAN I leave the girls to their own resources , of which they have plenty . ( He stares hard at her . ) Have you always been a blonde ? p. 98 IRENE Yes  --  as far as I can remember . HARRY VAN You do n't mind my asking ? IRENE Not at all . And now , may I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IRENE Why do you waste yourself in this degraded work ? Touring about with those obvious little harlots ? HARRY VAN You mean you think I 'm fitted for something that requires a little more mentality ? IRENE Yes . HARRY VAN How do you know so much about me ? ( It should be remembered that all through this scene HARRY is studying her , trying to fit together the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle of his memory . ) IRENE For one thing , I saw your performance to-night . HARRY VAN You thought it was punk ? IRENE I thought it was unworthy . HARRY VAN It was unfortunately interrupted . You should have seen IRENE I saw enough . You are a very bad dancer . HARRY VAN The King of Rumania thought I was pretty good . p. 99 IRENE He is entitled to his opinion  --  and I to mine . HARRY VAN I 'll admit that I 've done better things in my time . Would it surprise you to know that I was once with a mind-reading act ? IRENE Really ? HARRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . HARRY VAN Have you ever been in Omaha ? IRENE Omaha ? Where is that ? Persia ? HARRY VAN No . Nebraska . That 's one of our states . I played there once with the greatest act of my career . I was a stooge for Zuleika , the Mind Reader . At least she called me her stooge . But I was the one who had to do all the brain work . IRENE And she read people 's minds ? HARRY VAN I did it for her . I passed through the audience and fed her the cues . We were sensational , playing the finest picture houses in all the key cities . Zuleika sat up on the stage , blindfolded  --  and usually blind drunk . IRENE Oh , dear . And was she the one that I resemble ? HARRY VAN No ! There was another act on the same bill . A troupe of Russians p. 100 IRENE Russians ? HARRY VAN Singers , mandolin players , and squat dancers . One of them was a red-headed girl . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to teach her the code . She said she could do it better than Zuleika . IRENE Those poor Russians . There are so many of them all over the world . And so many of them completely counterfeit ! HARRY VAN This dame was counterfeit all right . In fact , she was the God-damnedest liar I ever saw . She lied just for the sheer artistry of it . She kept after me so much that I told her finally to come up to my hotel room one night , and we 'd talk it over . IRENE I hope you did n't tell her the code . HARRY VAN No . After the week in Omaha the bill split . The Russians went to Sioux Falls and we went on the Interstate Time . I played with Zuleika for another year and then the drink got her and she could n't retain . So the act busted up . I 've always hoped I 'd catch up with that red-headed Russian again sometime . She might have been good . She had the voice for it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a characteristic Gypsy quality . And you never saw her again ? HARRY VAN No. p. 101 IRENE Perhaps it is just as well . She could n't have been so clever  --  being duped so easily into going to your room . HARRY VAN She was n't being duped ! She knew what she was doing . If there was any duping going on , she was the one that did it . IRENE She did make an impression ! HARRY VAN ( looking straight at her ) I was crazy about her . She was womanhood at its most desirable  --  and most unreliable . IRENE And you such a connoisseur . But  --  it 's getting late . HARRY VAN ( rises ) Do you know any Russian music ? ( He crosses to the piano . ) IRENE ( rises ) Oh , yes . When I was a little girl my father used to engage Chaliapin to come often to our house . He taught me many songs . HARRY VAN Chaliapin , eh ? Your father spared no expense . ( He sits at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( He plays a few bars of " Kak Stranna . " ) Kak Stranna ! HARRY VAN Yeah ! How strange ! ( He starts to play " Prostchai . " ) Do you know this one ? ( IRENE sings some of it in Russian . ) How do you spell that name  --  Irene ? p. 102 IRENE I-R-E-N-E . ( HARRY pounds the piano and jumps up . ) What 's the matter ? HARRY VAN That 's it ! Irene ! ( He pronounces it I-REEN . ) IRENE But what  --   --  ? HARRY VAN I knew it ! You 're the one ! IRENE What one ? HARRY VAN That red-headed liar ! Irene ! I knew I could never be mistaken . IRENE Irene is a very usual name in Russia . ( She laughs heartily . ) HARRY VAN I do n't care how usual it is . Everything fits together perfectly now . The name  --  the face  --  the voice  --  Chaliapin for a teacher ! Certainly it 's you ! And it 's no good shaking your head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you ca n't deny the fact that you slept with me in the Governor Bryan Hotel in Omaha in the fall of 1925 . ( IRENE laughs heartily again . ) All right  --  go ahead and laugh . That blonde hair had me fooled for a while  --  but now I know it 's just as phoney as the bayonet wounds , and the parachute jumps into the jungle . IRENE ( still laughing ) Oh  --  you amuse me. p. 103 HARRY VAN It 's a pleasure to be entertaining . But you ca n't get away with it . IRENE You amuse me very much indeed . Here we are  --  on a mountain peak in Bedlam . To-night , the Italians are bombing Paris . At this moment , the French may be bombing Rome , and the English bombing Germany  --  and the Soviets bombing Tokyo , and all you worry about is whether I am a girl you once met casually in Omaha . HARRY VAN Did I say it was casual ? IRENE ( laughing ) Oh  --  it is amusing ! HARRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I admit it 's all very funny . I 've admitted everything . I told you I was crazy about you . Now when are you going to give me a break and tell me  --   --  IRENE You ! You are so troubled  --  so  --  so uncertain about everything . HARRY VAN I 'm not uncertain about it any more , Babe . I had you tagged from the start . There was something about you that was indelible something I could n't forget all these years . ( WEBER appears on the gallery , wearing his Sulka dressing gown . ) ACHILLE WEBER Forgive me for intruding , my dear . But I suggest that it 's time for you to go to bed . p. 104 IRENE Yes , Achille . At once . ( WEBER treats HARRY to a rather disparaging glance and exits . IRENE starts upstairs . ) Poor Achille ! He suffers with the most dreadful insomnia  --  it is something on his mind . ( She goes up a few more steps . ) He is like Macbeth . Good night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . IRENE And thank you for making me laugh so much  --  to-night . HARRY VAN I could still teach you that code . IRENE Perhaps  --  we shall meet again in  --  what was the name of the hotel ? HARRY VAN It was the Governor Bryan . IRENE Oh , yes ! The Governor Bryan ! ( Laughing heartily , she exits . HARRY goes to the piano , sits down and starts to play " Kak Stranna . " DUMPTSY enters from the bar . ) DUMPTSY That was wonderful  --  that singing and dancing . HARRY VAN ( still playing ) Thanks , pal . Glad you enjoyed it . DUMPTSY Oh , yes , Mr. Van  --  that was good . p. 105 HARRY VAN ( bangs a chord ) Chaliapin  --  for God 's sake ! DUMPTSY I beg your pardon , sir ? HARRY VAN ( rises ) It 's nothing . Good night , Dumptsy . ( He goes out into the lobby . ) DUMPTSY Good night , sir . ( He starts for the bar. ) @x The following afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Caprice Viennoise , " or something similar . His thoughts are elsewhere . SHIRLEY is darning some stockings and humming the tune . BEBE is plucking her eyebrows . BEULAH , ELAINE , FRANCINE and EDNA are seated at a table . BEULAH is telling ELAINE 'S fortune with cards . The others are watching . All are intensely serious , and all chewing gum . SHIRLEY What 's that number , Harry ? HARRY VAN The " Caprice Viennoise "  --  Kreisler . SHIRLEY It 's pretty . HARRY VAN You think so ? ( He shifts to something jazzier . ) BEULAH You are going to marry . ELAINE Again ? BEULAH The cards indicate distinctly two marriages , and maybe a third . ELAINE ( chewing furiously ) For God 's sake ! SHIRLEY ( to HARRY ) We certainly need some new stockings . p. 107 HARRY VAN We 'll renovate the wardrobe in Geneva . BEULAH Now  --  let 's see what the fates tell us next . BEBE Say , Harry  --  when do we lam it out of here ? HARRY VAN Ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards . BEBE I hate this place . It 's spooky . BEULAH ( to HARRY ) What 'd you say , honey ? ELAINE Ah  --  do n't pay any attention to him . What else do they say about me ? BEULAH Well you 'll enter upon a period of very poor health . ELAINE When ? BEULAH Along about your thirty-seventh year . SHIRLEY That means any day now . ( She winks broadly at BEBE , who laughs . ) HARRY VAN ( vehemently ) Listen to me , you nymphs ! We ca n't be wasting our time with card tricks . We 've got to do a little rehearsing . SHIRLEY Why , Harry  --  what are you mad about now ? HARRY VAN Who said I was mad about anything ? p. 108 SHIRLEY Well  --  every time you get yourself into a peeve , you take it out on us . You start in hollering , " Listen , girls  --  we got to rehearse . " HARRY VAN I am not peeved . Merely a little disgusted . The act needs brushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we know the routine by now ? HARRY VAN I 'm not saying you do n't know it . I 'm just saying that your performance last night grieved me and shocked me . You had your eyes on those officers and not on your work . That kind of attitude went big in Rumania , but now we 're going to a town where artistry counts . Some day , I 'll take the whole bunch of you to watch the Russian ballet , just to give you an idea of what dancing is . ( CAPTAIN LOCICERO comes in . ) CAPTAIN LOCICERO Your pardon , Mr. Van . HARRY VAN Ah , Captain . Good afternoon . Rest , girls . CAPTAIN LOCICERO ( to the GIRLS ) Good afternoon . GIRLS Good afternoon , Captain . HARRY VAN You bring us news ? CAPTAIN LOCICERO Good news , I hope . May I have your passports ? p. 109 HARRY VAN Certainly . ( He gets them out of his coat and hands them to the CAPTAIN . ) CAPTAIN LOCICERO Thank you . I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He salutes and starts to go . ) HARRY VAN What about Mr. Quillery , Captain ? What 's happened to him ? CAPTAIN LOCICERO Mr. Quillery was very injudicious . Very injudicious . I am glad that you are so much more intelligent . ( He goes out . ) SHIRLEY I do n't think they could have done anything cruel to him . They 're awfully sweet boys , those Wops . HARRY VAN So I observed . Now listen to me , girls . Geneva 's a key spot , and we 've got to be good . Your audiences there wo n't be a lot of hunkies , who do n't care what you do as long as you do n't wear practically any pants . These people are accustomed to the best . They 're mains  --  big people , like prime ministers , and maharajahs and archbishops . If we click with them , we 'll be set for London and Paris . We may even make enough money to get us home . BEBE Oh  --  do n't speak of such a thing ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ! p. 110 HARRY VAN The trouble with all of you is , you 're thinking too much about your own specialties . You 're trying to steal the act , and wreck it . Remember what the late Knute Rockne said : " Somebody else can have the all-star , all-American aggregations . All I want is a team ! " Now , you  --  Beulah . You 've got plenty of chance to score individually in the bubble number . But when we 're doing the chorus routine , you 've got to submerge your genius in the mass . BEULAH What do I do wrong , honey ? HARRY VAN Your Maxie Ford is lacklustre . Here  --  I 'll show you . ( HARRY gets up to demonstrate the Maxie Ford . ) SHIRLEY ( laughs ) If you do it that way , Beulah , you 'll go flat on your face . Here  --  I 'll show you . HARRY VAN Just a minute , Miss Laughlin . Who 's the director of this act , you or me ? SHIRLEY ( amiably ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know the steps . ELAINE Do n't let her get fresh , Harry . BEBE Slap her down ! SHIRLEY Give us the music , Harry . p. 111 BEULAH Please , Harry . Shirley just wants to be helpful . HARRY VAN I feel I should resent this  --  but  --  ( He returns to the piano . ) Go ahead , Miss Laughlin . Carry on . ( He plays . SHIRLEY demonstrates . BEULAH tries it . ) BEULAH Have I got it right ? SHIRLEY Sure ! He 's just shooting his face off ! ( During this , the following conversation goes on : ) ELAINE You know that Wop that was giving me a play last night ? FRANCINE You mean the one with the bent nose ? BEBE I thought he was terrible . But that boy I had is a Count . ELAINE Well , look what he gave me . EDNA What is it ? BEBE Let me see it . ELAINE I do n't know what it is . BEBE Looks like money . What kind of money is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman coin . SHIRLEY How much is it worth ? p. 112 HARRY VAN I have n't looked up the latest rate of exchange on dinars . But I think , dear , you 've been betrayed . Now , pay attention , girls . As I said , we 've got to improve the act , and with that in view , I 'm going to retire from all the dance routine . BEBE What ? BEULAH Why , Harry  --  we could n't . SHIRLEY Oh ! I hurt you , did n't I ! ( She rushes to him , coos over him . ) Yes , I did , you poor baby . I hurt his feelings  --  and I 'm sorry  --  I 'm very , very sorry . HARRY VAN All right , Shirley . We can dispense with the regrets . Save your lipstick . ( He thrusts her away . ) SHIRLEY But why ? HARRY VAN I 've decided that I 'm a thinker , rather than a performer . From now on , I shall devote myself to the purely creative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the negotiation of contracts . BEULAH But when did you make up your mind to this , honey ? HARRY VAN I 've been considering it for a long time . SHIRLEY Say ! What were you talking about to that Russian dame ? p. 113 HARRY VAN We discussed world politics . FRANCINE Oh ! SHIRLEY And how are politics these days ? BEBE Did you get anywheres near to first base , Harry ? HARRY VAN I find it impossible to explain certain things to you girls . You 're children of nature . SHIRLEY We 're what ? BEULAH He means we 're natural . HARRY VAN Never mind , sweetheart . You 'll sing the number , Shirley . SHIRLEY Me ? BEBE With that terrible voice ? HARRY VAN She handled it fine that time I had bronchitis in Belgrade . And with a little rehearsal , you 'll have the whole League of Nations rooting for you . Now  --  let 's have it . ( He plays , SHIRLEY sings , BEBE disapproves . ) ( DON comes in , dressed for travelling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let us through and the train is due to leave about four o'clock . What a relief to be out of this foul place ! HARRY VAN You going too , Don ? p. 114 DONALD NAVADEL Yes . There 's nothing for me here . In fact , I 'm sick and tired of Europe as a whole . I was in town this morning when they shot Quillery . BEBE Who ? SHIRLEY It was that little guy that bawled out the Wops . BEULAH They shot him ? Why did they have to do that ? DONALD NAVADEL Of course , he asked for it . But even so , it 's pretty sickening to see one of your fellow human beings crumpled up in horrible , violent death . Well  --  there 'll be plenty more like him , and right here , too . The French know all about this air base , and they 'll be over any minute with their bombs . So  --  it 's California here I come ! HARRY VAN And run right into the Japs ! Better stop off at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the train . ( He goes up the stairs . ) HARRY VAN You girls go get yourselves ready . ( The CHERRYS appear on the gallery . DON speaks to them , then goes out . The CHERRYS come down . ) ELAINE O.K. , Harry . EDNA ( going ) I 'm surprised at those Wops . They seemed like such sweet boys . p. 115 BEBE Sure  --  when they talk they sound like opera . But they 're awful excitable . ( BEBE , ELAINE , EDNA and FRANCINE have gone out . ) BEULAH But I ca n't understand  --  why did they have to shoot that poor boy ? HARRY VAN It 's hard to explain , Beulah . But it seems there 's some kind of argument going on over here , and the only way they can settle it is by murdering a lot of people . BEBE You do n't need to tell me what it 's like . I was in the Club Grotto the night the Purple Gang shot it out with the G 's . And was that terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and BEULAH have gone out . ) HARRY VAN You heard what they did to Quillery ? MR . CHERRY Yes . It seems that he died like a true patriot , shouting " Vive La France . " HARRY VAN Better if he died like a man  --  sticking to what he knew was right . MR . CHERRY He was a nice little chap . MRS . CHERRY The Italians are swine ! ( DON reappears on the balcony and comes down . ) MR . CHERRY Oh , they had a perfect right to do it . p. 116 MRS . CHERRY But to kill a man for saying what he thinks ! MR . CHERRY Many people will be killed for less than that . HARRY VAN I 'll have to be saying good-bye pretty soon . Did you say the train goes at four , Don ? DONALD NAVADEL Four o'clock . Correct ! ( He goes . ) HARRY VAN I hope all this unpleasantness wo n't spoil your winter sports . MR . CHERRY Oh , that 's all washed up . We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the border . HARRY VAN So the honeymoon has ended already ? MRS . CHERRY Yes  --  I suppose so . MR . CHERRY England is coming into this business . We have to stand by France , of course . And so there 's nothing for it but MRS . CHERRY And so Jimmy will have to do his bit , manning the guns , for civilization . Perhaps he 'll join in the bombardment of Florence , where we were married . MR . CHERRY You know  --  after the ceremony we went into the Baptistery and prayed to the soul of Leonardo da Vinci that we might never fail in our devotion to that which is beautiful and true . I told you we were a bit on the romantic side . We forgot what Leonardo said about war . Bestial frenzy , he called it . And bestial frenzy it is. p. 117 MRS . CHERRY But we must n't think about that now . We have to stand by France . We have to make the world a decent place for heroes to live in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHERRY rushes to her . ) MR . CHERRY Now , now , darling . We 've got to make a pretense of being sporting about it . Please , darling . Do n't cry . HARRY VAN Let her cry , the poor kid . Let her sob her heart out  --  for all the God-damned good it will do her . You know what I often think ? ( He is trying to be tactful . ) I often think we ought to get together and elect somebody else God . Me , for instance . I 'll bet I 'd do a much better job . MRS . CHERRY You 'd be fine , Mr. Van . HARRY VAN I believe I would . There 'd be a lot of people who would object to my methods . That Mr. Weber , for instance . I 'd certainly begin my administration by beating the can off him . MR . CHERRY Let 's start the campaign now ! Vote for good old Harry Van , and his Six Angels ! ( The CAPTAIN comes in with a brief-case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and puts them on a table . ) CAPTAIN LOCICERO Good afternoon , Mrs. Cherry . Gentlemen . p. 118 HARRY VAN Do we get across ? CAPTAIN LOCICERO Here is your passport , Mr. Van  --  and the young ladies , with my compliments . They have been duly stamped . ( He hands them over . ) HARRY VAN Thanks , Captain . And how about Mr. Weber and his  --  friend ? Are they going , too ? CAPTAIN LOCICERO I have their passports here . I advise you to make ready , Mr. Van . The train will leave in about forty-five minutes . HARRY VAN O.K. , Captain . See you later , Mr. and Mrs. Cherry . ( He goes . ) MR . CHERRY O.K. , Harry . MRS . CHERRY And what about us , Captain ? CAPTAIN LOCICERO Due to a slight technicality , you will be permitted to cross the frontier . Here are your passports . MR . CHERRY I ca n't tell you how grateful we are . ( WEBER appears on the gallery . ) CAPTAIN LOCICERO You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fact that you are allowed to pass is due to the superb centralization of authority in my country . The telegram authorizing your release was filed at 11:43 to-day , just seventeen minutes before a state of war was declared between Great Britain and Italy . I must obey the order of Rome , even though I know it 's out of date . Is your luggage ready ? p. 119 MR . CHERRY It 's all out here in the hall . We 're off now , Captain . Well , good-bye and good luck ! CAPTAIN LOCICERO And good luck to you  --  both of you . MR . CHERRY I need hardly say that I 'm sorry about all this . It 's really a damned rotten shame . CAPTAIN LOCICERO It is . All of that . Good-bye , my friend . ( He extends his hand and CHERRY shakes it . ) Madame . ( He extends his hand to MRS . CHERRY . ) MRS . CHERRY Do n't call me your friend , because I say what Quillery said  --  damn you  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this horror . CAPTAIN LOCICERO ( bows ) It is not my fault , Mrs. Cherry . MR . CHERRY It 's utterly unfair to talk that way , darling . The Captain is doing his miserable duty as decently as he possibly can . CAPTAIN LOCICERO ( tactfully ) In this unhappy situation , we are all in danger of losing our heads . MRS . CHERRY I know I know . Forgive me for the outburst . ( She extends her hand to the CAPTAIN and they shake . ) I should have remembered that it 's everybody 's fault . p. 120 MR . CHERRY That 's right , my sweet . Come along . ( They go out . ) CAPTAIN LOCICERO ( to WEBER ) Frankly , my heart bleeds for them . ACHILLE WEBER They 're young . They 'll live through it , and be happy . CAPTAIN LOCICERO Will they ? I was their age , and in their situation , twenty years ago , when I was sent to the Isonzo front . And people said just that to me : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survive and come to triumph . " And I believed it . That is why I could n't say such deceiving words to them now . ACHILLE WEBER The cultivation of hope never does any immediate harm . Is everything in order ? CAPTAIN LOCICERO ( rises ) Quite , Monsieur Weber . Here it is . ( He hands over WEBER 'S passport . ) ACHILLE WEBER And Madame 's ? ( The CAPTAIN picks up a document on foolscap . ) CAPTAIN LOCICERO This is an unusual kind of passport . It has given us some worry . ACHILLE WEBER The League of Nations issues documents like that to those whose nationality is uncertain . p. 121 CAPTAIN LOCICERO I understand  --  but the attitude of Italy toward the League of Nations is not at the moment cordial . ACHILLE WEBER Then you refuse to honor Madame 's passport ? CAPTAIN LOCICERO My instructions are to accord you every consideration , Monsieur Weber . In view of the fact that Madame is travelling with you , I shall be glad to approve her visa . ACHILLE WEBER Madame is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CAPTAIN LOCICERO But it is understood that you vouch for her , and that is enough to satisfy the authorities . ACHILLE WEBER ( with cold authority ) Vouch for her ? It is not necessary for anyone to vouch for Madame ! She is entirely capable of taking care of herself . If her passport is not entirely in order , it is no affair of mine . CAPTAIN LOCICERO ( genuinely distressed ) But  --  I must tell you , Monsieur Weber  --  this is something I do not like . This places me in a most embarrassing position . I shall be forced to detain her . ACHILLE WEBER You are a soldier , my dear Captain , and you should be used to embarrassing positions . Undoubtedly you were embarrassed this morning , when you had to shoot that confused pacifist , Quillery . But this is war , and unpleasant responsibilities descend upon you and on me as well . However ( He sees HARRY , who is coming in . ) I shall attend to my luggage . Thank you , Captain . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention it . ( To HARRY . ) The young ladies are ready ? HARRY VAN Yes  --  they 're ready . And some of your aviators are out there trying to talk them into staying here permanently . CAPTAIN LOCICERO ( smiling ) And I add my entreaties to theirs . HARRY VAN We wo n't have any more trouble , will we ? ( The DOCTOR appears on the gallery with coat , hat , books done in a bundle , and umbrella . He comes downstairs . ) CAPTAIN LOCICERO Oh , no , Mr. Van . Geneva is a lovely spot . All of Switzerland is beautiful , these days . I envy you going there , in such charming company . HARRY VAN Hi , Doctor . Have you got the rats all packed ? DR . WALDERSEE Good afternoon . I am privileged to go now ? ( He puts down all of his belongings and crosses . ) CAPTAIN LOCICERO Yes , Dr. Waldersee . Here is your passport . DR . WALDERSEE Thank you . ( He examines the passport carefully . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to be proud to have known you . When I read in the papers that you 've wiped out cancer and won the Nobel prize , and you 're the greatest hero on earth , I 'll be able to say , " He 's a personal friend of mine . He once admired my music . " p. 123 DR . WALDERSEE ( solemnly ) Thank you very much . ( To the CAPTAIN . ) This visa is good for crossing the Austrian border ? CAPTAIN LOCICERO Certainly . But you are going to Zurich ? DR . WALDERSEE ( rises ) I have changed my plans . I am going back into Germany . Germany is at war . Perhaps I am needed . ( He crosses to pick up his coat . ) HARRY VAN Needed for what ? DR . WALDERSEE I shall offer my services for what they are worth . ( HARRY goes to help him on with his coat . ) HARRY VAN But what about the rats ? DR . WALDERSEE ( fiercely ) Why should I save people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can go out and exterminate each other ? Obscene maniacs ! ( Starts to put on his gloves . ) Then I 'll be a maniac , too . Only I 'll be more dangerous than most of them . For I know all the tricks of death ! And  --  as for my rats , maybe they 'll be useful . Britain will put down the blockade again , and we shall be starving  --  and maybe I 'll cut my rats into filets and eat them . ( He laughs , not pleasantly , and picks up his umbrella and books. ) p. 124 HARRY VAN Wait a minute , Doctor . You 're doing this without thinking . DR . WALDERSEE I 'm thinking probably that remedy you sold is better than mine . Hasten to apply it . We are all diseased . HARRY VAN But you ca n't change around like this ! Have you forgotten all the things you told me ? All that about backsliding ? DR . WALDERSEE No , I have not forgotten the degradation of mankind  --  that is painful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I am sorry to disappoint you about the Nobel prize . ( He has gone . ) HARRY VAN Good-bye , Doctor . ( He sits down , wearily . ) Why in the name of God ca n't somebody answer the question that everybody asks ? Why ? Why ? Oh  --  I know the obvious answers , but they are n't good enough . Weber  --  and a million like him  --  they ca n't take the credit for all of this ! Who is it that did this dirty trick on a lot of decent people ? And why do you let them get away with it ? That 's the thing that I 'd like to know ! CAPTAIN LOCICERO We have avalanches up here , my friend . They are disastrous . They start with a little crack in the ice , so tiny that one can not see it , until , suddenly , it bursts wide open . And then it is too late . p. 125 HARRY VAN That 's very effective , Captain . But it do n't satisfy me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's made out of flesh and blood  --  and  --  and brains . It 's God-damned bad management  --  that 's what it is ! ( This last is half to himself . ) ( IRENE has appeared on the gallery and started to come down . ) IRENE Still upset about the situation , Mr. Van ? Ah  --  good afternoon , my dear Captain Locicero . CAPTAIN LOCICERO Good afternoon , Madame . IRENE I have had the most superb rest here . The atmosphere is so calm , and impersonal , and soothing . I ca n't bear to think that we 're going to Biarritz , with the dull , dismal old sea pounding in my ears . ( WEBER comes in . ) IRENE We are leaving now , Achille ? ACHILLE WEBER I believe that some difficulties have arisen . ( He looks toward the CAPTAIN . ) IRENE Difficulties ? CAPTAIN LOCICERO I regret , Madame , that there must be some further delay . IRENE Oh ! Then the train is not going through , after all ? p. 126 CAPTAIN LOCICERO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of yours presents problems which , under the circumstances  --   --  IRENE Monsieur Weber will settle the problems , whatever they are . Wo n't you , Achille ? ACHILLE WEBER There is some question about your nationality , Irene . CAPTAIN LOCICERO ( referring to the passport ) It states here , Madame , that your birthplace is uncertain , but assumed to be Armenia . IRENE That is a province of Russia ! CAPTAIN LOCICERO You subsequently became a resident of England , then of the United States , and then of France . IRENE ( angrily ) Yes  --  it 's all there  --  clearly stated . I have never before had the slightest difficulty about my passport . It was issued by the League of Nations . ACHILLE WEBER I 'm afraid the standing of the League of Nations is not very high in Italy at this moment . CAPTAIN LOCICERO The fact is , Madame , the very existence of the League is no longer recognized by our government . For that reason , we can not permit you to cross the frontier at this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The CAPTAIN hands her the passport . ) I 'm sure you will appreciate the delicacy of my position . Perhaps we shall be able to adjust the matter to-morrow . ( He salutes and goes out , glad to escape . HARRY goes with him , asking " What 's the trouble , Captain ? Ca n't something be done about it ? " ) p. 127 ACHILLE WEBER I should of course wait over , Irene . But you know how dangerous it is for me to delay my return to France by so much as one day . I have been in touch with our agents . The premier is demanding that production be doubled  --  trebled  --  at once . IRENE Of course . ACHILLE WEBER Here  --  ( He takes out an envelope containing money . ) This will cover all possible expenses . ( He gives her the envelope . ) There is a train for Venice this evening . You must go there and see Lanza . I have already sent him full instructions . IRENE Yes , Achille . And I thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ACHILLE WEBER ( smiles ) You are a genuinely superior person , my dear . It is a privilege to have known you . IRENE Thank you again , Achille . Good-bye . ACHILLE WEBER Good-bye , Irene . ( He kisses her hand . HARRY returns . ) Coming , Mr. Van ? HARRY VAN In a minute . ( WEBER goes . IRENE puts the money in her handbag . ) Tough luck , babe . IRENE It 's no matter . p. 128 HARRY VAN I just talked to the Captain and he is n't going to be as brutal as the Bolsheviks were . I mean , you wo n't suffer any bayonet wounds . He 'll fix it for you to get through to-morrow . IRENE You want to be encouraging , my dear friend . But it 's no use . The Italian government has too many reasons for wishing to detain me . They 'll see to it that I disappear  --  quietly  --  and completely . HARRY VAN Yes  --  I know all about that . IRENE All about what ? HARRY VAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were . ( SHIRLEY appears at the left . ) SHIRLEY Hey , Harry ! It 's time for us to go . HARRY VAN I 'll be right out . ( SHIRLEY goes . ) IRENE Go away  --  go away with your friends . If I am to die , it is no concern of yours ! HARRY VAN Listen , babe  --  I have n't any wish to IRENE ( flaming ) And please do n't call me babe ! ( She stands up and walks away from him . He follows her. ) p. 129 HARRY VAN My apologies , Madame . I just call everybody " babe . " IRENE Perhaps that 's why I do not like it ! HARRY VAN Even if I do n't believe anything you say , I can see pretty plainly that you 're in a tough spot . And considering what we were to each other in the old Governor Bryan Hotel  --   --  IRENE Must you always be in Omaha ? HARRY VAN I 'd like to help you , Irene . Is n't there something I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I thank you , for that offer . But it 's useless . HARRY VAN You do n't have to thank me . Tell me  --  what can I do ? IRENE You 're very kind , and very gallant . But , unfortunately , you 're no match for Achille Weber . He has decided that I shall remain here and his decision is final ! HARRY VAN Is he responsible for them stopping you ? IRENE Of course he is . I knew it the moment I saw that ashamed look on Captain Locicero 's face , when he refused to permit me HARRY VAN So Weber double-crossed you , did he ! What has the son of a bitch got against you ? p. 130 IRENE He 's afraid of me . I know too much about his methods of promoting his own business . HARRY VAN Everybody knows about his methods . Little Quillery was talking about them last night . IRENE Yes  --  and what happened to Quillery ? That 's what happens to every one who dares to criticize him . Last night I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him the truth ! At last I told him just what I think . And now  --  you see how quickly he strikes back ! ( SHIRLEY and BEBE appear . ) SHIRLEY Harry ! The bus is going to leave . HARRY VAN All right  --  all right ! BEBE But we got to go this minute ! HARRY VAN I 'll be with you . Get out ! SHIRLEY ( as they go ) Can you imagine ? He stops everything to make another pass at that Russian . ( They have gone . ) IRENE Go ahead  --  go ahead ! You ca n't help me ! No one can ! ( He picks up his coat and hat . ) But  --  if it will make you any happier in your future travels with Les Blondes , I 'll tell you , yes  --  I did know you , slightly , in Omaha ! p. 131 HARRY VAN ( peering at her ) Are you lying again ? IRENE It was Room 974 . Does that convince you ? HARRY VAN ( ferociously ) How can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Well , then  --  you 'll never be sure , Mr. Van . BEBE 'S VOICE Harry ! SHIRLEY 'S VOICE For God 's sake , Harry ! DONALD NAVADEL ( appearing ) We ca n't wait another instant ! ( DON goes . ) SHIRLEY 'S VOICE Come on ! HARRY VAN ( He turns and starts for the door , addressing the GIRLS en route . ) All right , God damn it ! ( He goes out . ) ( IRENE takes out her vanity case , and does something to her face . She takes off her hat and cloak . DUMPTSY comes in from the back . He is wearing the uniform of a private in the Italian army , with gas mask at the alert , and a full pack on his back . ) DUMPTSY Good afternoon , Madame . IRENE ( turning ) Why , Dumptsy  --  what is that costume ? p. 132 DUMPTSY They called me up . Look ! I 'm an Italian soldier . IRENE You look splendid ! DUMPTSY If you please , Madame . But why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've decided to stay and enjoy the winter sports . DUMPTSY I do n't think this is a good place any more , Madame . They say the war is very big  --  bigger than last time . IRENE Yes  --  I hear that on all sides . DUMPTSY The French will be here to drop bombs on everybody . IRENE It will be thrilling for us if they do . Wo n't it , Dumptsy ? DUMPTSY Maybe it will , Madame . But  --  I came to say good-bye to Auguste , the barman , and Anna , the maid . They 're both cousins of mine . They 'll laugh when they see me in these clothes . ( He goes to the left . ) Can I get you anything , Madame ? IRENE Yes , Dumptsy . I 'll have a bottle of champagne . Bring two glasses . We 'll have a drink together . DUMPTSY If you please , Madame . ( DUMPTSY goes into the bar . IRENE lights a cigarette and goes up to the window to look out . PITTALUGA comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall , Madame . Will you wish it taken to the same suite ? IRENE No  --  I did n't really care much for those rooms . Have you anything smaller ? PITTALUGA ( in a less deferential tone ) We have smaller rooms on the other side of the hotel . IRENE I 'll have the smallest . It will be cozier . PITTALUGA You wish to go to it now ? IRENE No . You can send up the luggage . I 'll look at it later . ( PITTALUGA bows and goes . DUMPTSY returns with the champagne . ) DUMPTSY I was right , Madame . Auguste laughed very much . IRENE ( coming down ) What will happen to your wife and children , Dumptsy ? DUMPTSY Oh  --  I suppose the Fascisti will feed them . They promised to feed all the families with a man who is out fighting for their country . ( He has filled her glass . She sits down . ) IRENE Go ahead and pour yourself one , Dumptsy . DUMPTSY Thank you so much , Madame . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here 's to you , Dumptsy  --  and to Austria . DUMPTSY And to you , Madame , if you please . IRENE Thank you . ( They drink . ) DUMPTSY And may you soon be restored to your home in Petersburg . IRENE Petersburg ? DUMPTSY Yes , Madame . Your home . IRENE ( with a slight smile ) Ah , yes . My home ! ( They drink again . ) And have no fear for the future , Dumptsy . Whatever happens  --  have no fear ! DUMPTSY If you please , Madame . ( He finishes his drink . ) And now I must go find Anna , if you will excuse me . IRENE Here , Dumptsy . ( She hands him a note of money . ) Good-bye , and God bless you . DUMPTSY Thank you so much , Madame . ( DUMPTSY leans over and kisses her hand . ) Kiss die hand , Madame . ( The CAPTAIN and MAJOR come in from the lobby . DUMPTSY salutes , strenuously , and goes out . The MAJOR goes across and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 135 IRENE Some champagne , Captain ? CAPTAIN LOCICERO No , thank you very much . IRENE You need n't be anxious to avoid me , Captain . I know perfectly well that it was n't your fault . CAPTAIN LOCICERO You are very understanding , Madame . IRENE Yes  --  that 's true . I am one of the most remarkably understanding people on earth . ( She swallows her drink . ) I understand so damned much that I am here , alone , on this cold mountain , and I have no one to turn to , nowhere to go CAPTAIN LOCICERO If I can be of service to you in any way IRENE I know you 'll be kind , Captain Locicero . And faultlessly polite . CAPTAIN LOCICERO ( with genuine sympathy ) I realize , Madame , that politeness means nothing now . But  --  under these tragic circumstances  --  what else can I do ? IRENE ( deliberately ) What else can you do ? I 'll tell you what else you can do in these tragic circumstances . You can refuse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can refuse to use those weapons that they have sold you ! But  --  you were going into the bar . Please do n't let me detain you . p. 136 CAPTAIN LOCICERO You will forgive me , Madame ? IRENE Fully , my dear Captain . Fully . CAPTAIN LOCICERO Thank you . ( He salutes and goes into the bar . ) ( IRENE pours herself another drink . Then she picks it up , goes to the piano , and starts to play a sketchy accompaniment for " Kak Stranna . " She seems to be pretty close to tears . Perhaps she does cry a little , thoroughly enjoying the emotion . HARRY comes in wearing his snappy overcoat and his hat . He pays no attention to her , as he takes off his coat and hat and throws them down somewhere . ) IRENE Did you have some trouble ? HARRY VAN No . Whose is that champagne ? IRENE Mine . Wo n't you have some ? HARRY VAN Thanks . IRENE Dumptsy used that glass . HARRY VAN That 's all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IRENE What happened ? Did n't the train go ? HARRY VAN Yes  --  the train went . I got the girls on board . Mr. and Mrs. Cherry promised to look out for them . They 'll be O.K. p. 137 IRENE And you came back  --  to me ? HARRY VAN ( curtly ) It seems fairly obvious that I did come back . ( He refills his glass . ) IRENE You meant it when you said that you wanted to help me . HARRY VAN You said I 'd never be sure . Well  --  I came back to tell you I am sure ! I got thinking back , in the bus , and I came to the conclusion that it was Room 974 or close to it , anyway . And somehow or other , I could n't help feeling rather flattered , and touched , to think that with all the sordid hotel rooms you 've been in , you should have remembered that one . ( He has some more champagne . ) IRENE ( after a moment ) Bayard is not dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HARRY VAN Oh ! IRENE Somewhere in that funny , music-hall soul of yours is the spirit of Leander , and Abelard , and Galahad . You give up everything  --  risk your life  --  walk unafraid into the valley of the shadow  --  to aid and comfort a damsel in distress . Is n't that the truth ? p. 138 HARRY VAN Yes  --  it 's the truth  --  plainly and simply put . ( He pours himself more champagne and drinks it quickly . ) Listen to me , babe  --  when are you going to break down and tell me who the hell are you ? IRENE Does it matter so very much who I am ? HARRY VAN No . IRENE Give me some more champagne . ( HARRY goes to her and pours . ) My father was not one of the Romanoffs . But for many years , he was their guest  --  in Siberia . From him I learned that it is no use telling the truth to people whose whole life is a lie . But you  --  Harry  --  you are different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a short pause ) I am  --  am I ? ( He crosses to the bar . ) Another bottle of champagne . Hi , Captain . CAPTAIN 'S VOICE ( offstage in bar ) What has happened , Mr. Van ? Did you miss the train ? HARRY VAN No  --  just a God-damned fool . ( He closes the bar door . IRENE is gazing at him . He goes to her and kisses her . ) IRENE All these years  --  you 've been surrounded by blondes  --  and you 've loved only me ! p. 139 HARRY VAN Now listen  --  we do n't want to have any misunderstanding . If you 're hooking up with me , it 's only for professional reasons  --  see ? IRENE Yes  --  I see . HARRY VAN And what 's more , I 'm the manager . I 'll fix it with the Captain for us to cross the border tomorrow , or the next day , or soon . We 'll join up with the girls in Geneva  --  and that 's as good a place as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course  --  the code ! I shall learn it easily . HARRY VAN It 's a very deep complicated scientific problem . IRENE You must tell it to me at once . HARRY VAN At once ! If you 're unusually smart and apply yourself you 'll have a fairly good idea of it after six months of study and rehearsal . IRENE A mind reader ! Yes  --  you 're quite right . I shall be able to do that very well ! ( AUGUSTE enters from the bar with a bottle of champagne . He refills their glasses , then refills HARRY 'S glass , gives HARRY the bottle and goes back in to the bar . ) HARRY VAN And , another thing , if you 're going to qualify for this act with me , you 've got to lay off liquor . I mean , after we finish this . It 's a well-known fact that booze and science do n't mix . ( He has another drink . IRENE is as one in a trance. ) p. 140 IRENE I do n't think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would mispronounce it horribly . No , I shall call myself  --  Namoura Namoura the Great  --  assisted by Harry Van . HARRY VAN You 've got nice billing there . IRENE I shall wear a black velvet dress  --  very plain  --  My skin , ivory white . I must have something to hold . One white flower . No ! A little white prayer book . That 's it . A little white ( The warning siren is heard . ) What 's that ? HARRY VAN Sounds like a fire . ( The CAPTAIN and MAJOR burst out of the bar and rush to the big window , talking excitedly in Italian and pointing to the northwestern sky . The siren shrieks continue . The MAJOR then rushes out , the CAPTAIN about to follow him . ) What 's up , Captain ? CAPTAIN LOCICERO French aeroplanes . It is reprisal for last night . They are coming to destroy our base here . HARRY VAN I see . CAPTAIN LOCICERO They have no reason to attack this hotel . But  --  there may easily be accidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the bar , PITTALUGA from the lobby . The latter orders AUGUSTE to lower the Venetian blinds. ) p. 141 IRENE Oh , no , Captain . We must stay here and watch the spectacle . CAPTAIN LOCICERO I entreat you not to be reckless , Madame . I have enough on my conscience now , without adding to it your innocent life ! IRENE Do n't worry , Captain . Death and I are old friends . CAPTAIN LOCICERO God be with you , Madame . ( He goes out . HARRY and IRENE empty their glasses . HARRY refills them . Airplane motors are heard , increasing . Then the sound of machine guns . ) ( Bombs are heard bursting at some distance . AUGUSTE and PITTALUGA go . ) IRENE Those are bombs . HARRY VAN I guess so . IRENE We 're in the war , Harry . HARRY VAN What do you think we ought to do about it ? Go out and say " Boo " ? IRENE Let them be idiotic if they wish . We are sane . Why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't feel appropriate . Too bad we have n't got Chaliapin here . ( She laughs . ) You know , babe  --  you look better blonde . IRENE Thank you . ( PITTALUGA runs in. ) p. 142 PITTALUGA The French beasts are bombing us ! Every one goes into the cellar . HARRY VAN Thanks very much , Signor . PITTALUGA You have been warned ! ( He rushes out . ) IRENE Ridiculous ! Here we are , on top of the world  --  and he asks us to go down into the cellar . Do you want to go into the cellar ? HARRY VAN Do you ? IRENE No . If a bomb hits , it will be worse in the cellar . ( He holds her close to him . She kisses him . ) I love you , Harry . HARRY VAN You do , eh ! IRENE Ever since that night  --  in the Governor Bryan Hotel  --  I 've loved you . Because I knew that you have a heart that I can trust . And that whatever I would say to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HARRY VAN That 's right , babe . I told you I had you tagged , right from the beginning . IRENE And you adore me , do n't you , darling ? HARRY VAN No ! Now lay off  --   --  IRENE No  --  of course not  --  you must n't admit it ! p. 143 HARRY VAN Will you please stop pawing me ? ( She laughs and lets go of him . ) ( HARRY pours more champagne , as she crosses to the window , opens the slats of the blinds , and looks out . There is now great noise of planes , machine guns and bombs . ) IRENE Oh , you must see this ! It 's superb ! ( He crosses to the window with his glass and looks out . The light on the stage is growing dimmer , but a weird light comes from the window . The scream of many gas bombs is heard . ) It 's positively Wagnerian  --  is n't it . HARRY VAN It looks to me exactly like " Hell 's Angels . " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't care for films . HARRY VAN I do . I love ' em  --  every one of them . ( He is dragging her to the piano  --  a comparatively safe retreat . ) Did you know I used to play the piano in picture theatres ? Oh , sure  --  I know all the music there is . ( They are now at the piano  --  HARRY sitting , IRENE standing close by him . She is looking toward the window . He starts to accompany the air-raid with the " Ride of the Walkyries . " There is a loud explosion. ) p. 144 IRENE Harry HARRY VAN Yes , babe ? IRENE Harry  --  do you realize that the whole world has gone to war ? The whole world ! HARRY VAN I realize it . But do n't ask me why . Because I 've stopped trying to figure it out . IRENE I know why it is . It 's just for the purpose of killing us you and me . ( There is another loud explosion . HARRY stops playing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us the deadliest weapons are the most merciful . ( Another loud explosion . HARRY drinks . ) HARRY VAN They 're getting closer . IRENE Play some more . ( He resumes the " Walkyrie . " ) Harry  --  do you know any hymns ? HARRY VAN What ? IRENE Do you know any hymns ? HARRY VAN Certainly . ( He starts to play " Onward , Christian Soldiers " in furious jazz time , working in strains of " Dixie . " There is another fearful crash , shattering the pane of the big window . He drags her down beside him at the piano . HARRY resumes " Onward , Christian Soldiers " in a slow , solemn tempo. ) p. 145 HARRY VAN ( sings ) Onward , Christian Soldiers  --   --  ( IRENE joins the loud singing . ) BOTH ( singing ) Marching as to war  --  With the Cross of Jesus Going on before . ( The din is now terrific . Demolition  --  bombs , gas-bombs , airplanes , shrapnel , machine guns. )        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
