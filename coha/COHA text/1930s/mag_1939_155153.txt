In football , linemen do the dirty work but the backs get the bouquets . This year , as usual , pre-season football prognosticators focused their attention on the outstanding college backs of the year . Most experts agreed that this year 's crop was the most brilliant collection of all time : Michigan 's Harmon and Kromer , Purdue 's Brock and Brown , Notre Dame 's Saggau and Zontini , Tennessee 's Cafego , Pitt 's Cassiano , Fordham 's Eshmont , Duke 's McAfee , many &; many another . <P> Last week , on the third Saturday of the season , some of these stars twinkled , others were dimmed : <P> At Pittsburgh , Dick Cassiano and George McAfee took turns dazzling a crowd of 50,000-but Cassiano 's teammates were quicker on their feet , defeated Duke by the margin of a point-after-touchdown ( 14-to-13 ) in the biggest upset of the week . <P> At New Orleans , Len Eshmont ( No. 1 ground gainer last year ) was swamped by Tulane 's smashing Green Wave-and Fordham , pre-season pride of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Deep South for the second week in a row ( last fortnight it lost to Alabama , 7-to-6 ) . <P> At Minneapolis , Purdue 's famed halfbacks , Lou Brock and Jack Brown-aided by a third buzzing B , Mike Byelene-swarmed over a Minnesota powerhouse , held it to a 13-to-13 tie . <P> At Chattanooga , Quarterback George Cafego , who led Tennessee to an undefeated , untied season last year , led his teammates to their third successive victory this season-over Chattanooga , 28-to-0 . <P> The back who shone most brilliantly last week was Tom Harmon of Michigan . Against Iowa , Junior Harmon , a 9.9 sprinter and champion hurdler , scored every one of Michigan 's 27 points : four touchdowns ( including a 90-yd. dash after intercepting a forward pass ) and three conversions- as magnificent a display of fancy field running , forward passing , blocking and place-kicking as has been seen on a college football field since the days of Red Grange . Michigan 27 , Iowa 7.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
