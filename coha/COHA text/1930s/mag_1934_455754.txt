Tuesday , October 31 , 1933 I SAT on deck sewing as we went through Hell Gate , feeling very much the schooner housewife ( Stephen called Inc ' Tugboat Annie ' ) . We anchored off the New York Yacht Club at 26th Street , and Lucius came on board for lunch . He picked up a china plate to see the trade-mark on the back , noted the silver dishes , the candlesticks , and all other appurtenances of elegance , he tried the electric lights to see if they really worked , and departed ? not without noticing that there was a slim volume of his own verse among the books . He asked me where we had found our steward-sailor , and I had to explain that he was the carpenter 's son , that he had never cooked or been on a sailboat before , but that we had engaged him because he was so nice . We continued down the East River , hugging close to the shore by the Battery , the New York sky line towering above us tremendous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny little tugs manoeuvring great rafts of railroad cars . I marveled that there were not constant collisions . We passed Governors Island , where I had been as a child to see Dad receive his Distinguished Service Cross . On that occasion I wore a new hat with blue wool flowers crocheted upon it , and I remember that I had great difficulty in deciding whether to choose blue for infantry or red for Harvard . The sun set behind the Statue of Liberty . In the dusk we anchored on ashallow place half a mile from Gravesend between three barges and a big full-rigged ship . A large and brilliant moon had risen early , giving the scene a dramatic quality . Stephen and I sat on deck a long time after dinner . Ferryboats kept passing by us and we could hear the music of popular songs and 0 Sole MM ' played by accordion men who collect nickels and dimes from the passengers . In the middle of the night I sat up with a start . Then I heard it again ? a long cry all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schooner , ' repeated over and over . We were dragging anchor and about to collide with the full-rigged ship , whose watch had wakened us . The moon was still full and bright , but a wind had sprung up . It was strange , stumbling on deck from a sound sleep , to see the other boat looming so close . November I Last night we ran aground off Atlantic City . It was horrible and I did not like it a bit . We had been sailing since five o'clock in the morning , arriving off Atlantic City about 10.00 The shore was so thickly sprinkled with lights , including many colored ones , that we had difficulty identifying the red and green light buoys marking the channel . Cautiously we proceeded . Stephen stood in the bow , calling to me where the unlighted can buoys were . Two slid by , and we knew we were in the channel . Then , with no warning , there was a grind , a crash , and another WE LIVE ON A SCHOONER ess crash . We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into reverse , then full speed ahead . For one suspended half second I thought we might get off . ' Then again that pounding crash , crash , crash ; then an interval , and again crash . The whole boat shook and quivered so that it tore one 's heart , and her stern was lifted up . We sent off all the Very pistol cartridges and some twenty Roman candles that were left over from the Fourth of July . It was not comforting to see waves breaking on a sand bar a hundred yards away . Stephen said , Well , I guess this is the end of this boat . ' There was no danger to ourselves , for it was a still and beautiful night , but many silly things kept flashing through my mind . I wondered which of the books I should try to save first . I thought with a sort of sad despair of the hours I 'd spent on my hands and knees making a paper pattern of that very irregular floor space so that we might have a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I had decided to consider the Morgana our home ; of the fun we had had making her habitable ; of the fights over what things to take on board ; of the morning the carpenter sat so patiently on the companionway steps while Stephen and I argued about which bunk should be torn out to build a double bed ; and I thought I had better put all my jewelry into my pocketbook so that it would be saved ! when the time came to desert the ship . After what seemed like hours , but was actually , Stephen tells me , about twenty minutes , the Coast Guard arrived and , with one of their seventy-five-footers , pulled us off without much difficulty . We rolled around by the green light buoy at the channel entrance , waiting for leaks to develop ( surprisingly , none did ) , while the Coast Guard asked us questions . They said the sands had shifted , but that the buoys had not yet been changed , and advised us to proceed to Cape May . Vie ran under power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm , unruffled sea was like liquid Monel metal . We talked quietly together . About 4.00 A.M. the Delco seemed unusually low , so I turned out the binnacle light and steered by moonlight . We strained our eyes trying to pick up lights . At five o'clock we anchored at the entrance of the channel into Cape May . Going below , 1 sat down for a minute and immediately fell asleep . I woke up at 0.30 when I heard the anchor being taken up . It was quite light . Fishing boats , long strings of them , passed us going out . Cape May harbor is completely landlocked ? mostly sand dunes ? a barn-like airplane hangar ? not very pretty . We dropped anchor at 7.10 A.M. and everyone went to bed . November 0 , AT Core MAY The stepson of the owner of the wharf at which we are tied up came to dinner . He arrived resplendent in a blue uniform with much gold braid and brought with him a girl and a basket of boiled crabs . He was young , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his remarks concerned a lady who had recently been killed in an automobile accident : ' Of course we were all very sorry she was killed , but at the same time we were sort of glad that something had happened to a Cape May person . ' November 10 , ANNAPOLIB Yesterday I had intestinal grippe and felt very sorry for myself , but today I am sitting up in bed wills the door open so that I can listens to tine talk going on between Stephen and the man who is aboard to fix the Delco . As usual , he is tearing everything apart . They all do that , but the one before last could not put it together again . If I had my way this would be purely a sailing vessel and we should burn oil lamps . All engines are so completely incomprehensible to me that I feel they are purposely perverse and malicious , with wills of their own . Occasionally I join in the conversation and it is very cheerful . The electrician says that he thought the play , Fata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad that the name of our boat has no connection with either . Before the war he was in the German air force , from which he was discharged for dueling . He joined the U. S. Navy and was one of the seven men with Commander Rodgers when his plane went down in the Pacific . They were adrift nineteen days . Three of them then went crazy , jumped overboard , and were eaten by sharks . Later . ? Our electrician has just left . When I called out that since I felt so much better I thought I would take a bath , he jumped up . ' Lady , ' he said , dear Missis , I beg of you ? it is most dangerous to bathe before forty-eight hours . If you will allow me to make you a nice cup of tea . . . ' So we had a tea party ? Stephen , the electrician , and I in a pink wrapper . He told us that he had been in so many airplane crashes that he was held together entirely by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we told him about ourselves . November 4,5 , MOREHEAD CITY A disreputable little yawl called the Astra ? two men and a woman aboard ? is anchored next to us . We have been watching them curiously all day , for the men wear black flannel shirts and have shaggy beards that grow surprisingly high up their cheekbones . In general appearance the trio is what escaped Bolshevists should look like . This afternoon the little man , who is very clumsy , was fixing something on the bowsprit when one moccasin fell off . As it floated by I fished it up andcalled , ' Would you three care to come to dinner with us to-night ? ' So they will be here in another hour . Later . ? When the Astras came down into the cabin they immediately commented upon the Mangravite still life and admired the John Carroll water color , adding , ' Never saw a water color of his before ? thought it was a Marin at first . ' Then they fell to discussing rigging and sea anchors for the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm day , the sky very deep greenish-blue , the wind southwest . I am sitting on deck . Stephen is ashore painting . The night before last , just at sunset , we were watching the big hermaphrodite brig Intrepid , which had lain in here the past four days , sailing out with all her sails set and the slanting rays of the sun making her brass blaze like fire , when we noticed a small boat rapidly approaching . Something about her looked strangely familiar , as did the antics of the figure on the bowsprit taking down the jib . That 's the Astra all right , ' said Stephen . And a little later we were greeting the as though they were our oldest friends . Later. ? Boat populations being very transient , we are beginning to feel like the proprietors of this place . Whenever a new boat comes in we run along the wharves and stand critically watching while it docks . Then we saunter back to the Morgana and go below , knowing that , as soon as they have tied up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other boats . In the beginning , Stephen picked up everyone and asked him to dinner . Lately , however , he has developed a more discriminating method . He sits in the cabin with the skylight open while Ellison , who is usually working on deck anyway , engages them in conversation . If they sound interesting , he pops his head up and says , ' Hello , wo n't you come down and have a drink ? ' The annual trek South is still going on , and every day new boats come in and others leave . In this year of depression there are countless people doing just what we are ? living on a boat for economy . A pathetic number know practically nothing about sailing except what they have read about it in books . They plan to explore every one of the South Sea Islands and talk vaguely of ' writing , ' but their boats are obviously unseaworthy and they have come this far entirely by inland waterway . They ask us where we are going and I am tired of explaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; that we like boats and this one happens to be our home ; that , besides , my husband has a certain amount of work to do , as he is having his fourth one-man show in February . This afternoon , coming back from Meeting Street , I stopped over by the Astra . Mrs. P , a towel round her head , was washing up the whole place . ' Do you know , ' she said , this is the second time I 've been moved to do this . The first evening we came on board the Morgan I felt inspired ; and now that I 've been over there on the Imp , when I came back I said to myself : " Well , a palace like the Astra should be kept up like a palace ! " ' I agreed , and she went on , He ' s rather a character . I felt kind of sorry for him , so I had him to dinner this noon . ' I wandered over to see the man on the Imp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beam and was actually a yawl , for a crooked little stick stuck up on the very stern . The owner asked me to come on board if I could find a place to sit down . The deck was taken up by a curious superstructure and a great pile of old bits of iron , rusty hoops , crowbars , links of chain . He had been three years coming from New York . He nourished a mania for making everything himself . his steering wheel was an old Pontiac hub with the Indian head still in evidence . If he needed a new mast he anchored by a wood for a few days till he had cut and made one ( he indicated his latest  --  the little jigger-mast ) . Whenever Ise walked along the street he kept his eye out for things that ' might come in handy sometime ' ( he waved his hand at the pile of irons ) . I felt like Alice talking to the White Knight , and indeed there is a strong resemblance between the two kindly old adventurers with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no money , but he had no expenses . His engine pushed the boat at two miles an hour . When I got home I told Stephen about him and about the I ' ? s having him to lunch . I said sadly , ' The P ? s never ask us to meals , but We have them here often . ' Stephen laughed and said that harbor etiquette demanded that the bigger boat always ask the little one ; when we are in port with the Few Winds , it is always the Harrises who ask us to dine . Then I told him that the man on the Imp was not the last of the line . He had picked up a man who was cruising South in a rowboat . January 17 , 1974 , CHARLESTON We have decided to go to Bermuda . I was surprised to find that it is about eight hundred miles from here , farther than it is from New York or from Portland . Stephens has sent for a professional navigator , since we shall need another man for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been provisioning the boat , having made out long lists of food that run down three big sheets of paper . Mr. L ? , the navigator , has arrived . A thick fog is shutting in , which is exasperating ; we are all getting fidgety . January 23 We are flying the Blue Peter . Ten ten-gallon cans with extra gasoline are filled and lashed to the deck . The rugs have been rolled up , the brandy and wine glasses and my blue glass jar all carefully stowed . The ceiling of cloud , cracking momently , gives place to great patches of blue sky , and the wind has at last shifted from northeast to west . We have had a telegram from Washington with a favorable forecast : ' West and southwest winds . No storm areas visible at present . ' The coal , after delaying us for over an hour , is this minute arriving , carried in bags on the shoulders of five Negroes . They make a slow procession . We cast off at 12.15 . When we were clear of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men got up the sails . It is seven weeks and two days since they came down . I relinquished the wheel to Stephen as we approached Fort Sumter . The sun is very warm , the wind light , and I have put on my Boothbay straw hat . I looked back at Charleston . I saw the white steeple of Saint Michael 's , the red steeple of the new church , the steeple of Saint Philip 's ? thin spires against the tranquil blue sky . I saw the huge and hideous Fort Sumter Hotel rising above the trees of the Battery Park , and glimpses of white buildings and red tile roofs . It looked mellow and picturesque and full of romance , very much as it appeared to us the day we sailed in here when our knowledge of Charleston was based solely on Porgy . An oil tanker passed us in the channel . The skipper called , ' Good luck ! ' 4.00-5.00 P.M. ? My watch . We are already well beyond sight of land . The sea is calm . Mr. I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anchors . Stephen went aloft to fasten the hoops more securely to the stays ? he looked like Queequeg on watch for a whale . The color and clearness of thewater are marvelous after the muddy yellow of the harbor . 7.00 . ? Supper . Paper plates already seem natural . We are becalmed . 8.00 . ? Stephen and I take the long watch ( 8.00 to 12.00 ) . There is moonlight . We have brought the small radio on deck to play . We relieve each other at the wheel every hour . 10.00 . ? A fresh wind has sprung up from the north , quite contrary to all weather predictions . We gather speed and are soon making about eight knots . There is a continuous gurgling swish and the moon catches the bow wave whitely . It becomes increasingly rough as we near the Gulf Stream . 12.00 , midnight . ? We are relieved by Mr. L ? and Ellison . January 24 3.45 A.M. ? Everyone on deck to take down the jib , which has torn . A big wave soaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ? Breakfast . Beverly is sick , so out of bravado I cooked . Nothing would stay in place on the stove , and I had to brace myself to stand up . Feeling giddy once or twice , I quickly stuck my head out of the galley hatch . There on the ladder is one of the pleasantest places to stand , for the little hood protects you from spray and wind , yet you can hear very close the crash of the bow wave . The water is indigo blue , with bits of Gulf weed floating by . The wind is still strong . The boiled eggs turned out hard , but I blessed a strong stomach and ate mine anyway . Below-decks is in its usual disgusting , unbelievable mess ? even worse than usual because of wet clothes everywhere . Later . ? The rip in the sewing had grown so much that the four men took down the mainsail and set the storm-trisail . The sea was confused and the wind strong . I became exhausted by taking the wheel from 11.00 deleted material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Savannah , Morehead City , Georgetown ? 11.00 . ? The pump is now working . Extra gasoline from the cans has been poured into the tank and the engine started , for it has just been announced that We are probably twenty miles off Charleston ? this being our fourth day at sea . liven now this expedition has its elements of humor , and , for the discomforts , some marvelous compensating moments . Such small blessings , like the sunrise , a calm moment to cat , an hour to lie down , are intensely appreciated . Then , too , from this trip I have learned a lot about what one feels like eating in unhappy moments : dry , tasteless crackers and unlimited coffee come first , then hot soups or mushy platefuls of milk and shredded wheat . Liver , nuts , and raisins are apt to disagree . No one feels like eating lettuce . I have also acquired a more than nodding acquaintance with the Gulf Stream . While out at sea among big waves I constantly thought of the accuracy of Rockwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the decks of steamers may think of it as a straight line , but from a small boat , where the eye is only a little above water level , it always appears irregular , jagged , punctuated with high peaks . Its nearness and mountainousness change continuously as the boat goes up and down the slopes of the waves . 2.30 P.M. ? The lead has shown ten fathoms , now it shows eight . I have the horrid dread that We may go on shoals . No one is certain of our position , but I have been praying that we may end up any place but Charleston . I could not stand seeing that Ideal White Swan Laundry man grimacing around again . 4.00 . ? Stephen has identified our position as Winyah Bay . We are now , therefore , running toward Georgetown , which is nine miles up a river . 6.30 . ? We passed long stretches of sand near the entrance , but lately the channel is rather winding , with trees on either side . The river is perfectly still . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems incredible that not many hours ago my whole life centred on how soon I should be relieved at the wheel ; that I could look forward to nothing farther ahead than when I could next stumble below and lie down . Those days in the Gulf Stream are already beginning to lose whatever unpleasantness they had , for that is one of the curious things about sailing . I have spent a charming hour scrubbing the single stateroom rug , having removed the worst grease with a knife . 0.50 . ? The anchor chain has just run out . I popped up to take a look at Georgetown . It is dark , but my impression was of an attractive , friendly water front of a small old town . Very quiet and still . Ashore to telephone our families . February 6 , GEORGETOWN , S. C. It rained all day , but nothing leaked , since we have put glue in the cracks . Stephen painted me in the cabin . It was not a success , for he caught a frozen expression on my face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first half hour you became numb and could pose indefinitely ; so I thought I would try it . February 7 7.1.5 AM . ? A glorious day . We could tell it was fine from the patch of blue we see through our skylight , but on deck the early morning sunlight is dazzling , the colors of everything extra fresh and newly washed . I started to do exercises , the hop-scrabble-hop ' Dad used to make us do on the lawn before breakfast . All the rigging is frosted white . Our bare feet have made footprints in the dew on the deck . 3.00 PM . ? Lunch at last . Stephen was ashore painting all morning . The picture is really a portrait of the Cornwallis ( the miniature ferryboat ) , but he has painted also the quality of this still clear day . February S 11.00 A.ns . ? Lunch . Stephen went ashore to paint directly afterward . He is working much better here than in Charleston , where he was continually irritated by the self-conscious picturesqueness of the place . 2.00 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to New York , to Charleston , to Bermuda . There is a reproduction of Stephen 's ' Cocktail Hour ' on the cover of the Art Digest . I have been reading Sir Edward Grey 's Fallodan Papers . He lists gardening as one of the highest forms of pleasure . Although he does not say so , I think that is true because you make and improve something with your own hands , then stand back and admire your creation . In a minor way , it must be the same satisfaction that an artist feels . Ellison experiences it , for this morning when he rowed me ashore he said , ' I always go all the way round the boat after I have been working on her to see how much better she looks . ' ( He has been painting the stays . ) Certainly it is a peculiarity of both boats and gardens that you willingly go grubbing on your hands and knees for them and take a most passionate pride in the results . Living on a boat , you can never quite take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the most ordinary occurrences ? baths , and candles on the table , for instance . When a storm howls outside , the snug safeness of a small harbor seems incredibly dear , and after we have been fog-bound we put to sea again as though it were the most exciting thing that ever happened . To know the kind of day is always interesting . Being with Stephen has made me aware of what I see ? two colors together , a strong straight line in opposition to a delicate curved one , the rhythm in railroad tracks or telegraph poles . There is a faded purple stucco store with an old awning striped turquoise and white , a bunch of bananas in the doorway with a small but brilliant red tag , that I have seen him look at each time we go by . 5.15 P.M. ? Stephen returned . This week he has painted five pictures ; four are as good as anything he has done , but he is very depressed . He feels , What 's the use , when painting is no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly it was in the Renaissance ) ? People do n't look at pictures ; they either buy what they consider Georgian pictures to go in their Georgian houses , or keep the same ones until they are as meaningless as part of the wall paper . A picture should be changed once in a while or hung in another place to give it new life . I made him a cocktail to try to cheer him up a bit . February 14 They have made a big crate and all the canvases are packed in it . Since we have no suitcases , we packed most of our town clothes in on top of them , which I think will be a surprise to the gallery . There has been such a disheartening accident . As Stephen and Ellison were lifting the crate from the tender to the wharf , it slipped and fell in the water . Every single canvas was soaked . I cried , but Stephen says that after a little restretching no damage will have been done . Thank goodness ! March 88 , GEORGETOWN 11.15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so glad we can stay at anchor ; we had to get special permission from the harbor master . There is no privacy tied up at a dock . Loafers gather , cross their arms on the big fat posts , and gaze down at us from only a few feet away , so that I hardly feel like reading on deck , to say nothing of skipping rope or doing exercises . They even watch us eating in the cabin when the skylight is open . Our present position gives us a feeling of dignified seclusion , yet is a conveniently short row ? barely a hundred yards ? from shore . And from lucre we command the whole water front : from the little Coast Guard station , cupola on top , painted gray with white trim , to the old brick clock tower with its belfry and gold weather vane . In between stretch low flat-roofed buildings , some of extraordinary colors , and , instead of a sidewalk or back yards , a long broad wharf . Sometimes when I go ashore at low tide I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular steps , but a large fat Negro cook always comes running out to help me , with wide grins and many exclamations . I am settled in Use cabin . The Delco is not running , Ellison and Beverly make no sound but the quiet slap-slap of their brushes as they paint the Morgarta 's sides . I have been thinking of all our early struggles with the various mechanical parts of the boat and of how , as Stephen said , they really made us love her more . Just now everything looks so nice . The sun coming through the open skylight lies in a crooked strip across the red rug and the blue chintz couch , jiggles over the yellow cushion in one corner , and goes in a flat broad band up the white wall . I have some corn bread in the oven , but the day is so calm I doubt if it will be a success ? the heat of the oven has some mysterious relation to the direction and velocity of the wind . Once I had to cook a brown Betty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a glass of sherry before lunch and remarked to earls other for the thousandth time how pleasant life was , here on our boat . Afternoon . ? The Mayor 's wife sent me out a basket of pink camellias , which pleased me very much . Dinner early ( shad ) , then to the movies . It is very warm . I wore my blue linen dress . March 47 Breakfast , 8.15 . ? I finished U stream , one of the best things I 've read lately , and started Cabell 's new book . Went ashore to buy food for 12.50 lunch ( shad again , since we leave here is soon ) . Stephen 's Uncle Ott , whom he had not seen in six years , turned up this afternoon . He stayed to dinner , so of course we had shad again . It is our prize dish ? Beverly cooks it to perfection and it is caught here in the river only a few hours before we eat it . Stephen gave Uncle Ott a big cocktail , we had Rhine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite loquacious . He is an amazing person , and , I thought , charming . Apparently he spends all his time driving about the country by himself , visiting graveyards . As a side line he has been tracing down the Etniers and has decided , to his brother Carey 's disgust , that they were of German , not French , origin . He told me very seriously that he had gotten over seven hundred , but there were two or three good ones he just could n't lay his hands on . ' ( Etniers , he meant . ) Marsh 48 Uncle Ott came down to say goodbye . We were planning to go down to the mouth of the river in the afternoon and leave for Southport to-morrow morning , but at noon Stephen telephoned Mr. L ? to come at once and help us deleted material mer when I would sit on deck in Boothhay . People say the coast of Maine is grim and forbidding . They are wrong . It is firm and strong , with jagged reefs and rocks that would pierce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall black spruce pierce the blueness of the sky ; but everywhere it breaks up into safe , welcoming harbors . There are trees and grass and deep water . The Southern coast ? unending stretches of sand , no harbors except where occasionally a channel has been dredged through a sand bar , no tree or rock or hill or tuftof green grass to break the monotony ? that is my idea of an uninviting and forbidding shore line . The people we have met in other places we have compared unfavorably with Maine people . I know this is an exaggerated example , but in New York we saw a play , Tobacco Road . It was about the struggle of a man , against overwhelming circumstances , to save his land . Every character in it was highly staked . Their fates were as unhappy and wretched and miserable as fate can be . But , although intensely interested , I was not moved by their disintegration . Suddenly I remembered the old Greek notion that tragedy should deal with kings or princes , so that the fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write a tragedy about a Maine man , however poor , bemuse there is an internal dignity in him that would make the spectacle of his fall great and moving . The Northern spring is more touching than any other . All the way up the coast I have watched the spring coming to different places . In Georgetown it came slowly , luxuriously , lazily , taking many languorous days . In Maine the snow melts and leaves in its place drifts of tiny white wild flowers across emerald grass , while the air still tastes like a drink of ice-cold water . The light in Maine is different from the light anywhere else But I must stop now because Stephen wants me to take the wheel . Later . ? Stephen has set the balloon jib and a small , high fisherman staysail that we have never had out before . It is another glorious day . This morning we were under way at 7.45 ? a light southwest breeze which seemed to be strengthening in puffs . Little silver crescents chased each other over the blue water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel over it , bending the tops of the grasses so that the sun catches the stems and causes fleeting shiny patches . On the sea it happens more frequently when the water is a pale smooth silver and the puffs ruffling the surface make darker patches scudding over it . Now it is eleven o'clock . The wind is steady , so that all the sails are filling beautifully . We are having rum flips on deck . 1.15 . ? Lunch . Paper plates unnecessary , the boat is so steady . We have passed Cape Porpoise . Cape Elizabeth is ahead . Ellison has seen a whale spouting . 3.30 . ? I have had the wheel the past hour . With every sail on the boat drawing , she is running as dead before the wind as she can go , precariously near the jibing point . There is a long following sea . Every now and then a wave , lifting up the stern , gives us an even greater impetus forward , then sizzles along the side . Halfway Rock has been in sight for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Green , Hope , Jewel . I remember how proud I was , when I was first married and came to live in Maine , because I learned their names so quickly . Great Chebcague , Brown Cow , Bates , Ministerial . Farther ahead is Haskell 's Island , and , off the other bow , the unmistakable humped back of Whaleboat . I can even see Ragged Island , way off toward Small Point , which marks the top of Casco Bay as Cape 1- ? imbeth does the bottom . All day I have been noticing this peculiar Maine light . In No More Sea Wilson Follett describes it , saying that the ' high clouds , flat as marble slabs on their under sides , turned a kind of refulgence downward , investing ' the landscape ' with an inexpressibly beautiful and strange distinctness ' till you felt you were ' seeing new-created colors , or old colors through new-created eyes , so limpid and tenuous was this cloud-refracted northern air . ' There are none of those high flat-bottomed clouds to-day , but the islands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen nowhere else . Perhaps the sun 's rays striking at a sharper angle makes the light in Maine different from that of places more in the middle of the world . Stephen and I have climbed out to the tip of the bowsprit . From there you can see nothing but canvas ? sail overlapping sail ; the great belly of the balloon jib , the small high fisherman , the foresail out one side , and the mainsail , straining forward with the full brunt of the wind , out the other . If you put your head way back you can see , above everything , the home-coming pennant streaming forward against the sky . We are passing Eagle Island . The forward sails are flapping SO that I hold my breath for fear of a jibe , but they will fill again as soon as we round the buoy off Flag Island . I can see Ellison 's house sitting in the little semicircle of bright green grass at the head of Tide Mill Cove . I have never seen such variousness of green ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in vivid chartreuse streaks through the dark mass of the pines . Soon we shall have passed the point . We are going fast and still carrying all sail . Ellison , his eyes dancing with excitement , says , Keep it up , Steve . Let 's run her right up on the mud at the end of Ash Cove . ' The Merriconeag is almost abeam . I remember once last summer , coming back from a cruise , we came through the Gut just at dusk . It was quite still and the boat seemed moved forward by some invisible force . We were going through a school of sardines . In the dark water they looked like a whole lot of silver quarters that you had thrown overboard . We stood in the bow and I thought that this was what corning into heaven might be like ? at twilight , in the bow of a ship moving mysteriously . Then the funny old shape of the Merriconcag Hotel would come into sight and you would recognize where you were .. . At this point Stephen thrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The , ails came down with record speed and efficiency and everyone silently congratulated himself , for an audience had gathered on the side , of the hill , holding up an American flag to welcome us . Feeling very proud , I swung the boat in as big a circle as I dared and headed her into the wind . She hung there motionless , the mainsail flapping . Ellison and Beverly stood ready to trip the anchor ; but Stephen , calling ' Wait a minute , ' dashed below . He was back in a second , shouting ' All right ! ' As the anchor dropped , he fired a Very pistol cartridge into the air . I watched the pale green light shoot upward , then fall slowly into the water . In daydreams one always stages such things as home-comings beautifully . Actually , they seldom come off in their full perfection . It happened that this one did .
