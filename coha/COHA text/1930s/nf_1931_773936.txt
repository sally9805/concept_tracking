txt // by the shallow buttress projections of the period , and similar but wider projections at the angles , carried up as towers . The external face of Castle Rising has simple arcading , but this is exceptional . The windows are small , semi-circular headed or square openings , occasionally coupled , as in Norman domestic work . The entrance was usually on the first floor approached by means of a stone stair , either left exposed or covered by what is known as a fore-building . That at Castle Rising has an effective architectural treatment ( Fig. 45 ) . Inside the keep the designer was sometimes allowed some scope . The chapel in the ' Tower of London is exceptional , but the chapel at Newcastle has elaborately carved arcading , the cross wall at Rochester ( Fig. 42 ) has a fine series of arches , and the galleries round the two-storied halls , as at Castle // Hedingharn , are beautiful features . The last named is furnished with fireplaces , which are not unusual in military buildings of this date . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed to a later date were the cylindrical or polygonal keeps designed to avoid the square angles that hampered defence . Orford in Suffolk is one of the earliest ( 1166-1172 ) , Pembroke one of the finest ( c. 1200 ) and Conisborough , with its striking octagonal projections around it , is prophetic of future developments . But when , in the xiiith century , the keep had been perfected to provide a final and impregnable refuge for the garrison , the requirements of the castle began to change . We have seen that although in the early castles the domestic buildings occupied the bailey , the keep was planned for use as a residence in time of peril . Now , however , the curtain wall began to assume a greater importance in the defensive system , and the house within the bailey expanded within the increased security . It is difficult , perhaps , to say which was " cause " and which " effect , " but it is certain that strengthening of the the outer walls was accompanied by an elaboration of the house within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtain rendered the keep unnecessary or even useless . The history of the castle dwelling-house belongs properly to domestic architecture and beyond the greater thickness and general solidity of the walls it has few features differing from unfortified buildings . The Great Hall , occasionally aisled as at Oakham Castle and Warkworth , was built against one of the walls , and the range of buildings , including guest chamber , kitchen , storerooms , chapel , etc. , extended in varying directions . From this point , however , we shall see a gradual merging of the house and castle , and domestic convenience and elaboration become gradually more important as the need of defence dies away , until we meet the house that is castle only in name , and keeps its character only by an outward resemblance . The inevitable effect of abandoning the old system of defending a castle first from its approaches and last by its strongest feature , the mount and the keep , was to make each section of the curtain of equal strength and to centralize the defence . This can be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 49 ) with their great towers ranged around the curtain , and in the concentric castles of Harlech and Beaumaris , where // a second ring of fortifications surrounded the lofty inner one , and both were furnished with many towers . During the period at the end of the xiiith and the beginning of the xtvth century the gatehouse again grew in importance , and not only was it elaborately constructed , being guarded by twirl flanking towers , but it possessed many devices such as double or triple portcullis , and machicolations , formed by projecting the parapet over the gate on corbels of stone to allow of dropping projectiles from holes in the rampart floor . And further than this , the gate was often protected by an outwork or second gate-tower built in the moat , and termed a barbican , such as that at Lewes ( Fig. 46 ) , where it has circular turrets at the angles and machicolations above . The centrally-defended castle tended in time to become more regular in plan and to lose the old apparent haphazard grouping . // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defence stronger than the attack , emboldened the garrison to make more gateways in their walls to aid them in their sorties , and a large front and rear gatehouse became the rule . And in the new plan the enlarged dwelling-house within the castle was disposed in equal manner around the walls , consolidating the whole into one coherent scheme . Such is Bodiam Castle , built by Sir Edward Dalingridge in 1385 , where the quadrangular plan , with round angle towers , and two gatehouses and two square towers in intermediate positions , give the final form of the castle in England . The fortifications of towns , of manor houses , of bishops ' palaces and other defended places , all borrowed something from the military architecture of the period . The defensive towers and the ramparts of towns may be seen at Oxford and Southampton , but in all these works the gatehouses form by far the most important features . When the need for serious // fortifications had passed away , and nothing more was required than a gate to check unwelcome visitors , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military strength . Hurstmonceux in Sussex , Oxburgh Hall in Norfolk , Layer Marney in Essex , afford striking examp'es of defensive features turned to architectural account . And the gateway at Hadleigh rectory , the Tudor gates at St. James 's Palace and Hampton Court , and the entrances to the Colleges of Oxford and Cambridge , remind us of the measure of beauty and dignity which such a survival can confer . In earlier days it was not unusual to see a strong tower added to a manor house to provide a refuge against assault as at Stokesay in Shropshire , but here the gateway was of timber and gave no protection . The licence of treatment in the formidable erections of later days betrays their unmilitary purpose in an age when gunpowder had revolutionized the arts of fortification . CHAPTER VI BUILDING IN THE XIIITH CENTURY IN architectural language we call the building of the end of the xtlth century by the name " transitional . " In the broadest sense of the term all periods are times of transition , but this is the point of transition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architecture of the Normans began to clothe itself with a vestment which we call Gothic , when the round arch gives place to the pointed , the full half circle to one composed of intersecting curves . Such a trans-formation , with so little essential alteration in structure , could scarcely have been foreseen , and it certainly holds a unique place in the whole history of the builders ' art . The term transition carries with it the idea of something new grafted on to the old . It is not the same type of change as that profound revolution at the beginning of the with century , the Renaissance , which was a relinquishment of familiar forms in favour of the re-birth of an ancient style . // This transition was a genuine growth , but it was a development that transformed as well . We have now to regard the Roman-esque from two points of view . It was in itself a completely satisfying form of building , indeed many people prefer it to Gothic even to-day . It became also the ground and framework for the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supreme beauties we can not forget the Romanesque foundations on which they were built . The triumph of the first rests in no sense on what came after it , but the second could hardly have had birth without its forerunner . Yet , in spite of the virile charm of the wonderful buildings of the Normans , we are probably correct in seeing in their work the striving of the medieval period to express itself in a manner which should ( and ultimately did ) give a more perfect image of its own ideals . It is not easy to understand these things ; almost the only interpreter is the art ( and the religion ) of the time . Many writers , with political bias , treat of the age as unenlightened and unprogressive ; others see in it a paradise for the artist , and , on very good grounds , they acclaim the whole population as artists , actual or potential . People of the medieval period hid their real thoughts in symbols and ceremonies ; they revealed them in their art . From the xuith to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the produc-tion of beautiful things . There was no stagnation , no pause , no flagging in the eager activities of the craftsman . Lack of money did not stay him , ' no opportunity escaped him ; explain it as we will , there is no denying his enthusiasm and its magni-ficent results . We are to study , then , a period of enthusiasm for art , both for its own sake and as the finest vehicle for expressing the religious spirit , and we are more likely to be right in seeing in it a sign of the identity of interest in all classes than in trying to square the results with a preconceived notion of tyranny and oppression . The feudal idea of protec-tion on one side and service on the other , carried with it an admission of the danger from evil allied with power , since the very system was the only bulwark against this evil . The Church could be oppressive too , but the same checks were // there , the same balance of power , and the forces for good were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community commanded in the main the loyalty of ruled and rulers alike , and a higher ideal even than that was persistently before all classes in the zealous ministrations of the Monasteries and the secular Church . The study of the medieval period is a most fascinating one , and not least because , being a period of active production , it expressed itself so little in literature and so much in the practical arts and crafts . In spite of stories of violence , feuds , of times of plague and scarcity , England must have been a place of quiet and happy industry : and of much gaiety . The atmosphere of Chaucer 's Canterbury Tales has more affinity with the care-free artistry of the medieval craftsman than the current conceptions and uncertain opinions of these present , different and harassed times . The chief factor in the great change which was now to come over architectural design was fortunately one which set it definitely on the upward instead of the downward path . It would have been easy for Romanesque building to have degenerated under the overplus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders of Monks and Canons , the Cistercians in the first place , and after them the Augustinian Canons and others , set themselves against elaboration , and sought to bring their buildings to an almost puritan simplicity . In their search for means to express the purer and more exacting service of religion to which they addressed themselves they adopted the pointed arch , which had already occasionally appeared , and they applied it to the whole system of building . The ruined quire and transepts of the Cistercian Abbey of Rievaulx ( Fig. 54 ) will show at a glance what a change is thus made , not only in the actual form , but in the very atmosphere of the architecture . The pointed arch was , no doubt , the outcome of a desire for greater refinement , and at the same time it became an incentive towards a finer delicacy of arrangement and detail . It achieved its purpose in the most amazingly complete manner , and it is worth noting that , although it took a little while before it permeated the building of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very beginning . In such a masterpiece as the Galilee porch at // Ely the full beauty of this new style seemed achieved at once ; as so often occurs with the finest creative art , its birth and its perfection occurred at the same rnoment . Although the pure science of Gothic construction may be studied best in France , the English architects carried its extreme elegance of form further than their continental rivals , and nothing can exceed the fairness of English work in the x111th century . One of the things that helped to this end was our beautiful Purbeck marble , which was wonderfully adapted for the little shafts which now began to stand free from the walls and piers instead of being worked on the angles of the stonework. , In the sketch of the . quire of Pershore ( Fig. 53 ) these shafts , and their fairy-like lightness of effect can be well seen . The shafts were turned in the lathe , and it 4 // seemed a natural step to turn their capitals and bases as well ; and to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capital . It will have been noticed that the Norman Capitals always had a square capping stone , or " abacus , " beneath which were the various forms of " cushion " which united it with the circular supporting column , as in the large arch of New Shoreham ( Frontispiece ) . This square abacus continued to be used in the transitional period and remained even when the Purbeck shafts were first detached from their piers ( see Chichester , Fig. 55 ) . The French , adhering to a classical model , retained the square form , but we invented the circular abacus ( as at Lincoln , Fig. 56 ) which , whether a plain turned bell , or adorned with // clean-cut foliage below , held an infinite grace , and seemed to grow into , as well as support , the clustered mouldings of the arch . The supreme sculptural quality of this new style of archi tecture is its chief glory . The bold mouldings of a few years before were transformed into a crowded company of delicate lines separated by deeply undercut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the mouldings softened and enriched the pointed arches , large and small , and their contours were exquisitely conceived . The carved foliage , where it occurs , was sparingly used , but unerringly placed , and its long stalks and crisp heads gave point to the contrasts of light and shade ( Figs. 55 and 56 ) . We can scarcely , then , mistake the work of this inspired period in the English art of building , when we meet it in our cathedrals and our churches . We can recognize it by its translation of all the elements of Norman composition into its own language , but we shall find a great deal more than this . The pointed arch is a much more elastic piece of mechanism than the round arch ; in the case of the latter , the height of the crown of the arch is determined by its span , but the pointed arch can be raised or lowered at will , and the variations in its acuteness become only an added delight . The assistance which this gave to the problem of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the transverse and the diagonal ones could all be raised to the same height without difficulty , and so a new and lofty type of vault came into being . The pointed arches thrust much more against the outer walls than the round ones , and so the deep external buttresses were built as a counter-weight , and the whole building became a poem in perfect equipoise . Gables and pedimental forms assumed a steeper pitch and were adorned on the outside with crockets , scraps of delightful carving , such as those on the little dormer lights of the spire of St. Ceorgc 's Church , Stamford ( Fig. 57 ) ? and with this greater freedom of arch design came the infinite variations which light clustered shafts and attached columns allowed . The architect could set his building in almost any key of sober solidity or fairy grace , or he could combine these opposite characteristics , setting off the one against the other . The xiiith century can give us a building with almost the massive simplicity of Romanesque , with scarce a moulding , except to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could also open the door to a new world of sculptural form whenever the designer willed . During the first part of this period the window openings remained small in width , but increased in height , taking the form known as the lancet . Often the inside arch of the window splay was elaborately designed , with shafts and delicate mouldings , and these inner arches and those of the triforium and similar arcades assumed a trefoil shape , which seemed a natural outcome of the pointed arch . We will reserve until a later page the story of how the lancets became grouped in windows of several lights and how the space above , contained within a single arch , developed into the window tracery of the xlvth century . But we may be prepared to find in the xtitth a number of simple types , chiefly of two lights , with a pierced quatrefoil or trefoil above , forms of very great beauty . The geometrical figures in use were few , even in the rose windows , and the great aisle windows of Henry III 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intersection of curves are seen , but the interlacing of patterns is , as yet , rare . The doorway at St. Mary Overie , Southwark ( Fig. 58 ) and the trefoil headed windows in the tower of St. George 's , Stamford ( Fig.57 ) give a measure of the limits which the period set to this type of adornment . Happy were the masons of the xiiith century who had found a new means to raise the great architectural monuments that were required of them . They had no ideal of mechanical accuracy , but they were on the road to great discoveries , and the harmony of form which they sought drew out of them the whole of their powers . They had no time to rest on their laurels , their work everywhere shows the vitality of the pioneer , but that they had pride in their work is shown by the inscription on the floor of the amazing chapter house that Master Alberic and his fellow-craftsmen built at Westminster . From the fragmentary letters Professor Lethaby has recovered this precious sigh of satisfaction and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ista domorum As a rose among the flowers so is this chamber among buildings . ' It was in no vaunting spirit that this inscription was placed here . It was a tribute of a great period to its craftsmen , and embodied an appreciation fully confirmed by posterity . // THE PARISH CHURCH FROM THE XIITH TO THE XIVTH CENTURY IT is very natural that we should , in our study of Architecture , be drawn to the great buildings , the cathedrals , abbeys and castles , in which the artist has shown the height of his genius . But it is safe to say that we shall gain a more intimate knowledge of the work of the medieval builder by visiting with attentive care the churches of our town and country parishes , which reflect so faithfully the life of the periods they served . It is easier to understand an art or a craft in the making than when we meet the supreme and finished product . Everywhere , in every village , the mason and the carpenter were experimenting in the methods in vogue in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful things in the service of religion , claiming at the same time the praise of their fellows . // The parish churches of England are as numerous as they are precious ; scores of them are still happily almost untouched by the restorer 's hand , and it is among these we must seek first of all . Being outside the orbit of modern life and its changes , they have been saved by their poverty , and the message they have to tell is still clear for those who will learn how to read it . To study the parish churches of England is not only to explore one of the most fruitful fields for a knowledge of our architecture : it is to trace the development ( and sometimes the decline ) of an institution which is very like a living organism . At every point the parish church has touched the intimate life of English men and women , around it clings the memory of all the generations before our time , and in the fascinating variations which we can easily bring ourselves to recognize , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we have any instinct for the quest , we shall find no end to the questions these buildings will answer for us . We must not imagine that all churches have grown from small to large , although it is instructive to note the changes that have taken place in a church which has started with a simple plan and modest dimensions and has been successively enlarged to meet , first the needs of a growing population , and later those of a more elaborate ceremonial . Already in the sixth century there were many degrees between the tiniest nave and chancel ( two-chamber ) plan and those collegiate churches that approximated to the full cathedral arrangement , where the services were choral , and a large body of clergy assisted . Most of the additions to a small church were in the direction of the fully-developed plan of the larger buildings , if only for the reason that the latter formed a well-understood model for a fine church , but they were also dictated by practical necessity , always under the inspiration of a desire to achieve a beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style , the differences , for instance , between xttth and xtvth century churches are to be found , on the other hand , in the structure of the buildings and their detail , and in a minor degree only in their plan and arrangement . The ritual needs of the smaller churches were simple and clearly defined . The chancel belonged to the priest and his assistant , who conducted the services at such of the canonical // hours as were usual , with no reference to the people in the nave . The Norman chancel was often a little longer than its width ? a virtual square ? while that of the xtiith century was generally twice as long as it was wide . The structural furniture consisted of an altar , to the east , a piscina ( a recessed sink // with drain ) , in the south wall , sedilia ( recessed seats ) west of the piscina , and perhaps a small aumbry ( or cupboard ) in the east or north walls . The chancel arch was in early times often narrow and sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the two parts of the church . The nave was a place of assembly for the villagers , where they came together for many other objects than worship ? yet there was always a view of the altar from the nave through the chancel arch and its screen , and also sometimes by means of openings at the side of the arch , so that during the cele bration of Mass , etc. , they could observe the eleva tion of the Host , and kneeling , par ticipate in the ceremonial . There might be rave Altars , one each side of the chancel arch , dedicated to different saints , for use only on special occasions ; when the chancel arch was a wide one , these altars were at times placed against a screen , or at the East end of the side aisles , and their former position may be revealed by indications of special features or decoration on the wall behind them . In the Nave were also the font for the rite of baptism , and north and south doors with porches , near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doors themselves being open to the // processions which passed to and from the churchyard . The position of the tower varies in different buildings . The most usual place for it was at the west end , where its lower storey some-times formed an entrance vesti- hole , and the bells and bell-ringers ' chamber were provided for above . A cruciform plan ( with north and south tran-septs ) generally shows a central tower carried on the arches of the crossing , ( as " in Figs. 65 and 77 ) and occa- sionally the the chancel , as tower formed Smetimes a at Newhaven . o transept was carried up to form the tower , and there are many cases where the tower stood attached to the north or south side of nave or chancel , in the position dictated by convenience , or it may be found detached from the church altogether , // as an isolated campanile . In every case the tower provides us with an interesting little problem in the history of the Church , and its date is generally subsequent to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tower , the bells were hung in a belfry , either in the west gable , or in a loft formed by raising the western roof-bay , a chamber being constructed at the west end for the bell-ringers . Here , too , was later placed a gallery for the players on the musical instruments that led the singing in the xviith and xviilth centuries . We shall consider in a moment the extension of the church plan by the addition of aisles , and in a later chapter we shall refer more particularly to the side chapels which form so important a part in the variations in parish church plans , and add so much to their beauty . It is sufficient to say here that manorial history is intimately connected with every village church , and that civic life is reflected as closely in the churches of a town . The custom of burying in the church , the altartomb , and the services in memory of the dead , formed the occasion for countless additions and alterations to the fabric of the church , and the architectural and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Norman builders design the parish churches of the xith and sixth centuries ? The smallest two-chamber buildings had thick walls of plastered rubble , with faced stone at the angles . Sometimes we meet buildings of wrought stone throughout , but where rubble or flint is used the outside was finished with a thin coat of plaster . Where this has fallen away we shall often see the Norman habit of setting small stones or flints in courses , but set sloping alternately to the left and right ? what is called " herring-bone " work ? and where you see this you have a pretty safe indication of date . There are often little projecting string courses or horizontal bands cut with a chevron or other ornament , and near the top of the walls , especially on towers , will be found a corbel table , where the wall face projects slightly and is supported on a row of grotesque little stone heads . The " apse " or semicircular end to the chancel ( Figs. 60 and 71 ) is not an infrequent feature of Norman churches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being of the xtith century . The round towers that are met with in different parts of the country , and especially SS THE EARLIER PARISH CHURCH in East Anglia , are of many dates , and were probably built to avoid the necessity of worked corner stones . In these Norman churches the chancel arch , the south and north doorway , the tower arch , and the priests ' door in the chancel were semi-circular in form , the chancel arch and the south doorway being more elaborately treated than the others . This elaboration was very simply gained by recess ing two or more superimposed rings of stone , in the " orders " which have already been described ( p. 45 ) . Roll mould ings appear in some of the arches , shafts with cushion // capitals support them , and the side chiefly in view is found enriched with the characteristic Norman carving . The " classical " character is maintained by such features as a rude pediment enclosing the arch of the doorway and many other little details which are clearly traceable to Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became transformed in the new archi-tecture . With the chancel arch may be compared the arches divid ing the central part of the nave from its aisles . The student should learn to differentiate between churches which were built originally with aisles and those ( a numerous class ) where the aisles have been added . Since the usual main entrance to the nave was on the south side , it was preferable to add a north aisle first , thus avoiding disturbance of the porch and the graves that were here more crowded together . To form access to the aisles , arches could be cut through the old external wall , and indications , such as portions of early win-dows left behind , bear witness to the change . The legs or piers of these arches were the replaced by circular columns , and we can see many devices to marry the circular form to the square masonry above , the top of the capital gen erally taking a square form . In many of our smaller churches the aisle was roofed by merely extending the nave roof downwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Later on , these walls were raised // and an independent roof provided , and the date of this improvement will be naturally marked by the new windows . The aisles were not invariably added to increase the accommodation for worshippers . They were quite as often needed for sepulture , chantry chapels and altars , and they were subject to frequent alterations for the same purpose . All these successive modifica tions and extensions can be traced by the marks they have left upon the building . The windows of the Norman church were usually very narrow circular-headed lights , opening by side splays on to the interior , // and they were often placed high in the walls ( Fig. 60 ) . At the East end the favourite arrangement was a triplet of three independent lights , the centre one higher than the others . In larger churches these round-headed windows were wider , and the inner or rear // arch , as well as the outside , might have attached shafts and an arch moulding . The grouping of two lights within one arch which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churches , except in the belfry openings of towers , and this important development , which was to result in the wonderful traceried windows , was left to the architects of the xuith century . It seems , however , to have been deliberately rejected , for not only was it in use in domestic buildings , as well as in the triforium , etc. , of the larger churches , but an even closer approximation to tracery is to be found in the Wheel windows which were inserted in such tiny churches as Barfreston ( Fig. 36 ) . This example shows also the amusing decoration in which the sixth century sculptor indulged . The band of carving round the window and the sturdy little columns are wholly classical in their design , but the embryo of a trefoil in the eight radiating lights is more than prophetic of the Gothic forms that were to come . The change of detail from the Norman to the Gothic work of the xIIIth century , that transformation which has been described in the last chapter , can be studied in every one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change is as complete and outstanding as in any of the greater buildings , but more often it is gradual , and the contrast is less vivid . There is a great deal of transitional work of the end of the sixth century , round arches with deeply-cut and delicate mouldings , pointed arcades to piers which still show the square abacus and cushion capital , bits of fresh vigorous carving amid the earlier type of structure . Where money was scarce there is a simple Romanesque look about the new style of building , ornament and mouldings are rare , and the doors , windows and arcades are plain and solid . Yet the new development shows itself , the circular bell capital becomes universal , the lancet window is adopted , lights begin to be grouped under one arch , deep buttresses appear , even when there is no vault , to strengthen the walls where they carry the massive tie beams and king posts of the open timber roofs . And in many a secluded church some craftsman who has worked on the neighbouring cathedral or abbey is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to introduce the delicate Purbeck shafts and foliated arcades , and make the building a shrine full of the beauty of the new style . // In the parish churches of Northamptonshire of the xilith and xtvth centuries may be seen the fully developed style we know as " Gothic . " The towers grow upwards into spires within a cluster of pinnacles ; the steep gables at the roof-ends are clearly marked ; the arches and windows are of fine contour with deeply-cut mouldings . Where local quarries of generous stone favoured good craftsmanship , where money was not lacking and zeal was high , you can study the work of the medieval artist at his best ; but at his worst , and in the most unfavourable conditions , you will still find him an artist , and an artist true to his age . It is this that makes all his work so well worth discovering . The walls of the early parish churches were covered with paintings , Bible stories in fresco , saints and angels framed in simple decoration ( Fig. 66 ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " God the Father sitting in Judgment . At times crude , at other times exhibiting great skill in pose and drapery and composition , these drawings , like all the socalled " primitives , " were full of glorious colour , and never failed in decorative quality . They were the counterpart of a fine school of English figure sculpture of the xiiith and xivth centuries . ( See reliefs at Higham Ferrers . Fig. 133 . ) CHAPTER VIII THE FRIARS AND THE LATER PARISH CHURCHES WE have considered in the last chapter the main characteristics of the parish churches from the xilth to the xlvth centuries , the churches that served large rural parishes , and those that are to be found crowded together in our ancient towns . Cities like London , Norwich , Lincoln , Exeter , were filled with small churches , fresh accommodation being found not by enlarging existing buildings , but by raising fresh ones of modest dimen sions . The form of these churches , too , was a collection of separately designed compartments , chancel and nave , aisles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where one can pass from one architectural effect to another , full of strange contrasts in light and shade , pervaded by a sense of depth and mystery . At the threshold of the xlvth century there appeared in England a new influence , which was to effect a great change in church building . The last phase of monasticism produced // the Orders of Friars , who , vowed to poverty ( they are called the Mendicant Orders ) took up preaching as their chief vocation , and , unlike the monks , settled in the midst of busy towns . Receiving favour from the king and the nobles , and popular among the people , they were enabled , without a technical breach of their vows , to build fine churches and habitations , at the expense of wealthy patrons who placed at their disposal the means which they were forbidden to claim as their own . Sepulture in a friars ' church was sought by all who could afford the privilege , and gifts were showered upon them from high and low . Preaching was a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church , and it necessitated a novel handling of the problem . It is curious , however , that architectural development had already reached a point which made the new idea a possibility . We have already noticed in dealing with the great abbeys and collegiate churches that the principle of arch construction , culminating in the stone vault , had made it possible to carry all the weight of the building on a series of stone columns or props , which appear on a plan as detached points . These props were ( within the church ) the piers that carried the main arcades , and ( externally ) the little sections of wall , each with its buttress , which divided the windows of adjoining bays . As the mason 's skill grew , he could open his arches to a greater width and height , while he reduced the size of his piers ; and , in the walls , he could increase the area of his windows to satisfy the growing desire for stone tracery and painted glass . This was just what the friars wanted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as little obstruction from piers and as much light from the windows as possible . They planned a church of large dimensions , with wide aisles , the arches of which were lofty and set on slim piers or columns of stone . The aisle windows were broad and high , and above the aisle arcade the nave was lit by a noble series of great clerestory windows . Compare an outside view of the church at Aunsby , Lincs . ( Fig. 73 ) , with that of Blythburgh ( Fig. 85 ) , and the difference between the earlier and the later manner will be at once apparent . Again , contrast the interior of Atherington ( Fig. 99 ) , with that of St. Mary Astbury ( Fig. 76 ) and see what a change has been wrought . Astbury shows a great hall , lit to the fullest // extent , and enlarged at the sides by the open , airy space of the aisles , and although this is a late example of a xvth century church , its design is in principle the same as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Norwich . The situation of the friars ' houses in popular centres contributed to the total destruction of the great majority of their noble churches built in the reigns of Edward I and Edward II ; but in the work of their contemporaries we can see that their example was quickly followed by the new towns which were springing up in the xivth and xvth centuries , and the fashion of the single great parish church became immediately and firmly established . The influence of the friars on the later periods of Gothic architecture is a subject of great interest , but can not be pursued here . A charming feature of their churches may , however , be mentioned , the cunningly-contrived lantern which rose over the junction between the nave and the eastern arm or presbytery , a beautiful example of which remains at Kings Lynn ( Fig. 84 ) . In it will be seen the germ of many a later tower and cupola , with graceful windows set in each storey , and a staircase turret rising above its crown . There are many features that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churches that were inspired by the innovations of the friars . Foremost among them is the traceried window , which provides a never-ending and yet a delightful study . From the first grouping of lancet windows under a single arch in the xilith century and the tentative piercing of the stone spandrils with foliated circles , to the realization that moulded bars were sufficient to separate the openings , followed by the full development of a graceful geometric pattern , there is a long story of infinite variety in form . The early simple windows depend much upon the delicate moulding and shafting of the rear-arches that framed the internal splays , but as the tracery itself became the chief feature , the reararches reverted to plain chamfered openings in the walls . The xtiith century is sparing in the forms employed , showing that reticence which is so necessary where refinement of contour and modelling is the chief aim . With the increase in technical skill the masons threw off their reserve , and geometrical ( Fig. 112 ) flowing ( Fig. 80 ) , and reticulated ( Fig. 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the widening arches . There seemed indeed no end to the geometric figures and foliations // that could be invented , all to set off the richness of the dyed and painted glass , until men tired of their complexity , and a new manner , more reposeful if less inspired , came in with the tracery called " Perpendicular " ( Figs. 76 and 97 ) . The influence of the friars is not to be directly connected with this development of window tracery , although it undoubt edly helped the tendency towards larger windows . Luxury and wealth of detail and ornament seemed to be the innate destiny of the Gothic style , and even the friars ' own churches , that started in austerity and with a severely practical purpose in view , became infected with a magnificence that drew upon them the picturesque satire of the author of Pierce the Plowman 's Creed . It is difficult , but it is none the less essential , for the student to keep certain main tendencies well in mind , and at the same time to be prepared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen the sudden transition from the simple and ponderous Romanesque forms to the multiple grace of the xnith century , yet we may expect many a little village church of the time of Henry VII to guard the early proportions with scarce a moulding or a shaft to adorn the pointed arches of nave or wall . In like manner the xrvth and xvth centuries can show us , side by side with the lofty , well-lighted interiors , built on the friars ' model , churches of // massive construction , traditionally planned , and governed by an older rule . In such churches there will be no lack of sure signs by which to date them , and the tracery of an east window , the capital of a single pier , an arch here or a door there , will tell its story . One can pick out of each century , from the sixth to the xvth , a large number of churches that show a more or less regular movement from the early to the late stage of Gothic architecture , but the examples are scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local circumstances . Yet through the whole period the detail , that is , the mouldings ( where they exist ) , the capitals and bases , // the tracery and form of windows , proceed consistently with equal progression , and form a technical guide and index to the progress of the years . The friars ' church was an intelligent anticipation of the final development of the Gothic church of the xvth century . In the xiiith century the architect had solved the difficult questions of construction that the Normans had prepared for him , and in doing so he had invented a satisfying harmony of form which is truly termed a " Style . " But whereas his solution in its initial stage was aesthetically perfect and complete , it showed the way to a structural development that outgrew the limits of the style . Pride in skill , which rose rapidly in the xIvth century , was scarcely checked by the devastation of the Black Death in England , and in the xvth century the enormous expansion of the crafts urged the designer to take greater liberties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his work was still of very great beauty , is all the more wonderful when we see whither he tended , for as surely as religion was moving towards the Reformation , as learning was reaching forward to the Renaissance , so architecture was feeling for a re-discovery of Classical ideas . This is the really interesting phenomenon of xvth century building , the spectacle of architecture shedding its essentially medieval features in an attempt to transform itself , an attempt that ultimately failed // because it could not permanently satisfy the new desire for classical beauty . Yet it seemed a logical process . With his greater skill the architect reduced the girth of his piers , heightened them , and enlarged his arched arcades . His windows filled the space of each bay , his regularised window tracery repeated itself as a panelled surface on those walls that were not pierced . His vaults were cleverly lowered in pitch and carved with a network of ribs that harmonized well with wall and window . His mouldings were subdued like his tracery to form a texture of enrichment unembarrassing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had been tame were it not for the sumptuous fittings with which it was furnished , and of which we shall speak in the next chapter . Indeed , a normal late xvth century church is lacking , in a very large measure , in the sculpturesque quality , the mystery , and the rhythmic cadence of the earlier buildings . But this is felt only in a church like Bath Abbey , where the stone architecture is unrelieved . The medieval carpenter , in most cases , saves the situation by a roof of barbaric splendour , which of old shone with the gayest colour and gilding ( Figs. 89 to 92 ) . The great tie-beams and hammer-beams ( Fig. 90 ) , the pendants and arched braces carved from huge oaks , with the regular spacing of their trusses and rafters , seem to save the building from itself , and to re-introduce a primitive vigour that contrasts charmingly with the finished elegance of the mason-craft . Well may we say that the roofs of the famous xvth century churches of Somerset and East Anglia are their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast , and it is necessary to point out where the building of the xvth century strays definitely into a mode altogether different from the summit of Gothic architectural achievement . Yet we must not fall into the error of calling the work debased . At times it may fall short of greatness , but the bulk of the work of this century is in a very high degree beautiful . Not only had inspiration not died , but the art impulse was strong enough to survive in the next century the most drastic change it could know . The love of beauty was as keen as ever , the devotion to an ideal as enthusiastic , even if the vision were not so unclouded as before . Let us consider a moment the exterior of a great East Anglian parish church . Against the sky-line the silhouette of the nave with its range of jewelled clerestory windows and lace-like // parapet ; below , it is supported by a broad aisle with another range of fine windows ( Fig. 85 ) , divided by buttresses that pierce the parapet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similarly treated , stretches to the east , and at the west end is a magnificent tower designed with fine skill , both in its mass , set off by weathered courses at each stage , in its window openings and its elaborate parapet and angle turrets . The whole building is faced with cut and squared flints , worked into stone traceried panels ; a beautiful two-storeyed porch with niches for saints , pro jects from the south front , and the whole building is nobly planned and superbly modelled . With the interior of such a church we shall deal later . Looking at it from a distance we may see in it the last native design for a great church , springing from a still living need and for a purpose still fraught with real meaning . After this , churches ceased to be built , save on rare occasions , or when a catastrophe like the Fire of London made the opportunity . The medieval church , in England , had run its course , and this was the great and final expression . // CEREMONIAL EXPANSION @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wonderful develop-ment of the crafts in the late xivth and the xvth centuries . Desire for a display of beauty grew with the growth of the resources and skill that were able to produce it . Workers in stone , wood , metal and glass increased in numbers and in dexterity , and wealthy patrons , guilds and corporations com-peted for the services of all who were cunning in design and workmanship . The earlier centuries produced , indeed , greater architects , but the xvth and the early part of the with century had no lack of fashioners of exquisite furniture and ornament . The Church still held the power of focussing the arts . The parish churches , as well as the monasteries , the cathedrals and collegiate churches , had their ample endowments . When a man died he left money or lands to his parish church , to found , in the old phraseology , a chantry , or , in other words , to have his name and his gifts remembered by prayers to be said for his soul . The abbeys and cathedrals had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gifts ? the pilgrimages to Walsingham and Canterbury , for instance , were important episodes in medieval life ? and these tombs of the saints grew in lustre and riches . The town and village people , associated in guilds , contributed money for altars and vestments . The pre-reforma-tion inventories of our parish churches are our authority for the wealth they contained . // In the structural furnishing of the churches , the carpentry of the roofs and the painted glass of the windows take , perhaps , the first place . We have already noticed the important develop ment of the timber roof and its value in the later stage of building . The simple elements of the early roof were converted into a complex of arched timbers , traceried panels and pendants . The great timber arches of the main trusses were transformed by the introduction of hammer beams and hammer posts , the former carved ( Figs. 1 and 90 ) , the latter converted into a backbone or centre for curving ribs , and spandrils filled with open tracery . In this way the lofty roofs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright with colour and gilding . Where the roofs were flat in pitch , the great tie-beams were richly carved and battlemented , and beautiful brackets supported them on each side . The under surface of the roof itself was often panelled ( Fig. 92 ) or made a network of tracery by arched and cusped wind-braces and the lean-to roofs of the aisles were furnished with moulded members and curious bosses at their intersections . To appreciate the beauty of medieval painted glass , and to gain an idea of the part it played in the making of the church , it is necessary to visit a building like that at Fairford , which has , // by a miracle , retained the greater part of its storied windows . In the delightful tracery of the stonework a richer pattern of colour , brilliant with the light that transfuses it , fills us with admiration . The figures of sacred story , the saints , the fathers of the church , emblems , heraldry , and an infinite variety of ornament appear , in this wonderful medium , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supernatural character . In the glass and in the paintings that were freely used in the decoration of wall surfaces , both the drawing and the colour were strictly in harmony with what we may call their architectural purpose . From the point of view of the realistic schools of modern painting , the pictures of this period , whether in glass or tempera , are called primitive ( Fig. 96 ) . The laws of perspective , of anatomical structure , etc. , were often disregarded . A beautiful pattern of colour and form was aimed at , treated , as we say , conventionally , but it was extraordinarily effective as decoration , and successful too in emphasizing the message which these religious symbols was meant to convey . In no department of medieval art can we learn better concerning the spirit of those times than in their painted walls and windows . Closely allied to the oak roofs are the screens that may be found all over the country , but chiefly in East Anglia and in Devonshire . The chief screen , filling the space under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wonderful development in the xvth century , and became a wide gallery in its upper part , called the rood-loft , carried on an elaborate imitation of vaulting in oak . There are many beautiful screens , however , belonging to the end of the xitith and the beginning of the xtvth centuries , like those at St. Mary 's Hospital , Chichester , and the parish church of Eastbourne ( Fig. 68 ) . The upper part is filled with tracery of geometric pattern , carried on little circular shafts , and the beam above is moulded with the characteristic deep hollows . In the xvth century the woodwork is lighter in construction but the design becomes more elaborate , and a series of carved cornice members are introduced , until the great vaulted lofts are at last evolved . These screens , which were not only used as rood screens but also as parcloses to divide the side chapels , etc. , were painted and gilded like the roofs , and the panels of the lower parts were filled with figures of saints , often worked in low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with gesso . Stone screens were in use in the larger churches , such as those enclosing the ambulatory chapels at Westminster , and the important barriers to the quires of monastic churches , and an early metal one is to be seen at St. Albans . In most cases the old principle of design was followed , and the constructional detail of pier , buttress , battlements , crockets , arch and window tracery , was reproduced in its proper scale . This system of architecture in miniature is most evident in the little enclosed or chantry chapels that were really elaborate chambers for tombs . The chantry chapels at Tewkesbury , Winchester ( Fig. 86 ) , and Wells ( Fig. 97 ) , are good examples where the tomb with a small space for the officiating // were made of heavy planks , largely held together by the elaborate wrought iron hinges and straps of the xllth and xIllth centuries ( Fig. 39 ) , were later adorned with vertical slips , covering the joints of the boards , an opportunity for working the upper half into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared in the carved texture of which the whole church seemed to be woven . In collegiate churches stalls were provided east of the chancel screen , and for some distance on either side of the presbytery . These might be of any degree of richness , from a row of seats with a carved poppy-head at each end , to the elaborate misericordes with hinged seats , conceal ing the familiar carved group on the underside ( Fig. 102 ) . Canopied s talls ( Fig. 101 ) were reserved for rich churches , but carved bench ends of infinite variety are to be met with , not only in chancels , but through-out the nave seating of many parish churches . The favourite finial of poppy-head form is borrowed from the apex of a crocketted gable , and the bench-end itself is panelled with tracery or carved with figure subjects at will . West Country churches are singularly full of these fine enrichments to the church seating . There are a number of good medieval pulpits both in stone and in wood ( Fig. 103 ) ( not forgetting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hereford ) , and the development of this feature ? beloved of the puritan // was not checked by the Reformation . Pulpits and altar rails ( introduced first by Archbishop Laud ) figure largely in post-Reformation church furniture . The font cover , of which comparatively few examples remain , was evidently a favourite subject for the woodworker 's art  --  it is often a veritable triumph of ingenious building up of architectural composition in miniature . The font cover at Ufford attains the height of 18 feet ( Fig. 94 ) . Lecterns , when of wood , furnish further examples of rich carving and ornament . The xvth century was thus a period of great expansion in the carpenter 's craft ; the joiner as we know him to-day had hardly appeared , for even the smaller pieces of furniture were put together in a way that was scarcely to be distinguished from the constructional timber work . The mason , on the other hand , whose work in the preceding centuries had represented the summit of architectural attain-ment , was at this time somewhat sobered , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ornament which was in sym-pathy with the times . The free expression of the pointed arch was now fettered by its enclosure within a square frame , and the spandrils or triangular spaces between the arch and framework were carved with many devices ( Figs. 82 and 83 ) . The intersections of the multiplied ribs in the later vaulting were marked by elaborate bosses , the subjects of the carving // in the tombs and memorials which filled the chancels , chapels and aisles of our churches ( Figs. 104 and 105 ) . The altar tomb , with its recumbent effigy , had reached a wonderful pitch of excellence in the xivth century , and showed a rapid develop ment from the simple grave slabs of the xitth and xntth centuries , which , however , had already exhibited some notable achieve ments in this direction . A great school of carvers in alabaster , too , arose in the Derbyshire quarries , and their figures are to be found all over the country , and in numbers that increased in the century follow ing the Reformation . Purbeck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and especially for the slabs that covered them , which often bore beautiful brasses in place of figures in the round . But free-stone was also used quite commonly , and wonderful canopy work was schemed above the tombs . The sides of the tombs were covered with traceried panels , heraldic devices , and often by little figures termed " weepers " in arched recesses . The whole tomb and the canopy were covered with colour and gilding , and beautiful inscriptions were cut on the edge of the slab , and in panels in the wall at the back . These tombs were rich ornaments to the church ; they were often the occasion of structural additions and ornament , and repre-sented endowments left by those who were commemorated . They were ( and still are ) a powerful factor in preserving the historical consciousness ; in them the homage of past ages and generations was crystallized and avowed in the parish church . We can follow the fancies of the masons in many other features connected with the church ceremonial . Volumes have been written on the beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went through certain well-defined stages till it reached the fine series of " Sacrament " fonts in Norfolk . These had excellent carvings on the faces of their hexagonal or octagonal bowls , and were raised on lofty bases with many steps surrounding them ( Fig. 100 ) . In the treatment of sedilia , piscina : ( Figs. 69 and 106 ) , and stoups , there is a delightful variety and invention . The Easter sepulchre will be found in many churches . But some of the most attractive features are to be seen in the personal badges , heraldry , symbolism , and even the lettering that occur both inside and outside the fabric . The whole of the parapets of Long Melford Church bear a band of Gothic lettering , and similar inscriptions adorn the sills of the windows of Cullompton , where the buttresses are carved with picturesque badges , including ships in full sail . Flint in-filling is deftly used in the East Anglian churches to form sacred monograms and symbols ( Figs , 82 and 108 ) . // The worker in metals contributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gold and silver communion plate and the ornaments of the altar , there are lecterns of brass , like the pelican at Norwich , and the smiths were busy on screens and grilles to tombs as well as elaborate door hinges . The fine effigies to the royal tombs at Westminster are a class in themselves , but the beautiful memorial brasses are found throughout the country . A very large number have been destroyed , but there are few churches that do not possess some survivals , even if it be but a finely-engraved inscription , the best examples being very elaborate and of great beauty . The craftsmanship of the workers in lead may be seen in towers and spires , in roof features like the famous lantern over the crossing at Ely , and also in a number of fine cast lead fonts throughout the country . Nor must the bellfounders be forgotten ; the medieval bell is a work of art and bears in many cases both decoration and inscription of no little interest . So throughout the whole of the fittings of our churches we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find none unworthy of the high purpose to which they all were consecrated . // CIVIL AND DOMESTIC BUILDINGS OF THE MIDDLE AGES In the preceding chapters we have occupied ourselves chiefly with church architecture for the simple reason that the forms which building took to itself in the Middle Ages were , in the main , developed from the requirements of religion , which throughout the period was the dominating intellectual and civilizing influence . In a second volume we shall study the civil and domestic building that occupied the architects and craftsmen of our country after the Renaissance had secularized the national life and profoundly changed men 's ideals and preoccupations . Something must , however , be said of the town and village dwellings , the manor-houses , cottages , guildhalls and market crosses which , with other buildings of a merely useful purpose , were the work of the same artist-workmen who built the churches and cathedrals . In the whole of medieval architecture the same methods and the same details are to be found , with only such variations and modifications as reflect faithfully the different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a transparent directness of method // governed the builder 's art . It is therefore just as important to make ourselves acquainted with the social and family life of the period as it is to learn the requirements of religious worship , if we are to gain an insight into the meaning of house and cottage , and fit ourselves to recognize and appreciate their beauty . the first thing to realize is that in the earlier centuries the individual privacy associated with modern life did not exist ; the household lived , for the most part , together in the " Flail , " not only working and taking meals together , but sleeping in the same house-place . At night the hall was a dormitory , and by day a general living room , however large the family and however numerous , within reason , the dependants . As in ancient Greece in the hall of Odysseus , the beds were made up , ranged along the walls . The bed , like the board for the meal , was a moveable piece of furniture , and the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neces sarily mean that the life was rude , for have we not a similar practice in the hospital ward and the school dormitory ? Grosseteste 's directions to the Countess of Lincoln , in 1240 , // concerning the duties of the mistress of the house are worth reading in this connection . ' The fact that the house was largely synonymous with the hall or house-place made for great simplicity in the medieval dwelling . When , with the growth of a more complex social life , privacy came to be sought in the addition of other rooms , these formed , as it were , extra buildings attached to the hall . Just as we have seen that the parish church was often a group of separately constructed chambers , so the house , until the middle period of the Renaissance , tends to show its internal arrangement by external divisions with separate roofs . The notion of making one rectangular block and sub-dividing its interior is a modern one , although we have noticed something of the sort in the arrangements of the great keeps of Norman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds any temptation to " evolve " the medieval house from military architecture . If the house were fortified , it might borrow certain features from the castle , but the domestic buildings , whether alone or within a fortified enclosure , have a character quite their own , and we shall be on surer ground if we seek the impetus for their development within the monastery more than anywhere else , for the monks built their hall and kitchen as cleverly as their church and chapter-house , and domestic architecture owes much to their skill and industry . The domestic arrangements of the monastery were , as we should expect , very simple , although planned often on an imposing scale , and carried out with a fine sense of the beautiful in form and colour . On the side of the cloister opposite the church was the great dining-hall ( the frater ) where meals were taken in common ( Fig. 116 ) . Frequently placed on the upper floor , it was approached by a stair at the lower end , and near the entrance there was provision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful arched recesses ( Fig. 115 ) , but occasionally in a separate compartment projecting into the cloister square . At Westminster there was a row of cupboards for the monks ' towels . The frater had a range of windows north and south , ' on one side looking over the cloister roof , // and a pulpit , recessed in a side wall towards the upper end , accommodated the monk who read aloud during the meal . There was often a separate entrance for the abbot or prior near the upper end , and the entrance stair communicated with the monastic kitchen , a lofty chamber , at times vaulted , like the famous one at Glastonbury , and fitted with very large fireplaces . The frater , like the dorter or dormitory ? another spacious hall which occupied the East side of the cloister from the chapter-house southwards , communicating with the church by a night stair ? was covered by a lofty roof of oak , divided into bays by trusses , such as we have described on page 110 . All the principal buildings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fashioned by the repetition of roof and window bay ? the frater , dorter , infirmary , guest-house , necessarium , s and the abbot or prior 's hall , in his own // " lodging , " which was often in itself an excellent example of a fully-developed medieval dwelling . The destruction of the monasteries by Henry VIII has deprived us of an enormous number of these beautiful buildings , but in the ruins of many of them , and in the remains that have been converted into private houses we may see enough to recon-struct them in our minds . The dorter of Westmmjnster is now the school hall , as is the frater at Dover , the fraters of Battle and Evsby ( Fig. 1 12 ) are splendid ruins , the guest house of Sherborne is the school library ? from survivals such as these we may re-create the great buildings that have gone . Before we turn from these monastic halls to those of the private house , we ought to mention the gatehouses or entrance gates to the precinct , which have in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In medieval building a ' gate ' generally meant a gatehouse , that is a more or less elaborate structure with rooms over the archway and sometimes each side . These gatehouses were a customary feature , not only of castles , walled towns , and other fortified places ( see ante pp. 65 and 66 ) where they formed an outward and formidable defence , THE GATEHOUSE but of manor-houses , farms and even enclosures within a town , such as those to a cathedral close ( Fig. 50 ) or a bishops palace . They led into an outer court which contained the stables and dependants ' quarters , and they seldom lacked some beautiful adornment , beside the picturesque grouping of gable , turret and arch . The xtvth century gates of Kirkham Priory ( Fig. 4$ ) and Battle Abbey ( Fig. 51 ) show a widely differing treatment , and the gatehouse of Northborough ( Fig. 6 ) is a good example of a normal entrance to a country manor house . Where a house was defended by a moat or where the appearance of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequence to the building , the gatehouses were of more massive and elaborate construction , as at Oxburgh and Hurstmonceux . In a position , generally opposite to the gate , and separating the outer court from an inner one , stood the hall ( Fig. 119 ) . Its essential features were a dais or raised floor at the upper end , and at the lower , a screen and a passage between the screen and end wall . This passage communicated with both the front and back courts by doorways , and also , by means of two or three doors // in the end wall , with the kitchen and larders . The hall was lit by a range of windows high up in the walls , ' but near the upper end there was often a beautiful bay window , forming a deep recess , in which the lights were brought down to within a few feet of the ground . It is possible that the pulpit recess in the monastic f rater suggested a feature that developed into those lovely oriels , with their many tiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the great halls from the . xlvth century to the with ( Fg . 111 ) ; in any case their usefulness and their beauty were sufficient reasons for their popularity . Artificial heat was provided by a fire on a central hearth as at Penshurst , where the smoke ascended to , and escaped from , a louvre in the roof , or by a wide chimney in the side wall . The wall fireplace had been in use even in Norman times , but for the hall the central hearth was the favoured place as late as Edward IV , who preferred it at Eltham Palace . The roof of the In some of the earlier halls , such as Stokesay , the window sills were all at a low level . // hall was generally a magnificent piece of carpentry , in one span from wall to wall . Occasionally it was aisled like the Guildhall , York ( Fig. 125 ) and the Norman halls at Oakham and Westminster . The latter was altered by Richard II , and roofed in one span , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used , Before this a type of truss had been employed , formed of a moulded tie beam or collar supporting a king post in the centre , with curved braces connecting the various members . Ln the xivth century there are numerous examples of trusses which appear to be great timber arches across the hall as at St. Cross ( Fig. 113 ) . Later the main tie beam was replaced by short horizontal beams ( hammer beams ) projecting from the walls , from which the arched braces were carried to collars , higher up in the roof ( Fig. 90 ) . In many ancient houses the roof timbers may be the only recognisable survivals of the original fabric , nor are they found without search , for they are often hidden behind modern walls and ceilings . The doors and windows of a medieval house vary in elaboration according to the design , the details being similar , however , to those met with in churches , except that they are usually simpler in character . Windows in medieval domestic architecture are frequently of two lights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 126 ) and the xiiith century Old Hall , Owre Moyne , Dorset ( Fig. 118 ) . In the last example are shown the stone seats on each side of the window that were provided when the windows were within reach of the floor . Where tracery occurs it is generally of a simple type , and transome bars are met with before they came into general use in Church building ( see Old Grange , Broadway , Fig. 123 ) . Shutters were provided in place of glass in early days . Wall-fireplaces in the xiiith and xivth centuries had large stone hoods projecting into the room with side supports or corbels . In the xvth century the hood disappeared and two arch stones were used , or massive stone lintels cut in the shape of a four-centred arch , often with a band of traceried panels , carved above them , the stone sides of the fireplace continuing the mouldings of the arch as far as an ornamental stop . Timber-framed buildings are common all over England , and were formed of large oak posts and beams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of practically // equal width , from which we get the terms " post and panel , " and " half timber . " The upper storeys of the side chambers which flanked the hall frequently overhung the lower , with big corner posts below forming bracket-like supports . The typical small yeoman 's house or cottage of the period can be recognised by a centre portion , originally open to the roof ( the hall ) , and two wings with overhanging stories , on each side , between which the eaves are supported by two large curved braces ( see Link Farm , Egerton , Fig. 127 ) . One of these wings contamed the " solar " or " bower " ? the private sleeping chamber , and the other a room over the kitchen at the lower end of the hall . The old entrance will be found invariably at one or other end of the central part of the building . The internal fittings of medieval houses have in so many instances disappeared that we shall find it easier to visualise them by the similar arrangements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be treated in a later part of this work . But we may yet see a number of interesting buildings // throughout the country which reflect the social life before the Reformation . Attached to the manor house , beside the gatehouses , private chapels , * etc. , were the great barns for storing grain , and the columbarium or dovecote , which housed the pigeons that formed a staple article of diet . The barn roofs were built on the same principle as an aisled hall , but the timbers were seldom moulded or carved ( see Fig. 130 ) . Externally they sometimes had buttresses to give greater strength to the roof trusses ( Fig. 110 ) , and cross roofs to allow carts to enter . The dovecotes were square , circular or polygonal , roofed in pyramid or conical shape , the nests being formed by a honeycomb treatment of large blocks of chalk inside ( Fig. 129 ) . Every town and village was furnished with a cross in the market place . There , on the steps , farm produce was bought and sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This resulted in some beautiful designs , such as that re-built at Shepton Mallet ( Fig. 109 ) , and those still to be seen at Salisbury , Chichester and Malmesbury ( Fig. 5 ) . Of the earlier crosses without shelters there are many delightful varieties from the simple lantern form at Ampney Crucis to the Eleanor Crosses , of which Geddington is the best remaining example . // The development of the towns , first as trading centres where markets were held , and later as corporate communities , came about very largely through merchants and other people com bining to form companies to assist the particular object they had in view . We do the same thing to-day , but our " societies " are more loosely organized than the city companies and the trade and religious guilds of the Middle Ages . These had a distinct and corporate character with a licence or charter . They clothed their masters and wardens in special robes , possessed chains of office , built themselves halls and enjoyed an elaborate ceremonial . The Guildhall , where representatives of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civic government was born of local trade regulations . The Guildhall 148 of London , St. Mary 's Hall , Coventry , and the halls at York ( Fig. 125 ) , and Kings Lynn are good examples of this last development , while the many halls of the city companies , and the wool and other halls in various parts of the country , belonged to special organizations . The village moot hall was often raised on stone columns or oak posts , to serve as a covered market below , and above it was sometimes a school room as at Barking , Essex . Among the public buildings were the hospitals which formed an important medieval institution . St. Mary 's , Chichester , shows us what a xiiith century hospital was like , with its infirmary hall and chapel , the latter provided with stalls and a beautiful screen ( Figs. 121 and 122 ) . There were also School buildings , such as the Grammar School at Norwich , and Blundell 's School at Tiverton , and Almshouses like those of St. Cross , Winchester , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor . In Wayside Chapels , like Houghton le Dale ( Norfolk ) and Chapel Plaister ( Wilts ) , and the very beautiful bridges of the medieval period , which were also often provided with chapels ( e.g. , Bradford-on-Avon ( Fig. 131 ) , Huntington and St. Neot 's ) , the details of the architecture are full of interest . In the category of medieval town and village buildings // the inn must not be forgotten ( Fig. 132 ) , nor the mills that marked the hill-slopes and the streams . Both mine host and the miller were men of substance to be reckoned with in the early communities . In the busy towns and even in the villages , the relics of many centuries ago are too often mutilated , or so changed by later usage that it is difficult to appreciate their original form and function . Yet the task of recognizing in their fragmentary form the beauty of their first design is a fascinating one , and the student will learn most who discovers for himself and lets the work of the craftsmen teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay our foundations well if we are to raise any useful structure of knowledge . Local explanations and tradi tion must be ruthlessly dissected and examined , and the architectural evidence must be related carefully to proved facts of medieval life . Our forefathers were simple , practical folk , and their powers as artists and craftsmen were devoted to practical ends . There is the less need for false romance and fabricated history to stimulate interest where the evidences of fact have a beauty and significance greater than any fiction . // excellently planned , with their several apartments grouped around the cloister , dependent on the church on one side and the frater or dining hall on the other . They were remarkably consistent and the only serious variations are to be found in the Carthusian order , where the monks lived in cells surrounding the great cloister , and in the orders of Friars , where everything was subservient to the preaching church . There were other corporate buildings in the Middle Ages , such as the halls of the merchant and religious guilds , colleges like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the Hospital of St. Cross , Winchester . Supplied with their halls , chapels and ranges of ancillary rooms , these approximated sometimes to the arrangement of the larger private houses and sometimes to that of a moderate sized monastic house , with such additional accommodation as their special requirements asked . The quadrangle , duplicated if necessary , governed the lay-out , and a gatehouse of proper dignity marked the point of access from without . The Tudor period was a practical age , and introduced an air throughout of the domination of the practical requirements of building which held the artist in check . Earlier work had been admirably suited to its purpose , but the builder had used it to express the loftiest ideas of which he was capable . Now the artist 's sphere was limited to the out22 COLLEGIATE BUILDING standing features , and the long ranges of sober apartments , showing a repetition of the plainest windows and doors , pleasant in texture though they may be , are all pitched in an obviously minor key . The practical sense of the Tudors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused them to introduce a chamber over the domestic hall , which henceforward , except in mansions and colleges , was reduced to a substantial room on the ground floor only . The Colleges of Oxford and Cambridge , both those founded and extended at this time , present us with some of the best work of the first half of the with century , and emphasize the importance of Gate , Hall and Chapel in the composition of their quadrangles ( Fig. 22 ) . The magnificent chapel which Henry VI commenced at King 's College , Cambridge , was completed by Henry vii , and the screen , which is unsurpassed in this country at least , was executed by Henry VIII 's Italian craftsmen . The characteristic form of the collegiate Chapel which may already be seen in Henry V1 's foundation at Eton ( Fig. 4 ) was a T plan , being the eastern two-thirds of a cruciform church . The cross building or antechapel was completed at Eton in 1482 . It will be seen that this building has octagonal turrets at the angles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build staircase and other projections in this manner to break with their vertical lines the flat surface of the wall . Oriel windows ( generally part of an octagon ) , corbelled out over gates , or carried down to the ground , and external chimney-stacks are also common and serve a similar purpose . The street front of Wolsey 's great foundation of Christ Church , Oxford , has octagonal towers at its extremities , and the Gate , over which is now Wren 's Tom Tower , is flanked with elaborate turrets . The same features are prominent in both St. John 's and Christ 's Colleges , Cambridge , founded by Lady Margaret , mother of Henry vii ( Fig. 15 ) . If these are mere accidents of planning , formed to meet a utilitarian need , they are very happy ones , and help to build up unconsciously the picturesque and fortuitous grouping which links the age so strongly with medieval art . The very promptings of necessity expressed themselves by habit in a contour and skyline that never fail to charm the eye . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played by the monasteries in the development of domestic architecture , and during the reigns of Henry vii and Henry viii , before their dissolution , they assisted still further . It was part of the reproach // of their enemies that the abbots and priors lived luxuriously , and certain it is that the lodgings of the heads of the religious houses were in numerous cases enlarged or rebuilt within a few years of their extinction . In the houses of the Abbots of Thame , Waltham , Forde , Muchelney , and Notley and of the priors of Castle Acre and Much Wenlock were to be found some of the most beautiful work of the period . It is not surprising that when the monastic buildings were sold or given to Henry 's supporters , the latter preserved these lodgings to form the nucleus of the houses they built upon the site . Contemporary with them were the great palaces of Nonsuch , Hampton Court , Whitehall and mansions like Layer Marney , Thornbury , Hengrave , Sutton Place , and Cowdray , the courtyard of which ( Fig. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Layer Marney ( its gatehouse alone standing ) and Sutton Place are both adorned with Italian motives in terra-cotta ; but the Abbot 's lodging at Thame is a thoroughly English example of the homely building of the time ( Fig. 28 ) . Here can be seen the type of mullioned window that was adapted from " perpendicular " models and was suited equally well for deep bays or oriels and for ordinary lights . The simple parapet , the long roof , the squat square tower , are all characteristic of the style , but we miss the combination of gable and tall chimney stack which can be seen at Grafton and Huddington Manors ( Figs. 31 and 3 ) . At Thame the forms in use are so simple that it is by the flavour of the design as a whole that we can recognise its relationship with the medieval work from which it has sprung . In other examples such as the porch of Clifton Maybank , re-erected on the entrance front of Montacute House , there is evidently a greater debt to the past . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will be seen to incorporate not a few details of classical origin , which are set quite happily in their unusual background and betray no trace of inappropriateness . It is in the brick and timber buildings that we find most clearly the easy transition from the old to the new . From Edward tv 's reign to that of Henry viii a great development of brick building took place , reflected in the stately piles of Tattershall , Hurst monceux , Caistor , Faulkbourne , Hatfield ( Old Palace ) , Oxburgh , Hadleigh , Layer Marney , Hampton Court , and Sutton Place , where Gothic detail in many fanciful forms persisted even to 1542 ( at Great Cressingham ) , and where a delightful assortment of classical ornaments were tried as embellishments to the beautiful texture of the walls . And from north to south new structures of // massive oak like Moreton Hall , Old Surrey Hall , Alston Court , Rufford Old Hall , Ordsall , Agecroft , Speke and Crowhurst , carried on the tradition of medieval carpentry , improving it by making their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exuberant use of material and by their rich garments of new carving , classic and Gothic motives mingling in riotous collusion . It was some time before classical details went further than the decoration , but it is clear from their frequency that these new forms had a fascination for people whom the new learning was beginning to reach . Their novelty was an attraction long before the principles of classical design were understood and their inclusion in the decorative scheme was no doubt a mark of fashion . The scribes had already in Henry NIA 's reign shown the way as may be seen in the Alciston Rental ( Fig. 17 ) Both Wolsey and Henry VIII invited foreign artists to this country to execute the finer parts of their buildings . The most celebrated of these craftsmen was Torregiano , who carried out the beautiful bronze tombs of Henry vu and his queen , and of Margaret , Countess of Richmond , his mother ( Fig. 27 ) . Torregiano also produced a fine tomb in stone and terra-cotta to Dr. Young , Master of the Rolls ( now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Italian in conception . A more elaborate memorial even than these was executed for Wolsey by Benedetto da Rovezzano , which after the Cardinal 's fall was altered for the King , but was not used until its sarcophagus ( which alone survives ) was employed in a later age as part of Nelson 's tomb in St. Paul 's . It has been suggested that Benedetto and his companions carved the unrivalled screenwork at King 's College , Cambridge , and certain it is that foreign artists must have produced the decoration at Nonsuch Palace , the panel of arms and terra-cotta medallions at Hampton Court and the arabesques and amorini at Sutton Place . But much similar work must have been by native artists who proved themselves fully able to interpret and apply classical ornament . The pendants to the roof of Hampton Court ( page iv ) were carved by one Richard Ridge , and the exquisite panels in the Abbots ' Parlour at Thame , grouped as they are over the Tudor linenfold panelling , may well be native work ( Fig. 29 ) . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms of the shields in use in the time of Henry vtit . Italy was not the only source of inspiration ; much can be traced to the France of Francois t , and Holbein on his visit to Sir Thomas More at Chelsea , probably designed the curious capitals in the More Chapel . He is credited with several other works , including the Gateway named after him at Whitehall and another gate at Wilton . Carving and enrichment like that on the screens at Oxburgh and St. Cross ( Figs. 8 and 7 ) abound in every nook and corner of the country ; the spandrels of the four-centred arches over doors and chimney-pieces contain shields and foliage of the Tudor type , roses , dragons and initials linked with knots of ribbon . The foliage carved on beams was an imitation of folded ribbon with leaves entwined ( Figs. 24-5 ) , and the varied types of monsters contrast curiously with the Italian arabesques . Badges such as the rose and portcullis are common , and beautiful forms of crowns , such as mingle with the other emblems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Westminster Abbey ( Fig. 1 ) . Throughout the Tudor period there is evidence that the craftsmen were not yet controlled , as we understand that control under the Renaissance architects . A man 's requirements shaped themselves in the course of building ; the result was unpremeditated and followed spontaneously on traditional lines . But while his needs dictated the plan , and the building grew as that plan developed , the craftsmen 's fancy adorned it after both the old and the new manner , and still under little compulsion or restraint . // // HENRY VIII 'S death in 1547 , brings us to within three years of the middle of the with century . Thenceforward architecture in England takes a more definitely classical form . With the assimilation of symmetry in plan , regularity of " frontispiece " ( as the elevation used to be called ) and the acceptance of the classical " orders " ( columns and the entablature above them ) , came also a change in the quality of the design and especially of the decoration . The Tudor craftsman had simplified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its old structural significance . The atonement for this loss which he made , lay in his retention of much of the early picturesque grouping of features and in his introduction of ornamental detail drawn from French and Italian sources . But when the full classical equipment came into use , the actual forms came from another source , that of the Low Countries , where the Renaissance had already acquired a somewhat coarse and heavy character in marked contrast with the light delicacy of the modes of Southern Europe . It was perhaps a reaction against // the plainness of Tudor building and an unconscious reversion to the taste for heavier mouldings and those more strongly marked features which had made medieval architecture so suitable for ouai sombre climate . The reign of Elizabeth was a period of extraordinary activity in house building and there are thousands of examples which , if they show little trace of change on the outside , are yet clearly differentiated from their fore-runners . For wherever ornament is added , or some ambitious effect sought , the features tend to grow more pronounced until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ xviith century . And especially is this so inside the house , which was richly furnished with everything that an eager craftsmanship could provide . The finer elements of proportion are often missing in the vigorous and picturesque work of the period ; nevertheless we are captivated by the whole-hearted enthusiasm for an art , Which , if it was not entirely mastered , yet was sufficiently guided and persuaded into compositions exceedingly pleasant , and consonant with our native domesticity . In an earlier chapter on church architecture we suggested that the smaller buildings are often a more fruitful source of study than those that , by reason of their size or by their supremacy as works of art , have become famous . The same applies to domestic building and we shall find a surer guide to the architectural tendencies of the time in the manor-house and cottage , than in the large mansions that owed their form to the caprice of owner or architect . The latter undoubtedly led the way and influenced the // lesser building , but the smaller houses are more constant and reflect more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We shall treat of the major building in the next chapter , and will try here to gain some familiarity with the vernacular style of Elizabeth and the two first Stuart kings . It will be convenient to class the houses and cottages according to materials used , ( i ) timber and plaster , ( ii ) brick , ( iii ) stone , and interline any necessary comments on plan as the occasion arises . Medieval framing ( Fig. 33 ) and much of that in use under Henry VIII , was formed of very large timbers of which the principal members were angle posts , intermediate posts , wall plates ( horizontal timbers ) , floor beams , and ( in the roof ) the trusses , that is to say , the principal timbers ' of which the chief was the tie-beam ( see diagram ) . The filling between these , namely the wall spaces , and the supports of floor and roof , were constructed of smaller timbers ( studs , joists and rafters ) , varying from 6 to 9 inches in width @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The oak uprights with their plaster or brick filling between were variously described as " post and panel " or " half-timber work , " and pre-reformation buildings can be easily distinguished by this close spacing of the timbers . Other evidence lies in the character of the mouldings worked on prominent members , and in the use // of the " king-post " truss for the roof , which is seldom found after the Tudor period . The ingenious jointing of these timbers will repay study , and search should always be made for the " assembly-marks , " letters or figures cut on the surface of the oak , to facilitate the framing together of the parts that were designed and cut to fit one another . After the Reformation the smaller timbers in the external framework occur at less frequent intervals and therefore enclose larger panels of plaster ( contrast the buildings on the left and right of the illustration of Eastington Hall , Fig. 32 ) . The single central ( king ) post , with its curved braces tends to disappear both in the roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timbers are reduced in size . There is , however , a greater freedom in the use of overhanging storeys and bay windows , the Elizabethan builder gaining the space he required , at any height above the ground floor , by the simple expedient of what he called " jutting forward , " and to this practice we owe the rather top-heavy but ultra-picturesque character of many of these oak-framed buildings . ( See Fig. 40 . ) In the late medieval period the timbers were adorned with much carving , and the houses possessed elaborate corner-posts with niches and saints carved from the solid , enriched horizontal members and pierced and foliated barge-boards to the gables with pinnacles and pendants . The Renaissance was a little more sparing in regard to this indulgence , but the corner post at Ipswich ( Fig. 39 ) shows the old idea in its new garment . In the house at Barkway illustrated in Fig. 37 , we may see the contrast which the fashion in the Home Counties exhibits with the elaborate framing so popular in the neighbourhood of Cheshire and Lancashire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall i ' the Wood , Bolton ( Fig. 45 ) is full of interest . Throughout the with and xvnnth centuries there were also those who prided themselves on the lavish architectural adornment of the outsides of their houses , as in Paul Pindar 's house in Bishopsgate , and another in Hart Street , London ( Fig. 40 ) . In these the woodcarver has been employed to exert his full powers , but he had a serious rival in the plasterer . The wider spaces between the framing formed an excellent field for a new type of ornament , and both as panels and as a complete covering for the framing , moulded plaster became very popular . This pargetting as it is called was often merely a texture applied to the plaster by a stick // or comb from which many patterns could be made , but it could be elaborated to modelling in low and high relief as in the well-known examples at Saffron Walden and Maidstone ( Fig. 38 ) , and it reaches its boldest development in buildings like Sparrow 's House , Ipswich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering the framing was to clothe it with hanging tiles , the rich tints of which are familiar to all who love the cottages of Kent and Surrey . Weather boarding was a somewhat later develop-ment and so was that curious form of geometric tiling in vogue in the southern counties , where the interlocking tiles deceive the eye with their appearance of a brick wall . The plan of an Elizabethan house is a quite logical de velopment from that of the medieval dwelling , if we remember that the hall was losing its importance and more private rooms were coming into use . The hall still remained as the chief living room but now it seldom rose the height of two storeys , but possessed rooms over it . It has not shrunk to the mere vestibule or ceremonial en-trance of the late xviiith and the xtxth centuries , but its functions as a common dining and sleeping apartment had by this time been relegated to parlours and bedrooms . The extension of plan in the Elizabethan house was very rarely obtained by increasing the area of the central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at both ends or to surround a courtyard , thus preserving a relatively narrow width to each section of the building , which was composed of rooms lighted // on both sides ( Fig. 56 ) . There was a reluctance to use passages , ' the rooms communicating one with the other , and access between the floors being arranged in the earlier houses by a number of spiral stairs , which projected from the outer wall in octagonal turrets . The Elizabethan architects developed the large wooden staircase , as we shall see later , and these were also at first selfcontained projecting chambers , carried up in the form of low towers . often with shaped lead roofs . These projecting stairs . // together with the lofty external chimneystacks , are responsible for much of the charm of the domestic architecture of the time . The principle noted above as guiding the Elizabethan plan tended to make the houses , especially those of brick and stone , of the well known shapes called H and m . Practical reasons called for an extended plan and the governing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were early influenced by the mannerisms of that home of brickwork , the Low Countries , and many Dutch and Flemish features appear , as we should expect , in East Anglia , where protestant immigrants settled and flourished . They introduced especially their varied forms of gable , from the crow-stepped form at Grafton Manor ( Fig. 31 ) which was already in use in Tudor times to the curved shapes which are still commonly known as Dutch gables ( Fig. 41 ) . Specially moulded bricks were used for the mullions and transomes of windows , and since the texture , shape and colour of the brick were always pleasing , these buildings all have great charm . The brick label moulding over the windows , so constant a feature of // Tudor work , survived for some time , but not so long as the stone label in the Cotswolds and elsewhere ( Fig. 43 ) . There was , in fact , less continuity between the brick structures of the late medieval and early Renaissance periods than those of stone and timber , a fact that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one important technical matter the old customs held their own . The bricks which were narrow ( from 2 to 21 inches ) were laid with thick mortar joints in " Old English " bond , that is to say alternate courses of long bricks ( stretchers ) and end-bricks ( headers ) . It was not until Charles it 's time , when brick building gained another great impetus , that the Flemish bond of alternate stretcher and header in every course was introduced . In the earlier work a certain number of headers may be seen introduced STONE BUILDINGS either irregularly in the stretcher courses or to form the diagonal chequer-work of dark bricks , the occurrence of which gives such piquancy to the sur face texture . Where bricks were made , it was also easy to ob 39 tarn beautiful hand made tiles ? the two products of burnt clay blend to perfection ? but thatch was for long the more popular form among the cottages of the villages and the countryside . Houses of stone are of many kinds . Where there is a fine local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " masonry , that is , stone worked to a smooth face , but even in such districts walls of " chopped stone " and rubble are not uncommon . Rubble , whether of stone or flint , makes a beautiful and durable wall , but the angles ( quoins ) of the building and the windows and door openings have to be made of worked stone or brick . The rubble set in its bed of lime mortar makes for a rich weathered texture , or it may be left rough and plastered over , a practice we have noticed in medieval buildings ( Fig. 35 ) . In any case the stone and plaster surfaces , which , no doubt had received a coat of limewash when first erected , soon weather to a beautiful colour , and if the district furnishes stone suitable for roofing , such as that of Horsham in Sussex , and Hampton in the Cotswolds , the whole building will become one with the landscape , of which it is the natural fruit . It is in the small stone houses of the with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mason , as he slowly and almost imperceptibly remodels his work on symmetrical lines , and blends with it the new forms . The classical semi-circular arch ( often in a square frame , like its Tudor predecessor ) appears here and there but does not entirely supersede the two centred pointed type . Mouldings become classical in profile , and yet a parapet or a label moulding is often modelled with an older contour . Order and
