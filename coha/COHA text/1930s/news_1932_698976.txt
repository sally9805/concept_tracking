txt No one with a spark of historical imagination can fail to be impressed by certain aspects of the Imperial Conference at Ottawa . It is a living demonstration of the peculiar and continuing power of the British Empire . Under the new title of the British Commonwealth of Nations , it . preserves much of its old prestige and glamour in holding together peoples and governments representing so vast a portion of the earth 's surface . Something of the old pomp and glitter in which Queen VICTORIA delighted may have departed from such imperial gatherings , but their true significance remains as a standing tribute to the political genius of the British race . It knows how to yield and compromise and adjust itself to the changing demands of democracy , but still manages to hold its scattered colonies and Dominions in an unforced loyalty to the mother of Parliaments and of free institutions . In its amazing vitality it may be said of the - British Empire that the more it changes , the more it remains the same thing . Because it is a world-State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so was strikingly made manifest in the speeches at the opening of the conference in Ottawa . Spokesmen for Great Britain sounded the same large note as the representatives of Canada and Australia and South Africa . " No pent-up Utica contracts their powers . " They are imperialists , but never isolationists . The fact that they wish to extend their trade with each other , and to cooperate as far as possible in forwarding every true imperial interest. , does not keep them from lifting up their eyes to behold the opportunities which invite them in their relations with outside nations . Because they are thoroughly convinced that the British Empire can not live unto itself , they turn thumbs down on the grandiose Beaverbrook scheme of free trade within the Empire and prohibitory tariffs against all the rest of the world . Even Mr. BALDWIN , who has long been a protectionist , admitted that the goal for which they must strive is lower duties as between the Dominions and the mother country , with as little discrimination as possible against the commerce of other countries . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Finance Minister of South Africa , Mr. HAVENGA . He bluntly declared that the South African Union " does not subscribe to the theory " of a self-contained and *solated " British Empire . " In fact , none of its . members , not even Great Britain , could exist solely by trade within the Commonwealth . It is true of the Dominion of Canada that her best customers are without the pale of the Empire . Australia and New Zealand and South Africa must all seek non-imperial markets . Their rulers , because they are free and because they are at liberty to speak at Ottawa for their selfgoverning peoples , make it clear from the start that they propose to deal with economic laws and realities rather than with high-sounding generalities . In the end , as/the most clear-eyed critics and economists in London have seen frofn the beginning , the hard facts of national development and manufactures and production of raw materials and Erofita.ble trade across the seas will determine what is done or left undone at Ottawa . In matters of finance , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth from the representritives of the Dominions . Mr. HAVENGA , fox example , declared himself entirely against any , newfangled or " managed " currency within the Empire . It could only work , he maintains , for greater uncertainty and instability in foreign exchanges , and therefore South Africa would have none of it . The gold standard has established its superiority as a means of settling national balances and maintaining , the currency on a secure basis , so that the thing for the various component parts of the British Empire to do is to restore the gold standard " at such parities as " the various States may find possi " ble . " This will cause great grief cto Mr. KEYNES and others of the " new " economists in England , and perhaps make them more than ever despair of the future ; but just the same it represents one of those great realities with which the Ottawa Conference is already showing its purpose resolutely to deal .                  @ @ @
