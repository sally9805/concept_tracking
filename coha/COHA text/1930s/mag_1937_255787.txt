The Moderator of the National Council of Christian &; Congregational Churches , spry , bearded old Statistician Roger Ward Babson , two months ago received a troubled letter from Rev. Theodore C. Hume of Chicago and 14 other Congregational ministers . Mr. Hume and his colleagues wanted to know if Mr. Babson had told his businessmen subscribers , in a special letter of his Babson 's Reports , that U. S. churches have accumulated " useless customs and cobwebs " ? Had he further remarked that the German Government in emphasizing a creed based on " four simple but vital foundations " ( Faith , Blood , Sacrifice , Love ) " may be taking a forward step which our churches should have taken long ago " ? <P> When Congregationalist Babson wrote Congregationalist Hume a genial , rambling affirmation of these opinions , both letters were published last month by the alert Congregationalist Advance . Babsonisms on Cobwebs : <P> " Young people seem to be especially disturbed by reference to the Virgin Birth , Physical Resurrection of the Body , the Apostles ' Creed , etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done by comparatively few able men through the radio , talking movies , and other even more revolutionary inventions . " <P> Last week the editors of the Advance announced that they had asked Mr. Babson for permission to reprint the special letter in question , received in reply an unexpectedly sour Babsonism . The Reports reminded the Moderator , were a " confidential service , " and already " some subscriber had broken faith and violated his contract in making public these statements .
