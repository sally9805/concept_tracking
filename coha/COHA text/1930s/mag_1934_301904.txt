A buxom housewife on Manhattan 's Riverside Drive posed winsomely for the photographer and said : " It ca n't be true . Oh , how wonderful ! " She pocketed a check for $10,000 . <P> A student with a Spanish name happily bared his teeth for the camera and said : " Now I can finish with my law . " He got $2,000 . <P> With her $1,000 a comely high-school girl in The Bronx wanted a raccoon coat , a big party , a college education . <P> One hundred and twenty-seven other New Yorkers got $2,665 and Publisher Julius David Stern 's struggling New York Post got 23,000 estimated net gain in circulation . <P> Thus last week ended the most flamboyant newspaper circulation contest New York City has witnessed in recent years . But even before prize winners in the first contest were announced , the Post had already embarked on a second and bigger one with $25,000 in prizes ; and the tabloids Mirror and Daily News had been drawn into the scramble with offers of $40,000 and $15,000 respectively . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Post had only 60,000 circulation when David Stern bought it from Curtis-Martin year ago . The new owner tried to change the paper from a genteel , arch-Tory organ to a rowdy New Deal standardbearer . He succeeded mainly in making it a sensational hodgepodge . By fits &; starts , the Post claimed to have 75,000 steady readers when it began its " Game of Names " contest last August . <P> Like all extended contests , the Post 's started out to be childishly , incredibly simple . The object was to choose which of several given names best fitted a cartoon drawn by John Held Jr . A new cartoon appeared every weekday for ten weeks . The person submitting the " best or most appropriate names " to the 60 drawings in the series was to get the first prize , $10,000 . However , as the contest wore on , the pictures became more and more obscure , the lists of names longer and longer , until several names seemed equally appropriate . That reduced the possibility of ties . Result : even the first prize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Post 's contest which it mentioned only in the tiniest type , was the contestant 's obligation to send 10 with every group of six pictures , or $1 for the whole contest . For each dime he would receive a print of one of the drawings , " suitable for framing . " Since some 40,000 started the contest and 30,000 saw it to a finish , the 10 rule netted the Post $33,000-a little more than double the sum paid out in prizes . That , however , did not make the contest a direct moneymaker . The Post spent $45,000 advertising its contest in other New York dailies ; $8,000 for radio advertising ; $18,000 for a special clerical force of 300 ; $11,000 for printing the drawings , " suitable for framing " ; about $5,000 to Artist Held . Total cost : $69,665 . But an increase of 23,000 in circulation so pleased Publisher Stern that he promptly ordered the new , 12-week series , with drawings by Peter Arno.
