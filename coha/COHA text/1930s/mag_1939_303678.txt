U. S. Ambassador to Japan Joseph Clark Grew is such a skillful diplomat that every time he criticizes the Japanese , they like him better . He has virtually all the qualities which a foreign emissary to Tokyo needs : seven years ' residence in the country , tall body , grey hair , dark mustache , spectacular brows , horn-rimmed glasses , sensitivity , firmness , a gentlemanly capacity for hard work and saki ( rice wine ) , good clothes , a beautiful house filled with Oriental antiques , and one deaf ear , which he knows how to turn at the right moment . <P> Whenever a U. S. Ambassador arrives in Tokyo , whether for the first time or after home leave , he is tendered a dinner of welcome by the America-Japan Society , a frequent sounding board for the two countries ' relationships . Five years ago Ambassador Grew returned to Tokyo after a furlough . The America-Japan Society 's welcoming speech was made by suave , old Viscount Kikujiro Ishii , one of Japan 's most subtle diplomats , then Privy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war between Japan and the U. S. was remote unless " the U. S. ever attempted to dominate the Asiatic continent and prevented Japan from her pacific and natural expansion in this part of the world . " Ambassador Grew rose , said he was terribly sorry that because of his deafness he had missed parts of the Viscount 's speech , but had taken notes on what he had been able to hear . Consulting them , he gave a pleasant little talk . <P> Last week Ambassador Grew was again back in Tokyo after four months at home . The America-Japan Society again gave the usual dinner . This time Joseph Grew made a speech which was not only unusual : it was virtually unprecedented in ambassadorial usage . The Ambassador gave his distinguished audience an earful which made many of them wish for deafness . He used an unofficial occasion to express an official , definitely controversial , exceedingly ticklish point of view . His words , he said , " came straight from the horse 's mouth . . . and mind you , I know whereof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Japanese are badly mistaken when they say that U. S. public opinion as to Japan 's aims is founded on misunderstanding . " The facts as they exist are accurately known by the American people . I do not suppose any country in the world today is better served by press and radio with accurate foreign information than the United States . " <P> Then the Ambassador spoke shockingly frank words . " Many of you , " he said , " are not aware of the increasing extent to which the people of the United States resent methods which Japanese armed forces are employing in China , and what appear to be their objectives . <P> " The American people regard with growing seriousness the violation and interference with American rights by Japanese armed forces in China in disregard of treaties and agreements . <P> " When such opinion tends toward unanimity , it is a force which a government can not possibly overlook and will not fail to reflect in its policies and actions .
