In Tokyo last week the Imperial Government banned as " detrimental to public peace " three of the best modern U. S. books on Japan , all written by authors who strive to be objective and praise Japan quite as often as they damn her . Excerpts from the books banned : Challenge : Behind the Face of Japan by Upton Close ( Farrar &; Rinehart , $3 ) : " Perhaps the most amusing of Japan 's new industries is the reproduction of old American heirlooms-New England furniture and such . ... It is as hard for our diplomats to converse with the Japanese foreign office as for a man to argue with a woman . <P> . . . Japanese hope of peace and understanding with the West is based upon our acknowledgment of Japan 's divine mission and acceptance of what Japanese do . . . . <P> Japan will not change . Neither will the West , which feels as justified by logic in its position as a man ' talking reason ' with a high-strung woman . . . . Nippon , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caesar , Genghiz , Charlemagne , Napoleon and Kaiser Wilhelm II failed to accomplish . " Far Eastern Front by Edgar Snow ( Smith &; Haas , $3.75 ) " A visit to India , to Japan , to the Philippines , leaves you suddenly with the conviction that in many obscure but important ways the Chinese people are far in advance of Eastern men elsewhere , and that in them ultimately and inevitably resides the cultural leadership of Asia . . . . Two years of undeclared war with Japan have not perceptibly shaken China " but if Japan succeeds in detaching Chinese Turkestan " that would complete a period of fifty years of decline , during which 3,000,000 square miles of territory had been detached from the anatomy of China . . . . <P> " To one close to realities in the East , it does not seem unlikely that China may in time unite with Japan against the West . " Japan in Crisis by Dr. Harry Emerson Wildes ( Macmillan , $2 ) : " It is certainly a libel upon Japanese womanhood to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and entitled How the Social Evil is Regulated in Japan , that ' ten percent of the female population of all ages ' is engaged in prostitution . But it is exceedingly significant that , with a press censorship as strict as that in Japan and as ready to suppress publications which are undesirable , the little red brochure is allowed to be distributed and sold . . . . <P> Because of the close alliance of the Government with the vice interests . . . one such scandal , occurring in a very recent year , involved a Premier , the heads of the three leading political parties , a governor and other Japanese officials in a million-yen bribery case . . . . <P> " Revolution is scarcely yet upon the home horizon . . . . But Japan has fallen prey to the graft , corruption and slackness that have undermined so many empires in the past . "
