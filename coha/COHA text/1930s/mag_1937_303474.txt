Active , intelligent Paul Henri Spaak Belgium 's Foreign Minister , concluded last week what has already been called " the political bargain of the century " After the Treaty of Versailles , Belgium , which for centuries had been ravaged by the wars of others , pinned her faith in collective security . Since then Belgians have seen the League fumble and haggle while Dictator Mussolini walked into Ethiopia ; they have watched Dictator Hitler 's Storm Troops calmly goosestep into the demilitarized Rhineland zone ( TIME , March 16 , 1936 ) , and France form a pact with godless Stalin ( TIME , May 13 , 1935 ) whom Belgians , most of them devout Roman Catholics , hate . More recently they have watched 27 neutral nations ignominiously fail to let Spain destroy itself unassisted . <P> Belgium , though still technically committed by the Locarno Treaties to defend Britain or France if either should be attacked , has long been ready to let the rest of Europe go hang . Handsome young King Leopold III seven months ago gave out that his country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( TIME , Oct. 26 ) , and last week that policy was fulfilled . The French and British Governments , making a virtue of necessity both agreed to release Belgium from he promise to defend Britain and France from attack , but maintained their pledge , from motives of self-interest , to fight if Belgim is invaded . Apart from being bound by the Covenant of the League of Nations , Belgium is thus virtually as " neutral " as in 1914.
