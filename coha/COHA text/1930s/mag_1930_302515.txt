In all the trade of war no feat Is nobler than a brave retreat . <P> Hudibras. - Samuel Butler <P> The retreat of Germany 's stiff-necked Dr. Hjalmar ( " Iron Man " ) Schacht at The Hague Reparations Conference last week was epic , masterful . <P> The President of the Reichsbank came upon the scene with the haughty air of a Goliath , defying not only the Allied Powers but also his own Government ( TIME , Jan. 20 ) . <P> The Conference had substantially agreed to sign forthwith the protocol of the Reparations Plan , drafted at Paris last spring under the chairmanship of Owen D. Young , by a committee of bankers of whom Dr. Schacht was one . He signed the original Paris draft of the Plan , approved the articles establishing a $100,000,000 Bank for International Settlements ( B. I. S. ) , and allowed everyone to assume that of course the Reichsbank would subscribe its allotted quota of the capital of the B. I. S. <P> Now , suddenly , and in despite of the Socialist Government of German Prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Young Plan had been so tinkered that it is no longer the document he originally signed ; second , that it would be " morally wrong " for the Reichsbank to associate itself with a plan so contrary to German interests , since it now sanctions France to act against the Fatherland in the event of German refusal to pay Reparations ; and third , that Dr. Schacht , basing his stand as he said " on the highest moral grounds , " would not as President of the Reichsbank authorize it to subscribe a single copper pfennig to the capital of the B. I. S. Dramatically nailing his colors , Dr. Schacht barked at correspondents : " I will maintain this position until I die ! " <P> State Above the State . How could the " Iron Man " possibly retreat without losing face after that ? How dared he challenge the whole Conference ? What did the irate German Socialist press-such as Die Welt am Montag-mean when they accused him of being " the head not only of a state within the State but of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dr. Schacht lies in the fact that the President of the Reichsbank is chosen for the inordinately long term of ten years , and is answerable during that time neither to the Reichstag , the Prime Minister nor the President of the Republic . Stiff-necked Dr. Schacht was appointed in 1923 . Thus his term will not be up until 1933 . Paradoxically the Allied Powers , whom he was challenging last week , themselves insisted on this arrangement in 1924 , when the Dawes Plan was adopted . They feared that if German politicians could depose the head of the Reichsbank they might do so , and appoint a man who would wreck the Dawes Plan . Evidently last week Dr. Schacht thought he had the Allies cleverly hoist by their own petard . <P> Curtius v. Schacht . Chief of the German Delegation at The Hague last week was Foreign Minister Dr. Julius Curtius , successor to the late , great Stresemann , and a comparative tyro at diplomacy . He had asked Dr. Schacht to come on from Berlin as a financial expert , found him suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
