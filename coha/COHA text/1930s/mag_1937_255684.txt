Crowded out by President Roosevelt 's Supreme Court shocker ( see p. 16 ) and the fateful automobile strike in Flint and Detroit ( see below ) , the Great Flood of 1937 seeped off the nation 's front pages last week . But for a half-million people along the lower Mississippi it was still prime news . From Cairo , Ill. to New Orleans an army of 125,000 reliefers , convicts and volunteers worked feverishly to raise and strengthen the thousand-mile , billion-dollar levee system which stood between them and disaster . The levees were still holding as the hump in the river 's back reached Memphis at week 's end . High wind or heavy rain might still send the swollen river roaring through and over them . It was going to be an anxious three weeks until the worst U. S. flood rolled out into the Gulf and history. * <P> *For flood curiosities , see p. 66.
