" The roof just lifted up . Then the walls fell out and the roof fell in , " said William C. Shaw , the superintendent . " It sounded like dynamite , " said a boy named Barber on the football team . ' ' It blew up like a tin can with a firecracker inside it , " said an oil field worker . Across the plains for miles around , horrified observers on shanty porches , at oil derricks , in automobiles , thought of a hurricane , an earthquake , a battle , as at 3:05 last Thursday afternoon the high-school wing of the Consolidated School at New London , Tex. , suddenly blew to pieces . <P> Consolidated School educates all the 1,500 children in the sprawling , oil-soaked school districts of London and New London . The primary grades had already been dismissed . But there were 690 boys and girls and 40 teachers still in the spreading story-and-a-half high-school wing . They would have been dismissed in ten minutes , when something , almost certainly natural gas from the bowels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and teachers were instantly blown , crushed , torn to death . <P> Paula Echols , 15 , was in an English class with 20 other students when she saw the building shake and the roof fall in . Then Paula saw her teacher 's leg protruding from a rumbling pile of brick and mortar . Pinned beneath her desk , Paula heard the boy across the aisle screaming for help . Another boy dragged her out through the window-frame . <P> In the manual arts shop in the basement , John Nelson , 17 , was working on a lathe . His teacher was standing about five feet away . There were 15 other boys in the room . Then a big mass of sand and what looked like a ball of fire tumbled in . Something hit John Nelson 's leg and slit the front of his pants . It felt " like a charley horse you get playing football . " <P> Standing by the window in a fifth-grade classroom upstairs was John Nelson 's brother Don , a 24-year-old oil worker who was watching over his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise . Plaster started falling . He thought for a split second of the window . Then two or three of the children started running toward him . He herded them out into the open fast . Out in the schoolyard , Don Nelson saw the ground littered with bodies . Two men ran up to him and they crawled back into the ruins together . A heavy bookcase had formed a cave from under which ten pale children scampered . " There was so much confusion , " said Don Nelson , " I ca n't remember much about the screaming . " <P> But there was screaming . In a moment oil field workers shut off the pumps under their derricks and came running toward the pile . Fathers and mothers , 100 of whom had been attending a meeting of the Parent-Teachers ' Association in the school gymnasium , rushed up white-faced . From the shining school buses lined up to take them home tumbled scores of scared kindergarten moppets to help dig under the debris from which appalling screams and cries could be heard . Slowly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had stretched , at the first count , 220 corpses on the ground . Many had been killed so quickly , by the force of the concussion , that there were still smiles on their white faces . More had been twisted and disfigured . Everywhere there were shoes , caps , shreds of clothing , schoolbooks.
