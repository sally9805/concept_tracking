txt Every few months Mr. GEORGE N. PEEK is certain to emerge excited and alarmed by some new rearrangement he has made of figures long ago published by the Department of Commerce . The lack of novelty in the figures is more than atoned for by the striking novelty of his interpretations . Mr. PEEK apparently can not look at our foreign trade figures for any year without finding something vaguely ominous in them . No matter what they show , it somehow always turns out that cunning foreigners are getting the better of us . Our foreign trade last year seems to have been particularly unfortunate . One metropolitan newspaper carried Mr. PEEK 'S latest table under the caption , " $970,000,000 Deficit in U. S. Trade Balance , " another under the headline " U. S. Losing Huge Sums in Trade War . " How can such things be ? Consulting Mr. PEEK 'S table , we find the following : During 1934 we sold to the world goods in the amount of $2,133,000,000 We bought from the world goods in the amount of 1,655,000,000 Thereby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of 478,000,000 This does not look like a deficit . Neither does it look like one when Mr. PEEK 'S table goes on to show that as a result of the balance of so-called " invisible " items there was a balance owed to us by the world for goods , services , interest and dividends of $831 , - 000,000 . But there is where the Peekian interpretation comes in . It appears that , in the language of the table , we " bought " gold in the net amount of $1,217,000,000 , and this , together with silver and paper currency , amounted to $1,351,000,000 , thereby " placing us in " debt to the world in the amount of " $970,000,000 . " This , of course , is one way of putting it . When a storekeeper sells $5 worth of goods , he can say , if he wishes , that he " bought " $5 from the customer . When the customer pays him back $9.70 of a total debt of some $178 , he can say  --  though it would begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been thereby placed in " debt " to the customer by $9.70 . Mr. PEEK proceeds to draw some strange inferences . Last September he was disturbed by the fact that we had loaned so much abroad . He then laid down the indisputable proposition that " our national assets will be di " minished by the amount of this debt " which is not paid . " Now he is apparently disturbed by the fact that last year $970,000,000 of the debt was bought back . He never raises the question of to what extent this amount represented the repatriation of American funds that had gone out in the flight of capital in 1933 . Nor does it occur to him that when foreigners bought back $732,000,000 of their own securities here they paid for them with funds that gave added purchasing power to Americans to buy American goods . It would be heartless to begrudge Mr. PEEK his modest salary of $12,000 a year and his impressive title of Special Adviser to the President on Foreign Trade . But the official prestige which this gives to his extraordinary interpretations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his constant warfare against the trade policies of Secretary Hum , and Secretary WALLAcE must inevitably weaken the Administration 's hand .
