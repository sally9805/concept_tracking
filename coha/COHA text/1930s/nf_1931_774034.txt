Even had any group of wage earners then succeeded in raising its wages , it could not have stemmed the tide of general price decline . We can , therefore , more reasonably think of wage and price changes as being , in the main , joint effects of a common cause , than as being , either , the cause of the other . If wage increases can ever be a cause of price increases , this must probably be when hank reserves are in excess and when credit expansion is , therefore , easily possible . Under such conditions it is quite conceivable that demands for higher wages might , lead to larger loans from banks to employers and that the increased money and credit so cir culating would operate to raise prices . But it is also con ceivable that increased wage bills of their customers would in some cases cause hankers to fear that these customers would lose money , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in smaller amounts than before . Also , in case hunk reserves are in excess , it is at least pos sible , if not probable , that loans would be expanded and prices rise in equal degree whether or not wages in any line were advanced first . In the long run the demands of wage earners are quite likely not to influence in any con siderable degree the ratio of bank reserves to loans or to deposits . And , certainly , such demands can hardly in-crease credit and raise prices when bank reserves are not in excess of requirements . A demand of wage earners for higher wages probably would not appreciably , if at all , increase the velocity of circulation of money . It would not decrease , appreciably , the output of goods for any long period , since wage earners can not afford to remain long idle . It would not usually , if ever , increase bank // loans and the volume of bank deposit accounts . It could not , therefore , be a significant force in raising prices . ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a locomotive , an automobile , an airplane or an ocean steamship is never the invention entirely of a single mind but is the result of a long series of inventions and discoveries going back , in some cases , before the dawn of history . The institution of commercial banking is a great , immaterial machine , the product of the thinking and experience of many minds , and having its origin centuries ago . Through its aid the funds of persons who , temporarily but for indeterminate periods , do not desire to use their funds , are placed at the disposal of borrowers , to the mutual advantage of borrowers and ultimate lenders . Through its aid we carry on the major part ? in the United States not less than ninety per cent ? of business without the transfer of money , becoming successively creditors of the borrowers from the banks . We become creditors of the borrowers from banks , by accepting , for goods and services , checks on the banks and so becoming depositors of the banks ; and , as depositors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upon repayment to the banks , by borrowers , of the sums borrowed . The checking accounts or claims on banks thus passed from person to person by check , act on prices as does money . They are a money substitute . They constitute a large part of the media of exchange . But their volume is related to the volume of money . Bank deposits can not too much exceed cash reserves . The ratio of bank reserves to bank deposits depends , in the United States , on the policy of the Federal Reserve Board and , ultimately , on the law which fixes minimum reserve requirements . Checking accounts and cash in tills or pockets tend to maintain a rough proportion to each other because certain things are more conveniently paid for by check and other things are conveniently , and by custom , paid for with money . // This fact , as well as the necessity of a cash reserve for banks , tends to relate the volume of bank deposits to the volume of money .

Rising and falling prices are to be explained by reference to the relations between money and credit media of exchange on the one hand and the volume of trade on the other . The notion that rising prices are due to , or that they can be caused by , demands for higher wages on the part of wage earners is , except for some minor and , indeed , very dubious qualifications , utterly preposterous , despite the extent to which this notion has been accepted . In concluding this chapter it may be helpful to emphasize the very great influence which can be exercised over the general price level by the twelve Federal Reserve banks . They can force credit restriction upon member ( and other ) banks even though these banks and their customers owe the Federal Reserve banks nothing . For by selling , in the open market , securities held in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various banks . These checks are then charged against such banks , forcing settlement from non-members and , in the case of member banks , diminishing their credit balances ( which count as their reserves ) in the various Federal Reserve banks . Thus , both member and non-member banks must restrict credit and prices tend downward . And , on the other hand , by purchasing eligible securities in the open market , the Federal Reserve banks can put more money and checking accounts into circulation , increase the reserves and the lending power of member banks and cause the price level to rise .

Summary . ? 1 . Stages of the Business Cycle ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and price levels , of the effects of changing quantities of money and money sub stitutes , and of some of the characteristic features of bank ing , has prepared us for a consideration of the phenomena of business cycles . The so-called business cycle includes business depression , business revival , prosperity , and crisis ? sometimes panic ? , leading to another depression . Business is always in one or another of these stages , and widely-known students of the theory of business cycles contend that each such stage is but an avenue to the stage next in order . ' In this view , the successive stages are not departures from a standard volume of business which is regarded as " normal " but are themselves a normal and to-be-expected series of occurrences . Normality is thought of as consisting of ceaseless change . This opinion does not involve the belief that crises and depressions are desirable or even that they are inevitable . Nor does the fact of ceaseless change in business conditions mean that we may not predicate an average condition as a hypothetical norm above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does suggest a doubt whether conditions approxi mate this norm for any longer consecutive period in the 83 // cycle than they approximate the extreme of activity or the extreme of depression . Several business factors show fluctuations in the successive stages of the business cycle . The amount of money in circulation tends to increase and then to decrease in relation to the amount held in bank reserves . The volume of bank deposits subject to check tends to increase and then to decrease in relation to reserves . The amount of employment in relation to population tends to increase and later to decrease . Stocks of goods on hand tend to grow larger and afterwards to grow smaller . The general level of prices tends first to rise and afterwards to fall . Wages go up and then go down . Wholesale and retail prices , prices of finished goods and prices of raw material change first in one way in relation to each other and then in the opposite way . Rentals , hank rates of discount , and long time interest also go through similar fluctuations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light of what has been just stated regarding the nature of the business cycle , it would appear that we can best account for the facts of the cycle not so much by looking to some extraneous influence as by considering the conditions of each stage as probably causally connected with the immediately preceding and with the immediately succeeding stage . With this point of view we may choose as a starting point any stage in business and attempt to trace the sequence causally through the succeeding stages to the end of a complete cycle . We shall choose for our starting point the stage of business depression . Hence we must provide ourselves with a characterization of this stage . Business depression , as the business man knows it , is primarily a condition of disinclination to purchase . Each business man is anxious to make sales . Each would , of course , welcome purchases by others of him . But each is afraid , himself , to make purchases from others . The // psychology of the situation seems to be that each person hesitates to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a profit ; and the reason why each finds it difficult so to sell is that others hesitate to buy . So , also , manufacturers and other employers hesitate to employ their usual number of operatives and other laborers at current rates of wages , lest the output should prove unsalable at a profit . The difficulty is not , it should be emphasized , that goods absolutely can not be sold . If they were offered at prices low enough , all goods produced could be sold very easily under almost any conceivable conditions of business . To make our argument convincing let us suppose , as an extreme case , that , despite the existence of a large stock of money and a large volume of bank deposit accounts subject to check , the manufacturers of shoes were willing to offer them at ten cents a pair ! Would shoes then be unsalable ? Or suppose that all wage earners would consent to work for wages of ten cents a day ! Would there then be unemployment ? The question may indeed be asked , whether it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pairs of shoes with ten-cent wages as ten-dollar pairs of shoes with ten-dollar wages . The point is , however , that such a lower general scale of prices would at once increase greatly to any person who might have any money on hand or any available checking accounts , the advantage of spending such money or accounts . And , with prices so low , a much smaller proportionate spending of current funds than at higher prices would suffice to purchase all goods on the market and to employ all available labor . For we are surely not to suppose that lower prices with the same volume of money and checking accounts on hand would so reduce the amounts expended as to prevent purchases from increasing ! Only as reduction of prices generates an expectation of still further future reduction and so provides a motive for the temporary deferring of expenditure will // purchases fail to increase.2 In any case a sufficient reduc tion of prices can not but bring ? and that , soon ? an increase of purchases . For it could not but become ob vious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not be expected . And the amount of potential purchasing power that people will hold indefinitely idle is not in-definitely large . People want money to spend and not , ordinarily at least , to hoard . And even although there may be some who want money to hoard , the per cent of such persons of hoarding disposition will hardly be larger without limit just because prices are lower . If we assume , then , any definite limit whatever , however remote , to hoarding , we are forced to the conclusion that there must be some level of prices low enough to dispose of all goods produced and to employ all labor . It may , indeed , be objected by some critics even yet , that many persons are of a saving disposition and that even a fall of prices may not induce such persons to buy for their consumption much more than before . But whether this is the case or not has no special significance . For persons who save nevertheless spend as effectively as those who are extravagant . They may not buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines , brick and stone for building , orchards , railroad bonds and shares , and other goods , the purchase of which is as truly an in-direct demand for labor as is the purchase of food , clothing , flowers and theatre tickets . To suppose , then , that a fall of prices will not increase trade is to suppose , not only that lower prices will have no effect in increasing consump tion but also that they will have no effect in increasing the purchase of investment goods . Our conclusion would seem to be that there need never be business inactivity or depression if only prices could become sufficiently low , if sellers of goods of all sorts and // of labor would accept prices low enough so that the diminished dollars-expenditure of a low-spending period would nevertheless buy all available supplies of goods as rapidly as the goods could be put upon the market . An era of depression , then , is not so much a period when business could not go on if prices , wages , rentals and interest charges were low enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the disinclination to purchase ? at existing prices , wages , etc. ? is contemporaneous with unwillingness of would-be sellers to accept sharp reductions in their prices , rentals or other charges ; it is therefore a period when the amount of business actually done is small . When it is asserted that a sufficiently lower range of prices , interest charges , rentals and wages would make possible active business , there is no implication that such a lower range would necessarily deprive any class of persons of their customary incomes measured in the goods which money can buy , ? of their customary rent , interest , or wages . The wage earner , for instance , need not be injured by a wage reduction if with it goes a lower cost of living . The employer need not be injured by lower gross returns if all of his business expenses are also lower in like degree . The creditor need not be injured by lower interest if his smaller interest return will buy as much as a larger return would buy at higher prices . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be injured even by receiving a smaller amount of money as repayment of his principal if this smaller amount of money has a correspondingly larger purchasing power per unit over investment goods . Thus , if a man is a creditor for $10,000 , he will be as well off as before to receive but $5,000 on the due date if meanwhile the prices of investment and other goods ? e.g. a farm and a factory which he may contemplate purchasing ? fall by half . No opinion is expressed at this point , regarding what is a desirable distribution of wealth among different persons or classes . It is here asserted merely // that a general readiness to accept low money prices and incomes would , in case of threatened business depression , enable business to be carried on as actively as usual , and that , therefore , the chief characteristic of depression is a general unwillingness to hire , buy and borrow at prevailing prices and rates . The other characteristics of business depression are , many of them at least , consequences of or implied in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circulation of money and bank deposits in such a period , is low . But to say this is to repeat in other words that there is a hesitancy to spend . Funds which might be spent for stocks of goods , for raw materials or to hire labor , are kept idle . Again , bank deposits and money in circulation outside of banks are apt to be less in volume during depression than in the previous period of prosperity . This is a consequence of the disinclination to buy and hire and , therefore , of the disinclination to borrow . Merchants and manufacturers have relatively small deposits subject to check and of money for pay rolls because , not wanting to buy large stocks of goods or of raw materials or to hire considerable numbers of operatives , they do not have occasion to borrow largely from the banks . This disinclination to spend current funds and to borrow funds from banks for spending , brings both lessened trade and lower prices . We have already seen that it need not bring lessened trade if sellers were universally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficiently great to carry off of the market all goods , including labor , despite the diminution in the number of dollars expended which characterizes depression . But there are various customary notions of what are reasonable prices for various goods and reasonable wages for labor of various kinds and , furthermore , each person hopes to be able to get the old price or the old wage for what he has to sell and does not want to reduce until sure that his expenses will also be reduced . // And so there is a general hesitancy , a holding off for standard prices , wages , and so on , to the inevitable slowing down of business . Nevertheless , prices , wages , etc. do fall , and their relative lowness is ordinarily one of the characteristics of a period of business depression . The reason is that the inability to sell goods and labor finally forces the acceptance , however reluctant , of lower prices and wages . The period of hesitancy in buying comes to express itself , therefore , not entirely in slack business and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each . At this point we may profitably revert to the relation of prices to the quantity of money and the volume of bank credit . No theory of prices can be accepted as perfect and complete which makes the price level depend upon the quantity of money or upon the quantity of money and bank deposits without reference to the general readiness to spend or hesitancy in spending . An increased quantity of money can not raise prices if the whole of the increase is hoarded . It is true beyond any reasonable doubt that to increase the amount of money will cause more to be spent in the aggregate than if the quantity were not increased . Nevertheless , there has usually been a rhythm from prosperity to depression and back to prosperity which has been , in large part , a rhythm in the readiness to spend money and bank deposits as contrasted with hoarding or keeping them idle , and this rhythm we can not afford to overlook . From decade to decade , or from a given stage in one business cycle to the corresponding stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to changes in mining conditions and to government issues or withdrawals of paper money and changes in the volume of bank credit due to increased or decreased use of banks and to fluctuating reserve requirements or policies , are matters of considerable economic significance . But from one phase of a business cycle to another phase of the same cycle , changes // in the readiness with which people spend are perhaps of equal and possibly of greater significance . The decreased readiness to spend which characterizes business depression appears to be less markedly the result of a decreased willingness to buy consumption goods than it is of a decreased willingness on the part of business men to buy production goods and stocks of goods for sale . And while the fall of wages and the decrease of employment do actually operate to decrease consumption as well as production , yet stocks of goods in stores and stocks of raw materials held in reserve by manufacturers are probably reduced ( luring the period of dullness to a relatively low point . The falling off in demand for goods during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more a fall of demand by business men for business purposes than by consumers for personal purposes . So far as the latter decrease of demand does come it is probably , in large part , an enforced consequence of the former . Hence , decreased stocks of goods may be regarded as a characteristic of the later part of depression . Another characteristic of depression is low interest or discount on bank loans . We have seen that the disinclination to buy results in a disinclination to borrow . The banks , therefore , when the disinclination to buy goods is pronounced , have relatively small deposits and large reserves . They are in favorable condition for the making of loans but the business world is not in a mood to borrow . As a result , bank discount rates are temporarily low . We may see , here , another consequence of the fact that it is business purchases rather than private purchases which are the most affected , at least in the first instance and directly , by depression . For the borrowing from commercial banks is chiefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as such for private expenditure . And while it is true that much of this borrowing is for the payment of wages , so that a decrease of borrowing // results in decrease of employment and in curtailment of expenditures for personal consumption by wage earners , and although their curtailment of expenditures reacts on the attitude of borrowers , nevertheless it is this attitude of borrowers which is chiefly responsible for the entire situation . If depression lasts long enough so that leases have to be renewed and long-time loans refunded during its con tinuance , then annual rentals and long-time interest rates are also likely to be somewhat lower , late in the depression , than at other times in the cycle . The latter part , then , of a period of business depression , will be likely to be marked by ' a relatively small volume of business , by low prices , low wages , small stocks of goods in the possession of manufacturers and dealers , slow ve locity of circulation of money and deposits , small volume of bank deposits subject to check , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-time interest and low rentals . ? 3 . The Period of Revival ? We have seen that with a sufficient fall in the general level of prices there need be no depression , even though the amount of money spent is reduced . Also , depression would eventually cease and prosperity supervene without expansion of credit , or even with a reduction in the volume of money and deposits in circulation , when prices finally became low enough so that active business could be carried on with the decreased number of money units spent . And the inability to sell goods and to get employment without price and wage reductions would eventually , without doubt , force them upon reluctant manufacturers , dealers and laborers . Never theless , it would appear that , in practice , expansion of credit usually goes along with ? if it does not in some degree precede ? business revival , and it seems probable that it is a part cause of such revival and a condition without which revival would not come so soon . Revival // comes , probably , before prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be necessary to make business active if money and deposits in circulation did not increase . It is difficult to pick out any single characteristic of depression and to say that it is a chief factor in recovery . Low prices make money go farther in purchasing goods , yet while employment is slack such money as may be available is not easily obtained for spending by the employed class . Low wages tend to encourage the employment of workers and low prices of raw material tend to encourage the purchase of goods for manufacture , yet while finished goods are unsalable , manufacturers are likely to produce only hesitatingly . So , also , low prices of merchandise at wholesale tend to encourage the replenishing of stocks of goods and this replenishing is the more likely to take place since stocks of goods on hand in stores and warehouses have run low . During depression , buying was conservative . To some extent , old stocks were disposed of . By using up goods on hand , dealers were sometimes able to buy , currently , less goods than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could not do indefinitely . While they were doing it , demand for labor , at previously prevailing wages , to make these goods , was presumably falling and hence the ability of laborers to buy goods at retail , at previously prevailing prices , was falling . But when dealers begin to buy goods as fast as they sell them ? or to sell them as slowly as they buy ! ? the effect of the smallness of their purchases in reducing the demand for labor ceases to be cumulative . If middlemen buy as rapidly as they sell , they are creating a demand for labor , capital and land , in making the goods they thus purchase , sufficient to keep up a demand for the goods so made . But though a progressive decline in business may seem to be arrested at the line where middlemen 's purchases equal their sales , positive revival of business remains yet to be accounted for . We have already noted , earlier in the discussion , that // revival would come eventually with progressive decline of prices , wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With sufficiently low wholesale prices , dealers might slightly extend their purchases . With sufficiently low wages , etc. , manufacturers could afford to sell at these low prices . With low retail prices , even low wages would suffice for the purchase of needed consumption goods . A proper proportionate fall all along the line would , then , bring revival . But , in practice , low prices are only a part of the story . If dealers are tempted to buy more largely than they have been buying during the depression , the chances are that they will ask for more bank credit in order to do so . This additional bank credit , along with the somewhat greater readiness to spend pre-existing credit , enables active buying to occur without any further fall of prices . Supposing this demand for goods to begin to increase with the wholesalers , manufacturers and producers of raw materials would thus be stimulated to further buying and hiring . This would probably mean demand for more bank credit by these business interests also . Or , if the increased buying and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulate purchases at retail and might cause retailers to borrow more largely of banks . Increased demand for goods and for labor may indeed depend upon a progressive change in business sentiment , each such improvement being contributed to by the increased purchasing of some business group and each increase of purchasing being in turn furthered by an improved sentiment . Nevertheless , the increased buying depends upon and operates only through expenditures of money and credit and this probably involves , ordinarily , not merely the spending of the idle funds of business houses , but also the securing of additional credit in the form of bank deposits subject to check and additional money loaned by the banks . The adherent of the theory that average prices depend on the quantity of money and credit in relation to trade , // who has not so carefully stated the theory to himself as to include in it all the qualifying complications necessary to complete understanding , may expect that the expanding credit in the beginning of business revival would raise prices by a proportionate amount . But in fact , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but instead to work out its effects partly in an increase of trade . For during periods of depression stocks of goods are being sold but slowly , manufacturing plants are but partly utilized , and many men are idle . Ifence the expansion of credit is rather the expression of an increasing demand for goods and labor at the existing price level , making possible renewal of active business twit li ; , ut further price reduction , than a means of raising prices . I n part , at least , until business reaches the active stage , the increase of circulating money and deposits merely provides for the expansion of business . Sellers regard themselves as fortunate to be able to make large sales at the prices to which they have finally reconciled themselves and do not , think of asking much , if any , more . Laborers are too well pleased to secure more steady employment to seek , for some time , much higher wages . Indeed , a general attempt to raise prices , wages , etc. , might check the return of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit to carry so much business . The manufacturer will not much raise his prices when he can hire labor at current wages and easily expand production . If he does raise his prices rivals are likely to make the sales . In other words , at prevailing prices supply of goods easily keeps pace with demand simply by the employment of idle labor , the full-time employment of what was part-time labor , and the more complete utilization of partly utilized plants . It is scarcely sufficient to say , in this connection , that sellers continue to sell for low prices because their supplementary costs do not increase with increasing business and because , therefore , they can secure larger profits than // when business was slack , even without raising their prices. * For sellers do not limit their prices to necessary costs if large demand and relative shortage of supply enable them to realize exceptional returns . The retailer , before ven turing to raise his prices , may indeed resort to the whole saler for more goods , to the labor market for more help or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no scarcity of goods for the purpose of such a dealer so long as the goods desired are easily , cheaply and plentifully secured from wholesalers . And it is when the retail mer chant finds that competition is bidding up his costs because of the relative scarcity of goods , labor and space , that he refuses to expand sales except on the condition of higher prices . So , likewise , the manufacturer , pressed for more goods , may not attempt an increase of his prices , lest rivals get part of his business , so long as space is plentiful and but partly utilizable in his and other plants and so long as raw materials and labor are obtainable in sufficient quan tities without appreciably higher bidding than before . And , of course , much the same thing may be said of the producers of raw materials , since they also hire labor and space . Nevertheless , the fact that increasing expenditure during business revival does not raise prices in equal degree is to be explained rather by saying that supply of goods and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that costs do not rise . Costs are significant only as they operate to limit supply . And when we are talking about the general level of prices the limit to supply is a general limit applying to all goods ' rather than to any special kind of goods . This limit is , therefore , less a rel ative than an absolute limit . And until this limit is ap proached , increasing credit may operate more largely to increase production and trade than to increase prices . Just as , when the disposition to spend decreases and credit // slumps , business men and workingmen for a time accept slack business rather than reduce prices and wages sufficiently to have active business and employment , so , when the disposition to spend increases and credit expands , they choose a return of active business and employment rather than at once to raise prices and wages . Let no one argue from this that a larger amount of money in a country is better than a smaller amount or that a country which adopts a policy calculated to increase its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less likely to suffer depressions in business . For more money merely means , in the long run , a permanently higher level of prices . And the forces that bring alternate prosperity and depression can operate as well on this higher price level as on a lower one . If the increase of money should happen to come during a depression , as a result , say , of the discovery of new gold mines , the expenditure of this new money would create an additional demand , at the ruling prices , for goods and labor and might increase business activity instead of at once raising prices . It might , therefore , hasten recovery from depression . But the new money would form the basis for a greater volume of credit and , when recovery from depression was complete , the additional credit possibilities would make a higher price level than before . Bank credit would , then , in all probability , eventually approach as near the new and higher limit as before it did the old and lower one and any credit slump and depression would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not outside the bounds of reason that such an increase of money might so stimulate bank loans and business revival generally as to bring , eventually , a sharper contraction of credit and a more severe depression than might otherwise occur . It appears , then , that business revival waits upon a real increased tendency to buy and hire , which expresses itself partly through the spending of increased sums borDEPRESSION , // rowed ; and that this increased buying and hiring , or spend ing , does not at first raise prices in proportion because its effect is so largely used up in the increase of business activity . ? 4 . Credit Expansion and Rising Prices ? It should be sufficiently obvious , however , that continued expansion of credit , after business has attained its maximum in the prevailing state of the arts and with the prevailing type of business organization , ' must raise the price level . But why should such continued expansion of credit take place ? The explanation appears to lie in the eagerness of the business man , as such , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The period of " good business " so called may not be " good " for all of the community . To persons having constant or fixed incomes , it is a period of relatively high prices with no additional money inflow . But to the borrowing-hiring-buying business man , it is a period of opportunity . It is a period of opportunity because the business man 's expenses do not increase as largely as his gross returns and because , therefore , his profits are rising . With rising profits he feels that he has a motive for in-creasing his business . But to increase his business he needs larger current funds as well , perhaps , as to use more completely what funds he already has . He seeks , there-fore , larger loans of his bank . While , however , many business men may thus try to expand their respective businesses , general expansion is practically impossible when once the unemployed have full-time employment . The manufacturer who expands his business by employing more artizans simply leaves another would-be employer with fewer artizans and a smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second manufacturer ? along with others ? declines to allow his business to be curtailed , the net result is that all pay more for labor but total business done is no // greater . ( In turn , the increased spending power of wage earners et al . makes possible some rise of retail prices . ) Likewise as to rent paid for the use of premises occupied . So , also , as to raw materials . Smith may get more if Jones is willing to manage with less . If both endeavor to get more they will not succeed in doing so but they will bid up the price paid . Or they may both get raw materials by diverting labor , capital and land from some other work to the production of what they desire . But if so , then some other product to the making of which the labor , capital and land might have been devoted will be diminished and its price raised . So it comes about that a period of prosperity is usually a period of rising prices , rising wages and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuller and steadier employment . ? 5 . Crisis and Depression ? We shall see , eventually , that the immediate cause of depression is the credit crisis . Our next task , therefore , is to explain the genesis and nature of the crisis . The crisis is the beginning of a period of liquidat ion . This is a period when old debts are paid off faster than new ones are made . Liquidation means , in the case of book credit ( charge accounts ) , that the demand for goods , so expressed , is for the time being more than offset by the use of money for the paying off of past accounts . In periods of expanding book credit , goods are being purchased by the making of new charge accounts in excess of those which merely balance the old ones paid off . When book credit is neither expanding nor contracting , the amount of money which is paid out from week to week or month to month in liquidating old book credit just about balances the new book credit so that ( except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the relative use of money and checks ) the effect on prices is the same as if there were no book credit . For , while new book credit operates , like money , as demand for goods , yet the repayment of old book credit causes // money to be used which might otherwise be spent for goods . So far as concerns bank credit , a period of liquidation is one in which the banks are making new loans and renewals more circumspectly and hesitantly than ordinarily . Our present problem is to discover the factors which explain the development of this policy . There are several lines of development which may , possibly , tend to produce a crisis . The most obvious and probably the most fundamental is the diminishing ratio of bank reserves to bank deposits , as a result of which bankers come to feel that further credit expansion is dangerous and that loans should be made carefully . This feeling is accentuated by such other conditions in the business world as may appear , to bankers , likely to precipitate trouble for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame on the uneven variation and adjustment of expenses and prices . The period of prosperity is a period of rising prices , rising wages , rising discount rates on short-term loans , rising interest charges on long loans and rising rentals . At first , the discount and interest rates and rentals do not greatly rise . The so-called supplementary expenses of business concerns , such as interest on funded debt and rentals for real estate hired , are expenses fixed , in many cases , by previous contract , for many years in advance . In the early stages of revival , many contracts previously made are still operative . Interest owed each year on funds secured by the sale of tenyear or twenty-year bonds is what it was when the bonds were first issued . Rent on property leased remains what it was when the lease was arranged for . But if loans have to be refunded at the height of prosperity , higher interest is likely to be charged . And if rental contracts have to be renewed when business confidence is greatest and demand for space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger . Thus it may be that the inactive elements in business , receiving a smaller part of the returns from // business ventures during the early period of prosperity , receive a larger part as prosperity approaches its peak . If this is so , then the business-enterpriser class finds its large profits of early prosperity being cut into , as prosperity nears its end , by the growing incomes of these inactive elements . Conclusive statistical evidence that the active elements in business , as a whole , are making less near the termination of prosperity than ( luring the months or years immediately preceding , is probably not now available . Indeed , this may not , be the fact . Perhaps in some cases prices rise , ; ilniost until the crisis itself , fast enough to keep ahead of rising interest and rentals . But a high interest or a high rent which could be easily met if prices continued to rise , may prove to be a heavy burden if , because of restricted bank credit consequent on diminished proport innate reserves , prices in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any rate , interest and rentals do rise ; they are alit , to be highest late in prosperity ; and it is probable that some business concerns , at least , have their profits narrowed in consequence . This tends , of course , to male the banks less willing to grant them large credits . Yet , if bank reserves are ample and business confidence is high , decreased loans to some concerns may go along with increased loans to others and business activity may continue without abatement . The condition of bank loans and deposits and of bank reserves is , therefore , the most fundamental factor in the problem . The period of prosperity may be marked by some unevenness of demand or some maladjustment of production . A spirit of over-confidence , even of speculation , may cause retail dealers to order from wholesalers more rapidly than they are selling to consumers , and may cause manufacturers to order raw materials in excess of their immediate needs for turning out finished products . If , in any line , there appears to be a deficiency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some dealers may // deliberately order more than they want in the hope that , after the order is trimmed down by the producer , they will still get what they need . This , of course , tends to raise the prices of the goods so ordered . At any rate , it appears to be a fact that , as prosperity develops , raw materials rise in price more than finished products , producers ' goods more than consumers ' goods , and wholesale prices more than retail . So long as supplementary expenses , such as rentals and interest on long-term loans , do not rise , manufacturers and middlemen may derive an increased return from their more active business , despite the more rapidly rising prices of raw materials and wholesale goods than of finished products and retail goods . But when supplementary expenses also rise , the rise of raw materials and wholesale prices becomes a matter of concern . The returns in some lines of business may , in consequence , be seriously reduced . In other lines , the returns may seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuance of maladjusted and , perhaps , speculative demand , they can be only temporary . So far as demand for raw materials and wholesale goods is thus speculative , any considerable sign of approaching crisis will cause this demand rapidly to fall off . And so far as the effect of it , through increasing the expenses of manufacturers and dealers , is to lower their net returns , it tends towards hesitation , on the part of the banks , in making loans to them , and eventually , perhaps , towards hesitation on the part of producers , wholesalers , etc. in selling them goods " on time " ( book credit or charge accounts ) . Here again , however , it should be noted that hesitation on the part of banks in loaning to some customers , whose profit margins are being narrowed , may go along with increasing loans to others whose profit margins remain wide or are growing wider . Even while prosperity is increasing , some concerns do poorly and find credit difficult to obtain ; yet this does not bring a crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ICES , PRICE LEVELS AND TRADE nearing of the limit to which , under reserve requirements , credit can be extended , be the principal influence tending to bring crisis and depression ? If restriction of credit occurs on any large scale , it must sharply diminish effective demand for raw materials and finished products . If , furthermore , repayment of loans is called for from persons or business concerns that have borrowed to produce raw materials or manufactured goods or to buy goods at wholesale or retail , these persons or concerns may be forced to sell out at comparatively low prices . Restriction of credit tends , thus , both to decrease the demand for goods and , in some degree , to increase the supply . Taking the credit structure as a whole or , more narrowly , taking the banks as a whole , there is no such thing as " self-liquidating credit . " Those who have borrowed to buy goods and who , being unable to renew their loans , have to sell , can sell only to persons whose buying power , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The buyer is , usually , a borrower , in large part , of the means to buy . But even if he is not , his buying power depends on bank credit ; for the goods he himself has sold , in order to get the means to buy other goods , are bought with funds borrowed from banks . Even the retailer who sells in small quantities and for cash to wage earners , is dependent for his sales upon the wages which his customers receive ; and these wages , in all probability , are paid with money borrowed from banks . Let us , then , give consideration particularly to the banks and to their condition towards the end of prosperity . Their loans are large . Hence , deposits subject to check are likely to be large relative to bank reserves . The amount of money in circulation bears a larger proportion to the amount of money in bank reserves than during the preceding stages of the cycle . As a result of the comparatively deficient bank reserves the banks are charging higher interest and discount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting an arbitrary limit on their lending . The higher interest , by itself , doubtless has some tendency to restrict borrowing . And as it operates to reduce the salable value of many securities and so to reduce the value of their collateral , it may lessen the borrowing even of some to whom the high interest rates would be no deterrent . The growing restriction of credit exercises not only a direct but also an indirect effect on the demand for goods and services . Men who are ready to order large quantities of goods when they fear that prices are going to rise still further , rapidly lose their enthusiasm for such large purchases when limitation of credit makes prices cease to rise , and are anxious to cut their orders to the lowest point when they become convinced that prices will fall . They , therefore , borrow less from the banks to buy with , even though their credit is good , their collateral ample , and the discount rate which seems high to others a matter of minor importance to them . Or , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and checking accounts more hesitantly , which is to say less rapidly . In the equation of exchange , M ' , and V and V ' decrease . As bank credit decreases , book credits or charge accounts probably also decrease . The business establishment to which credit is refused by its bank , or whose credit is sharply limited , is less able , itself , to extend credit to customers . And as business becomes less active and prices begin to fall , suspicion of the solvency of customers may lead to further limitation on their credit buying . Then the demand of these customers for goods is almost necessarily decreased . Furthermore , the disinclination to buy when prices are falling causes a diminution of sales on credit even to concerns the standing of which is unquestioned . All along the line , then , there is in evidence a tendency towards diminishing demand . There is diminishing demand for manufactured goods , diminishing demand for // raw materials , diminishing demand for labor , diminishing demand of consumers for goods at retail . From the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis , into the stage of depression . But why should a decrease of credit and a decreased spending for goods , necessarily involve business depression ? It must , clearly , involve either a reduction of prices or a decrease of business or both . And we can not reasonably expect that the entire effect of the decreased expenditure of money and credit will be expressed , immediately , in lower prices . Producers and dealers will not see why they should accept greatly reduced prices for their output or for the goods which they have bought to sell . They will lower their prices only with reluctance . Artisans and laborers will not easily be convinced that there is any adequate reason why they should take lower wages . Persons who have land and buildings to rent or to sell will not readily understand why they should accept lower rents or prices than those which they have come to look upon as reasonable . Speculative holders of vacant land will , in many or most cases , continue to ask the prices they have been asking . But with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in proportion , the volume of business must decline . Continued lack of demand for goods and labor , with unsalableness of the goods and diminished employment for laborers , will force a readjusting reduction in prices and wages . The will to maintain prosperity prices and wages is broken by the compulsion of circumstances . And there is doubtless some level of prices , wages , etc. , low enough so that , even with greatly diminished spending , business would be active . But the process of readjustment ? through lowered prices , lowered discount rates , growing confidence , and increased borrowing ? may be one requiring several months or ( sometimes ) years , during which business is relatively inactive and " depression " is said to continue . // Business depression is the occasion of tremendous waste , since it means the inactivity of many men and the nonuse of much capital . It is responsible for broken fortunes . It is marked by widespread unemployment , diminished comforts , and sometimes serious deprivation among wage earners . Bread lines , parades of the unemployed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the alternation of prosperity and depression is most extreme . Workingmen feel themselves injured by forces which they do not understand and which they can not control . And they are too easily induced to impute responsibility to others , e.g. the leaders of government and the leaders of industry , who seem wiser than they but who are no more able to apply a remedy . ? 6 . Can Business Conditions be Stabilized ? ? Must we say , then , that nothing can be done ? Is there neither prevention nor mitigation ? Mitigation , at least , of the severity of crises and depressions is certainly possible . Indeed , it is probable that we have already evolved a banking organization by means of which we can prevent panics . The panic may be defined as a disorderly process of attempted liquidation . Depositors are frightened lest they can not get their money from their banks . Therefore they demand it , and there are runs on the banks . The banks , having inadequate reserves , dare not lend . Therefore business men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligations , are oppressed by the fear that , no matter how good their security , they will not be able to borrow . But the Federal Reserve banks can , in an emergency , issue an unlimited volume of Federal Reserve notes to solvent member banks whose customers are demanding their money ; and they can extend any reasonable amount of credit , through member banks , to the business community . But to prevent the alternation of prosperity and depression , more than this is necessary . We have seen that // bank credit expansion and rising prices lead to a crisis . The crisis comes , usually , when the credit expansion is brought to a halt . There follow deflation of credit , business depression , and falling prices . Something would be gained if it were made the duty of those who control , ultimately , the banking policy of the country ? in the United States , the Federal Reserve Board  --  not merely to keep a reserve adequate for safety of the banking system in case of threatened panic , but also to maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stable price level . Then , after a business depression , credit could be allowed to expand easily only until business again reached activity . Thereafter , it could be prevented from expanding much farther , for the only effects of further expansion would be rise of prices , depleted bank reserves , and an eventual sharp , though belated , check to expansion which would probably lead to depression . If expansion were thus limited early , it could be limited gradually , without jar or shock , and , probably , without bringing decrease of credit , falling prices , and business depression . But an undue and too-persistent credit restriction , or a sharp credit restriction when there is no especial tendency to credit expansion and rising prices , is likely to bring business depression , unemployment for millions of workers and destitution for the families of many of them , falling prices and numerous business failures . The Federal Reserve Board can undoubtedly , by following such a policy , produce the evils of depression almost at any time . What , indeed , caused the crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by several of the Federal Reserve banks in the latter half of 1929 were the highest since 1921 . Has this fact no significance ? Any sharp credit restriction , however desirable it may seem in its inception , should , if and when it seems to threaten these evils , be immediately and radically corrected before depression has a chance to become serious . Rediscount // rates should be reduced greatly and quickly , and the Federal Reserve banks should , under their open market powers , purchase eligible securities to whatever extent may be necessary to restore normal conditions and maintain a substantially stable price level . For , by the purchase of securities , money and bank credit are put into circulation , and a sufficient amount of such money and bank credit must surely increase demand for goods and labor and conduce to rapid recovery . The United States is now so large a part of the industrialized credit-using world that any credit policy of the Federal Reserve Board is bound to have wide influence . Thus , a definite policy of so restricting credit as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if credit were permitted to expand and prices to rise abroad , cause larger purchases of us by foreigners , flow of gold here , depletion of the gold reserves of foreign banks and perhaps , therefore , compulsory curtailment of credit and resulting fall of prices abroad . On the other hand , an initial curtailment of credit abroad and falling prices there might deplete American bank reserves and compel a curtailment of credit here that would involve falling prices and business depression , unless the Federal Reserve banks had available large enough reserves to afford a considerable drain of gold without having to curtail credit . Such reserves it should be the aim of the Federal Reserve banks to keep . Then the flow of gold to foreign countries consequent on low prices abroad might suffice to relieve credit stringency in these foreign countries and to bring about some recovery in prices before sharp curtailment of credit to protect reserves became necessary in the United States . Certainly the Federal Reserve banking system of the United States could , by itself , do something to stabilize business conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Federal Reserve system could not prevent American prices and American business conditions from being somewhat affected by prices // and business conditions in the rest of the world , and if , therefore , nothing like absolute stability could be attained , it would yet be worth while more nearly to approximate such stability than we now do . And this is clearly possible for us , if only the facts become generally understood and if public opinion will steadfastly support , despite the temporary benefits of inflation to certain classes , the requisite restrictive measures . A still greater measure of stability might be assured through some form of agreement , by treaty or otherwise , binding the central banking institutions of the five or six principal industrial and commercial countries to a more or less common policy . The annual production of gold , and , particularly , that part of the annual output which flows into the monetary stock of the world , has never been a very large per cent of the total volume of money . One reason is that gold is a durable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accumulated production , not of months or of a year or two , as in the case of apples , wheat , corn , raw wool , etc. , but of centuries . Another reason is that some of the money of the world is silver and paper money the quantity of which is more or less fixed , as is the case with the silver dollars and the greenbacks in the United States . These silver dollars are not coined freely and they do not increase or decrease as gold increases or decreases . Hence , even if the amount of gold in the monetary stock of the world should increase , in any one year , by as much as five per cent , the total volume of money would not increase in that proportion nor would prices rise in that ratio . If , therefore , governments would refrain from rapidly increasing or decreasing their issues of silver and paper money , and if the principal central banking institutions of the world would do their utmost to stabilize prices through stabilizing the volume of bank credit , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nevertheless , in the long run there might be changes in the price level and , // perhaps , accompanying changes in the condition of business consequent on the larger or smaller output of gold in re-lation to population changes and industrial development . For example , new and rich discoveries of gold could con-ceivably so increase the volume of money that even com-plete withdrawal of Federal Reserve bank credit , as by sale of all securities held by the Federal Reserve banks , and , perhaps , a like withdrawal of funds by the central banks of other countries , would not prevent prices from rising . It may , therefore , eventually be thought wise to substitute for the gold monetary standard some standard of more stable value . But enough can be done through intelligent banking control to make the putting into effect of such control a desirable and an important next step . We should be taking a further step and one likely to be more completely effective in stabilizing prices and business if we substituted for the present gold standard ( or , in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a standard based on commodities-in-general . This does not mean that the dollar ( or other monetary unit ) would be redeemable in a composite of all commodities . It would best be made redeemable , probably , in gold . ' But it would not be at all times redeemable in the same amount of gold . It should be made redeemable , con-tinuously or at short intervals , in that amount of gold which would purchase a definite total of commodities-in-general . To illustrate , suppose a dollar to be , at the start , the equivalent of 25 grains of gold , and suppose that the United States Treasury would sell paper dollars for that much gold , or gold for dollars . Suppose , further , that prices rise by ( say ) 1 per cent . If , then , the legal value of the dollar is changed to 25% grains , the rise of prices will // tend to be , wholly or in part , corrected . The dollar is thereafter worth , when redeemed , 1 per cent more in gold than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in gold until dollars were so scarce as to be worth as much as the 254 grains of gold in which they were being redeemed . If , nevertheless , prices continued high , the dollars could be made redeemable in larger and larger amounts of gold until finally the rise was stopped and prices were restored to their former level . It may be thought that , since over 90 per cent of our business is done by checks and drafts , bank credit expansion might make prices rise despite the decreased quantity of money . But such a system of stabilizing the money unit would make any continued rise of prices from bank credit inflation impossible . The resulting presentation of money to the ' . Treasury Department for gold would tend to decrease bank reserves and to compel the banks to bring the inflat ion:t y movement to an early halt . I f , on the other hand , prices should fall 1 per cent , then the dollar could be made exchangeable for only 24% grains of gold . This reduction in the Treasury Department 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for dollars , would increase the number of dollars in circulation and in buck reserves , would encourage expansion of bank credit and would tend to restore prices . If , during any brief ' period of falling prices before correction was effected , there should be a , degree of business depression , the increase of dollars would operate to bring rapid relief by increasing the demand for goods . Another possible arrangement would be for the government to establish a paper money with no specific agreement for redemption , but to issue additional paper dollars , if prices began to fall , by purchasing outstanding government bonds and also , possibly , gold and silver ; and , in case of any tendency of prices upward , to sell government // bonds as well as , perhaps , gold and silver and to withdraw from circulation the money so paid in to the treasury . ? 7 . A Fallacious Theory of Business Depressions It will perhaps help to clinch an understanding of the business cycle and of the causation of business depression , if we examine , briefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the theory that business depression is a result of excessive saving . This theory has found favor among some economists of reputation who ought to know better and for whom there is the less excuse in view of the teachings of the best among the earlier economists . But the most dogmatic and insistent supporters of the theory have probably been the socialists , whose desire it is to show that periods of business depression , unemployment and acute misery , are the inevitable outgrowth of the system of private property and individualistic business . " Oversaving , " it is said , means lack of demand ; lack of demand means that there is a relative excess of supply , or an allaround " over-production " ; over-production means succeeding shut-downs and unemployment . The hidden and unsound premise on which the oversaving theory is based is that those who save do not enter the market on the demand side , that they do not create a demand for goods and , therefore , for labor ; while those who spend for current consumption do create such a demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is done , the less easily can goods be marketed and the greater will be the amount of unemployment . Emphasis is placed on the alleged under-payment of wage workers with a consequent inability of wage workers to buy the output of industry , and upon alleged large returns to an employing class which can not spend all of these returns and which , therefore , is compelled to save . Since the employers save , it is supposed that they do not buy , that they do not give expression , through expending money , to any demand for labor . After // a period of prosperity and steady employment , during which , according to orthodox socialist doctrine , wage workers have received less than " the full product of their labor , " unsalable goods are on hand in such quantities that a shut-down and a period of unemployment are inevitable . Clearly , the entire argument hinges on the assumption that the saving of the capitalist-employers prevents their buying . To test this assumption and the conclusions drawn from it , let us inquire what are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incomes . There are four possible dispositions which they can make of these incomes . They can spend them for immediately consumable goods or services ; they can invest them in durable or production goods ; they can hoard them as unused money or deposits ; they can throw them into the depths of the sea . Let us see whether , in any of these cases , there is over-saving or all-around overproduction of a sort to produce business depression . Suppose , first , that the capitalists spend their presumed large money incomes for immediately consumable goods . In that case the inability of the low-paid workmen to purchase the goods produced , is offset by the large purchasing ability of the prospering capitalists . True , these capitalists may not want the woolen cloth , shoes , etc. , which the workingmen would buy in larger volume did not their assumed low wages prevent . But there will not on that account be an over-production of these goods beyond the market for them . For the labor and associated factors of production which would produce these goods if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goods which the capitalists want . If the prosperous capitalists want pleasure yachts , automobiles , beautiful country homes , palatial city residences and other luxuries , and if labor , land and capital are devoted exclusively to producing the sorts of goods ordinarily purchased by the poor , there will of course be relative over-production of the // latter kinds of goods , i.e. there will be production of them beyond the point where they are as profitable to produce as are the goods which the capitalists want . But the insistent demand of prosperous capitalists for the goods of their desire will prevent even such relative over-production from continuing for long . The temptation to produce what the capitalists want is too great . Let us now consider the second possible disposition of the capitalists ' money , viz. , the spending of it solely for . investment goods . This is the disposition of it implied by the socialists when they say that the capitalists save much and spend comparatively little . What the capitalists then do is to spend for office buildings , factories , bridges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of for clothing , steam and sailing yachts , cut flowers , etc . They can not invest without purchasing and , therefore , they can not invest without spending . If they buy the stock or bonds of corporations , the money they so spend is re-spent by such corporations for buying or building factories , locomotives , power machinery or other capital . To be sure , one capitalist may buy stocks or bonds , not from the issuing corporation which thus gets the money to spend for labor and goods but from a previous buyer . But in that case the previous buyer again has money to invest and may invest it so as to cause the construction of capital . Even to put money into a savings bank does not keep it from being so invested but is an indirect method of so investing it . The savings bank becomes , in effect , the agent of the combined depositors and buys bonds and mortgages with their money . If we trace the consequences of the spending of money for investment , we shall see that such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods and for labor . Suppose a person who has saved , to invest in the stock of a railroad company either directly or through the intermediation of a savings bank . The railroad company is seeking the money in order ( say ) to tunnel through a // mountain . The money is expended , labor is hired and the mountain is tunneled . There is , in this case , no demand for cut flowers , food , clothing or other quickly consumable goods on the part of the investing capitalists . But there is a demand for durable goods , for tunnel , so to speak . And so there need be no over-production . If labor , land and capital are devoted to producing the demanded tunnel instead of the not-demanded other goods , there will not be even relative over-production . In any event there will not be all , - around oeer-production . In short , the notion that saving conduces to an excess of production because the savers do not , buy goods to consume , together with its implied premise t hat the persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cottic into the market as demanders of goods or labor , deserves to be classed with the notion that there can be devised perpetual motion machines or the notion that fortunes c:m be told by the stars . Of course , if s:i-Mg goes on indefinitely , the increase of the instruncents of production , i.e. , of capital in its various forms , will reduce the earning power of capital . With more capital , the rule of interest on capital will tend to be lower . Perhaps the much-feared savers might decide , by the time the rate of return on capital got down to ( say ) 2 per cent , that further accumulation would not pay and might begin to spend their incomes for consumable goods . If so , there would surely need be no more fear of " oversaving . " But if not , if , on the contrary , even with the rate of interest on capital going down to % of one per cent , of one per cent , and lower , the savers persisted in saving and investing , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest went actually to zero and capitalists could no longer increase their capital for lack of earnings to buy with , this would merely mean that other elements in the community , such as wage earners or land owners , were now receiving larger incomes than // before and could buy more goods in proportion as the zero-interest capitalists could buy less . But let us consider the third and fourth possible dispositions of the capitalist-employers ' money incomes , viz. , hoarding them and throwing them into the sea . If their money incomes are hoarded , there is , temporarily , less money in circulation . If their money is thrown away , there is permanently less money in circulation . In either case there is less demand for goods at the previous price level . But in neither case is there all-around over-production . Prices will inevitably become low enough so that what capitalists who have hoarded or thrown away their money , will not or can not buy , other classes will buy . For capitalists to throw their money incomes away amounts to their taking no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resultant lower prices , to the rest of the community . If capitalists merely hoard their money , the rest of the community will find prices temporarily reduced in equal degree but prices will in this case tend to rise again if and when the hoarded money gets back into circulation . It is no answer to the argument presented above , to say that decreased money in circulation , together with a general disinclination to accept reduced prices , wages , etc. , may lead to depression . For to say this is to admit that the problem is a monetary and credit problem and is to give away the whole case for " all-around over-production . " As a matter of fact , the supposition that capitalists may hoard their money was included among the various hypothetical dispositions of it only in order that the case might be complete and that every possible objection might be anticipated . It is well known that , in the more highly industrialized countries , capitalists do not , in any large degree , hoard their money , but invest in further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // ? 8 . Summary ? The argument of this chapter has been long and may have seemed to have devious windings . Yet the principal conclusions reached can be briefly stated . The business cycle includes depression , revival , prosperity and crisis . The period of depression can be characterized as a period of hesitant buying . Dealers and manufacturers wish to work off stocks of goods on hand and order conservatively . Plants are incompletely utilized . Labor is incompletely employed . Bank reserves are large and interest charges are low ; but business men borrow only hesitantly because they are buying but hesitantly . The conditions induced by depression favor revival . Low prices encourage buying . Low interest or discount rates encourage borrowing to bmy . But when revival has gone far enough so that industry is generally active , further borrowing and spending operate solely to raise prices . This rise of prices is likely to be uneven . Certain expenses of business may increase , for a while , so slowly as to make borrowing for business purposes exceptionally profitable , thus causing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is the period of eager buying . Eventually , the expansion of credit , must come to a halt . Bank reserves tend to become inadecruate . Interest rates tend to rise . Borrowing is discounc , ged . Prices cease to rise . Credit is refused to enterprises which seem , when prices have stopped rising , not to be safe risks . Speculative buying in anticipation of further price increases stops . The giving of credit by one business concern to another is more guarded . Demand for goods declines . Business becomes less active . Prices fall . Anticipation of further decreases in prices operates to further decrease demand . Money accumulates in bank reserves and discount rates fall . Modern industry is a vast co-operative undertaking . To a large extent the co-operation is scarcely conscious , the result of voluntary individual action , each individual // contributing to the supply of goods or services desired by others , as the best means of securing the money with which to meet his own needs or wants . Yet , to get the best results , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , a deliberate and consciously planned cooperation . In the public service industries , competition is wasteful . Unregulated private monopoly is grasping . Deliberate regulation by the community , state or nation , is essential . In the case of money , a variety of unrelated coins or issues would be confusing and would seriously interfere with industry and commerce . Uniformity is desirable and national control of coinage secures such uniformity , at least within the nation . In the case of banking , the unregulated competition of numerous private corporations lays the train for panics . Control by a central bank , or , in the United States , by a few large banks subject to a common regulation , seems to have proved effective in making panics a thing of the past . But the alternation of prosperity and depression remains . And the evils of depression , measured in terms of human suffering , are great . We need to extend centralized control farther . We need to use it to prevent credit expansion when such expansion tends merely to raise prices , to encourage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to bring later depression . The United States alone could do much to mitigate the severity of business depressions . The United States in co-operation with a few of the other large industrial and commercial countries could do more . It may be desirable , eventually , to supersede the gold standard as we now know it with a more stable standard of value ; but a more intelligent control of credit , by itself , would accomplish very much indeed for business and price stability . A dollar redeemable in varying amounts of gold according as gold fluctuated in value relative to other commodities would , however , make possible a more complete stabilization of prices in the long // run , even in the absence of foreign co-operation . It would tend , somewhat , to prevent undue bank credit expansion and it would tend to keep business conditions constant . But if the best results are to be secured , proper control of bank credit , i.e. , the well-timed putting out and drawing in of the funds of the Federal Il , eserve banks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the paper dollar might be made . redeemable . For , if business tends to be dull and prices tend downward , the Federal Reserve banks , by charging low discount rates to member banks and by purchasing drafts . ind other eligible securities ( e.g. United States government , bon(Is) in the open market , can put more money and bank credit into circulation , so stimulating business and restoring the general price level . And if , on the other hand , prices rise , then higher discount rates charged to member banks and the selling , by the Federal Reserve banks , of a stiflicient volume of the securities held in their vaults , will draw money and bank credit out of circulation and bring ( or hold ) the price level down . The way to build an ideal economic society is , indeed , neither to follow the lead of the radle.illy-minded socialist who would revolutionize our entire economic system , nor yet to be guided by the inclinations of the unthinking conservative who desires only that the ftiture shall differ little from the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may , without destroying the system as a whole , nevertheless remove the causes of each specific evil in it . CHAPTER , VI TRADE , PROTECTIVE TARIFFS AND PRICES ' ? 1 . Common Opinion and the Influences Determining Legislation ? Among the notions of economic policy which are certainly fervently held by millions , and probably by a safe majority , of our fellow citizens , is the notion that a protective tariff is an effective means of promoting the common welfare . It is currently believed that the tariff raises wages , insures employment and keeps domestic business active . To many advocates of protection the belief in its efficacy is , indeed , almost a faith . Frequently it is bound up with an inherited allegiance to party . In other cases the belief that protection guarantees prosperity is accepted as true because of its constant reiteration by business associates . Yet most of those who place their belief thus unfalteringly in the protective tariff and who look with unconcealed dread upon every proposal seriously to lower it , would resent any insinuation that they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , be able to give a reason which will bear the test of scientific analysis . But a reason which satisfies themselves and 119 // which , they think , should satisfy others , they usually can give . For representative government , in matters of large conscious moment to the public , involves , ordinarily , not legislation by representatives according either to their own wisdom or the judgment of expert advisers , but according to the desires or supposed desires of their constituents . The votes in the legislative body on a question like the tariff are in the direction of the influential sentiment and the prevailing pressure from " back home . " A passionless and scientific consideration of causes and consequences , uninfluenced by the ebb and flow of general community sentiment , can hardly be said to exist in a modern legislative assembly except in respect to matters too trivial for general attention . The representative may not ordinarily be doing violence to his own conscience when he votes as his constituents desire . In most cases he shares their ideals and prejudices and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding which sentiment is overwhelming , he is bound to sympathize with the views of his constituents , at least publicly , or he will soon cease to be their representative . And so the legislative assembly , in such great historic controversies as those over slavery , the tariff , the currency and the trusts , although its members have undoubtedly had some influence on public opinion , has probably been , in the main , not so much the determiner of public desires and policies as their instrument . On all such matters , then , discussion is general and sometimes rages furiously . And all of the controversies above mentioned , as it happens , were or are , at least in part , economic controversies . No wonder , therefore , that , in a sense , every man is his own political economist . And no wonder that passion and partisan bias are aroused and that the average man feels a sentimental confidence in the truth of his own opinions that he might not feel in less controversial matters . Indeed , the farmer , business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of political economy is often surer of his opinion on the tariff question , more violently excited by dissent and more disposed to controversy than the trained student . ? 2 . The Advantages of International Trade ? Perhaps the most effective approach to the protective tariff problem is through a consideration of the nature and advantages of international trade . Whatever may be said regarding the desirability of interfering with such trade for certain purposes and within certain limits , its advantages , in the large , can not be gainsaid . A country gains by international trade in two ways . It gets goods which , practically , can not be produced at home . And it gets by trade , with relative cheapness , goods which could be produced within its borders only at greater expense . These two ways of gaining from international trade grade into each other . Thus , the rubber plant , the banana and other tropical products could doubtless be produced in the United States under artificial conditions , ? as in hot-houses . But the ? cost of tropical products so secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparatively wealthy . And few , even among ardent protectionists , would advocate tariff restriction upon their importation to foster their production at home . On the other hand , protectionists are continually urging the desirability of excluding or partly excluding , through tariffs , goods which must then be produced at home for a somewhat greater and , sometimes , for a considerably greater cost than the price at which they could be imported . The advantages of international trade are , in truth , the advantages of specialization of persons , capital and geographical resources , which we accept in domestic trade without much question . In the case of international trade we but extend this specialization over a wider area . As one man mends clothes ? while another raises wheat , as one group of men and women produce cloth in a textile mill // while another group produce books in a printing establishment , as the people of Iowa and Nebraska produce corn while those of the Carolinas produce cotton ; so the people of the United States may produce wheat , corn , cotton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while other peoples , from whom we buy , produce coffee , cocoa , tea , rubber , bananas , paper , toys , olives , figs and various other goods . Wherein the gain lies when the goods purchased abroad are goods which might instead have been produced at home may be made clear by consideration of a simple hypothetical case . We may suppose , then , that , in American mills , the output of woolen cloth of a given grade is 10 yards per person employed per day , while the output of shoes of a given kind is an average per person employed of two pairs per day . We may also suppose that the two pairs of shoes , sold abroad , would purchase 16 yards of woolen cloth from a country or countries where the cloth could be produced with greater relative cheapness . Then we in America would secure more cloth by making shoes , exporting them , and buying cloth with the proceeds than we could secure by making the cloth ourselves . The same amount of work would yield a larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through being able to purchase shoes in exchange for their woolen cloth . They would thus secure more shoes for the same effort than if they made their own . For there it might well be that 20 yards of cloth could be produced as easily as two pairs of shoes . Specialization , then , appears to be to the advantage of both parties to a trade or of both trading countries . By selling shoes abroad and buying cloth we get more cloth ; and by selling cloth to us and buying shoes the people of the other country or countries get more shoes . It subtracts nothing from this conclusion that the buying and selling is done through the intermediation of cornTRADE , // mercial and bank drafts or bills of exchange and in terms of money units . For , in the last analysis , the exchange is really an exchange of goods of one kind for goods of another kind . And by making this exchange we can have more goods than if we did not make it . But why , we seem to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , receive their pay in gold and bring the gold home to be coined into American money , rather than to spend it in buying foreign goods . Perhaps the answer is that we might do so but that the unprofitableness of such action would , in the absence of tariffs or other restrictions , surely dissuade us from it . Such action would increase our own money greatly while it would tend to decrease the amount of money abroad . The spending of this money at home would increase the demand for American goods at prevailing prices . Its deposit in banks and the use of the checking accounts so secured would have the same effect . Its deposit in banks and its consequent availability as bank reserves making possible and stimulating to a greater expansion of bank credit would tend even further to increase the demand for goods . This increased demand would operate in the direction of a higher level of prices . If prices did not rise relatively to prices in the other country or countries then a further excess of sales over purchases must bring still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money and , therefore , credit also , available in the United States for spending , would be so large that prices must become higher relatively to prices abroad , than before . But such a relative rise in American prices could not go on indefinitely . It must decrease the sales of American goods abroad , ? in our illustration , American shoes . For , with the rise of prices in the United States , the amounts which could be made in other lines and the amounts which must be paid in wages , etc. , would rise and , therefore , the price which shoe manufacturers would feel compelled // to charge for shoes must also rise . And this , together with the fall of prices abroad , would make the purchase of shoes from us by foreigners unduly expensive . Our exports would decrease . Also , the relative fall of prices abroad would tempt to increase of American buying abroad . It should , indeed , be obvious to any reasonable person that other countries can not buy American goods if these goods may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce . And no country which has not rich gold mines can continue indefinitely to buy goods with gold . It is true that we may send goods , without buying in return , to countries to which we are in debt , and we can sell goods upon credit . It is also true that we may be able to sell goods to European countries and buy goods in Africa and South America , letting Europe send goods to those continents in indirect exchange for the goods they get from us . But that we can in any other sense long sell without buying is preposterous . And it would not help us if we could . For that would mean more money in America and higher prices here , but fewer goods . Let those whose prejudices are too strong for their common sense insist , if they will , that prosperity is made by getting rid of goods and accumulating stocks of money . It remains true , nevertheless , that not thus are the shelterless to be housed , the naked clothed or the hungry fed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons who appear to view most sceptically the apparent advantages of international trade , at least so far as importation is concerned , are those who advocate a protective tariff to restrict it . What are the actual effects of a protective tariff and why does it have these effects ? Can we forget for a while our hereditary political affiliations and the influence which protection may have on the prosperity of the specific lines of business in which we happen to be engaged , and examine the tariff , without prejudice , to determine its effects on the welfare of the country as a whole ? // If we can not do this , we might as well drop the investigation here as to proceed further . Political or other bias has properly no more place in such an investigation than it has in an investigation into the effect of friction in the axles in retarding the speed of a vehicle or into the effect of ball bearings in lessening such friction . Let us consider , then , how a protective tariff on any article would affect the interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted that a protective tariff , as such , is not intended to secure revenue for government . The government gets revenue only by collecting a tax on imported goods . If the tariff is so high that no goods are imported , then the government gets no revenue . And the avowed purpose of a protective tariff is to discourage imports . But there is no point to levying a tariff to exclude foreign goods if and when the domestic article is sold so cheaply that the foreign goods could not , in any event , compete with the domestic in price . Yet duties are not infrequently levied in such cases . At the present time the United States has duties on wheat , corn and various other farm products which foreigners could not possibly sell here in any considerable amount if at all . In the case of wheat , for example , American farmers produce more than the home market will absorb . They have to sell the surplus abroad , through the grain dealers , at the current world-market price . They can not get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than for what is sold abroad . A higher price at home would make every seller prefer to sell at home . This would flood the home market until it was no longer profitable to sell here . In other words , the surplus output of wheat would force down the domestic price to such a point that part of the wheat , at least , would be more advantageously sold abroad . And the American price could then be , irrespective of whether or not there was a protective tariff , no higher than the foreign price // minus the cost of shipment to the foreign market . Only a monopoly , controlling the domestic supply of an article , will ever keep the domestic price higher than the foreign price when there is a surplus to sell abroad . A person having thousands of competitors will not keep his part of the product out of the home market , if he can get even a little higher price there , and sell it abroad for less , in order to keep up the domestic price for the benefit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price , when there is a surplus , lower than the . foreign price by the cost of shipment to the foreign market . It need not be denied that , a small amount of wheat might occasionally , in the absence of protection , be sent into the northern part of the United States from Canada . And , of course , a high protect ive tariff prevents this . But to prevent such importation can only force more Canadian wheat abroad where it tends to hold down the price which the American farmer can get for his wheat , as much as if it were sold in the United States . Such a tariff can not possibly benefit American farmers in the great wheat rais ing areas of the United States which produce a surplus of wheat . ' Attention was called , in a previous chapter , ' to the fact that success in politics flows rather from other character istics than from the ability to follow the intricacies of economic reasoning or from an impersonal , scientific atti tude towards economic problems . Nevertheless , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American congressmen do not understand how impossible it is for a protective tariff to benefit the producer of wheat so long as the United States has a surplus of wheat for export . Is it to be supposed that the average representative or senator does not understand so easily explainable a fact ? If , indeed , he does not , we must exonerate him from any charge of intentional deceit . Otherwise we can only conclude that congressmen deliberately support a tariff bill which they know can not possibly do what it is ostensibly intended to do , in the hope that farmers will believe such a bill calculated to increase the price of wheat and will be fooled into satisfaction with the labors of their representatives . Since such a tariff has no effect in maintaining the price of wheat , its enactment may fitly be compared to a law providing for duplicate foundations to hold up a bridge , these foundations being , however , at their highest point , fifty feet lower than the bridge to be supported . But legislative faith in the tariff as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheat , seems recently to have waned . In view of the contemporary advance of government funds , raised by taxes , to the Federal Farm Board , and the current use ( 1930 ) of these funds by the Board , some further comment may seem to be called for . Of course , a surplus which keeps domestic prices so low that a tariff is of no effect , can be turned into a practical scarcity if the government spends large enough funds to buy many millions of bushels and deliberately holds them out of the market . Will the tax-paying and the bread-eating public consent to such a policy year after year and to the permanent destruction of the wheat so purchased and held ? Or will they consent that this wheat be sent , in successive years , as a gift to foreigners or sold to them at a loss to the government , in order to keep the domestic price of wheat ? and so of bread ? above the level of the world market ? For if the wheat so purchased with government funds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sold wherever it will bring the most , as it would be if privately owned , then the domestic price , granted an exportable surplus , can not possibly remain above the world-market level . Let us now consider , however , a case such that a protective tariff really keeps up the price of the protected article . In order that protection may have this effect , the thing protected must be something which can be produced more cheaply abroad th:tiu in the protecting country and which , therefore , in the absence of tariff protection , would be imported . Let us take woolen cloth to be such an article , assuming that its cost , if imported , is 20 cents a yard and that the cost of producing it at home is 40 cents a yard . Then a tariff of 20 cents or something more , per yard , would enable the home producers of woolen cloth to sell for 40 cents a yard , whereas , without such a tariff , they would have to meet the price of their foreign competitors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if 40 cents a yard is the cost of producing in the United States , is it possible for a domestic manufacturer to produce cloth and sell for less than cost ? Does he not " need " a tariff which will enable kiln to charge for the cloth at least what it costs to make it ? In order to answer this question intelligently we need to consider what is meant by cost of production . When demand and supply are equal , the cost of production ( of the marginal unit produced ) is , under conditions of competition , just equal to the price . Cost of production is resolvable into what the factors engaged in producing a given article could secure if each such factor were diverted to another industry . To say , therefore , that the cost of production of cloth is 40 cents a yard is to say that the amount which could be secured elsewhere by the labor , the capital and the land which is required to produce , jointly , a yard of cloth , is 40 cents . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the business of manuTRADE , // facturing woolen cloth in the United States can be secured for a less amount per yard produced than 40 cents , then it is nonsense to say that the cost is 40 cents per yard . If the best that the labor and other factors required can get in another no less agreeable industry is 19 cents , then a price of little more than 19 cents a yard will be enough to draw labor and other factors into cloth manufacturing , and the home product will be able , without any tariff , to undersell the foreign product in the home market . And if enough such cloth can be produced , at 19 cents , to satisfy the entire domestic demand , a tariff will not , in the absence of monopoly control , raise the domestic price . It may happen , of course , that some labor , land and capital can be secured at 19 cents while other labor , land and capital , being relatively better adapted to other industries , can not be drawn into woolen cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 cents . Or perhaps some labor , while not able to secure larger returns elsewhere , may find work in textile mills so relatively disagreeable that only a high wage and a correspondingly high price of cloth will draw it in . If the desired woolen cloth can not be secured , at home , without drawing into the business labor , land and capital which will not come at less than 40 cents and if the demand , at that price , is sufficient to take all that can be produced by drawing in such labor , land and capital , then the result of a high protective tariff must be to make the price of the cloth 40 cents a yard . The cloth would cost 40 cents a yard at the margin , i.e. to the marginal producing factors ? the ones that would not stay for less . It may be worth while to point out , here , that what it might be necessary to pay the marginal labor and other factors to bring such factors into the business , all labor , land and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get . If one carpenter , A , has to be paid $2000 a year because he can make as much in // another job , the services of another carpenter , B , who is equally efficient , will command as much . If they did not , employers would prefer to hire B , and would bid against each other for B 's services . Competition must inevitably tend ? although , of course , it is often imperfect ? in the direction of giving to those who can easily be induced to enter work in any given line , as much as those get who are barely induced to enter it . If , then , the marginal cost of producing woolen cloth in the United States is 40 cents a yard , the typical cloth manufacturer , reckoning up his actual or prospective expenses for wages , interest and rent ( including returns for his own time , capital and land ) will say that the cloth costs him 40 cents a yard to produce . Doubtless a price somewhat less than 40 cents a yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry , leave some labor , capital and land still in the business . Nevertheless , such a manufacturer would probably say that he " needed " a tariff of at least 20 cents a yard to enable him to compete . Consider the matter now from the viewpoint of the national income . The protective tariff , by preventing the sale of the foreign cloth here , except at 40 cents or more per yard , enables the domestic producer to charge 40 cents . It enables him to charge what the cloth " costs " him . But to say this is merely to say that it enables him to charge enough so that he and those he hires and the land and capital used can get as much as , where they are marginal , they could in any case get in other lines . The consuming public must , however , pay 40 cents for its cloth instead of 20 . In other words , the consuming public must pay 20 cents more for every yard of cloth it buys , not in order that home cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise be but merely in order that they may be as well off ( where they are marginal ) as they could be without the tariff if they would go into or remain in the industries for which they are respectively best adapted . // To express still differently the same thought , the general public inevitably loses more than the protected producers gain . For the general public loses 20 cents on every yard of cloth . But the cloth producers do not gain by this entire amount ? if , indeed , they gain at all . So far as it is true that producers must have 40 cents to keep them in the business , this is because there are other lines in which they can engage where they will be as well off , as if producing cloth at 40 cents a yard . If so , they gain nothing by protection . And even if other lines would not be as profitable for them as producing cloth at 40 cents a yard , nevertheless their gain from the tariff is less than the general public 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would rather produce cloth , even at 20 cents a yard , than devote their labor , land and capital to anything else , can it be said that the surplus 20 cents is all net gain to them in excess of what they could get in the next best line or lines open to them . Only in that case does the tariff benefit the protected interests as much as it hurts the public . But even in that case , the gain of the protected interests can not possibly exceed the loss of the purchasing public . For without a tariff they could still engage in the industry ? if they chose ? for a return of 20 cents per yard , or whatever price might be necessary to insure a market for their goods . And to whatever extent the tariff might enable them to increase their price , to just that extent , at least , it would be a burden upon consumers . Up to this point , in our discussion of the protective tariff policy , we have considered the cost of production of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business the marginal labor , land and capital necessary to supply the public . Let us , however , center our attention , for a while , on labor alone , assuming the other costs to be non-existent . So far as labor is concerned , the cost of production of the cloth is the amount per yard neces132 PRICES , PRICE LEVELS AND TRADE sary to bring labor into this line from other lines of production or to keep it from going into other lines . If the labor necessary to produce woolen cloth of the given grade can earn , in the United States , $4 a day at other work and if it can produce but 10 yards of cloth per day , per person employed , then the cloth must sell for not less than 40 cents a yard in order that the 10 yards produced may bring an equal wage in the cloth industry . It is said , however , that protection is necessary in order that the domestic woolen cloth industry may exist , in order that those engaged in it may have employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woolen cloth industry might not exist without protection , but , if so , this is only because the persons engaged in it could do better in something else than they could then do in this industry . Protection keeps them in the industry only at the expense of others . The statement that protection keeps the industry in existence mny be true , but it does not indicate any advantage of protection . And the other two alleged advantages of protection are simply non-existent . The persons engaged in the industry can have all the employment they want , without any tariff , if they will take for their services what these services would then be worth , i.e. they can have the entire domestic market for their domestic cloth , and as much employment in producing cloth as with the tariff , and can have it without tariff protection , if they will only sell the cloth for a low price and take as wages what such a price will yield . They will , perhaps , prefer to follow other lines rather than do so . But to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employment in such other lines . Indeed , to let cloth consumers buy their cloth abroad at 20 cents a yard , would save them the other 20 cents which they could then spend on other things . Also , it would enable foreigners to buy more American goods . Thus , in two ways would such purchase abroad contribute to the demand for American labor . // We come , then , to the contention so familiar to our American public , that protection makes wages high . In the sort of case we are considering it may possibly raise the wages of some persons . But it can do so , if at all , only at the expense ? normally the much greater expense ? of other persons . Those cloth-producing wage earners who could do no better in any other line than they could do in woolen cloth production under conditions of free trade , who could not earn in any other line more than $2 per day , would gain , by virtue of the tariff , 20 cents additional a yard or $2 additional a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of those other workers , e.g. carpenters , bricklayers , iron-moulders , mechanics and farm ers , who have to buy the cloth at the increased price. * We may safely assert , then , that no protective tariff on goods which can be imported more cheaply than they can be produced at home , and as to which this condition remains indefinitely true , can possibly raise the wages of those pro ducing such goods without taking an equal amount away from the consumers , who are , in the large , equally likely to be wage earners . We have already found reason to believe , however , that average wages are actually lowered by a tariff . Most of the protected wage earners , if protec tion were removed , would not need to stay in the woolen cloth industry and get only 20 cents a yard or $2 a day . They would be able to engage in other industries yielding more than this ; some of them , perhaps , could earn $4 a day and under free trade the $4 would buy more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give much less ? if anything ? to the workers in the protected in industry than it takes away from other workers . This is the normal and to-be-expected result of tariff protection . It is a means by which some gain relatively little ? if at // all ? and by which others lose much . It is a means by which part of the people of the protectionist country get more than their services would otherwise command in the protected work and get it at the expense of their fellow citizens who have to buy goods at prices enhanced by protection . Any group of persons who take steps through lobbying , propaganda and otherwise thus to get themselves protected at the general expense and who are therefore able to get larger incomes than the industry they are in would yield if not protected , certainly can not be said to earn such incomes in the sense that they give a quid pro quo . On the contrary they are instrumental , through their political influence , in preventing the general public from securing desired goods as cheaply as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out consumers from an alternative market . Their influence is in the direction of forcing the public to pay them a higher price for goods which might otherwise be got for a lower price . They profit , by doing the public an injury . And the unfortunate fact is that our protective tariff is maintained , partly , to be sure , because of ignorance and partisan bias , but largely through the influence of such purely selfish and exploitive interests . The selfishness in question is not necessarily altogether conscious . There are some , of course , who can frankly work for their own private gain in ways that admittedly arc injurious to others , and who will use every influence to maintain economic regulations and institutions which are advantageous to themselves although they know very well that these regulations and institutions work adversely to the general welfare . But probably the majority of persons who defend their own individual and class interests at every crisis of public policy are more sensitive to criticism , more anxious to appear public spirited in the eyes of others and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face their fellow citizens with greater assurance and live with themselves more comfortably if they persuade themselves by one or another sophistry that what is good for their own pockets is also good from the point of view of the public welfare . And so , in perhaps most cases , they make themselves really believe , or , at least , half believe , that they are of the better class of citizens , and that they are supporting whatever law or regulation or system of property they desire , because of their concern for the welfare of the community ! We have now traced out the effects of protection , socalled , on national wealth and on wages . We have seen that to shut out cloth which could be sold in the United States at 20 cents a yard in order to have the production carried on within the United States at 40 cents , compels the consumers of cloth to pay 20 cents more on every yard without adding an equivalent amount , and , in many cases , without adding anything at all to the incomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods is , therefore , advantageous to the people , as a whole , of the importing country . But perhaps this conclusion will be made clearer to some readers if we analyze the protectionist argument with a view to discovering what it really implies . The thorough-going protectionist objects to a flood of lowpriced foreign goods as such . So far from regarding the importation of such goods as a means of gain to a country , he regards it as a menace . He has much to say about low wages in foreign countries and about the " danger " of foreigners " underselling " American producers . The lower foreign wages are and the lower the prices at which foreign goods can be imported ( yet goods produced by efficient and , therefore , highly-paid labor are commonly as low in price and may be lower ) , the more injurious , in this view , is the importation and the more important it is to shut out the goods by a high tariff . Such a protectionist does not feel that he has so convincing a case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not levied upon , would but slightly undersell an American product ; he feels that he has an unanswerable case when he can show that the foreign article is very much cheaper than the same thing can be made in America . If it is true , as such thorough-going protectionists seem to believe , that our prosperity and the level of our wages are more reduced by the importation of foreign goods greatly below American production costs than by the importation of foreign goods only slightly below ; then , obviously , the cheaper are the foreign goods the greater must be the injury . If we are more hurt by importing foreign cloth at 20 cents a yard than we would be by importing the same cloth at 35 cents , then the injury would be still greater could the cloth be purchased abroad for 10 cents ; and the maximum injury would be approached and realized were the price to become 5 cents , 1 cent and zero cents per yard . The consistent adherent of the argument ? but , of course , persons whose ignorance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reason consistently  --  - would have to insist that , for the people of foreign countries to give us cloth ( or other goods ) for nothing , must operate to make American wage earners and the American public in general poorer than if the gifts were not made . It may seem inconceivable to some readers that the above can be a fair characterization of standard protectionist argument . Yet it is a fact that the so-called wages argument for protection has been frequently , probably the most frequently of all arguments , advanced by protectionists in American political contests . And it is actually believed in by , perhaps , a majority of the people including , if public professions can be credited , many prominent political leaders . This , however , is no more a reason for our accepting the argument as sound than the fact that the majority , including the " great leaders " in the political and theological world , then believed the earth to be the staTRADE , // tionary center of things was a sufficient reason , in Galileo 's day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in matters of economic controversy are so deep-rooted that fallacies must always seem to him reasonable and logical , and unbiased logical thinking , fallacious , would do better to leave the study of economics alone and confine his atten tion to some field into which his prejudices do not enter . The truth is , of course , that if foreign countries were to offer us any special article , e.g. cloth , for nothing , the labor which now has to be devoted to making cloth at home ? or to making some other article to trade for it ? could be devoted to producing goods for ourselves which we can not now have . ' And such goods would certainly be marketable . For what American consumers saved through securing their cloth for nothing , they would presumably spend in buying such previously not-to-be-afforded goods . The inflow of foreign goods for which no return need be made , whether these foreign goods come as gifts , as interest on debts owed us by foreigners or foreign governments , or as payment of the principal of such debts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ? 4 . Local Protection by Means of Precept and Sentiment ? The general philosophy underlying protection is perhaps more widespread than the actual advocacy of high tariff . For many persons who by tradition and inheritance favor and habitually vote for national tariff reduction are never theless unctious believers in a form of local protection by precept and sentiment , which involves the same principle . They endeavor , by continually reiterated precept , to create a sentiment in favor of buying " in the home town . " The hatred for the mail-order house , on the part of many local // merchants , sometimes becomes almost an obsession . And if it were not for the fact that the Federal constitution makes interference , by a state , with interstate commerce , impossible , there would very likely be tariffs or other legal obstacles put in the way of purchase , by consumers , from such out-of-town houses , at least when the mail-order houses in question were also outside the state . Yet the economics of the case is fairly simple . Suppose that a can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 70 cents can be bought from a mail-order house for 50 cents . In that case , to persuade the consumer that he ought to buy of the home merchant is , clearly , to occa sion him a loss of 20 cents . Does the community as a whole gain ? Clearly not , and there may be a net com community loss . Either the home dealer can meet the price of the mail-order house and remain in business or he can not . I f lie can , the partial suppression of competition through the development of a sentiment against buying out of town , as a result of which the home dealer is en abled to charge 70 cents instead of 50 , benefits him by 20 cents , by an amount , just equal to the amount lost by the consumer . One member of the community ( the dealer ) is 20 cents richer ; auot her ( the consumer ) is 20 cents poorer . The community as a whole is no better off . Suppose , however , that the home dealer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but would give up his business rather than do so . In that case it must be that either he or his clerks ' or both can find some other business more profit-able to him or them than to engage in selling these peaches at 50 cents , some business perhaps as profitable as to sell the peaches for 60 cents . Then when the consumer has to pay 70 cents for the home-purchased peaches and is made 20 cents poorer than he need be , the dealer and those associated with him are not 20 cents richer but only 10 cents richer . The dealer may be 20 cents richer than he // would otherwise be in that business but is only 10 cents richer than he might be in a different business . And if the local dealer would rather do something else than to take anything less than 70 cents , then the consumer loses 20 cents in order that the dealer may remain in his business and be only as well off as he would in any case be in an alternative business . There is here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail-order concern can always undersell a home-town concern or that the services offered are always easily comparable . But if a home concern can sell goods of equal quality more cheaply than an out-of-town concern , it does not need the protection of a sentiment against buying out of town . And the contention that the people of a town gain economically as a result of a sentiment which makes consumers buy at home goods purchasable elsewhere at an appreciably lower price , is absurd . The contention sometimes made that the home merchant pays taxes , contributes to local charities , etc. , and so " supports " the town and that he must be patronized to make this possible , is equally absurd . The home merchant would equally help to support the town if he got into some other business there , e.g. , if he helped to pay for goods brought into the town by making goods to send out . In case his next best alternative is to engage in business elsewhere , then the town , having a smaller population , is not so expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if all the additional money collected by the home merchant from the consumer , in excess of what he could collect under free competition , had to be contributed to the expenses of the town , the merchant could not congratulate himself on having added anything to his personal income ; while if only a part of this excess went towards the expenses of the town , the consumer could better afford to contribute to the needs of the town directly rather than by first contributing to the prosperity of the merchant .
