" Alec Draws a BookTt tttt ' . t ' , weeks later Alec descended one morning from his room in John Jay , in search of breakfast . He had overslept , and his first class was lost . He might as well take his time now , and start the day with a meal . I Ic would , of course , patronize the drugstore across the street , the corner one , opposite the hospital . Since Mimi had begun to work there , no other lunch counter had his trade. f lcr thinking , not Isis , had solved her problem . Though she could no longer afford college , she agreed with him that it would be a mistake to go home to St. Louis . Ile wanted to get a job , so they could marry . I ie was sure he could earn his living part of the day , and do his college work in the superfluous hours , and he had written to his father for a larger allowance to meet the sadly increasedcost of education , but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a supplementary note more urgent . The four dollars and twentyonecents , reduced to two-seventy-five by that Sunday morning breakfast at Childs , had melted completely the following day . These intervening40ALEC DRAWS A BOOK 41weeks he had subsisted on a loan from Tom , who was moved to penitence for his bad temper the night of the historic dance . Of course the Decemberallowance would soon arrive , but Mimi had proved herself independent . She had got a job as cashier at the drugstore , she had given up her room in the Barnard dormitory , and found a cheap place in the apartment over where she worked . Her energy awed him . She would make a wonderfulwife ! Several times he told her so . In the mail boxes in the corridor he found two letters . One was a singularly economical communicationto the effect that the Dean was in a hurry to see him . Alec had had one of those announcements before , but had forgotten about it . Perhaps he really ought to go . The other letter , post-marked Trenton , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear you have been studying . You forgot to tell me what . If you really need this money , I 'll send it , but if you 've been playing poker again , I 'll cut down your allowance . We had an agreement about that before you went to college . No one should play poker who can play as badly as you can . I 've referred your request to the Dean for his recommendation . See him ! " Your mother and your sisters send love . " Alec pushed back his battered hat , so he could42 BACHELOR-OF ARTSscratch his head . Breakfast would have to wait . No pleasure talking to Mimi with this crisis hanging over him ! He 'd get the Dean out of the way first . When he went through the open door of the office , the short , gray-haired man glanced up through his spectacles under his bushy eyebrows . Three other boys were standing before the judgmentseat , but Alec meant to the Dean something peculiarly urgent . " Let 's see  --  oh , yes  --  Hamilton ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The little room was the spot where the serious cases were treated . It had a desk near the window , and a swivel chair , and bookcases , and a very hard seat for the culprit to squirm on . The Dean took the swivel chair at the desk , bent one leg under him and sat on his foot . " Er  --  Hamilton  --  er  --  your father called me up from Trenton  --  several times , in fact . It 's a questionof your finances  --  or it was . As I understand it , your father was ready to increase your allowance if you stood well in your studies . He asked me for your record , and by Jove ! Hamilton , it 's practicallyvirgin ! So far as I can learn , you have n't done a thing . Several of your teachers deny that you are in their class . What 's wrong ? " Alec cleared his throat . " I 've been to all the classes , sir , several times . Some of them are swell . " ALEC DRAWS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What have you really been doing ? Your father suspects poker , or bridge . " " Not to excess , sir . I play a little bridge in the dorms , and some poker at the house since I was pledged " " That 's another matter , " interrupted the Dean . " They ca n't initiate you if you 're failing in all your subjects . It would n't be worth their while . " Alec was deeply shocked . " The initiation comes off day after tomorrow , sir ! They 've made all the preparations ! " The Dean refused to grieve . " They can cancel them . It wo n't be the first time . Your job is work ! When you leave this office , go to your next class , and when you 're through with the class , go to your room and open a book . Or , if , as I suspect , you do n't yet possess a book , go to the Library and draw one out . Anyone will show you where the Library is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You mean I ca n't be initiated ? " " You 're on probation for a fortnight . Then I may send you home to Trenton . If you earn the right to stay , I 'll decide whether fraternity life is what you need . " Under the clean-cut words Alec detected what seemed to him a contradiction . He had occasion to notice it many times again . The short man with the gray hair and the unfoolable eyes was kind , but44 BACHELOR-OF ARTSthe kindness did n't interfere with his saying what he meant . Alec saw himself lost to Phi Phi Phi , and felt suddenly guilty for having let the house down after they had put faith in him . What was worse , he could n't face Mimi . If he could n't marry her when he had proposed and she had accepted him , at least poverty is an accident which may happen to the best of men . But to be kept out of the fraternity just because he had n't done his lessons !  --  why , she 'd think him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he began , in a tone of anguish , " let them initiate me ! " When you deserve it ! " " Now , sir ! You do n't know what it means ! If I join the fraternity , I 'll make up the class work  --  I swear I will ! I 'll cut out anything else you ask . But if you break it off , the fellows wo n't want me again . They 'll say I 'm a wash-out . " They may be right . " Alec got to his feet , awkward but unafraid . Watching him , the Dean saw he was at his best when he had his back to the wall . " I 'll leave collegeat once , sir . If I 'm a wash-out , there 's no use staying . " " Do you want to stay ? " Alec met his eye , man to man . " Yes , sir , it 's a swell place , but I want to get married . " Nothing surprised the Dean . It was the secretALEC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those old-fashioned ideals myself , " he said . " You 've found the right girl already , eh ? " " Yes , sir . Maybe I 'm not a student . I sha n't ask Father to help me longer  --  I ' 11 get a job and marry . " That sounds authentic , " said the Dean . " See here , Hamilton , perhaps she interferes with the work . That ought n't to be ! If she loved you , she 'd want you to get on . " Alec hastened to her defense . " She works more than I do . She earns her living . She 's a straight shooter . " The Dean looked at him so hard that Alec became a little uncomfortable . He was standing hat in hand , ready to leave , but hypnotized by that long stare . He was n't prepared for what came next . " Go ahead with the initiation , Hamilton . It would n't be kind to the working world to turn you loose on it . As a wage-earner you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to get several things out of your system , but I believe you 'll keep your word . If you do n't put your mind on your books now , you 've cheated ! " Outside of Hamilton Hall Alec remembered that he needed his breakfast , but he went to his English class . They were holding it temporarily in the School of Business . Alec got there late , to the46 BACHELOR-OF ARTSannoyance of Billy Bridge , the instructor , and it seemed best to sit in the last row , behind the W 's , instead of climbing over the G 's to reach the H 's . Bridge would read out an essay which evidently he did n't like , and then he 'd ask your opinion . If you said you did n't like it , he 'd ask you why not , and you 'd be in trouble , unless you had listened carefully to the reading  --  which you probably had n't . Bridge had a husky voice , and himself hesitated to give a positive criticism . Alec spent the hour watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wondered if they agreed about this waste of sixty minutes of youth . As he walked to the corner drugstore he thought how glad he was not to be a disgrace to the fraternity , and how glorious it would be to earn his living and marry . A nice little apartment somewhere , and no compulsion to say good-night just when the conversation began to be interesting ! She 'd be a swell person to have around all the time . In the drugstore she was at her desk , the red hair more vivid because of the black cotton smock . There was the familiar smile at the edge of her lips , and in her eyes the serenity which had first attractedhim . She liked her job . She liked her own courage in taking it . She liked Alec . She liked life . Swell girl ! When he had commanded his coffee and egg , he leaned over her desk . ALEC DRAWS A BOOK 47 " I 'm going to be initiated day after tomorrow , " he said . She shared his pleasure . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Not too much . I see it in the right light . " She laughed . " The Dean and I , " he went on , " have just been talking . " She laughed again . " I thought that would come . " See here , " he protested , " what 's got into you ? You were sharp with me last night too . " The boy at the soda fountain claimed his attention . " Here 's your egg . Do you want toast ? " Since the morning and his hunger were far advanced , Alec ordered toast . He let the egg wait a moment . " What , " said Mimi , " were you telling the Dean  --  or was he telling you ? " " You known darn well ! He thinks I 'd better study . I explained I 'm going to study , and I 'm going to get married . Say , Mimi , let 's get mar-ried ! " She did n't laugh at him now . She flashed a sudden , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was conscious of a man approachingto pay his check . She spoke quickly . " I wish you would n't say that any more ! It makes me feel guilty . I would n't for the world48 BACHELOR-OF ARTSspoil your life ! Of course you must do your lessons ! And grow up ! That 's why our people sent us to school . " He flushed red , but he had to stand aside for the tall man behind him , and since the tall man had a lot to say , he went over to the counter and began on the egg , now a little cold . The jerker poured him hot coffee . For a few moments he wrestled with his mortification , as he chewed his food . She had told him that he was not yet grown up ! The Dean had said he was not yet fit to work ! They both thought him too callow to be a great lover . Gosh ! This simple but doleful meditation came to an end as he grew aware that the man at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mimi . It was n't business that held them . They were laughing as well as talking  --  Mimi had n't laughed that way at any of Alec 's remarks since the first night at the John Jay dance , and he could detect in her voice an unmistakable respect for the tall man . Perhaps something more ! Alec turned around with unconcealed curiosity . He did n't like the looks of the fellow . Too conceited . Where had he seen shim ? Gosh ! That night at the dance  --  standing beside the Dean ! That professor of history  --  Mimihad said every one adored him . What was the name , now ? Oh , yes  --  Woolsey . Well , Alec did n't adore him at all . A prof ought to haveALEC DRAWS A BOOK 49other things to do than talk with a girl in a drugstorein the middle of the morning . Even when they are not lecturing , do n't they have to read , or something ? Light though his pocketbook was at the moment , he ordered more toast , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it took all day ! He would learn somehow where and when Mimi met him , and if she was one of those who adored him . He gave another look , to see whether the intruder was mature enough for matrimony . Not mature at all , he would say  --  just darn self-confident ! When the second portion of toast had been consumed , Alec busied himself with a succession of cigarettes . He tried not to listen to what they were saying , but when Professor Woolsey at last tore himself away , it did sound as though they were making a date . Alec rose with resolute deliberation , studying his thirty-five-cent check , and turning sidewise so that Mimi could see him slap down a five-cent tip . Usually he gave no tips , but perhaps a mature person would . He paid his check without a word , then stood looking at her . " I told the Dean if I stay in college , it 's only because he asked me to . He knows I 'd rather earn my living and marry you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not serious . I 'll show you ! If I get you an engagement ring , and all that , and find a job , 50 BACHELOR-OF ARTSand rent an apartment somewhere , will you marry me ? " " I wo n't let you leave college . " But ca n't I get married and still study ? and work ? " Because she laughed , he spoke out with the firmnesswhich had impressed the Dean . " I may be young  --  I know I 'm not an old fossil like that thing you were just talking with and I wo n't come here again , but if you 'd like to marry me , these are my plans  --  I 'm going to get initiated , see ? The fellows have been white to me , and I wo n't let them down . I get my allowance tomorrowor next day . Right after the initiation , the next morning , I 'll get you an engagement ring . Here , wrap this paper around your finger , for the size . Then we 'll have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you off  --  you do n't get engaged every day . That afternoon I 'll go downtown and land a job . You watch me ! I 'll bet we 'll be married in a week ! What d' you say ? " His earnestness pleased her . " I 'm afraid it 's not so easy as you think . We ca n't support ourselves yet . " You mean , I ca n't . " " I 'm not going to spoil your life . " " You do n't love me ! You would n't hesitate to spoil it if you loved me ! " ALEC DRAWS A BOOK 51She leaned forward across her desk . " You 've no idea how much I love you , how much I want to marry you ! " His happy manner returned . " Hold out your finger ! " She let him measure it . " If you do n't see me for a couple of days , it 's because I 'm training for the initiation . I 'll drop in if I can . But right after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next morning ! " He gave her hand a squeeze . " Alec , you must n't lose your college course . " " Do we have to go into that again ? I 'll have you and the college course , both ! " " Alec , dear ! Do we need any engagement ring ? " " Say ! Are you getting cold feet ? Yes or no ! " " Do n't shout , Alec ! You 're making a scene . " " Will you be waiting for me  --  the day afterinitiation ? " Her love was in her voice . " I 'll be waiting . " He did catch a glimpse of her twice , before the initiation , and it stirred him deeply to contemplate the woman who would be his soul mate for life . He had n't realized that this getting married was so brilliant an adventure . His own parents had seemed to him emotionally burnt out , just good friends like all old people . They had their little jokes , they teased each other , they liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't love . Alec sus-52 BACHELOR-OF ARTSpected that in the long generations of his eminently solid family he was the first to discover love . With Mimi 's help , of course . He 'd prove to her that he was grown up ! When his allowance arrived , with his father 's habitual promptness , the check was ten dollars larger than usual . Alec caught the sarcasm of this gesture . He had told his father that at least an additional hundred and fifty was needed to square him with the world . Still , the ten would come in handy . He would pay back Tom the loan on which he had been living  --  not that Tom was pressing him for it , but if they were swearing eternal brotherhood , it would be graceful to settle up and start even . Tom , encouraged at getting his twenty-five back so soon , remarked casually , " Why not settle for the initiation fee too , while you 're in funds ? " Alec had forgotten the initiation fee . A good round seventy-five ! He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! But since there was no way to avoid the obligation , he surrendered , and went back to his habitual poverty . With care he might feed himself till Christmas , and buy a ticket home . That job would now be more necessary than ever ! If he only knew someone who had an engagementring to lend , he could borrow it till he caught up ! ALEC DRAWS A BOOK 53Temporarily , during the more active passages of the initiation , he got into the spirit of the ceremony , saw himself an important link in the immortaltradition of the house , and bathed his soul in a diffused brotherly love . But when one of the alumni started to deliver the charge , Alec 's thoughts turned to Mimi . The elderly brother was slightly pot-bellied , and the library lamp shone mercilessly on the bulge . Alec realized that alumni are not so hot . The speaker seemed to be recalling something said at his own initiation twenty years before , or perhaps this was the speech he usually gave at kindergartens , and had got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pin in Alec 's waistcoatand gave him the right hand of fellowship , Tom put an extra pressure into the shake . " Buck up ! " he whispered , as he passed . " Do n't take it so hard ! " Alec grinned resolutely , to show the brethren how happy he was . Then everybody fell on the eats , for which , of course , the initiation fees paid . Jim slapped him on the back . " I 'd no idea you 'd be so deeply touched . I thought at one time you were going to cry . " Alec resumed the heroic grin . " Ah , shut up ! " Jim pinched his arm affectionately . " When the crowd thins , come out with Tom and me. " 54 BACHELOR-OF ARTSThey repaired to the Gold Rail , next to Childs , and settled in the booth furthest from the door , on the south side . " The question now is , " began Tom , " shall we feed him beer at first , and educate him gradually , or shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact is , " said Alec , " I like beer . " " You 're being initiated , " said Tom . " Do n't talk back . Three Scotches . " " Well , now that you 're in , " said Jim , " I 'm glad we pledged you . Most of the old grads think we might have done worse . What made you look so grouchy ? Anything on your mind ? " Since the highball had n't yet arrived , Alec had control of his manners . " It was a swell initiation . I was just thinking . " Tom scowled . " About your girl , I suppose . You ought to see these things in a big way . You belong to us now . With a fair break , we 'll make a man of you . Keep off the women . " Remembering that he was , at once , their guest and their new-created brother , Alec avoided debate . " I 'll try not to let you down . " The waiter brought the drinks  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage of consciousness , Alec found himself in his bed in John Jay , with Tom by his side , both of them fully dressed . The alarm clock , though it waved before his eye , seemed to indicate half-past five . HeALEC DRAWS A BOOK 55understood . One of them must have had too much Scotch , and the other had brought him home , in the spirit of brotherhood , and watched the night out . Tom was still asleep . Far gone , evidently . It must have been Alec who brought him home and protected his slumbers . Alec was willing to explorethe situation further , but his head ached . He collapsed by Tom 's side . Before noon they woke in their right minds , had a bath , shaved with Alec 's razor , and dressed for the daytime  --  Tom making free with the dark gray suit , which had been one of Mrs. Hamilton 's mistakes . " Let 's step over to the drugstore , " he suggested , " for coffee . " " The delicatessen , " countered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clung to his head with both hands . " Do n't say delicatessen to me ! In my present condition the word makes me sick ! My brain 's splitting ! Let 's go back to the Gold Rail and have an eye-opener with the coffee . " " We 'll have to hurry , then . I 've an awfully important date . " But the eye-opener did more than cure the headache . It brought back that frame of beatitude in which last night he had swum . By high noon he was making Tom another speech about the opportunitiesfound at Columbia by the studious , and56 BACHELOR  --  OF ARTShis own oratory reminded him of his agreement with the Dean . " By God ! I promised him to go straight to the Library and take out a book , and now I will ! " Tom was deeply moved . " I will too , by God ! " They went arm in arm up Broadway , through the gate at 115th past 1 Iarticy and journalism , across South Court . Tom would have entered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought you ought to use the front steps the first time you go . They noticed the Trustees ' room on the right , and would have consulted the Trustees , but the door was locked . Slightly annoyed , they crossed to the Secretary 's Office opposite , and asked where the books were , and how you got one of them . The young woman at the telephone switchboard thought they were looking for a catalog , but when she learned their higher purpose , she taught them the intricate way to the loan desk . " Which book , " asked Alec , " shall I begin on ? " " I heard a good title once , " said Tom , The Anatamyof Melancholy . " Alec shook his head . " That does n't come in any of my courses  --  I do n't think it does . " " ' What are you taking ? " " American History , and " Why not get a history ? " In the card catalog they found a History ofALEC DRAWS A BOOK 57America , and Alec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other treatments of the same subject . Anyway , American history is American history . The attendant at the desk consulted green or blue cards in a box on the shelf behind him . He then wrote something on the slip and handed it back to Alec . " That volume 's out . Will you select another ? " Alec had never been more sensible of the injusticeof the world . " I wish no other ! That book or nothing ! " The attendant was patient . " There are several copies of it , but they 're reserved . Why do n't you try some other history of the United States ? " Alec leaned over the desk , adding impact to his eloquence . " If you had come to college to read a certain book , " he began , " if your parents , at great sacrifice , had trained you to set your heart on it , and if when you got to the library they told you it was out , how would you feel ? " " I 'm sorry , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ select the history you want ? Any edition but this . " With dignity Alec steered around to see which other people wanted library service . Three , to be precise  --  a girl with spectacles , a fat man with a cane over his arm , and that dark boy whom he had noticed among the W 's . He smiled at Alec , 58 BACHELOR-OF ARTSbut the greeting was not returned . Alec stood framing a crushing reply to the attendant , till Tom pulled him away . " Let 's go back to the Gold Rail . Who said study ? " But Alec was faithful . " I promised the Dean to take that book out ! Did n't I say this University is mismanaged ? I 'm going to tell the President ! " " A lot you are ! " " D' you dare me ? Come on ! " In the Secretary 's Office the bewildered young woman at the switchboard learned that they were a committee from the Phi Phi house delegated to register a complaint with the President about the conduct of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rail to where the Assistant Secretarywas sitting . He surveyed them cautiously . Have you an appointment with the President ? " Alec was about to say they had , but caught himself in time and took safer ground . " We understand he is free at this hour . " The Assistant Secretary grew more cautious . You are a delegation from the fraternity ? " " We are . " " And your errand has to do with the Library ? " With the misconduct of the Library . " The Assistant Secretary reached slowly for his telephone , and whispered into it . The reply he got seemed to surprise him . ALEC DRAWS A BOOK 59 " I 'll show you how to use the elevator , " he said . " The President happens to be free . " Once in the electric cage which lifted the Presidentand all his visitors to his august eminence , they remembered to press the right button , and emerged in a large and quiet room , lined with books , and decorated with pictures and dignified memorabilia . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a few devoted runners loping around the track . John Jay was off at the left . From this angle it did n't look so bad . The President 's desk was absolutely clear . It seemed to Alec unjust that presidents have nothing to do , but there was no time to pursue the thought . This particular President was awfully quickmoving . He was getting out of his chair  --  he was shaking hands with them , a powerful grip  --  he was telling them to sit down  --  they were sitting down ! Behind his desk he was walking up and down like a panther . " Well , boys , what is it ? " " Mr. President , " said Alec , we bring you the complaints of the serious students in our fraternity . This University advertises that it has a library , and the public are misled into believing that in the librarythere are some books . I never would have come here if I had n't heard there were some books . " The President stopped his exercise and stared at them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6o BACHELOR  --  OF ARTS " None whatever . I 've just put it to the test . I asked for a book , and it was out . " With great dignity Alec laid before the President the library slip . Prexy laughed . " Is this a hazing joke , or are you doing this on a bet ? Of course , a book may be out . What are you reading ? " He glanced at the title on the slip . " Why , there are dozens of historiesof America ! Try some other author . " He spoke quickly , and the ends of his remarks were as vigorous as the beginnings , but his tone indicated a rapidly falling interest . He had a wonderfulgift for helping you guess when it was time to leave . Alec , however , did not let him off . " Mr. President , we are in earnest ! If only one book now and then were out , we could , of course , get on somehow , but I 've reason to believe that the vast majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only for its architecture . It 's nothing but a shell . " " Nonsense ! " " I 'll prove it to you , Mr. President . You choose any dozen titles , and we 'll go downstairs and try to draw them . " The President smiled , seeing perhaps a way to get rid of them . He took from his desk a yellow pad . " Very well . Name the titles . " Alec hedged . You name them , Mr. President . " At this command the President looked puzzled , ifALEC DRAWS A BOOK 61not annoyed , but the smile returned , and he began writing very fast . " Emerson 's Essays , First Series  --  Ruskin , Crown of Wild Olives  --  Shakespeare 's Works Tom interrupted . " That 's in a good many volumes , is n't it ? " " The Globe edition , " said the President firmly .

" " How about Fenimore Cooper ? " asked Tom . " The Spy , " said the President . " There 's that speech on Conciliation , " continued Tom vaguely . " Burke , " said the President . " Here , that 's enough ! " " Make it ten , " insisted Alec . " It 's your turn , " said the President . " The Anatomy of Melancholy . " The President laughed . " There you are ! I do n't know what this is all about , but I gravely suspect you ! " To get rid of them sooner he unlocked the door which lets you out on the stairway . " Come again . " " We expect , " said Alec , " to be back in a minute . " Twelve minutes , to be precise , and the Assistant62 BACHELOR-OF ARTSSecretary held them up for another five , before he got the President 's consent . Once more the electric elevator moved them up slowly . The President was standing behind his desk with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's it now ? " Alec laid down on the President 's desk , as though he were dealing cards , nine library slips , all marked " Out . " He then turned to Tom and relieved him of something he was carrying under his arm . It was a ponderous edition of The Anatomy of Melancholy . The two boys grinned in triumph . " You see , sir ? That 's just about the chance we have of getting a book . Would you like to suggestanother list , to make sure ? " The President began pushing an electric button on his desk , so hard that Alec feared the machine might break . " Give me the Librarian ! " They sat in silence . The President had the receiverto his ear . Suddenly he thrust his head forward , and his eyes glared . " What ! The Librarian is out ! Oh , he 's at a committee , is he ? Well , I wish to see him , at his earliest convenience ! " The President put up the telephone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more trouble , let me know . " This time he sent them down in the elevator . " Good-bye . " ALEC DRAWS A BOOK 63The intellectual exercise involved in meeting the great man had cleared their heads slightly . He did n't invite us to come again , " remarked Tom . " Say , they 'll murder you at that Library desk ! You 'll need a body-guard , if ever you try for another book . " " This one , " said Alec , " will last me quite a while . I wonder what it 's about ! " They were in the final stage of their hang-over , their soul still united by what was left of the artificiallystimulated beatitude . Deciding to investigatethe book together , they repaired to Alec 's room in John Jay , where they spread it out on the bed and turned the massive pages . With youth 's instinct for such things they got directly at the scandalous passages , and Tom began to read without skipping , but Alec grew thoughtful . This chapter was about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another part about how to cure it . The fellow who wrote that book thought people would want to cure themselves of being in love !

He had been drinkingwith Tom and Jim at the Gold Rail  --  he had been spending the morning with the President in the Library . He had forgotten Mimi ! All this time she was waiting for him ! Had he not witnessed64 BACHELOR-OF ARTSthis infidelity with his own eyes , he never would have believed it ! Tom was greatly surprised to see his new fraternitymate stretch out on the bed and begin to sob . " What the devil ! What 's happened to you ?

" If she drops you just for being lit at your own initiation , you 're darned lucky not to marry her ! I did n't know she was a prig .

He took her to the Claremontfor a grand dinner , and explained why he could n't , and to his surprise he discovered that she had n't expected him to  --  not yet . He did not mention the engagement ring , nor did she . When he went home for Christmas , he missed her . Poor thing , she had to stay in New York and take the cash at the drugstore . Trenton was full of parties , and he was glad to see his folks , and all that , but he never was so content to bring a vacationto an end . When he got his Christmas presents paid for , and something saved up on his allowance , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after the mid-year exams . They took a lot of time , and he just squeaked through . The Dean was n't a bit complimentary . Meanwhile he and Mimi saw each other at dances and at meals  --  breakfast at the counter near her desk , dinner at Childs . It was a mild winter . March was snowless . He fancied spring in the air . Perhaps it was the season , perhaps it was the re-66ALEC IS FOR PEACE 67action to the excitement he had been living through , perhaps it was loss of faith in himself , since his hope to marry Mimi was deferred . In his work he went to pieces , and he consoled himself with poker and other distractions . He was , as he knew , not at his best ; conscience made him irritable . He spent as much time with Mimi as she would permit . Though she liked to see him , she urged more industry at his college tasks . His fraternity mates blamed her for Alec 's fading-out . One mid-afternoon the elevator stopped at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his heels . They marched down the corridor single file , keeping step . At Alec 's room they paused for a second and listened . " He 's at the drugstore with her now ! " said Albert . Tom knocked . A discouraged voice sounded from inside . They opened the door and surveyed their problem . He had turned the desk chair around so he could rest his feet on the bed . His feet , of course , were clad in white shoes . Though indoors , he was wearing his ancient hat . By way of grudging hospitality he withdrew his feet from the bed , and his brethren sat on it . Also with their hats on . " Here 's your mail , Alec , " said Tom , giving him two letters . The top one , as the envelope showed , was from the Dean. 68 BACHELOR-OF ARTS " Where 'd you get this ? " " In the box downstairs . " " Damn you ! " said Alec . " You 've no right to tamper with my mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Tom . " You 'd better read it . " Alec stuck his finger in the envelope and pulled it open . Only a line , suggesting that he call on the Dean at his earliest convenience . " I 've had those before ! " " Not one like this . The Dean told Albert . That 's why I brought it by hand . " " What 's he want ? " " When he mailed that note , he was thinking of expulsion . Now he may give you one last chance . He 'll decide after he 's talked with you tomorrow morning . But this time , if you forget to see him , you 're out ! " The other letter , the unopened one , slid to thefloor . Alec picked it up and threw it on the desk . " I doubt if I shall call on him , " he said . " Wedo n't speak the same language . " " Does the house mean nothing to you ? " asked Tom , as though he were applying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you want to , but the rest of us get the disgrace . " " I told him you 'd be there tomorrow , " said Albert , " and I promised to coach you in math . " Alec shook his head . " I 'm through . " ALEC IS FOR PEACE 69 " You probably are , " said Tom in disgust , but we 're going to make an effort to save you . Your delegation 's too small as it is . The house ca n't get on with only four freshmen . " " Five , " corrected Alec . " Not after tomorrow morning , " corrected Tom , " unless you reform . You were all right till you met that red-headed dame at the drugstore . " Alec became combative . " You lay off Mimi ! " " I like her myself , " said Tom , " but in moderation . Your love has reduced you to idiocy . You forget to go to classes , you do n't come to the house . When we made you write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your name . He showed it to Al-bert . " " It is n't love , " said Alec , " it 's the Dean and my father , and the old folks generally . Why should I study law ? Why does n't Father do it himself ? Why should I inherit the Trenton iron foundry ? I want to be somebody ! " " I recognize the grounds of your complaint , " said Albert , " but you ca n't blame your father for getting on his hind legs when he sees your bills , and if you 're studying nothing but Mimi and poker , you might as well do it at home . " Alec for the first time smiled . " I thought of that just before you came in . I 'm going home . " He laid the Dean 's letter on its opened envelope , tore the paper into small squares , and dropped them70 BACHELOR-OF ARTSinto the waste basket . Tom permitted him to finish the gesture . " Lucky you do n't have to show the invitation to get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shove you through the door of his office tomorrow morning . Why do n't you buck up ? " Alec got to his feet , stretched , put his hands in his pockets . " Fellows , I 've worked it out this way . I 'm nearly of age . " " Calendar or psychological ? " inquired Tom . " I 'm fed up with college , " continued Alec , unembarrassed . " I 'm glad I 'm in the house , of course , and all that . " " If you had n't come to college , " put in Albert , you would never have heard of Mimi . Stay a while and see if there is n't another important subject . " " Will you shut up ? I 'm serious ! College is n't a man 's job . They feed you what the Middle Ages lived on , and if you ca n't digest it , they fire you . I 'll leave now , get to work , and marry Mimi . " " You 're cuckoo , " said Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , I 'll wring her neck ! " " You two must have something to do this afternoon , " said Alec . " I wo n't keep you . " " If we had anything to do , " snapped Tom , " would we have wasted ourselves here ? Coming to the house tonight ? " Alec shook his head . ALEC IS FOR PEACE 71 " Bert and I , " said Tom , " will call for you at ten in the morning . Mind you 're up ! " " Not going ! " " I said ten , promptly . " They left him , and he called after them to shut the door , and then he shut it himself . He stood disconsolatein the middle of his narrow room . Now that they were gone , he seemed anything but defiant . He was thinking that he liked the place . And the house . And Tom was a good egg , to take the trouble . And Albert , that Phi Beta Kappa slob , who hobnobbed with the Dean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he would n't mind studying , if they taught anything sensible . And his father would be angry as the devil . The folks would n't understand about Mimi . Well , it was too late now . His eye fell on the other letter , a long envelope , resting on the desk . He opened it . A list of names lined the left side of the page . The officers and charter members . What was the society , anyway ? Oh , it was a bunch of pacifists . They wanted to know whether he intended to fight , in case there ever was a war . Hm ! He read the body of the missive , having first skipped from the top to the bottom . Not bad , when you took it sentence by sentence. 72 BACHELOR-OF ARTSIn Europe the university student is in the forefront of every liberal movement , but in this country we submit to the unintelligent control of our least liberal elders . When their blunders bring on a war , we have to do the fighting . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen it in that light before . The remedy is to warn them in advance that we will not fight . " He remained staring across the room , with the letter in his hand . If he went in for pacifism , the fellows would ride him . It had n't been his temperament . He had had occasion to thrash a large number of his friends . On the other hand , these words said what he felt . It was all the fault of the old folks . That fool uncle of his , who left a legacy not to be touched till he was twenty-one ! If things were right , he could marry Mimi now . At the bottom of the page , under a thoughtful line of perforations , was a detachable inch or so for his signature . He drew his fountain pen from his jacket , shook it on the rug , signed on the line , tore off the slip , printed the address of the Pacifist Societyon the envelope , applied mucilage to a stamp which had been salvaged by steaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IS FOR PEACE 73down to the street , and dropped the envelope in the corner box . It was half past four . The drugstore shifted cashiers at five . In thirty minutes Mimi would be a free woman . He would break the news to her that from now on he was for peace . In the drugstore she was busy at her desk , acceptingtribute from a line of youths who had been fortifying themselves with hot chocolate . When they lingered to try on her their wit and their compliments , she realized how well she knew men , havingknown Alec . As he sauntered in , she saw his look of elation , and the quick glance of annoyance at the flattering band of customers who loitered in front of her desk . She made herself more intensively agreeable to the customers . He pushed his hat back on his head , lounged in a chair at the nearest table , and drummed his fingers on the glass top . She had on a new dress . A bargain , probably . He resolved to remember to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the Dean , and getting fired , but he did n't see how to begin . He affected a light tone . " Let 's eat at Childs ! " " Good boy ! I 'm being asked out to dinner ! " " Well  --  supper . " You mean you 're broke again ? " " Woman , I 've all of two dollars and seventy-five cents on my person , but I 'm dedicated to a cause ! " 74 BACHELOR  --  OF ARTSAlready they were walking toward Childs . " Mimi , I can never be a soldier ! " " What made you think they 'd take you ? " " I 'm a pacifist ! " " Why , you said they were a mess ! " He dropped the elbow by which he was steering her , and she laughed . He thought she might questionhim , but since she did not , he took the elbow again . " This youth movement , you know  --  I 'm in it . I 've signed a pledge never to fight . " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you had n't signed ? " He avoided side issues . " The way to prevent war , is to refuse to fight . " " Which war is this , Alec ? " He again removed his sustaining hand , placed it in his trousers pocket , executed a few casual dance steps on the sidewalk , and whistled softly , to indicate self-possession . " You 're darned unresponsive this evening ! " " If you wo n't help , " she said , " they ca n't start a war without you . I can see that ! " He stopped , to stare at her . " Gosh , but you 've got a chip on your shoulder ! What 's biting you ? " She put her arm through his , and headed him for Childs again . " You baby ! Is the Dean angry ? What are you flunking in now ? " He smiled firmly . " The Dean and I have nothingALEC IS FOR PEACE 75in common . There are more important things than marks ! " " If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mused , " you would n't be here . I wish I knew that man  --  I 'd ask him what he sees in you ! " " He probably wishes he were in my shoes , " said Alec modestly . " He 's not a bad sort , at bottom . But when they ask him whether he 'll fight , he must say yes , to keep his job . " They had reached the portals of Childs . She squeezed his arm as they separated to get through the revolving door . " How much money did you say you had ? I could eat ! " Inside the door , he took off his hat . The room was crowded . He looked around for a table . Against the further wall a youth was eating alone . Alec 's heart sank . " There 's Tom ! " Mimi seized his arm . " Let 's have a table by our-selves . " In the circumstances , it was his own wish . Tom might mention the Dean prematurely . Besides , he wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cowardly , or grouchy , or something . Tom was an awfully good egg . He pushed Mimi across the room . " We 'll talk to him a while , and afterwards we 'll do something by ourselves . " " Hello , Mimi ! " said Tom without rising . " Join76 BACHELOR-OF ARTSthe party . Jim will be here in a minute . How 's the girl ? " Except for a certain subdued note , his manner was normal . Alec saw that Tom did not intend to give him away . His spirits rose . " She 's in a low mood . She hoped to eat in select society , that is with me , but I tell her a little slummingnow and then is good for us . What 'll you have , Mimi ? How about an oyster stew ? " He gave her a meaningful glance , to recall the two dollars and seventy-five cents . " I 'm off oysters , " she said sweetly . " I 'll take a steak . " " One steak and one oyster stew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not drinking coffee , are you ? " " When I can get it . " " Make it one coffee ! " " Does n't he give you a salad or a dessert ?

" Tell him , Alec , " said she , " he might as well know the worst . " " I 'm against war . " He announced it in a low voice , portentously . " How will you have that steak , sir ? " asked the waiter . ALEC IS FOR PEACE 77 " Rare to medium ! " said Alec , loud and sharp . " I told you once ! " You really did n't , " contradicted Mimi with a caressing smile . " I 'm having the steak , and I want it well done . " " Make it well done and be quick about it  --  we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Tom , you do n't wish to be quarrelsome ?

Josh all you want , but I mean it ! I wish I 'd gone to collegein Europe ! The students there use their minds ! " Tom and Mimi exchanged glances , and Alec felt himself getting hot . " They 're in the forefront of all the radical movements ! " Tom applauded . " Where did you get that forefront ? That 's a good line ! " Alec did not tell where he had found it . You feel the same as I , Tom , but you compromise ! " " There 's Jim now ! " exclaimed Tom , waving toward the door . " Hey , Jim !

" Something light , " he commanded with dignity , " and a cup of strong coffee . I 've a long evening 's work . " Once more he rubbed his care-worn forehead . " Scrambled eggs , romaine salad with French dressing , strong coffee . " He folded his hands , and attended to Alec . " What were you saying ? " " He 's a Red ! " said Tom . " I 'm not ! " " Are you sure you 're not ? " asked Jim , trying out his technique in cross-examination . " I 'm opposed to war , that 's all ! " " He said you were a compromiser , " insisted Tom .

He tried his oyster stew , and went on . " When they are in trouble , they expect us to get them out . " ALEC IS FOR PEACE 79Jim looked up from his plate . Has the Dean appealed to you for aid ? " He would if there was a war ! They support the government and they send us off to fight , while they stay home safe and fan the recruiting , and when we get shot , they stick another gold star on the flag , and orate !

This hot air of yours has taught me what a pacifist is ! You 're afraid ! " Alec clinched his fists . You say that onceagain ! " " Keep your shirt on and finish your oyster stew , " advised Tom .

" remarked the Dean , as soon as the bail had been supplied and the damaged student let out of his cage . " Yes , sir , " replied Alec , with perfect respect . We are here . " " Well then , " continued the Dean , " unless you like these quarters , we might all go home . " " Yes , sir . " " By the way , " said the Dean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from me today ? " " A letter , sir ? " " It was indeed a letter , " said the Dean , " but itmay have gone astray . It often does . No matter . I 'd like a word with you in the morning . " " Early , sir ? " " The earlier the better ! " " I 'm sorry , sir , I ca n't . I 've an engagement . I 'm to be married . " " Quite so ! " said the Dean . " Of course ! But even after that perhaps you would be willing to speak to me . You will marry at nine , let us say , and you are wanted in the court at ten , and having paid your fine , you will , I hope , be at my office promptly at eleven .

" I have n't studied his92 BACHELOR-OF ARTShabits to that extent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At eleven , then ? " " Yes , sir . " By morning matrimony had slipped from Alec 's mind . He was too busy raising money for his fine . At eleven promptly he crossed the threshold of the Dean 's torture chamber . " I expected your friends with you . " " They 've dropped me , sir . They told me last night to go to hell . " " You 're no fool , " said the Dean , " which makes it harder to excuse you . You 're wasting your time , your father 's money , and my patience . " " I can see that , sir , " admitted Alec . " I know ' I 've wasted my time . " " You do n't put your mind on what you are doing . You might as well be walking in your sleep .

But your father and IALEC IS FOR PEACE 93have been talking on the telephone . We 've decided to let you stay for another month . " Alec thought of the letter to the President . " Perhaps I might as well go now , sir . " " Ca n't you make an effort ? Be a man , Alec ! " Alec walked to the dormitory , not happy . The reprieve would be only for a day . When the Presidentshould read that letterFrom habit he stooped at the janitor 's mail boxes , to see if there was anything for him . One envelope . He stood in the corridor staring at it . A plain envelope , with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's name and address on the front . Also some printed words in red , " RETURNED FOR POSTAGE .

And another ten for losing the bet ! Twenty in all ! Gosh ! eo , IVAv. , Alec Has a CarA FEW days later Alec waited again in the drugstore till a group of customers had paid their checks . Then he leaned over and whispered confidentially . " I 've written again to the old man , for a raise in my allowance . I told him how much I owe , but I could string it out from month to month , if he 'd send me a little more . " " As a matter of fact , " said Mimi , " why should he ? " Alec straightened up .

" I thought you 'd like to know , but I 'll be going along ! " A stout woman interrupted , to pay for a jar of cold cream . Alec waited , for a more dramatic exit after she had gone . Mimi did not urge him to stay . He leaned on the desk again . " I just gave him the total . " Her interest revived . " How much was it ? " 94ALEC HAS A CAR 95 " Three hundred and fifty-three dollars and thirty-four cents . " " Alec ! You could n't owe so much ! " Not a cent more nor less ! " " How awful ! Alec , I do n't believe it .

" Alec flushed slightly . " Do n't get hot ! I borrowedthe money , and now he needs it . " She studied the list again . " You do n't owe Tom two tens ! " " Yes , I do . I bet I would write the President what I thought of him . When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ten . But the letter came back , because we forgot to put a stamp on it .

I sha n't need it nearly so bad when I 'm twenty-one ! " " Even if you had it now , " protested Mimi , " that 's a lot of money ! I could live for six months on your debts ! " He resented the criticism . " It 's not much , if you consider how long I 've owed it . " When she laughed , he lost his temper , and then she laughed harder . " What a kid you are !

He did not appear the next day , neither morning98 BACHELOR-OF ARTSnor afternoon , nor the day after that . She was not surprised . He always studied conscientiously when he was broke . But the following afternoon he came into the drugstore with signs of joy all over him . There was no shadow upon their love , and the economic crisis must have passed . Through the grilled window of her desk he thrust a letter . " Dear SonIf there is an adding machine at the University , and if they will trust you with it , I suggest that you run off those debts of yours and see what they really come to .

Your mother persistsin believing that you will yet be a credit to the family . " " Is n't he a darling ? " exclaimed Alec as Mimilifted her somewhat perturbed eyes from the lastline . " In an emergency , the old man always rises ! " " But how did he know about me ? " she asked . " Or the poker ? I thought you sent him just thetotal ?

" Yes , that 's right  --  six hundred and thirty-six dollars and sixty-six cents . " " It 's really only five hundred and eighty-six dollars and sixty-six cents , " said Alec , as though the difference were immaterial , " because I 've drawn fifty dollars in cash , and as soon as you 're through here , we 'll go up to Ben Riley 's and celebrate . " " Ben Riley 's ? " The Arrowhead . It 's a place Jim told me about  --  he goes there , when he 's tired of studying law . It 's up beyond Van Cortland Park .

" She came out in front of the desk , and stood close to him . " Alec dear , we ca n't afford Ben Riley 's , nor a ring . You are all I want ! If we could be married , I would n't mind being poor , but we are poor , you know  --  we must be awfully careful ! " " Sure ! Just this one dinner at Ben Riley 's , and afterward we 'll watch every penny . " She looked down at her dress . " I ought to go upstairs and change . " He saw a chance to score . " Who 's talking of the simple life now ? Come as you are ! You look all right for the subway . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes , his dark baggy trousers , IO2 BACHELOR-OF ARTSa gray coat and vest , a soft shirt . No sweater tonight , but otherwise a decided note of comfort and relaxation . " If it 's a smart place , " Mimi worried , " with dancing , they 'll wear dinner coats . " " This child will not , " said he . " Come on , clean up your desk there , and we 'll be off . " In the subway they would have talked , if the noise had not been too great , but Mimi spoke to him with tender glances , which he would have acknowledgedif there had n't been so many people in the car . He thought it best to stare at the advertisementsup behind the straps , and once he whistled . At Van Cortland Park there was a taxi waiting , as Jim had prophesied , and they began climbing the hill , along the boulevard , and then with a turn to the left they emerged in the parking place in front of Ben Riley 's . Alec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could assume . The size of Ben Riley 's made him nervous . Outside there were dozens of cars . " Shall I wait , sir ? " asked the driver . " Wait ? We 'll be here all night ! " " I 'll come back for you , " said the man . " Do n't bother . We 'll form our plans as we go along . " Mimi pinched his arm . " Tell him to come for us at eleven ! " ALEC HAS A CAR I03He led her up the steps . " I do n't get engaged every day . " Surrendering his hat to the girl at the check room , he ran his hand over his close-cropped hair , to be sure he was ready to face the diners . It proved an ordeal . The whole city seemed to be there , and they were in evening clothes , and they all stopped to look at Alec and Mimi as the waiter led them to a conspicuous table . Alec thought the waiter 's manneroffensively superior . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfolding his napkin . " Now we can enjoy ourselves ! What 'll you have ? How about a filet mignon ? " " The soup is excellent tonight , " reminded the waiter , pad in hand . " Oh , yes  --  soup ! Have some soup , Mimi ? " The waiter kept right after him . " Would you care for some oysters , sir ? " " Why not ? " Alec put down the card and leaned back , glad that the worst was over . " Oysters , tomatosoup , filet mignon . For two , " he added , to let Mimi in . The waiter thanked him , removed the menus , and retired . Alec cast a courageous eye around the room . Mimi whispered across the table . " Alec dear , did you see how much filet mignon costs ? I 'd be just as happy with something else ! " I04 BACHELOR-OF ARTSAlec did not hear her . He was staring at a distant object . On his face was unmistakable anger. , " I 'll be darned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing a dinner coat ! " Mimi followed the direction of his wrath . Sure enough , the budding law student was entertaining a blonde at a table on the other side of the dancing space . " Would n't you think he 'd have told me they dress here ? " complained Alec . " And I 'd just paid him every cent I owed , ! That 's what he 's dining on ! " Mimi tried a soft answer . " You look more distinguished , no matter how you 're dressed . Besides , he knows you have a dinner coat . Perhaps he thought you 'd resent being told to wear it . " The head waiter interrupted . " Beg pardon ; sir , is your chauffeur dining here too ? " " My what ? " Mimi explained . " He thinks you brought your car . " " Oh , I see . No , I came in a taxi . " The head waiter bowed his thanks and disappeared . Alec wiped his brow . " I do n't half like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dinner coat they thought you might have a chauffeur . The best people sometimes dress queerly . " " He 's coming over ! " exclaimed Alec . " I like his nerve ! " ALEC HAS A CAR I05Jim had left his blonde for a moment , to greet them in innocent friendship . " Glad you found the place ! It 's all right , is n't it ! " Mimi smiled up at him . Alec resolutely kept his seat . " Gladys is with me , " added Jim . " My God ! " exclaimed Alec . " Is that who it is ? " Mimi changed the subject . " It looks like a beautifulfloor . " " Are you telling me ? " inquired Jim . " I 'll show you when the music starts . Alec can dance with Gladys . " Mimi laughed , and Jim went back to his lady . " Damn condescending , I 'll say ! " growled Alec . " You 're sensitive tonight , " remarked Mimi . " Isit because we are engaged ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to myself . " " It is n't that , " explained Alec . " Oh , " said Mimi , disappointed . " I hoped it was . " " No , it 's his manner . He 's always high hat when he has his glad rags on . " The oysters arrived just as the band tuned . She smiled at him . " Our first dance  --  since you really proposed ! " They danced well together , as young things can who have done it often , and tonight her joy in him was graceful to watch . The diners watched . Alec misinterpreted their interest , and was glad when the music stopped . The other dancers applaudedIo6 BACHELOR  --  OF ARTSfor an encore , but he reminded her the oysters were waiting . They ate their oysters . " This is wonderful food , " said Mimi happily . " I 'll never eat clams again without thinking of you and me . " When the music resumed , she wanted to dance again , but she thought he ought to suggest it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their soup . But there was nothing on the table the next time the band struck up , and reading her thoughts , he resigned himself . " Do you feel like waltzing ? " Their evolutions brought them , in spite of his care , shoulder to shoulder with Jim and Gladys . " Here , " said Jim cheerfully , " is where we change partners ! " Alec found himself with Gladys in his arms . Not that she wished to be there . Alec supposed he ought to talk to her . " How 's Extension getting on ? " " Say , you 're as rude as before ! " " Rude nothing  --  I was just asking . " " Jim says they 've taken you into the house . " " Yes . " " Well , they were awfully short of members ! " After that he did n't try to talk . Extension riffraff ! He gave her back to Jim , and recovered Mimi . They ate their filet mignon . " I know a night club where we could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A CAR I07tasse to finish off with , and then go downtown ? " " Why , this is perfect , Alec ! And you must n't spend any more . " " It 's too crowded , " he insisted , beckoning the waiter . In ten minutes they were on the steps of the parking place , looking in vain for a taxi . Any number of chauffeurs were standing around , with curious eyes , but no taxi . " You ought to have told him to come back . " " Let 's walk , " said he desperately . " It 's only a step . " " It 's a mile ! " " Well , it 's down hill . " In the subway he began to feel better , and in spite of the noise , he was moved to conversation . " When you go to a place like that , " he yelled in her ear , " you should have your own car . " " A taxi would have done , " she called back . " If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the car would be cheaper . " " But we sha n't go three times a week . " " Who said we would ? I meant , in case we did ! " At the University station they got off , and she saw he had forgotten about the night club . They walked to her door , on the corner of 114th Street . She wondered whether he had also forgotten about their engagement . " I 've had a lovely evening , Alec  --  thanks ever so1o8 BACHELOR  --  OF ARTSmuch ! And by the way , do you still wish to marry me ? You do n't have to  --  I just want to know where we stand . " He was hurt . " Have n't I been celebrating our wedding all evening ? The first thing after breakfastI 'll get a license . " " Alec  --  do n't get mad  --  but Jim says you 're not old enough . " " He does , does he ! Stabbing me behind my back ! Why did n't he say that to me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nineteen . I 'll find out how it 's done , and I 'll come to the store early . I 'm going to cut classes tomorrow . " In the morning she was busy at her work , but thinking of him . He did not come early . She feared he had met some difficulty with the law . No doubt Jim was right . It was too much to hope that their happiness was as near as Alec believed . Well , they could wait , if they must , for another year and a half , and perhaps that would be for the best , if she could look at it unselfishly . He really ought to get more education . Even to her love , at times he seemed young . At a quarter to twelve he came into the drugstore , but not through the front door , and not with his usual abundance of spirits . He slipped in from the side street , and she knew at once that he was weighed down with thought . She felt sorry forALEC HAS A CAR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . " What luck ? " He leaned on the side of the desk . " What would you say to my buying a car ? " " I 'd say you could n't ! " " Well , listen to this ! After I left you last night , I dropped in at the house , and Tom told me of a man who had to raise some cash in a hurry . It 's the smartest roadster you ever saw , yellow , with an extra lot of nickel on it . Only used two years , and he 'd sell it for four hundred and fifty dollars . That leaves me nearly one hundred and fifty dollars for garage , gas and upkeep . What d' you say ? " She felt cold all over , and some of the chill got into her voice . " If you think you can afford it , it sounds like a bargain . Of course you 'd have someonelook at it first , so you would n't be cheated . " He stared at her . " So far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it myself . Come out and I 'll show it to you . " He beckoned toward the side door . " Alec , do n't tell me you 've bought it ! " " Sure I have ! I could n't let a bargain like that get away ! What 's the matter with you ? You are n't crying , are you ? " " Alec dear ! Yesterday you were going to use that money to get married ! I thought youIIO BACHELOR-OF ARTSwanted me , but you 've bought a car instead ! " It surprised him that she could doubt his passion . " The moment I saw the machine , " he explained , " I thought how hard on you it must be to pinch along and never go anywhere . Last night it was darn embarrassing at Ben Riley 's without a car . Now we can ride every day , and really see something of each other , and I 'll be in better shape to work , and  --  I do n't see what you 're so grouchy about ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I do n't care to see your car ! You were n't serious ! Please do n't come here any more ! " He was crushed . " Gosh , I 'm sorry you take it that way ! I thought you 'd be glad ! " " Then why did n't you come in the front door like a man ? Why did you hide it around on the side street ? You 're a spoiled child , and you knew you ought to be ashamed of yourself ! " She spoke distinctly , and the clerks in the store might be listening . " All right , " he conceded . " I 'm sorry , if that 's what you want me to say . But what can I do with the thing , now I 've got it ? " " Ride around in it , Baby ! Only do n't come here ! " His world wobbled beneath his unhappy feet . He got to the side door , and paused to contemplate his luckless purchase , from which the glamour had already departed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ALEC HAS A CAR IIIa vivid yellow , with even more nickel on it than he had described . In the noonday sun it was rather blinding . At the wheel sat a small blonde , wrapped in a sport coat , with a beret plastered on one side of her head , like a pancake . His coming made her look toward the door . Gladys ! She was startled when he appeared , but quickly recovered her natural relation to the universe . " Hello , neighbor ! " she called . " Is n't this a cute trick ! I 'm waiting to see what goes with it . " At a loss for words , he went around the car and stood beside her , digging in his pocket for the key . Her jaw dropped . " Do n't tell me it 's yours ! " Her confusion was a great comfort to him , at that moment . " Move over , will you ? " he suggested politely . " Are you going anywhere ?

Albert had just returned from an embassyto the Dean . Now he stretched his long legsII2 BACHELOR-OF ARTSacross Tom 's room , took off his spectacles , cleaned them , held them up to the light . " Come on , spill it ! " said Tom . " Will he do any-thing ? " Albert put his spectacles in place . " He wo n't . " " He 's crazy ! " exclaimed Tom . " It 's his job ! " " Well , he ca n't see it .

I did n't say that Jim brought them together . " " I did ? " protested Jim . " It was Tom first . She 's a regular hell-cat , and you have to know how to handle her . " " Get to the point ! " Tom broke in . " What did the Dean say ? " " He listened , nodding his head , then he decided it was none 3f his business .

" It 's rough on her ! " Jim shifted one leg over the other . " I do n't know  --  she has her feet on the ground . I stopped at the store yesterday . If she 's grieving , she does n't let on .

" " Just on time . " " Well , how about a spin ? I want to stop at my house a second . Do you mind ? " Along Amsterdam there was little talk , Gladys being uncertain as to road rules and a bit arbitrary with the gears . As she had said , they were not silent . At I18th she turned to the right , and came to a pause between two no-parking signs . " Just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrant , " protested Mimi . " Just a second . " " Leave your license , in case the police arrest me ! " " Have n't any . Do n't worry . " She disappeared into the apartment house . Mimi leaned over the side of the car . The fender was resting on the hydrant . She studied the dash-board . There was plenty of gas . The speedometer registeredsixty-one thousand miles . Some of that , of course , during the previous ownership . From the switch the key was dangling . For the moment there was no one on the sidewalk . She drew the key from the switch , put it inher pocketbook , got out , and walked briskly home . Two days later Alec came sheepishly into theALEC HAS A CAR I17store , just as she finished her work . When she saw him , she could n't be angry . " Why , hello , stranger ! " " I 've been working a lot , " he explained promptly . " Never did so much work in my life . Say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got five dollars . " She asked no questions , but went . On the way he began to unfold . " It 's a funny thing , the police found that car of mine in front of a hydrant . " " Do n't you know better than that ? " " I did n't leave it there ! They say no one was in it . " There was a pause . She waited discreetly . " They could n't start it , they had to haul it away , and there 's a charge for that . Twenty-five bucks . " " How awful , Alec ! " " And another twenty-five for leaving it there . And I did n't have a cent . " " What are you going to do ? " " Oh , it 's all right now . I sold the car to a fellow in Alpha Delt for fifty-five . That 's where I got the five . " They maintained a brief silence . " You 'll miss your car , wo n't you ? " " Not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another silence . " How is Gladys ? " " Do n't know , and I do n't care ! " I18 BACHELOR-OF ARTS " Why , I thought you liked her ! " " Oh , yeah ? " Silence again . " Gosh , Mimi , that 's a swell dress you have on ! " " Silly ! It 's the same old one ! " " Is it ? I thought it was new ! It looks swell ! " Just then a man passed , and bowed to Mimi . Alec pulled his hat off . A tall , gaunt man . Mimi called out , " Why , hello ! " as though the man and she were pretty thick . Alec looked at the man again . ProfessorWoolsey ! " Has that fellow been around much , Mimi ? " " Every day . " Alec Faces His RivalTHE glimpse of the cordial friendship on Mimi 's face as she acknowledged Professor Woolsey 's salute made Alec thoughtful . When they reached Childs he was grumpy . He spoke only if Mimi asked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mischievoussmile . She was teasing him . At the restaurant he ordered their meal ferociously , assertively , hardly consulting her taste . When the waiter had gone for the food , he sank in his chair with his legs stretched out and his hands in his pockets . Mimi leaned across the table . " Are n't you the silly boy ! " " I 'm not . " " Alec , you 're jealous ! You 're awfully funny ! " He sat up , and put his elbows on the table . " You like him , do n't you ? " " Very much . He 's a wonderful man . " " Well , he 's a professor , and I suppose he has a good line of talk with women . Looks pretty conceitedto me. " n9I20 BACHELOR-OF ARTSShe laughed . " He 's one of the finest men I ever met . " Jealousy made him mean . " As though you had met so many ! You 're not so old yourself . " Her blue eyes flashed . " That 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ever met , but I do n't love him ! You 're not the finest man I ever met , but I do love you ! For my own sake I hope you 're going to improve . When you go jealous , you just make me mad . " He hid behind his food , glad of an excuse not to have to answer her at once . What she said went deep . " I do n't pretend to be the finest man you ever met  --  but just what does this mean ? " She was still indignant . " I thought you were very manly , very strong , very decisive . I must have fallen in love with you because of your firm , way that night , when you wanted me all to yourself , and would n't let Tom cut in . If you could be that sort of person once , you could be it always . But now you 're rather wobbly , are n't you ? " " Mimi ! You know I want to marry you ! " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorts of things , you scatter yourself . Alec , I do n't believe you know what you really want ! You 're not heading anywhere in particular . That 's why you 're jealous of Professor Woolsey  --  you would be of any man who has found his work and is going straight . " ALEC FACES HIS RIVAL I2INeither he nor she at their age could realize how demoralising it is to be a freshman  --  to be putting on a man 's ways with childhood still clinging to you . He knew what she said was true , or at least he felt enough truth in it to be a little contrite . " I 'll do anything you wish . " " Oh , I 'm not giving orders . Work it out yourself . I made my decision when I took a job in the drugstore . " " Well , did n't I want to get a job too ? And did n't you tell me not to ? " It bored her a little , to have this argument return . Your father is giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that away . " You mean you want me to be a good student ? " " Why not ? It is n't a disgrace , is it ? " Rather a sad meal on the whole . They agonized over Alec 's faults , and irritated each other , and were sorry and made up , and then did it all over again . Mimi declined to see a picture at the Nemo afterwards . She was tired , she explained  --  she would go to her hall bedroom and get some sleep . When they said good-bye at the elevator door , she dealt him a particularly effective blow . " If I were a man , and anything worried or frightened me , I 'd face it quickly . I 'm sure if you do n't face it quickly , you 'll get into the habit of not facing it at all . " Through the night Alec woke from time to time , I22 BACHELOR-OF ARTSas though some neighboring sound had roused him , but the dormitory was no noisier than usual , and it was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there and wonder if he was afraid of anything , and try to decide what it was , and the more he questioned himself , the more morbid he became , until the tired thoughts refused to come , and he fell into a half slumber , only to wake later and go on with his questioning . What should bother him  --  except the fact that he could n't marry Mimi ? And the fact that that fellow Woolsey kept appearing from time to time ! Woolsey was nothing to be afraid of , of course , but he certainly was a nuisance . Mimi did n't understand what it meant for a man like Alec to be in love . No inexperienced woman could understand . He had heard fellows say that , and of course it was true . Nature made women that way . They just have to wait till a man loves them , and then they get into the habit of being loved , and of course like it . But with a man like Alec it was altogether different . Nature intended him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell not to be able to marry when you want to . When he danced with Mimi  --  well , it was just hell the way he felt . When they kissed each other , she certainly was cordial about it and all that , but it did n't mean anything deep to her  --  that is , not yet . You could tell by the way she could turnALEC FACES HIS RIVAL I23around and do something else , something quite different , even frivolous . He remembered one dance at the house when they had had a moment unobservedin the library and he had kissed her till his head reeled , and then they heard someone coming , and a fellow cut in , and in a moment there she was over at the punch bowl with the interloper , drinking lemonade . Women are casual like that , before they know what life is . Was he really afraid of Woolsey ? She said she admired the prof but did n't love him . Could it be possible that Woolsey had any charm ? Alec was certain he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wished he knew just how dangerous Woolsey was . He wished he could talk with the fellow . Gosh ! Why not ? If he went up to Woolsey 's office and had it out with him , Woolsey could n't do anything , could he ? On this brave question Alec fell into his last sleep for the night , and woke next morning weary and befogged , but after a good shower and a carefulshave , he began to see a clear path ahead . That was a swell idea . He would go up and talk to Woolsey . First , of course , he would have his breakfast , but right after breakfast , Woolsey  --  unless the slob was giving a class . Had he followed all his impulses , he would have sought his breakfast in the grill downstairs , so that he might for the time being avoid further conversaI24 BACHELOR-OFARTStion with Mimi . He was conscious of a wish , a strange wish , to avoid her . Last night she had made him feel guilty . He would have preferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reestablished his self-respect . It would have been satisfactory first to investigate Woolsey , and be sure that Mimi overrated him , and then drop in and tell her so . But this impulse he resisted , since it might be cowardly . He ought to face embarrassment . At the drugstore she was so glad to see him that he almost gave up his plan to see Woolsey . The emergencies of life disappeared when Mimi smiled at him that way . Of course he did n't tell her of the unhappy thoughts that had pursued him through the night . He had his coffee and toast and his orange juice , and he mentioned a dance at the fraternity , and from time to time he imparted the information that he loved her . When he left the drugstore she asked as usual what his day was to be , and he said he was going to his class . But first , in spite of his comforting interlude , he knew he ought to reach the top floor of Hamilton and knock at Woolsey 's door . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for four people if they hold their breath , was vaguely sliding up and down somewhere beyond call . Alec did not wait for it . When he reached the top floor he was panting . ALEC FACES HIS RIVAL I25 " Come in ! " He opened Woolsey 's door . The rangy , slightly gaunt figure was slouched in a chair by the desk . " Well ? " Woolsey was looking at him pleasantly enough , but with a slight challenge in his eyes , or so Alec thought . Of course he had reason not to like Woolsey , but why should Woolsey be on guard against him ? " I beg your pardon , Professor . My name 's Hamilton . " Woolsey smiled . Your apology 's accepted . " " I mean , I 'm not in your classes , but I thought I might ask your advice . " Woolsey motioned to a chair , a plain , kitchen chair , not comfortable . " What 's your problem ? " " I 'm not getting on very well here . " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir . " " But not well enough , eh ? I doubt if I can help you , Hamilton  --  it 's up to you . " Not entirely , sir , " Alec objected . " I 'm willing to study if I know what it 's about , but these courses mix you up if you put your mind on them . " Woolsey frowned . He was old enough to have heard this from several generations of freshmen . He wished youth were n't so conventional . Someoneought to invent a new complaint . " What courses are you taking ? " I26 BACHELOR-OF ARTS " English and math " Let 's stop there . ' What 's the matter with them ? " They do n't get anywhere , sir . I 've had a lot of English . But that 's all right  --  I 'm used to it . I can write five hundred words an hour  --  that comes to only eight and a third words a minute . That ought to satisfy the Department , if you can believe what they say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's all right , too . I 've always flunked math . I 'm taking a lot of history  --  AmericanNot in freshman year , " contradicted Woolsey . " There 's a prerequisite for American History . " " I know , sir  --  I should have Contemporary Civilizationfirst , but I wanted American History , and nobody noticed the mistake till the Dean sent for me , and then it was the only course I was passing , so he let me stay . I wish I had more of it , instead of this stuff in Contemporary Civilization . " " Stuff , eh ? " " Beg pardon . I suppose it 's all right , but I thought from the name it would be contemporary , and now they say we ca n't appreciate the present unless we take a glimpse at the past . This week we 're just leaving ancient Egypt , on the way up to Greece . " As he spoke his voice faltered . When he had resolved to face Woolsey , he had forgotten that he must bring some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't set in order the items of his errand , and he really had no errand , except that he wished to look Woolsey over . A powerful brute , to tell the truth , awfully steady eyes , and quite a chin . Alec wondered why the fellows were supposed to adore the man . He was n't the sort you could fool easily ; that is , he did n't look like a professor at all . " Physical ed. is pretty bad , sir . I mean that weekly lecture . The smut course . The prof pretendshe does n't know what we know , and he dare n't answer the questions we 'd like to ask . " Woolsey kept boring at him with his steady gaze . " I thought  --  well , I thought you might give me some advice . " Woolsey sat up a little straighter in his chair , and leaned forward . " You have other teachers . Why did you come to me ? " " The fellows speak of you , sir . I  --  I wanted to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought  --  you 'd be the one who could help . " " Have you talked to the Dean about this ? " " He blows me up for not working . " " So you admit you have n't been working ! Wastingyour time , eh ? " Alec was disgusted with himself for feeling embarrassed . He had intended this to be a man to man encounter , but Woolsey was treating him as though he were no better than a freshman . I28 BACHELOR-OF ARTS " I 've had my mind on other things , sir . This first year has been rather hectic , but I wonder if I 'm headed the right way , even if I worked . " Woolsey narrowed his eyes a little . " Will you tell me some of the things that interfere with your studies ? Are you trying to get acquainted with the town ? " Alec noted that Woolsey would n't have said that to a boy who had grown up in New York . How did he know Alec was from Trenton ? " The usual obstacles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fraternity , cards , and girls . Some of those who dread study avoid the danger by getting drunk . You do n't look like that type . " " Not girls , sir . I know one fine one  --  and there 's another , but I do n't like her . She does n't count . The fraternity is rather a help , would n't you say ? " " Miss Stoltz is a fine girl . " Alec had to recall who Miss Stoltz was . He had dreamed of her only as Mimi . " How 'd you know ? " " She has mentioned you . She worries about what you are doing  --  or are n't doing . May I ask , did she send you to me ? " Alec had never in his life felt so mortified . " She does n't know I 'm here . I do n't think it was quite right for her to discuss my affairs with a stranger ! " " Do n't take it wrong , " said Woolsey . " You would n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HIS RIVAL I29She admires  --  what you could be . She 's afraid you are loafing on your job . As a matter of fact , I asked the Dean what you were doing , and his impression coincides with hers . He likes you too . He and Miss Stoltz will both be sorry if you flunk out , and neither of them thinks it 's necessary . " " I appreciate their interest , " said Alec in a des- perate attempt to be dignified . " Look here , Hamilton , " said Woolsey , in a sharper tone , " if you really want my advice , do n't be a young fool ! You 're not the first by any means ! Everything you 've had so far has been handed to you on a platter . Do n't wait around for someone to serve up the rest of life the same way ! Get out and work ! You have no problems . I told Miss Stoltz not to worry about you . In your pres- ent state of mind , as the Dean described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at anything like its proper worth ! " Alec stood up , but not to go . He wanted to talk on his feet . " Professor Woolsey , you do n't understand my case at all ! That 's the way college is . The profes- sors do n't understand ! What business is it of yours to tell her I would n't value her attention ? She knows darn well how much I think of her . " " How have you showed it ? " Alec got back his temper . " I asked you for help about my course . I ca n't discuss my private affairs. 130 BACHELOR-OF ARTSThe fact is , I love her . She knows darn well I do ! I 'm disappointed in her . She should n't have discussedme with you . " Woolsey took out his cigarette case and offered it . " Sit down . Have one ? " " No , thanks . " Woolsey lighted his cigarette , and took his time about it . " I 'm glad you dropped in . I 'm glad you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I 'll tell you something in return . I love her too . " Alec tried to realize what he was hearing . Woolseyrose to his feet and faced him , quite at ease , cigarette in hand . " I understand that you love her , or you think you do . From my point of view you 're rather young , not yet formed  --  in fact , Hamilton , I consideryou quite a cub , and she 's a remarkable woman . I love her myself , do you understand ? I asked her to marry me . " Alec 's knees weakened under him . " Is she going to ? " " She says not . She turned me down . She loves you . It was only because she loves you that she worried over your loafing . " Too bewildered to make a sensible answer , Alec struck out impulsively . " If a man really loved a woman , he 'd go out after her and get her ! " " That 's one method , " said Woolsey . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may get her yet  --  after you convinceher that she thinks too highly of you . " Alec walked over to the window and looked down at the lower floors of Kent Hall across the street . He could see people moving about in the rooms . They seemed strangely casual and placid , unaware of the tremendous words , the deep passions , which were enclosed for the moment in this plain office of Professor Woolsey 's . How much could happen within bare walls , with just a bookcase and a filing cabinet and two chairs and a desk ! He turned and faced the gaunt man . " She does n't think too highly of me , sir . I 'll prove to her she does n't ! " " All right . Prove it ! " Alec started toward the door . " I ought not to have come to you for help . " " Why not ? " " Well , if we both want her Woolsey smiled . " I 've given you your chance , Hamilton , but it 's not out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a great man , from which I conclude that she 's very badly smitten . But if you get on the job now , push ahead with your work , and make a success of your life , then she 's right , and you win . I 'm in something of a jam . You asked my help , and being a teacher I have a silly notion I ought to give it  --  so I 've given it . Naturally , if you insist on being a complete ass , 132 BACHELOR-OF ARTSand flunk out of college , I may perhaps console myself . " For Alec this talk was getting to be too much . " Good-bye . " He stuck out a nervous hand . Woolsey took it in a firm grasp . " Drop in any time , if you like . " Alec took himself in a daze to his section of Contemporary Civilization , and being five minutes late , annoyed the young instructor who was just launched on a demonstration of the debt of ancient Greece to still more ancient Egypt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a seat in the back of the room . This sitting behind the class was getting to be a habit ! That dark-skinned fellowwas among the W 's again . He smiled at Alec . Darn his impudence ! The lecture on Greek geography did not penetrate his consciousness . He realized once more how monotonous can be the professorial groan , and from his position in the room behind the last lettersof the alphabet he had an unusually good view of the resources of his fellows against insidious ennui . When he sat where he belonged , among the H 's , he missed a lot , since the front letters were under the teacher 's eye , but in the last rows the fellows drew pictures in their notebooks , or read novels behind broad backs , or in one instance , carried on a friendly game of chess with a pocket board . ALEC FACES HIS RIVAL 133Alec felt himself an outsider , not of this scene . None of these , neither the students nor the soporific instructor , had ever had his newly acquired but intimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one of them had ever fallen deeply in love and had faced a plain-speaking , hard-hitting , rival like Woolsey . He must do his work , must he ? Gosh ! This was the work they expected him to do ! In order to prove himself worthy to marry her , and bring up children , and all the rest of it  --  he must memorize this drivel about the sea-levels and rocks and rivers , and hand it back to that pasty-faced instructorat the end of the term , in one of those cheap , sad books , pink or blue . Gosh ! In his thoughts he no longer referred to Woolsey as a slob . He did n't like Woolsey , now that he had met him , but at least he was n't a slob . It must have been very embarrassing for Woolsey to have him call . No one would enjoy entertaining the rival whom the woman preferred . Alec tried to make himself feel that any roughness in Woolsey 's words should be excused on the grounds of defeat and chagrin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been rough . He had been rather big . If he himselfwere as big , perhaps he ought to ask whether Woolsey were n't the right man for Mimi . But that would be foolish , of course . Mimi had lots of sense . She would know enough to love the right134 BACHELOR-OF ARTSman . All he had to do now was to get up these courses , and have a row of A 's at the end of the term , and then earn some money , and marry her . He 'd show Woolsey ! He knew he 'd feel better if he could tell Mimi what had happened , but it would n't be delicate . This was between Woolsey and him . He wondered if Woolsey would tell her . That would be pretty yellow ! He did n't believe Woolsey was yellow . As he left Hamilton Hall at the end of the hour , Tom was coming around the corner of the buildingfrom a class in Fayerweather , and they went for lunch together in the grill . He could see Mimi at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled . For the present it would be easier to consortwith Tom , even though the grill was crowded , and the smell of cooking discouraged appetite . You ate your food off oak tables , in true tavern style , and the table-tops were washed , from time . to time , but students did it , those fellows who were earning their way , and of course they were in a hurry , poor devils ! Alec took the knife and scratched off a bit of hardened egg , where some patron had breakfasted inaccurately . There was also a vestige of previous meals between the prongs of Alec 's fork . After whittling it clean , he wiped knife and fork on his napkin . " I 've just had a rotten letter from home , " saidALEC FACES HIS RIVAL 135Tom . " Your father went to college , did n't he ? " " Sure . 1909 . " " I wish mine had ! He does n't know what it 's about . I like the old scout , but he tells me what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polite to him , of course . " Tom mentioned the compulsory politeness as though it were the ultimate injustice . Alec felt at that moment that the troubles of another were not important , and he was sorry that trivial mattersshould divert his own mood . He had never asked Tom about his people . " What does your father do ? " " He keeps a store up in Binghamton . Good business , and all that , but it 's a dead place . Know it ? " " Sure , by name . " " That 's the best way . No one ever stops there . Sometimes they go through . " Alec would have let the deficiencies of Binghamtontake care of themselves , but Tom was looking for sympathy . " My folks are awfully narrow  --  you know , too good . They 're fond of me and all that , but they want me to be a saint . I took Gladys out one night last week , and a Binghamton man saw us go into the hotel , and he told Father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 136 BACHELOR-OF ARTS " You took Gladys to a hotel ? " " Sure . " It was Alec 's first realization of a morality which goes deeper than the law . Hundreds of times he had known of youthful collisions between the sexes  --  his home town had its share of human nature  --  butnever before had he felt shocked . He liked Tom , and Tom and Gladys did not belong together . " You do n't love her , do you ? " " God , no ! " " Why did you do it ? " " Do n't be silly ! Why did I ? Do n't you ever ? " " Not yet . " He felt somewhat ashamed to admit his virtue . Tom stared at him . " I thought you loved Mimi . " " That 's it  --  I love her . " " You do n't mean to say it 's platonic ! Well , no accounting for taste . " Their talk lagged for a moment . Alec was wondering why his love was platonic , as Tom called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sissy , yet he felt he was right . " Anyway , " he said suddenly , " it did n't have to be Gladys . " Tom looked up , ready to defend himself , but none too happy . " You know what a pest she is . She just keptALEC FACES HIS RIVAL 137after me , and  --  oh , well , I suppose I wanted her for the moment . " Again they were silent . Tom started to justify himself . " The way things are nowadays , we 'll be thirtyfiveor forty before we can marry . What are we going to do meanwhile ? Dad preaches at me , but he 's all right . He 's got a wife . The same way with all these profs . You notice ? A prof has to have a woman even if he starves . Jove ! They do starve , too ! You know Barth , in history , with the Adam 's apple ? " Alec had n't noticed signs of hunger in his teachers , but then he had n't studied his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English instructor , Billy Bridge , was pretty thin , yet he might be a bachelor . Woolsey was thin . " I had a swell plan for this summer , " Tom went on . " I heard of a job on a ranch  --  not much pay , but plenty of exercise . Now the old man wo n't trust me out of his sight . It 's Binghamton for me . " " Going to work in the store ? " " Had n't thought of it . I 'll just sit around and mope , and give a report of myself when the old man comes homes at night . Hell ! " " I thought , " said Alec , " maybe you were trying to earn some money . " He went back to his own plans . " Maybe that ranch would be good for me. " 138 BACHELOR-OF ARTSSlowly an idea made its way through Tom 's sorrows . " Why do n't you come to Binghamton , and brighten up the jail ? When I tell the folks that you 're the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then you can stand up for me a little . What say ? " He was trying to be facetious , but he still looked a bit wretched . He repeated the invitation . " Why do n't you , Alec ? " " I 'd like to , all right . " " 0 . K. , we 'll fix it . " They finished their coffee , and Tom went back to the laboratory , where he was accumulating some laboriously inaccurate statistics about sound waves , His notebook was sadly in arrears . The sound machine was a tube into which you introduced water to raise the pitch . Or if you preferred , you could turn on the faucet so hard that the tube became a fountain , and soaked the unfortunates who were working near you . The most startling of Tom 's experiments so far had been thought up impromptu , when the laboratory instructor had stepped out for a moment . Alec went upstairs to his room in the dormitory , and sat down with his feet on the bed , to straighten out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this other talk with Tom , all in one morning ! He and Woolsey leading the noble life , and poorALEC FACES HIS RIVAL 139Tom grubbing along like an animal ! Of course the fellows would say that Tom was practical , and Woolsey was just a professor . There was n't so much satisfaction in living well if professors did it too . Alec hated to be like a professor . The works of art hung above his bed , the naked ladies who had supplanted the portraits of his sisters , annoyed him for a reason which he could not name . He wanted to put them out of sight . For the moment they hurt him . Woolsey probably had no such ornaments in his room . Well , he would leave them up . He did n't care to model himself upon Woolsey . He went out for a bit of air , just a stroll toward the Library , perhaps even as far as the gym . Somethinginteresting might be going on there . But as he crossed the street he ran into Gladys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a moment sooner , he might have avoided the meeting . " Caught at last ! " she called cheerfully . " Where have you been keeping yourself ? " He wanted to run away . She looked rather pretty , all dressed up , with a lot of paint on . He thought of her and Tom , and looked her over with a new interest , and felt a little sick . " I wanted to explain about your car . " " Do n't bother . " He tried to move off , but she kept step with him. 140 BACHELOR-OF ARTS " It really was n't my fault . I left it just for a moment . " " Oh , that 's all right . I 've sold it , anyway . " " But the cop took it away , did n't he ? It wasn'tmy fault . I just went up to my room for a moment , and when I came down Mimi was gone . " She had his attention now . " That girl 's an awful cheap-skate ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , am I ? Say , you leave her alone ! " " Ai n't I your friend , Alec ? Well , I am ! I'mwarning you . I would n't have taken her for a rideif I had n't known how much you liked her . " She enjoyed his surprise . " Did n't tell you she was riding with me , did she ? Well , she was ! She pretended we were as thick as two peas , both of us riding in your car . I left her just for a moment , to get a warmer coat , and when I came down , she had gone and taken the key out of the thing , so I could n't start it . I was still trying when the cop came around the corner . I felt awfully bad , watching from my window , when they sent the wrecker to take it away . It was a dirty trick she played on you , Alec ! " " Think so ? " " Do n't you ? " " I think you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't believe a word of that story !

" When he called her a liar , he expected to be through with her , once for all . Had she slapped his face , he would not have been surprised . But she put on her most charming smile  --  she had never made herself quite so alluring  --  and there on the sidewalk she stood so close that she almost leaned against him , and took hold of the lapels of his collar as though to draw down his head toward hers . " You 're an awfully nice kid , but you 're a kid ! I never met anything so young . You expected her to tell you all about it , did you ? You do n't know two females are fighting over you ? " " Who ? " asked Alec . Gladys laughed . " She and I. She thought she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little gogettertechnique , she sailed right in and got your car arrested . She thinks she settled me , once for all ! She can just wait and see ! " Alec ought to have been indifferent to the news that Gladys was waging a battle for his favor , but he was n't indifferent ; he was vaguely pleased . In spite of himself he thought better of the girl . When she spoke against Mimi , he knew she was a liar , but when she confessed an interest in him , he thought he discerned truth . His manner became smoother , though no less firm . " Awfully nice of you to pull my leg , but she142 BACHELOR-OF ARTSdid n't go riding with you . I do n't care , anyway . I got the car back , and it 's sold , and that 's that . " Gladys stood away from him , and if he had not been , as she said , so young , he might have recognized a world-old menace in her steady eye . " I 'd rather not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary ! We 'll just go together to the drugstore where that red-headed cashier hangs out , and I 'll drag the truth out of her , in your presence ! " " Good-bye , " he said . " I 've some work to do . " " So have I. " " Aw , cut it out , Gladys ! Anything that Mimi does or says is all right with me . That yarn of yours is made up , but I do n't hold it against you . Forget it ! " " You 're afraid to ask her ! You 're afraid it 's true ! " He had had enough . " If I want to ask her , I will . Otherwise , I wo n't . That 's my business . " Then , it must be confessed , he ran away . He moved toward the Library steps so fast that to keep up with him she would have had to run . He almost expected her to make the effort and overtake him . But she walked on toward Amsterdam . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ground floor , came out to Broadway , past Earl Hall , down to 114th Street , and east toward the drugstore . He saw before him one more heavy interview that day . Honor Thy FatherIF Tom had not insisted , Alec would never have paid that visit to Binghamton at the end of freshman year . When the invitation was given , it had seemed casual , and the intervening months suggested other plans . But Tom must have the visit out of him , and considered it a promise . What made it easier after all for Alec to leave his family was a sudden and unexplained streak of economy in his father . The Hamiltons usually spent their summers in Maine , but this year Mr. Hamilton kept them in Trenton , which could mean only that his mind was failing . Alec was sorry to observe in his parent such early symptoms of senility . There was practically nothing to do in Trenton in the summer  --  a little tennis , and movies , of course , and his sisters , and other nondescript @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a taste for that , but the materials for a good vacation were lacking . Alec knew nothing against Binghamton . Undoubtedly it would be better than Trenton . If in this season between the first and second college years he felt somewhat at loose ends , per-143144 BACHELOR-OF ARTShaps it was because Mimi had gone back to St. Louis . He missed her . Their parting had not been a happy one ; that is , she did n't make him feel certain she would come back in the fall , and he was n't sure that even if she did , she would offer him again that gorgeous friendship which seemed like love , only less embarrassing . He knew he had spoiled their relation when he went to her with that challenge about the ride with Gladys . He should have known enough not to mention Gladys . Mimi had admitted riding with the blonde , and removing the key from the car , she had practically boasted ; that she wanted to sink the bleached vamp , and he had made the error of disputing Mimi 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not that he really cared , but a man ought to stick for some independence . After that conversation the spring weeks dragged along . He saw Mimi every day , but the subject of marriage was not mentioned . He had reason enough to know he loved her , so lonely he felt each time they said good-bye , and so cheerful when they met again . Her face lighted when she saw him , he was glad to observe , and her blue eyes watched him with steady interest as he favored her with minute reports of his daily experiences . But he could n't help feeling that she was now quiet , cheerfullypatient , where at first she had been as enthusiasticas himself , about the world and their love . HONOR THY FATHER 145With spring upon him he felt the need of exercise , and under Tom 's urging he came out for football ; spring practice , Tom thought , would take any mind off female worries . The house had n't had a man on the team for years , and Tom held out hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would develop into a good end or something . Since the squad was small , as usual , the novice was n't much in the way , and the coaches let him go through the training with the others . Alec hoped it would impress Mimi , but if it did , she hid her feelings . She saved her applause for the day when he was able to tell her his marks had improved , and the Dean thought that with prayer and fasting he might continue his college course . The day she left for St. Louis , which to Alec seemed the other side of the globe , they had a partinglunch at Childs , and he took her to the train . It was just before Commencement , but he was n't staying for the ceremony . Mimi timed her own departureso that she could leave the day before he went back to Trenton . He did not notice this foresight of hers . " I ' 11 miss you , " he said across the table . She reached for his hand and gave it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . " You know , " he said , " I wish your father would get his money back , or something would happen so you would n't have to earn your living . " I46 BACHELOR-OF ARTSShe nodded . " I 'll go to college yet  --  you 'll see ! " He had n't thought of her going to college ; hercareer was to be his wife . But no doubt the collegewould let her study even though she was married . " When are you coming back ? " She did n't know . For the first time he caught the terrifying idea that she might not return at all . " I do n't blame you for not liking that drugstore job . You 've been plucky to last it out . " She assured him the year on the whole had been happy . " Mimi , you are coming back , are n't you ? " " What would you do if I did n't ? " " I 'd miss you like hell ! " " Well , would n't you come after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd come after you . " She showed no elation at his promise  --  in fact , she looked sad . " I want to tell you just one thing , Mimi  --  you 're the only one I love . I 'll write to you . " Will you ? " " You see if I do n't ! " She laughed . " Will it be once a month , or once a fortnight , or what ? " " Whatever you say . " She shook her head , serious again . " No , Alec , I 'm asking nothing . I 'm not even asking you to love me . I 'll never forget this year . Perhaps I got more out of it than you did . Maybe we'reHONOR THY FATHER 147going to love each other all our lives . Perhaps you 'll outgrow me and find some one you like better . I 'll wait and see . " He was strangely wounded by her lack of faith , and equally by her superior wisdom . She was talkingdown at him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course he expected her to swear fidelity , but she did n't . " I might outgrow even you , Alec . " He ought to have recognized the love under the teasing , but he flared up . " Oh , well , if that 's the way you feel about it ! " She squeezed his hand again , and held it for a long second , but nothing else was said about the durability of their passion . He felt there was much more to discuss , but she turned the talk to smaller things . At the station he put her on the train . She kissed him with a warmth which for the moment made him happy , but which afterwards left a sharp reaction . Did she mean it to be their farewell ? Brooding upon this doubt , he recognized the logic of it . He forced himself to review the year , and recalled one by one the too frequent days when he had been selfish . What a kid he had been ! Just a freshman ! If she had grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Home again in Trenton , he began a rapid cor-148 BACHELOR-OF ARTSrespondence , a letter to her every day for the first ten days , and then one every other day , as the strain told . At the end of the first week her answers began to come , affectionate but not so frequent . He drew a long sigh and slowed his pace to match hers . Her father was doing better ; she reported , and it was pleasant to see her people again . Her old schoolmates , she was careful to state , were makingup to her for the long application at her desk through the winter . She was going out almost every night and most of the afternoons . There 'd been one or two interesting parties in the morning . Her popularity would n't last , she admitted , but for the time being she had her hour . This well-planted barb went in , as she knew it would . He wrote at once , ahead of his schedule , to ask who were in these parties , and she promptly named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there were no boys along  --  he called them men . She answered , with the same promptness , that there were several , and all of them were dears . Laura and Beatrice Hamilton complained to their parents that brother was going mad , his treatment of them being incompatible with the hypothesis of sanity . At this news their father looked humiliated , but apparently not at the prospect of having a lunaticson . He was sorry they missed so much their summer in Maine , and his tone was apologetic . So when Tom wrote to come on out to BingHONORTHY FATHER 149hamton , Alec packed his bags , with his parents ' blessing and his sisters ' delighted aid . Binghamton proved not so far as he had expected , and not so bad as he had feared . A neat little city among the hills . Mr. Gustav Illings , Tom 's father , had a square stone and brick house on the edge of it , on the Susquehanna side . You could get into town by walking , or you could borrow the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be consulted . At breakfast daily the use of the car was allocated until midnight , when Tom ought to be in bed . The morning Alec arrived Tom had the use of the car as a special concession to the house guest . The traveler arriving from Trenton got the impression of carefree youth properly endowed with transportation . " Here at last ! " Tom called , wringing his hand and grabbing one of the bags . " We 'll throw these in the back seat and take a little spin till I catch up on the news . Had your breakfast ? " Tom drove fast , to cover the high spots of the city in an hour or so . He showed Alec where the Joshua Whitney house once stood , and tried to tell Alec who Joshua Whitney was , but he got him mixed with William Bingham for whom the town was named . He took Alec to the Recreation Park , and pointed out the memorials to the two Johnsons , but when Alec , out of politeness , asked which150 BACHELOR-OF ARTSJohnson was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found himself uninformed . To finish off , he showed Alec the State Hospital and the Masonic Temple , and the historic spot where the Chenango River runs into the Susquehanna . Alec was deeply impressed , as became a visitor just arrived . " The old man , " said Tom , " is still hot . He treats me like a jailbird out on parole . Mind you give me a good character , now ! " " What do you do with yourself ? " " Nothing much . He built a tennis court for me , and I know a fellow who can play pretty well , but his folks are taking him to Europe . Plenty of nice girls , but of course that 's the sore spot . He approves of only two . They 're sisters  --  dumbbells both . You 'll see enough of them . " " If he built you a tennis court , " said Alec , he ca n't be so awfully sore . " " Oh , Mother got that out of him . Lucky it was built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote a letter to me here and put her name on the back , and Mother got hold of it , and I had to promise not to receive any more or she 'd open them and show them to Father . " " How are you going to stop her  --  I mean Gladys ? " " That 's it ! How can I ? " Alec sought a pleasanter theme . " These two sisters here  --  what 's the matter with them ? " HONOR THY FATHER 151 " Say ! Would you believe it , they 're named Whistle ! Betty Whistle and Blanche . Wish I could offer you something better , old boy . " " You know , " said Alec philosophically , " this is very interesting ! From what I saw of you in collegeI 'd say you knew your way around , and here I find you tied to apron strings . " Tom bristled . " What would you do in my place ? " " I 'd have it out with my father . Just put the cards on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all right . " " Yeah ? " " If parents understand you and meet you half way , we owe them something . Mine have been swell always , I must say . But if they turned sour on me , I 'd walk out . I ought n't to have come up here  --  you should have visited me in Trenton ! " Tom made a wry face . " I could n't have got the carfare out of him . Trenton is full of sin . " Depressed by this prophecy of the Illings household , Alec could think up nothing more to say , so they sped on in silence . Once , as they dodged a wild car , and another time when they nearly ran over a foot passenger , Alec reflected that if he knew as much about driving as Tom did , he would try hacking , and get himself a taxi . But it did n't seem worth while to mention it . " We might as well go home , " said Tom . " We152 BACHELOR-OF ARTScan leave your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch ? " When they drove into the Illings place , Alec noticed at once the spaciousness of the grounds  --  a pretty big place compared to his Trenton home . Half an acre , or perhaps more . You could come in on one side and circle up to the door , and then out another gate , and in the center of the front patch of lawn thus carved by the drive there was a life-size statue of a stag , a spirited animal of cast iron painted annually to resemble bronze . The stag had just had a new coat . The lawn was neatly clipped . Further back , on the right side of the house , he saw the screens of the new tennis court . The house , brick and stone , was solid and square , of no particular style of architecture . In the hall Mrs. Illings greeted him , and he would have liked her had he not been already prejudiced . Her hair had once been yellow , and it turned gray with difficulty . She wore it bound rather tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still more circular . Her eyes were kind , but they seemed weak . To aid them she wore on her abundant bosom two contraptions into which gold chains were coiled , and from which dangled two pairs of glasses . It struck Alec as funny that she could pull out of either breast a better eyesight , merely by lifting the glasses to her nose and uncoiling the gold chain . When she was through with the lenses , she droppedHONOR THY FATHER 153them , and the spring coiled them into her bosom . " Tom has been so impatient ! " she said . " We 've heard of you all last winter ! " Tom cut the greeting short . " I 'll show him his room , Mother . We 're going to play tennis . Come on , Alec . " " Do n't forget your father ! " Mrs. Illings called up the stairs . " You must bring him home for lunch , you know . " " Oh , all right ! " Alec noticed the resignation in his friend 's voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second set Tom consulted his watch and stopped the game . " There 's just time for a shower if we hurry . When I 'm late , the old man gives me hell . " They were , in fact , three minutes late . As they turned into Liberty Street , Tom saw the time on a clock outside a watchmaker 's store . He mutteredsomething which conveyed irritation and disgust . " You wait out here . I 'll beard him inside . " The bearding process took five minutes , and when Tom came out again , his face was sullen . Behind him walked a stout man of middle stature , neatly dressed , with a very white , broad-brimmed straw hat . He wore side whiskers in a style which Alec had always associated with Queen Victoria 's husband . There was no mustache , however . A wide , straight mouth , with thin lips. 154 BACHELOR-OF ARTS " Very glad to see you , my boy ! Very glad to see you ! " Alec got out of the car , and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . The hand and the words were cordial , but Mr. Illings exuded an atmosphere of patient righteousness . " Get back there in the front seat , " he said . " I 'll sit behind . " Tom started the car with less than proper care , and the clutch caught with a sharp jerk . " Have n't I told you not to do that ? " Tom did n't answer , and Alec looked ahead , pretendingnot to hear . Around the corner they scraped the fender of a delivery wagon , suddenly turning out . " My God ! " cried Mr. Illings . " Ca n't you drive ? What 's the matter with you boys , anyway ? " For Tom 's sake Alec was glad to be included in the blame . The responsibility was , so to speak , halved . At the lunch table Mr. Illings was more amiable . He made courteous inquiries about Alec 's people , and recalled prominent Trentonians with whom he had contacts of one sort or another . More specificallyhe probed into the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's studies at the University , and expressed admiration for its President , whose economicideas he pronounced in most instances sound . He had sent Tom to the University , he explained , HONOR THY FATHER 155because of his admiration for the President but he had reason to fear that in these large schools the great minds and the students do not sufficiently meet . He had not yet been able to detect in Tom the good effect of the President 's personal influence . Very politely he asked Alec if Columbia was not from that point of view too large . " Oh , I do n't know , sir . I 've met the President . " You correspond with him , " corrected Tom . Mr. Illings was impressed . " Indeed ! " Mrs. Illings had her mind on creature comforts . " Do you live at home ? " " My , no ! I could n't commute from Trenton . I live in the dormitory . " She was sympathetic . " Tom tried that last year . He was quite wretched . He likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Tom . " It 's a choice of miseries , " he said . " They 're both pretty rotten . " At this word rotten , Mr. Illings glanced up , failing to recognize the President 's personal influence . Mrs. Illings tried once more to guide the talk into pleasant paths . " How will you boys amuse yourselves this after-noon ? " " Oh , we 'll sit around and gossip . If we had the car , we might drop up and call on those two Whistles . " 156 BACHELOR-OF ARTS " Your father , " said Mrs. Illings , " needs the car . " " Sure ! " " What language ! " said Mr. Illings . " Sure ! " " Well , you do need the car , do n't you , Dad ? " " When I was your age , " said Mr. Illings , " I found my amusements with my own sex . We used to meet the girls only at intervals  --  at dances , and formal parties . When I wanted to go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to a baseball game at a later age , I sought out another boy . If a girl had come along , it would have spoiled the fun . Now , I understand , you young men ca n't watch a football game without a girl to help you . " Tom winked at Alec across the table , and the guest rose to the occasion . " Do n't you believe in progress , Mr. Illings ? My father says life was pretty slow when he was young . " His life may have been , " said Mr. Illings . " Mine was not . " " Tom , " said his mother , " could n't you walk over to the Whistles ' ? " " Gosh , Mother ! It 's a mile and a half ! " " Do I understand , " asked Mr. Illings , " that thattennis court was needed for exercise ? Do you declineother forms of locomotion ? " Alec had no difficulty in understanding Tom 's plight . The old man kept after you like a terrier . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HONOR THY FATHER 157a few minutes later , he drove off in the car , his parting remark seemed teasing rather than selfish . " Let 's see how much you boys really think of those girls ! If you hoof it for three miles , I 'll believe in you . " Three miles for the Whistles ? " groaned Tom , as the car moved off . They strolled around the house to the garden behind the tennis court . " Let 's sit here under a tree . He usually stays home nights . We 'll run over and call on those two disasters after supper . " Tom was at his best just then . He asked about Mimi , and otherwise showed friendly concern for Alec 's welfare . It was one of those youthful talks which set friendship years ahead . Alec always remembered it . The way Tom spoke of happiness , wishing it for himself as well as for his friend , made Alec forget the episode with Gladys . Tom , for all his recklessness , had his ideals , and was discontented with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of the difference between his father and Tom 's , and of the advantage of being in love with Mimi , even if bliss was deferred . He was beginning to enjoy the visit . The two weeks for which he had been invited would pass smoothly . After supper Mr. Illings surrendered the car , with a reasonable measure of graciousness . He did not tease Tom for having failed to walk the three158 BACHELOR-OF ARTSmiles . He merely remarked casually to his wife that Mr. Wallace had visited the office for a moment that afternoon , and had sent his regards . At the mention of Mr. Wallace , Tom 's expressionchanged . He withdrew Alec from the family circle and got him upstairs . " Come into my room a moment , will you ? " The clothes closet in Tom 's room was large enough to hold his trunk . He unlocked the trunk and took out two flasks and a dark bottle . He filled the flasks and handed one to Alec . " Put this on your hip for courage . No prohibitionistcould face a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things ! They move in the dry cir-cles . " " Then they wo n't approve of this ? " " They do n't approve of anything , but we need strength . " Alec accepted the flask and stowed it away . " Did you hear him speak of Wallace ? That 's the fellow who saw me in the hotel , with Gladys . Dad was warning me to behave . Rather subtle of him , was n't it ! " " How do you mean behave ? " " He 's got a dirty mind , that 's how ! He thinks it 's all over with the Whistles if we give way to our evil impulses . He just clings to the hope that by some good accident we wo n't disgrace him . That man has never had any faith in me . " HONOR THY FATHER 159The Whistles lived in a frame house , less than the mile away . Tom had exaggerated the distance . A wooden house , Colonial , before it changed its mind , but comfortable , and on one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aids to comfort . Apparently the Whistle family and their guests took their ease . Alec wondered at the unpopularitywhich Tom had ascribed to the Whistle girls . They were both blondes , of no particular shade  --  just normal blondes . Betty , the elder , had brown eyes , and Blanche had blue . Betty was tall , Blanche plump . They both had , if not charm , at least a cordiality which made you glad they were around . To Alec they did not appear emotionally starved . Perhaps Tom really admired one of them , and had been setting up a barrage . It was clear enough which one Tom liked . When the girls invited them to be seated , he made directly for the swinging sofa in front of which Blanche stood , and with a firm arm around her waist drew her down beside him . She succumbed willingly . Those two , Alec perceived , had been there before . Tom was an awful liar ! Alec balanced himself on the other swing , with Betty , glad that she had fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he . She made him think of Mimi  --  she had the same poise . Very much at home in the world . Very kind . Not beautiful , but a16o BACHELOR  --  OF ARTSgood sort . On closer inspection , parts of her were beautiful  --  a complexion the advertisements praise , and beautiful teeth , and such a hearty smile , you would n't accuse her of showing the teeth off . Since Tom had his arm around Blanche 's waist , Alec did n't want to seem cold . He laid his hand on Betty 's , and finding it a comforting hand , squeezed it . She squeezed back . Swell girl ! She and Blanche wore summer dresses , startlingly sheer . He did n't notice it at first , but then a glance at Betty in just the right light gave him more grounds for thinking her beautiful . Not for a moment was he disloyal to Mimi . Not for a moment ! But since he had to spend an eveningwith the Whistles , he thanked heaven that one of them at least was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a party , somewhere in St. Louis , that very night ? The hand-holding was not enough to fill an eveningfor Betty . " What do you boys want to do ? We 're not going to sit here all evening , are we , with that car champingat the curb ? " Gladys might have said the same words , but from Betty they sounded decorous . You knew she was proposing a ride , not a riot . As a matter of fact , " said Tom , " if it 's a choice between sitting in a car or sitting in a swing , I like the swing . " HONOR THY FATHER 161Betty laughed . " just as furniture , eh ? " To reassure Blanche that comfort was not all , Tom put his hand against the back of her head and turned it around so he could kiss her . Betty looked at Alec . " What can we do with these young saps ? " Alec accepted the question as a scientific inquiry . " I 'm not much for necking or petting myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and looked sympathetic , as though he had confessed an infirmity . " If you have a victrola in the house , " he went on , we might dance . " She stood up , delighted . " That 's it ! The roadhouse ! Come on , Tom ! Crank the chariot ! " The roadhouse was nothing to brag of , and few people were there , but it had a small dance floor , and an audible orchestra . Betty danced well , even eloquently ; one of those girls , as Alec reflected , who will meet you more than half way . Blanche was another matter . He changed off and danced with her twice , just for manners . Though she knew all the steps , she put into them nothing personal . She might as well have been a dancing teacher , for all the fun he got out of it . The two flasks were quickly emptied , with a little help from Blanche and a great deal from Betty . Though Betty liked hers straight , it seemed to162 BACHELOR-OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so little kinder , but Alec was n't sure . She had been kind before she drank . The evening passed too quickly . Tom was pullinghis arm as they met midway in a dance . " This is absolutely the last one . It 's eleventhirty . If I drive at sixty miles , perhaps we can make the front door by midnight . " Apparently the girls understood the threat of Illings , senior , for they gathered their wraps quickly , and joined the boys in a race for the car . Tom got up to his sixty miles . And promptly blew out a tire . They swerved into an empty lot . Blanche , in the front seat , screamed , and increased their risk by clutching Tom around the throat . Betty sat very still . Alec began to think highly of her . " Now how the devil could that happen ? " said Tom , examining the ruined tire with his flashlight . " Damn it ! Here it is . Did you ever see such a nail ? " Alec took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rubber , but Tom clutched his hand . " Push it back in , man ! We 'll need it for evi-dence ! " They got the tire changed , and were half an hour late at the Illings ' porch . Mr. Illings had left open the door of the bedroom where he and Mrs. Illings reposed side by side . HONOR THY FATHER i63 " Is that you , boys ? " he called . " Yes , sir , " answered Tom , locking the front door , and adding under his breath , " He knows darn well it is ! I 'm going to be late for breakfast . " Alec , unluckily , came to breakfast on time , and spilled the beans . They had been delayed , he explained , by picking up a nail , and when Mr. Illings was sure you could n't find a nail on the city pavements , Alec said it was n't a city pavement  --  it was the suburban stretch on the way to the roadhouse . Mr. Illings dropped his spoon in his coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Alec , " we just went out to the roadhouse for a little dance , and on the way back " Roadhouse ! " repeated Mr. Illings . " Did my son take you to a roadhouse ? " Perceiving his error too late , Alec hastened to protect Tom . " It was my idea , sir . I proposed a dance , and we asked Tom to drive us out . " " Who 's we ? " demanded Mr. Illings . " Not the Whistle girls ? " " No , sir , " said Alec , chivalrously . " It was my idea . " Tom and he thought they 'd better be discreet for a couple of days , and play tennis , and sit around the house , or just walk into town to see a movie . Off and on they discussed what to do with one 's parents. 164 BACHELOR  --  OF ARTS " Has he always been this way ? " asked Alec , with frank sympathy . " It 's grown on him . " " Are n't there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel better if your friends were boys ? " Toni shook his head . " Of course there are nice fellows , but he 's insulted them , one by one . He does n't mean to , of course , and it 's all for my good , but they get insulted just the same . If I had n't gone away to college , I would n't have a single friend . " After the two prudent days Alec was bored . Perhapsif he had admitted all his motives , he wished to see Betty again . Not that he was forgetful of Mimi ! Not in the slightest ! But a fellow has to have some society , even if the only girl in the world is in St. Louis . " I say , Mr. Illings , " he broke out boldly toward the end of the evening meal , " how about risking that car once more ? Tom and I want to see the Whistles , and he 's afraid to ask since I led him into temptation . This time I 'll behave like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Illings ' thin lips broadened into a smile . " Do n't think anybody will mistake you for a dea-con . " Tom backed him up . " How about the car , Dad ? " " I 'll drive you down myself , " said his father , HONOR THY FATHER 165 " and then I 'll call for you again at eleven o'clock . " They missed none of the implications in this apparentlyfriendly offer . " Anyway , " said Tom , " it 's better than nothing . Maybe the girls will bring out the domino board , and we can have a wild game . " He repeated this remark later to Blanche , and she , willing to please , would have brought out the dominoes if he had n't stopped her . Betty started the victrola on the porch , but the floor was too rough . " Why do n't we go inside , " asked Alec , " and turn back the rug ? " Betty suppressed the idea promptly . " It would disturb Father and Mother . " He realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered why they were kept in the background  --  and then forgot about them . He had Betty beside him , and Tom and Blanche at the other end of the porch . Some remarks were bandiedbetween the swings . Gradually each couple confined themselves to their own conversation . Gradually each couple were silent . Passing cars honked , and dim headlights , sweeping the darkness off the porch , revealed four figures in groups of two , clutching each other like drowning persons . Alec did n't know he wanted to kiss Betty until her head was on his shoulder , and her lips there for the taking . He had told the truth when he said166 BACHELOR-OF ARTShe was n't much for necking or petting , but he had one arm around her , and something about her back tempted his hand to explore . He explored thoroughly . For a brief second he wondered why she wore that kind of dress , but the question did n't detain him . He did n't mean to maul her with the other hand , the way vulgar fellows do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they strolled up her side and found what he had noticed beneath the sheer dress , she kissed him much harder . At that point he could see no reason to stop , not though a car coming up the street suddenly turned its searchlight on them . A ray of the searchlight squeezed in between one of her eyes and his . He could see the eye gleam . " May I interrupt ? " said a bitter and damning voice . Alec detached himself from bliss and recognized Mr. Illings . The old fox must have gum-shoed right up on them ! Next morning Alec had a letter from Mimi , forwardedfrom Trenton . It was waiting on the breakfast table beside his plate . Mr. Illings was waiting there too , with his wife and his son . " If you accept the hospitality of my house , young man , you must assume , even temporarily , the conventionsof decency ! On no other terms are you welcome ! " He said more , but that was the point . Alec didHONOR THY FATHER 167not argue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought news which made it necessary for him to go back to Trenton at once . She looked at him sadly and reproachfully , but his heart was hardenedagainst her criticism . It was a warm day . Buxom creature that she was , she wore at that moment the kind of filmy dress that had been his undoing the night before . He summoned a taxi , so that he could catch the noon train before Mr. Illings came home to lunch . Tom went gloomily with him to the station , and saw him off . They thought , of course , that only the stupid scolding had torn him away , but in part , at least , it was Mimi 's letter . Or rather , it was his own horror , discovering in himself something not unlikepassion for Betty , even when Mimi was his true love . This division was shameful ! He feared he was a special case , abnormal and unworthy . He went back home to grieve . Alec Does Something for the CollegeAT HOME again in his father 's house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third floor , where through boyhood he had passed his hours of sleep or of study . The windows were raised high , and the pleasant summer air stirred around him . He had his coat off for comfort . He could look down on the upper branches of the trees which shaded Atterbury Avenue . This letter was hard to write . He tore up the first attempt , and tried again . " Mimi , my dear " I 'm just back from Binghamton  --  got home late last night . Here I am telling you I love you , and there was n't a girl in Binghamtonwho could keep me from thinking about you all the time . " Tom sends his best regards . He has a father who is good till it hurts . When I see you , I 'll give the lowdown , but if I wrote about it here , the post office might open the envelope , and arrest me for sending indecent matter through the mails. 168SOMETHING FOR THE COLLEGE 169 " What I want to know is , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ask , are you coming , but when . I 'll be at the train to meet you . " He could have stopped there , of course , but consciencepushed him on . " There was one girl in Binghamton who made me think of you . A grand looker . I spent the last evening in a hammock with her , but that was O.K. , because Tom was right alongside in another hammock with her sis-ter . " If that worried her , so much the better ! Had n't she told him about the men in St. Louis ? Doggone it ! The letter was perfect now , without another word ! Her reply staggered him . " I 'm so glad you had that visit with Tom . It would n't have been fair if all the fun had come to me this summer while you were mopingthere in Trenton . I 'm glad you had that necking party with that girl . I 'm sure she enjoyed it , and it probably did you lots of good . I hope you knew enough not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . I 'm glad you miss me . Alec dear , I 've been missing you just as much as you missed me . " I70 BACHELOR-OF ARTSGosh ! How did she guess all that ! For the remainder of the day his sisters and his mother commentedupon his wistful melancholy . Next morning , however , he was at his desk again . " You did n't say when you were coming back to New York . Do n't keep me in suspense ! As soon as I 've seen you and collected the kisses you owe me , I 'll tell you all about that girl , if you 're so much interested . You 'll think it 's funny , when you hear the facts . " He had to wait a week for her answer . " I 'm not sure I 'm coming this autumn , Alec dear . I ca n't now , anyway , unless the drugstore gives me back my job . Another girl has it , and my boss does n't know whether she wishes to stay . Father thinks I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alec counted his small change , to see whether he had enough for a good , long night-letter to St. Louis . Then he slipped downstairs , avoiding the family , and with the help of the trolley , reached the Western Union . " ARE YOU COMING , OR ARE YOU NOT ? IF NOT I SHA N'T GO BACK TO COLLEGE . YOU ARE ALL I CARE ABOUT . FOR HEAVEN 'S SAKE ! " ( Unsigned ) SOMETHING FOR THE COLLEGE 171He rather hoped for a wire the next day . When none arrived , he made himself believe she was economizing , and there would be a night letter the day following . But there was n't . Being short of funds at the moment , he resorted once more to the postal service . " Mimi , my darling ! " Did you get that telegram ? Why do n't you answer ? " I suppose you think I am conceited , hopingyou will come back to that drugstore , where I can see you every day , but if you knew how I feel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a wash-out so far . If the men in St. Louis are n't better than I am , your home town ought to be wiped out like " At this point he went into the hall and walled down to his mother , requesting , to her surprise , a copy of the Bible . He was disappointed not to find the volume indexed , but by turning the pages carefullyfrom the first chapter of Genesis on , he found the help he sought . Back at his desk , he finished the sentence , " like Sodom and Gomorrha . I do n't know a thing , I ca n't do a thing , and I have n't earned a cent . So if you decide you 'd rather have some other husband  --  well , I always knew you had a swell brain . But I love you , and I miss you like hell . " 172 BACHELOR-OF ARTSThree days later he got a telegram . " IF YOU 'VE GIVEN UP BEING CONCEITED I MIGHT TRY THE DRUGSTORE AGAIN . DATE UN-DECIDED . " After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trenton intolerable . The early September days were bringing college near . Suddenly , but firmly , he informed the household that he would leave at once for Columbia , and join the football squad . The coach , he assured them , desired his aid in the autumn practice . His father took this news with some skepticism , but let him go . The old man , Alec noticed again , accepted these departures with a resignation which did n't seem normal . In the train he thought out his plans . He would drive directly to the drugstore , and speak to Mimi . Then he would take his bags to the fraternity house , where there would be plenty of empty rooms . Then he would go up to Baker Field and offer himself to the coach . Then he would ask the clerk in Earl Hall if they 'd reserve his room for him in John Jay , that same familiar cell , till after the football season . This schedule , faithfully followed , produced a depressingseries of disappointments . Mimi was n't at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cashier 's desk pretended never to have heardSOMETHING FOR THE COLLEGE 173of her . It was a sweltering job , carrying the bags to the house , and none of the fellows was there  --  nobody but the janitor , who lacked cordiality . The subway up to Baker Field was hot as a furnace . The practice was going on , and he could n't interrupt . He stood on the edge of the field , and was a little hurt that no one stopped work to greet him . When the drill was finished , he approached the coach , who was talking with a large , well-dressed man , muscular but dapper . A banker , Alec guessed , or a floor-walker . They stared at him as he came up . The large , well-dressed man kept or . staring while the coach talked . " To be frank , Hamilton , you 're not worth a whoop ! You have n't played enough to speak of , but the worst is , you 're not serious . I looked up your record last spring . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste time on you , and lick you into shape , you 'll fail a course , and that will be that . " " This year I 'm going to study ! " " Easy to promise . Maybe you ca n't ! " Alec looked up at the coach , with his big nose and powerful chin , and strong eyes in spite of spectacles . Quite a man . The kind you 'd like to persuade to think well of you . " You give me one chance , sir ! I do n't expect to play in any of the games174 BACHELOR-OF ARTS " Then why teach you ? " " I mean , not this year  --  unless you find me good enough . " " You 'll never play unless I find you good enough ! " " I mean , I 'll work hard , and after you 've tried me , if you want to kick me off , that 'll be all right . I 'll study . I swear I will ! " The coach mopped his brow with his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll find a place for you in the Manor House . It 's a full time job , you know . " " Yes , sir . " " When college opens , you 'll go down for your classes , you 'll eat at the training table in John Jay , you 'll stick around here for your football and your studying . " " Do n't I get out in the evening ? " " In the evening you study , " said the coach , " and if there 's any time left over , we 'll do a little blackboardwork . " " Yes , sir . . . . How long does this last , sir ? Till Thanksgiving ? " The coach turned on his heel . " Do n't come ! I knew you were n't serious . " Alec had been humble long enough . " Look here , sir ! Give me credit for not being a fool ! I want to reserve a room in the dormitory so I can have a place to live the rest of the year ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , get your room . See you tomorrow . " It was too late that afternoon to arrange about the room in John Jay . He had supper at the Gold Rail , hoping to find a companion , but though the room was crowded , he found there no one he knew . Afterwards he went to the Nemo for a picture , and then repaired to the house for a night of utter loneliness . Next morning he sought breakfast at Mimi 's drugstore , out of sentiment , and was waiting at Earl Hall when the renting office opened . His old room might be reserved , the clerk explained , if it were free , but Alec had forgotten to put in a claim when he gave it up in the spring , and now Professor Barth had it . That was the prof Tom had said was starving . " Gosh , I 'm sorry ! I liked the old cell . Can you find another for the same price , and hold it for me till after football season ? " While the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy man came up behind Alec . Can I change my mind ? " The clerk was deferential . " Oh , how are you , Professor Barth ! What can we do for you ? " Alec turned to look at the person who was to sleep in his bed , gaze in his mirror , wash in his bowl . A regular prof ! Young , but weak-eyed and underfed . At the moment , however , for some reason happy. 176 BACHELOR  --  OF ARTS " I  --  er  --  I 've just got married , " said Barth proudly , " and I dare say I ca n't take my wife to the dormitory . Will you relieve me of that room ? " With so remarkable a coincidence under his eyes , the clerk forgot to congratulate the bridegroom . " Why , Mr. Hamilton was just asking for his old room back ! " Professor Barth smiled paternally . " How fortunatewe both are , Hamilton ! That 's settled , then . " Alec resented the familiarity . " Hamilton ! " As though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Before he left for Baker Field that afternoon , he looked in at the drugstore to make sure . No news of her yet . He went back to the house , picked up one bag with just the most necessary things in it , and journeyed to the Manor House , where Sam Briggs , a fellow sophomore , taught him the ropes . Sam was experienced , having played on the freshmanteam . As they walked to the field , with others of the scrub , Alec saw the coach in deep converse with that large , well-dressed man , banker or floorwalker , who had been there the day before . He nudged Sam . Who is he ? " " Bill Barrows . Do n't you know him ? " " What 's he do ? " SOMETHING FOR THE COLLEGE 177 " He 's our patron saint ! Played tackle in the dark ages  --  somewhere around 1900 . He 's here every afternoon . " " Does n't he have to earn a living ? " At the end of the season he 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . " Several of the squad laughed . " What do you mean , staked ? " He helped me out last year , " explained Briggs . " I could n't have stayed in college . He 's a damn fine sport . " Later , when the practice came to a convenient pause , Barrows sauntered up to the newcomer . Alec saw an iron jaw and piercing eyes . Perhaps the jaw was n't naturally of iron , perhaps the eyes had not been predestined to pierce . A rather kind , simple face , if the aggressive manner had not been cultivated . The face reminded Alec of a wellmeaning " Y " man who had addressed the highschoolboys at Trenton , and who , in the cause of the spirit , had counseled them to be he-males , and take a fighting attitude toward life . " Glad you 're out for the team , " said Barrows . " You 'll have to work ! The coach tells me you can run , and if he could teach you where to run , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between pauses , and Alec understood that this talk was for his good . " Yes , sir . " I78 BACHELOR  --  OF ARTSYou must study , too . No flunkers wanted on the team ! " " Yes , sir . " Of course Alec had heard of football in the dark ages  --  around Igoo  --  when the team had not been famed for scholarship . According to the legend , the difficulty in those days was to persuade the gladiators even to register for a class , the relation between the sport and the university being at that time fragile , not to say hypothetical . Alec wondered whether Barrows in his heyday had ever been escorted to a classroom door by the coach 's strong arm squad , or whether he had taken to learning by instinct . The training routine was monotonous . Daily he slipped down to Morningside to see who was countingcash at the drugstore , but the rest of the time he tore up and down Baker Field , getting cursed out when he missed a catch or a tackle , or when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did his best , but the coach remarkedpublicly after one play that never had he seen willingness come to such a bad end , and he added , unexpectedly philosophical , that hell would never be paved with Alec 's good intentions , because if Alec aimed at hell , he would miss it by a mile . When he told Alec , just before college opened , that he might stay on the squad , he mixed the news with sarcasm . SOMETHING FOR THE COLLEGE 179 " I like your spirit , and the squad is frightfully small . If we have bad luck with the regular ends , I must put some one in , even a dummy . It 's a disgraceto stop a game for lack of cannon fodder . " As he teased , he smiled , and Alec remembered how Tom had pledged him to the fraternity  --  also because the squad was small . Next morning , when he went down to the University , he met Tom just in front of the Van Am memorial . For a second he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ? How are the folks ? " Tom grinned , and the shadow of the Binghamton visit lifted . " That 's one time you did n't make a hit ! You should have heard him describe your character to Wallace ! Compared with you , I am a very amateur Don Juan . " Alec grinned in turn . " How are the Whistles ? " " Oh , just poking along in their quiet way . Mimi 's back . " " No ! " " Saw her in the drugstore . . . . Here ! Where are you going ? I want to talk to you about the rushing . " Alec paused unwillingly , and Tom stepped after him . " What sort of fraternity man are you , with your mind on the women " I8o BACHELOR  --  OF ARTS " I 'm too busy to help with the rushing , " explainedAlec . " I have n't told you yet  --  I 'm on the football team . At least on the squad . " Tom acted a spasm of horror . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty work ! " Alec was in a hurry . " Listen , old man , I 'll help all I can , but when I 'm not in class , I must be at the Manor House . You fellows can pick my new brothers for me . " " Ca n't you look in on us between your engagementswith the coach and Mimi ? " " There wo n't be any brief moments . " " There must be ! A football hero is natural bait for freshmen . " " You go to hell ! " called Alec cheerfully , as he disappeared through the passage to Amsterdam . She was in the drugstore , as Tom had said . She looked older , and even more beautiful than he had remembered . For a second they just gazed at each other . " God ! but I 'm glad to see you ! " " I , too , Alec ! " She let him take both her hands in his , then pulled herself away , for discretion 's sake . " I never was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I want to kiss you ! " She laughed . " The boss would n't appreciate it . " He tried to think of something practical . " Why did n't you write me ? " SOMETHING FOR THE COLLEGE I81 " To the last minute I did n't know whether I was coming . First , the drugstore had no place for me , then Father thought I ought to stay home till he could send me to Barnard . He 's sensitive about my working . His business is improving . " Alec overlooked the possible importance of this news , though she had written about her father 's return to prosperity . The father of your belovedrarely occupies a prominent place in your thoughts . " I say , Mimi , I 'm on the football squad ! " " Oh , I meant to congratulate you . That 's wonderful , Alec ! " " You heard about it ? " " Just a minute ago . " Who told you ? " The shining in her eye 's , which had been pride for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " " Do n't be jealous , but Professor Woolsey was here . " With an effort Alec answered casually . " I have n't seen him yet myself . Is he well ? " She laughed , as though glad of a chance to laugh . " I did n't ask him  --  he looked all right . " " So he was talking to you about me , was he ? " " I wanted to find out where you were . Alec dear , I came back just for you . " A ; customer insisted on putting down a check and182 BACHELOR-OF ARTSsome cash . The interruption was a relief to both . When they were alone again , Mimi leaned forward . " Wait in the hallway ! I 'll tell the boss I 'm going to my room . " He stood inside the open door , gazing across the street at hospital convalescents who were enjoying the sun . She followed him quickly with that eager , vital step of hers . In the shadow of the hall he had the kiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Alec ! " " Darling ! " She held him away , with her hands on his shoulders . " I 'm so glad about the football ! You can be such a brilliant person , Alec ! Do everything well ! " He drew her to him again . Words would have been clumsy . " Alec , why are you playing football ? " He was puzzled by the inconsistency of the question . " You just said you wanted me to ! " " Are you doing it for me ? " " I wanted to get back here early . You did n't tell me when you were coming . " This time it was she who offered the kiss . With her face against him , she whispered . " Did you find any one else you loved ? " Betty came to mind , but he pushed the unwelcomememory away . SOMETHING FOR THE COLLEGE 183Not one . I thought of you every moment . " In a sense it was true . Even while he was manhandlingBetty , Mimi had been on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , " but that does n't mean love . If you spoke too quickly last year , if you made a mistake , it 's all right . We can be friends , and you can go free . " He was amazed at the sudden change . Her voice suggested tears . " God , Mimi ! I love you ! " She put her head on his shoulder , and for a secondor two he patted her shoulder , for lack of other inspiration . " Alec , I was miserable all summer ! I thought you had grown tired of me ! I did hope you 'd come out to St. Louis . If I were a man , and loved a girl , I 'd look her up . " He was stunned . He had n't once thought of goingto St. Louis . Was that what one ought to do ! Of course , now that she mentioned it , it seemed a good idea . " My folks kept me at home , " he explained weakly . You went to Binghamton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straightened up , pushed her red hair from her eyes , and was her old self . " I 'm silly ! Of course you could n't run around the country after me ! I was just lonely . Now184 BACHELOR-OF ARTSwe 'll have a wonderful winter . . . . I must go back to the desk . " He comforted himself with a Gargantuan embrace , to last till the next day . As they sauntered around to the drugstore , he tried to stretch out the little distance . From now on , I 'll study like the devil  --  a regularmark-hunter ! " " I hate to say good-bye now , " she confided , " just when I have you again ! I 'm a bold woman , Alec ! Take me out to Childs tonight ! " He stood shifting from foot to foot . " Gosh , Mimi ! I must eat at the Manor House . " " Of course  --  I forgot . " He could always count on her to be a sport . Swell girl ! " I 'll stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games . I 'll get you a ticket . " " But I should n't care to go alone . " " Tom will bring you  --  or maybe you know a girl . " She laughed , and her teasing mood returned . " I ' 11 go to the games  --  some of them  --  I 've had several nice invitations . Play your best , and I 'll cheer ! " He tore himself away , and walked back toward Hamilton Hall , both elated and depressed . This mention of the games made him see that his autumn would be tedious , troubled , and probably inglorious . There would have been satisfaction in knowSOMETHINGFOR THE COLLEGE 185ing that she watched from the sidelines , had he been a competent football hero , likely to make a touchdown . In that case he would n't have objected to some other man as her escort , because a passive spectatorwould come off badly in comparison with an inspired runner , flashing to victory in a roar of cheers . But now , hang it ! they both would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bench wrapped up in a blanket , and the other man would have a better seat next to Mimi ! Of course someone would take her to the games ! Woolsey , perhaps . Well , since she did n't love Woolsey , there was no point in worrying . At least he would make a respectable escort . Why not say hello to Woolsey now ? It would be the chivalrous thing  --  rival to rival . When he knocked at the office door at the top of Hamiton Hall , he heard a loud " Come in ! " The gaunt man was loafing back in his desk chair , with his hands behind his back , laughing up at a still more gaunt person , very thin indeed , standing with his back to the door . " Hello , Hamilton ! How are you ? " Woolsey rose and came toward him . The other man , without looking around , moved away toward the window . " Glad to see you ! How was your summer ? You know Professor Barth . " The thin man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had my dormitory room . " " You relieved me by taking it back . " " As a matter of fact , I 'm at the Manor House . On the football squad . " He added this to impress Woolsey , then remembered that Woolsey knew it already . " If you want advice about your studies this year , " said that gentleman , " why do n't you take a course with Barth ? " " I 'd like to , but my schedule is made out . " " Well , you can change it . You ought to know something about the Renaissance . " Alec considered Barth carefully , noting that his eyes were deep and fine , or would be if he had n't strained them . The lenses in the spectacles were thick . He had a high forehead and a kind mouth  --  a dreamy mouth but thick lips  --  the kind of lips which can appreciate beauty . Alec recalled what Tom had said of him . " You ought to take Barth 's course this year , Hamilton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a good mark . " Barth laughed . " See you again , Woolsey ! " He nodded to Alec , and went his way . Woolsey 's cheerfulness continued . " Sit down ! Have a cigarette ? That man 's a great teacher . I meant what I said  --  you ought to study with him . Gad ! I 'm glad to see him so happy ! He 's married a fine woman . " SOMETHING FOR THE COLLEGE 187Alec wondered where a man like Barth would meet a fine woman . He would ask Tom about it later . " I 'd take his course , sir , if the Dean would let me change . " " What are you studying this year ? " " I 've got to go on with English , and French , and Math . And Contemporary Civilization still keeps up . " " It 's good for you . " " It was n't last year , sir , and in the catalog this new instalment sounds pretty bad . What do I care about the organization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distributivemechanisms , and financial structure ? The catalog says that the course will end , if it ever does end , with the presentation of the various estimatesand criticisms of the contemporary social order . ' " Woolsey laughed . " Do you know the catalog by heart ? " " It 's the kind of mind I have , sir . Crazy things stay with me . " Woolsey laughed again . " So football is now your ruling passion , eh ? " " I am playing football , sir . " He hoped Woolsey would get the distinction . " Why are you playing ? " He could n't tell him it was to be near the drug-188 BACHELOR  --  OF ARTSstore before the term opened . He sought other reasons as he went along . " For exercise , in the first place . . . . Then , if you do n't mind my saying so , football is the only college subject which is properly taught . " " Interesting ! How so ? " " Why , sir , they insist on your doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to do it well . History , now , or English , or this Contemporary Civilization  --  they'rejust subjects to talk about . " Alec stopped to enjoy the fresh charm of this idea , which had just come to him . " Go on , " said Woolsey . " That 's all , sir . In football , if I carry out a play , and help the team to score , I know what I 've done . It 's practical . But you take my courses last year  --  I passed them , but I did n't learn a thing . " " How do you know you did n't ? " " Well , there 's nothing left that I can use . " Woolsey listened , not hostile . " There 's much in what you say . If you take a History course , you should become a historian , if an English course , a writer . That 's what you 'd like , is it ? " Alec rubbed the back of his head . " I 'm not sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you be glad to master what you study , so that you could be a historian , a writer , or an economist , if you wish ? InsteadSOMETHING FOR THE COLLEGE 189of just listening to our talk about these matters ? " Alec tried again . " The courses I have to take in college would be all right if I could use them later in life , but I do n't want to be a historian , or a literary man . What I studied last year would be good if I wanted to be a professor , but I do n't . I want to be educated . I ought to be able to keep on all my life with whatever I begin to study at col-lege . " " I take it , " said Woolsey , " you intend to be a professional football player . " Alec knew he could n't be asking the question in good faith . There ought to be a smart answer to his sarcasm . It did n't suggest itself . " Football , " continued Woolsey , " ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the only subject we teach properly . " He stared at Alec without smiling , and the boy was sorry he had called . The man was just a professor , after all , with a weakness for logic . " Did you have a good vacation ? " asked Woolsey . " Yes , sir  --  fine ! " " Where did you go ? " This year I stayed at home , at Trenton . D' you know Trenton , sir ? " " I 've been there . Rather hot in summer , is n't it ? " Alec avoided confessing the weakness of his home190 BACHELOR-OF ARTStown . " I spent a few days with Tom Illings  --  you know Illings , sir ?  --  a member of my fraternity . He lives in Binghamton . " Woolsey nodded . " Nice country up that way  --  I 've driven through it . Lovely valleys , and English sort of landscape . " Alec felt it was time to go , but he remembered his manners . " I hope you had a good summer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out West . Saw some of the Colorado parks , then came home through the Southwest . " Had he visited St. Louis ? Had he followed Mimi out there ? Had she spent whole days with him ? Was there a hammock on her father 's porch ? Alec felt the life ooze out of him . He could think of nothing to say . Ready to get up and go , he stuck to the chair , paralyzed . " I 'm glad you stopped in , " said Woolsey , rising , quite at ease , and waving him toward the door . " Do your best this year , Hamilton . If I can help , tell me . Shall I speak to the Dean now about Barth 's course ? " What matter which course he took ? He went back to Baker Field with the depression a little heavier on his spirit , and the joy of Mimi 's return a little dim . Woolsey made him feel foolish . What was he doing in college anyway ? Where was he going ? But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COLLEGE 191the scrub were battling each other , he caught the glint of familiar red hair over on the sidelines . Tom had brought her up , or perhaps she had brought Tom , . Since she was looking on , he played quite fiercely , and Bill Barrows , standing near Mimi , was impressed , and told Alec so . Strange that a man should keep his eye on football when he was standing near Mimi ! In an interval of practice Alec walked over and greeted her . He tried to saunter , as a hero should , approaching a worshipper.  |p7P  , VIILs%%Alec Finds His VoiceTHE football season passed more smoothly than he had hoped . Each day , when he finished his lunch at the training table at John Jay , he would step across to the drugstore and say hello to Mimi , and after the first few weeks , as soon as his marks justifiedit , the coach let him come down in the early evening . He would take her to the Nemo , or they 'd sit on a bench on Morningside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to the games . Tom brought her twice , Jim once , Albert once , Woolsey never . Tom must have arranged it . That is , she and Tom together . She did not see him make a touchdown , or contribute to the immortality of one who did . She never saw him play . He never played . It was a fortunate year , and the mortality among the competentwas not sufficient to bring Alec on the field . But at the end of the season Barrows shook hands with him , said that his loyalty had been appreciated , and quoted something from Milton about standing and waiting , which Alec thought misplaced , since he had been waiting but not standing. 192ALEC FINDS HIS VOICE 193For the first time in his life he studied . The coach saw to that . He began to like some of the courses -- Barth 's particularly . The thin man talked of Savonarola , of Machiavelli , or Leonardo da Vinci , as though they were alive , important neighbors . Barth had a personal admiration for them , almost pathetically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited over life . Though for the most part they also got into trouble , Barth held that they had had a grand time . Savonarola appealed to Alec more than the others , not because of the religious note , but because the monk had such desperate nerve . He was beginning to understand the charm of courage . That was Barth 's phrase . Barth said that when life opened a door to these great Renaissance men , they just took a chance and went in . And although they were virile , they were fond of the arts , like music and painting . This surprisedAlec . He had supposed that men were one thing and artists another . The evidence on the subject was mixed . The coach , for example , had never indicated an interest in painting , but on the other hand , Bill Barrows had quoted Milton . Perhaps it was his reflections on this theme which led Alec to music . Partly , of course , it was the accident to the victrolaat the house . During the football season the house had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BACHELOR-OF ARTSing sessions he had shown himself , as Tom wished , and seven freshmen , under the pull of his glamour , had been taken into the family . But now that football was over , he signed up for the first house dance , and at the last moment Mimi caught cold and had a fever , and the victrola broke down . As to Mimi , he was forced to attend the dance alone . As to the victrola , being now a strong man of the Renaissance variety , he persuaded his brethren to engage Wally Blake and his jazz orchestra . BesidesWally and his saxophone there was a piano and a violin , and of course the traps , four in all . They would perform from nine P.M. to two A.M. for ten dollars a head . Alec led seven other brethren in the painful contribution of five dollars . After two you used the victrola , if you had one , or else you took your partner to Childs and fed her . In his room in John Jay he dressed carefully for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck she had to miss the first party he could take her to that year ! When he arrived at the house , the jazz experts were operating in the middle of the second floor , between the head of the stairs where you came up and the foot of the other stairs where you sat out with your girl , if you had a girl  --  the very steps where Tom had rested disconsolate that night when Gladys had climbed over him to explore the upper regions . ALEC FINDS HIS VOICE 195Just now Tom was circling past with a nakedbackedbrunette . " Hello , Alec ! Why stag ? " " She 's got the flu , " called Alec impulsively , then regretted such a public bulletin . Thrusting his hands in his coat , he pushed through the dancing couples into the library , where on normal evenings occurred the poker games . Now it was filled with human bodies shoving around in slow motion . He sat on the window sill and studied the scene withoutsympathy . The music was good but loud . The room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the draft on his person threatened pneumonia . He noticed how the girls glued themselvesagainst their partners , and gazed up in almostliquid flattery . Loneliness caused irritation . " They ca n't all be cuckoo over their men , " he reflected . " What 's keeping her ? " inquired Tom as he waltzed by . He asked for friendship 's sake , but Alec glared at him . He had told him once . Tom steered the brunette to the other end of the floor , against the pool table , where the unattached brethren , the replacements , were waiting to be called on . " Here , Mitchell ! " he commanded . A tall freshman stepped forward . Tom put the brunette in his arms. do. 196 BACHELOR-OF ARTS " Do you mind dancing with him for a moment ? " Through the crowd he shoved to Alec 's window seat . " What 's wrong ? " " She 's sick . I told you . " " That 's tough ! " said Tom cheerfully . " Do n't let it show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need anyway . One more pair of elbows and it would be a regular log-jam . I 'll let you have the next dance with mine . " " Thanks , " said Alec , rising from the window sill and dusting off his coat . " When they stop to breathe , I 'll tell Wally Blake he 's made good with us . Wally Blake was leaning back , wiping his brow , with the saxophone shining across his knees . Alec noted once more his heavy jaw , his confident gray eye , and the aroma of success about him . " It 's swell , Wally , the fellow 's like it a lot ! " " Sure , " said Wally modestly . " We put plenty of zip in it . That 's the main thing . " He set the sax absent-mindedly to his lips , and sounded rich gurgles up and down the scale . Alec watched , fascinated . " Is it hard to play ? " " Not if you have fingers and an ear . Mostly ear . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stretched his arms wide , to rest them . " Did you take lessons ? " ALEC FINDS HIS VOICE 197 " No . Some do , but you can buy it on instalments , and there 's a book to tell you how to play . " Alec became still more thoughtful . " I suppose , when they play it well , the way you do , they make a lot of money . " Wally accepted the tribute with a slight smile . " I have n't bought a yacht yet . " During the next dance , Alec lingered near the piano , to see how Wally drew profitable sweetness from the sax , aided only by fingers and ear and a book of instructions . Several weeks later , of a Tuesday evening , he was seated on a trunk in the garret of the fraternity house . It was no larger than a closet , and you could n't stand up in it . Ventilation it had none , and its light was an electric bulb , swung low from the ceiling . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his lips , and leaned over to glean instruction from the book spread out on the floor . His instrument seemed far louder than the one Wally Blake used , and the tone was less reliable . The upper notes bleated , the low notes suggested pigs , and from the middle register came every now and then an improper threat , as though it were about to be sick . He laid the sax down , wiped his lips , lifted the book to a better light , and once more read the directions . Ah , there was the trouble  --  he shouldn't198 BACHELOR-OF ARTSblow so hard ! Steady but easy , that was the formula . No wonder he had been getting dizzy ! A minimum of breath , the book said . The melody he was working on was called The Last Rose of Summer , but it did n't sound right . Not even when he got the notes . He recalled hearingsome one say it was the original of Fair Harvard , but he could recognize Fair Harvard with his eyes shut , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be critical when the book was thrown in free . He did the first line over , several times . Now it began to come  --  but how mournful ! Gosh , in a moment he 'd make himself cry ! He started again , a bit faster , to brighten it up . So intent on his work was he , he did not hear the footsteps mounting to his studious retreat . The garret door flung open . Two angry faces blinked at his dazzling bulb . " Clean daft ! " roared Tom . " Off his nut ! " Albert , the other visitor , expressed a more preciseresentment . " We 're here to stop this Godawfulracket ! " " Shut the door , " said Alec , " or they 'll hear me downstairs . " " Man ! " cried Tom , " they hear you all the way to the Bronx ! " " But I ca n't learn without practicing , can I ? " ALEC FINDS HIS VOICE 199 " Why , " asked Albert , " do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It comes through the walls there . " " It would come through Gibraltar ! " Tom assured him . " Why do n't you give it up ? " " It 's this way , " explained Alec , " I 'd like to make some money . " Tom pretended to feel in his pockets . " How much will buy you off ? " " Aw , I 'm serious ! I know what I 'm doing , and it 's hard enough without your butting in ! " Tired of bending their heads , they sat down on the floor . " Open that door wider for air , " advised Tom . Albert pushed it back with his foot . " You were saying ? " continued Tom . In disgust Alec picked up his saxophone and his book . " If you two are here for the night , I ca n't work ! " Tom caught him by a leg . " Get back to your trunk there and tell us what it 's about ! " " I want to learn the sax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like to earn my living , too . " " It 's a dog 's life , " said Albert sympathetically . " Wally 's been at it since he was born  --  learned the clarinet in Arizona , where there 's room . Now he 's up all night , five nights out of the seven , and he loves a dance the way a cook loves washing dishes . " 200 BACHELOR-OF ARTS ' Tom interrupted . " This desire for sudden wealth  --  has it anything to do with Mimi ? " " You may shut up ! " said Alec , with battle in his eye . Tom shrugged his shoulders . " Is it an insult if I imply you want to marry her ? Will you take it in the right spirit if I inquire further whether she has heard you play ? Much as women want wealth , some of them are squeamish about how it 's accu-mulated . " Albert feared an explosion . " Quit ragging him ! The way I look at it , he 's musical all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What is , then ? " asked Alec , deflated yet not hopeless . " I took the best part of this month 's allowance to pay the first instalment , but I dare say they 'd let me exchange it for whatever is right . " " Have you a voice ? " " Are you deaf ? " " I mean , can you sing ? " " Not alone , " Alec admitted , " but I usually join in . " You 're a born singer , " encouraged Albert , " and from the way you talk you might be a tenor . In that case , of course , you 'd be worth your weight in gold . " Alec was doubtful . " Does n't a voice have to be trained ? " ALEC FINDS HIS VOICE 20ITom cut in . " You lay your hands on your stomach , you draw in your chin , you shake your shoulders and say ah ! ' Advanced students say mee-mah-mee-mah ! ' but even then the neighbors like it better than saxophone practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw Tom downstairs . " Do n't mind him ! You join the glee club , and begin with the rehearsals and a concert or two in the suburbs , and as soon as you 're good enough , come out for the chapel choir  --  that pays your tuition , you know , it 's only a few minutes a day , and you get extra for a funeral . " Tom came back up the staircase . " The faculty 's old , but you should n't count on windfalls ! " Albert pushed him downstairs again , then turned once more to the perplexed sophomore . " Forget the sax ! Who wants to lug around a heavy thing like that , anyway ? A singer can just open his mouth , and there you are ! We 're rehearsing tomorrow night , under the chapel . " It was several weeks before he told Mimi about it . He intended to wait until he had actually sung money into his pocket , but the day he got the two letters from his parents and permission from the glee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt an urge to purchase shaving materials . Like an ordinary customer , he stood in line and put down his quarter , his soul in his eyes , being face202 BACHELOR-OF ARTSto face with her . She had been watching him from the moment he came in the door , but she kept her soul where it would n't show . " Why , hello , there ! " She pretended to be surprised . " I was just out of soap , " he explained . In the slow course of nature the other customers paid their bills and went their way . " I did n't know it , " he confided , " but I 'm a tenor . " She stared , smileless . " You mean you are now going to sing ? " " Sure ! " " Why ? " " Why would anybody sing ? " he countered , amazed . " Oh , I know why others would , " she answered pleasantly , " but I wondered what was your reason . " He made it clear . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the chapel choir . Then I can sing at faculty funerals . " She laughed so suddenly that the clerks across the store looked up . " Alec ! There never was any one like you ! " Since he declined to join in the laughter , she resumeda reasonable gravity . " You ought n't to sing unless your voice is trained . " " Do n't I know that ? " he asked triumphantly . ALEC FINDS HIS VOICE 203 " The best ones spoil easiest . That 's what I wrote my father . All I need is a few lessons from a good teacher , to start me off . Once I got the principles , I could do the rest myself . " " Did he send the money ? " asked Mimi , driving at the main point . Alec rubbed the back of his head . " He must have had an awful grouch that morning . He filled two pages saying things about an uncle of mine , not the one that left me the legacy , but a brother of Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father always had to pay his bills . The old man says he does n't believe I have a voice , but if I have , it explainsmy behavior . " " If you ca n't take lessons , " she persisted , " you ought n't to sing . " He was happy to correct her . " But Mother sent me fifty . She 's a dear ! She says she always hoped I 'd inherit her brother 's talent , and the lessons will do me good culturally . " Mimi 's eyes narrowed at him . " I 'd be interested to know what you spent the fifty for . " " Gosh , but you can be mean ! " She laughed . " It 's in the bank , every cent of it ! " he went on . " Five good lessons . The glee club leader told me of a first-rater who charges only ten . " Three customers interrupted . When they were gone , he spoke in a tone of still deeper confidence. 204 BACHELOR-OF ARTS " I wish I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tuck , of course , but for a concert you need tails . " She turned cool . " So you 've been buying a saxo-phone ! " " More or less , " he admitted . " It was a false start , before I knew about the voice . I suppose I could rent the coat . " " You can buy it , " she suggested sweetly . " You have your mother 's fifty . " He stared at her . " That would be a rotten trick ! " She stared back . " Would it ? Ca n't you treat her the way you 've treated me ? You bought a car . " He was n't angry , he was patient . " I 've made a mess of things , but I have n't wanted to be shabby . That money is for my singing lessons . " His gentleness for a moment made her forget to be severe . " Perhaps you can save enough for the coat before you have to give a concert . When do you begin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life returned . " Next week , girl  --  a try-out at Hackensack . How 's that for success ? A month ago I did n't even know I had a voice , and now the club is just leaning on me ! We 've only four first tenors , what you 'd call tenors , and one of them went diving in the tank and his sinuses could n't stand the chloride , so while he 's home snuffling , I get the center of the stage  --  one thirdALEC FINDS HIS VOICE 205of it , anyway . Next week , Thursday evening . " He leaned very close . " I say , Mimi , will you come hear me sing ? " She answered with surprising speed . " Yes , I 'm coming . " " Gosh , that 's great ! I 'll call for you at six-thirty . " She waited a second , to let her reply gather up its power . " Oh , but I 'm going with Wally Blake ! " He continued to lean on the desk , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand up . " I forgot you knew Wally . " " I know quite a number of people ! " " He 's busy most nights with his band , " reflected Alec hopefully , " he ca n't see you often . " " To me , " said Mimi , smiling , " it has n't seemed often . He does n't need your sympathy . He 's a good deal of a man . " Alec moved toward the door , as though walking in his sleep . " ' Wally 's all right , " he said , without looking at her . " I 'm glad you  --  glad youShe did not try to detain him . On her face , as she went back to her cash-counting , was the glow of victory . That night , after dinner at the fraternity house , Alec arranged to borrow the tail coat of Mitchell , the freshman . It was a new coat , and Mitchell had not yet had occasion to wear it , but he was still.206 BACHELOR  --  OF ARTSin the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his house spirit . Besides , it was known that he would spend that Thursday evening at a basket-ball game , where tails were not needed . His new coat dropped like ripe fruit into Alec 's hands . At peace then so far as that problem was concerned , Alec took his way at a late hour to his room in the dormitory , and in the corridor he found himselfshoulder to shoulder with Wally Blake , both stooping down and squinting into the mail boxes . Alec recognized the saxophone player first , and straightened up . Wally did n't have his instrument along with him . This had been one of his social evenings ! The tail coat ceased to give any satisfaction . " I say , Wally " Hello ! Did n't see who it was . " " No dance tonight ? " " Nope . Fussing . " Alec tried to keep an even and manly tone . " Coming to the concert Thursday ? " " That 's funny ! I just promised a girl to take her . " " Mimi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed back his hat and massaged his brow . " You had n't promised before this evening ? " " No . Why ? " ALEC FINDS HIS VOICE 207Alec nodded once or twice before springing his portentous disclosure . " She told me she was going with you  --  in the drugstore  --  this afternoon ! " Wally declined to be shocked . " Then she knew it first , that 's all . It frequently happens . When they 're fond of you , they lead you by the nose . " At that he went up the elevator , to his innocent night 's rest , leaving Alec as stationary as Lot 's wife , in front of the mail boxes . When they are fond of you ! From that moment until the Hackensack night he felt his way through a fog of jealousy and sentiment . He tracked Wally with shameless persistence , trying to estimate the duration and the intensity of moments possibly spent with Mimi . Shocked into unnatural tenderness by this cruel amputation of his romance , he wrote home pages of philosophical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sent his father one entire letter with no mention in it of money . He managed not to mention his jealousy to Mimi . He was , in fact , growing up . He could almost grasp the tragic fact that his courtship hitherto had lacked a practical vein . This musical career , now that he had got into it , seemed nebulous . The prospect of chapel choir and of funerals began to fade . He came to a magnanimous decision  --  he would postpone the singing lessons till after the208 BACHELOR-OF ARTSconcert , and then , unless his voice justified itself by some unmistakable triumph , he would return his mother 's fifty untouched . On the night of the concert he got into his white waistcoat and tie , accessories which could not gracefullybe rented or borrowed , and which therefore had shrunk the remains of his December allowance to one dollar and seventeen cents . The dollar he carried in his billfold , the change he dropped into his right trousers pocket . Thank heaven , there would be no expenses ! The club went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the refreshmentswould be furnished by the musical aristocratsof Hackensack , who would also complete the evening with a dance . Handling his small wealth , Alec recalled gloomily that he would be going home to Trenton for the holidays , and the family would expect Christmas gifts . One mother. , one father , two sisters , and a ticket to Trenton , all out of one dollar and seventeencents ! Well , he had other things to worry about . Perhaps there would be a windfall . He got into Mitchell 's coat , not a perfect fit , but near enough if he could keep it together in front . It had a tendency to deploy , leaving the waistcoat uncovered . He must remember to hold in his elbows as he sang . Over the tails he wore his summer coat , becauseALEC FINDS HIS VOICE 209it was black . His white muffler , he hoped , would protect his chest . The other fellows had opera hats , but now that he was trying to be a man of affairs , he did not consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his old soft thing looked adequate . Riding out on the bus , he found himself welcome , even popular . Albert was proud of the house , to produce a needed tenor at such short notice , and the other musical veterans were in a genial mood , the Hackensack audience being proverbially lenient . When they were waiting to go on the stage , humming lightly to tune up , Alec peeped through a tear in the curtain to find Mimi . There were hundreds of people . Perhaps , after all , she could n't come . Wally might be tooting away at some dance . He was glad he did n't have to see her  --  with Wally . The leader clapped his hands for silence . " Pay attention now , fellows ! We 're going on in a minute . That Marching Song first , you know !  --  Say , are you all fit to appear in public ? Everybody got his tie on straight and his clothes buttoned ?  --  Now remember , tenors , when you come in at that high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the fourth page where you have the A flat  --  well , for God 's sake , do n't come in too soon ! It is n't a solo . Wait for the other parts ! Or you might2I0 BACHELOR-OF ARTSwatch me , for a change . You ca n't miss it if you watch ; I 'll give you a good beat . Everybody on , now ! Step on it ! " Once out in their place , the glee club formed in a graceful half-moon , with the leader , a lone star , well in front , midway between the tips , Alec being one of the tips . He felt much exposed . Mitchell 's coat , in this crisis , insisted on bulging . Alec grasped the sides firmly and held himself together . The stage seemed unnaturally high . Far below , a large and benevolent audience were smiling up , ready to be pleased . Again Alec tried to find Mimi , but there was n't time to examine all the rows . The leader had his arms out and was framing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep breath . They began well enough , but just before they got to " strong men of yore , " Alec discovered Mimi in the thirteenth row , beside Wally Blake . His jaw dropped , and he forgot to sing . Wally was leaning back in patronizing comfort , with a grin on his face and his right arm over the back of Mimi 's chair . She wore a look of friendly concern , as though she hoped against hope that the Marching Song would come to a good end . Alec forgot where he was . His thought was riveted on a neat plan to separate her from that saxophone player as soon as the concert was over . The leader , missing one of his too few tenors , ALEC FINDS HIS VOICE 2IImade desperate signals to Alec to come on in again . When the signals registered at last , Alec , abruptly roused , thought they summoned him to the A flat on the fourth page . " Strong " he shouted , then collapsed , finding his contribution inappropriate . Though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , and he could see Mimi laughingalmost as loud as Wally . For a moment she covered her eyes with her hand , but her shoulders shook , and when she took her hand down , she caught his gaze and laughed right out . He could not have imagined , that night or the days after , a more tragic collapse of his world . His sophomore year , nearly half gone , had produced only a laborious football season , without glory , and a ridiculous debut in the fine arts . He had given Mimi nothing to be proud of , but too specifically something to laugh at . These months had been wasted . Of course he had studied hard , the marks were pretty good , and Barth 's course kept you thinking , but how could a small profit like that offset the losses ? When he went home for the Christmas holidays , Mimi packed up for St. Louis . For her sake he was glad she could see her folks , but he was a little surprised . Last year she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a substitute at the drugstore . " He was seeing her off on the train. 2I2 BACHELOR-OF ARTS " She 's a better cashier than I 'll ever make . " " But you 're coming back , of course ! " " I certainly am ! " " They keep the job for you ? " " If they do n't , I 'll get another . " He wondered at her confidence , but at the time thought no more about it . His mother and his sisters were waiting at the station for him , and never had he returned to a more Christmas-like atmosphere in the old house on Atterbury Avenue . After his hectic autumn , this mingling of home and holiday comforted his soul . He caught himself looking at his tall mother , with her gray hair . He had not always noticed how handsome she was . Almost as stout as Mrs. Illings , but still a grand figure , and none of those idiotic eye glasses . She had the art of enjoying life . She was , Alec considered , younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when she inquired into the details of his football glory , he brought himself to tell also the truth about the Hackensack concert . " That explains , " she laughed , " why I got my fifty dollars back ! It was so unnatural , I feared for your health . " " No singing for me ! " said Alec firmly . " I 'm through . " His sister Laura stood up for his talents . SheALEC FINDS HIS VOICE 2I3was a younger edition of their mother , oval-faced , gray-eyed , black-haired . That very deep black which turns early to white . " You have a lovely voice ! " she said . " All it needs is training . How could you expect to sing without a mistake the first time ? You 'd better recover that fifty , and take some lessons . " Alec shook his head . " Dad 's right . Musicians are queer . I wo n't be one . There 's a fellow at collegenow , earns his way playing the sax at dances . " Beatrice interrupted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inherited their father 's wavy hair , hers being brown . She was the only member of the family who was n't tall , but she made up for shortness by energy . " I 'd like a boy who had that kind of spunk ! I think I 'd like to marry a saxophone player . " " All right ! " said her brother cheerfully . " We 'll arrange it ! He makes oodles of money , his dispositionat the moment is toward matrimony , and you 'd always know where he was evenings . " Alec 's father listened without attending to the jokes . His long , rather massive face was thoughtful , not to say sad . That 's the way he had . been in the summer , when Alec had worried about his health , but this was the first moment those symptomsdisturbed the Christmas serenity . A tall , powerful man , accustomed to make decisions and2I4 BACHELOR-OF ARTSgive orders , but now gentle , a little wistful . Somethingclutched at Alec 's heart . He 'd miss the old boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " asked Mr. Hamilton , " he earns his living playing the saxophone ? " " Runs a whole orchestra . " " Are many boys earning their living in college now ? " " A lot . " " How do they do it ? " Alec was vague . None of his friends came from the laboring class . " Oh , they wait on tables for their meals , the grinds do tutoring , some know shorthand and work for the profs . I heard of one fellow who takes children out to the park every afternoon  --  a male nursemaid . You can get a job in shoe shops , Saturday nights . " Beatrice was interested . " Why Saturdays ? " " Do n't you know ? That 's the night , my dear child , when people buy their shoes . At least , in Harlem . Mondays and Tuesdays they do n't need salesmen . " " When I was in college , " said Mr. Hamilton , " we had no such opportunities . Of course we did n't look for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but attend his classes , and perhaps play the banjo " " Or poker , " said Beatrice , looking up . " Do n't tell me , Dad , you learned poker in your later years ! " ALEC FINDS HIS VOICE 215No holidays ever passed more quickly for Alec than this Christmas week . His parents and his sisters conspired to make him feel grateful for his home . On his meager Christmas gifts they spent a quite disproportionate ecstasy of appreciation . Their gifts to him were generous  --  perhaps simpler than in other years , but still handsome . They made much of the tree trimming , and at the Christmas dinner his parents , Alec noted , were in a reminiscent mood , recalling childhood incidents , recreating long-past hours of their household . And on Christmas day he had a telegram from St. Louis. teI AM VERY HAPPY . THE NEW YEAR WILL BE WONDERFUL . I LOVE NO ONE BUT YOU . " ( Unsigned ) What more could a man ask for ? The night after Christmas , when they had finished with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library before the open fire . The conversation died in a contented silence . Mr. Hamilton cleared his throat , Alec , looking at him , saw him sit up straight , rub his hands nervously , then lean forward a little , grasping the arms of the chair . " I 've something to tell you children which I postponed until after Christmas day . Your mother216 BACHELOR-OF ARTSand I have known it for sometime , but we wished not to spoil your holiday with our worries . " It sounded ominous . Alec and his sisters watched the lines come in the large man 's face , patterns of agony . " These are bad times , as you must know . Businessis  --  well , there is no business . I 've been trying to keep the f oundry going by drawing on my private resources . Now I have nothing more . " He looked into their eyes , forcing a brave smile . " I hope to save this home of ours  --  perhaps I ca n't  --  but we shall be very short of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we 're sorry for you children . " Alec walked over and slapped him on the back . " Not for me , Dad ! I ought to have got to work long ago ! " His father looked up at him . " I want you to go on with your education , but from now on you 'll have to earn your way . " o , IX1,1The Right To WorkCOMING back from Trenton , after the Christmas holidays , he went first to the University EmploymentOffice , in Earl Hall . His intention was to secure a job before he faced Mimi . When he told her his father 's money was gone , and he must naw earn his way through college , she would ask , naturally , how he expected to do it , and he wanted to have an answer . The dormitory room must be abandoned , unless the University had some merciful way of dealing with the students like himself , unexpectedly perplexed . He could n't pay the rent in advance . He had with him a check for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and providential savings  --  and fifteen dollars in cash , just enough to feed him for two weeks . His mother would have given more , but he felt unmanly to accept even this . Of course he might have given up his studies altogether , but his father had challenged him . " My misfortune may prove the best part of your218 BACHELOR-OF ARTSeducation , son . Other boys make their way , why not you ? " So here he was in Earl Hall , fresh from ' the train , . ready to make his way . The Employment Bureau was across the hall . from the renting office . He would take a job first , and then get rid of his room . But ten or twelve boys were already consulting the employment clerk , who did not conceal the fact that he was harassed . " I do n't think we can promise you anything , Mr. Hamilton . Every one 's looking for work . There 's an occasional call for advanced tutoring , especially in mathematics . " Alec shook his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he added . " I could n't teach . " " What would you like to do ? " " I can drive a car  --  oh , I know , I could teach swimming  --  I 'm not so bad at tennis  --  I 'm a pretty good dancer " The clerk was neither amused nor impressed . Undergraduate accomplishments are fairly uniform . " If anything promising comes up , I 'll let you know . You 're in the dormitories ? " Alec hesitated . " I 'll give you my address later .
