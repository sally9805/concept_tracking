DEATH IN DUBLIN-Frank O'Connor-Doubleday , Doran ( $2.50 ) . <P> " Ireland , " James Joyce once remarked , citing the great Irishmen who have perished at the hands of their own countrymen , " is the old sow that eats her farrow . " But Ireland also has a great tradition of keening her dead , and most gifted young Irish writers ( Sean O'Faolain , Liam O'Flaherty , Frank O'Connor et al ) , in dealing with " The Trouble " of 1916-21 , have let it appear that most Irishmen feel as fiercely involved with the heroes of this period as any generation that ever cursed or caressed the names of O'Neill , Robert Emmet , Wolfe Tone , Parnell . Frank O'Connor 's Death in Dublin , a biography of the latest great Irish patriot , Michael Collins , contains this challenging statement : " A new generation has grown up which is utterly indifferent to the great story that began in Easter 1916 . It is even bored by it . ... They do n't drink , they do n't swear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another with the exquisite politeness of Chinese mandarins . . . . " The career of Michael Collins , as Author O'Connor relates it in fighting style , should make such Irish softies take shame to themselves . <P> A London exile for ten years , handsome , boxer-built Michael Collins was 26 when he returned to Dublin to join up for the Easter Rebellion . Typical of that reckless , crudely organized revolt was the instance when one of its leaders , on the eve of the Rebellion , related hilariously to the Military Council how he had just kidded a friend into thinking " there was going to be a rising tomorrow . " Replied one member of the unamused , better-informed High Command : " Almighty God , ' t is tomorrow ' t is going to be . " Mick Collins , not a leader of the rising ( all of them were executed except Eamon de Valera ) , only went to prison for nine months . For his distinguished prison record in underground organization , he was put in command of the Sinn Fein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Big Fellow . " When in 1918 Lloyd George sent over Sir John French to take Ireland in hand , Collins escaped the wholesale arrests ( the first escape in a series that became legendary ) , settled down in earnest for a finish fight . His perspective included such hotheaded schemes as stealing the Stone of Scone from the Coronation Chair in Westminster Abbey , assassinating the entire British Cabinet , kidnapping President Wilson to get his undivided attention to the case for Irish freedom .
