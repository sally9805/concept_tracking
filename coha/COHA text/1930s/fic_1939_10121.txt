" Look in the back of my car , " I said , " and get me a screwdriver and a hammer and meet me by the front door . " " But you might make it worse , Mr. Calder , " Josie said . I did not answer . I already had a premonition that I wouldmake it worse . Outside , the heat from a blue summer sky had been partially absorbed by the elms and the shrubbery , but the shade did not alleviate this heat ; it simply changed its quality into a heavy greenishwarmth of vegetable exhalation . The robins were chirping drowsily in the trees and the echo of the lawn mower still seemed to linger in that warm vacancy . Earle appeared with the hammer and the screw driver , and it came over me that none of us had been taught to use our hands at Wickford Point . None of us were good at driving nails and we were rather proud of it . " It 's hot , ai n't it ? " Earle said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , what 's the matter with this door ? " " It just do n't open , " Earle said . " It seems like it 's sort of sagged down . " The paint was peeling from the panels of the heavy front door . Trumpet vines were twined over it , and bees were buzzing dully . I lifted the latch and pushed against it , but it did not move . I examined the heavy hand-beaten hinges which were deeply encrusted with paint . It seemed necessary to get the door off the hinges , but there seemed no proper way to do it , and no way to begin . " Something must have give somewhere , do n't you think ? " Earle said . I jammed the screw driver tentatively at the paint above the hinges . " Those ai n't screwed on , " Earle said . " It looks like they 're riveted . A screw driver wo n't do any good , Mr. Calder . " I threw my weight against the door and it gave. 6o " There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Something 's stuck in it . " And I was right . I walked through the side door and into the front entry . There was a mass of paper wedged into the jamb near the threshold . By working the door back and forth , Earle and I scraped the paper out , and then the door opened and shut easily enough . " Funny someone should n't have noticed that , " said Earle . " Looks like a letter , do n't it ? Someone must have dropped it . " " You can put the tools back in my car now , " I said . When Earle went away I stood in the entry smoothing the paper in my hand . It had been crushed so that it was almost indecipherable . Judging from the few words I could read , it had belonged to Bella , and Bella appeared just as I was reading it . She was dressed in slacks , a striped jersey , and sandals , and she was yawning . She had not bothered to brush her short black hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sleepy . " What are you doing , darling ? " Bella said . " I 've been fixing the door , " I said . " One of your letters got jammed in it . " " What letter ? " Bella asked . " It looks like a letter from your friend Berg , " I said . " You can give it to me , " said Bella , and she snatched it out of my hand . " Every time you walk across the room you drop something , " I said . " If it is n't a letter it 's a compact , and if it is n't a compact it 's a dollar bill , and if it is n't a dollar bill it 's a ring . " " I 'm looking for a cigarette , " said Bella . " Have n't you a cig-arette ? " " No , " I said , " I gave them to your mother . " " She 's finished them all , " said Bella .

I 'd have looked through yours , but you always get up too early . Somebody 's got to go down to the bank . Are you going downtown ? " " I do n't know what I 'm going to do , " I said , " but anyway I fixed the door . " " I suppose you 're going to do something , " said Bella . " You always do something . I suppose you 're going to read . I 've got to get away from this , darling . It 's getting on my nerves . Are you going away anywhere ?

" What makes you think I 'm going anywhere ? " I asked . " Your bag was out in your room , " Bella said . " The door was open and I saw it when I came downstairs . " " Well , " I said , " I 'm going to New York tonight . " " Why , darling , " said Bella , " why should you be going to New York ? " " Business , " I said . " George Stanhope wants to see me about that story I 'm finishing . They want some changes . " " Oh , " said Bella , " is that all ? " " Yes , " I said , " of course that 's all .

" I would n't like to have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bee  --  " I began , but I did not have a chance to finish . The telephone in the small parlor rang . Bella 's face brightened . That sound from an outer world seemed to go through her like a healing electric shock . Small bright lights appeared in her violet eyes . The lazy droop left her lips . The ring of the telephonemade her alert and charming . She was Bella Brill again , that amusing gay girl who was different , one of those remarkable62talented Brills . She was the Bella Brill who could be the life of the party . Her sandals clattered as she darted out into the entry . " I 'll answer it , " she said . I myself could feel the stimulating effect of that ugly tinkling bell . It was not ringing with the mechanical pulse beats of a city telephone but with the long vicious rings translated by the frustrated finger of some girl at the local switchboard . It was a summons from the saner , outer world that was too busy to permit the overdevelopment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wickford Point  --  the world which had exploitedme in the journalistic trade , the world which had pushed me into France and had blown me out of the front-line trenches and had rubbed my nose in London , Paris and Berlin , and in Beirut and Peking . The same world was calling which had nearly cleaned me out in the crash of ' 29 and which was now taxing my earnings to give me a more abundant life . Everything you learned in it turned out to be wrong . It was as baffling and as fascinating as when I had seen it first . Bella , skipping to the telephone , was arranging her exterior to meet it . She was now the intellectual , epigrammatic Bella Brill , the granddaughter of old John Brill , the homespun sage and poet of transcendentalist New England . I myself was changing , because the call might be for me . I was casting aside the minutiae of Wickford Point ; I was becoming Jim Calder , who knew his way around . . . . It was an out-of-town call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be my agent in New York to converse about that story . It might be someone else asking me somewhere . The wooden shutters of the small parlor were still drawn , making the small square room brown and dusky . I had an impression of the whatnot in the corner with the sea shells on it , of the braided rug on the green pine floor , of my great-grandfather 's portrait , and of my great-grandmother 's portrait over the coal63grate , and of the Hogarth print which someone had found in the attic , and of the water color of the river which Cousin Clothilde'smother had done after she came back from Brook Farm , and of the broken Chippendale chair , and of the whole one . I was aware of all these things without really seeing them , just as I was sometimes aware of their presence in the dark . Bella was picking the telephone off the little table and was slouching down into the nearest Windsor chair . " Hello , " Bella was saying , " hello . " Her voice was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a gay and provocative invitation ; it told of a girl who was expecting something nice and was ready to try anything once . It was the voice which had taken away at least two of her sister Mary 's boy friends . " Hello , " Bella said , and then something made her tone grow hard and her thin shoulders stiffen beneath her striped jersey . " What are you doing ? What do you want ? Excuse me . " She was being elaborately polite . " But I do sometimes answer the telephone . It 's my house as much as his . Yes , he 's right here in the room . For heaven 's sake stop being formal ! " Bella set down the receiver and got out of the Windsor chair . Her lips were drawn into a thin grimace which was more of a grin than a smile . Those bony shoulders of hers , her whole delicate body , were stiff and taut . " It 's Joe , " she said . " He wants to speak to you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's what you get for running to the telephone . " The grimace about Bella 's lips changed to a Mona Lisa smile , an expression with which I was familiar . It was a look of hauteur . She was no longer a play girl , but an aristocrat . " You might tell Joe that he need n't call up here , " she said . " There 's such a thing as a sense of decency , when people are divorced . " " He did n't want you , " I said , " he wanted me. " 64 " Oh , " said Bella , " you think so , do you ? You might at least be loyal to your own family . " " Go out and get your coffee , " I said . " He can call me up any time he wants . " " It 's what I might expect from you , " said Bella , " and you 're not such a saint either . I know plenty about you . How would you like it if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bella laughed , a thin , provoking laugh . " Everybody knows , " she began , and stopped . I turned away toward the telephone and I could hear her running out of the room . I could hear her footsteps on the stairs in cautious haste . Bella would be going to the extension in the upper hall . " Hello , " I said , " hello , Joe . " Joe 's voice was loud and amused . " Hello , Jim , " said Joe . " What the hell are you doing in that lunatic asylum ? Are you in the psychopathic ward ? " I was pleased with his question because Bella was undoubtedly listening by that time . In fact I had already heard the receiver being gently lifted off the hook . " I 'm taking a rest , " I said . " Oh , " said Joe . " Just sitting on your fanny , thinking ? Is Sid there ? Is he thinking too ? You have n't any right to think . You 're not a Brill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not be so bitter , but I did not blame him much . " Where are you , Joe ? " I asked . I hoped he was n't far away . It did me good , as it always did , to hear his voice . He said he was in Boston on his way to Vermont . He was going to speak at the Hilsop Literary Conference . He did n't know why he was going but his publishers had fixed it . Sam Maxwell had asked him as a personal favor . Sam was in charge of part of the program . Everything was going fine . They had sold a hundred and fifty thousand copies of his new novel , not counting the Book-65of-the-Month Club . He could n't very well go back on Sam . It was hot as hell in Boston and he was stopping at the Crofton . Sam was paying the expenses . They had given him a room full of fake Italian furniture with a Renaissance fireplace that looked like a funnel . He had been on the wagon for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why did n't I come down and we could have dinner ? I told him that I would . Then he asked how Bella was , and I told him she was fine and something made him laugh . When I set down the telephone I had a feeling that I had been away , although I could not define where I had been , but at any rate it was a long way from Wickford Point . Joe had never understood the place , or if he had he was not tied up with it . He was as sensitive as I was , probably more sensitive , but there were no cobwebs of the past about him . By the time I had walked from the parlor to the dining room , Sid had come down to breakfast . He was sitting hunched over the table in his shirt sleeves , stirring his coffee very carefully , watching the eddies that followed his spoon . Occasionally he would lift it up and allow drops to fall from it very gradually , one by one , back into the cup . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise which he had contrived to test the steadiness of his hand . He had prided himself on his manual dexterity from the time he had decided to be a chemist , some years before , and now he was in the land of make-believe , thinking of someone like Alexis Carrel . He had not yet tied his necktie and the two ends dangled dreamily over the front of his white shirt . " Good morning , Jim , " said Sid . His voice was resonant , almost pontifical , a mannerism which he had developed lately . " Have you ever noticed the varying surface tension of coffee ? " It made an erudite and interesting remark . Sid was always interesting . " Did you ever think , " said Sid , " that it would he quite possible to tell whether coffee is properly boiled or not simply by watch-66ing it drip from a spoon ? It would not be necessary to taste it . I think this coffee has been boiled too long . " " It 's been on the back of the stove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can tell it , " agreed Sid , " by watching it drop from the spoon . " I sat down . That Confucian contemplation of Sid 's was a partof Wickford Point , where almost any motion became significant . " How 's your stomach ? " I asked . Sid 's face brightened . " I lay in the sun on the beach all day yesterday , " he said . " As long as I am perfectly still in the sun there does n't seem to be any gas . It 's only when I try to do some work . " " What are you working on ? " I asked . " I 'm trying to gauge weights by touch , " Sid said . " I 've been trying for the last two weeks , picking up small objects and then checking my guess . I borrowed some of your socks this morning . Josie has n't got around to the washing . Where 's Bella ? " " Upstairs , " I said . " Joe called up . " " He did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " He wanted me to have dinner with him at the Crofton . Bella went upstairs to listen on the extension . " Sid bent over his coffee spoon and uttered a single monosyllable . " Bitch , " he said , and then the dining-room door opened . Bella was with us again . " What 's that you said ? " asked Bella . " Never mind , " said Sid . Bella sat down and put her elbows on the table and cupped her chin in the palms of her nervous hands . " You called me a bitch , " she said . " Jim 's the only one on this place who can call me that . " As she turned toward me there was an almost affectionate look in her narrow , violet eyes . " And now , " said Bella , " I 'm about through with this . I 've sat around long enough seeing you dribble coffee , Sid , and hearing about your bellyaches . You think you 're a genius , do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too damned lazy to move . What did67you do with that ten dollars you borrowed from Mary ? " Sid shrugged his shoulders slightly and looked up from his coffee cup . " Oh hell , " said Bella , " what 's the use ? I 'm going to get out of here . I 'm going to spend the night at the Jaeckels ' . Jim 's driving into Boston . You 'll drop me off , wo n't you , darling ? " " Yes , " I said , " I 'll drop you off . " " In the ocean , " said Sid , " with a stone around your neck . " Bella looked at Sid and looked away . " Darling , " she said to me , " Clothilde wants to see you upstairs . " She patted my hand gently . I knew why she called me " darling , " because she wanted a ride halfway to town , and then there was probably something about Joe . She would want to ask me all about him . A hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I followed the direction of those violet eyes , which could change as rapidly as the surface of a hurrying brook . Bella was looking back toward her brother . Sid was holding a folded ten-dollar bill between his first and second fingers . " So you 've still got Mary 's ten dollars , " Bella said . " It was n't in your trousers this morning . " " You have a small mind , " said Sid . " If you 're going to the Jaeckels ' you 'll need to tip the servants . Take it . " Bella 's face softened . " Thanks , " she said , " ever so much , Sid darling . Do n't you want me to get you some toast ? Do n't you want anything besides coffee ? " Then the telephone rang again . " I 'll go , " said Bella , and she skipped away like a dancer  --  and she was a pretty dancer . " Waiting for someone to call her up , is n't she ? " said Sid . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I was not her darling any longer . " That 's for you , " Bella said . " Why ca n't you take your own 68telephone calls ? I have to spend all my time here doing things for everybody . " " Who is it ? " I asked her . " For God 's sake , " said Bella , " do you think I 'm your private secretary ? I do n't know who he is . He 's got a pansy voice . " At first I could not imagine who it was , and then I knew that it was Allen Southby calling . His voice was crisp and businesslike , indicating that he was having a busy morning . " Jim , " he said , " I want to see you . " " That 's fine , " I said . " I 'd like to see you , Allen . " " I mean right away , " said Allen , " I mean tonight . I 'm in a sort of jam . " His gay laugh , when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a jam , that he was simply playfully using the vernacular . " I mean , " said Allen , " a purely literary jam . " " Oh , " I said , " you could n't be , Allen . " " It 's about that novel , Jim , " he said . " It 's just that I 've come to a point in it where I need someone who can listen . How does it happen that you 've been holding out on me ? " " What are you talking about ? " I asked . Allen 's answer was playful and very , very friendly , just the gentle chiding of a dear old friend who knows that his own dear old friend is sometimes up to games . " You never told me , " Allen said , " that you had any important New England connection until the other evening . Can you come down tonight ? " There was an annoying , breezy implication in his question . He was saying that he knew that I would be flattered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in the throes of composition , that what he was doing was a matter of such vital importance that anybody would drop anything to be present at the birth of his ideas . " I ca n't very well , " I said . " I 'm seeing Joe Stowe tonight . " " Joe Stowe ! " Allen called back . " Why did n't he let me know69he was here , I wonder . He always lets me know . Why , I could have put him up for the night . Where 's he stopping ? You just leave it to me , I 'll get in touch with Joe . " Of all the arts I suppose that writing is the one which develops the lowest attributes , in that its very pursuit magnifies all the human failings . It encourages introversion , neurasthenia , insomnia , irritability and all forms of self-indulgence . It encourages a sensitiveness which makes one open to any sort of slight . It begets a type of personal inflation , for it is nearly impossible to continue without the consciousness of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is misunderstood by editors , perhaps because one is too far advanced to be comprehended by the simple moron mind . It may be that this hidden gift still lies fallow , but there must be an inner conviction of its presence . It is what enables an author to walk airily among his colleagues and to dispense and to receive the bitter little condescensions of the trade . There is a jealousy in the writing profession which is peculiarly its own . Although I knew that I was jealous , I did not like to think that Allen Southby could get under my skin , because , of course , I knew in my own mind that he was my intellectual inferior . I wished to view him with detachment and the fact that he always succeeded in shaking that detachment was peculiarly unsettling . " Who was it ? " Bella asked . " Allen Southby , " I said . " You do n't know him . " " He wrote a book , did n't he ? " " Yes , " I said , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Bella , " it was recommended in the Junior League Magazine . Is he attractive ?

" " What good does it do to try to find out something about everybody ? " I asked her . " It only gets you into mischief . Never mind about Southby. " 70Bella smiled . A dimple deepened in her left cheek and her eyes grew innocently wide . " You just do n't want me to meet him , because you know I 'd like him , " she said , " and he must have written a really good book because you 're jealous . I 'm going to read it . Clothilde wants to see you . I 'll get Frieda to wash some stockings for me and press some things . Let me know when you 're starting out . " 71VIIAge Can not Wither Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long room which overlooked the river . From her window you could see where the channel curved past the point with its white pines , and you could see the white houses far across on the opposite bank . The river had a deep rich hue under the clear sky , and the spar buoys were bent upstream by the incoming tide . Cousin Clothilde was sitting up in a maple field-bed decorated by ancient , moth-eaten curtains . The room had been swept out and all the little odds and ends had been removed from the bureau and mantel , so that it looked white and bare and cool . It was almost like one of those rooms with a cord across the doorway which you might see in an old house opened to the public . It was like the room where Lafayette had slept or Washington 's mother had died , and the furniture might have been contributed later by the Colonial Dames of America  --  not very good furniture , just odds and ends so that the room would not look entirely empty . Cousin Clothilde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blackened pier glass . There were a number of cigarette butts in the fireplace , three ginger ale bottles and some glasses on the hearth , and Cousin Clothilde was in a purple kimono which Bella 's friend , Mr. Berg , had given her  --  it was not in good taste , as a gift or as a kimono . " Darling , " said Cousin Clothilde , " have you a cigarette ? " " I gave you all mine last night , " I said . Cousin Clothilde sighed . " Everybody always takes my cigarettes , " she said . " I do n't know why none of my children can take the responsibility of having72some in the house . Look in my upper bureau drawer , there may be some in there . " Cousin Clothilde 's upper bureau drawer was mostly filled with stockings which did not match . There were also two broken Navajo brooches , one of my great-aunt Sarah 's knitting needles , a yellow piece of Chinese ivory , a half-empty bottle of nail polish and a depilatory preparation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be some there , " said Cousin Clothilde . " I wonder if that girl of Josie 's steals things . She might have stolen them . " This was the simplest explanation when articles were mislaid at Wickford Point , from the days of Aunt Sarah onward . WickfordPoint always seemed to be surrounded by marauders and petty pilferers , obsessed by a particular desire to abscond with tooth paste , bits of soap and other toilet articles , or thimbles , needles and thread . Aunt Sarah also used to blame disappearances on the crows , for she had known a tame crow once that was alwaystaking spoons out of the kitchen and hiding them under the shingles of the woodshed roof . " Frieda is getting above herself , " Cousin Clothilde said . " Bella lets her get too familiar . They 're in the laundry too much togetherpressing clothes .

That little Herman came naked into the parlor yesterday . It was all right because it amused Sid , and yesterday the cat had kittens in the china cupboard . I suppose we shall have to drown them , but I want to keep them73long enough so we can see them frisk about . Sid loves kittens . The front door is stuck .

I thought Mr. Berg was charming . He 's in business , you know . " Cousin Clothilde sighed . " It 's nice that Bella is getting interested in a business man for a change . What we need is some money in the family and a little peasant blood . " " How can he be hanging around here for a week , " I asked , " if he has any business ?

" Once I made a water-color sketch of the river from here , " she said . " What are you getting up for ? Do sit down and do n't fidget . There are so many things I want to talk to you about , darling . Bella does n't whistle to people . It is n't fair to say that about Bella. " 74 " Then she shakes herself , " I said .

I never can remember to go to that place where you have to read something out loud . I know he will look out for me . I can see it from his face . " " He 'll look out for you , " I said . " Well , " said Cousin Clothilde , " someone has to . I 'm just about tired of looking out for everybody .

The Willoughbys know someone who knows Edsel Ford , and they think that Edsel Ford may want a mural . " " How do they know he wants a mural ? " I asked . " People like that , " said Cousin Clothilde , " always want murals . You only have to make them feel they want them .

" It probably is saving him a good deal , because he has n't asked me for any money , and Mirabel Steiner loves it here , and she is so interested77in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said she would like to analyze you . " " Now look here , " I said , " I told you  --  " " Darling , " said Cousin Clothilde , " she wo n't be here long . Harry will have to get back . He 's very busy about something . And besides he 's going to Easthampton next week end . You wo n't really have to talk to Mirabel . You can just sort of keep going away . " Cousin Clothilde held the letter at arm 's length and squinted at it . " I had n't seen this part , " she added . " His bridgework has broken down . " " What bridgework ? " I asked . " Harry 's bridgework , " said Cousin Clothilde . " Do n't you rememberwhen he did that dance on the Yacht Club float at the Mayhews ' costume party ? He was dressed as a Greek in one of those ballet dresses . He slipped and loosened three front teeth , and now his bridgework has broken down . Ile went to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to like so much . Dr. Jess had to take every bit of his inlay out of my mouth . I do n't see why you do n't go to Dr. Jess , darling . His specialty is massaging gums . " A bit of summer breeze came through the open window , hot and moist and redolent with the smell of fresh cut grass . It was like a breath of sanity , for I was being involved in the intricacies of Wickford Point again , where every small thing was of importance and where the mind wandered languidly to this and that with a strange midsummer 's madness . We had touched on nearly all the family and now we had come to the dentists . The Brills all had trouble with their teeth . They were rather proud of it because it was a family trait . " I should n't worry about Dr. Jess , " I said . Cousin Clothilde folded her letter . " The only point is that Harry 's bridgework will have to be fixed . It 's going to cost over two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other people too . I hope they do  --  the girls will like it . " " Well , " I said , " I 'd better be going . " " Why do you have to be going ? " said Cousin Clothilde . " I have n't even begun to talk to you . You 're always running away somewhere . Did n't I hear the telephone ringing this morning ? I suppose it was for Bella . " " That was for me , " I said . " Joe Stowe rang me up  --  from Boston . " The delicate arch of Cousin Clothilde 's eyebrows moved . " Does Bella know it ? " she asked . I nodded and the room was still for a minute , so still that I could hear a church bell ringing across the river . " She 's going over to the Jaeckels ' , " I said . " I 'm going to see Joe . He 's in Boston at the Crofton . " Cousin Clothilde was motionless . She was looking at me hard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes were beautiful , the same violet as Bella 's but lighter , softer . I knew what Hugh Brill had seen in them when he first rowed over from the Brill place , now a national shrine , across the river . I knew what Archie Wright had seen in them . He had tried to paint them often enough . I knew what Manet had seen in them at the time she had known him in Paris . " Give Joe my love , " she said . " It might have worked , " I told her , " if you had n't  --  " I paused because there was no use going into details which she had never understood . " Darling , " said Cousin Clothilde , " I did n't do anything . I know you loved him , but it was all a mistake . It was the war and this and that . Give Joe my love . I wonder why it is I have so many white spots on my fingernails . There must be something wrong with my circulation . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She put her hand on mine so that I could see her fingers , and then again her thoughts drifted away and she began to laugh . " What 's the matter ? " I asked 79 " I was thinking about their wedding , " she said . " Darling , do you remember how Archie got tangled up with the cat and fell down the entry stairs , right into that strange Negro who came from the bootlegger , the one who was carrying the tray of champagne ? " " Yes , " I said , and I laughed too . I nearly always laughed when she did . " And I remember how the tailor burned the back of Harry 's trousers when he took them off to have them pressed . He was having it done in the shop right near the church down- town . Do you remember that ? " " Yes , " said Cousin Clothilde , " so he could n't go at all . He had to borrow a raincoat . I wonder if he ever returned it . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , ringing across the river . The sound made me think that nothing which had ever happened at Wick ford Point ever en- tirely left it , and that parts of everything which had happened were always waiting  --  ready to move forward out of nowhere when they were least expected . I was sitting on the edge of Cousin Clothilde 's bed but the bell had brought my thoughts away to the abstractions of marriage and divorce . I was thinking that one could never tell in advance , no matter with what experience , whether any two individuals would achieve a successful or an unsuccessful marriage . There was too much hidden in every char- acter , too many doubts , too many hesitations . Then , while I was still thinking , Bella Brill 's voice came to me out of the air around me , full of all those hesitations and those doubts . I was back for just a moment to the morning of that wedding day , suffering from the ghost of an old headache . I remembered how Bella had come into my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep , for the first sounds that I had heard were thumping noises in the rooms below me , made by Mr. Morrissey arranging furniture for the wedding breakfast . When I opened my eyes my head began to ache and I saw Bella standing looking at me , wrapped in the Chinese robe which I 8o had given her . It had been a good many years ago , but I could remember exactly how she looked then  --  dark-eyed and pale , half-frightened and half-elated . " Jim , " she said , " you 've got to get up . Where were you last night ? " " Downtown at the hotel with Joe , " I said . " I 've got a headache , but do n't worry about Joe . He 'll be all right . " " I do n't see why Joe should drink so much , " Bella said , " just the night before he 's getting married . " " It 's just a custom , " I told her . " The whole thing is custom . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Bella said . " You have to get dressed right away , darling , and do something . " " Do what ? " I asked . " Everything , " said Bella , " and I ca n't stand it if you ask me questions . They 've all begun to come . " " Who ? " I asked . " Cousin Harriet 's just come in a taxi from the station , " Bella said , " and that bootlegger that Harry found is downstairs waiting for a check . And Archie wo n't get off the sofa . " My head ached worse when I sat up . " What sofa ? " I asked . " Down in the parlor , " Bella said . " He went to sleep there last night . He wo n't get up and Cousin Harriet does n't understand it , and Sid is still asleep and Josie has n't finished with my dress . " I reached for my dressing gown . " What time is it ? " I asked . " Darling , " said Bella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to be married downtown at twelve , and do you know what they 're asking ? They 're asking if I 'm sure I want to marry him . " " Well , why are n't you dressed ? " I asked . Bella raised her clenched hands in a hopeless gesture . " How can I get dressed if they have n't got my dress ready ? " she 8rcried . " And how can I tell if Joe 's ready ? How can I tell any-thing ? " " It 's all right , " I said . " You 've got plenty of time . You do want to marry him , do n't you ? " Bella raised her hands again . " How many times , " she asked , " do I have to say I do ? Of course I want to marry him . I want to do anything to get out of here . Jim darling , everyone is downstairs . " " All right , " I said , " all right . " " Jim ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I 've come to say good-by . " " Now do n't be silly , Belle , " I said . " You 're not saying good-by to me at all . " " Well , " said Bella , " it just seems that way . Everybody 's making such a damn fuss . " " Do n't worry , Belle , " I said . " It 's going to be all right . You could n't find anyone better than Joe . " " Miss Bella , " Josie was calling from the hall , " your dress is all ironed now , and it 's just the dearest dress , and it 's all taken in on the hips . Have you got something borrowed and something blue ? " I put my hand on her shoulder . " Do n't worry , Belle , " I said again . " It 's going to be all right . " My mind moved over the scene , slowly and a little sadly , because I had been sure it would be all right once she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the family : at the last momentwe all could pull ourselves together and behave quite well . We all got through the wedding and everyone made that trite remark that Bella was such a pretty bride . I could have gone on thinking about it further because Cousin Clothilde must have been thinking about it too , while her hand still rested on mine. 82 " Weddings are such queer things , " she said . " It would be much better if people did n't make such a fuss about them . " " It would have been all right , " I said , " if you had left them alone . No one would leave them alone . " Cousin Clothilde drew her hand away and Bella 's wedding seemed to move away with it . The wedding had become one of those incidents again to be put away carefully and forgotten like old clothes which are not worn out enough to give away and yet which are too old to continue wearing . " No , " said Cousin Clothilde , " nothing could have helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I began to speak but she stopped me . " Impossible for Bella , I mean . Do n't be hard on Bella when you think of it . I do wish she would marry someone else . " We were interrupted before I could answer . There were alwayssudden interruptions at Wickford Point which confused logical trains of thought . The door of Cousin Clothilde 's room opened . It was her daughter Mary . Mary Brill was in a gingham dress ; she had a towel around her head , and she was holding three silk stockings and a brassiere . " What will I do with these ? " Mary asked . Cousin Clothilde sat up straighter . " How should I know what to do with them , dear ? " she said . " Do I have to tell everyone what to do with everything ? Ca n't I rest here quietly in the morning without having everyone in the house come up and ask me questions ? Whose are they ? " " I do n't know whose they are , " Mary said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , why did n't you leave them in the laundry ? " said Cousin Clothilde . " What did you bring them in here for ? Get them out of here , dear . I do n't want to look at them . " " No one ever wants to look at me , " said Mary . This was a remark which Mary often made in the bosom of83the family , but she must have known it was not true . A great many people enjoyed looking at her . " It is n't you , dear , " said Cousin Clothilde patiently , " it 's just that I do n't like to see a brassiere in the morning , particularly if I do n't know whose it is . " " No one ever helps me about anything , " said Mary . Her face seemed to break into triangles and circles . She began to cry and left the room . " Now there , " said Cousin Clothilde , " now what did I say that should have made her cry ? I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't see that I said a single thing to disturb her . Of course I know why she 's crying  --  it 's because she does n't attract men . Ca n't you show her how to attract men ? I should think that you or Sid or Harry could show her . Ca n't you do anything about it ? " " No , I ca n't , " I said , " and besides you 're not really correct . Just do n't keep turning her into a problem . When she 's happy she attracts men enough  --  and better ones than Bella . You make her feel inadequate . " " Well , go out and talk to her , " said Cousin Clothilde . " She 'll only cry more if I do . " " It wo n't do any good , " I said . " She only wants attention . " " Of course she wants attention , " said Cousin Clothilde , " but she does n't want it from me . Please go out and talk to her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Mary running down the side entry past the row of wooden pegs where our coats used to be hung and past the table where they used to keep the candles ready for bedtime . Before I could call after her she had slammed the door and was streaking across the lawn with the stockings and brassiere billowing behind her . She ran through the old garden , past the asparagus bed and past the ice house . I was afraid that she was going to step into what had once been a row of cold frames , but she avoided them and ran into the empty hay barn . The pastureland at Wickford Point had been sold thirty years before to Mr. Casey on the main road , who kept a milk route and sold manure . There had been no cattle at Wickford Point since that time , but it still smelt of cattle around the barns . There was an odor of stale hayseed , which was combined with all those other musty odors , the sort which a realistic writer who deals with nature and the soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotting badly , allowing ribbons of dusty sunlight to come through the roof , so that the long wooden building was not dark . Mary was standing in the center of the floor between the empty lofts where the hay wagons had once stood and the shafts of sunlightfell upon her thick yellow hair . She whirled about when she heard my step . " I wish you 'd go away , " she said . " Why ca n't anybody leave me alone ? " It was my observation , based upon a certain amount of ex- 85perience , that most women were attractive when they wept ; at least there was a sense of helplessness and an appeal to the protectiveinstinct that made one want to do something about it . Mary , on the contrary , was not attractive , for when she cried , she cried without repression and without regard to the artistic decencies . The floodgates of her soul poured from her patient eyes and caused her cheeks to swell and redden until she looked more like a hay fever sufferer than a damsel in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case she might weep upon my shoulder and infect me with some of her sodden hopelessness , and there was not much use in saying anything to her , although I could understand a good deal of what was passing in her mind . I thought of how she looked when she laughed . At such times I liked her better than all the others . She had more of her mother 's kindness than the rest of them . " You ought not to do that , " I said . " You look like hell when you cry , Mary . " Her answer had an irrefutable sort of logic . " Nobody cares how I look , " she said . She always reacted that way when she was with the family . " Well , it does n't do any good to pity yourself , " I told her . " If you have n't a handkerchief , wipe your face on one of those stockings . Your mother did n't mean to hurt your feelings . You know you should n't jump at her with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her broad , blunt nose . " It does n't do any good not to pity myself , " she said . " What do you mean by that ? " I asked . She did not know what she meant very clearly , but she stuck to the point . " I 'm sick and tired of waiting on everybody , " she said and wiped her nose . " Somebody 's got to wash Clothilde 's stockingssometime . Somebody 's got to do something . Josie ca n't do everything . " We were repeating an age-old conversation which would lead nowhere . " But nobody asks you to do anything , " I said , as I tried to expressa logical but useless fact . " Do n't you see that everyone had much rather that you did n't try to do anything ? It makes people nervous and then they get cross , and it makes you tired and then you cry . Nobody wants anything done around here . You ought to try to adjust yourself to it . " " I ca n't , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " She broke into a fresh spasm of sobs . " Sid would n't even let me pick up his room . Do you know what Sid does ? " " No , " I said . It was better when her mind was off herself . She rubbed another stocking , a flesh-colored one with a run in it , over her eyes . " He does n't use his bureau drawers , " she said . The remark was confusing and I asked her what she meant . " He does n't bother to put his clothes in them , " she said . " He just leaves them all over the floor , all his clean ones and all his dirty ones , and most of his suits , all on the floor . He says it 's easier to find them . When he wants a shirt or a pair of socks , he takes one of those old canes that were in the hall closet and he just pokes around until he finds it . He does n't even bother to stoop down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on . It is n't funny either . " " I did n't say it was , " I said . " But why does it matter to you ? You ca n't do anything about it . " Mary looked at the hayseed on the old barn floor . She kicked at it with the toe of a high-heeled slipper . " You do n't understand , " she said . " Nobody understands . I just want to be happy . " " Oh , is that all you want ? " I asked . Mary looked sullen and she looked puzzled too . " That is n't asking much , is it ? " she inquired . " I have a right to be happy , have n't I ? Has n't everyone a right to be happy ? " There was no telling where she had gathered the idea , whether from some boy friend or from some loose snatches of an evening 's talk , but it reminded me of a Fourth of July phrase  --  " the pursuit86 87of happiness . " Everyone had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard we chased it now ! My thoughts did n't make much sense . " You ca n't be happy if you 're thinking about it , " I said . " You 're only happy when your mind is on something else , Mary . Then occasionally happiness comes over you when you do n't notice it . Even so , it only lasts for a few moments . I should n't let it worry me if I were you . " " That 's the way you always talk , " said Mary . " If you 'd ever been happy you would n't talk that way . " " Well , " I said , " do n't let it worry you . " " But I 've been trying to think of something else , " Mary said . " I 've been trying to do something for other people . That 's what I was doing this morning . " " Well , " I said , " it does n't always work . I guess I 'd better be going back now . " Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sid would n't let me fix his room , " she said , " and he borrowed ten dollars , and now Bella 's got it . Bella gets everything , and now she 's going to the Jaeckels ' , and you 're going to New York . " " Well , " I said , " you 're not missing much . " Mary sniffed but she was feeling better . " That 's the way you always talk , " she said . " Is n't there something I can do about myself ? Ca n't you ever tell me something ? " I reached in my trousers ' pocket and drew out a ten-dollar bill . " There , " I said , " do n't worry about yourself any more , and do n't let anybody get this away from you . " As I watched her holding the currency , the effect was amazing . The sunlight in the barn was suddenly bright . The barnswallows darting through the open door made joyful hurrying sounds . The sun fell on Mary 's yellow hair . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a delicately happy curve , and she looked the way she did when all the boys in the room wanted to dance with her . She looked the way she did on the rare times when she made Bella jealous. 88 " Do n't let anyone else know you have it , " I said , " until you 've spent it . And that means you 'd better spend it quick . " It was just as though she had never cried . " I wonder if there 's any gas in the car , " she said . " There ought to be enough in it to get downtown . Did you hear that Harry is coming up from New York , and Mirabel Steiner ? Maybe they 'll bring some boys with them . Do you think so ? Mirabel 's wonderful . Do n't you think she is ? How long is Bella staying with the Jaeckels ? They 'll probably ask her to stay for the week end , do n't you think ? " " Yes , " I said , " probably . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " Mary called . " Be sure to be back . You must n't stay away . " I had already made up my mind not to be back if I could possiblyhelp it . I wanted to return to some other environment where the strange trivialities of living did not magnify themselves into matters of vital significance ; where cigarettes and gin and grocerieshad a way of appearing without undue effort ; where there was something to discuss besides peculiar personalities . In other words , the family and the place were getting , as they always did after a brief sojourn with them , distinctly on my nerves . I wanted to convince myself that what the family did and thought amounted to very little . By the time I had reached the asparagus bed , Mary caught up with me . I was thinking that the asparagus bed had been planted a hundred and twenty-five years ago , which was too long for a bed to bear asparagus fit to eat . The whole thing should have been turned over and replanted , but then nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or trees or flowers . The whole place was like a clock which was running down , an amazing sort of clock , now devoid of weights or springs or hands yet ticking on through some ancient impetus on its own momentum . Always when you thought it was going to stop , it would continue ticking . " You 're going to see Joe , are n't you ? " Mary said . " I do n't think you ought to . " 89 " Do n't you ? " I asked . " Why not ? " Mary had assumed a virtuous expression and a bright sort of superiority that was a good deal worse than tears . " Of course I do n't believe in taking sides , " Mary said , " and I do n't really feel angry with Joe , but it 's just a matter of the family . Of course he 's entirely lost his position now . " " What ? " I said . " His position , " said Mary , " with everyone who matters . Of course everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance and he lost it . He wo n't get any help from the Brill name any more  --  and he would come back any minute if Bella would let him . She has only to crook her finger . " She was entirely serious about it . She was simply stating an acceptedfact . " Do you really mean , " I asked , " that you think the Brill name means anything ? Do you think that anybody remembers  --  " Her laugh stopped me . It was an airy , collected laugh . " Of course you 're not a Brill , " she said , " hut lots of people think you are a Brill . That 's why you go everywhere ; that 's why you know everyone , just the way we do . I-Iarry says so , so does Sid . It does n't matter whether we have any money or anything , because we 're important . " I did not continue the subject with her , because I did not want to make her cry . " You had better go and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Brills wash their faces sometimes . " Mary laughed again , that same light , airy laugh which implied a favorable difference from less privileged human beings . Mary was no longer suffering from melancholia ; she was now Miss Brill , the eldest daughter of that interesting family steeped in the best literary tradition , the granddaughter of John Brill , whose works were now out of print , but who in some odd manner had succeeded in elbowing himself into a place among the gods and half-gods of the Emersonian tradition . Mary had never seen him90  --  but now she was Miss Brill . Mary had not read his works , but they were the keystone in her arch , and perhaps it was better to let it go at that . I walked over toward the riverbank , and I realized that I had nearly lost my temper . It did not seem possible that I should have been disturbed by a harmless old man with a long white beard slightly stained by tobacco juice . That beard had been so dense and luxuriant that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn one . I was angry at an old man a long time dead , who had done nothing more hostile.to me than to pat my head when I was eight years old  --  as angry as though he were still living . Actually his demise had never been wholly accepted at Wickford Point . He was always being dished up at convenient moments ; being wheeled out at teatime ; cropping up in conversation . People kept asking if I were not in some way or other related to old Brill . It did no good to explain very carefully that I was not , nor to explainfurther that his verses were atrocious and that he was nothing but an overrated fraud who had battened on his acquaintance with the great figures of his time . No one in the present day had ever read or wished to read anything he had written , and yet he was a good deal more of a figure now than he had been while alive , when he was only an ungifted Boswell with a death grip on the coattails of his betters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the oppositeshore the white house in which John Brill had lived . The literary shrine was now frequented by motorists from the Middle West who paid fifty cents to enter . A motor travel association had even published a page in their " Tours through Old New England " entitled " A Glimpse into the Brill Country . " When you paid your fifty cents , a hostess would show you around the house . You could see the study , furnished with very bad Victorian furniture , exactly as Mr. Brill had left it , except that they had removed his plug of tobacco and his cuspidor . There were a number of framed autographed letters upon the wall from personal friends9rof Mr. Brill , which had not been there in his lifetime . The old gentleman had always kept them in an album to show to callers . Even the hostess did n't know exactly who Mr. Brill was , nor was this entirely the point . The point was the Spartan simplicity of those surroundings . Mr. Brill had loved to roam the hills . He had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case in the hall containing birds that he had stuffed himself . Up in the bedroom you could see his walking boots , out in the woodshed was his ax . He had loved the dignity of manual toil , and even when he was eighty-five years old he could be found in the wood lot up the hill  --  if he knew in advance that friends were coming . He also loved to whittle . There was a maple howl in the dining room which he had made himself , and out of which he ate his porridge  --  when there were guests at dinner . Perhaps I might have liked him if I had been his contemporary , but now that he was dead he was not likeable . From my point of view he had even done a good deal to spoil the river , for things which he had writ- ten about it lingered poisonously in my memory . Even now I could not get some lines of his out of my mind :  --  0 river , mighty river , How often have I rowed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In thy course pellucid to the sea . May our souls move on as tranquil As thy waters past the bank , Like the birds of Wickford , thankful To the Maker they must thank . Surely I was right in allowing these lines to fill me with a defi- nite and abiding horror . Certainly he had done better than that , but it was the worst I always remembered . Sometimes at night I would lie awake , conjuring up lines old 13611 had written , and yet when I quoted them no one would believe they were his . The river must have been wonderful when he was young . The shad would run up it in the spring and there was a run of salmon also . Now it had an oily odor from the cotton mills upstream . Down by the old landing where they used to tie the salt hay barges , the tide was going out leaving an expanse of thick black mud . The shore was covered with unsightly bits of driftwood . In spite of the farms along its edge the Wickford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its shores had a neglected look and our bank was no exception . Every afternoon , in the old days , my grandmother and her sisters had walked along a little path beneath the birches and the oaks to a grove of white pines on our point . There they would sit and read and sew with all the ordered industry of their generation . When my greatauntSarah was still alive , she would put on her bonnet and her shawl at least once a day to walk out there . I had used the path a good deal myself when I was young enough to wander about the place playing games of imagination , but that was all quite a while ago , and since then no one went there very often . Cousin Clothilde was never much at walking . She once said the point was a wonderfulplace to go when you were in love , yet as far as I could gather neither Bella nor Mary felt that way . I do n't think Bella had gone as far as that even with Mr. Berg , and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bothered to clear it out . Earle started to do it once , but it took him all morning to find something to clear it with ; and then , when he did find the ax where it had been buried in the coalbin , the handle came off and he bruised his finger . As far as I could tell , I was the only one now who went to the point . The jungle was creeping over it , laying a blanket of unkemptwildness beneath the straight trunks of the tall white pines . All the strange growth of unused places was rising among fallen branches , which snapped beneath one 's steps , but once you were among the pines there was a solemn , restful silence . Even the noises in their tops were discreet and careful like repressed rustlings in church . I used to think when I was a boy that the pines were92 93whispering of Wickford Point , and they were at their old game of gossip when I stood among them that morning . First there would be a whisper and then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of laughter . " My dear , " they were saying , " do n't tell me you 've never heard ... the most amazing thing , I hardly venture to repeat it .. . as long as you understand that it 's to be kept inside the family ... it is so reminiscent of the others ... and will you only look who 's out here now  --  Jim Calder ! He thinks he 's changed , but he has n't . It 's hardly polite to laugh too loud , and it 's not polite to whisper . He 's going away . He 's going to see Joe Stowe again . He will try to forget about us , but he wo n't forget . It does n't matter where he goes , he 's out here half the time , even when he 's away . He 's always here , because we caught him as a boy . It does n't matter where he dies , he 'll be hack here . Do n't laugh too loud . It 's rude to laugh when they think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queer . I could never remember even as a child being afraid at Wickford Point , but the whole place was queer . There had been too many people there . It was like a crowded room when I stood beneath the trees. 94IXIt Wo n't Take a Minute to PackBella was out on the lawn when I got back . She must have been working hard on herself , because she was nearly ready to leave . She always knew how to dress , although I had never seen her take any care of her clothes . When her clothes were not on her back , they were usually in a ball in her bureau drawer or somewhere in the bottom of a suitcase , except the ones which belonged to her mother or to Mary . Still they always had an air when she wore them , for she had the slender insolent figure of a clothing model , and a model 's careless poise . Now she was no longer a sleepy girl in slacks , but Bella Brill , ready for the races , ready for anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could give herself a shake and a pat and out would come every wrinkle so that you could not tell whether anybody had made a pass at her or not . Everything was very simple , but every line was right . She had on a blue silk dress and short cape and a felt hat of the halo type jammed tight over her short black curls . She was carrying a small bag that matched nothing in particular , which she had picked up at one of Willie Hewitt 's parties in New York , after everybody else had gone . Everything about her was impeccable , but she created her usual illusion of not having much of anything on underneath . She had not got around to her footgear yet . Her delicately tanned legs were bare and she was wearing a pair of red mules . " Where have you been , darling ? " Bella asked . " Out to the point , " I answered. 95 " Now look here , " she said . She was eager , brisk and businesslike . " Suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other pants , and if they 're not pressed , get Josie to press ' em . She 's been whining in the kitchen all morning . Everybody 's whining here and bellyaching . It 's like that wall where the Jews wail in Jerusalem . Clothilde 's grousing and so is Mary . That 's why I 'm waiting out here , because I ca n't stand it . Now go upstairs and get on some other clothes and let me see what sort of a tie you 've got . And brush your hair in back , darling . You would n't have to look the way you do if you did n't want to . Why is it that I have to do everything for everybody ? " " Because everybody here , " I said , " does everything for every-body . " Bella looked at me out of the corners of her eyes . " Do n't get off any cracks , darling , " she said . " I do do everything for everybody . How do you like the ensemble ? " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " It 's Mary 's , " Bella said . " It is n't too tight over the tail , is it ? Mary always has them too tight there , but she dresses so badly that nobody cares when she looks immodest . It does n't look bad on me , does it ? When I picked it out for Mary , I thought it might work in . " " What are you going to use for shoes ? " I asked . " I do n't know why it is , " said 13ella , " that nobody can get anything around here done . Mary 's darning my stockings . You might have thought that she was going to snap my head off when I suggested it . And Frieda 's whitening my shoes . " " Do n't get so excited , " I said . " You might rip something . " " Do n't be so damn sour , " said Bella ; but she was ' excited . " There 's some cold lamb and potatoes for lunch . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on , let 's get out of here before we both go nuts . Here 's Frieda now . " Frieda came walking across the lawn , carrying two white slip-96pers , each in a thumb and forefinger . She swayed gracefully at the hips . Her thick brown hair was woolly from a brand-new permanentfor which Josie had borrowed the money from me two days before , saying that she could pay me back fifteen cents each week . Frieda was not being herself ; she was being a glamour girl , a Cinderella from Hollywood , and she was not badlooking . I did not blame Earle for crying when he did not have a dollar to take her to the beach . No doubt Frieda was going to make a lot of other boys cry before she was through . " Hello , Frieda , " I said . Frieda looked at me out of the corners of her eyes , a trick she had learned from Bella . She was wearing the dress with pink dots which she had inherited after Bella spilled rum punch down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bow over the bosom , a bit off-center , concealed most of the damage . The stain might have come out altogether if there had not been strawberry in the mixture . Frieda smiled , the languid easy smile of a woman of the world . " Hi , " she said . She was not trying to be fresh or rude . She just wanted to show  --  and I could sympathize with her , since she was n't being paid for it  --  that she was n't a servant but just an old friend of the family out here to do Bella a kindly favor . " Thanks , Frieda , " said Bella . " That 's darling of you . " " That 's okay , " said Frieda . " Take these slippers back , will you , Frieda ? " said Bella . " Okay , " Frieda said . " So long . " The house was built upon a peculiar plan , resulting largely from my great-grandfather 's additions and improvements . The main building , which could be placed by its construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms , two lower and two upper , with a low ell in back , containing the stairs to the upper chambers , and an open fireplace for summer cooking . This ell my great-grandfather had extensively enlarged in the early eighteen hundreds after a successful voyage . What had97been the summer kitchen now became the back parlor , and there were rooms beyond it and a kitchen to one side and bedchambers above it . The first stairs had been closed up and now access to the upper floor was gained by the back stairs off the new kitchen , and by a narrow flight in the side entry . If one entered the back parlor from the lawn , it was necessary to cross the front parlor and the dining room to reach the stairs , and consequently there was never much privacy . Someone was nearly always crossing through the rooms , or bursting in through the narrow little passages leadingthrough the wood closet to the kitchen , either on the way upstairs or to the bathroom out in back ; and by coincidence the intruder was nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The best place for confidences was in somebody 's bedroomupstairs provided no one else came in to borrow something . When I came in from the lawn , however , the hack parlor and the front parlor were both empty and , as Earle had not yet been able to find where the outside blinds had been stored and as there were no shades or curtains , the sunlight was coming through the lilacs and syringas that were growing up before the windows . Although the paper and the woodwork were a drab smoky sort of brown , the sun and the foliage by the small paned windows gave an effect of gold and green . This dim cool light made the perpetual disorder of the room less noticeable , and gave it an appearance of agelessness . The furniture still remained almost exactly as my great-aunt Sarah had arranged it . There were even the same ornaments upon the mantelpiece and on top of her desk , except for a few delicate ones , like the small blue china dog that had held lamplighters in its mouth . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upholstery was torn and that Josic had neglected to removelast night 's cigarette butts from the fireplace . It was possible to avoid the immediate sight of white rings made by gin and water glasses , and the burns of cigarettes upon the console tableand candle-stands . That gold sunlight which darted between the lilac and syringa leaves made a constantly shifting pattern on the dusty leather books that stood against the opposite wall . The sun might have been looking over my great-grandfather 's library , vacillating between some favorite titles , now hitting upon the thick back of the Guide to Peru , now shifting erratically to the poems of Addison . I observed the presence of these books and objects only in the half-conscious way in which one notices the friendly and the utterlyfamiliar . The books always seemed to me closer to humanity than the furniture . They were more sensitive than the Chippendaleend-chair with its broken back , or the Windsors or the Boston rocker , or the Queen Anne chair with its legs sawed off to fit Aunt Sarah 's mother . I walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The family photograph album was in its place upon the second shelf of the whatnot , between the two large snail-shells which my great-grandfather had brought back from Pago Pago . There was no reason for picking up the album except that Bella had told me to hurry . I was anxious to hurry in one way and in another way I resented it , for the small parlor was peaceful and full of nostalgic slumber . If it could only have remained so , I should have liked to stay there always . I seemed to have come upon it unawares , when the portraits on the wall had not expected any living intruder . I sat down in the small upholstered chair beside the coal grate with the album on my knees . It was the same chair in which old Mr. Beardsley , the Unitarian minister , once sat withoutnoticing that Aunt Sarah 's cat Prissy was there before him . I remembered what Aunt Sarah had said to Mr. Beardsley , a scrap of conversation which she often repeated . " Did she claw you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , Miss Sarah , " Mr. Beardsley answered , " higher up . " They were delicate in those days , as careful in their mannersas they were in their poses when they sat fat those . pictures in thealbum . I turned to one that I liked to look at best , a large group of the family and friends seated upon the lawn with the old oak tree just behind them . It had been a fine summer day in the eighties and you could almost feel the still , moist heat . It looked as if everybody must have laughed and worked hard over it . Old Mr. Mason , the photographer , whose son now ran the business and did undertaking on the side and still took all the high school class groups , must have driven all the way out from town in a hired hack . They had dragged some chairs from the back parlorout onto the lawn and also a lot of cushions , for it was just the beginning of the sofa-cushion era . The older generation were in the middle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the archers and slingers of a Roman legion , or else they were lying in recumbent positions in the foreground  --  the boys , of course , not the girls . A lot of the people in that picture I had never seen , except at family funerals ; and , indeed , most of them by now had acted the definitive and principal role on one of those occasions . I could see Aunt Sarah and then my grandfatherand my grandmother seated in armchairs with children and nephews and nieces all about them . My grandfather had an impatient look that I remembered , as though he were about to swear , and I knew why . He was having the same indigestion that he always had at Wickford Point when he drank that Goddamnedwell water . I could see my father with a handlebar mustache , and my mother with some sort of bustle . My uncle Percy and Hugh Brill were in striped blazers , with caps now seen only upon a baseball diamond . The young people carried strange pear-shaped tennis racquets and one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although they all looked queer . Now , just a few minutes before , my cousin Bella had been worried about her dress being tight over her posterior . Back in those days of bustles they did n't have to worry . The girls ' dresses flowed down to their ankles ; they , had on tight little short-sleeved coatsand some of them wore small felt hats . The one I liked best of all was Cousin Clothilde near the right-hand corner . She was sitting sideways on a kitchen table , with her slender ankles dangling , and , forgetful of herself , she was looking at all the rest of them . She had that friendly , tolerant look of hers , combined with gentle amusement . She was more beautiful then , more beautiful than Bella , sitting surrounded by that tranquil sense of sureness which had never left her . It was the sureness that had made her say , upstairs just an hour ago , that Mr. Rooseveltwould help her . Nothing had broken her inner tranquillity and nothing would ever break it . I liked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I used to remember her , back in the days when our nurses would take Harry and me to the riverbank where we used to throw pine cones at Sid . She was just as I remembered her the day when she had stopped Aunt Sarah from striking me with her cane because I had picked a cardinal flower beneath the elm tree where they once had hung a pig . I did not realize that anyone was behind me until I heard Bella 's voice . " For God 's sake , " said Bella , " have n't you done anything ? Have n't you changed your clothes ? " " No , " I said , " I was looking at the picture . " " Well , put it up , " said Bella . " You all sit around here as if you had hookworm or something . There 's no use trying to get anyone to move . We may as well stay and eat that lamb and potatoes now , and start off at four o'clock ; but I 'm going to see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go . Now come on , really , darling . " " All right , " I said . " It wo n't take a minute to pack . " " I 'm coming up with you , " Bella said , " or else you wo n't put on a decent shirt or tie , and besides you may have a cigarette somewhere . Do you know I have been all morning without a cigarette ? " Ioo I0II noticed again what had struck me outside on the lawn , that Bella was excited . Bella could not deceive me , for I had seen her run through all her moods ever since she was a little girl , and an adult seldom develops a different set of reactions . In Bella 's eyes and at the corners of her lips  --  she had been at work with her mother 's lipstick , which was of a slightly different color tone from hers  --  was the bright anticipatory look of one of our WickfordPoint barn cats waiting for the wire mouse-trap to be opened . Perhaps the simile was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same soft luminous qualities and her body swayed gently as though she were going to purr . Her eyes and lips had an expression which I had observed when she used to be ushered upstairs in New York , scrubbed and tied up in a blue sash , to wait for the Christmas tree . There was no doubt that something new had appeared in Bella 's life which had not been visible the day before . She was looking forward to that ride with me , and I knew it was not on my account ; nor was it entirely because she was glad to get away from the family . There was something waiting for her at the Jaeckels ' , something that she knew about already , something which she could snatch at , some cosmic sort of Christmas tree . I thought I could guess what it was . It would be a man , and the most likely man would be Berg , the one who did so well in business that he could always get away from New York . It was not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in males was catholic and unpredictable . There had probably been some who were worse than Berg , but the time was coming when I should have to talk to her about this , although talking never did much good . Something had happened to the cushion in the rumble seat of my car . It was my idea that Earle had dragged it out under some tree where he could sit with Frieda , but Earle had either forgottenabout it or was afraid to remember . At any rate it made no difference . It simply meant that there was a lot more room forIO2bags and things . Earle was standing near the car wiping some places on the hood where the barnswallows had misbehaved . Josie was at the kitchen door holding her youngest child by the back of its rompers so that it would not crawl under the wheels . Cousin Clothilde was at the side door in her silk wrapper , and Sid had propped himself up against the side of the house near the bed of white myrtle . Mary was looking out of the bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . Bella appeared carrying a round black patent-leather hatbox , which she had borrowed from one of the Clifton girls the time they had asked her up to Seal Harbor two years ago , and which she had forgotten so far to return . The hatbox was bulging but it was adequate . If necessary Bella could go away from home for six months with just that hatbox , and she would have everything in it too , from slacks to a formal ball-dress . Bella slid into the seat of the car with a swift nymphlike motion which caused her light blue skirt to fly upward disclosing her sheer silk stockings , her sister Mary 's round garters in which Josie had taken a reef , and also a generous section of brown thigh . At this sight Cousin Clothilde , who generally seemed ageless , showed her age . " Dear , your dress , " she said . " There 's no use flying in the face of nature , " Bella said . " Has n't everyone got legs ? " Cousin Clothilde glanced meaningly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bella disregarded . " But Bella , " said Cousin Clothilde , " you have n't got any  --  " " Pants ? " said Bella . " Nobody wears ' em nowadays . And who would wash ' em if I wore ' em ? " Mary spoke from the upper bathroom window . " Well , I wear them , " she said . " You do n't look decent . " " I know you do , " said Bella , " and that 's one of your troubles , sweetness . " Cousin Clothilde lapsed into the tolerant silence of one who103accepts the universe . Josie took a firmer grip on her infant 's rompers . Sid leaned more appreciatively against the wall of the house , and Earle returned to his work on the car 's hood . Bella coiled herself comfortably on the small of her back . She conveyed the indefinable impression of one who is used to any situation which may arise in any automobile , whether in motion or stationary . " For heaven 's sake , " she said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the car , Jim ? There 's no use doing any more rubbing , Earle . There are sea gulls where we 're going . " Earle blushed and gave a high , shocked giggle . As Josie always said , harle had been brought up in a lovely home among lovely people . Cousin Clothilde looked at me and frowned and smiled at the same time . That bewildered amusement was something I loved best about her , for it showed both her age and her perennial youth . She was asking me wordlessly if I did not think that Bella was perfectly charming , so beautiful , so gay . She was asking me if I did not think it was strange that some of those people whom Bella played about with in New York , some of those importantpeople who are always looking for new talent in the motionpicture business , had not snapped up Bella . She knew about a thing called a " screen test . " Cousin Clothilde had been asking about screen tests often recently . They were all standing there  --  as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving , half-listlessly and half-wistfully , like dwellers on an island watching a ship sail  --  making their last requests now that we were going into the outer world . " Darling , " Cousin Clothilde said to me , " do n't forget to bring some gin back with you and some cartons of cigarettes , and pick up as many papers of matches as you possibly can  --  we 're almost out of matches . " " Jim , " Sid said , " will you get me some bicarbonate of soda and some boric acid and an eye cup ? " 104 " Mr. Calder , " Earle said , " you have n't got me that copy of True Romances yet , and will you bring a chocolate nut bar , Mr. Calder ? " Frieda moved coyly toward the car and looked at me hard with wide brown eyes in a way she had learned after reading about charm on the woman 's page . " Could you , " she said , " do just one little errand at some drug-store ? " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bella said . " Bella ! " said Cousin Clothilde . Frieda 's shoulders writhed and she forgot about charm . " Just a lipstick , Mr. Calder , " Frieda said . " They call it Orange Kiss . Can you remember , Orange Kiss ? " " Oh ! " said Bella . " Watch yourself , Earle . " " Aw say , Miss Brill , " Earle stammered , " nuts ! " I stepped on the self-starter . The trouble at Wickford Point was that everybody developed a personality . In a patriarchal system , if you did n't pay the help enough , they always turned into characters . I gave the engine a little gas to warm it up , but now Josie was speaking . " Mr. Calder , " Josie called , " if you was to see some bobby pins , Mr. Calder  --  " " What ? " I said . " Bobby pins , " called Josie , " those little things that hold the hair . " Bella nudged me impatiently . A roar came from Josie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " all right , Herman dear . Herman wants to give you a kiss , Mr. Calder . " Bella laughed softly and collapsed against me so that I could feel her shaking all over . Josie held Herman 's face close to mine . Herman smelled of hard-boiled eggs , sour milk and other things . " Pretend you 're running for Congress , darling , " Bella said . Mary did not ask for anything , but then Mary had ten dollars. 105XSpeak to Me of LoveWe turned out of the yard and went up the hill beneath an arch of elm trees . At the summit there was a glimpse of the river on the left . Then came the shrubbery and the walls of dressed stone and the white buildings of the Jeffries farm , which a New York man named Mr. Henry Whitaker had bought five years before as a summer place . He had built a tennis court , and there were some tables with colored umbrellas beside it . The Whitakers had been there for five years but we had never spoken to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would be dwellers on another planet , for we resented their intrusion . We only gathered gossip about the Whitakers , and we still called it the Jeffries farm . We were passing the last hayfield of the Jeffries farm when Bella realized that she had forgotten something . " Oh Jim , " she said , " I 've forgotten my purse . I thought it was in this bag . We do n't want to go back , do we ? Lend me ten dollars , will you ? " " All right , " I said . " Thanks , " said Bella . " You 're awfully sweet , darling . " And she leaned against me comfortably and contentedly . " It 's nice to get out of there , is n't it ? " she said . " Yes , " I answered , because I was thinking and I did not want to talk . " Everybody gets so damned screwy down there , " Bella said . " They just sit and sit . " " Yes , " I said. io6I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I understood about Wickford Point a good deal better than she did , because I had been there more often . Bella lapsed into silence and , as she stared straight ahead , I had a glimpse of her profile . Her face was beautiful at any angle  --  but now I saw something new in it . There was just the slightest indication , so small that it was only a suspicion , that Bella might lose her looks some day . In spite of her beauty and her comparative youth  --  she was much younger than I was  --  Bella , like the rest of us , was getting on . Someday she would realize  --  perhaps she had a premonition of it now  --  that you ca n't be young forever . There would come the time , which often arrives quite suddenly , when the face matures , when the curves about the cheek and chin are not quite so youthful or so naive as they were once . A time was approaching when little faults and greater ones would write their records distinctly upon her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her features had always been sensitive , aristocratic , intelligent , and illuminated by what the experts call " charm " or " personality . " Admittedly these attributes had not as yet departed . She was still the girl whom any man would select in a large room , the girl whom for some reason other women instinctivelyhated , except those few who were near enough her type to cope with her in the great free-for-all arena where no holds or bites or scratchings or tongue-lashings were barred . Neverthelessit seemed to me now that her face was a little sharper and a trifle thinner than I had ever remembered it . There was a new definition to the curve of her delicate nostrils which was almost harsh . Perhaps it was there because she did not think that I was looking . There was a new straightness to the lips that so many men had wished to kiss , or had kissed , and the lines of her jaw were not so completely graceful as they had once been . Yes , Bella , like the rest of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knee for a moment in a careless caressing gesture. 107 " Darling , " Bella said . Her voice was comforting and sweet . It was a comment , a soft contented ejaculation , which needed no reply . When she touched me and when she spoke it was not difficult to understand why so many men had loved her . I found myself thinking about love , but not on her account . I was thinking of it because we had passed the Jeffries farm . I was recalling that strange diseaselike quality which is love 's peculiar attribute and which runs its course through the patient like the depredations of some particularly vicious virus of an infiltrable nature . You got it and there you were . It was worse when you were young , for after the first attack there was a hope of developing a degree of unreliable immunity . Luella Jeffries used to live at the Jeffries farm . Her father ran a milk route and drank hard cider . Mrs. Jeffries was short and stout and used to take charge of the suppers at the Grange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as uneducated farmers . I looked upon them as very noble people once . I would have died gladly for old man Jeffries , though I hope he never knew it . He certainly never knew that I used to lie awake imagining ways in which I could die for him . This greatest of all sacrifices was generally connected with Mr. Jeffries ' bull , for the neighborhood knew that the animal was fierce and had chased Mr. Jeffries once . Frequently I imagined myself leaping over the barbed wire of Mr. Jeffries ' pasture as the maddened animal thundered after the retreating form of that splendid man , who was courageous but slowed down by his years . I would tell Mr. Jeffries to run while I turned the bull from his course upon myself  --  to run , because Jeffries was Luella 's father . Later I would be carried on a shutter into the Jeffries ' kitchen , a beautiful place where the vinegar and grease had a heady ambrosial scent , and Luella would weep and kiss me then . I could tell her that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was only a single sample of my delirium . I never toldIo8Luella that I loved her . I was never able to say anything to her except infrequent monosyllables , for she was so infinitely far above me . She wore a shirtwaist with a high collar and had a big butterfly bow at the back of her hair . We used to meet on the trolley car going to high school . She sat beside me twice in all the time we went to school , but I never had the courage to take advantage of these accidents . Later she married Louis Bedard , who ran the Sea Food Lunch downtown . I sometimes saw her even now , behind the cashier 's desk in the restaurant . Heaven alone knows why I ever loved her . After all , love was a biological phenomenon marked by certain well-defined characteristics which repeated themselves almost exactlyin nearly every normal human being . I sometimes wondered why people did not accept it as a definite and incontrovertible fact , instead of continually harping on the subject in music and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's contributions , though interesting , seemed inconclusive . They had merely called an open season upon certain aspects of the malady not heretofore considered fit discussion for mixed society . Now , almost anywhere , an intelligent and liberated individual could dominate a dinner table with a thoughtful discussion of sexual perversions or of various intimate activities . All the really good writers of my time had explored this field at length and with conspicuoussuccess , but had they gone any further than Tolstoy ? Had they even said as much as Jane Austen , who said exactly nothing ? I was wondering whether it was better to love afar and in vain , as I had loved Luella Jeffries , or to have one 's love requitedand then , when the disease had run its course , to find that one had not loved at all and to marvel at the things which one had said and done and written . Surely love made marriage dangerous , since neither contracting party was in a normal state . First there had been Luella , and then there had been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been above me , too ethereal , too beautiful . Then there had been the French girl whom I had picked up in the Botanical Gardens at Bordeaux . She had not been above me , but when my mind got to Michelle I decided it was time to stop . At any rate I was still good at idiomaticFrench , although scholars had told me that I spoke it with a provincial patois . I owed a good deal to Michelle , and , by odd coincidence , she too had married a restaurant proprietor . I had seen her at their little place three years before , just off the Rue du Bac , where D'Artagnan had once walked . She , too , was sitting behind the caisse , and I recognized her at once , although she weighed a good two hundred pounds . Michelle embraced me and she had been eating garlic . Her husband , M. I Albin , took me to the back parlor , where we drank some fines . Michelle , however , did not object when I paid for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jacked up the price on the table d'hote ten francs . And then there was Madame , on the Rue du Bray  --  but that was another matter , when love and death were all in the same bed together . Perhaps the French understood about love ; at any rate they treated it as a delightful malady . Bella 's violet eyes were half-closed , but her lips were just a trifle grim . Her expression made me wonder if she had ever loved at all . She had certainly talked enough about it . I wondered if she had been secretly in love with her father , her brothers or her mother . Certainly she had never given any visible sign of such undeveloped weakness . I wondered if she was what the Freudians  --  or was it the Jung school ?  --  called ambivalent , a state which made her so unintegrated that love was very nearly impossible . It did not seem to me that she was unintegrated , but , after all , did it make much difference ? I drove the car almost without noticing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often put myself to sleep by traveling in my mindItoalong it . Beyond the Jeffries farm was the lane which led to the cemetery and beyond that were the pine woods , warm and sweet . Next at a bend was a small white house , occupied by people whose name I had never known , and who , as far as I could tell , were unknown to everybody else . Then there was a tumbledown house with a great many brown hens in the front yard , occupied by Lithuanians . The next place belonged to Jimmy Casey , an Irishman who sometimes cut our hay and plowed our garden , when we had one . Then we were on the main road where the trolley had run once , near the abandoned brick schoolhouse , where a friend of mine , Pete Sickles , had tended the hot-air stoves . On the opposite side was Sam Kennedy 's garage . I stopped by the least expensive of his three gasoline pumps . I had known Sam when we were boys  --  it seemed a million years ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I had hated him , and since then we had never had a thing in common , and , when I came to think of it accurately , we had never had Luella in common either . Sam was pot-bellied now , dressed in a onepiecesuit of overalls , not unlike little Herman 's rompers , with the name of a popular brand of gasoline embroidered on his back . " Hello , Jim , " he said . " How do you do , Mrs. Stowe ? Want me to fill her up ? " I told him to fill her up . There was an interesting aspect to his salutation ; he called me by my first name , but he would not have done so to any of the Brills . I was almost a forgotten member of an ancient fellowship , but I was still part of the town . The Brills were from the city , but I was still a local boy . I gave Sam a bill , and after he had reached into his rompers for the change , he put his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " there was a party down from your place who had his valves ground and a new distributor and fifteen IIIgallons of gas , eleven seventy-five  --  a black-haired , thin young fellow . He told me to send him the bill to New York , but he 's never paid it . His name is Berg , Howard Berg . " Bella sat up straighter , but she made no comment . " He must have overlooked it , Sam , " I said . " If he does n't pay , you let me know . But after this you might just as well settle for cash . " Bella sat up still straighter , but she did not speak . " Thanks , Jim , " said Sam . " How 's everything ? Writing lots of articles these days ? " Bella did not speak until we were out on the road again . I saw that I had made her angry , but I was angry too . " That was a dirty crack , " Bella said . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  as though we do n't always pay our bills . " " Well , I 'm not going to stand behind any more Bergs , " I said , " or any other poor whites who come down here visiting you when they have n't got enough money in their pockets to get home . " " Do n't worry , darling , " Bella said , " about your damned eleven dollars and seventy-five cents . I know what you think of my friends , so you do n't have to say , but just in case you 'd like to know  --  just in case it would interest you  --  Howard Berg is n't any two-cent pot-boiling writer . The money you have in the bank would be like a quarter to Howard Berg . Do n't worry , your eleven dollars and seventy-five cents will be all right . " " That 's fine , " I said . " What do you know about Berg ? Where did you pick him up ? " " Just in case you want to know , " Bella said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men in Wall Street . You could hardly be expected to know , but I hope that satisfies you , darling . " " Who told you so ? " I asked . " Berg and who else ? " " Lots of other people you do n't know , darling , " Bella said . " Lots of other people you could n't possibly know , who would n't care to meet you . " 112 " Important people ? " I asked . " Yes , darling , " said Bella , " important people . It might be a help to you , darling , if you were nicer to my friends . It 's obvious you do n't like Howard Berg , do you ? He spoke of it himself . You were as rude as hell to him . If he had n't been a gentleman , he would have beaten your ears off . It just happens that Howard Berg moves in certain social groups where you have never been invited , odd as it may seem , darling . He knows a great many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playwrightsand producers . Howard Berg is a very intimate friend of Sinclair Lewis , Ernest Hemingway , Booth Tarkington , and James Branch Cabell . How do you like that , darling ? " " Is he an intimate friend of John Galsworthy ? " I asked . " It just happens , " said Bella , " that he had lunch with Mr. Galsworthy last week , when Mr. Galsworthy was over from England . Mr. Galsworthy always calls Howard up . Now butter that one on your dry toast , darling . " I had her there . I paused to savor the beauty of it . " Did you happen to know , honey bee , " I said , " that John Galsworthydied five years ago ? " Bella smiled provokingly . " It does n't do any good to lie like that , Jim , just because no really fine novelist , no really worth-while writer , no really worthwhileanything , has ever honored you by his acquaintance . " " All right , " I said . " Let 's let it go at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I think we 'd better let it go at that . Perhaps it will teach you to be civil when you see Mr. Berg again . " " What good does it do him to know writers ? " I asked . " It just happens , " Bella answered , " that Howard Berg is a very intelligent , very cultivated person , who enjoys the relaxation of associating with his intellectual equals , darling . Some people , even writers , realize that they are helped by a gracious , civilized society . " iii " You mean , " I asked , " that he keeps in touch with the finer things of life ? " " Oh , for God 's sake , shut up , " said Bella suddenly . " Do n't start getting sour and pouring bile over everybody just because you ca n't be as successful as Howard Berg . " " Hooey ! " I said . " And you need n't start using foul language either , " Bella answered . " If you ca n't behave yourself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while after that , although I began to feel warm and kindly toward Bella for the pleasure she had given me . We passed by the fountain where horses had once slaked their thirst and went more slowly down the broad street which marked the beginning of town . I remembered that Cousin Sue had once said that when she went downtown her self-confidencewas greatly buoyed up by remembering she was related to the Brills . Even without this reassurance I felt no great inadequacy . We passed the First Congregational and the Baptist Churches and the All Saints ' Episcopal ( : hurcli and the Unitarian Church , and the Acme Furniture Company with a swinging hammockin the window , and Rolfe 's Drug Store where there was a sale of hot-water bottles , an odd sight for a summer 's day , but everybody at the post office was saying that Mr. Rolfe was getting senile . Next was the Men 's Toggery , where they were displayingtropical suits , and then Mason 's Photographic Studio and Undertaking Parlor . " Darling , " said Bella . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get some cigarettes . " I parked the car down by the news store and left Bella powderingher nose and staring disinterestedly at the sights on the brick sidewalk . The traffic policeman craned his neck out of the oversize collar of his baggy uniform and looked at me and looked away . He had been the town truant officer when I was a boy . Mr. Chipping came out of the Sailors ' National Bank and walkedI14across the street , and he did n't recognize me either . Inside the news store was the old cool smell of papers , candy , ice cream sodas and cigars , an aura which was kept in constant flux by two electric fans with pink paper streamers in front of them . Some men in straw hats and alpaca coats were at the fountain drinking soda . Two girls who dressed like Frieda were eating sundaes in a booth . The men rotated on their stools and looked at me . One of them slid down to a standing position . He was fat and might have been in the American Legion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . I could not remember who he was . So much water had flowed under the bridge that I often found it difficult to recall names and faces . " How 's everything , Jim ? " he asked . " Fine , " I said . " How 's everything with you ? " " Fine , " he said . " Glad to have seen you , Jim . " Out on the sidewalk we shook hands . Bella had finished powderingher nose . " For heaven 's sake , " she said , " do n't act as though you were in homespun and try to pull the old home town stuff when you really spend all your time snooting everybody . " I backed out the car and we started up the street past the traffic lights and on to the open road . " Is Berg going to be at the Jaeckels ' ? " I asked . " And why should it affect you , darling , " asked Bella , " if Howard Berg is going to be at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he or is n't he ? " I asked . " Suppose you ask when you get there , darling , " Bella said . " Thanks , " I said , " I will . " Bella 's voice was soft with a breathless hint of apprehension . " What are you going to do ? " she asked . " Collect that garage bill , honey bee , " I said . " No damned gigolo who had a spiritual lunch with Mr. Galsworthy last week is going to take me to town for his garage bill . " I15Bella 's hand closed tight on my arm . " Jim , " she said , " do n't do that , please , please . " " Why not ? " I asked . " Please , " she said , " that 's all . It  --  it is n't the kind of thing that people do . You do n't understand Howard . Jim , darling , please be nice . Besides  --  " " Besides what ? " I asked . " Nothing , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Does it ? " " Yes , " she said , " it does . " " Bella , " I said ,  --  there were times when I could get her to tell the truth ,  --  " come across with it now . Has Berg asked you to marry him or not ? " Bella bent down and lighted her cigarette . There was a tremor in her fingers as she held the match . " Please do n't , Jim , " said Bella , " please . " It was not difficult to think of her in a detached way , as though she were something which in no sense belonged in my life . I could think dispassionately of the beauty of her face and body , of her intuitive quickness , and of the indolence and intellectual superficiality which went with it . It was not hard to recognize that she was consumed by egotism and desires . The trouble was that her desires changed so fast that she could never be wholly sure of what she wanted  --  except that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jim , " Bella said . She had been silent for quite a while , which was not such a bad idea , and now I hoped that she was not going to talk about herself . I did not want it now because I was escaping again from that life and returning to the life which I had made for myself . Nevertheless I suspected from her tone that it was coming . We still had a half an hour of fast driving before we reached the Jaeckels ' , and I wished I were there already . " I ca n't go on like this , " Bella said . Yes , it was the old , old story . She could n't go on like this , and Cousin Clothilde could n't go on like this , and neither could Harry or Sid . Each of them had said it almost daily , and still they went on just like that . " I do n't suppose you can , " I said . " I ca n't , " said Bella , " I just I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bella said . " You know what I have to put up with . I do n't mind Clothilde . She ca n't help it , but the way Mary and Sid and Harry just sit around there and talk . . . . Nobody does anything about anything . I ca n't go on like this . " " Well , what are you going to do ? " I asked . " Well , I 'll do something , " said Bella . Her voice became hard . She could rise to a crisis at odd moments . " Maybe I 'll get a job . " Then she looked at me sideways to study the effect of herstatement . I had heard her make it before , and I did not answer . I17 " You do n't think I can get a job , do you ? " Bella said . " That 's where you 're wrong as usual . If I want to , I can sign right up tomorrow night . A111 have to do is to call New York . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examined her nose in the mirror of her washed-gold compact , the one that had been given her last year when she was a bridesmaid at Jeanette Stackton 's wedding . She had thought it was all gold for nearly three months . Bella 's speech became languid and casual . " I do n't suppose , " she inquired , " that you know Dr. Wilbur Frothinghope ? " " No , " I said . " Who 's he , a fan dancer ? " " That 's so funny , " Bella said soothingly , " so very funny , darling , to take swipes at people that you never really could know . It just happens  --  you say you 're intellectual , but this shows exactly how intellectual you are  --  it just happens , if you ever read anything about science , that you might know that Dr. Frothinghope is a very important arch  --  logist . Dr. Frothinghope is a very old friend of mine . " " How old ? " I asked . " Sixty-two ? " Bella smiled at me sunnily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a good deal better-looking than you , darling . He 's leading an expedition down into the interior of Guatemala to uncover a lost Maya city and to reconstruct a snake goddess pyramid . Funnily enough , he asked me to join the expedition . " " In what capacity ? " I asked . " Someday , darling , " said Bella , " someone is going to wash your mouth out with soap and water . It just happens that Dr. Frothinghopehas been interested in my drawings . " " Etchings ? " I inquired . " Oh hell , " said Bella , " there 's no use my wasting my time trying to be serious with any of you . Dr. Frothinghope said I could learn the ropes very quickly . I 'm strong , a good deal stronger than you , darling , and I guess I could stand Guatemala a good deal better118than you could . At any rate , it would get me away from all of this . I 'd be doing something . " There was no use answering if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonably sure that Dr. Wilbur Frothinghope was either a figment of Bella 's imagination or a big name which she had heard mentioned and which she was now adding to her collectionof other important names . I3ella was revelling verbally in her world of make-believe . " Well , I 'd go if I were you , " I said . But Bella was no longer interested . She had probably tried out the idea to see how it would work at the Jaeckels ' at dinner , and she had already given it up as unsuccessful . " Darling , " she said , " what are you going to say to Joe ? " Ever since the telephone had rung the subject was obviously bound to come up , and now I was only thankful that it had not come up sooner . It would take only fifteen minutes to get to the Jaeckels ' if I stepped on the gas ; then I would be rid of her for a little while at any rate . After that she could project her personality anywhere she liked . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could shoot big game in Zambezi , or die of alcoholic poisoning , or get arrested . " How do you mean , " I asked , " what I 'm going to say to Joe ? " " I mean about me , " said Bella . " There probably wo n't be anything about you , " I answered . Bella smiled in complacent negation . " Oh yes , there will , " she said . " He 'll ask about me , and you know it , not that I care , because I can see him myself . He always talks about me when he gets drunk at the club . " I felt a tingle of anger . There was nothing she would have liked better than to make me angry . She was just getting herself set for a good scene , in which we could shout at each other and tell each other plain home truths , and which might end by her endeavoring to slap my face . " Who told you that ? " I asked . I19 " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is such a thing as being loyal , darling . " " Meaning me ? " I asked . Bella took her lipstick from her bag and opened her compact again . " Yes , meaning you , " she said . " You 're almost bright sometimes , darling . After the . way he treated me , how ( 10 you think it looks to have you , one of my own relatives , playing around with him , getting drunk with him , probably talking obscenities ? I ask you  --  how do you think it looks ? " " Well , " I said , " how did he treat you ? " " You 're not being either scintillating or funny . darling , " Bella said . " Everybody else knows how he treated me if you do n't . How do you think it feels to be abandoned by a man who has taken the best years of your life ? That 's what he did , the best years , when I might have meant something to somebody . If he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything he wanted  --  I might have been  --  " She paused and snapped her compact case shut . " Yes , " I said , " you might have . " I felt sad and angry almost at the same time , because what she said was partially true . There was sometimes truth in her most brazen prevarications . I believed that it had been more of a blow to her pride than anything else , and it still hurt her pride . The little sneer at the corner of her mouth showed it , and the extra sharpness of her overpowdered nose . " Oh , I 've been over the jumps , " Bella said . " I 'm not complaining , but there are ways of doing everything . There are ways of being a gentleman . " The Brills had always considered themselves experts on gentility , and judges of a court of honor . I could not sit there and take it , and certainly she knew I could n't . " He 's the nearest you ever came to seeing one , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darling ? " said Bella . " Well , he 's not , and noI20one else thinks he is either . The least thing a gentleman can do is to see that his former wife is n't starving when he 's making a hundred and fifty thousand a year . " " You 've never missed a meal , honey bee , " I said . " It is n't his fault I have n't , " Bella answered . She was back on the subject of alimony ; it was always a sore point with Bella . We had been over the subject before , but we went over it again . " You said you did n't want any , " I told her . " You kept saying it to the lawyers all the time . " " He was n't earning anything then , " said Bella , " but he would do something now if he were a gentleman . If you had any family loyalty you 'd ask him . How could I guess that he 'd be successful ? And now I have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like it to have people know that you see him after what he 's done to me ? " I spoke slowly and carefully . We had almost reached the North Shore by then . " Joe 's been a friend of mine for quite a while , " I said , " and he 's going to keep on being one , and you 're not going to stop it , honey bee . So just forget about Joe . He took a beating when he was with you , and he 's well out of it , and he knows it . " Bella was no longer beautiful . Her mouth worked as though she were chewing on something . " Excuse me , darling , " she said . " I forgot that you understood men better than women . That 's the trouble with you and Joe . You neither of you are very good with women , arc you ? Why not confess it ? When you see Joe you tell him from me that I 'm well out of it , too . Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him  --  " She told me what I was to tell Joe in a harsh , parched voice . It sounded a good deal like a page from a book which comes to you in the mail in a plain wrapper . She told me a good many things about Joe which she had told me before . I listened while I drove the car . The whole thing made me sick and she would be ashamedI2Iof herself when it was all over . Her voice went on against my silence and finally died away . " Jim , " she said at length . " What ? " I said . " I 'm sorry , Jim . I do n't know what gets into me sometimes . " " That 's all right , " I said . " Skip it . We 're getting to the Jaeckels ' now . " " Jim , " she said , and I asked her what she wanted . " Do you think Joe still loves me ? " There was an innocent enormity to the question . She was looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be reassured of an obvious fact . All her venom had left her . She had found release in that burst of words . " Skip it , " I said , " honey bee . Here 's the Jaeckels ' driveway . " She put an arm around my shoulders . " Darling , " she said , " you 're awfully sweet . There 's no one as sweet as you . " The funny thing was that I believe she meant it . The fine blue gravel of the Jaeckels ' driveway was crunching beneath the tires . The white house which the Jaeckels had rented from somebody in Boston was standing on the cliffs . There were people on the terrace which looked out on the little islands . There was a cool salt breath of rockweed and the sea . We had both awakened from an unpleasant dream . She was Bella Brill again , one of those delightful Brills who knew everybody , and I was Jim Calder , that amusing cousin of the Brills . She was Bella Brill , ready to spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was waving to someone on the terrace . " Susie , " she was calling , " Susie darling ! " She was going to have such a lovely time . There would be maids , bathrooms , speedboats . A houseman was coming already to get her hatbox . Bella was still waving . She was like the girl in the advertisements for high-powered automobiles , one of those automobilesfor which the young couple has waited for years , havingI22put up with countless little privations to acquire it . My car was the only contradiction to the picture , but Bella was doing her best . " Susie , " she called , " Susie darling ! " Bella Brill was getting off at the Jaeckels ' and thank God for it ! I should be getting away from the Jaeckels ' in just a minute , but it would take a good many hours to recover from that talk with Bella . I was wondering if one loved more or quarreled more in automobiles . The statistics would be interesting . It was just possible , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unimaginative layout were just what Bella had always wanted . She may have wanted all those people and the ease of it and the sense of escape , so like the life on the Queen Mary or at a resort hotel . There were so many things you could do at the Jaeckels ' that you did n't have to worry your head for a single minute . There were boats , swimming , badminton , croquet , and a lot of inflated ducks and seahorses which you could try to ride upon in the swimming pool . If these did n't work there was America 's new gift to the world , the downstairs game room , equipped with a real bar which had lots of comic signs behind it about the " Ladies ' Entrance " and " Spitting on the floor . . . " and all those games where you pushed a little ball with a plunger and watched it go into little holes guarded by nails . A lot of people could spend their winters doing that , and Tom and Susie Jaeckel did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got down there he was too tired to try . Bella could have it all if she wanted . It was certainly a long , long jump from Wickford Point . The Jaeckels had been working for a good many seasons to get into the Beach Club , and they had n't made it yet , and now Susie Jaeckel said she liked it here because you did n't have to mix with the summer colony ; you could just see your friends without havinga lot of stuffed-shirt strangers butting in . She and Tom just lived quietly , she now explained , and had their own friends to visit . Almost before the car had stopped Susie Jaeckel and Bella had123collided in an attitude of extreme affection . Susie Jaeckel was in tennis shorts . She was a type that would have done better in something else because she was overweight . If I had beer a doctor , I should have investigated her thyroid . " Oh , sweetness , " Susie said to Bella , " sweetness ! " Then she saw me and the expression in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been after Bella to get me down sometime . I was a feeble link , but I might con- ceivably lead to some of the right people at the Beach Club . " Sweetness , " Susie Jaeckel cooed , " ( lid you bring Mr. Calder down ? " " It 's just the other way around , Mrs. Jaeckel , " I said . " I brought sweetness here on my way to Boston . I 'm afraid I 'll have to push right on . Have you got everything out of the car , sweetness ? " " He 's always making fun because 1 drop things , " Bella said . " But you 'll stay for a Martini , wo n't you ? " Mrs. Jaeckel said . " Just something to keep you company on that long ride alone  --  Judson 's bringing them out right now , and we just must have somebody to help us eat all that caviar . " I was succumbing against my will to the material charm of the place . Bella had clamped herself firmly on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into my coat . " Of course he will , darling , " she said . " 1 is is n't in any hurry at all . " Then just as we reached the terrace and as the voices of the Jaeckels ' other guests rose to meet us , she had time to whisper to me poisonously :  --  " Do n't be so God-damned snobbish . Do n't try to snoot Sue Jaeckel . She can do a lot for you . " I wanted to ask what Sue could do , whether it was of a physical , a mental , or a moral nature , but there was no time ; we were on the terrace and Bella had already left Inc . She was being very charming , exchanging greetings and osculations with all sorts of people , both male and female . I did not know them , but they all looked healthy and they were very , very carefully dressed . 124 Tom Jaeckel had on brown doeskin trousers and a doublebreastedcoat of an even richer autumnal shade , which was buttonedtight over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flattish nose made one think of a prize fighter , and he had a quick springy walk , which indicated that he was fast on his feet . There was no funny business about Tom Jaeckel . He was the general manager of the eastern division of one of the biggest motor companies in the country . He was an executive who could handle personnel . I was glad that I was not among the personnel he handled . " Hello , Calder , " he said . " Glad to see you aboard . " The hearty phrase did n't go so badly with him either . " Hello , Jaeckel , " I said . I rather liked him . At any rate he worked for what he had , and he was paying for the party . " Judson , " Jaeckel called . " Gangway for Judson . " The butler in a cutaway came , with a cold Martini on a silver tray . He was a dignified man past middle age , the sort with whom you might shake hands by mistake  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered Judson . I had not seen him for twenty years . " Are you Judson who used to be at the Standishes ' ? " I asked . He knew me right away and he seemed both glad and surprised to see me . " Yes , Mr. Calder , " he said . " Mr. Standish was a very fine employer , sir . " I looked across the terrace and back at Judson . We offered each other a wordless explanation for being at the Jacckels ' . The man 's face was as impassive and distinguished as the face of an elder statesman . He was looking tolerantly upon the scene , untouched by it and not amused . The caviar rested upon cakes of ice and beside the table I saw Mr. Howard Berg . He had finished his caviar and toast and was rubbing his fingers carefully on a napkin . I never had paid much attention to Mr. Berg until that moment , for it was always easier125to avoid Bella 's friends as much as possible , but now he rather puzzled me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed to be quite right . He wore white shoes , white doeskins , and a double-breasted blue serge coat with a white handkerchief jutting out a trifle too far from his breast pocket . The lapels of the coat were a shade too sharply pointed . His face was dark , as I had remembered it , and his hair was as shiny as patent leather , but he did not look like a tango dancer or a gigolo , nor did he look like a playboy . " Hello , " I said . His greeting showed that he was trying to he cordial and to indicatethat any relative of Bella 's was a friend of his . " Swell to see you here , " he said . It occurred to me that my previous estimate of him had been wrong . He did not look like a man who would leave unpaid bills behind him , but after a few amenities 1 took the matter up . " I just stopped at the garage on the main road , " I said . " The man there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks you may have forgotten it . You know how those people are , just two jumps ahead of the sheriff . " Mr. Berg looked concerned and he looked at me carefully for a moment before he answered . " That bill was paid on the first of the month , " he said . " If you give me the name and address I 'll send out another check tonight . " He took out a small notebook and a gold pencil and I gave him the name and address . " Thanks for telling me , " Berg said . " I do n't like things like that . " He paused . His eyes , I noticed , were a yellow brown . His voice was modulated without being well-bred . It possessed an excess smoothness reminiscent of his pointed lapels , and of his exquisitely folded handkerchief . " Please get this , " he went on . " I pay my bills . I pay them promptly always . " I got it  --  that and a good deal more . He was younger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew very little , but126he was stating a definite fact , confident of my understanding and acceptance . He meant he was not the kind who could afford to let bills go , not even little bills . " Then you have n't minded my bringing it up ? " I said . " No , " said Berg . " I appreciate it , really . " It is hard to understand what a woman sees in a man , because she almost always sees something that a man does n't . What Bella saw in most of her boy friends was even more mysterious , but I could guess what her interest was in this one . He must have appealed to her sense of recklessness ; he must have appealed to her curiosity , for it was hard not to wonder what he had been , what he had seen , where he had come from . He still stood near me as if he were as interested in me as I was in him , or else he did not want to give the impression of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , evidently preferring that I should do the talking . " Bella says you work in New York , " I said . I was sorry as soon as I had spoken . It sounded as if I took , in the capacity of Bella 's relation , an interest in his prospects . " That 's right , " he answered , and he gave a firm name which sounded like a brokerage house . He even added a further explanation :  --  " Business is pretty slack in summer , that 's why I 'm here so much . I hope you 're staying overnight . " " I 'm not , " I said . " I 'm going on . Sorry , I 'd like to see more of you . " Mr. Berg smiled pleasantly . There was n't really anything the matter with him except that everything was a little unfamiliar . " Sorry too , " he said . " We might have had some bridge . " " You 'd be too good for me , " I answered . " Oh no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just that . Swell to have seen you . " It was n't swell to have seen him , but he was interesting , new . When I found Bella her voice indicated that she was finishingI27her third cocktail and that she was having a wonderful time . I put my hand around her thin bare arm and drew her a step or two away from the group which she had been entertaining . " I 'm going now , sweetness , " I said . " I 've just been eating caviar with Berg . " " Jim , " said Bella . " What did you say to him ? " It really seemed as though she might be frightened . " I was wrong about him , " I said . " The Bergs always pay their debts , but I 'd look out for that boy , sweetness . Watch yourself . " She wrenched her arm out of my hand , but when I was a step or two away she ran after me . " Jim , " she said , " if I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get you on the telephone ? " Her voice was a little breathless ; she really wanted to know . " Oh , " I said , " afraid you 're going to get into a jam ? " " No , " she said , " of course not . " The complete candor of her answer told me that she was not telling the whole truth , and it came over me that she had not been natural all day in a good many little ways . " Listen , " I said , " are you up to something , Belle ? " " Why , no , " she answered . " What a silly question ! " And then she added before I could speak : " What makes you ask ? " " Because you said , " I answered , " that you could n't go on like this . " She hesitated a moment , and then she laughed . " But , darling , " she told me , " I say that all the time . " " It would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Joe Stowe ? " I asked her . " You have such a funny imagination when you have a drink , " she said . " You would n't want to know where you could get me , unless you thought you might want me , " I said . " You 'd better tell me , Belle . " " I do n't see why it is , " she answered , " that you keep trying toI28make something out of nothing . I do n't ask you any questions . You can get away with anything . " " All right , " I said . " I 'll be at Stanhope 's office tomorrow and the next day and perhaps the next . I 'd be careful , honey bee . " " Oh , be careful yourself , " she answered . " I know why you 're going to New York . " I knew that there was no use talking to her . In her present mood it would only be a waste of time , and besides I was glad to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , " I said , " and take a little solid food before you have any more Martinis . " I29XIIAutograph , Mr. Stowe ? When I turned left onto Beacon Street it was six-thirty in the evening , the end of a hot and sultry day . The Common was crowded with people , mostly men in shirt sleeves stretched out prone on newspapers . The fountain in the Frog Pond was turned on strong , and its basin was full of children whose cries drowned out the noise of the traffic and rose into the air with a sound similar to the chatter of blackbirds over Wickford Point . The marble wings attached to the red brick of the State House presentedthe only incongruous note . The rest was the way it should have been , even to the planting of the Public Garden . I left my car and ignition key with the perspiring , gold-braided doorman at the Crofton . I never knew what he did with cars , because there was never any place to park them . Although the Crofton had been built for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no good reason , the impression of being garishly new . It was possible to converse with the headwaiter in French , and dazed Continentalswho found themselves in Boston made for it at once . So did everyone in the show business , and in fact everyone of importancefrom anywhere . This gave the lobby a certain distinction , and probably for that reason Harvard boys and debutantes liked to use the bar , and you could almost always see something strikingand unexpected in the dining room . Joe Stowe had been given a bedroom and sitting room especially designed for celebrities . It looked very much like the setting for that play of Benelli 's in which the Barrymore boys had once acted130  --  " The Jest . " There was a Renaissance fireplace , a refectory table along the wall , copies of del Sarto , and some brand-new Renaissancefurniture . There were also some upholstered chairs and a sofa , so that you did not have to use the others . Joe Stowe was lying on the sofa in his underwear ; he got up when I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hottest day he never appeared to lose his nervous energy . No matter how tired he was , his mind was always restlessly active , and no matter where one saw him he had a capacity for being the same . " Take off your coat , " Joe said . " What 's been keeping you so long ? I 've been waiting for you in this goddam museum nearly three hours . A little squirt from the publisher 's has been up here talking to me . They 're sending him with me to Vermont to-morrow . " " Who was he ? " I asked . Joe ran his stubby fingers through his sandy hair . His face was shining with perspiration so that little highlights glanced off his forehead and his cheekbones . I remembered what Cousin Clothilde had said about it once  --  an undistinguished face . The mouth was too large and the nose was too small and the greenish-yellow eyes were deep-set , but all the features came together when he grinned . His expression gave no immediate indication that he was a sensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How should I know who he was ? He 's just one of those boys that all the publishers send out  --  one of those parasites who batten on you and me . They all look alike and they all dress alike and they all feed you a free meal and introduce you to somebody else . " " Well , do n't get sore at him , " I said . " He has to earn his living . " Joe walked over to the refectory table , fished for an ice cube floating in a watery bowl , weighed it between his fingers and dropped it back again because there was not enough to it to cool a drink . " There 's one thing , " said Joe . " I can tell them what I think of131them right now , and they all come back for more . By God , they ought all to be drowned ! " He had not been drinking ; he was simply experimenting with his blood pressure . It seemed curious to me that he never lost his capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy about something . Sometimes he got himself so mixed up that he was both things at once , and now he was dealing with a subject which was particularly dear to him , because many people in the past had taken advantage of him , and he hated all the business details of his life . He gave his shoulders another shrug as though an unseen hand had pushed him in the face . " If everybody would just get together and he like me , " Joe said , " we might all get along . The trouble with this country is that the producers are being sucked dry by the nonproductive class . For everyone who does something there are twenty who live off it . They 're like the boy in the men 's room who runs a little water and gives you a towel and then wants a dime . I say to hell with the whole lot of them . To hell with the dramatic agents and the literary agents and the moving picture agents and the publishers ' agents . What I want is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work if they keep after you all the time ? " He did n't mean half of what he said . It was only that he liked to hear himself talk . It gave him some sort of release , and he knew it was perfectly safe to talk to me since I knew what he meant and what he did n't . Something else was going on in his mind . He had a way of working at two things at once . " What did he do to you ? " I asked . Joe was pacing barefooted up and down the carpet . " I 'll tell you what he did , " Joe said , " he damn near got me to write a book . He got me talking and he caught me with my intellectualpants down . " " Is that why you have n't got any on ? " I asked . " You know what they do , " Joe said . " They always have some idea for a book that they want somebody to write . It 's always some132piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before I knew it , I got interested , and the next thing  --  do you know what he wanted me to do ? " " No , " I said . " Well , " Joe said , " those books are always about America . Their minds do n't work any further than that . It 's always something about feeling the pulse of America from another point of view . You know what I mean . You know what they do . They take some Englishman usually , who ca n't get along at home . If they ca n't get an Englishman , they sandbag somebody else , and they send him across the continent on roller skates or in a balloon or submarine , so that he will get a new and interesting perspective and find out what the farmers in the Dust Bowl arc thinking about . How do they know that anybody thinks ? This time it was about the share-croppers . " " That 's very , very timely , " I said . I was glad to be back with Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was nice to talk to someone who thought the same way you did . Writers are a very lonely lot , who generally ca n't get on well with each other beyond a certain point . " Do you know what he almost did ? " said Joe . " He almost got me down there in a trailer . He had the papers right out on the table . You 've got to be careful of those boys . Once when I woke up in the morning I found I had to write the life of Calhoun , and once I nearly had to do a. life of Henry Clay Frick  --  remember ? " I told him I remembered . Then Joe thought of something else , and he began to scowl . " What made you tell that big poop Allen Southby that I was here ? " he asked . " Do n't you know that I always try to go through town without seeing him ? " " I thought he was a friend of yours , " I said . " Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ? He wrote The Transcendent Curve . " Joe made a coarse uncomplimentary sound. 133 " It does n't pay to be jealous , Joe , " I said . " He 's written a great book , a fine book . Beneath his pen the glamorous panorama of American thought moves in a scintillating progress . " He made another vulgar sound before I had finished . A lot of people had begun to be afraid of Joe . " Now that you 've brought up that point , " Joe said , " let 's admit I have to spend a lot of time not being jealous of other people . I 'm pretty sick of being big-hearted , but just let me tell you I 'm really not jealous of Southby , so now I have to prove I 'm not jealous of him . He 's asked us both out there to dinner and we have to go . Actually I pity him . I hope you understand . " " I understand . I pity him too , " I said . We both knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we could have done a good deal better than Allen Southby , given his opportunities . Yet there was no real reason for Joe to have been exercised about Southby , for Joe had had the reviewers eating out of his hand ever since the success of his last two books . As I sat there looking at him in his undershirt and plum-colored shorts , I recalled what one of our most valued critics had written of his recent work . " It is doubtful , " he had written , " whether any living writer in English can equal Mr. Stowe as a master of prose . One must turn back far , and perhaps in vain , to match the sensitiveness of his ear . " You might have thought that he was ashamed of that ability of his , for he had spent most of his life trying to hide it , except when he was writing , just as he tried to hide his gentleness and compassion . Any mention of his style made him mad . He said that he hated literary style and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , " Joe said , " we have to spoil a perfectly good evening to show that we are n't jealous . You want to take a shower ? I 'm going to take a shower . Well , anyway come on in and talk to me . " I followed him into a Louis Seize bedroom , where he took off his shorts and shirt . He was puffy around the eyes , but his body was very thin , almost emaciated , as it always had been . I saw the134white welt of a scar on his right shoulder and I remembered where he got it . He was already in the tub behind the shower curtains before I spoke again . The cold water had just hit him . " Jesus ! " he exclaimed . " It wo n't be so bad at Allen 's , " I said . " Maybe Allen did n't tell you . He 's writing a novel . " Joe stepped out of the bathroom with a towel in his hand . He came into the bedroom dripping wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that , " he said . " Are you sure he 's writing a novel ? " " He let me read some of it , " I said , " and he 's certainly going to let us read some more of it tonight . Wait till you see it , Joe . It 's terrible . " But Joe still looked worried . " How do you know it 's rotten , Jim ? " he asked . " What 's it about ? " His forehead was wrinkled ; his eyes were anxious . " He let me read the first chapters , " I said , " about two weeks ago . It 's a New England ' novel , the strong , fearless kind , lusty and robust . The hero belches on the first page . " Joe 's reaction was unexpected ; he still was looking serious . " And you say it 's rotten ? " he inquired . " It 's worse than that , Joe , " I said . " Just try to imagine Allen Southby trying and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head and began pulling clean linen out of his bag . As he did so , his hairbrushes and some tooth paste fell on the floor , but he did not pick them up . " You ca n't tell about those things , " he said . " It 's just possible . . . it 's just the sort of thing that might happen . It might be good . " I knew why he was serious then . I felt an actual twinge of something that was almost fear . " Now listen , " I said , " it ca n't be good . " My voice was almost pleading . " You ca n't tell , Jim , " Joe answered . " If it were a short story , it would have to be bad because you ca n't make mistakes in a short135story . But with a novel you can do the most awful things and still get somewhere , and this talk about lusty robust work frightens me . Right now , if something is lusty and robust enough , almost anything is excused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , " I said . " The hero has a sensation in his belly . " Joe was tying a washable , light-colored necktie . " It might just be that it 's good , " he repeated . " Think of all the good novels that are written by people who have never written anything before . Think of all the new talent that wins the publishers ' Prize Contests every year . Think of all the frustrated schoolteachers and the sand-hogs and the policemen who write good novels . " " Allen is n't frustrated , " I said . " I know , " said Joe . " It 's a good thing that he is n't frustrated  --  but still you ca n't be sure . He may be writing a good novel , and if he does I do n't think I can stand it . Ile has n't done anything to deserve it . He is n't even bright ; but he 's just the sort of person who might do it . " " You wait till you see it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . It 's about the Wickford Valley . " Joe looked startled . " Has he done that ? " he said . " I was going to write about the Wickford Valley myself . " " As a matter of fact I was thinking about it too , " I said . It was the first time that he had alluded to Wickford Point , and even the allusion had done something to him . Of course the subject was bound to come up , but I did not like to talk to him about Wickford Point . It gave me a feeling of divided loyalty . Joe straightened his coat and looked at himself in the mirror . Both Sidney and Harry had always given a great deal of thought to clothes . When those two got together and there was no immediatefamily crisis , they could spend hours discussing tweeds and the cut of lapels or discoursing on overtailored coats . They sounded almost like the page in the theater program which you read between the acts when every effort at conversation has failed . I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wore themselves . I gathered that they felt personally freed from these sartorial shackles , because they were the Brills and becauseeverybody knew that they were the Brills . Nevertheless the fact remained that Sidney and Harry felt themselves authorities upon clothes , and they had always agreed that Joe 's taste in dress was not good . More recently they enlarged on the subject and said that his taste in dress was just what you would expect considering what he was . Personally I thought that Joe looked rather well that evening in his tropical suit and Panama . It was true that his ties and his socks did not fit into any particular color scheme , but he looked better than anyone I had seen at the Jaeckels ' . As we descended in the elevator , which always seemed to carry , along with its passengers , the faint perfume of a beauty parlor , Joe made a suggestion :  --  " Perhaps we ought to have a drink before we start , " he said . " Then Southby 's cocktails wo n't taste so had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the neighborhood of the hotel desk . The house detective near the elevator nodded to him . " Everything all right , Mr. Stowe ? " he asked . " Nobody 's got in there yet , Ed , " Joe answered . The house detective looked happy . A member of the managerial staff bowed and said : " Good evening , Mr. Stowe . " A boy with a pimply face , who had been sitting under a potted palm , got up so quickly that he mingled with the palm leaves . " Mr. Stowe , " he said . " Yes , " said Joe . " I 've been waiting to speak to you , Mr. Stowe , " he said . " I 'm the literary editor of the East Boston High School Magazine . Could you give me an interview , just for a minute , Mr. Stowe ? " There was no necessity to be nice , but Joe was nice to him . " All right , " he said . " They told me you were here and I forgot136 r37about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It never pays to offend the press . What do you want ? I 'll give you just three minutes . " They walked away into a corner behind the palms while I stood and watched . " What is your favorite hobby , sir ? " the East Boston High School editor was asking and I heard Joe answering similar questions without any display of rancor . " They told me I could n't get an interview , sir , " the boy said . " Well , you did , " said Joe , " an exclusive interview . " Behind me I heard someone else speaking . " It 's Mr. Stowe , " someone was saying , and someone else said : " He looks just like Sinclair Lewis . " I told him about it when we got to the bar , because I thought it might amuse him , but it did n't . " I do n't look like Red Lewis at all , " he said . " Do you think I look like Red ? " The radio was going in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing drinks and potato chips and bowls of popcorn . I was thinking of other Boston barrooms which had existed before it was customary for women to frequent them  --  the outlets of another lustier age , when the barkeeper always asked us if we were sure we were twenty-one . It had been a long while since anyone had asked that question . Joe remembered those times too , but his mind was on the present . He was interested in the bar attendants and their monkey jackets . They reminded him of a recipe that I ) . H. Lawrence had given for making the world better , in Lady Chatterley 's Lover . Lawrence 's hero had said that humanity would be much improvedif all men would wear short jackets and tight breeches . Joe could not remember why this would make the world better , but he pointed out that here we were in a laboratory where this was being tried and that still the world seemed to be about the same . " No , " I said , " it 's better than it used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " it is n't . It 's absolutely the same . " " Just ask yourself , " I suggested . " Are n't you better off than you were three years ago ? " As soon as I had spoken I was sorry , for I was bringing up again something which I had not wanted to mention . Joe looked grim and he had forgotten about Lady Chatterley 's Lover . " You 're damned well right I 'm better off , " he answered . " It 's like being out of prison . It 's like being alive again . I 'm sorry , I did n't mean to say it quite that way , but you know what I mean . " I knew exactly what he meant , and he meant a good deal more than he said . " All right , " I said . " Go ahead and say it . " " All right , " said Joe . " To hell with the Brills ! I still feel that way . " Before I answered , he gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed . " They tried to ruin me , " he said . " They tried to take out my heart and lungs and liver and stuff me with sawdust . " " They did n't mean to do that , " I said . " They could n't help it , Joe . " It was not the place to develop the matter further , over gin cocktails and potato chips with the radio playing swing selections . You would have to go back to Wickford Point ; you would have to go back to all sorts of checks and balances to explain it , and at any rate Joe 's answer interrupted me . " The hell they could n't help it , " he said . There was no use going on with it . " Cousin Clothilde told me to give you her love , " I said . Joe 's expression changed and for the moment he did not look angry . " Jim , " he said , " I wish I did n't keep worrying about Bella every now and then . " 139XIIIOf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the ride to Cambridge would not be agreeable , and I began to pity myself as I faced it . It seemed to me that I was always finding myself , through no fault of my own , the arbiter of other people 's difficulties . First Bella had sat beside me in the car , and no sooner was the seat vacant than there was Joe Stowe . I had never intended my car to become the sanctum of a psychoanalyst , and neither Joe nor Bella paid me twenty-five dollars an hour to listen to their naive confessions . " So you say they could n't have helped it ? " Joe said . " You know damn well they could have helped it . I 've heard you say so yourself . You said I had a rotten deal " " But they could n't have , " I repeated . " It was a matter of survival , Joe . It was either you or they . They had to make you one of them or they could n't have existed . " " Hogwash , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regretted his outburst . " When I think back , " he said , " it seems to me that I leaned over backwards to be considerate . I 'm able to get on with people . I have a certain amount of sense . " " Cousin Clothilde sent you her love , " I said again . " Did she ? " said Joe . " She never means anything she says , unless it 's about herself . There 's no relying on what any of them say . They 'll talk themselves out of anything and you know it . " " I do n't agree with you , " I said . " Let 's skip it , Joe . " Joe 's head moved toward me quickly and I knew he was looking at me to determine how I felt . " All right , " he said . " I 'm sorry , Jim . " " Then do n't go sounding off to me , " I said . " They 're relatives of mine . " " All right , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sky was growing red with the sunset , which meant another hot day tomorrow . It made me think of the old couplet : " Red sky at night , sailor 's delight . " Perhaps I did not like the look of it because I was not a sailor . For me the red sky simply reflected mugginess and mental discontent . The traffic was very heavy on Commonwealth Avenue , and they were doing something to the street near the offices of the National Casket Company . I wondered if the time would come when all the facades of Commonwealth Avenue would conceal schools and businesses and doctors ' offices . Certainly everything was changing fast . Business might be on the rocks , but everyone had some sort of car , and everyone was trying to get out of town as anxiously as though beating a retreat beforean invading army . We crawled along Bay State Road and neither Joe nor I spoke , until we reached the new drive by the river , where we could see some small boats sailing and Harvard summer students rowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well have been speaking ; we both were thinking the same disturbed thoughts . We were both back at Wickford Point . " Do you remember old Beaver ? " Joe asked . " Yes , " I said . " Do n't bring him up . " He was referring to old John Brill , of course . " Well , I do n't have to have him with my meals any more , " Joe said . " Thank God , I do n't have to go to bed with him either . " " But you ca n't stop talking about him , " I said . " Now go ahead and stop . " " Well , " said Joe , " you never liked him . Just do n't be sanctimonious , that 's all I ask . " " Do n't be a goddam bore , " I said . " You 've done everything you could about old Brill . " " Poopsy-woopsy , " Joe said , and then was silent for a while. 140 141 " Jim , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were stopping at a traffic light by one of the bridges . " Not that I give a damn , but how 's Bella ? " It was needlessly elaborate . He gave more than a damn and we both knew it . " Bella 's fine , " I said . " I just left her with some people by the name of Jaeckel . She 's planning to go to Guatemala on a scientific expedition with a man named Dr. Frothinghope . " Joe grinned . " You must have made her sore , " he said . " When she 's sore she always thinks up a scientific expedition . Once she was going with Byrd to the South Pole . That was the night I told her she was knock-kneed . " " Well , " I said , " she is n't . " " No , " said Joe , " that 's true , she is n't . I hope she 's got some new boy friends . " " There 's one at the Jaeckels ' now , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine , " said Joe . " I hope she 's having a good time , but God help Mr. Berg . What 's he like ? " " He always pays his debts , " I said . " Jim , " he said , " have you ever thought  --  " He paused and looked across the river . " Thought what ? " I asked . " Have you ever thought that Bella might kill herself ? " I jammed my foot on the accelerator by mistake , and began to laugh . " It is n't anything to laugh at , " Joe said . " What do you think 's so funny about it ? " " Do n't worry , she wo n't kill herself , " I said . It was funny because everyone at Wickford Point occasionally discussed doing away with himself or herself . " She might , you know , " Joe said . The remark was not worth answering . Joe cleared his throat again . " Is she happy , Jim ? " he asked . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she always was . " " Well , that does n't mean anything , " Joe said . " Has she enough money ? " I drove the car over to the curb and stopped it . We were right in front of the Harvard Business School with a fine view of the new Houses across the river . I turned around so that I could look at Joe . " Say , " said Joe , " what 's the matter ? " " I 'll tell you what 's the matter , " I said . " You 've got away from Bella and you 'd better keep away . Now do n't start getting soft . You 're not to write to Bella , you 're not to telephone her or see her . You 're not to get mixed up in that again . If you do , it will only mean that she 'll get into you for something , and everything will start all over . Bella 's all right . She is n't going to kill herself , and she never gave a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't give a damn for anything ; she is n't made that way . She ca n't take time out caring for anybody because she has too much trouble looking out for herself . You 're out of it , do you understand ? All you have to do is forget about her . " " You need n't be so rough on her , " Joe said . " If you wo n't stand up for Bella , I will . " " Do n't you worry , " I told him . " There 's always going to be someone who 's going to stand up for Bella . You 're out of it . If she ever calls you up , do n't answer . If you ever see her , cross the street . " Joe looked at me for a while before he answered , and I was pleased to see that his face had lost its generous expression . " All right , " he said , " I 'm out of it , but is there anything I can do ? She never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's nothing you can do , " I said . " If anybody has to look out for Bella , I will . " " Oh hell , " said Joe , " all right . " " Now that we have that straight , " I said , " we are going to cross the Larz Anderson bridge and have a nice dinner with our old friend , Dr. Allen Southby. " 142 143Joe looked brighter . He was coping with a new idea . " Do you really think he 'll show us that novel ? " he said . " He 'll certainly show it to us , " I said , " because that 's what we'rehere for . " " I would n't mind if you wrote a good novel , " Joe said . " You 're probably too old and you may have done magazine stuff too long , but I honestly would n't mind . And I would n't say that to anyone else , Jim , either . " " Thanks , " I said , " that 's handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's the matter now ? " I asked . " I was just thinking , " Joe said , and he laughed again . " Well , go ahead , " I said , " if it 's so funny . " " I was just thinking , " Joe said , " Bella always goes for phony intellectuals . How it would be if she got hold of Southby ? " " Do n't be too hard on Allen , Joe , " I answered . " Make a wax image of him and stick needles in him , but do n't be too hard . " Joe rubbed his hand over the back of his head . " Jim , " he said , " it might have been all right . " " What might have been ? " I asked . " Bella and me , " he said . " If things had just been a little different here and there  --  if we 'd both tried harder  --  it might have been all right . " I turned toward him quickly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We all get exactly what 's coming to us . You ought to know by this time that there is no such thing as might-have-been : It would always be the same . " I had not intended to speak so frankly , but I knew Bella well enough to know that this was so . She ( lid not get along with Joe . And what was more , they would never get along , certainly not now after everything that had happened . I had heard each of them talk about it often enough , and each of them was entirely right according to personal standards , just as so many others to whom I had listened had been absolutely right when they discussed their144marital disagreements through a haze of liquor or through a mist of tears . There was a horrid similarity to all those fallings-out , and the most shocking thing was the final fact that people who had been together could never wholly escape from each other . They both knew too much . Each had an understanding of the other 's weaknesses which was uncanny in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reared to fight , no matter at what odds . If you once let them off the leash , they would cheerfullyface the prospect of inevitable destruction , and Joe and Bella were like that . They each knew how to appeal and how to hurt . They would start exactly where they had left off in the same grim struggle . It seemed incredible that Joe did not have the sense to realize it , because a good part of his life had been consumed in studying human values . He was like the psychiatrist who spends his days directing the lives of maladjusted patients , and then runs away with his office secretary and gets a divorce himself . Joe understood everybody except himself and Bella Brill . I knew it would be hours now before those two would leave my mind again . I was leaving them ; I was going to New York to attend to my own affairs , and I might even endeavor to enjoy myself ; but those two would keep coming into my consciousness , and they had no right to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in concentration camps where they can not disturb the rest of organized society . Joe seemed to have forgotten Bella again : he was examining all the new Houses along the river which formed the concrete basis of the Harvard House Plan . " What do you bet the students still never speak to each other ? " Joe said . " What do you bet they all go and eat at their clubs in spite of the House Plan ? What 's the matter with you , Jim ? You 're not sore at me , are you ? " " No , " I said . " Then do n't be so sour , " Joe said . " Dinner with Southby 's bad enough without your getting sour . " 145XIVEvening and the ArtsAfter many years of effort Joe had learned how to adjust his personality to circumstances . He had never liked Allen Southby much and recently had begun actively to dislike him , yet you would not have guessed it . He became almost charming when we reached the Master 's House . Allen was out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a gabardine coat . His graying , curly hair had just the proper wind-blown look , and he was smokinghis pipe , lighted , I suspected , just when he had seen us coming . Joe too had suddenly turned into a man of letters and they both were very , very gracious ; they exhibited pleasing mannersdeveloped from constant contact with other literary figures and from experience on lecture platforms . " It 's fine to see you , " Allen said , " absolutely swell . Come in . I 've got some cocktails in the study . " " I would n't have missed coming here for anything , " Joe said . " My sister 's away , " said Allen . " She always says I have my best times when she 's away . " " That means you 're working on something , " Joe said , and he smiled at Allen playfully . " I know you like to be alone when you 're working . " " Did Jim tell you ? " Allen asked . " He really should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell me , " Joe said . " After The Transcendent Curve everyone 's been waiting . You know the way rumors get146around . Everyone 's been saying it 's a novel . I hope you 're going to let us read it , Allen . " Allen 's expression became modest but delighted . " You really would n't mind looking at it , Joe ? " he asked . " Of course I was n't going to ask you , but if you really would n't mind . . . It 's the roughest sort of draft . " " I 've just been saying to Jim that I hoped you 'd let me see it , " Joe said . " That is , if it wo n't disturb you . " " As long as you realize it 's just a simple draft , " said Allen . " I should love to know if you think I have the right feel for the thing , if you think I have my teeth in it . Jim thinks so . Jim was a great help . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It could n't be as good as the beginning , " I said , " it simply could n't . " The glance that Allen gave me showed that he could swallow nearly anything . I almost felt ashamed of myself ; for after all I was his guest . " I 'm not sure , Jim , " he said . " I think perhaps that what I 've done since may be just a little better . I 'm in the swing of it now , going ahead full steam . I simply could n't stop now if I tried . It 's the first time I 've ever realized the lure of fiction . " " That 's right , " I said . " Do n't stop . You must n't stop . " " You need n't tell him , Jim , " Joe said . " He could n't stop , not if he feels that way . " Allen had led us into the pine-paneled study , where a pewter cocktail shaker and some small pewter cups stood on a tavern table before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his duties as the host who must say something gracious about each of his guests . " Let 's not talk about my struggles now , " he said . " You both know that sort of thing so well . Joe , we ought to get Jim to write a novel , should n't we ? I mean something really serious . He has it in him if he 'd try . " 147Joe looked at me complacently and back at Allen Southby and nodded in bland assent . " What 's more , " said Allen , " I have a bone to pick with Jim . Here I am writing about the Wickford Valley , and he never told me until the other night that he had any connection with it . I 've never seemed to associate Jim with it , but I always associated you , Joe . Sorry , old man , I did n't mean to bring that up . " " They have a dogs ' graveyard there , " said Joe . " You ought to see that graveyard . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his luminous eyes assumedan added brightness . " You do n't really mean it . That 's just the sort of odd bit I 'm looking for . Here I 've been sitting in this study , trying to recapture the spirit of that valley , and you two know it . Jim , you must promise to show me that graveyard . I can come down anytime . " I did not answer , and in any case he would not have given me the opportunity , for he had turned back again to Joe . " I do n't suppose you 've seen your mail for several days , " Allen said . " I do n't suppose you 've heard the news , Joe . " " What news ? " Joe asked . Allen set down his pipe on the table beside the cocktail shaker . " It 's safe to tell you . It 's all settled , " Allen said . " Your election has been ratified . I wish to welcome you in my position as an older but not as a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What institute ? " Joe asked . " The Institute of Arts and Letters , " Allen said . Joe lost a part of his poise . " Oh hell , " he said , " am I in that ? " " You certainly are , " said Allen , " and now as an older member , I want to drink your health . " " I did n't ask to be in it , did I ? " Joe said . Allen laughed agreeably . " No one has ever asked , " he explained . " It is an honor which 148is thrust upon one . " He lifted up the cocktail shaker and shook his head indulgently at his own forgetfulness . " I clean forgot about the ice , " he said . " Excuse me for just a minute , will you ? " Joe and I stood alone in the study against the background of Allen Southby 's books . The pewter in the old pine dresser shone vaguely in the waning light . We watched each other until we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then Joe made a face . " God-damned patronizing bastard , " Joe said . " How long do we have to sit here and see him throw his weight around ? " " Wait till you see the novel , " I said softly . Joe unbuttoned his jacket . He was examining the paneling and the books . " Do n't let 's speak about it , " he whispered . " It 's going to be good . I know it 's going to be good . " The cocktails were a credit to Allen in that they proved conclusivelythat he seldom drank them . He must have been aware himself of their deficiencies , for he came hack with a pewter mug when he brought the ice . " As you both know , my old love has always been ale , " he said . " I hope you 'll excuse me . Ale and a pipe are about as far as I 've ever gone . " " You would n't mind if I smoked a cigarette ? " Joe asked . Allen laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid or that you could make fun of him indefinitely . " Do n't jape at me , " Allen said . " You have the outside view of the academic life , but we 're really almost human here . " In a way he had put Joe in his place , and Allen was just as capable as Joe was . I grew more alive to this when we sat down to dinner in the Master 's dining room , which had been architecturallyprepared for the reception of an occasional distinguished guest who might be visiting the university . The food was brought in by an old Negro in a white coat . He was old Sam , Allen ex-14911plained to us , who was the steward at the Vindex Club during term time and who came to Allen in the summer . I had nearly forgotten the Vindex Club until Allen mentioned it . It was the undergraduate literary club , whose membership included all nice boys with literary pretensions . They went there to listen to the discussions of their betters , and to strain their minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was an undergraduate and he must have spent a lot of time there later , sitting at the head of the long table dispensing charm , or taking a staid part in the literary revels . He was a good host now , with a keen intuitive interest . For a while his talk went back , as it had the last time I had seen him , to Irish letters  --  the natural result of a previous vacation spent in the neighborhood of Dublin . There he had been received , apparently cordially , by all the figures of a literary world with which I was unfamiliar , but Joe knew them and Joe became interested . They talked for quite a while about the " Anglos " and about Glendalough , and about Yeats and the Abbey , and about the Gate . They also exchanged anecdotes concerning various characters whose names reminded one of controversies in American municipal politics . They talked through salmon and salad while I listened , half-admiring Allen Southby , and very nearly grateful for his hospitality ; and I thought how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's estimate of character . There was ample opportunity for a number of melancholythoughts while I listened . When you are young enough , I thought , all sorts of unrevealed possibilities make you a person , but afterwards when there are no more possibilities you become a type . Nearly every old man sitting about a club is a type that fits into a category as readily as a butterfly or a bee or a praying matis . Allen Southby was turning into a type and so was Joe Stowe . I wondered if I also were not slowly ceasing to be myself . Allen was really very nice  --  I gathered that Joe had begun to think so , too  --  until he got back to the subject of New England. 150Then there was something pretentious about him which definitely grated , for there he sat like a self-invited guest assuming that he was part of a family that was not his . He was pretending to be a native , dwelling on austerities and eccentricities . He was particularly bad when he got back to the dogs ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold apple pie and cream . ( " A real New England dish , " Allen explained . " I thought of having doughnuts , but that would be painting the lily , would n't it ? " ) He had stored Joe 's remark about the dogs ' graveyard carefully in his mind and now he wanted to hear all about it . It was rather skillfully done , I thought , for he obviously wished to reach a point where we must ask again to see his novel . When I told him some of the names and quoted from the inscriptions upon the little stones he laughed and laughed . He had a musical halfinfectiouslaugh , and he said it was all so typically New England . He was still talking of New England when he led us back to his study for coffee . His investigations had given him a fascinating store of reminiscence , and he had also acquired a lot of salty stories about small hamlets in Maine , the kind that deal with ship captains and with rustics sitting around the country store . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hinterland accent . He stuffed some aromatic tobacco in his pipe and offered us cigars , but he still went on talking while Joe encouragedhim with complimentary words . After a while Allen 's enthusiasm began to wane . He obviously wanted us to ask about the novel ; and though Joe must have known it , he never brought the subject up until Allen began to fidget in his chair . Joe was deliberately waiting for him to begin , and in a certain way it was not good manners . Then when the clock struck nine , Allen gave up . " Were you really serious , " he asked , " when you said you wanted to see this thing I 'm doing ? " " Why , see here , " Joe said , " I 've only been waiting for you to ask me again , and so has Jim . Have n't you , Jim ? " 151Allen Southby drew a deep breath and set down his pipe almostwith relief . " I really do want both of you to see it , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another soul except Martha . " " What did Martha say ? " I asked . Allen drew another deep breath and walked over to the drawer of his desk . " She felt the same way you did about it , Jim , " he said . " Well , that could n't have been better , " I told him , " and a woman 's reaction is always more important than a man 's . " Allen had produced the manuscript from the desk drawer . He held it with a studied carelessness in his hands . " You 're sure it is n't too much trouble ? " he said . When everything was said and done , Joe might talk a lot but he was never actively unkind . " No trouble at all , Allen , " he answered . " You understand it 's just a rough first draft , " Allen said . " I know Jim understands already . You wo n't be too hard on it ? " " Of course not , " said Joe . " We know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had divided the manuscript in two parts . " Here 's the beginning , Joe , " he said , " up to where Jim left off . I 'll give Jim the rest of it and you can ask him for it when you 're ready . " " All right , " said Joe , " let 's have it . " But Allen still held the manuscript , behaving just as he had when he had shown it to me before . " The first page is a little jerky , " he said . " I was trying to get the feel of the thing . Jim made the remark that some of the language was crude . " " Jim ought to know better , " Joe said . " You have to let yourself go , Allen . " " You really think so ? " Allen asked . " Well , I have let myself go. 152I 've tried to be absolutely myself . Here it is , Joe . Just remember the first page is rather rough . " By this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you sure you 're comfortable in that chair , Joe ? " Allen asked . " Is the light all right ? Are you comfortable , Jim ? I 've always liked that Windsor chair myself . " I wished for heaven 's sake he would shut up . The room was refreshingly quiet when we began to read , but Allen was still fidgeting about , first looking at us , then looking at his books . The sound of the motors on Memorial Drive came through the windows . Allen took down a large leather folio from the shelves and retired to his desk . As I sat there reading I was reminded of an examination room in the old days . Allen was behind the desk to see that Joe and I did not cheat . He pretended not to look at us , but I knew he was not reading . Once I stole a glance at Joe . He was going at his work deliberately , dropping each page abstractedly upon the floor when he had finished it . Joe was a fast and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd first known him , whether he was drunk or sober . At the end of fifteen minutes Allen spoke . " What do you think of it so far ? " he asked . Joe looked up as though his mind had been called back from a long distance . " It 's amazing , " he said . " Do n't interrupt me , Allen . " " How far have you read ? " Allen asked . " Where he gets back from watching the cows in the stable , " Joe said , " and finds her in the kitchen after everyone has gone to bed . " " You think that 's all right ? " Allen asked . " I was a little afraid about that part . " " You need n't be , " said Joe . " Now let me go ahead . " " And you 're really interested ? " said Allen . " It 's going fine so far , " said Joe . " Have you got any whisky , Allen ? " 153 " Oh , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes , of course . I 'll go and fetch some . " We sat listening to his footsteps as he crossed the hall and the dining room . The pantry door swung to behind him , and we heard him giving Sam directions . Then Joe got up , tiptoed toward me and held out his hand . " Boy , " Joe whispered , " it 's all right . You win . Everything 's all right . It 's just perfectly lousy and his publisher will have to print it . I 'm almost sorry for him now . " Joe and I did not make a pretty picture . I was almost ashamed of my relief and at my sense of vindication , but not wholly . " Get back there , " I whispered , " he 's coming with the whisky . " And then I raised my voice . " It 's very full-bodied , Joe . " " Yes , " said Joe , " full-bodied . " We could hear Allen Southby crossing the ( lining room on tiptoe . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had heard that it was full-bodied . There was a clink of ice and glasses . " Give me what you 've finished , Jim , " Joe said . " Pour me out a drink , Allen . It 's getting better all the time . " The part of Allen 's manuscript which I was reading was worse than the beginning , and each page which I finished confirmed a number of my opinions about practical writing . Considering the shelves of volumes in the stacks of libraries dealing with the art , it is amazing how little this great mass has ever contributed to any sensible discussion  --  probably because nearly all those books have been written by hangers-on at the edges of the trade . My mind strayed away from Allen Southby 's manuscript as I thought of this , for I had gone once , like so many others , to this very type of literature in search of expert guidance . And now no matter how I racked my brain I could scarcely recall a single serious book on the craftsmanship of fiction written by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could write had ever wanted to discuss it . No one could teach anyone else to write . You could be as industriousas you pleased ; you could steep yourself in the technique of all the Flauberts and Maupassants and Dickenses who had gone before , and out of it would come exactly nothing . That was the trouble with Allen Southby . There is something revealing about amateur fiction which is particularly ghastly , for in this type of effort you can see all the machinery behind the scene . I could tell exactly what Allen had been reading before he had set to work . He had made a study of Hardy  --  it must have been a dreary task  --  and then he had touched on Sherwood Anderson and Glenway Westcott and O'Neill . He had been reading a lot of those earth-earthy books , where the smell of dung and the scent of the virgin sod turned by the plow runs through long paragraphs of primitive though slightly perverted human passion ; but those others could write , and Allen Southby never would if he lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing stimulating again . I was thinking of ways in which I might have changed it . Allen was back at his desk , fiddling with his folio volume . He saw me right away when I paused and reached for the whisky glass . " There 's nothing the matter with it , is there , Jim ? " he asked . " No , " I said . " It 's very provocative , Allen . " " That 's wonderful , " said Allen . " Thank you , Jim , but we must n't disturb Joe . " The delicate feeling of liking that I was experiencing for him , born probably from a sense of remorse , vanished with this remark . He was an intellectual snob and an intellectual ' climber . He had intimated without much tact that any adulation of mine was inconsequential now that Joe was there . He would never know that my remark had been completely truthful . Southby155had been provocative because he was writing about something which I could understand far better than he could ever understand it . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrested my attention so much as his manner of writing . His pages resembledthe efforts of visiting writers , who had spent their summersin Maine and on Cape Cod , to depict the New England scene . The effect was the same as when some Northern writer attempted an epic of the South , and could see nothing but nigger mammies and old plantations and colonels drinking juleps . These others , when they faced New England , saw only white houses , church spires , lilacs and picket hedges , gingham hypocrisy and psychoses and intolerance . Not even Kipling , the keenest observerwho had touched our coast , could do it . There was something which they did not see , an inexorable sort of gentleness , a vanity of effort , a sadness of predestined failure . I handed the rest of the pages to Joe and poured myself another drink . There was no need for conversation since Allen Southby did not want Joe to be disturbed . It was a quarter after ten o'clock and it was not unpleasant sitting there , listening to the noise outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing , and then I began thinking about myself in the hazy disorganized way one thinks when there is nothing else to do . I believed that I was under no illusion about my literary skill . I was not fool enough to attempt such a thing as Southby was attempting . It was all well enough to think of it , but even as I thought I knew that I should never do it . I did not have the energy nor could I afford the gamble , and a serious novel is a very great gamble for one who must live by writing . A five hundred dollars ' cash advance might be all that I could get for a year 's work , because the thing would never serialize . I knew that I should never do it . Allen Southby 's writing was filling my mind with all sorts of noncommercial ideas . I would be in New York in the morning , and I would be having a talk with my literary agent , but I could not talk with him of those ideas. 156My mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restless , to scenes at Wickford Point . I was thinking of them all standing by the doorway when we drove away after lunch . I had seen more of New England in this one day than Allen Southby had ever seen . I remembered how Herman had smelled when he had been held up for me to kiss . I had been aware of strange jealousies and of odd habits and of undercurrents of inheritance which had nothing much to do with lilacs or picket fences . Then halfinstinctively , without really meaning to , I was thinking of situationand plot . There were so many engrossing details of which one might write which could not decently be set down on paper . There was Wickford Point , for instance , and Joe and Bella Brill , and all the times we had had together , all those strange unprintable scenes which were really worth preserving . Some of them were bizarre , some of them were ugly , and some of them were beautiful . " Well , " Allen Southby was saying , " so you 've finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the manuscript , straightened the pages expertly , and handed them back to Allen , and Allen waited almost diffidentlyfor him to speak . " We all understand writing , " Joe said , " so we do n't need to talk much , do we , Allen ? " " No , " said Allen Southby , " no , of course not , Joe . I just want a reaction , but of course I am open to suggestions . I can stand criticism as well as the next man , as long as it 's intelligent criticism . " Joe nodded very gravely . Without saying anything he gave the impression of being deeply moved . I had seen him do the same thing before , and I nearly believed that he was in earnest . " Now , Allen , " Joe said , " I 'm not going to say anything , althoughmy inclination is to talk to you all night . I have n't been so excited for a long while . " " Were you really excited ? " Allen Southby asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't sleep all night . There are1571certain paragraphs and passages that keep running through my mind  --  that scene in the hayfield where she comes to help him find his shirt , and that part about the old lady hiding her money under the loose brick of the hearth . I wo n't forget those for a long while , Allen , but I 'm not going to speak of them . It would be too dangerous . " " How do you mean , too dangerous ? " Allen Southby asked . Joe picked up his glass , looked at it critically and drank its contents before he answered . " You have it going now , " Joe said , " at such a pace that I would n't have the rudeness to interrupt you , Allen . I might say something inadvertent which would break the flow of everything . That 's why I 'm not going to say a word , and Jim is n't going to say a word either . We 're standing on the threshold of something which we must not destroy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Allen said . " Do you think I 'd talk this way if I did n't like it ? " Joe Stowe asked . " But do n't you think you could just give me some idea , " Allen suggested , " of the way you feel ? " Joe shook his head firmly . " No , " he said , " it would be too dangerous . It would be an insolence , Allen . That 's the way I feel . You must n't talk about it to anyone , not even to Martha until you 've finished it . You 're just at the point where a word might spoil everything . " " You really think it 's as good as all that ? " Allen asked . " I certainly do , " said Joe . It was not right for anyone to look as happy as Allen Southby did . That luminous glow in his eyes was almost too good to be true . " Joe , " he said , " I ca n't thank you enough , really I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it 's finished ? " " I certainly will , " said Joe . " Would it be asking too much  --  " Allen asked  --  " I do n't wantto be too presuming , Joe  --  but would you consider writing a line or two to be put on the jacket ? " " I certainly will , " said Joe , " if my agent will let me . " I thought that Allen was going to ignore me altogether , but he did not . " Jim , " he said , " I 'm ever so glad you liked it . Your interest has meant a tremendous lot . I should n't have dared to show this to Joe if it had n't been for your encouragement . " " That 's all right , Allen , " I said . He looked at me with his most beguiling smile . " And  --  oh yes , " he said . " When can I come down to Wickford ? It would mean a tremendous lot to have a glimpse of things down there right when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to New York , " I said . " Do you have to go to New York ? " Allen asked . " When will you be back ? " " This week end perhaps , " I said . " Then let 's make it this week end , " said Allen Southby . " It 's awfully good of you , Jim . " Joe buttoned up his coat . " Thank you for everything , Allen , " he said . " We 'll have to be going now . " We did not speak until we reached the car , and I was the one who spoke first . " God damn him , " I said . " I did n't ask him . " " Well , " said Joe , " he 's going . " Then Joe began to laugh and put his hand on my shoulder before I could answer . " Let 's forget it , Jim , " he said . " Was n't that stuff terrible ? " The trouble was that I could not forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for being mad , " Joe said . " He 's a caponized professor . Forget about it , Jim . " " All right , " I said , " but I ca n't forget about it . I keep thinking about how I 'd write that thing myself . " " You do ? " said Joe , and his voice was louder . " Well , I 've been thinking about how I 'd write it too . " " Oh , " I said , " you have , have you ? " " But I would n't steal one of your ideas , " said Joe . " They 're not worth stealing , " I said . Joe put his hand on my shoulder . " You 're sorry for yourself tonight , are n't you ? " he inquired . " What 's the matter ? Has Southby got you down ? " " No , " I said , " I 'm just thinking , Joe . " I was wondering how it ever happened that Joe and I had been thrown so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was an ominous sort of destiny in friendship , about which one could do nothing . " Listen , " Joe said , " do you really have to go to New York ? " I could tell that he had observed the bland way in which I had been ignored and I had a momentary suspicion that he was feeling sorry for me , and nothing from my point of view could have been worse . Such an attitude on his part would inevitably mean that I would end by being jealous of him also and I was doing my best not to be jealous of Joe Stowe . I had been telling myself16ofor a long while that I was glad of everything that had happened to him , that I took a personal sort of pride in his career . " There are some things I 've got to do about a serial story , " I said , " and besides I want to get away from Wickford Point . " " That 's funny , is n't it ? " said Joe . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Point , " Joe said . " You all go down there and say how lovely it is , and then none of you can stand it . Everyone starts fighting and then everyone goes to Europe . " " You used to like it once , " I said . The cars which passed us from the opposite direction made dashes of light against the windshield , like uneven splashes of phosphorescent water . Joe 's voice was grim when he answered . " Yes , " he agreed , " I loved it . It 's all right when you 're not mixed up in it . If you 're going to New York , what are you going to do with your car ? " " Leave it in a garage , " I said . " Sid always monkeys with it if I leave it at Wickford Point . " " Oh , my God , " said Joe . " Sid 's there , is he ? Is Harry there ? Has he got some new ideas ? " I told him that Harry was coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that same muddy smell from the river , " said Joe . " And the trees will be greener than anywhere else , and the hummingbirds will keep buzzing in the trumpet vines , and the plumbing will get out of order . And the tortoise-shell cat will have kittens and everybody will be unhappy in the parlor , and Sid will have indigestion and nobody will be able to stand it any longer . " There was no use answering . Joe remembered everything . " There will still be some delphiniums in the little garden , " he said . " I do n't suppose anyone 's ever got around to weeding it . I do n't suppose anyone 's cleared out the path to the point . " He paused and I did not answer . We were almost back in town before he spoke again. 161 " Jim , " he said , " let 's get out of this . It is n't good for you to hang around that place . Maybe we could do some work if we went away . I 'm sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to go ? " I asked . " You do n't want to be quiet . You like to be bothered . " Joe moved uneasily . " Well , I need a change , " he said . " I can fix it so we go out to China . What do you say , Jim ? Or if you do n't like China , there 's Spain . How about going to Barcelona ? Or if you do n't like that , there 's  --  " " There 's what ? " I asked . " Oh , hell , " said Joe , " there 's anywhere . " I knew exactly what he meant . He was thinking about Wick- ford Point ; he was still trying to put it behind him . " I 'll think about it , Joe , " I said , but I was reasonably sure that he would forget it all by morning . We were stopping by the brightly lighted door of his hotel by then , and you could see the shadows of the elm trees on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had once caused so much civic disturbance . " That 's fine , " Joe said . " I 'll get hold of you as soon as I finish this lecture business . I mean it , Jim . Did n't we have a hell of an evening ? " " Yes , " I said , " terrible . So long , Joe . " " So long , " he said , and we shook hands . Ile was just turning away when I called him back . " Joe , " I said , " there 's just one thing . You keep away from Bella , do you understand ? It wo n't do any good . " The lights above the door were full on his face when he turned back to me , and I remembered again what Cousin Clothilde had said  --  that it was an undistinguished face . You could see all the freckles and the oversized mouth and the deep-set yellowish green eyes . I had not been sure until that last moment that he was hav- 162 ing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were plenty of other women in the world , and I happened to know he knew it ,  --  offhand I could name three of them in New York ,  --  but he was still not having a happy time . Divorce is like a major operation . You think you are all right and then you have a sinkingspell . He was standing there under the lights , and there was nothing much that anyone could do about it . It was like the ending of a story which no editor would want to buy . A while ago he had nearly been sorry for me , and now I was sorry for him , and I was the one who had started it . I was the one who had first taken him to Wickford Point ... . " ... She ought to meet some older men , " Cousin Clothilde had said . " I mean some interesting men . What ever happened to that nice friend of yours , Mr. Lowe ? The one you brought to Wickford Point ? He 's just the sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Avery Gifford . I do n't see what she sees in Avery . Ca n't you call up Mr. Stowe and ask him to dinner ? . . . " Joe Stowe put his foot on the running-hoard for a moment . " You damned fool , " he said , " I want to keep away from Bella . That 's why I 'm going somewhere . " " What about Elsie Cash ? " I asked . It was hardly the time or the place to bring that matter up . Joe held out his hand again . " Oh , " he said , " oh , that . . . Well , so long , Jim . " The South Station had changed . It was as new and shiny and as streamlined as modern diplomacy . It made you think of fivepointprograms , of candid cameras , of leftists and rightists and of the People 's Front ; in fact , of all those elements that had cropped up to change the life one used to know . Down the center of the station were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw Joe Stowe 's last book out in front  --  and toys for the kiddies , which could be purchased by a conscience-163stricken parent before it was too late , and giant orange drinks and liquor and flowers and nationally advertised confectionery . Yes , the station was changed , but it had the old allure . There were the same porters and the same whiffs of smoke bringing the same electrifying message . The message was that you were getting away from it and going to New York , and after that you might go anywhere . You were getting away from what was static ; you were off to have a good time beyond correction and reproof . All the other times when I had left from that stationreturned to me , and the memories of nearly all of them were merry . There was the time when Cousin Sue had given the porter a dollar to see that I got back safely to my parents , and when we were driven across the city in a four-wheel cab . Then there were the times when Harry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . Cousin Clothilde always put me up in those days , in one of the brownstone houses which she and Archie Wright had rented . You could never tell from year to year just where their house would be . Some years it was in the East Seventies , and once in the Murray Ilill district ,  --  one of their nicest houses was turned into a speakeasy later on ,  --  or again it might be down in Washington Square . And once I remember that the whole front of the house they had rented was being torn off and everybody lived in back , and you got mixed up with carpenters and contractors on your way to breakfast . It made no difference though ; it was always a lot of fun wherever Cousin Clothilde and Archie Wright were living . Harry and I used to come down together , always in upper berths , and when we arrived in the morning Cousin Clothilde was always up and glad to see us , and usually Archie Wright came down in his pajamas . As one looks back on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard on him , being married to a whole houseful of Brills , with me frequently thrown in . We were always getting into his bureau drawers to borrow his shirts and neckties . Occasionally around dinnertime he would be de-164pressed , and once he said he did not know that he had married an orphan asylum , but generally he was affable , and he made Harry and me feel that we were his contemporaries . No matter where they were living the house always had a certain style , and there was always something funny happening . Once in the old days , when there was more money , they had a French manservant who used to hoist himself up from the kitchen in the dumbwaiter , and who ended at last by coming into the dining room brandishing a carving knife . There were usually some interesting people around , artistic contemporaries , or else callers who might conceivably buy murals . One man who used to come there was named Algernon Weir , and he always would hold his left arm in front of him and pretend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes it made Cousin Clothilde nervous when he caressed the imaginary bird , but finally he went away somewhere . Lots of the people who came there one season would vanish , but in their places were always new and fascinating faces . There was another man , named Theodore Rudy , who took a great liking to me and sent me a bunch of roses . One winter there was a faith healer and the next there was a theosophist and the next there was a Turk . As I have said , there was always something funny happening , and it was refreshingly different from Harvard . Back in those days Archie Wright had met a man at Jack 's , who had commissioned him to do a mural for a municipal court building in Iowa , and it really seemed as though Archie might finally get started . All this was before he became interested in capital and labor and allowed ideology to interfere with work . There was a good deal of distinction about Archie 's and Cousin Clothilde 's lives then , because they knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave them a peculiar cachet in New York . All the schools were anxious to have the little girls go to them , because they were Brills . Sidney was away at St. Swithin 's , and Mary and Bella went to Miss Lacey's. 165They had a French governess too , and every afternoon they were put into white starched dresses and allowed to come down to tea . That was almost the only time Harry and I would see them . Of course everything was different at Wickford Point . Archie Wright only went there twice in his life . He said he could n't stand it . A porter carried my bag and we walked over to Track Fifteen , where the tickets were examined by the conductor behind the desk . " Lower nine , " the man said . " Car one seven eight . You would n't care to change it to a section , would you ? " " No , thanks , " I said , and he gave me hack the stub of my ticket . " Lower nine , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And we walked into the cool smoky dark of the train shed . I had that old happy feeling of going somewhere , and at the same time I was living over a good deal of my life in that strange mannerwhich occurs now and then when one is performing the conventional acts of the present . " Car one seven eight , " the porter said . It was all very much as it had always been , the same hushed narrow aisle of green curtains , the Negro in his white coat asking in a whisper when I wished to be awakened . It was like some scene in the play called " Outward Bound . " No one ever knew who lay behind those curtains and no one ever cared . The dimly lighted aisle was a timeless place , so that the thing that happened next was not surprising . I heard a voice behind me , a careful voice which was rather flat . A youngish man was speaking to me and I did not know him from Adam . " Hello , Jim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Why , hello , " I said , but I did n't recognize him and he saw that I did n't . " I 'm Avery Gifford , " he said. 166 " Of course , " I said . " Hello , Avery . " And after that there did not seem to be much to say . " Are you going to New York ? " he asked . " Yes , " I said . " I suppose you 're going to New York too . Let 's go into the washroom and smoke a cigarette . " " I do n't mind watching you , " said Avery , " but I 've given up cigarettes . " " Have you ? Why ? " I asked . " It 's bad for my wind , " he said , " and maybe you 've read the statistics . Heavy smokers die sooner . " " And you want to live ? " I said . He looked a little puzzled , but I had remembered everything about Avery Gifford by this time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to live . " " That 's fine , " I said . " You did n't the . last time I saw you . " " Oh , " he said , and his tanned face grew redder . " Oh yes , that . " We sat together on the long seat in the washroom . A heavy man in his undershirt and trousers was brushing his teeth . We watched him without speaking until he finished . While we sat there silently Avery Gifford looked as though he distrusted the impulse which had made him speak to me , and that last remark of mine must have told him that I remembered a great many things which he would not care to discuss . We sat there mutely examining the metal wash-basins and the cuspidors . " Well , " I said , " how have you been ? " " Very well , thank you , " said Avery . " How have you been ? " " About the same as you , " I said . " Where are you this summer ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avery , " at Nahant . " " Still at Nahant ? " I asked . " Yes , " Avery answered . " We always spend the summers there . " He shuffled his feet uneasily on the linoleum . " I 'm marriedyou know , " he added . " Yes , " I said , " I know . You married one of the Bosworth girls , Betty Bosworth , did n't you ? You sent me an announcement . " 167 " Oh yes , " said Avery . " We have three children now , a boy and two girls . I wish you 'd stop in to see us sometime . I 'd like you to meet Betty . " " Thanks , " I said , " I 'd like to , Avery . " We both must have known that I would not stop in , and I also knew that he did not really wish I would , but it was nice of him just the same . He sat with his forearms resting on his knees , clasping his hands together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were a good deal the worse for wear ; there was nothing in his appearance to show that he had inherited ten million dollars , and I rather liked him for it . While he sat there , thinking of something else to say , not wishing to speak of what was on his mind , the thought came back to me again that love as viewed objectively is nothing but a disease and that Avery , when he fell in love with Bella Brill , had contractedthat disease just as inadvertently as one contracts a head cold from riding in the subway . Or had it been like that ? It was possible that there might have been some wild and unfulfilled streak in Avery 's nature and some latent revolt against the environmentwhich now held him . If so , he had lived it down . Yet even now he wanted to speak of Bella . " I read some of the things you write sometimes , " Avery said . " I have half an hour to kill every evening on the train . Have you been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " Have you ? " " Yes , " Avery answered . " The tennis was very good this year . " I could not help but wonder about him and about his life . That life of Avery Gifford 's was so far apart from anything I knew , so completely ordered in its security , so undeviating and so admirable ; nor was it entirely sterile if he had produced three children . " Why are you going to New York , Avery ? " I asked . " Well , " he said , " someone had to go . It 's about the income tax . I always try to keep away from New York as much as possible , 168but someone in the family had to go . " He clasped his hands togetherand unclasped them again , observing his fingers intently , and then he cleared his throat . " I was sorry to hear about Bella , " he added . He had come to it at last , and no doubt he felt better now that it was over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avery lowered his voice and still looked at his hands . " The divorce , " he said . " Perhaps I should n't have spoken of it . " " There 's no reason why you should n't , " I replied . " A lot of people have . " " I do n't like gossip , " Avery said . " It must have been hard on Bella . She 's so highly strung , so delicate . " " It 's just as well it 's over with , " I said . It was the best reply to make , but his remark about her being delicate surprised me . It meant that he had never known what Bella was at all . He was one of those pedestal-putters , like many of the rest of us . So there was Bella enshrined still in the mind of Avery Gifford , forever beyond him , forever virginal and pure . It was better to leave it just that way . " How is Bella ? " he asked . " She 's pretty well , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all , " Avery said . " I kept wishing there was something I could do about it . " " There was nothing you could do , Avery . " " I do n't suppose there was , " said Avery . " That 's what Betty said , but I wish there had been . When you sec Bella will you give her my  --  " He paused as if he had checked himself . "  --  my kindest regards ? " " Of course I will , " I told him ; " but Betty is absolutely right . " Avery got up and very nearly stumbled on a cuspidor . " Yes , " he said , " of course she is . Betty 's wonderful . " He seemedto have forgotten that I had never met Betty . " Betty always has169Ijust the right reaction . She 's the one who made me go down to New York on this thing . Well , I suppose I 'd better go to bed . I do n't suppose we 'll meet in the morning . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be busy all the time . It 's nice to have seen you again . Be sure to give Bella my regards . " " Good night , Avery , " I said . The green curtain closed behind him and I was left alone . It was an odd coincidence to have seen him there that night , for he fitted in with all my other thoughts and took his place among the imponderables . Suppose she had married Avery Gifford , she could not have stood it for more than a year or two . Once she had told me that herself , but even so she might have marriedhim . There would never be another chance like that for Bella Brill , and I was the one who had spoiled it . Bella and even Cousin Clothilde had been careful to remind me that Joe Stowe was my friend . " Aboard , " someone was calling , " all aboard . " She would have met Joe in any case , but I was the one who had brought him to Wickford Point. 170XVIYou Dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avery Gifford . Aside from love , if love had ever bothered her , it must have been a struggle for Bella to turn him down ; for Bella always had her wits about her , even when she did not use them . She must have seen security staring her in the face , generous and unbounded , hers forever . And Avery Gifford had been a nice boy too . The Brills , who always studied social desirability , had conceded that the Gifford family connection had been quite as good as theirs , except that the Giffords might have too much money . It might have been a very brilliant match , though I happened to know that old Colebrook Gifford had been harassed by the prospect and that Mrs. Gifford  --  the one who had sent a young man from her house because she had seen him sweeten his ginger ale from a pocket flask  --  had been obliged to consult a psychiatrist . As I sat solitary in the train , I suddenly knew exactly why Bella had not gone through with it . The unexpected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen him as Bella must have seen him long ago . He had not represented security ; instead he had represented the unknown . He had signified continuity , and Bella had been afraid . He would have taken her away from Wickford Point and Bella had been afraid . There was no security at Wickford Point , but there was something else  --  the ghost of a vanished security , which had developed into something necessary  --  and all of Bella 's seeming boldness must have been make-believe . It is difficult to realize that all sorts of irrational , 171indefinable fears are deep inside of all of us ready to spring up when we least expect them , and the worst of it is we do not know of what we are afraid . I could remember when there had been security at Wickford Point , when the house had a clean , soapy smell , when there were plenty of people in the kitchen to do the work , and two outside men to tend the garden and the grounds . That was when my grandfather was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The subsequent change was gradual , like the decline of the Roman Empire , and children do not often notice such essentials , although they observe most of the things that grown-ups forget or take for granted . When I came to live at Wickford Point Aunt Sarah had already grown very forgetful . She had given up fine embroidery and her work on hooked rugs was somewhat ragged . When she read aloud she would sometimes repeat a page because she forgot to turn it . There were no longer any pilot biscuits in the cracker jar in the closet off the dining room , and there was only one woman in the kitchen . There was also a succession of housekeepercompanions who helped out with the work and with Aunt Sarah and who sat with us at table . I never minded any of this , because I was allowed to wear old clothes and to walk into the house with rubber boots if I had been shooting ducks or rails down the river . Aunt Sarah often used to think that I was my father or someoneelse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for she always said that it was nice to have the boys around . She was not as kind to Cousin Sue . Sometimes at supper , which usually consisted of pale scrambled eggs and toast and cracked cocoa , Cousin Sue would be taken with a violent fit of sneezing . This always exasperated Aunt Sarah . After Cousin Sue had sneezed twice , Aunt Sarah would hit the table with the handle of her knife . " Leave the room , Sue , " she would say , " until you have stopped sneezing. " 172Both Aunt Sarah and Cousin Sue were interested in Unitarianismand homeopathic medicine , but their absorption in the Brills transcended these . Cousin Sue was enormously proud that the family was connected with the Brills . She was always looking for signs of genius in the Brill children , although she never deposited money for them in the savings bank until they were two years old , so that she could be sure they were not idiots . She got this from Aunt Sarah , who was always afraid that there might be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed , Cousin Sue was sure they were geniuses . Cousin Sue was always wishing that they could be with us more frequently . Harry was my contemporary , and Cousin Sue was particularly interested in him . " If Harry were only here now , " she would say , " he would so appreciate the beauty of it all . " From my acquaintance with Harry I did not think he had much eye for beauty . He was much more interested in electricity and in jigsaw puzzles . However , I agreed with Cousin Sue in that I always wished the Brills were there . Cousin Clothilde used to bring the children up every summer quite early , and then a little later generally go abroad with Archie Wright . Cousin Sue was delighted about Archie Wright . It was so nice , she said , for Clothilde to marry again , and natural that she should marry such a brilliant person . Cousin Sue was always anxious to see him and always hoped that he might come up to Wickford Point . She never could understand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that he had hidden in the pantry once when she came to New York , and then escaped through the back door and stayed at the club until Cousin Sue had returned to Wickford Point . She always wanted until the last clay of her life to have a good long talk with Archie Wright . When the Brills came down to Wickford Point the whole place changed . There would be Harry and Sid and the two girls and quite often two maids to look after them . These maids usually173gave notice at the end of two weeks , but afterwards we always got along . Of course Bella was very young at that time , and Mary was not much older ; nevertheless Cousin Sue could see what Bella would become eventually . " Bella is turning into a very beautiful young woman , " she used to say . " She is going to be just like her mother . I do wish the children would n't make such a noise . I can not hear myself think . " I could understand what Cousin Sue meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I was secretly in love with Mr. Jeffries ' daughter up the road , but when I could remove my mind from this amatory problem , I used to think that I was Henry Esmond and that Bella was Beatrix Castlewood . Bella was usually a little cold to me at first because she had been to Miss Lacey 's School and she did not know exactly where I belonged , but she always got over it in a day or two . She was the one who always wanted to be doing things . Mary was like Sid and preferred to sit in the house . Bella used to wander around the place , and after a while her dresses would get so dirty that no one could do anything with them . She would keep teasing me to take her for walks or downriverin the canoe where we could go fishing off the jetty . If it was n't that , she wanted me to read poetry to her . She had an astonishinglygood memory for poetry . " She is certainly going to be a poet like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed with Cousin Sue , that Bella was as pretty as her mother . In fact Cousin Clothilde seemed so beautiful that I was almost afraid of her . She used to stay in bed smoking cigarettes until just before luncheon , and as she smoked I knew it could not be immoral . She would send for various members of the family to come to see her while she lay there . " You 'll have to entertain me , Jim , " she said . " I ca n't be expected to stay by myself all morning . " It never occurred to me to wonder why she did not get up like the rest of us . " Tell me what they are doing downstairs , " Cousin Clothildewould say . " What 's Aunt Sarah doing ? She 's vaguer this year than she 's ever been before . I never did like Aunt Sarah . She is really a disagreeable old woman , and if Sue wants to see me , will you tell her I have a bad headache , please ? She keeps talking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how you stand it , Jim dear . I 've always said you should n't be left down here . I hope Bella is n't in the cow barn again . When you go down I want you to get Mary to sort out the stockings in the upper bureau drawer for me , and I wish you could get Sid to go for a walk with you and Bella . You 're such a comfort , darling . I wish you 'd tell me about Mr. Morrissey . I know he drinks and I do hope he is n't getting into trouble with any of the maids . You do n't think he will , do you ? " " Who ? Mr. Morrissey ? " I said . " He 's married and has two children . " " Darling , " said Cousin Clothilde , " that does n't make a bit of difference . I wish you could ask them to get me some safety matches and not these matches that scratch on anything . I really do n't see how you stand it , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's all very well to like it , " Cousin Clothilde said , " but that 's different from living here all the time . It will be better when you get to college . " " I suppose so , but I do n't mind it here , " I said . " But you must n't get to like it too much , Jim clear , " said Cousin Clothilde . " I like it too much myself , and it is n't good for any-body . " She treated me exactly as she might have treated someone who was her own age  --  which is a very difficult feat for an adult to achieve , for it has to be spontaneous . Everyone , with the possible exception of my great-aunt Sarah , took it for granted that Cousin Clothilde needed a great deal of rest and personal attention . Consequently Cousin Clothilde arrangedthings with no effort on her part so that all the life of174 175Wickford Point revolved around her whenever she was there . Whether she was in bed or sitting beneath the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it if anyone else was busy ; yet Cousin Clothilde was not tyrannical like other women I have known who have dominated their environment . We were never afraid that she might fly into a temper or that her feelings might be hurt . She never stooped to any such wiles either consciously or unconsciously . We all waited upon Cousin Clothilde , and we all came when she called us because we liked to do so . She had that useful power of making everyone pleased and anxious to do things for her . Indeed the only person at Wickford Point who avoided her was my great-aunt Sarah . Aunt Sarah was too old to say much , and moreover she always seemed to be busy . She kept working in her garden or walking to the point with her basket for chips , or up the hill to the pigsty to feed the pigs , moving through a world in which she could perceive only dimly the shapes of Cousin Clothilde and the little Brills . Her mind was . occupied with vanished personalities , and ghosts were always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she sat and talked with Cousin Clothilde as the rest of us ( lid , and that occasion was rather unsettling . I think she usually looked upon Cousin Clothilde with disapproval , because she never had liked people who were not industrious . One afternoon , however , she came upon Cousin Clothilde sitting on the lawn under the big oak tree , looking at the river . Cousin Clothilde was in a light lavender dress and she was looking very pretty , and Aunt Sarah sat down on the bench beside her . " Clethra , " she said to Cousin Clothilde , " have you finished already with the washing ? " Cousin Clothilde must have been startled , and not without justice , for Aunt Sarah had mistaken her for my grandmother . " I am not Aunt Clethra , Aunt Sarah , " she said . " Well , well , " said Aunt Sarah , " if you 're not Clethra , I 'm sure I do n't know who you are . If you want to play a guessing game , I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , Clethra , but it would be nice to know if you 've done the washing first . Georgianna is getting back this afternoon . " " But I 'm not Aunt Clethra , Aunt Sarah , " Cousin Clothilde said . " I 'm Clothilde , Aunt Sarah dear , Georgianna 's daughter . " " Well , well , " said Aunt Sarah , " it does n't really signify . Georgiannais coming back from that farm this evening and it may be that Mr. Hawthorne is coming too . I should admire it if you put the spare-room bed in order . " " But my own children are sleeping in the spare room , Aunt Sarah dear , " Aunt Clothilde said . " Well , " said Aunt Sarah , " I do n't see how that signifies , Clethra , if Mr. Hawthorne is coming . I 've watched you this afternoon . You 're forever sitting still and letting me do all the work , and I will not have it . Do you hear , Clethra ? Mr. Brill is rowing across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here myself . " " Oh , " said Cousin Clothilde , " my God ! Sue ! Where are you , Sue ? " Cousin Sue hurried as fast as she could across the lawn , stumbling occasionally because she had mislaid her spectacles . " What is it , Clothilde ? " Cousin Sue asked . " Oh goodness gracious , what is it ? " There were a good many things which Cousin Clothilde did not like , but there were not many of which she was afraid . In this instance she was probably more puzzled and exasperated than afraid . It could not have been mentally comfortable to have been wandering with Aunt Sarah in the land of shadows . " She insists that I 'm Aunt Clethra , " Cousin Clothilde said . " Oh good gracious , " said Cousin Sue . " She is n't Clethra , Aunt Sarah . She 's Clothilde . You remember Clothilde . " " Clothilde is n't grown-up , " Aunt Sarah said . " I saw her in the garden only a few minutes ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if she were about to cry ,  --  " Clothilde 's grown-up . She married Hugh Brill , do n't you1 176 77remember ? You must have seen one of her children in the garden . It 's time to come into the house now to get your medicine , Aunt Sarah . " " Well , " said Aunt Sarah , " it does n't signify if I get confused sometimes , does it ? If you get to be my age , Sue , as I hope very much you wo n't , for your sake , you may grow somewhat confused yourself . Well , well , I 'm sure there 's no use upsetting yourself either . It really does not signify at all , for everything that I have said remains absolutely true . " She may have been very nearly right that it did not signify at all , for there had been so many people at Wickford Point that their personalities did become entangled . Cousin Sue was certainly growing more and more confused herself . She was having a very difficult time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could never be bothered with them . The children were always running through the house and Mary was generally having a crying spell just when it came time to pay the bills ; and then Cousin Sue would keep spilling ink on her checkbookand the balance was never correct ; and besides , the bills were always getting into the wrong cubbyhole in the block-front desk . Also , more than once Aunt Sarah burned them all up because she thought that they were some of her old love letters . Everything else was always being mixed up in Cousin Sue 's desk too , because Bella kept getting into it and fingering all its appurtenancessuch as the petrified shark 's tooth which our greatgrandfatherhad brought back from the Galapagos Islands , and the delicate little balance for weighing letters , and Bella spoiled all the pens because she was busy writing a story about a girl who lived with a gnome in a castle . Everything possible was done , of course , to allow Bella to write it , since she was showing the literary instincts of the Brills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is n't anyone to look after anything , " Cousin Clothilde said to me once . " There ought to be a man to take care of things . Your cousin Hugh was never interested and Archie has so much178else on his mind , and besides Archie does n't like it here . There should be some man to do the bills . I wish that one of the family 's old friends would adopt me . It would be such a beautiful thing to do , and so many of them have so much money . I 'm tired of doing everything for everybody . It 's high time that someone else did . " This idea of adoption was something which Cousin Clothilde brought up very often , and certainly it might have solved a great many problems . Her ideas were often logical  --  but though she wanted things done she did not want to see anyone do them . I have a different impression of Wickford Point today from any I had then . Just now , I can see that Wickford Point was like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainland . I can see it being severed from realities when I was still very young , and drifting off , a self-contained entity , into a misty sea . It was a land almost entirely sufficient unto itself , and governed by the untutored thoughts of women  --  although this does not mean that others did not assert themselves . The right of self-determination was not even confined to human beings . When Aphrodite , the tortoise-shell cat , wanted to have her kittens in the lower bureau drawer in the bedroom above the back parlor , it was necessary to move a good many things , and as the time for the accouchement approached , chairs were placed in the upper hall in a sort of barricade so that Aphroditewould not be disturbed : When Clara , the old setter bitch given to Cousin Sue by a man whom she had met fishing for pickerel through the ice in the north pond  --  when Clara began to get ugly in about her twelfth year , she would take up a position on the landing of the front stairs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So we all had to use the back stairs until Clara finally died . Then there was the trouble with the two cows that were still kept at Wickford Point . They only gave enough milk to feed Aunt Sarah 's two pigs , so they were not much use to us , and their main desire was to eat the white phlox in
