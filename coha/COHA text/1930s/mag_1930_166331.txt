China has no constitution in the accepted meaning of the word , no bill of rights , and her greatest living sage Dr. Hu Shih ( TIME , Sept. 9 ) has recently said : There has never been any attempt to define by law the limits of government action in China , nor has there been any constitutional provision for the protection of the rights and liberties of the people . " Therefore the great powers were closely attentive , fortnight ago , when Foreign Minister Cheng-Ting ( " C. T. " ) Wang cockily announced that his government had abolished the right ( " extraterritoriality " ) of foreigners in China to be tried in their own consular courts ( TIME , Jan. 6 ) . For 48 hours it seemed as though foreigners were going to be subjected along with Chinese to the gross and notorious malfeasance of Chinese courts where bribery is rampant , trial by jury unknown , and the local military commander often dictates the decision of the judge . <P> As the hours passed , London , Washington and Tokyo put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retracted . He blandly announced himself in complete accord with the following trick statement , masterfully drafted by the British Foreign Office : " His Majesty 's government are willing to agree that Jan. 1 , 1930 , should be treated as the date from which the process of the gradual abolition of extraterritoriality should be regarded as having commenced in principle . " <P> London 's suave lead was followed by Tokyo and Washington , where Secretary of State Henry Lewis Stimson announced that " in the matter of extraterritoriality the American and Chinese governments are now in complete accord . " Thus the British masterminds which coined such weasel terms as " The Irish Free State " ( see p. 27 ) appeared again triumphant . Abolition of extraterritoriality will be delayed for years , but China 's face has been saved .
