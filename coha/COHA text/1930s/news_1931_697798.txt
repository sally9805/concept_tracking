txt They Have Seen Cows . To the Editor of The New York Times : A reprint from TFIE Tags has just reached us from Santa Fe , N. M. The editorial which they reprint concerns a motor truck with two cows and two calves which has been circulating among the Los Angeles elementary schools . We note with some amusement that the editorial writer deplored the fact that Los Angeles should have " developed a tenement population so large as would be indicated by the fact that one child in every four has never been out in the open country long enough to have seen a cow . " With perfectly good old fllvvers that can be bought for from $10 up , such tenement population as we have man- , ages to circulate quite a bit . but California has so many splendid roads that open country along these highways is almost a thing of the past . What with hot-dog stands and highway stands selling citrus fruits , orange groves and shining residences , poor old bossy has had to take to the back country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " In New York City there must be scores of thousands of children who have stood face to face with tigers and boa-constrictors and armadillos in the Central Park Zoo , I but have never seen a cow . " It just so happens that this cow story , together with pictures , which has been circulated in foreign lands as well as locally , was under discussion today . An educator said : " New York City maintains a number of barnyard fowls and animals especially for the benefit of its school children . Classes are taken to Central Park from time to time to become personally acquainted with the geese and ducks , pigs and chickens , turkey gobblers and cows , and their varied offspring . " I might add that the calves and the cows that have been trundled around the Los Angeles schools have gotten so that they " moo " with delight when a class pours out into the school yard . That means that their noses will be patted and their ears rubbed , and they seem to show more pleasure than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , April 27 , 1931 . A Heroic Bus Driver . To the Editor of The New York Times : Surely all of us are pleased and thrilled to see how graciously our President is showing his appreciation of the heroism of young Bryan Untiedt , of which too much can not be said . But in our admiration for this fine young hero , let us not forget the brave , unselfish effort of the dead hero , Mr. Miller , the bus driver . In that sad tragedy five little school children were frozen to death , the driver 's little girl among them . Had the driver wrapped his warm coat about his own child and remained with her , he might have saved her life and his own . But evidently in his heart was firmly planted the knowledge that right is an eternal , immutable thing , which must be adhered to at whatsoever sacrifice , just because it is right , and he went out into the death-dealing blizzard to seek help in an endeavor to save all the children entrusted to his care . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman was sorry enough for the fate of this man whose breadwinning hands had been stilled in death , to send $100 to the needy widow . An employer of many men once said : " I always like to promote a man who has made any sacrifice to save others . " Perhaps , fortunately , One has not left the bus driver 's promotion to us mere humans , and we trust he has gone to an excellent reward . A. W. M. New York . April 30 , 1931.
