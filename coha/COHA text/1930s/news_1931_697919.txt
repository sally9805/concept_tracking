txt Present price of copper of Si . cents a pound delivered makes it impossible for practically all companies to break even with depreciation and all other proper charges included . Even with only operating costs included . which are before depreciation , producers of over half of the world 's present output of roughly 250.000. - 000 pounds a month probably are not able to break even with copper under 802 cents deliv-ered This is why same of the copper mines are beginning to curtail further and even to shut down completely for the summer . Some of the mines that have closed can produce copper fairly cheaply , but the managements do not believe it wise , and to the best interests of their stockholders , to continue to sell copper at present prices . Already United Verde with an output of about 8,000.000 pounds a month has shut down . Magma with an output of 2,400,000 pounds a month is down ( United Verde indefinitely and Magma for six weeks ) , while United Verde Extension with a capacity of roughly 3.000.000 pounds a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from July 1 . Further Shutdowns-Likely Soon It is probable that other mines will soon begin to shut down for one reason or another . Some feel that the copper situation will be brought into more stable equilibrium through voluntary curtailment of output during the next two months , and that there swill not be a general shutdown In their opinion it will not be necessary for price of copper to go below S cents delivered to bring about such curtailment . Others take the view that a decline in price below S cents may be necessary to bring the curtailment in time to avoid a further large increase in copper stocks . Now approximately 1.200.000.000 pounds of refined copper are above ground . including copper paid for and held by producers for consumers . Considering the rapid decline in both foreign and domestic shipments in April and May , and that the outlook is for total shipments in June , and probably also in July , to be below average . of-93,214 tons for the first five months this year . reduction in mine output may be faster than seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the low shipments which totaled only 71.949 tons and were smallest in many years . being even lower than those of 79,213 tons in April , 1930. refined stocks in No , th and South America increased over 61,000,000 pounds , while foreign storks of all kinds in Europe increased over 9,000,000 pounds . Production Conti , Loser The situation is dependent somewhat upon the condition of the treasuries of the various companies and the cost of making copper . These costs are off materially from what they were a year or so ago , owing to the greater efficiency with which the men are working and the lower wages , as wages at the mines and smelters are on a sliding scale that varies with price of copper . As result of these and other causes , for instance . Anaconda is producing copper at its various properties at the lowest operating cost in the history of the mines . But it also has to be remembered that overhead , interest and carrying charges on idle mines are falling on a smaller output , so that when charges per pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low as they would be at somewhat higher rates of operation . That a good part of the output will begin to be cut off in the next few months , if copper stays at 81,4 cents or lower , appears probable from a glance at the cost of producing copper at the mines that were in operation during last month , when world output was around 125,000 short tons of copper . These are operating costs before depreciation and do not include carrying charge on idle capacity or other indirect charges : of over 9 cents . 13,000 tons a month . or 156 000 tons a year are coming from mines in Russia . Japan and Australia This output is consumed in those countries and the mines for national reasons probably will be kept in operation This leaves monthly output of 31.500 produced at an operating cost of over 9 cents a pound that is coming on the world market , or about 25 ? , of the production . On this output an operating loss is being incurred at this time of more than a cent a pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costing between 8 and 9 cents a pound is produced at an operating cost of more than S , 5 cents a pound . IL is fairly certain that practically all of the unaccountedfor output , which comes largely from smaller mines , is produced at an operating cost of over 815 cents a pound . If these assumptions be correct , then fully 55,1- of the present world production of around 125,000 tons a month is being produced at an operating loss with copper Si:cents a pound , and 45 ' 1 , is competitive copper in the world market . At S to 8,4 cents a pound for copper , undoubtedly more than half the competitive production is being mined at an operating loss . With such the situation , it would seem that many of the mines will have to close down in the next few months should price of copper hold between S and 8% cents a pound . It would also seem advisable for those requiring copper and in a position to borrow money cheaply to buy copper around present levels even if they can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With present low money rates it would probably pay to carry copper two or three years if it can be obtained around 8 cents delivered .
