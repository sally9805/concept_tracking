THE agricultural adjustment pro-I gram is still in the pot , and he would be rash who would predict what the stew will be like when the cooking is done . But it contains ingredients that should be to the liking of liberal , radical , or fascist , and evil only to the old-time individualist . It is true that radicals have expressed nothing but distaste for the AAA stew , but perhaps they have overlooked the meat and concentrated their attention entirely on the dumplings . I mentioned the old-time individualist . Here I should like to insert an aside . Individualism is a thing close to the hearts and native to the traditions of America . Thoreau was an individualist , Walt Whitman was an individualist , Dreiser , Sherwood Anderson , and Robinson Jeffers ? each is an individualist in his own way . Our history has been an unsuccessful effort to realize individualism in a true and deep sense ? the right of man or woman to live his or her life freely and fully . We still cling stubbornly to that dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of political and economic opprobrium many of us feel an inner resentment . What we badly need is a new word for political economists to use in place of individualism in its technical sense . I suggest that we coin the word idiocrat for this purpose . It would mean , according to its origin , one who believes in the rule of unmitigated selfinterest , and acts accordingly , with notorious social and economic consequences . Idiocracy would be the domination or exploitation of many individuals by one , or by a small group , for selfish interests . This is the enemy , for it crushes the life out of individualism ; and the battle , in America , is not so much to set up any doctrinaire kind of collectivism as to give full play to individualism in the older sense , by whatever means may finally prove to be necessary . Moreover , idiocrat has an agreeable resemblance to idiot , and idiocracy to idiocy ; whereas to call a man an individualist merely confuses the issue ; nor does the term rugged make it any better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true abroad , where there has perhaps not been so passionate a devotion to this particular ideal ; but I think it is true in America . The primary method of the AAA to secure what might be called a living wage for farmers has been to curtail production . From the standpoint of fundamentals , this is probably all wrong . I say probably only because there is still a large amount of statistical work to be done before we can be sure how far wrong it is . But consider our own domestic needs for food alone . In discussions of the agricultural problem it is commonly pointed out that the capacity of the human stomach is limited , and that food production must be strictly bound by these limits . It may also be pointed out that Americans as a whole probably get as much food as they can eat . And again , the increase in our population is at a declining rate , and it is estimated that within a few decades there will no longer be any net increase at all . These three factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the production of food . Yet they do not tell the whole story . For if it is true that Americans get a sufficient total quantity of food , it is also true that a large proportion of them do not get enough of the socalled protective foods ? milk , vegetables , and fruits ? nor as much meat and eggs as would be desirable in a well-balanced dietary . In 1929 more than 21 per cent of the 271/2 million families in America had incomes under $1000 a year ; and it is practically certain that all of these families lived below the dietary danger line , subject throughout life to nutritional diseases in mild or acute forms . Altogether , 211/2 million , or more than 78 per cent of the total number of families , presumably did not have a diet closely approaching what modern nutritionists might call optimum . To attain such a dietary a family of four would have needed an izIcome of $3000 a year or more if an undue proportion of it was not to he spent for food ; and less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as high as that in 1929 . ( Standards for such a dietary , tentative but highly significant , correlated with cost figures , are given in Circular 296 , Bureau of Home Economics , U. S. Department of Agriculture , by Hazel K. Stiebeling and Medora M. Ward . ) But we do not now produce enough food to give Americans such a dietary if they could all afford it and were educated up to it . We should have been obliged to increase production of every food crop with the sole exception ofgrain for human consumption ? dairy cattle , beef cattle , hogs , sheep , poultry , vegetables , fruits , and of course animal feed crops . These necessary increases would range from 22 per cent to 282 per cent in individual cases ; and the total increase in farm acreage required would be 13.2 per cent over all the acreage we had in production for food crops in 1933 . This 13.2 per cent increase required for domestic consumption alone would amount to 41 million acres ? just about the acreage that is now supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into crops during the War , to supply foreign nations . In passing , it should be pointed out that the need for increased acreage at the highest dietary level would be due to the increased quantity of animal products in the dietary . A cannibal might make a filling meal off a pound loaf of bread . He might also make a meal off the choice cuts of a missionary . The latter would involve a much larger acreage , for the cannibal would obviously be consuming , at second hand , all the grain the missionary had eaten up to that unfortunate moment . In spite of the limitations of stomach size it would not be necessary for Americans to develop the capacity of a Diamond Jim Brady in order to consume the products of a considerably larger acreage . It could be done by enabling them to attain a really good dietary . Nor is it necessary to accept that full estimate of 41 million acres . If American agriculture could expand even by a little , farmers would consider it a godsend . This does not tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticking to fundamentals . For if America , perhaps the best fed nation in the world , badly needs an improved dietary , it would seem certain that many other nations must need it much more . We are less than 6 per cent of the world 's THE MEAT IN THE AGRICULTURAL STEW 243 population of 2 billion . Among that 2 billion there are not only many millions who suffer from the hidden hurtgcr of dietary deficiencies , but other millions who perish of slow or swift starvation from lack of food enough to keep their bodies going . How many of the latter there are is any man 's guess , but periodic news of famine in India or China might incline us to set the guess fairly high II All this naturally leads to another question . Farming is not devoted entirely to the production of food . It includes the production of cotton , wool , linen , and various other raw materials . Now suppose the American nation could lift itself up not only to a high dietary level , but also to a corresponding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of living , should we not find that agriculture did not produce enough to supply the raw materials needed for such a standard ? Would not a really high national standard of living necessitate an increase in acreage and production for agricultural products other than food ? We lack figures at present for a statistical basis ; but one may draw some conclusion from the general estimate in the study by the Brookings Institution , " America 's Capacity to Consume . " According to this estimate , if the 19.4 million American families whose incomes were less than $2500 a year in 1929 had all been raised to the $2500 level , they would have spent 40 per cent more for food than they actually spent in 1929 ; 65 per cent more for shelter and home maintenance ; 65 per cent more for attire and adornment ; and 115 per cent more for " other consumers ' goods and services . " Such an increase in the low-bracket incomes , though drastic in the light of presentconditions , is modest from the standpoint of fundamentals ; since $2500 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living for a family of several members . Yet it would involve a great demand for more goods . The figures have not been broken down to show what would be the increased demand , for example , for cotton and wool . But guesswork based on personal experience is not without a certain validity here . My own family is that of a middle-class professional man , pushed down by recent economic events to a rather low level . We could readily use , at a rough estimate , three times the quantity of clothing , household linen , curtains , rugs , and other textiles we now have or can afford ? and that without reveling in luxury . But there are a good many millions of families worse off than mine . How much more in the way of textile products could they use ? One may guess that the amount would be very large . The statement is sometimes made that the need for clothing is limited like the need for food ; one can use only so much . But the limitation here is considerably more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not only do families with low incomes have less clothing than they could use ; they also wear it to the ultimate limit of usefulness , and sometimes beyond . With a more liberal income the rate of discard and replacement is more rapid and changes for the sake of style are more readily made . Waste , in other words , is increased . But in this field material waste is psychological conservation ; for the inadequate wardrobe has destructive effects on one 's attitude toward life . Altogether , it would not seem farfetched to say that raising the national standard of living to a high level would necessitate even greater increases in the production of textile raw materials than in the production of food . And again , there is the rest of the world to he brought into the picture . We constitute only six per cent . What are the potential needs of the other ninetyfour per cent ? How much more cloth could the world 's tattered and miserably housed millions use if they could get it ? I have already said that a greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the acreage and production of agricultural crops in America . Possibly , however , no increased acreage would be required if the general productiveness of agriculture were raised to a sufficiently high level . This is the contention of agricultural scientists ? that we could produce far more on the acreage we now have , with fewer farmers , by making full use of existing technical knowledge . But what is possible in selected areas or on demonstration farms is not necessarily possible for agriculture as a whole ; there is always a great lag between the ideal and the average actuality . Nevertheless , there is this element of doubt as to the real need for increased acreage . For different reasons , there might also be some doubt as to the need for increased production ? in America ; for possibly other agricultural areas might be able to meet the world 's greatest potential need for food and raw materials better and more economically than we . These theoretical uncertainties emphasize the desirability of collecting more information than is now available on certain points . What has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agricultural expansion . This is the possibility continually stressed by Henry Ford and others of the salvationby-science , **33;1224;TOOLONG school of thought , of using farm products for industrial purposes to a far greater extent than is now the case . For example , a method that would make alcohol a more economicalmotor fuel than petroleum products might result in an enormous expansion in the production of corn . But on the other hand , the corn might not be raised by farmers . It might be produced by underlings of a vast Standard Alcohol Trust . The possibilities here outlined have nothing to do with reemployment and the raising of wages to the 1929 level . This has been stressed as an essential part of any permanent improvement in agricultural prosperity . But in 1929 American agriculture was already far on its way down the toboggan slide ; the depression was merely a sudden sharp dip in the slide , one of those dips that make the bottom fall out of the stomach . A return to 1929 conditions , that is , a jump in industrial prosperity to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agriculture faced by the necessity for drastic retrenchment . This is not to minimize the need for increased employment ; but a distribution of income quite unlike that which prevailed in 1929 would be an entirely different matter . The galvanizing force for agriculture would be a change in the status of all the lower eighty per cent of American families who in 1929 earned less than three thousand dollars ? a change that would bring them to the point where they could live like those immediately above them . All in all , it seems overwhelmingly probable that if an inventory of the world 's need for agricultural products to furnish a really good standard of living were placed over against an inventory of present production , item by item , the latter would be short . However , there would be individual exceptions to this . World wheat production , for example , rose to something like W2 billion bushels annually , which is at the rate of about one hundred and ten pounds for every man , woman , and child on earth , or a third THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would seem hardly possible to consume that much , taking into consideration the vast numbers of people who do not use wheat but rice as the foundation of the diet . In other words , there is always the possibility of having an actual world surplus of wheat , beyond reasonable need . But the same poverty that shuts the great majority off from a decent standard of living places a heavy emphasis on grain , which must necessarily be the chief food , sometimes almost the only food , of poor men . All this is true ? from the standpoint of fundamentals . But let anyone answer candidly how near he thinks America is to dealing with these fundamentals . How near are we to a forthright , single-minded effort to lift 80 per cent of the population up to the economic level of the top 20 per cent ? or rather , to the level of that great majority of the top 20 per cent who are not wealthy but merely moderately well off ? To suggest the practical possibility of such an effort in the near future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too deep ; we do not understand them ; we are afraid of them ; we shrink from them . We are not yet ready to make a vigorous , clean-cut attack on the problem from this standpoint . This fact made retrenchment ? a form of sabotage familiar in industry ? inevitable in the present agricultural program . Yet important as this part of the program is , it might still be considered as only a dumpling in the stew . III Perhaps the most thoroughgoing and astute left-wing critic of the agricultural program is Louis M. Hacker . Hacker 's thesis is that the American farmer is doomed , first because his agricultural plant is so heavily overcapitalized that he can not possibly AGRICULTURAL STEW 245 compete for foreign markets with farmers in new agricultural regions whose production costs are very much lower ; second , because American industry and finance are at the point in their historical development where they need vast foreign outlets for manufactured goods and credit ; and the goods and credit can be paid for only by greatly increased imports of agricultural products into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmer will be crushed under a flood of cheap products from abroad , to the end that industry and finance may prosper . His doom is inescapable peasantry . One must pay tribute to the grandeur of the prophecy . It makes the future stand out stark against a fateful sky . One sees the American farmer as a mute victim of ponderous forces moving with impersonal inexorability . He plods onward to his doom , a tragic figure . If the soundness of the doom theory be granted , escape would have been impossible so long as farmers stood alone ? isolated individuals , ignorant of deep economic currents and forces , speaking no common language , at the mercy of any organized groups that cared to exploit them . And this in the main has been the condition of farmers in America ( and for the most part , throughout the world ) . The Green Rising has had its splendors , but it has been sporadic , short-lived , limited in extent , and often narrow in aims . For the most part , rural understanding of economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding of these things ; and rural organization for wellthought-out objectives has been negligible compared with industrial and financial organization . There has never been any glue strong enough to keep the elements in most farm groups stuck together . But this situation is being reversed under the agricultural program . Not slowly bur rapidly , not in small groups but in gigantic groups , agriculture is being welded together in a manner and to a degree that would hardly have been dreamed of as possible at any time in the past . Starting from scratch at the beginning of 1933 , by the end of 1934 you have three million farmers signed up for adjustment contracts , and perhaps another million operating under marketing agreements . This is two-thirds of the total number of American farmers according to the 1930 census ; but those co-operating probably represent an even larger proportion of the total farm acreage in America than their numbers indicate . And all of this co-operation is for the purpose of carrying out a vast agricultural plan , national in scope , with international implications , and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the real meat of the situation . By comparison , the organization of labor in the United States has proceeded at a snail 's pace . In 1934 the membership of the American Federation of Labor , after fifty-three years of effort , was 2,608,000 . Add 500,000 members of the four railroad brotherhoods not affiliated with the A. F. of L. , and you have very nearly our total labor union strength . Figures are not available to show just what percentage of all eligible workers are members of labor unions , but it is very much less than the 66 per cent of farmers who within two years were co-operating for aims somewhat like the aims of union labor . This is surely a tribute to the astuteness and the energy of those responsible for formulating and administering agricultural policies . But even more significant is the fact that the economic education , the coherence , the articulateness , and the fighting spirit of these farmers are all apparently advancing at an accelerating pace . Of this there can be little doubt . If American farmers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of industry and finance , it becomes more and more questionable whether they will go like sheep to the slaughter , and more and more likely that they will put up a memorable fight . In a single season 24,000 farmer meetings were held in the Southern cotton belt . In a period of two months 1500 meetings were held in one small section of Texas . Thousands of other meetings have been held and are being held throughout the rural United States . These meetings have primarily centered on the various adjustment contracts for cotton , wheat , tobacco , corn , hogs , and on the marketing agreements that cover a considerable number of other commodities . Thus they come to grips with immediate economic problems and result in cooperative action ; and in the process the farmer 's economic horizon is widened . There has been another recent development which promises to go far beyond the contract meetings in its educational possibilities , although it grew directly out of them . When you start discussing a contract to reduce acreage , along with all your neighbors in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A hundred questions come up . " Why is it necessary to reduce acreage at all ? Why wo n't the market absorb current production ? Why is it that foreign markets have passed out of the picture ? Can they be restored , and if so , how ? What is the relation of the demand for farm products to factory payrolls and consumer incomes ? What is its relation to the dietary habits of the American people ? How much of the national income does the farmer get and how much is he entitled to ? More and more farmers are asking such questions . Finding how difficult they are to answer , more and more farmers are coming face to face with THE MEAT IN THE the fact of their own ignorance . As a result there is a spontaneous and rapidly growing demand for discussion meetings ; and field men say it promises to sweep over States and become a movement of very large proportions . At these meetings the appetite for facts and interpretations is reported to be voracious . In fact , field men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of economic issues believe it may hold bigger possibilities than anything that has happened in America in a long time . It is too early to predict what will be the outcome . Only a start has been made , chiefly in Texas , Oklahoma , Kansas , Utah , Colorado , and Illinois , with some of the land-grant colleges cooperating . But early as it is , there is already an eager demand for instruction in the technic of group discussions and an even more eager demand for discussion material on economic and social problems as they relate to agriculture . Present indications are , first , that the movement may become a major phenomenon in the rural fife of America ; second , that it may lead to a pretty thorough probing of economic issues in the light of to-day 's major political and economic points of view . The dynamic possibilities go beyond mere discussion . It must not be forgotten that back of the movement there is a growing solidarity of co-operation for purposes roughly similar to the aims of organized labor and a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of labor . And it must not be forgotten that if the number of farmers has steadily dwindled during the past few decades , their potential power has been correspondingly concentrated . To-day some 6 to 7 million farmers hold in their hands the life of 126 million Americans . This is a fact they will realize if they get to thinking about these things . Realizing AGRICULTURAL STEW 247 it , they should object to being driven like sheep to their doom . There are dangers . The whole movement might readily be hand-fed and put through its training paces by a government bent on fascism . Or it might become a sleek national club directed by the more prosperous land-owning farmers interested only in fortifying their own position . If agriculture is capable of producing enough vigorous clear-headed rebels and if the movement is genuinely democratic , it will escape these dangers and may do extraordinary things . The two if 's are large and momentous ones . IV The farmer is often pictured as one whose instinct is to produce in order that he may feed , clothe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view he hates to cut down production deliberately . Whether this is true or not , he can not under the current economic system allow the ancient beneficent instinct of producers to guide his farming operations . He must produce , not to supply the world 's needs , but only to sell to the world what it can buy at a price sufficient to meet his costs and give him in addition enough to buy the necessities of life in his turn . If he produces more than the world can buy at this price the excess pushes the price down ; and if the price goes low enough he can no longer produce at all , because he can not meet even his costs . He is then translated from farmer into pauper and must either find other work or go on the relief rolls . The economic struggle may be thought of as centering round three simple equations . The farmer 's alleged instinct is to satisfy the equation : Production= Need If he were allowed to do this production would have to be greatly expan ded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need ? or as we might put it : Production Need But this equation has no immediate significance in our economic organization . What the farmer must do actually is to produce just enough to satisfy the market demand at a necessary price ? this necessary price being high enough to include a profit which will enable him to supply his own needs . That is , he must satisfy the equation : Production = **25;1259;TOOLONG But it is incontrovertible that for a good many years this equation was not being satisfied in the American economy . We had in America a condition in which production was ruinously greater than **28;1286;TOOLONG , because of the loss of foreign markets ? that is : Production **25;1316;TOOLONG There are several ways to correct this and bring the equation in balance . It is useless to drive the price down in order to increase demand , for two reasons ? first , because we soon reach a point where the price is lower than the necessary price ? and this has actually been the condition in American agriculture ; second , because no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the demand can be increased only by a limited amount ; for the hulk of the products are bought by the bulk of the people , who must have other things besides agricultural products ; and their poverty is so great that low food prices merely enable them to buy a little more of these other things . The balancing operation then must be performed primarily on the other side of the equation ? that is , production must be reduced by taking out land or reducing the number of farmers or both . This tends to raise the price on the other side of the equation until it comes nearer to the necessary price . And the price ( or more accurately , the return to the farmer ) may be increased also by artificial devices such as imposing a tax on the processing of farm products by manufacturers and others , and then giving the proceeds of the tax to the farmer in the form of a benefit payment . Both of these methods were adopted under the Agricultural Adjustment Act . The acreage in food crops was reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hogs was reduced . There have been processing taxes , benefit payments to farmers , and marketing agreements made for the purpose of boosting prices . A slight beginning has been made in taking marginal farmers out of production ; but the social problems involved here are difficult to solve , and it is only a beginning . So far , the weight of evidence is that these methods are working . Both the gross income and the purchasing power ( that is , the net income ) of farmers have been increased , and we are nearer to balancing the equation Production **26;1343;TOOLONG than we were before the agricultural adjustment effort started . As a result , farmers have felt a new surge of economic well-being . There are other possible methods of weighting the second half of the equation . For example , the margin of profit might be raised by reducing costs of production , in three ways : ( 1 ) deflating farm values ; ( 2 ) bringing down the cost of things farmers have to buy , including machinery , fertilizers , building materials , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) increasing productivity both per acre and per man-hour THE MEAT IN THE AGRICULTURAL STEW 249 by improving farm practices . The first and the last of these methods at least are within the scope of an agricultural adjustment program , and there is no intrinsic reason why they should not be given considerably more emphasis in the future . In fact , long-time planning for better land use is becoming a more and more important part of the present program ; but here too the problems are large and complex and they can not be solved rapidly . Two other methods of weighting the second half of the equation must be mentioned . One is to increase demand by recapturing foreign markets . A great deal of thought and effort is now being spent on this ; but at best it is a slow process ; and in the face of the present hell-bent determination of many countries to be self-sustaining , it is doubtful how far the most heroic efforts can succeed . Certainly we can not hope to export goods without accepting imports in return to pay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only imports we could accept in sufficient quantities , in an industrial economy , would be not manufactured but agricultural products ? which would accomplish the reverse of what the farmer wishes and bring on Hacker 's doom . The other method is inflation . Evidence indicates that the government 's modified inflation policy has played a considerable part in increasing farm returns . But it works both ways , increasing the cost of everything the farmer buys as well as the price of what he sells . That many of the devices used to bring our equation into balance arc fantastic and cynical ? from the standpoint of fundamentals ? has been said many times . We reduce production in the face of bitter need , instead of giving need the means wherewith to buy . We rob Peter the consumer by means of a processing tax in order to pay Paul the producer a benefit . Such ironies are unavoidable in the process of balancing this particular equation on which our whole economic system is based ; and one who believes in the equation is the last person in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ironies it involves . They have been acutely on the minds of some of the agricultural adjusters . But in general these men have worked out a shrewd procedure to wrestle the equation into shape for the benefit of farmers , and their sufficient answer to objections is that the procedure seems to be doing what it set out to do . The truth is that at present America is in somewhat the position of a man who wants to play chess but is limited to following the rules of checkers . So he tries to devise some sort of hybrid game that will be a cross between the two . It may turn out to be a good game ? hut chess devotees doubt it and old-fashioned checker fans want nothing to do with it . What we are apparently trying to do with the present liberal program as a whole is to reconcile our two basic equations , Production=Need and Production **25;1371;TOOLONG . This could be done only through a third equation : **25;1398;TOOLONG =Need We should then obviously have an equality all round , that is : **25;1425;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Radicals believe it can not . They believe that as long as profits are a necessary factor , need must always be far greater than demand-at-the-necessary price , and that if we really want to satisfy the equation Production = Need we shall have to leave out the profit factor and concentrate single-mindedly on the two terms of that equation . They argue that if we do this all our productive energies and every technical and scientific advance would have to be utilized to the limit to catch up with the world 's unsatisfied needs . Thus there is a basic cleavage in point of view ; and radical criticism of the agricultural program is based flatly on the second point of view . Meanwhile it is perhaps fair to say that an increasing proportion of the American people as a whole are on the fence . Some , including the idiocrats , will stick out for the profit factor until the bitter end . But an increasing number are coming to the point where they do not much care whether we keep the profit factor or not . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they would rather keep the profit method than not if it can be made to work better than it has been working , because they are used to it and they are afraid of what might be involved in making a change . It is this large group who cheer on the present effort and prevent a more radical experiment . But so far as agriculture is concerned , there is reason to believe that a much needed job is being done from any point of view except that of the idiocrat . Under any system but an idiocracy , whether some form of liberalized capitalism , fascism , socialism , or communism , we should have to have planned agricultural production , planned use of our land resources , and close co-operation of farmers on a national scale . Farmers would have to learn to think of their problems in relation to national and world needs . They would have to be able to co-ordinate their efforts wit . those of other economic groups . They would have to be able to speed up or slow down or shift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for under any system it is doubtful if a perfect plan would spring full-grown from the brain of Jove at half-past ten . There would be mistakes , and there would have to be modifications and revisions , and a flexible , responsive agriculture would be absolutely necessary . And finally , under any system but a dictatorship farmers would have to be able to run their affairs democratically . Such things as these are by no means easy to achieve . But they are being brought about through the agricultural program . The measure of the shortcomings of Henry A. Wallace has not yet been taken ; but whatever these may prove to be , in the measure of his assets are great probity and patience , no little breadth of mind , a deep faith in democracy and in the possibility of orderly progress through democratic methods , and a shrewd knowledge of the psychology of farmers . Never has agriculture in America been so close to conscious cohesion as under Wallace 's leadership . The achievement is not one to belittle , even though deep problems have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where its policy is wholly concerned with getting for farmers the benefits enjoyed by capitalist industry . When and by what means farmers may be persuaded that their fortunes ultimately depend on establishing the equation Production = Need is an unanswerable question . Enforced nationalism will drive us in that direction ; since without foreign markets the only way we can avoid scrapping a large part of the agricultural and industrial plant is to enable our own people to absorb all we can produce . But in order to move in that direction we should have to begin as Wallace has begun ? by making it possible for millions of independent units to act with a coordinated point of view and aim . A strong wind from the left would blow away the ironical details of the present program . The underlying structure would remain .
