Few of the rosy romantics who read Austin Dobson , collect bisque statuets of Pierrot &; Columbine and attend lectures on the 17th Century harlequinade like to remember that there exists in the U. S. today a vivid healthy parallel of the true commedia dell ' arte . Like the commedia , the Burlesque Show is extemporaneous , its libretto an assembly of long-remembered " bits " that have never been formally written down . Like the commedia , Burlesque has developed a cast of traditional characters with formalized costumes . The tramp , the Jew , the policeman , the soubrette and the straight man are as persistently unvarying as Harlequin , Pierrot , Columbine and the Captain were 250 years ago . Like the commedia , Burlesque is a theatre of and for the people , cheap , artless and dirty . But , unlike the vanished commedia , Burlesque has continued its raffish existence against the competition of cinema and radio through the ministrations of a new character , possibly the U. S. 's only original contribution to the drama : the strip woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are called in the trade ) do not dance , and the ability to sing is by no means an essential . They stalk about the stage , exercising blandishments and removing as many clothes as local authorities will permit . They are largely responsible for the fact that , with eight empty first class theatres in Manhattan , three burlesque houses on 42nd Street alone are jampacked nightly . <P> Last week Variety , famed theatrical weekly which long frowned upon this type of quasi-naked performance , took cognizance of the importance of the burlesque stripper by sending Cecelia Ager , its star woman reporter , to interview the highest paid , best-known stripper in Burlesque . The navel of svelte Italianate Anne Corio is as well known to a large section of the public as the nose of Jimmy Durante . <P> Newshawk Ager met Miss Corio , who in private life is the respected wife of Producer Emmett Callahan , in the wings after her act , followed her to her dressing room , watched her put on dark stockings , white net panties , a peach satin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemise , a pink silk slip , a long-sleeved , high-necked black dress , a black hat and long kid gloves . " Thus , " wrote Reporter Ager , " does a strip artist in her private life get even . " <P> Stripper Corio explained her principles : " I do n't like to be called a Stripper . In fact it absolutely galls me . But as long as they give me the money , that 's all I look forward to . ... Why should I give up my percentage of the gross for $100 a week and glory ? * . . . Where are all the Broadway beauties now ? When I finish I 'll have a bankroll . . . <P> " Make yourself as feminine looking as you can . Go in for a lot of frills , furs , ruffles , and parasols . Always put everything you have into your work to put it over . . . . Do n't take off your panties ; it makes a girl 's figure look prettier to have those little gadgets on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect so much from you on the road . New York audiences just want to see how much you 'll take off . ... I love New England best of all . It 's so easy to please . You do n't have to do much in New England because they have n't had it .
