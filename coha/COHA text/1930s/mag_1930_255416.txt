Historic is Lookout Mountain near Chattanooga , with one foot in Tennessee and one in Georgia . Here the Union soldiers tumbled the greycoats into retreat in the Battle Above the Clouds ; here , last year , shrewd Garnet Carter , owner of Fairyland Club , built the first Tom Thumb golf course , complicating an ordinary 18-hole putting course with ingenious hazards . Last week to Fairyland went putters from many corners of the U. S. to roll balls through hollows , to carom them from banks , down tunnels , over dishpan water hazards and around basket-size sand-traps in the first national Tom Thumb championship. * <P> Some putters from Jacksonville , Fla. were smartest . They came two weeks before the tournament started and putted round and round the Fairyland course , where every hole is named for a fairy story with little statues of the characters - gnomes , animals , little people-as hazards , direction posts , decoration . By long practice the people from Jacksonville learned to play Cinderella , to kill Red Riding Hood , to fool Little Miss Muffet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot too , but they were rattled by competition with the outland contestants . Impulsive Chinese Grace Moy of Brooklyn arrived in her car late one evening and went right out to play . She was up early in the morning to play some more . Her scores were bad . She said : " If I do n't break par this round I 'll jump in the goldfish pool . " She did not break par . She did not jump in the bowl . <P> A great crowd followed Ernest Fossa , 14 , champion Tom Thumber of Massachusetts . Fossa hurried his shots , took sixes on the last two holes . <P> Midget Cigarsalesman Herbert Barnett ( 32 yrs. , 50 lb. , 30 in. ) did not have his own clubs with him . He had to play around with a 35-in. putter , did badly . He said : " What could you expect ? The only full-size article I use is a Meditation Cigar . " <P> In the end . the smart Jacksonvillains triumphed . After four 18-hole rounds ( par , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 75 to 80 on real golf courses won the $2.000 first prize for men with 223 . Mrs. J. E. Rankin who won the $2,000 for the best lady was from Jacksonville too . Her score was 241 . Putter Newton Coggins from Jacksonville and Mrs. R. L. Stone of Chattanooga were runners-up . <P> Garnet Carter has part interest in patent rights on the use of cottonseed hulls or other " comminuted flocculent vegetable material " as putting greens ( TIME , July 14 ; Aug. n ) . His patents on hollow-log and other hazards are still pending . A great rival-Miniature Golf Courses of America Inc. - had sprung up to compete with his Tom Thumb Golf . Wisely they compromised on the market : to Miniature Golf , the indoor courses ; to Tom Thumb the open spaces . Latest Department of Commerce figures for this fast-growing U. S. business put the total investment at $325,000,000 for 30,000 courses .
