txt Drunken Drivers a Menace . To the Editor of The New York Times : It was good to see Tus TIMES give space to Edgar C. Bross 's letter about " The Man Behind the Wheel . " The drunken automobile driver has never been sufficiently punished . The forfeiture of his license and also his car to the State would help matters . The large type in his school books which warned him of the effects of strong drink he has long since forgotten . He is at best a zigzag driver , making the hearts of those he passes on the highway palpitate with fear . He is a very poor specimen of man . kind to be in charge of an automobile and laughs and grins as he rides , He is always hiccoughing his words , conversing voluminously and without meaning and with eyes halfblinded , unable to focus more than a hundred feet ahead . He has brought sorrow to many and should be penalized 100 per cent . EDWARD G. EKDAHL . Rockville Centre , N. Y. , June 27 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
