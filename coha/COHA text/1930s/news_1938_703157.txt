txt The Democratic leadership moved ahead of Mayor La Guardia in the New York City transit situation today as John J. Dunnigan , majority leader in the Senate , announced that he had called- for a joint public hearing by the Public Service Committees of both houses on all New York City transit legislation . The effect of the hearing will be threefold : It will provide for the opposition to the Seabury-Berle transit unification plan , and the opponents of the move to abolish the Transit Commission , a forum before which to voice their stand . - It will bring before the Legislature a definite stand on the part of the Mayor as to what he will do with the powers now vested in the commission if they are transferred to a city agency . It will solve a problem now perplexing the legislative leaders as to what they should do about the extension of the five-cent fare clause affecting the city 's independent subway system . After the clallse expires this year the subways would have to be put on a " self-supporting basis " unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet asked for an extension . Mayor Not Yet Committed The Mayor is not publicly cornmitted to either of the two principal bills , now before the Legislature , which would affect the Transit Commission . The first is the Desmond bill to abolish the commission and transfer its- powers to the Board of Transportation . The second is the Mitchell bill , transferring only the unification powers from the commission to the Board of Estimate and leaving the rest of the commission alone . The city , to date , has sent only three minor bills to the Legislature , 1 and these arrived in the past two 1 drys . The situation is one that might prove embarrassing to the legislative leaders . If the Legislature failed to extend the 5-cent-fare clause on the grounds that the city had failed to ask for it , the Mayor would charge " callous disregard " of the city 's interests . Emergency Tax Expires July 1 The same is true , it is charged , of the extension of the city 's emergency taxing power , under which the relief taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The emergency taxing power , which has been re-enacted yearly , expires again on July 1 , and no bill has reached Albany asking for its continuance . The Mayor obtained an extension of the 5-cent-fare clause three years ago , although his supporters argued privately that no extension was necessary , as a subway system could not be made self-supporting by leg= islative mandate . If the fare was raised , revenues would be less and the losses greater , it was said then . Senator Dunnigan , in his statement , made it clear that he was opposed to transferring the power over unification to any city agency . He contended that the SeaburyBerle plan would put on the city burdens for many years to come , city . His statement follows : " In order that nothing may happen-to -- in-any manner- endanger the five-cent fare in New York City , I have requested that public hearings be held on all the bills now before the Legislature which would affect the transit situation in the greater city . " Among the bills is one which would transfer the jurisdiction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Transportation . The argument advanced for its purpose is to further the policy of home rule . " Against that argument , however , is the stated policy of the State of New ltork over a period of , more than fifty years , a policy supported by Republican as well as Democratic Governors , which provides for State police powers to the private-railroad companies . If the Transit , ' Commission 's " duties were transferred ' to- the Board of Transportation , : the city , although a party to these contracts , . would be given the power to administer those contracts .. " The result from such a situation is readily apparent when consideration is given to the fact that the Board of Transportation operates the city 's Independent Subway System in competition with the existing lines run by the private companies under these contracts . " Obviously , if the duties of the Transit Commission were transferred to the Board ' of Transportation , the State police power would be nullified entirely . I think , if for no ' other reason , a public hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out these facts . " Another bill would take from the Transit Commission-the jurisdiction over unification of the city 's rapid transit lines and place the powers heretofore . vested in it with the Board of Estimate of the City of New York . Only last , year the Transit Commission reviewed a plan of unification - proposed by the city administration which , . I-am informed , contained provisions that would have burdened the city for many years to come . " If the Transit Commission had not been acting in that instance as a State police body , it might well be that that plan would have been ' approved and its burdens saddled on the people of the City of New . York . " If the Board of Estimate were to have sole power of unification without any check ; almost any kind of plan might be adopted and possibly a plan that , would kill the fivecent fare forever . This feature in itself should call for public hearings so that all those interested in unification of the ' rapid transit lines would be given an opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " For these reasons I have asked ? that joint public hearings be held on all measures which have ? been introduced affecting transportation in the City of New York. - I will insist upon these public hearings because I want- to make sure that New York City 's five-zent fare- is maintained . " and that ' if the Transit Commission be exercised over transit in the cities of the State . had not been acting as a " State po . These police powers are based I lice body " the plan might have on the fact that transit in the been approved and saddled on the State , no matter what locality it is in , or whether wholly within a city , is a ' matter ? of State regulation for the benefit of all the people in the State . " The Board of Transportation is a body entirely under the control of the local administration in the City of New York . Appointment of its members is made by the Mayor of the city . The Transit Commis sion is a body whose members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Senate . " Included among the functions of the Transit Commission is the administration of the contracts beenactment of this measure is that tween the City of New York and
