The new U. S. Ambassador to the Court of St. James , able Joseph Patrick Kennedy , stepped off the Manhattan onto an admiral 's barge at Plymouth in the middle of the night last week , reached London before dawn , alighted from his sleeping car at 7:15 a. m. to be greeted by top-hatted officials . <P> At the new U. S. Embassy in Grosvenor Square , the Ambassador cocked his feet up on his highly-polished desk , to the satisfaction of Britons who always thought the " English gentleman " manners of his predecessor , the late Robert Worth Bingham , somewhat pretentious . Joe Kennedy proceeded to go for a ride on a " rented horse , " played golf ( see p. 28 ) , shook hands with Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain . <P> " You can take it from me that I have no precise instructions from the President , " he confided . " You ca n't expect me to develop into a statesman overnight . . . . By 1940 I believe there will be regular passenger and freight airlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the first passenger myself . . . . Right now the average American is n't as interested in foreign affairs as he is in how he 's going to eat and whether his insurance is good . Some , maybe , even are more interested in how Casey Stengel 's Boston Bees are going to do next season .
