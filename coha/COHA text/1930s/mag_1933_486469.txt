NEW Yana- , THURSDAY , DECEMBER 11 , 1902 . The Week . Senator Lodge has introduced a bill to establish the gold standard in the Philippines . By refusing at the last session to concur in the House bill on this subject , he and his colleagues in the Senate have made themselves morally responsible for the loss of a very large sum ( estimated at upwards of $1,000 , - 000 ) by the Philippine Government , not to mention the losses incurred by private individuals through the decline in silver . Mr. Lodge and his colleagues are quoted as saying that the decline in silver was wholly unexpected by them Of course , it was . Nobody supposes that they intended to deprive Gov . Taft of any part of the revenue of the islands They thought they understood the subject on which they were legislating , bul they failed to take account of the fact that silver has been on the down grade , with very slight interruption , ever since 1873 . Or , perhaps , they thought that it could not possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were passing the Philippine Government bill . They left out of their reckoning the possible action of countries still on the silver standard  --  the Straits Settlements , Siam , China , and Mexico . But it is the unexpected which happens . In 1893 silver declined fifteen cents per ounce within three days after the announcement that Inclin , had demonetized it . What took place then might occur at any time when any country of equal importance should take similar action , The only country of equal magnitude still on the silver basis is China , and her attitude is uncertain . That of Mexico is uncertain also , for it is hardly credible that she should continue to do business on the principles of the blind pool as outlined in the decree of President Diaz of November 25 . The reasons why she has not sooner abandoned the silver standard are that she is again the largest silver-producing country in the world , as she was in the time of the Spanish occupation , and also that the adoption of the single gold standard would involve an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cullom , by calling up the French reciprocity treaty on Monday , made a striking demonstration of the difference between reciprocity in posse ( i. e , in the President 's message ) and reciprocity in esse e. , in the Senate ) . Everybody is willing to assent to the principle in the abstract , or " when conditions shall permit , " or " whenever it may seem expedient " ; but the moment you suggest an actual , a negotiated reciprocity treaty you have Depew protesting for the glovers , Hoar vociferous for the pinchbeck-jewelry industry , Lodge and Aldrich variously darkening counsel and making the worse the better reason . The scene was instructive . It showed that the Republicans of the Senate are unwilling even to discuss any matter that involves tariff reduction , and it proves to the many Republicans who have voted for serious reconsideration of the tariff schedules that they have been swindled out of their votes . It buries one spadeful deeper that hoary fraud , " the tariff revised by its friends . " Senator Cullom says he will call up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will do so . Every time the ultra-protectionists rise to that lure they will look more selfish as men and more ridiculous as statesmen . Congressman Littlefield 's so-called anti-Trust bill is free from Constitutional objections , and it offers the chance of taking one step towards the control of corporations engaged in interstate commerce which are large enough to be dangerous . All economists of note who have dealt with the Trust question in public discussion are agreed that the first step to be taken is to secure publicity of the affairs of Trusts , and that the proper method of controlling them is by the taxing power . In order to obtain data for the exercise of the latter power the former is a needed preliminary . Mr. Littlefield 's bill provides that every corporation doing an interstate business and having more than $500,000 capital shall file with the Interstate Commerce Commission each year a statement of its capital stock and debt , with all particulars , the value of the property represented by the same , and the market value , together with the earnings , expenses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wages paid . The Interstate Commerce Commission is to have power also to examine the officers of the corporation under oath touching these matters . In short , the same powers are to be exercised in obtaining facts as are now exercised in. obtaining the facts from railroads engaged in interstate commerce , and by most of the States in dealing with local railroads . A tax of 1 per cent . per annum is to be imposed on so much of the capital stock of such corporations as consists of water . There is no reason why this bill should be called an anti-Trust bill , except that the Trust promoters are very much opposed to it , as the railroad men were to the Interstate Commerce bill when that was first proposed . Mr. Littlefield 's bill has been reported favorably by the sub-committee of the House Judiciary-Committee , and will no doubt be agreed to by the whole committee . It will then become the leading measure of the present session . We trust that Governor-elect Penny-packer of Pennsylvania will hasten to explain away the latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for which Mr. Pennypacker alone , we think , is fitted , for he was the one who first discovered in Quay a greater statesmanship than that of Webster or Clay . Quay favors the admission of Arizona and New Mexico as States . He so yearns to number these Territories among the Federal sisterhood that it appears he wrote a letter advising that Democratic victories be arranged in each . This was in order to attract Democratic votes to the Statehood project . Quay 's Republican associates opposed the admission of these Territories , but , Quay stood firm as a rock . It caused comment , but what cared he ? Now he is to join with the Democrats in a minority report , for the committee has reported a bill granting Statehood to Oklahoma alone . Somebody at Washington has suggested that Quay had some other motive than that founded upon his exalted statesmanship . Testimony before a Senate committee has even been raked up , indicating that the value of a mine in Arizona owned by a brother of Senator Penrose of Pennsylvania would be largely increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unkindly inference that perhaps other great men in Pennsylvania have a finger in the pie . These are the cruel rumors which we trust Mr. Pennypacker , Quay 's official defender , will hasten to explain away . Secretary Hitchcock 's warning against the palpable land frauds in the West , together with the discoveries made in the investigations of the Federal grand jury now in session at Omaha , serves to attract attention to a disgraceful state of wholesale swindling in the disposition of the public domain . The actual settler , the man who would turn the sod and plant the seed , has been forced out of the open range by the covetous owners of cattle and sheep . The frauds by which they have sought control have been glaring and unconcealed . At first- they attempted to scare the settlers by means of hostile demonstrations . His crops were destroyed , his stock driven off , and he was threatened with personal violence . But where one settler was forced out of the contest another took his place . There was always a settler looking over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domain . It has been a common thing for the stockman of the West to fence up thousands of acres that ddi not belong to him . An end to this sort of robbery was inevitable . The cattlemen and their rivals , the sheepmen , sought to obtain a quasi-title to their land by a species of entry in which they were assisted by the cowboys in their employ . Every herder has entered his name as a homesteader , and he has an assurance that his claim of " residence " will be sworn to by some other cowboy , who will expect the same service in return . This is trifling compared with the swindling of the Government that has gone on under the " widow 's claim " provisions . A widow of a soldier of the civil war may take up a claim without actual residence , obtaining a. deed from the Government at the expiration of five years . On this basis rest many of the most patent frauds . Agents have secured the signatures of widows all over the Middle West who , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed to prove up their claims five years hence They have received or are to receive about $150 for their service . The cattle companies and the syndicates operating for them are to be the beneficiaries ; and in the end will obtain , unless the deals are frustrated , vast areas at a merely nominal sum . It is estimated that during the past year in Nebraska alone , where the movement has been discovered as being most noticeable , the fraudulent entries have amounted to 1,000,000 acres . Congress should act , and make it impossible for a single acre of the public domain to go to individual owners except through the actual residence of a homesteader on 160 acres for five years , and his improvement of the land . It is something of a shock to learn that " the President 's friends " at Washington are a little worried about the delegates to the Republican National Convention to be held in 1904 . We had supposed that the President and his friends felt as serene and comfortable about these delegates as if they were all elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ munching sandwiches , and figuring out the patronage to be distributed in the beautiful spring days of 1905 . But we know now that the contrary is true , for our information is as nearly official as information about delegates ever is . Mr. L. T. Michener , formerly of Indiana , and still a political power in that State though now a resident of Washington , has let the cat out of the bag . A few days ago he wrote about thirty letters to knowing persons in Indiana asking their views " It is believed , " he said , " that Senator Hanna will try to get the Presidential nomination in 1904 . Some of the President 's friends are a little uneasy about it . Do you think Hanna could take Indiana away from Roosevelt  --  or Fairbanks ? " And the worst of it is , the replies thus far received do not especially tend to quiet that little uneasiness of the President 's friends . If Fairbanks is a candidate , he can have the delegates , the replies declare with striking unanimity . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . But there is a crumb of comfort ? Hanna says he does not " want the job " ; so perhaps it makes no difference about the Indiana delegates . The announcement that Major Edwin F Glenn , Fifth Infantry , of water-cure fame , is to be tried once more , proves in a gratifying way that the War Department has again been stung into action by those advocates of humanity who have been termed calumniators of the army . It is all the more apropos in view of President Roosevelt 's inclusion in his message of his stump-speech defence of the army . Major Glenn 's first trial for administering the water cure resulted in his conviction , and punishment by the ridiculous fine of $50 . His second trial , it is reported , is the result of his having casually chronicled the fact that he had had several natives lulled for misleading an American column . Apparently the circumstances of this killing were too much even for Secretary Root to stomach . Hence , Gen. Davis is to formulate charges and try the gallant Major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first trial , Major Glenn 's case is a particularly flagrant one , because he went to the Philippines in 1900 , after the hard fighting was over . His offences could not , therefore , be charged to nervous exhaustion , due to campaigning with an insidious foe , or explained in any other way than as committed in cold blood . Two of the officers , by the way , who were accused at the same time with Major Glenn , Lieut . Conger and Surgeon Cook , have never been tried , despite the promise of the President that every incriminated officer should be put on trial . The Baltimore News has been testing some of the valuable information sent to the press from the Bureau of Statistics at Washington . The particular line of investigation followed by the News relates to our trade with China , the remarkable growth of which is set forth in the statistics . Thus , it is shown that the imports into China from the United States , as computed by Chinese authorities themselves , have grown from 5 , - 093,182 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase of 350 per cent . in six years . According to the same authority , the increase of imports from Great Britain during the same time was only 25 per cent. , and that of Russia only 60 per cent . This exhibit , showing the advantage of having a neighboring tradingstation , was calculated to encourage everybody who had favored the taking of the Philippines for commercial rather than humanitarian purposes . But the editor of the News thought that it would - be well to look a little farther into the subject , and , being of a suspicious nature , he inquired , first , why the year 1895 had been selected as a starter . The reason was , that the exports from the United States to China in that year were exceptionally small , being only $3,603,840 . They were nearly twice as great in the following year , 1896 , and three times as great in 1897 , or $11,924,433 . Of the great gain of 350 per cent . in trade with China since 1895 , 230 per cent . had taken place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But by going back to the eighties other facts of considerable pertinence were discovered . In 1886 our exports to China were twice as great , and in 1891 two and a half times as great , as they were in 1895 , the year selected as the datum line by the statistician at Washington . His suspicions being confirmed thus far , the editor took up the published statistics of our own Bureau , and there he found that in the four years from June 30 , 1897 , to June 30 , 1901 , our expdrts to China actually decreased from $12,000,000 to $10,500,000 . This fact , if it has any bearing at all on the Philippines question , should teach us to rely more upon humanitarian than upon commercial results to justify us for what we have done , and to look to an approving conscience rather than to our pockets for our final reward . Gov . Odell 's voluntary statement that the Legislature will not be allowed any direct interference in the matter of the Pennsylvania tunnel franchise is of great interest for more reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking for that body  --  a place hitherto occupied by that peerless statesman , Mr. Thomas Collier Platt . That gentleman , by the way , recently declared that the Legislature should interfere , and punish the recalcitrant Aldermen by taking their power away or by abolishing them altogether . Apparently , therefore , the Legislature has two dictators . We say , apparently , for as a matter of fact Benjamin B. Odell is the real boss , and not the feeble , broken-down politician from Owego . If this is so evidently the case , . what is the necessity for reelecting Platt to the Senate simply in order that he may keep up the pretence that he and he alone still owns the Legislature ? The Schenectady militiaman who was expelled from the Painters ' Union for serving with his company has secured an injunction from the Supreme Court at Albany , restraining the union from depriving him of his rights as a member . His suit carries also ' a collateral claim for wages during the time he has been idle because of his expulsion , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not touch the main issue  --  whether a labor union may put itself in an attitude deliberately hostile to the power of the State to protect itself . The complaint appears to assume that a union may make its own rules . It could , for example , refuse , to admit all men under or over a certain height , or put a. clause in its constitution forever barring left-handed men , or members of the Seventh-day Baptist Church . All the injunction in the case of Militiaman Potter assumes is that a labor union is bound to administer its own rules fairly , and not to change them without due notice , and then only by regular process . It is held that Potter was expelled contrary to the constitution and laws of the union . The broad question of the legal responsibility of labor unions is hardly opened by this suit . The next step would be to test the complaint of a non-member who has made a contract in view of union rules . An award of damages to Potter would advance the day when labor organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies doing a collective business . The recent report on national finance presented to the Chamber of Commerce by Mr. J. Harsen Rhoades embraced three subjects of the highest importance . The first deals with the maintenance of parity of all kinds of money , and recommends that the Secretary of the Treasury be empowered to make gold and silver dollars interchangeable at the Treasury . The present law requires the Secretary to maintain parity , but does not indicate any method or provide any means of doing so . The recommendation of the Chamber of Commerce ( which ratified the report ) is that the simplest of all methods for maintaining parity be adopted  --  by giving the holders of silver dollars the option of exchanging them for gold ones if they desire . They have this option now as regards the subsidiary coins . The halves , quarters , and nickels thus hold a preferred place over the " standard silver dollar , " so called because it is not a standard  --  locus a non Zucendo . This is one of the oddities of our patchwork monetary system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the solecism corrected . His original bill for that purpose is now a part of the Fowler bill . It would , no doubt , pass by a good majority if it were placed before the House distinct from other measures . Connected with this are two minor suggestions , which need not to be particularly discussed now ? one calling for more subsidiary coins , and the other opposing any further coinage of silver dollars from the bullion in the Treasury . Another feature of the report of prime importance is the recommendation that the Secretary be authorized to use his own discretion as to depositing the money of the general fund in banks , and that he be authorized to accept State and municipal bonds as security therefor . Mr. Jacob H. Schiff , one of the signers of the Committee 's report , dissented briefly from this recommendation , not because he thought that the Government 's money would be unsafe in such cases , but because the public deposits might be used to serve political ends . But this objection lies against the law as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks , and for party purposes , has been repeatedly brought against the head of the Treasury in times past . Secretaries Sherman , Folger , Fairchild , Windom , and Gage were thus accused by political opponents , and without any foundation for the charges . Our system being what it is , this evil , if it be an evil , will continue , whether the special security required for the deposits be one thing or another , and whether interest be paid by the banks or not . A change in the existing Sub-Treasury law seems to be impending , and it can not come too soon . Just as Vermont is leaving the prohibition ranks and New Hampshire seems likely to do the same , the great Cana-than province of Ontario has passed what may be called a resolution in favor of the suppression of the saloon . The effect of Thursday 's vote is moral only , for the referendum was held under conditions which made impossible a technical victory for the Prohibitionists . It was required that they should poll 212,700 votes for the measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general election of 1898 . When it is remembered that the vote on any abstract measure is always far less than the vote for a man , it will be seen that for the Prohibitionists to vote at all was in the nature of a forlorn hope . Provided those opposed to prohibition , plus the stay-at-homes , were a majority of the vote of 1898 , they might view with equanimity the largest plurality for prohibition . It is estimated that the Prohibitionists had a majority of 50,000 of the votes cast last week , but the polling was comparatively light , and the Prohibitionist vote fell short of the arbitrary figure set for it . Out of fifteen cities nine , including Toronto , voted for prohibition , so that it must be admitted that the anti-saloon people made a gallant fight . One can not help seeing a certain Machiavellian cunning in Minister Ross 's handling of the whole matter . He has ingeniously contrived that his province shall have the moral satisfaction of voting against the saloon , without the practical inconvenience of being deprived of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original form is a personal tri umph for Mr. Balfour . The measure will be little modified in the Lords , and England will for the first time have a uniform system of primary education , and an organization which is empowered to deal with the preffsing matter of public secondary education . The system , considered as a system , seems workable , and even the Liberals will feel that it is better than the former condition . That the Balfour scheme can last long in its present form we much doubt . There is a fundamental unfairness in the bargain by which the voluntary ( chiefly Church of England ) schools offer their buildings as an equivalent for support from the taxpayers , meanwhile retaining control of the schools . These buildings , though nominally private , are in large part already public property . The voluntary subscriptions by which they were built were in large part credited against the tax levy , and the Government , where it needed the school buildings , would be quite justified in expropriating them at a low valuation . As it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public pays for their maintenance , but remain private because the old managers retain a majority of the local committees , and the bill provides for respecting the sectarian " atmosphere " of each school . We doubt if the English people will long abide by so bad a bargain , and weconfidently expect to see the people put in full control of the denominational schools Meanwhile a rather bad educational measure stands as a monument to Mr. Balfour 's parliamentary tact . In rebuking German workingmen foi ' voting as Social Democrats , Emperor William necessarily assumes to know better than they do where their true political interest lies . That , of course , does not embarrass him . He frankly takes all knowledge for his province . Yet even his easy air of infallible wisdom does not go well with the fact that the party which he denounces for its complete folly has a larger voting strength than any other political group in Germany . The steady rise of the Social Democratic vote , in the successive elections to the Reichstag , has been the most significant phenomenon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the party will show itself still stronger numerically at the election next June , despite the Emperor 's protests . Indeed , the present drift of legislation in Germany , with the surrender of the Government to the Agrarians , is finely calculated to make Socialist votes . Nor should it be forgotten that German Socialism , politically considered , is by no means the wholly evil thing the Kaiser would have us believe it . Thousands of Germans are in the Social Democratic ranks simply because they think they can there more effectively register their dissent from Sheer absolutism in government .
