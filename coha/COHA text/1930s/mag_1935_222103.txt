Of all the Senators who sat in the last session of Congress the one least liked by his colleagues was undoubtedly the late Huey Long . Had a secret vote for that distinction been taken , a runner-up to the Louisiana " Kingfish " would probably have been blind Senator Thomas David Schall of Minnesota . He was so unmeasured in his attacks on President Roosevelt , his wife and family , that even the sternest opponents of the New Deal shivered . But just as Senators were shocked by the assassination of Democrat Huey Long , so last week they were shocked by the tragedy that befell Republican Tom Schall . <P> Driving one evening from his office in the Capitol to his home at Berwyn Heights , Md. , he recollected that he had an errand at a grocery store .

Not until 1914 , however , did he enter politics , a career in which blindness was to prove an asset rather than a liability . For ten years he sat in the House . Minnesota elected him to the Senate in 1924 . <P> In spite of his blindness . Senator Schall used to ride horseback frequently in Washington 's suburbs , used to cross Washington streets freely with a trained police dog as guide . Last week , unaccompanied by horse or hound , he trusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
