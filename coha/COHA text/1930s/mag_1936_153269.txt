Rounding out the second month of its methodical exploratory tour of the U. S. investment trust business ordered by Congress , the Securities &; Exchange Commission figuratively arrived last week in Boston . In so doing , it unearthed not one whiff of scandal , received for a change an instructive lesson in safe money management . <P> Trusts in all their variations are woven into the whole fabric of Boston life . A Bostonian who is not either a beneficiary or trustee of at least one personal trust fund is liable to find himself at a distinct social disadvantage . Boston is the home of the oldest investment trust in the U. S.-Boston Personal Property Trust , founded in 1893 . Boston is also the home of the open-end or mutual general management trust , which is usually called the " Boston-type trust . " * <P> Boston-type trusts are 1 ) always in the process of selling more stock to the public and 2 ) always willing to buy back their stock at approximately its liquidating value . Thus they have the " open-end " feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their own unique feature , redeemable shares . Last week at hearings in Washington , SEC inspected the oldest ( 1924 ) , biggest ( $110,000,000 ) Boston-type trust in the U. S. - Massachusetts Investors Trust . <P> Most important factor in M.I.T. 's existence is a concern which has the exclusive right to sell its stock . Directly and through dealers Massachusetts Distributors , Inc. last year sold $38,000,000 worth of M.I.T. shares . The trust receives an amount equal to the liquidating value of its shares already outstanding on the day new shares are sold , so that there is no dilution of equity . For its commission the selling company adds about 5% ( reduced from 8% ) . On repurchases from stockholders who want to sell the trust pays the full liquidating value , though it has the right to offer 1% less . Last year it had to repurchase only $700,000 worth of its shares . <P> Active head of M.I.T. is Merrill Griswold , a 50-year-old Boston lawyer who married a Lowell . There are two other trustees and a five-man advisory board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's list is Charles Francis Adams , **26;7317;TOOLONG of the second President of the U. S .. Herbert Hoover 's Secretary of the Navy and reputedly the richest member of his ancient family . Another is Roger Amory. the philosophical president of Consolidated Investment Trust . He lists his hobbies as books , walks and lying in the sun . wrote for his 25th Harvard Class ( 1910 ) Book : " I believe in the consanguinity and spiritual relationship of potentate and mollusk and in the infiniteness of the universe and the inflexibility of natural law . ' ' <P> An M.I.T. adviser who believes in the inflexibility of economic law is Oliver Mitchell Wentworth Sprague , the Harvard seer who quit his advisory job in the Treasury in a huff over New Deal monetary policy . Last week in Washington Mr. ' Sprague held forth upon investment policy for the benefit of SEC . Pointing out that M.I.T. was deeply concerned with steady income . he observed that if appreciation were the chief object , a trust should be a one-man affair .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
