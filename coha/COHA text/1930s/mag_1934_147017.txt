Last week a rich old man died in what the Press called his " palatial home " near Los Angeles . His age was assumed to be 92 years . His importance could be gauged by the fact that before his funeral the Federal Government in Washington dispatched a telegram forbidding burial without its consent . <P> About the time John Tyler was President of the U. S. , the Creeks were looking with awe and reverence on a child that had been born among them near Fort Sill . Like most primitive peoples they regarded half-wits as inspired . Nearly fifty years passed and the inspired child grew to middle age . In Grover Cleveland 's time he was making 75 a day as a farm hand near Henryetta , Okla. , living in a miserable shack , dressing in dirty blankets . The people of Henryetta knew him as Crazy Jack but on the Government 's records he was set down as Jackson Barnett . <P> In Benjamin Harrison 's time the Department of Interior began to allot farms to the members of the Five Civilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , went 160 acres in eastern Oklahoma which he did not bother to go and look at . In 1912 after Crazy Jack had lived peaceably through the administrations of 18 Presidents , something happened to him . A man came , gave him $800 , got him to put his thumb print on a paper granting the right to drill for oil on his farm for which he was to receive a royalty of one-eighth of all oil produced . The great Gushing Oil Pool had been discovered adjoining his land . <P> From that time on Crazy Jack began to visit law courts . He was not worried by litigation . In fact he often fell asleep on the benches in courtrooms . A rival oilman had his first lease cancelled in court and Crazy Jack declared incompetent . A local businessman was appointed his guardian . Soon his farm was producing 12,000 bbl. of oil a day and his income had reached $60,000 a month . <P> Other oil-rich Indians squandered their money on grand pianos and limousines . But Jackson Barnett continued living on $50 a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land and untold sharpers tried to victimize him but he understood too little to fall for their blandishments . During the War his guardian invested $1,400,000 of his money in Liberty Bonds . By 1920 he was worth probably $4,000,000 . The Commissioner of Indian Affairs let him give $25,000 each to seven local churches . $400,000 for missionary work and $1,000,000 to found an Indian hospital . <P> Adventure came to him in the person of Anna Laura Lowe , a white widow woman . A court decision described what followed : " Barnett was kidnapped by an adventuress . " All through one night they rode in a taxi to Coffeyville , Kans. where they were married . Then they crossed the State line to Missouri and were married again . <P> In 1923 Jackson Barnett and his wife went to Washington . His wife 's lawyer was a smart young Kansan named Harold McGugin . The Secretary of the Interior , Albert Bacon Fall , obligingly agreed to let Jackson Barnett give half a million dollars in Liberty Bonds to the Baptist Home Mission Society and another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $135,000 was alleged to have gone to Lawyer McGugin.
