In all his 81 years Samuel Finley Breese Morse never attended a National Inventors ' Congress . Neither did Alexander Graham Bell , nor Thomas Alva Edison , nor Charles Proteus Steinmetz . Nevertheless hundreds of lesser inventors , any one of whom might become a Morse , a Bell or an Edison overnight , were assembled in Hollywood last week for the National Inventors ' Congress . These were not the bigwigs of industrial and academic laboratories . They were the humble rank &; file of U. S. idea men , indefatigable purveyors of small ingenuities , perpetual optimists who swell the total of U. S. patents to some 50,000 a year . For example , Albert Giese of Benton Harbor , Mich. , had heard a shocking story that 15,000 to 20,000 milkers are blinded every year by the restless tails of cows . His patented cow-tail restrainer was on display last week among 484 other inventions . <P> Having pondered the fact that many a criminal knows how to slip out of handcuffs , A. C. Elliott of Denver , onetime Royal Mounted policeman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adrian was happy to demonstrate . <P> Another inventor observed that people wiping their feet on doormats all wipe with a rearward motion , which gradually flattens the bristles and decreases the efficacy of the mat . Some callers are too lazy to wipe their feet at all . Both problems are taken care of by his revolving doormat which gives the feet a circular scouring while the visitor stands still . <P> E. Carlstrom of Chicago contributed a tear-gas gun which a woman may conceal beneath her skirt , ready for use at the approach of a molester . Miss Catherine A. Moran pulled up her dress to show how it was used . <P> An item of interest to flag-carriers in parades was a flagstaff , which may be telescoped when the flag-carrier passes under a low bridge . <P> H. C. Lavery of Minneapolis contributed a " psychograph , " a hemispherical metal framework which is fitted over the head . The head displaces a number of levers inside , and from the changed setting of the levers a character analysis can be read off . <P> Alfred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuned three musical steps higher than an ordinary violinand and which he says reproduces the " celestial " or " seraphic " tones of ancient instruments . He calls it a " violaeol , " a word made up from violin and aeolian . Miss Violet Sheldon was interested . <P> Also to be seen : a clock with a million possible settings for the alarm ; an automatic chewing gum vendor in which a miniature bronco kicks out the gum ; an iron mask to supplant hot towels in facial massages ; a gadget for looping up trouser-legs to resemble knickerbockers ; a powder-puff for removing neck wrinkles and double chins ; a mechanical backscratcher . <P> Albert G. Burns of Oakland , Calif , was re-elected president of the Congress . It was Mr. Burns who last year revealed that a Clevelander named Antonio Longoria had invented a death-ray which killed rabbits , dogs &; cats instantly ( TIME , July 23 ) . President Burns said that Inventor Longoria would withhold his secret until invasion threatened the U. S.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
