Tone , Not Nourishment <P> Sirs : TIME exaggerates the digestive ability of hogs . On April 6 you state that " pigs eat coal with relish , digest it with ease . " This idea was rooted in a statement in my Next Hundred Years- ' ' Hogs eat coal and enjoy it " ( TIME , June 1 ) . Hogs undoubtedly eat coal . Many a mid-western porker sees the black lumps of bituminous coal constantly before him supplied by his indulgent master . If munching effectively and with gusto is a mark of enjoyment , then the pigs actually enjoy this unusual foodstuff , apparently considerably more than the average American enjoys his daily slabs of charred bread at breakfast . I wish to point out , however , that enjoyment and digestion are not synonymous . In the case of the hog the coal passes through well pulverized , but it is doubtful if he digests it , for probably no noteworthy chemical changes take place in the process .

" I am able to supply the information on the highest authority , namely , Fred Fletcher , tenant on my farm here . On the return of myself and wife from a winter 's cruise in Illinois , I proceeded to empty the ashes in my furnace which Fred had attended to during our absence . I was puzzled to see no fresh ashes on the dump or any evidence of ashes except that the coal ( anthracite ) bin was nearly empty . " Ca n't I have those ashes ? " asked Fred . " Sure , but what do you want them for ? " I countered . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fred . " Go way back and sit down , " I remarked testily . " Come and see , " said Fred . He took a basketful of ashes and cinders and gave them to the porkers who ate them ravenously . That galoot Fred had been wintering his hogs with my ashes , and they appeared to thrive on them .
