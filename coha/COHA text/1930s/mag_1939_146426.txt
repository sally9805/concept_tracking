As one of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain 's more steadfast opponents , Conservative Winston Churchill has long been the cat that walked by himself when he was not clawing the Government for its haste to appease and its tardiness to arm . Like the sly puss in Kipling 's Just So Stories , he has had to sit beyond the cozy Government hearth , destined never to warm a Cabinet corner unless somebody spoke him a kind word . Presumably because Winston Churchill is not only the Conservative Party 's best brain but its most unpredictable personality , safe &; sane Conservatives withheld their kind words until last week . Sly Puss Winston Churchill purred gratefully when he heard them . <P> Purred he at a dinner given for appeasing Foreign Secretary Viscount Halifax by London 's ultra-Tory 1900 Club : Lord Halifax " is an Englishman , a fox hunter and a friend . " For the Government 's present policies he now wanted nothing so much as " a united Party , a united Nation and a united Empire . " He even did a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British nation , " said he , " would support for a moment designs against the peace and safety of the Reich and its legitimate prospects of growth and expansion . " <P> Purred back appeased Appeaser Lord Londonderry , longtime friend of Nazi Foreign Minister von Ribbentrop : " I wish Mr. Churchill were a member of the Government this moment . " With a scrape heard round the world the Conservatives thus made Puss Churchill a path to a place by the fire , and politicos with second sight could already see Winston Churchill snuggled into a reorganized Chamberlain Cabinet , probably as First Lord of the Admiralty , the post he filled brilliantly during the World War . In any case , with this great reconciliation a united Conservative Party could brave not only the perils of German aggression , but the prospects of a general election in the fall . <P> Sampled recently by the British Institute of Public Opinion , the British public also spoke kind words ; 56% wanted Winston Churchill in the Chamberlain Government ; 26% did not ; 18% did not say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
