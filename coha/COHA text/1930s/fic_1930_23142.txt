MASTER BUILDER A STORY BY LEE FOSTER HARTMAN ? M RS . SADLER , with tear- dimmed eyes , looked out upon a melancholy landscape , as the special train , bearing the body of her husband , made its way westward Jerome Sadler , ripe in years and achievements , was dead . Across the continent the newspapers of the nation carried the announcement in black headlines , while the telegraph wires were laden with the picturesque story of his career . Prospector , miner , railroad-builder , financial magnate : it was a typical chronicle of American super-achievement , from penury to multi-millions ; and a new-world empire lay witness to it . Through a vast sector of the continent , once a stubborn , unclaimed wilderness , Jerome Sadler had thrust the thin wedge of his railroad by sheer , grim persistence . Forests had been felled , rivers spanned , mountains pierced . And in time the prairie had blossomed into wheat farms , towns had sprung up , and the smoke of industrial centers now blackened the once empty skies . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he had built well . It was through this vast domain , over the straight , shining rails of steel which he had laid himself , that the special train now bore his body westward to the once lowly town of his humble origin . Sadler-vine it had been renamed long ago . In the center of a green open square , fronted by tall office buildings , including one of the Sadler banks , was a massive bronze statue of the master builder who had brought prosperity and fame to the place wanly out at a familiar landscape . She knew every mile of that long journey , visioning it from a retrospect of many years : the broad fields and rich farms , the thriving , prosperous towns , the striving industrial centers that seemed to thrust up chimneys almost overnight . At every turn the past merged with the present and with the portentous future , testifying to Sadler 's vision , courage , and enduring strength . Each stage of that forlorn processional had its reminder of him ; each familiar landmark brought its pang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were mere outposts of civilization , struggling to establish themselves in a vast alien wilderness . She remembered how year by year the flat brown prairie land had yielded before the advance of the wheat 's billowing green , and the little homesteads had begun to dot bravely the unbroken plain . And she remembered her husband 's glowing pride in it all as the years mounted and they watched the culmination of the miracle he had wrought . Now she seemed to be making the journey utterly alone , for the children and the grandchildren around her hardly seemed to count ; and never had the trip " home " seemed so slow and so long . It was taxing the last of her ebbing strength . At every station where the train drew in for a brief halt , she could see gathered a curious but hushed crowd with uncovered heads . There would be brisk , important looking persons wearing white badges labelled " Committee . " She could see the station trucks , laden with fresh floral offerings , wheeled slowly forward to add their tribute to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Commerce or the Municipal Council , conspicuously silk-hatted and dressed in black , bore resolutions of sympathy tied with purple ribbon , which would eventually be brought to her private compartment and placed in her hands . At each new testimonial of this sort , her tears would start again . And then the train , with a long shuddering jerk , would lurch forward , andthe slow processional resume its course . Her grandson , Paul , was an excited and highly interested participant in this unprecedented adventure . He had been garbed in a new suit of black , with a jaunty black sailor tie at his throat . He had been told , and was aware in his childish way , that grandpa was dead ; but the novelty of this strange journey , the throngs at the railroad stations , checked any stirring of grief . He was never quiet for an instant on this extraordinary train , where he was free to roam wherever he liked . He had penetrated into the Pullman in the rear , where he had fraternized with the newspaper men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousin Barbara , two years his junior , he had explored the mysteries of the buffet kitchen , and now he was back in the " Sunnyside " again , invading Mrs. Sadler 's compartment . " When do we get to Sadlerville , grandma ? " " Not till this evening , " the little white-haired woman answered in an empty , tired voice . " Will there be a brass band at the station ? " " I do n't know , dear . Why do n't you go and play with Barbara ? " The boy ignored the question . His nose was pressed against the car window as some passing object drew his attention . " What 's your father doing ? " she asked at length . " Playing bridge with Uncle Bert and Aunt Daisy and Aunt Genevieve . " Mrs. Sadler 's eyes closed sharply as if at some sudden hurt . " I wish they would n't  --  not now ! " And then after a silence she added , " Go and ask your father to come here , please . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Will they be selling black balloons instead of red ones at the station ? " " What on earth do you mean ? " " Mr. Sparks said they would . He 's one of the reporters in the back car . " " He was only fooling you , dear . " Just then a tall , hard-faced man of forty , Lynch Sadler , her eldest son , entered the compartment . He frowned at the boy , and said , in curt , parental tones , " Get out of here , and stop annoying your grandmother . " The boy went . " Lynch , I wish you would n't play cards . It do n't seem right -- - " Mrs. Sadler 's voice broke , and the black-bordered handkerchief went to her eyes . Lynch Sadler frowned and looked down uncomfortably at his cigarette . " It 's a deuce of a long trip , mother , " he said lamely . " Got to do something to kill time . " " But think of your father . . . in the baggage car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , it was n't me that got up the game . Daisy and Bert were crazy to play , so I said I 'd sit in . " " And you 're playing for money ? " " You 'd hardly call ten cents a point money , " he defended . " Good Lord , mother , you ca n't play for nothing . " Mrs. Sadler leaned back with a heavy sigh . As usual the children had their way , as they had always had it . " I wish you would n't , " she pleaded weakly , gazing out of the car window . Lynch said nothing . The hand , in which he was dummy , would be about finished , he reflected , and the next deal was his . He rose slowly to his feet , and cast a vague look around . " You all right in here by yourself ? Got everything you want ? " Mrs. Sadler nodded absently without replying , and Lynch left . For a while her old misgiving about the children troubled her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , all except the youngest , Jerome , Jr. , who was in college . Their six successive births and their early rearing had spanned the stretch of years when her husband was in the thick of his superhuman achievement which had absorbed all his energies . He had hardly been aware of the increasing familygrowing up around him All his time and thought were so inexorably demanded elsewhere . But the children had been looked after  --  the tide of wealth that had begun to mount had made that an easy task to delegate to other hands ; and Jerome Sadler had that genius beyond all other men of knowing where his personal attention was vitally demanded and what he could safely leave to subordinates . Bert Sadler , one year younger than his brother Lynch and in many respects a replica of him , glanced idly out the car window while Lynch swiftly dealt the cards for a new hand . Suddenly his face darkened with annoyance . " We 're coming to another town , and it 's a big one , " he announced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee to this next bunch of plug hats . How about Raymond taking a turn at representing the family ? Where 's he keeping himself ? " At this mention of the wastrel of the Sadler clan , Lynch merely shrugged his shoulders . He had not spoken to his brother Raymond in five years , following a violent quarrel with him , and only their father 's death had compelled their presence together on the same train , where they kept aloof from each other in a sort of cold truce . " He 's treating the reporters to drinks in the rear car , " said Lynch indifferently . " The conductor tells me there 's quite a spree going on back there . " " Trust Raymond to improve a chance like this , " grumbled Bert . " I think it 's disgusting ! " said Daisy , who was Bert 's wife . The fact that she was not a Sadler born but came of a New England family that had acquired affluence and social position before the War of 1811 was a fact that Genevieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget , and which she felt sometimes tinged Daisy 's sardonic comment in a family discussion . Now Genevieve bridled . " I never see you passing up a sixth MASTER cocktail if the shaker holds out , " she said tartly , gathering up her cards and sorting them with a hawklike eagerness . She was all for the rigor of the game . " Did you pass , Lynch ? I bid three spades . " Daisy regarded her sister-in-Iaw with a supercilious smile . " So sweet of you , Genevieve , to bring up my failings . " She studied her cards vindictively . " Four hearts ! " she announced . " Double , " said Bert . Lynch frowned . As he debated over his hand , the train began to slacken speed and the wheels of the ear jolted over switches . Grimy warehouses and factories swept past . " Pull down the window-shades , somebody . We do n't want a lot of rubes staring in at us . " Daisy snickered . She secretly disliked Lynch , who as eldest son took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His concern for the proprieties of the occasion now stirred her cynical mirth . " Do it yourself , Lynch , " she retorted . " You 're the head of the house now and guardian of its reputation . " " Pass four hearts , doubled , " Genevieve cut in on Daisy 's comment . " Try and make it ! " She gathered her cards defiantly together , hoping for a slaughter , and glared at Daisy . " Yes , darling , " said Daisy sweetly . In the rear Pullman , where a haze of tobacco smoke filled the air , Raymond Sadler held the center of the stage among a group of newspaper men . Raymond was only thirty-two , but his hair had already taken on a tinge of gray above the ears ; a weak , ingratiating smile lighted up his face , which looked a little sodden and pallid . Born almost a decade later than his brothers Lynch and Bert , when the Sadler fortune was mounting to considerable proportions , he had not shared the rigors of their earliest boyhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been softened by indulgence . He had spent four desultory but expensive years at Harvard , where he had developed a taste for clothes and sports . A trail of squandered gold had marked his later progress through Paris , San Remo , and Vienna . He had acquired the minor vices of Europe , as well as a blas ? , manof-the-world air . For his native West he had come to have nothing but a bored contempt , as well as for his older brothers Lynch and Bert , since they could not comprehend how anyone should care to live east of Chicago or pursue anything else than a money-making career . " I never did understand what fun the old man got out of this God-forsaken country aside from the easy money to be made out of it , " he confided to the group around him . His protuberant and slightly bloodshot eyes regarded the drab landscape with infinite boredom while his half-filled glass hung limply in his hand . " It 's nothing but a boosters ' paradise , overgrown mushroom towns , choked with Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yapping at every corner about its being ' God 's own country . ' As if the poor saps knew anything about God 's taste in real estate , or had ever seen a civilized part of the globe . I 'd as soon live in China . Or in the Balkans , where men are men without making such a noise about it . " " You 've said it , " Sparks warmly agreed . He was ready to agree with any pronouncement made by a man about to inherit millions of dollars . Besides , he and the other reporters were aglow with Raymond 's superb Scotch whisky , which the latter dispensed with a lavish hand . " What time is it ? " their host inquired . Half a dozen watches were outthrust on sycophantic wrists . " Half-past four , Mr. Sadler . " " This must be Centralia we 're pulling into now , " added Sparks . " Let 's have another drink , " said Raymond . " And porter , " he called to the Pullman attendant , " see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the next stop , while the town boys are up in front doing their stuff . Damned if I like this club soda . " Hilda Sadler , Lynch 's tall , angular , and somewhat formidable wife , was sitting in a secluded corner of the " Royalton . " At length she tossed aside a translation of Andre Gide 's Les FauxMannayeurs , in which she had vainly tried to become interested . It was a stupid story , and she could make nothing of it . She wished that she had a novel as good as The Sheik , which she still remembered fondly , or better still , some motion-picture magazines filled with rotogravure pictures . But she had neglected to provide herself and had to make the best of what reading matter Phyllis Sadler had brought with her . She could n't understand Phyllis 's taste in books , nor did she , in fact , understand Phyllis . She did not know her very well . Phyllis was twenty-five  --  with the exception of Jerome , Jr. , the youngest of the Sadler children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to an aloof and independent existence . Inheriting something of her father 's stubborn resolution , she had contrived to detach herself from the family circle , and she now lived most of the time in Paris , where she painted fitfully in the ateliers and spent her life in other ways wholly mysterious to the Sadler clan . Hilda yawned , covered her mouth with her hand , and then inspected her carefully manicured nails . Her fingers were heavily ringed with unpleasantly large and expensive stones , which Lynch had given her . He liked her to " dress the part , " as he termed it , and she , too , felt that she would not be living up to her role as the wife of Jerome Sadler 's eldest son if she did not display upon her person conspicuous evidence and reminder of the Sadler millions . She took from her bag a small mirror and inspected her face and hair . She was far from beautiful , but she considered that she had a " good " face , andshe was always pridefully aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state of the wave in her hair and wondered if there might not be a decent beauty parlor established in Sadlerville since her last reluctant visit there . After the burial of Lynch 's father , she reflected with relief , she would never again have to make this long and tedious journey . She fell to thinking again about Jerome Sadler 's will and speculating as to the distribution of the estate among the six children . She was desperately eager that Lynch , as the eldest son , should receive the lion 's share . She would not be happy unless his portion overtopped very measurably that which would fall to Bert and Daisy . Unfortunately , Bert was only a year or so younger than Lynch , and old Jerome Sadler had always treated his two oldest sons very much alike . She suspected that Stanley Price , his confidential secretary , knew more about the terms of the will than he would admit , but she had never been able to pry or wheedle any definite information out of him . Where was Stanley , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Phyllis . A smoldering jealousy broke again into flame . Stanley Price , it was becoming more and more evident to her sharp observation , was slipping out of her grasp . Although several years his senior , she loved him secretly with a desperate intensity which she had never felt toward Lynch . But since Phyllis 's latest return from Paris she had detected signs of a change in his attitude . She would have to have it out with Stanley , she reflected , her lips tightening to a hard line . Thank Heaven , Phyllis was n't interested in a man like Stanley , or in any man for that matter . Jerome , Jr. , wandering aimlessly through the train , at a loss for amusement or occupation , halted to watch the card game . He did not care for bridge , which he felt was too intellectual to be a pastime . He stood at Lynch 's elbow , indifferently observant of his older brother 's cool , dexterous play . It was the rubber game , and the spirited bidding had carried Lynch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A grim tension filled the silence . A card accidentally slipped from Bert 's hand , which he hurriedly caught up . " Exposed card ! " said Lynch sternly . " Put it down . " Bert laid on the table the nine of spades . Lynch studied a moment . The ace , king , and ten of spades were in the dummy hand ; he himself held three to the knave . He led a spade from his own hand , Genevieve on his left played one of the three low spades she held , and Lynch drew the ten from dummy . " Play the nine , " he commanded his brother , who held the queen . Genevieve instantly divined that by this maneuver the doubled contract would be made and the rubber won . She flung her cards down on the table and turned furiously upon her brother . " You 're a dirty , low-down sneak , Lynch Sadler ! " she assailed him in a voice tense with rage . " So help me God , if I ever play with you again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth ! " said Lynch angrily . " Are we playing the rules , or are n't we ? " he demanded . " Rules  --  rubbish ! If you make Bert play the nine , I 'm through . And what 's more , you can wait till hell freezes over before I settle for this rubber ! " " So you 're a welcher , are you ? " sneered Lynch . " I wonder how much of this Mother Sadler can hear in her stateroom , " interposed Daisy in her maddening , mock-sweet tones . " Shut up , all of you , " said Bert morosely . " This is getting to be one hell of a trip , and I tell you right now that when we start back to Chicago Daisy and I are going to take a train by ourselves . " " Suits me , " said Lynch . Jerome , Jr. , wandered off from the card-table . Being cooped up on a train in this fashion , without companions of his own age and kind , made him glum and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the very thick of the October football activities because of his father 's death , and he gloomed over his hard luck in not being able to play in the game with Northwestern on Saturday . He had brought some text-hooks along , for he was seriously behind in his classes , but he had not opened them . When his sister Genevieve said to him sharply , " Why do n't you go and sit with mother for a while ? " he had listlessly obeyed , chiefly because he did not know what else to do with himself . " Hello , mother , " he said awkwardly in his big , booming voice , as he looked in at the apartment where she kept her lonely vigil by the car window . Mrs. Sadler regarded her youngest son . Everything about the nineteen-year-old youth was large , heavy , ponderous . " What were Lynch and Genevieve quarreling about ? " Jerome , Jr. , shrugged his broad shoulders and looked down at his white-andblack , wing-tipped shoes . " Oh , nothing , " he answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll say they have ! " ? the youth grinned broadly . There fell a silence . Jerome , Jr. , yawned , took a gold-mounted fountain pen out of his pocket and aimlessly inspected it . " Say , mother , " he began at length , in a wheedling , querulous tone . " What is it ? " " Ca n't I have an airplane when I go back to the university ? A lot of the fellows have them , and there ai n't any of them as rich as we are . " " Why do you bring that up again ? " his mother pleaded in a choked , unhappy voice . " You know your poor father absolutely put his foot down on it . If he were alive to-day ? " Mrs. Sadler 's words broke off , and she began to cry . The youth frowned uncomfortably at the floor . " But mother , there really is n't any danger ? " Mrs. Sadler , weeping softly into her handkerchief , was no longer listening . Presently Jerome , Jr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was always getting a tough break , lie told himself . The other fellows had airplanes . Well , he was going to have one himself , and he thought he knew how privately he could get it . And once secured , he would like to see anybody take it away from him . His sister-in-law Hilda would have to come across with the money . Not that Hilda was likely to hand over five thousand dollars of her own free will . She was the tightest one in the family . But Jerome , Jr. , calculated that when he told her what he happened to know about her and Stanley Price , she would consider his silence a good investment . And this trip seemed as good a time as any to have it out with her . Night at last had fallen , and the train pursued its way through a black , obliterated land . Sadlerville would be reached in the course of a couple of hours . The imminence of that arrival had begun to weigh upon the thoughts of the Sadler heirs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've persuaded her to lie down and take a nap , " said Phyllis , returning to the dinner table set in the " Royalton , " where the family still lingered over coffee . The grandchildren , Paul and Barbara , had been convoyed away by Hilda 's maid . The last of the dinner dishes had been removed by the negro steward , who brought ash-trays to the table . Then he had discreetly vanished . Raymond , lounging at one end of the table , produced a silver flask from his pocket and poured some of its contents into his half empty water-glass . " Give us a drink , Ray , " said Bert . " Help yourself , but the flask does n't go farther . " Lynch , who sat just beyond Bert , flushed darkly , but he ignored the remark just as he continued stubbornly to ignore the existence of his brother Raymond at the other end of the table . He turned to Hilda . " Want a drink , old girl ? Have the steward bring that bottle in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might pep you up . " " Thanks , I will , " Phyllis promptly accepted . " One needs it after a dinner like this . " " What 's the matter with you ? " tartly demanded Genevieve , regarding with cold asperity the chic Paris frock which her younger sister was wearing . She could never buy anything like that in Chicago . She resented in a way the comfortable independence that Phyllis had gained for herself by taking her life into her own hands and living it abroad . Instead , she had chosen to marry Robert Griscom , and while Robert was capable , kind , and attentive to her , she felt that her status in the family had become somehow subordinate . Robert , not being a Sadler , was quite overshadowed by Lynch and Bert . Dinner had been a dull , lugubrious affair , for the quarrel between Lynch and Genevieve over the card game still hung oppressively in the air . Now and then some question was raised regarding the arrival at Sadlerville and the arrangements for their reception at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ceremonial part under the public gaze . " Phyllis does n't like us , " said Raymond maliciously , catching up Gene-. vieve 's remark . He was sipping his glass in comfort , and quite willing to precipitate a battle of words between Genevieve and Phyllis , always at odds with each other because of a deep , inveterate antipathy . Phyllis had a spunky temper despite her schooling in old-world graces , and Raymond , who liked her because she was something of a renegade in the family , Iike himself , knew that she could more than hold her own against the entire Sadler field . Now he egged her on . " Phyllis thinks we 're a rum hunch . " " Well , are n't we ? " said Phyllis , quite matter of fact . " What do you mean ? " Lynch broke in heavily from the head of the table . " Leave yourself out if you like . But the rest of us are one hundred per cent Sadlers . Say , listen . The money represented around this table could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a newspaper in the country to-night that has n't got columns about Jerome Sadler and us . Jerome Sadler , Master Builder of the West . We are his descendants and heirs . " Phyllis met this with a short , scornful laugh . " Little masterpieces . Just look at us . " " Well , what 's the matter with us ? " Bert stolidly demanded . " Everything ! " retorted Phyllis , " if you had eyes in your head . We 're just a common , nondescript , mediocre lot , without a shred of distinction of any sort . All we 've got is money . As biological specimens we could n't take third prize at a cat show . We should n't even be entered . We 're rolling in wealth simply because we were lucky enough to be born in a land that ca n't help but exude wealth upon any Tom , Dick , or Harry equipped with enough low-grade horse-sense to squeeze the juice out of an orange that is ready to burst . Father , bless him , was better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's why we 're sitting on top of the heap . " " You be careful how you talk about father , " muttered Lynch . " Do n't worry . I 've got more real respect for father than you have . Not being blinded by all the wealth he piled up for us , I can see where he succeeded and where he failed ? " " Failed ! Get that ! " scoffed Bert . " I can see where his real efforts were expended and where they were n't , " Phyllis went on , ignoring the interruption . " And that 's why to-day Sadler railroad stock amounts to something , and the Sadler live stock does n't . " Bert eyed her balefully . " You 're one of these stuck-up , expatriated Americans , full of foreign notions , that ought to be run out and kept out of the country . " " Thank you , Bert . If you could be run out of this country long enough to get a few foreign notions , as you call them , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than you are now . You 're all just a small-town , provincial , middle-class lot , smug and self-satisfied , and you 'll never rise above it , because you do n't dream that anything better exists . The whole bunch of you have come to think that the sun rises in Chicago and sets in Sadlerville , and that this railroad in between is the backbone of the universe . " " This is getting rather tiresome , if you do n't mind , " interrupted Hilda , with an attempt at hauteur . Phyllis quashed her cigarette and rose from the table . " Oh , I 've finished , " she said blandly . " Atta girl ! " cheered Raymond as she departed . One by one the family drifted away from the table . The conductor came in with a telegram regarding some last-minute changes in the arrangements at Sadlerville . " Give it to Mr. Price , " Lynch directed . " He 's looking after all those matters . " Daisy returned to counsel Bert . " Somebody ought to keep an eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family when we arrive . " " I want to have a talk with Lynch , " answered her husband . " About the estate . Go and get Genevieve . " Lynch shrugged his shoulders at this suggestion . " I tell you what you do , Daisy . Go and tell Price he 's got to see that Raymond stays sober . " As she departed , Lynch turned to his brother . " One thing I want to say right at the start , Bert , " ? he paused significantly ?
