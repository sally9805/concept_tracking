txt Mayor O'Brien vetoed the two city bills taxing stock shares and the gross income of security dealers at $:35 o'clock last night , thus preventing the removal to Newark of the Stock Exchange trading . . , ... Earlier hi the day the Mayor had been advised by Richard Whitney , president of the Stock Exchange , that the trading group would remain here if the proposed taxes were abandoned . The governing committee of the- New York and New Jersey Stock Exchanges " Bore out Mr. Whitney 's statement later by adopting formal resolutions . Helpless , O'Brien Admits . The Mayor issued a long memorandum explaining why he vetoed the two measures , which were expected to provide $10,000,000 in new revenue for unemployment relief . Although he did not refer to the Exchange 's plan to move to New I Jersey as a bluff , he said that no one had taken that possibility seriously when it was first advanced . He confessed that he was facing a situation beyond his control and he had no suggestion on where the $10,000,000 in new income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor virtually halves the $24,700 , - 000 revenue program worked out by Samuel Untermyer as financial adviser to the city . Mr. Untermyer had recommended that the stock and brokerage taxes be dropped in a statement made to the Mayor last Monday . Mr. Untermyer based his recommendation on the fact that if the Exchange moved the State would lose between $30,000,000 and $50,000,000 in revenue it now derives from the stock transfer tax of 4 cents a share . Mr. Untermyer advanced no plan to make up the missing $10,000,000 . The Mayor 's action bears directly on the city 's position with relation to its bankers . The bankers have failed to give any assurance that the city will get the $74,000,000 loan for which it has applied . The city needs $25,000,000 by Friday to meet its current expenses and the Oct. 1 payrolls , but the bankers have made no move toward advancing that money . Contractors ' Pay Held Up . The flow of warrants authorizing contract payments by the city has stopped entirely for the last week or ten days . Contractors have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used for current expenses : The Finance Department had taken this course on previous occasions to conserve all the cash the city received to meet payrolls . The present income , however , is not nearly sufficient to meet this end . The city 's program for new revenues was originally designed to provide a basis on which the bankers could make additional loans . With the security represented in the new income , both Mr. Untermyer and the Mayor believed the city would have no difficulty in obtaining funds . Abandoning the stock taxes , however , has impaired this security and has consequently decreased the city 's chances of obtaining new loans . The action revived talk of a possible default on payroll and interest payments on Oct. 1 . If the bankers hold their present position , the default is unavoidable , since the city exhausted its cash resources in meeting the last payroll on Sept. 15 . Mayor O'Brien returned to City Hall at 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon from a conference of Brooklyn Democratic leaders . At that time he said he did not know what action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock he said he intended to veto both measures . He did not actually disapprove them , however , until 8:35 , when he gave out a statement explaining the action . Statement of O'Brien . His formal statement follows : Before the adoption of these measures by the Municipal . Assembly , I gave the subject of the proiinsed taxes involved herein , and other taxes adopted at the same time , a great deal of serious thought . Indeed , it should be recorded herein that during the past eight months the whole subject of producing new sources of revenue to meet the ever increasing burden of unemployment and home relief has been the most pressing problem before us . Before any action was taken on any form of new taxes designed to produce revenues to care for the unemployed , I called a public meeting of the Board of Estimateand . Apportionment , and . invited the representatives of a very large number of organizations interested . in public affairs to send their representatives to the hearing for the purpose of securing a broad expression of opinion as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry on unemployment relief . The meeting was attended by over 200 representatives of various bodies , taxpayers ' organizations , community counsels , chambers of commerce , et al. , and the Mayor and the other members of the board heard discussion for e over five hours . Various other discussions have been carried on before the Board of Estimate at its meetings upon this subject and a great variety of taxes suggested . At the request of the board , a special session of the Legislature was called by Governor Lehman , to permit the ? introduction of bills designed to authorize tax measures which were calculated to produce the necessary funds for relief purposes . As a result of the special session , the local authorities were empowered to impose taxes . There followed quickly a discussion by the Board of Estimate and Apportionment of the best means of relieving our situation with regard to unemployment relief ; and as a result , four separate bills calculated to provide adequate relief funds were determined upon and the above bills were introduced as two of the four revenue measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Board of Estimate and Apportionment and by the Board of Aldermen . During and since the passage of these measures a great deal of discussion has been carried on . Numerous protests were made before the two boards at the time when the bills were . being considered . Many written protests were forwarded . to me and members of the board , through resolutions , letters and telegrams . The above measures having been passed by both branches of the Municipal Assembly and a hearing having been held before me yesterday , Sept. 25 , 1933 , where various arguments were made , these matters now come before me for action . Following the passage of the above measures , new facts and conditions have been , disclosed . These happenings and activities have presented possibilities which though previously referred to by objectants to the tax measures were never seriously considered as likely to be realized . The situation presented during the last ten days or two weeks is extreme  --  y serious . It extends in several different directions , and in its most dangerous aspect includes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State stock transfer tax , with the resulting loss to the State treasury and the derangement of its budget . The threatened . embarrassment to the City of New York in its plan embodied in the above measures to care for , during the next fifteen months , those without employment , food and shelter , also has become so serious as to demand a complete review of the whole situation . Unfortunately for the purposes of the program enacted . by the . Municipal ' Assembly in these measures , the issues now raised come at a time when other equally serious problems must be met and solved . Whatever one may think about the lack of ' cooperation and spirit of sacrifice and . the absence of local patriotism , which have been manifested in connection - with the adoption of these measures , this is not just the time to discuss such subjects . I am confronted with a situation which I cannet control , wherein serious and pressing conclusions must be made . Thus , I reach my decision without any reservation , which is to veto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not be construed as a change of mind with respect to the original necessity of passing the above measures and the inescapable obligation upon me and the other members of the Board of Estimate and Apportionment of finding , wherever we may , the means of carrying on relief work in this city and caring for all needy and dependent persons . Fate of Other Levies in Doubt . The Mayor added that he had not made up his mind what to do with two other measures providing for new taxes on savings banks , public utilities and life insurance companies . Both these measures have encountered bitter and powerful opposition . While the Mayor did not intimate what he would do with them , his statement said that the present situation called for a complete review of the entire situation . The demands for relief financing over the next fifteen months are increasing steadily . The Welfare Council last Monday urged the city to appropriate $10,000,000 a month for relief instead of the 85,000,000 now voted . Members ' of the Board of Estimate have not considered this request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in relief payments for September . The Mayor , Mr. Untermyer and Controller George will again represent the ' city at a conference with Governor Lehman and the city 's bankers this morning . Beginning at 9:30 in the Governor 's home at 820 Park Avenue , the conference will attempt to straighten out the tangle in the city 's finances , which was made more complex by yesterday 's developments . Three previous conferences have been held , without tangible result . $25,000,000 in Notes Due . The bankers hold $25,000,000 in , short-term city securities issued to defray the cost of relief , which are already overdue . Mr. Untermyer at first said this sum would be repaid from the new taxes received by the city , but later reversed . his position and said the obligations could not be redeemed because all new revenue was needed for relief . Holding these overdue securities gives the bankers additional reason to be cool toward new city loans . As the Untermyer program for new revenue now stands , the city has provided altogether for about $33,000,000 in new taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on each taxicab ride and increasing the water rates by 50 per cent . Measures awaiting the Mayor 's signature but already passed by the Municipal Assembly place taxes on the savings banks , , insurance companies and utilities . '
