txt The American naval ' policy declaration which Chairman Vinson of the House Committee on Naval Affairs announced , on Friday , would be written into the pending $800,000,000 Naval Construction Bill is " camouflage , " the purpose of which is to " alibi a super-navy , " Representative Hamilton Fish , Republican , of New York , declared before the committee today . He charged that if President Roosevelt had the power " to pick an aggressor nation , " the United States would now be . at war , and that the proposed naval increase , if legislated into law by the Congress , would be nothing more nor less than . " a direct road to war . " Mr. Fish declared that the course of wisdom would be to call another conference for the limitation of naval armament and that if this was done the United States should enter that conference prepared to vote Japan naval parity with the United States . The proposed building program is , in fact , asserted Mr. Fish , the President 's " own program . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the program may be obeying orders . The " super-navy , ' if Congress votes in favor of it , will be used , in Mr. Fish 's opinion , to police and quarantine the world , to blockade or join in the blockade of other nations . The fact that the naval limitatior treaties are now dead and that no move is under way to restore them is the fault , said . Mr. Fish , of the Roosevelt Administration . The United States , he declared , is leading the world-wide naval construction race now under way . He indicated that he considered limitation of naval armament by treaty died when the United . States refused at the last London conference to grant parity to Japan . " 7 contend , " he continued , " that the navy we have now is more than sufficient for all purposes of national defense . I contend that this program is a ' pet measure ' of the President . It is unnecessary , unwise and inconsistent with our foreign policy of neutrality and noninterference in the affairs of other nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from foreign war and at the same time have a navy that will defend us from attack . " I challenge any admiral to testify that Japan could land 50,000 troops on our shores . I know enough about war to say that such an army would not last thirty days . " According to Mr. Fish the people of the United States " can sleep quietly " for the next twenty-five years so far as Invasion by Japan is concerned . Urges Limitation Conference " Why ca n't we give Japan equality or parity with us unless our aim is to do what I believe we are trying to do , and that is to police the world ? " Mr. Fish said . Defending the Japanese naval position , Mr. Fish said that nation had even , gone so far as to suggest the elimination of battleships and aircraft carriers on the ground that such ships are offensive rather than defensive , " but we refused to go along . " Urging Congress to legislate to bring about a limitation conference possibly within the next thirty days , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States and not of Great Britain or Japan . The policy proclaimed by Secretary Hull was also that stated by Secretary Stimson in the Hoover Administration , Mr. Fish said . If Mr. Stimson had had his way the country would have been at war during the Hoover Administration , he asserted . Both Mr. Hull and Mr. Stimson , he added , favored a policy permitting the President to declare another nation the aggressor and to proceed to punish that aggressor , whoever It might be . " This bill , " he declared , " translated into . actuality what the President said at Chicago when he advocated concerted action and the quarantine and policing of the world . " Charges " Scare " Is Created " Do n't be fooled by the press , " he exclaimed , adding that ? most of the newspapers , including THE NETT YORK TIMES , and The Baltimore Sun , advocated concerted action . This , he asserted , was a war psychology " created to scare the American people . " The only other witness today was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Iowa , a student at Union Theological Seminary , New York , who is Social-Action chairman of the National Council of Methodist Youth of the northern branch of the Methodist Episcopal Church . He said his organization has the support of the bishops of the church , and that the protest of himself and the organization he represents was made as " patriots . " The pending bill , he charged , represents an aggression move and is for the protection of " the American dollar abroad . " Members of the council , at least a very large number of them , he said , would not fight for the United States , even on home soil , if in their opinion the cause of the United States was a bad one . The witness said . that he would not defend his mother and sister in his home were invaded , " and they would not want me to , " he added . Representative Fish gave as his I opinion that men who refuse to defend their country in time of war ought to be put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
