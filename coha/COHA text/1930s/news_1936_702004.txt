txt A blistering heat wave that cut a path of death and disti ess through the Plains States and the Middle West continued to roll slowly over the Eastern seaboard for the third successive day yesterday , smothering city and town , hamlet and farm , under a hot blanket of devastation . In the cities a blazing sun beat down upon steel and concrete , crippling civic and commercial activities ; highways and bridges buckled under its merciless rays in suburban communities , and in the farming sections crops and grass were scorched . Again , as on Thursday , many long-standing weather I records were shattered . In New York the official high mark for the day was 2.3 below the record peak of 102.3 reached on Thursday , but the cumulative effects of the three-day wave brought more distress to city dwellers thin they have thus far felt .

While many factories and corporations closed down for the day when the afternoon heat became intolerable , employes in the large department stores , . with few exceptions , remained at their posts .

No prostratlons were reported , either among the department store employes or customers . In one store , which is air-conditioned on several floors , it was said customers sauntered around in the cool air rather than face the heat outside .

Van Hamel , president of the Sheffield Farms Company , and Harry A. Cronk , head of Borden 's Farm Products Company . Mr. Van Borne said that the increase in milk consumption in the metropolitan area " assures dairymen a better than normal price for their milk without increasing the price to the consumer .
