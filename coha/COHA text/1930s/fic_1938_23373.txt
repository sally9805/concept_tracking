BOATS FOR HIRE A STORY BY BUCKLIN MOON A , JOAN got out of the car the three cur dogs swirled round her legs , sniffing at her noisily , and she bent to talk them out of their distrust of her . The air was yet cool and she raised her head and let the wind wash her face fresh . Down river and across the grassy hammocks where the river joined the open sea at Mosquito Inlet , the lighthouse tower loomed huge against the early morning sky . She stood for a moment waiting for her father to take out the tackle from the back of the car . As they turned the corner of the house she saw the woman on the front stoop , standing like something carved in profile , so that her apron failed to hide her swollen body . She was wearing an old sun-bonnet and under the protruding brim her hawklike nose dwarfed the rest of her features into harshness . When she saw them her smile cracked the leathery hardness of her face . " Toby is nigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't belong to be late , but he 'll be along directly . He 's done et already and gone to git his tackle . Men you and ycr daddy wish , come rest a spell on the stoop . Toby wo n't be noways long . " Joan left her father on the bottom step of the porch and walked slowly down to the water 's edge . Behind her she could hear her father asking about the fishing and the woman 's reply came to her faintly like the drone of some insect . " Well , now , hit 's been betwixt and between . Mostly though hit 's beengood . Take the other day , reckon hit was Tuesday last , Toby had out a party and they like to caught a boatful . Now the next time hit might likely not be as good . Jest ai n't no ways of tellin . They been ketchin mostly trouts , but they 's been some bass too . Then for them as likes hit there 's sheepshead and seek A body jest do n't know what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't started running in the river yet ? " " They 's been a smatterin of blues , most ways a stragglin there and there . Seems them blues is way out yit . Ai n't been ary a school in close , leastways none 1 heered of . " Joan lost interest in what they were saying and looked out over the dark river . She picked up an oyster shell and tried to skip it across the water , but it was not flat enough and sank slowly from sight , fluttering from side to side . Behind her she heard the crunch of shells and she looked round and saw Toby bending over a rowboat which was tied to a stake driven into the sand at the edge of the water . He pushed it free from the mud and it swung clear with the movement of the incoming tide . " Hello , " she called to him , " think we 'll have any luck to-day ? " He turned toward her slowly . " Cai n't tell , " he answered tersely . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She waited for him to go on , but he turned his back to her and bent over the boat again . " Does it look like a good day ? " she asked . He straightened up and looked out over the water . " Reckon the day 's all right . " She was half angry at his curtness and unconsciously her hand smoothed the ends of her hair . " Was that stuff yonder by the stoop all the truck youall brung ? " " Yes . " " Reckon we best to git started then . You kin call your daddy . " She turned toward the house and saw her father coming down the path . Then suddenly she felt something crawl across her canvas shoe and she jumped nervously . She looked down and saw a fiddler crab sidewalking away toward the bank . " Them fiddlers wo n't hurt you none , m'am , " Toby said . " I know it , " she answered curtly . " I did n't see what it was until after 1 jumped . I felt something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a snake . " She looked at him . He was not laughing , but the look around his eyes irritated her . She started to say something more , but instead got quickly into the boat . The old outboard motor whined its protest against the tide and the bottom of the flatboat spanked the dark water . Joan tried to avoid looking at Toby , but somehow she kept looking at his seated figure in the stern of the boat . He sat with his arms on the steering lever and the vibration of the motor made his whole upper body tremble , so that even the cigarette in the corner of his mouth stuttered slightly . She twisted in her seat and looked away from him . Suddenly the motor stopped and the bow dropped beneath her . " Are we going to fish here , Toby ? " she asked . " Yessum . " He reached for her rod and began to thread the end of her line through a sinker , tying a small piece of matchstick with a slipknot several feet above the hook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His hands moved swift as machine parts , the long tapering fingers strong and sure . He reached into the bait pail and took out a live shrimp , hooking it through the base of the long-shaped head , just under the spinal cord . " All right , " he said , " you kin start to fish now . " She waited for him to bait her father 's hook , trailing her bait in the water to keep it alive . Then she saw him bait his own hook and with a flick of the wrist the bait shot out lazily , clear and free , to drop less than a foot from the gnarled mangroves that lined the bank . She cast herself and shortly had a strike . She set the hook hard and began to reel in line . After a few moments she was able to bring the fish to the surface and Toby lifted it into the boat . It was a small sand shark , and as it lay flopping at her feet the sun shone on its gray sides so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upward , its underside was soft and white as the stomach of a young rabbit . Toby picked it up and cut a long slit up the belly with his pocket knife , then threw it over the side of the boat . She saw it there on the surface , trying to swim down and away from them , its movements slow and uncertain as though it was paralyzed and must learn to swim all over again . The red of its blood , which had seemed so bright before , was now dulled and pulled thin by the water . She turned her head quickly , for although she knew it was a scavenger and must be done away with , she could only remember the beauty of it as it had come fresh from the water . " Hit wo n't be overly long , " Toby said slowly . " Them other sharks will smell him and come a hoppin . They 'll kill him fast . " She nodded dully . The sun was almost overhead . In a short time Toby reeled in his line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use to stay there . Seems like they jest ai n't in this spot . " He waited until they reeled in and then pulled up the anchor and started the motor . She felt the wind again at her face ; it was good now that the day had lost all trace of the morning coolness . Behind them she heard a boat whistle grunt and as she turned the outline of a shrimp boat showed large and gray to the rear . She watched it as it gained on them . At the cabin-house window she could see a young negro boy . He had on a battered straw hat with no top to the crown and there was an unlighted cigar butt screwed hard into the side of his mouth . He looked down at them and grinned as the boat passed . When Toby did not look up he yanked the whistle cord two short blasts and the force of his laughter shook his head from side to side . The wash rocked their boat gently as they swung round to take it broadside . The shrimper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , as though they were the only living things on the entire river and the memory of the battered , gray hulk were only something that she had imagined . They passed a tall post with a large white sign nailed near the top . There was a large , black arrow pointing south along the channel and painted across the face in bold red paint were the words : Miami 287 miles . They nosed toward a narrow opening off the main body of the river . After going up a sort of creek for a few hundred yards they came to a widening in the channel and Toby cut the motor . " I reckon we might as well fish fer trouts , " he said . " This chere is the place I had a party ketch twenty-eight last week . " The sun beat down and prickled her skin . She raised her face to the sky and let it bake for a few moments . Out of the bottom of her eyes she could see Toby 's bobber riding the choppy Little waves . Suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the fish was already away with the bait . He looked up at her and grinned . " Lest we know they 's one fish in chere , " he said , " but hit shore may be the only one . " Her eyes returned to her own bobber and she looked at it so long it became ablur , Time was something to be endured . The sun was high overhead and she was getting hungry . The late afternoon breeze that had come up with the change of tide pawed gently at the flour-sack curtains in the kitchen where Toby 's mother was sitting . In the distance she heard the sound of a motor . That must be Toby now , she thought , and laughed inwardly . Here he had been out all morning fishing with those two yankees and they had n't even had decent luck . Six long hours fishing and all they brought back was one sheepshead . It lay now on the table before her , ready for frying , because sheepshead was n't good enough for some people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had come in from the river at noon , Toby had gone fishing again . Toby 's just like his old man , she thought , always fishing . It just did n't seem the kind of work a man ought to do . It was something for spare time and not a way to earn a living . She remembered that she had talked to Toby 's father about it before he died , but he had just laughed and said it paid good . But that was n't what she meant . Suddenly she came out of the past with a start . Soon Toby would come stomping into the kitchen and likely as not he 'd be hungry . If there was no supper ready he 'd be cross as an old she bear with young'uns . She got to her feet and walked over to the stove . The skillet lay on the back of the range hot and ready . She rolled the two halves of fish in bread-crumbs and threw them into the hot grease . Presently she heard a noise behind her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the room , so tall that his head nearly touched the ceiling of the low room . Have ary luck , Toby ? " " Yeah , I ketched me six nice trouts . " He lapsed into silence momentarily , then went on , " Supper near ready ? " " Hit 's likely to be five or ten minutes more . I did n't rightly expect you so soon , Toby . Reckon though you do git hungry out there . Hit 'll be ready directly . " He walked angularly to the chair by the window and sat down , tilting the chair back against the wall . " I been a thinkin , " he said slowly . " Reckon as to how we cai n't use all them trouts . Jest ai n't no ways we kin keep them freshened up . I thought I might take me a couple to them folks I had out this mornin . Shucks , they did n't have no luck noways . " He looked up at her out of the corner of his eyes without raising his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He blew smoke at the ceiling . " Seems to me they kind of got a right to a fish fry . They paid me good and I rightly think they belong to have some of them trouts fer eatin . " She swung on her heel and looked at him hard , her hands on her hips and her body bent forward slightly . " Toby , " she said slowly . " God he my guide , that ai n't the way hit is and you know hit . Maybe I ai n't overly smart . I ai n't had much of a spell of book larnin but I kin see what I kin see . The only idee you got in takin them folks them trouts is so you kin git another peek at that young gal . Son , you an her ai n't likely to git nowheres noways . Hien I was you I shore would n't go . Likely as not you 'll git what you ai n't lookin fer . " She went to the window and spat . His eyes followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . I said I was goin to take them folks some of them trouts and that 's what I 'm aimin to do . " " You 'll likely be sorry . Shucks , that gal ai n't fer you . You and her ai n't cut from the same kind of cloth . Do n't you do hit , son . " He returned her deep look and shrugged . " Reckon I know my own mind better'n you do . Maybe she ai n't fer me , but she shore is a pert little thing , purty as ary picture ever I seen . Maybe I aim to see her and maybe I do n't . Like I said , I figure that to be my business . Right now I figure on gratin them trouts . Hit wo n't take me overly long so you 'd best have grub on the table time I 'm done . " He got to his feet and walked slowly toward the doorway . The firm set to his jaw told her the futility of saying anything more . The matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sway him . A feeling of frustration came to her and spread quickly over her whole body like a rash . " You mind what I said , " he told her curtly , then turned on his heel . Now that he was gone the room somehow seemed bigger again . A long gray streamer of pelicans soared low over the sand dunes . The sea lay muddy-colored as far as the eye could see and a shrimper moved northward toward Matanzas Inlet so slowly that from where Joan was seated on the terrace of the low white house it seemed scarcely to be moving at all . She closed her eyes and saw him  --  Toby  --  as he had looked that morning . She remembered the thin , hard look of him and the careless grace of the way he moved . She opened her eyes angrily and flicked her cigarette hard across the lawn toward the bank that browed the beach . Down toward the pink-stucco hotel she watched a late-afternoon bather , and with him she somehow felt the first sharp shock of contact with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the incoming waves on their frail , pipestem legs , the crazy quickness of their movements like those of a child running aimlessly in circles , only to get nowhere . Up the beach she saw a figure walking toward the place where she was seated . When it came nearer she saw that it was Toby . For a moment she thought of walking into the house so that he would not see her on the bank above him as he passed . But she did not move . When he was nearly opposite he turned in at the path which led up the bank to the house above . For a moment with the sun at his back , he was like something out of a hook , and then he was Toby again . He saw her and grinned . " I brung youall some trouts , " he said , throwing a gunnysack down at the side of her chair . " Seems you deserve of them not ketchin arythin when you fished all mornin . " She asked him to sit down and he sank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting . She offered him a cigarette , but he shook his head and lighted one of his own . He sat upright in the chair with his legs drawn up and cramped , so that as he looked out over the water he had the look of something misshapen . She opened the sack and saw the four fish within , the black specks distinct against the graceful , slime-shiny , silver bodies . " I ketched them down where we was about noon , " he said . " I ketched six . in all , one right spang after other . Reckon I war n't out but an hour . " " I must be bad luck , " she laughed . " The minute you get rid of me the fish start to bite . " " No , m'am , hit ai n't thataway noways . We just was fishin where they war n't . " He was silent again and his eyes returned to the water . In a short time he got to his feet . " I best be gittin back home now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daddy enjoys them trouts . " " Toby . " " M'arn ? " " Did you walk all the way up here with those fish ? " " Not all the way , Miss Joan . A man come along in a car and he done toted me better'n half way . " " It 's still a long walk and I want you to know how much we appreciate it . It was very sweet of you to think of it . " " Shucks , walkin ai n't nothin fer me . Times I gone out huntin quails and I reckon I walked the better part of twenty miles , maybe more . " " Well , you wo n't have to do it now . You wait here until I leave these fish in the kitchen and I 'll run you down in the car . " " Shucks , Miss Joan , I do n't want you to put yerself out none fer me . " But she was already gone . Behind him he heard the kitchen door slam faintly . The houses they passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they would n't get there so soon . He sneaked a look at her out of the corner of his eyes . He felt like a fool . Here he 'd come all that way and the things he had wanted to say had stuck in his throat like something he could neither swallow nor spit up again . He bit his lip so hard it hurt . There were no houses along the beach now ; soon it would be time to turn off on to the river road . The sun was beginning to sink slowly into the gray-green mass of the ocean . Out near shore he could see a school of porpoises feeding . They rolled playfully like young children suddenly and unexpectedly released from some unpleasant task . He pointed them out to Joan and she swung the nose of the car toward the water and stopped . Together they watched without speaking . Her nearness hurt him . He wanted to say something to show her the way he felt , but he could n't . Instead he said , " Reckon you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In a couple of weeks , Toby . " " I was hopin maybe you and him and me could go fishin agin . I thought the next time I knowed hit was a good day I 'd git in touch with youall . " " That 's a good idea , Toby . I know Dad would like to go out again . You 'll find our telephone number in the book . When the blues start running in the river you call me up . " She lapsed into silence and he was desperately afraid that soon she would start the car and drive off . He could feel himself getting tense the way he felt on his first deer hunt , and if something did n't happen , it did n't matter what , he was going to explode . It was almost dark and her face was soft and indistinct in the dim light . He inched his arm along the back of the seat behind her head . He saw that her eyes were closed . He bent suddenly and kissed her on the lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand soft on his cheek . Then she opened her eyes and pushed him away gently . For a moment she was quiet , looking up at the sky above her , but when he bent to kiss her again she resisted and when he tried to draw her to him she reached down and started the motor . He shut off the ignition and put the key in his pocket . He could feel his blood pumping and when he spoke his voice shook a little . " I ai n't even about ready to go yit . " " Give me the key , Toby , " she answered in a low even voice . " It 's late , and Dad might be worried about me . " " You liked it well enough before , " he said gruffly . " I know it . That 's the point . I do n't feel that way now . " He could feel his anger rising like a fever and he pulled her to him roughly . " Fight , damn it , that 's what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't got no spirit they ai n't no durn good . " She laughed and it stung him . " You sound like something out of a storybook , Toby . Give me the key . " Suddenly he knew that he was making a fool of himself and he hated her for it . " I might have knowed hit , " he said harshly . " You damn women are all the same . Cai n't tell one from tother . Jest let a man come along and you all do the same way  --  act sweet and invite God knows what by the way you carry on . Do like ary woman in a jookhouse to git a man to boilin . Come that time and you want to git on home . They got a name fer women like that and hit ai n't noways purty . I reckon you know what hit is . " He felt the sting of her hand across his face and slowly the burning sensation spread down over his neck . He took the key from his pocket and put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car door and got out . " Toby , " she called after him , " I did n't mean to do that . I lost my temper and I did it without thinking . I 'm really sorry . " " You 'd best to git . " " Toby , come back here a minute . I want to talk to you . " " I ai n't in no talkin mood . You 'd do best to git on home to yer daddy . I ai n't never hit no woman , excusin one that sure did need hit , and I ai n't wishin to do so now . I would n't wish you to stay chere and make me do something I ai n't liken to do . " He quickened his steps . Ma was sure as hell right , he thought ; I done went and made me out a fool for sure . That litty ole gal did n't fool Ma none , but she sure hooked me . Way she acts you might think she was pure gold and I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car far behind him now and he did n't turn round to see whether she was still there . He wanted to get as far away as he could . He started to run . He had n't noticed that the moon had come up behind him . When Cooney stepped into the moon-flooded clearing from the scrub it was like leaving a dark room . He stood for a moment listening , but everywhere the silence was thick as a blanket . Off toward the river the house stood in dark silhouette against the lighter sky . He started toward the house . An owl broke the silence harshly , and all at once the dogs came to him barking , shattering the night into pieces . He laughed throatily . " Smiler , " he called in a low voice , " whuh de hell wrong wid yuh , huh ? Say yuh cai n't see ole Cooney yuh kin sure smell um . " The bitch came to him fawning and nuzzled his hand with her long nose . He patted her gently and rumpled her ears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , huh ? Oughter , the time yuh been huntin wid Mistah Toby an me . " The bitch heeled as he walked on toward the house . When he came to the back stoop he called in a low voice , " Miz Johnson . " The sound of her heavy footsteps came to him before he could see the flickering light . Then he saw her through the screen door , her shadow cast huge against the kitchen wall , so that she looked strange and unnatural in the wavering light . " Who is that callin me ? " she asked , peering out the door into the darkness . " Iz me , Miz Johnson , Cooney . " " What do you want , nigger ? " " Wants tuh see Mistah Toby . Iffen he dere I gots tuh talk wid urn , Miz John-son . " " Toby ai n't chere now , Cooney . I reckon though he might be back directly . He 's gone up the beach a piece to see some folks . " " Iz all rite I wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 'll be all right , Cooney . " She went back into the front of the house with the lamp . Cooney walked over to the clump of trees near the road through the scrub and sat down with his back against an old cabbage palm . He drew his knees up to his chest and rested his chin against them . The bitch lay down beside him , nuzzling his leg to get his attention , whining softly and wagging her tail with affection . Absently he fooled with her ears . It was she , the bitch , who first sensed that someone was coming up the road . Her head came up sharply and she labored up off the ground . Cooney got up beside her and stood with the weight of his body rested against the trunk of the tree . A figure came out of the woods and he knew it was Toby by his walk . " Toby , " he called , " les me an yuh go fishin tomorruh . " " Nigger , you know you 're talkin to a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mistah Toby , I'z sorry . I jest forgit . Lissen , Mistah Toby , I knows whey de blues is runnin . I kin go whey de trouts bite de nakid hook . Knows whey dey 's a bass weight twenty-one pounds . He just waitin on us , Mistah Toby . De Mary Lou done blowed uh rod . Done come clean out de top de ingine , Mistah Toby . Les us go bout de time de sun come out . I gots de day off . " " Go on , nigger , " Toby answered angrily , " I ai n't got no time to be foolin with no good niggers . " He started to walk away toward the house . " Whus wrong , Mistah Toby , " Cooney asked , half running to keep up . " I ain foolin none . I knows whey dat ole bass iz at . He down by dat big clump uh mangooves tother side de big bar . Dey 's a deep pool dere an dat whey he at . Man , I seed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ git the hell on out of chere , hear ? " " Whuh yuh mad at , Mistah Toby ? Somepin I done done ? Didn I toot de whissle when I seed yuh in dat boat wid dem two white folkses ? I seed dat purty , litty ole gal an ' I knowed waivin de ban no good . I grob de cord an toot de whissle twict . I yanked er tail hard so yuh look up . Ole Cap like tub beat me , Mistah Toby , but I done done hit . " He grabbed hold of Toby 's arm and looked up at him intently in the dim light . He could n't understand what was wrong with Toby . " Nigger , you 'd best let go from aholt of me . " The way he said it did n't even sound like Toby 's voice . He said things like that lots of times when he was fooling , but something that he , Cooney , could not understand was different now . He looked at Toby again to see if he maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook off his arm roughly and hit him in the face . He went down with the blow , not because it was so hard but more that he had been caught surprised and off balance . He got to his feet slowly and stood rubbing his face . " Now you better listen to what I 'm say-in , nigger . I want you to git on away from chere . I do n't aim to have to hit you agin so you best git on home . " " Mistah Toby , " Cooney said slowly , " yuh dicin belong tuh do dat . Yuh didn belong tuh hit me . I done growed up wid yuh . Knowed yuh since yuh small as me . Done holped yuh an Mu/ Johnson all mull life . Yer mama neber in de wind lets yuh hit me dat away . I goin tuh tell she an she whop yuh good . " Toby looked down at him in anger . " Listen , you nigger bastard , you go to tellin my ole lady I hit you and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of your black head . And my ole lady ai n't tellin me off none either . You go-in to git ? " He reached down at his feet and picked up an oak bough as big around as his wrist . He tapped it against the palm of his hand and looked hard at Cooney until he backed off slowly and turned round and walked off into the scrub . Toby swung the stick hard against a nearby tree and it broke with a loud explosion . He could feel his hand tingling from the sting and he let the piece in his hand fall slowly to the ground . All his anger was suddenly gone and he felt limp and dazed . He turned and looked into the thickness of the dark scrub . " Cooney , " he called , then again , this time louder , " Cooney , come back there a minute . " But there was no answer . He shrugged his shoulders and started toward thehouse again . Now that he was himself he was sorry that he had hit Cooney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't meant to . It just happened when he was n't himself and he had n't even realized what he had done until it was all over . In some way he would have to make it up to Cooney . If he did that , Cooney , niggerwise , would forget all about it . Hell , he 'd go fishing with him in the morning . He 'd get up before daylight and walk over to where Cooney lived and wake him up . He 'd let him use his old rod and reel now that he 'd got that new one from Sears and Roebuck . They 'd get that bass too . He knew the one Cooney was talking about ; he 'd seen it himself . That would make it all right again . He might even let Cooney try his new rod a couple of times or maybe he ought to tell Cooney what had happened . Only he 'd make a good story out of it . Cooney , being a nigger , would n't know the difference and when he told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in the sand dunes , Cooney would sure hoot and holler .
