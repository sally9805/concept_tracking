On Jan. 22 , 1937 , some 1,500 residents of Shawneetown , Ill. , sheltered behind their 60-foot flood wall , lost contact with Harrisburg , Ill. , 23 miles away . The great Ohio Basin flood had cut them off from their nearest municipal neighbors and the world . As the flood waters rose , a Harrisburg ham ( amateur short-wave operator ) , Robert Tompkins Anderson , volunteered to set up an observation post as near as he could get to Shawneetown and establish two-way radio communication with relief agencies that were trying to bring help . <P> By truck and boat ( equipped with only one paddle ) , Amateur Anderson ferried his transmitter and receiver to a high spot six miles across the flood-swollen Wabash River from Shawneetown . When it became obvious that the Ohio would spill over Shawneetown 's flood wall , Shawneetown 's residents were evacuated to Indiana and Kentucky on orders received over Ham Anderson 's radio . Evacuation was effected without loss of a single life . And after four raw , wet , sleepless days and nights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American Radio Relay League , this 32-year-old father of two last week was selected for the 1937 William Samuel Paley Amateur Radio Award , a sculptural abstraction of aluminum rods and spheres . The Paley Award was founded in " recognition of relief work done by radio amateurs in the 1936 flood disasters . Last year it went to Coudersport , Pa. ' s Ham Walter Stiles Jr .
