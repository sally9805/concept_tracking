NO DOUBT it seems a poor cause to advocate , and I know that I choose a lonely , precarious position . But I have a reason , almost amounting to a purpose , and it is this : most of the people whom I like best are said to be snobs , and often the very qualities in them which arc most delightful seem to bring on the accusation . If these pleasant people are snobs I do not think that the word should be in such bad repute . Also , they are offended or insulted when they are so called . It seems fairly certain that there is either something unjust or mistaken in the characterization or else a fault in their own attitude which makes them so resentful of the word and so sensitive to its imputations . Men and women who will laugh at other criticisms of themselves or cheerfully profit by them almost invariably deny that they are snobbish , and they are often distressed or indignant when they refute the charge . Mary Blake , Catherine Eliot , Gerald Palmer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some of my friends , they are not one another 's intimates , and there can be no possible collusion between them . They live in various parts of the country . Their habits of mind and methods of living are entirely dissimilar , so neither the accusation nor the denial has a common basis in those facts . Snob is , beyond a doubt , a horrid little word , ugly in sound , unsightly in print . Wondering just what its powerwas , I hunted out the thickest and most impressive dictionary I could find , one with several thousand amazingly thin pages all decked and set about with knowledge . But the dictionary disappointed and failed me . It offered in explanation , " one who places a false and vulgar over-estimate on material possessions or fashionable standing . " That certainly does not describe Mary Blake , who lives in considerable detachment from material things and never can remember what is fashionable and what is not . " Such a one , " said the dictionary further , " as modifies his mental or outward attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the lack of them . " I can not see how that applies to Catherine Eliot , whose loyalty to her friends in and out of disgrace and bankruptcy has been a shining example . The word probably derives , according to Webster 's emporium of definition , from an original meaning of cobbler . Or it may have begun by being a term of contempt for a tailor . That lets out both Gerald and Mr. Blenker , for one is a capitalist and the other a lawyer and both are unconcerned about what they wear . It would be simple to assume that injustice has been done my friends and close the discussion . But I am not inclined to let it go so easily . If these people are popularly held to be snobs , and the dictionary can not accept them under that heading , we must see what usage has done to definition . The trouble is that the dictionary , for once , is not keeping up with meanings . Snob has simply run away from it , taking along a host of meanings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular usage is more important than its dictionary meaning both to the one who is using the word and to the one to whom it is attached . Everybody knows snobs in that dictionary sense . Those insecure people , whose pretensions never fit them very well , whose social life resembles the awkward , unrestful shape of a ladder , apparently must be endured . They are not a pleasant lot . They are at once arrogant and servile and they manage to do considerable bullying when they find people whose outlook is even narrower and more fearful than their own . But we all know what they are about , and the technic of dealing with them is simple enough . Like all bullies , they are more insolent than courageous . They are easily frightened , and many of them live all the time in a state of apprehension , and in a manner which approximates a sort of quarantine . They are always afraid of doing the wrong thing , of being with the wrong people . Of course , all their social alliances have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any moment . They try to be absolute about standards but they are copyists at heart and never sure of themselves . Indifference to their habits and opinions bewilders them and throws them into confusion . Nor do they ever have a very good time . Indeed , they work so hard at living and get so little fun out of it that perhaps it is better to be sorry for them . For , nuisances though they are , they are more so to themselves than to other people ; and some of them keep a great deal of money in circulation , which is an additional reason to tolerate them , especially in hard times . But the strange thing is that it is these dictionary snobs who most often have the word resentfully upon their lips , who insist that other people are the snobbish ones . It is they , I believe , who started the rumor about Mary . And when she says , " I 'm really not a snob , am I ? I do n't see why people think I am , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disassociate herself from that nervous crowd of men and women who are completely mistaken about values and who will always be absurd in manner . Mary is never absurd and rarely confused about values . She comes from a family which , through its interlockings and achievements , has been well known and highly regarded for many generations . Sometimes the members of it were rich and sometimes they were poor , but there seems usually to have been a flavor of elegance in their living . Mary herself is neither wealthy nor handsome . But she has a small income and she had the luck to marry a man she loved and to win his permanent devotion . Their home is not large or especially pretentious but it is always pleasant . They are apt to spend much more on service than most people with a like income and yet they are less self-indulgent than the average young Americans . Mary 's evening dresses always remind people of what is no longer worn and of how queer a fashion which has passed can appear . None the less , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guest conveys a certain distinction . She makes no such claim , of course . All she wishes to do is to surround herself with the people of whom she is fond . She is excessively kind to strangers who come to the city , if by some chance they know friends of hers in other places . Spreading her acquaintance at random would not interest her at all . She reads a good deal , talks intelligently , and never forgets to vote . She does not belong to any women 's clubs , not because of prejudice but because she sees no reason why she should spend money on dues or time on meetings . Of course , the circle of people who know her well is small , and she has a habit of repeating the same guests at her dinner parties . In a phrase , she is a woman who is not at everyone 's disposal socially . By that same token she is a snob . It is astonishing how often that comment is made about Mary , never by her friends but by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by those whose invitations she has not accepted , by those who have merely heard that she is " difficult to know . " Mary is aware of what they say and occasionally it troubles her . " I 'm not a snob , " she insists . " There 's nothing I hate worse than snobbishness . I did n't go to the Harris wedding because I hardly know the girl . But I like many different kinds of people . " So she does . But she chooses them . It is that which is not forgiven her . With Catherine Eliot the situation is differeut . Her great fortune has narrowed the paths of her life even while it has extended them . She is a copied , quoted person . Everything she does is apt to be conspicuous . She can not have a baby or get her tonsils removed without its being an extraordinary event , because whatever happens to her means the diversion of a great deal of money . She has beauty and youth and a genuine talent for friendship . But she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to exploit her acquaintance . In a way she is rather shrewd , though not infallible , about recognizing the difference between people who want her friendship and those who want to use it . She told me not long ago of an incident that discouraged her . A child-study group had been formed in her city , and she was asked to join it . Shewas glad to do so . She is an excellent mother and always glad to learn what she can about bringing up children and guiding them , so she went to a few meetings with considerable eagerness . " But what was the use ? " she asked . " The programs did n't amount to anything . What they really wanted was not to talk psychology but to have an excuse for spending a social afternoon . That was why I was asked . " She stopped attending the meetings and the remaining members rate her as a " fearful snob . " Still , her loyalties know no limit . When a friend of hers disgraced herself by going away with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a wretched impasse , it was Catherine who took up the cudgels for the girl . It was Catherine who sent her to a quiet place abroad to get her bearings and Catherine who quoted from her letters , and defended and explained her case , until people began to realize how much fineness there was in the girl . She did all that against opposition and hostility . Catherine can be quite wistful sometimes . She feels that her wealth is a barrier . She is really a simple person and very successful in campaigns for charity . I have known her to go from door to door in districts where people did not know her and not only collect small sums of money but leave good will and friendliness behind her . None the less , there is no converting common opinion . She is held a snob . She wishes that it were not so . But she does not know what to do about it . Gerald , on the other hand , fights back . " I 'm not a snob , " he insists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that because I 'm not a Joiner . That 's what has hung the bad name on me . I hate luncheon clubs because they sing songs and because they are so hearty and because they assume that everyone wants roast beef at twelve-fifteen on c ? IN DEFENSE Thursday . I have n't a hearty manner , and it 's one of the things that ca n't be faked . Fin just not a mixer and I do n't see what earthly good it would do anyone if I tried to pretend that I am . My enthusiasms run slowly . I 'm perfectly ready to do my share for the community if I can lunch at a club where nobody sings and theycook individual portions . " Hardly anyone is considered such a snob as Gerald Palmer . Not even Mr. Blenker . Mr. Bleaker has many friends but few intimates . He always lives at arm 's length . Even those of us who have talked to him for hours on end have somehow never got to the first-name point . He is a man well on in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is delightful to talk to , for he has a wealth of knowledge and not only on points of law . He understands people as well as books , knows character as well as places . He is certainly not an optimist but he is a pleasant companion and a great diner-out during these last few years since he has become adjusted to his wife 's death . He dines out continually but not indiscriminately . He knows various groups of people , and yet he is called a snob , not once or twice , but commonly so by people who have seen him draw fine mental lines between this and that , by hostesses whose invitations he will not accept , by those who have had no opportunity to know him , and never will have . For Mr. Blenker goes to those houses only in which he thinks he will be pleased with the company . He has a sincere liking for cultivated and educated people , good food , gin that is not synthetic , bridge that is not impulsive . He does not pretend otherwise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a snob . There is a quality among these four men and women that repeats itself even in this scant description . They show not only a power of discrimination but an accomplishment of selection . That is why they are resented , why they are tagged as snobbish . The very fact that they have a sense of direction seems to annoy people . It excites jealousy , and of course that is not unnatural . For so many people are fumbling , even in regard to their own ambitions , that they are bound to envy and resent a firm , defined attitude and inevitably moved to cry it down . I have taken rather obvious cases . I have not mentioned Miss Helen Graff , who was the most intellectual woman I have ever known and who always appeared to be sifting people and things through the superfine mesh of her mind . She did it obviously . She did it not so mercilessly as scientifically . There was very little worth saving when her sifting was done , not very much fit for her use . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have since heard it said that she was always a mental snob . A mental snob , to be sure , is supposed to be of a higher order than other snobs . The men or women who choose their friends only among those who give peace or stimulus to the mind , who will not bother with the unintelligent , may be no better liked than the social snobs , but the pack is never after them quite so hard . They may set themselves apart , draw themselves up , close themselves off , hut if their reason is that they wish to devote their time to high thinking , they will be more easily forgiven than if they devoted their energies to high living . I suppose that not so many people covet the former as the latter kind of life , and tolerance breeds accordingly . Then too there may still be a lurking tradition left from the days when most philosophers and poets and teachers sought retreats instead of crowds . I know one woman who is quite ruthless in her judgments on intelligence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She lets that be freely known . She is entirely frank about her criticisms and judgmentsand , strangely enough , she has created a certain vogue for them and for her own spirited highhandedness . People who do not even know her will be heard defending her point of view , asking why so clever a person as she is should " bother with " stupid companionship . She is conceded to be a snob , but the concession seems to have little sting in it . Yet one of her friends who , with infinite grace and tact , draws invisible lines about a highly desirable and glamorous social circle arouses the intense envy and dislike of those without it . If , as this would seem to prove , one person is sometimes granted a right to be exclusive which is contested in another , we should be able to unearth a code of rules . What gives an unchallenged right to establish values and go one 's way ? Is it the mind , or the accident of birth , or the large house on the hill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high must one go before one is given authority in these matters ? Is it proper for the wife of a President but unseemly in the daughter of a Governor ? How many banks must one own ? How many books must one have published ? Is it the Social Register or " Who 's Who " which decides in the end ? Is it a matter of local option ? Does it get down to a consideration of small puddles or big frogs ? This can become very confusing and very difficult to work out in any kind of social mathematics . We can not even be sure whether we are dealing with pyramids or concentric circles , with plane or solid geometry . The only thing to do is to get back to the individual . No one can deny the right of each person to set up his own values of life if they are not socially destructive . It is only when there is an attempt to force these values on everyone else that the thing becomes insolent . I have never been affronted by anybody , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if he was willing to let other people 's habits and philosophy alone . There are a good many roads by which one may approach satisfaction and happiness and accomplishment , and each individual has a right to choose his own way and follow it without interference . But he has no right to assume that it is the only way , and I have felt the air as heavy with assumptions of that sort at a Communist meeting as in certain drawing-rooms and at Republican banquets . The trouble with those snobs whom the dictionary describes is that they must have an audience , or a claque at least , even if they pretend to ignore it . They are never self-sufficient . They want to impose their ideas of what is important and fitting on someone else . They want reassurance and applause , even if it comes from the rabble outside the fence . That kind of snobbishness would die out very quickly on a desert island . The woman who sits down beside me and insists on dragging the reluctant talk to the story of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value of that event by forcing me to act as audience . Those wearying and transparent persons who are always inserting irrelevant names and dates and tales of past triumphs into a conversation are only trying rather pathetically to bolster up a shaky importance . Snobs of this type know that it is impossible for them to stand alone . It is perhaps a secret doubt of the values which they have accepted and which they must pass on even if they are half aware they are putting counterfeits into circulation . HI I am inclined to believe that the whole difference between such snobs and a person like Mary Blake lies in their perceptions of reality . It is the reason why Mary is self-sufficient and why they are not . Without talking very much about it , Mary sees her part for what it is . She knows that she has the luck to be more finely bred and better educated than the average . She knows too that she will never know or understand all kinds of people . Certain pleasant things have come her way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share all of them . For she thinks that life is highly personal and must be limited and that her business is to make the most of her fragment of it . She is an individualist , like Gerald Palmer , going her own way because it seems the only honest , unfaked , sensible thing one can do . She deals in small quantities of people and makes up her groups of persons she likes according to her taste . Individualists are often confused with snobs , and possibly by this time the meaning of the latter word has become so loose and scattered that it includes individualism . In that ease , there really should be a little revision of that fragment of Webster 's dictionary to which I have referred . It has become necessary . Catherine Eliot is not an individualist . She is a social person but she too has a clear perception of what is actual . She sees herself fitted into the pattern of society , part of its mosaic . The power of money is one thing she under-stanch very well . Rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become before wealth and she has no idea of confusing flattery with friendship or adulation with liking . It is obvious to her that she must always be cut off from many things and that it is a common experience . There is , so far as she can see , no solution in pretense . That is why she is quickly out of patience with a child-study class which is only a masquerade for a few social ambitions . Mr. Blenker , who has met her once or twice , and likes her , calls her one of the " unblinded rich . " No doubt he feels that she has something of his own feeling toward society . He knows that its group manifestations are artificial and largely material , that living is distinctly pleasanter when the company is good , and that there is not very much one can do when the company is poor . He is sure that he would not be a desirable addition to a dull group so why should he enter one ? If there is something inherently snobbish in seeing things clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snobs that so many people consider them . Otherwise , they and others like them should be promptly cleared of the accusation . Beyond a doubt the word is a splendid catch-all . Looking my own acquaintance over , it seems to me that almost everyone I know who has individuality , who makes no pretenses to a false or romantic order of living , who admits that social contacts are what they are , has at one time or another been referred to as a snob . It seems such an unfortunate and inadequate description of their qualities of discrimination and personal reservation and developed tastes . When I hear the word snob , these people do not come to my mind as illustrations . I recall instead a woman who uses up all the air in the room describing how her grandmother used to live in pomp and splendor . I think involuntarily of those who make social capital out of incidental contact with celebrities . I am reminded of a newcomer to the city who cautiously asked whom she should cultivate so that she " would n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who exclaimed proudly , " AM the swells in town are on this committee of mine ! " Snobbery of this kind has no food value for truly important people . But it is , I suppose , many times the whole sustenance of the unimportant . A great many servants seem to use it as a drug , to dull an ignominy which they feel in their own position . It is a matter of pride to them that their employers are richer or more important than other servants ' employers . Vicarious pride can , it is true , be a very fine and noble thing but only when the quality which arouses the admiration is understood and admired for itself , and not because it sheds reflected glory . Last year in England I had a cook who claimed that she had been employed by the rich and illustrious in what she spoke of as great houses . She never allowed herself to forget that . Once I ordered some grapefruit , and on the following morning it appeared on the table , uncut , still in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained how grapefruit was served in the United States and what had to be done to make it appetizing to serve and comfortable to eat . " Yes 'm , " she said , " I 've seen it done that way in great ' ouses . But it 's the work of the butler . " Apparently it was more than laziness with her . It was a matter of asserting superiority by claiming inferiority . She was by all odds as bad a snob as I have ever encountered . Her snobbishness was not only for herself . It was a vicarious snobbery for the English servant system . At any rate , I let the matter of the grapefruit go . That is one thing that can always be done with manifestations of snobbishness . You can ignore them , and the wind goes out of their sails almost immediately . These are the kind of persons who seem to me to fit the accepted definition of snob . But if men and women who are truly admirable are to come under the same appellation , there should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is sound snobbery as well as unsound snobbery or else there should be a penalty for flinging the word around so carelessly . IV For it hurts people . As I said in the beginning , it distresses or angers nearly everyone to be called snobbish . It is partly on account of the mentally unsightly , badly motivated lot one is thrown with . But even that hardly explains the worry of honest people over that particular accusation . There is a sting in it that gets under people 's skins . Something inherent in the American consciousness makes us particularly sensitive to the charge , and I think the reason for that goes very deep into our tradition . Without saying very much about it , most of us try to believe in democracy and at least prefer not to thwart it . To be called a snob is to be accused of being traitorous to an ideal that is our own , and of violating a fine tradition . I do not mean to suggest that we think this out whenever we are told that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is instinctive , and it may be the reason why the fear of becoming a snob arouses a sense of social responsibility . People defend themselves against the slur in a manner which is usually out of proportion to the consideration they give other criticisms . They worry about it , hunt in their own minds for traces of false values . There is an innate fear that one would not belong anywhere if he were discovered to be a snob . It would be like being a person without a country . Snobs have no standing in the United States . There is no place for them here . There are countries in which they are admired , or at least accepted . There is , on the other hand , Russia , where snobbery is disgraceful and individualism almost treason . But the United States remains neither fish nor fowl . Class distinction exists but recognition of it must stay under cover . Snobs are undemocratic . All men are free and equal . It is outrageous to see what meanings have been read into that sentence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of a staff . They have been misinterpreted to mean that the natural selectivity of a developing culture was somehow wrong , and that the tendency of people to seek the company of those they enjoyed must not be carried too far for the sake of the safety of democracy itself . The sentence was made over into a slovenly one which claimed that " everyone is just as good as everyone else . " To deny that is heresy . Fortunately there does seem to be plenty of heresy . Every intelligent document written about present-day America denies that all of us are uniformly " good " ( whatever that may mean ) , and seriously questions much of our equality and most of our freedom . A great many pretenses have their backs against the wall . But books are only books , and the ideal of equality as a fundamental of social life is implanted very deeply in children at a very early age . The danger to my mind is that this ideal may be like one of those laws , among them those regulating liquor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the national Constitution but are nullified by common practice . It seems as if it would be much more wholesome to keep the ideal in consonance with actuality , with truth , and possibility For otherwise children grow up with inhibitions which prevent them from admitting what they soon see , the vast differences between the natural capacities of men and the even greater difference that education and habit and training and even the possession of money can make , It results in a great deal of surface falsity , because people know one thing and pretend that another is true . Business and politics find it very often to their advantage to encourage the pretense . They use it for flattery . They turn it into a makeshift camaraderie for use in campaigns and in some offices . And those who do not follow the procession along the indicated line of march are written off as snobs . They do not like that . Many of these so-called snobs want deeply and rather wistfully to do their social duty , to be good citizens . It is that which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be guided by their own convictions . They know that the best they can do is to work through their own methods of limitation and selection and not try to beat down their own temperaments or environments . Selectivity is still unpopular in America . Give it its head and there is no telling how far it might go . Certainly it would mean harder work for the politicians . So many of their truisms would be demoded . It would mean that tired phrases and clich ? s would be abandoned by many a roadside . But these are only things that float on the surface of politics , and underneath little that is valuable would be altered . There is no reason why it should be . In business the same thing is true . The assumption that everyone has an equal chance in the business world is nothing but an assumption and could be brushed away without altering facts . Even in social life things would remain much as they are . But a greater demonstration of frankness and honesty in social relations , a more natural acceptance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of jobs . If this democracy were really the unpleasant mixture that so many of its professional defenders imply there would be little use or benefit in making even this much protest against a false situation . But it is not . Aristocrats and democrats , all thinkers , well aware of natural discriminations , founded it and they had no idea of going against nature . They intended to adjust a society to nature . Perhaps we need a few fearless , strong-minded aristocrats ? I may even mean snobs ? now . I was talking to a very wise man only the other day about a public celebration he was managing . He is a very popular man , with devoted , real friends everywhere . Nobody questions his hold on an immense public or his belief in and hopes for democracy . But as he outlined his plans I saw that they were marked by a careful selection of people . He accented the dignity and importance of some men at the expense of others . He picked his way among people , choosing here , rejecting there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears rather snobbish . And you 're not a snob . " He smiled , as if that were amusing . " Oh , yes I am , " he said , " and so is everybody else . "
