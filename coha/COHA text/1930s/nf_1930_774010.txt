txt // of New England in order to find liberty to impose their own especial brand of religious tyranny . In England the Protestant sentiment came to a head in 1588 in a series of scurrilous pamphlets against the bishops of the established Anglican Church ( it is also called the Church of England , and in doctrine corresponds to the Protestant Episcopal Church in America ) . The government , however , violently suppressed these " Martin Marprelate " tracts ; and a few years later the queen 's Church found a defender in Richard Hooker , whose Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity is a defense of the Anglican system , raised to the level of great literature by its masterly prose style . A well coordinated , moderately Protestant Church , closely bound to the State , and partly Catholic in organization and doctrine , was Elizabeth 's solution of the religious question . And it is worth noting that this solution saved England from the religious wars that were devastating the Continent ; that it practically out-moded the detestable conception of heresy , and substituted treason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and State in a uniform system broad enough to include almost all shades of belief and flexible enough to adjust itself to the changing needs of the nation ; that it permitted the new spiritual vitality of the Reformation to work into English life ; and finally , that it gave as little occasion as possible for the use of thumbscrews and stake , and judged men for their acts only , without worrying about their beliefs and their consciences . It is also worth noting that this conservative , compromise solution was probably made possible not only by Elizabeth 's skill but also by the comparatively tepid state of religious feeling in England . And the solution did // nothing to disturb that tepid state ; it left Englishmen for a time free to cultivate the violent sensuous delight they had learned to take in life ; it permitted the full flower of the Renaissance to come in England to a late and splendid blooming , safe from the blasting breath of Reformation zeal . If the queen 's first problem was that of the Church , her most severe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France , Scotland , and the Netherlands were her chief worries ; the Papacy , the Empire , and Ireland were minor problems ; and all these states , in every conceivable combination , plagued her all through the half century of her reign . Any man would have gone to pieces in a week under the pitiless pres-sure of emergencies none of which were ever disposed of . But for Elizabeth it was all a magnificently involved and protracted game ; she throve in playing it . The longer she could put off action in any crisis , the better ; while she re-frained from any one course , she retained her choice over all courses , until circumstances forced her to make a cer-tain move which was , most likely , what she should have done all along . The warp upon which all of Elizabeth 's foreign policy was woven was Spain . There was a fundamental antipathy between England and Spain which had not in any way been eased by Mary Tudor 's marriage to the Spanish Philip II , son of the powerful Emperor Charles V @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain was strongly Catholic ) . To complicate matters , the Spanish infantry-men were the finest soldiers in the world ; Spain was becoming mighty through // exploration and trade in the Orient and the New World ; and she had become a close and dangerous neighbor to England through Philip II 's control of the Netherlands , England 's wool-market just across the Channel . Philip , moreover , wished to carry out the policy he had begun in marrying " Bloody " Mary ; he wished to restore England to the papal fold , and to control it as an additional weapon in his armament against his rival , France . Philip 's first step was to propose marriage to Elizabeth , as he wished to ally himself with her against the Scotch queen Mary Stuart , who had married the Dauphin Francis of France . Elizabeth had no intention of marrying him , but she kept him waiting as long as possible while she strengthened her own position . Philip , in the meantime , was distracted by uprisings against him in the Netherlands ; and even after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept at peace with England . For one thing , he did not wish to drive the island kingdom into the arms of his rival , France ; for another , he hoped that sooner or later he would get England anyway , for Francis of France had died in 156o , and Mary Stuart had returned to Scotland to reign over her kingdom . And Mary Stuart , a good Catholic and a direct descendant of Henry VII , was heir to Elizabeth 's crown ; in fact , thought many English Catholics , Mary Stuart was already by right queen of England , rather than the illegitimate daughter of Anne Boleyn ! So Philip , who liked waiting , waited . During the years while the situation hung fire , Elizabeth was not idle . She secretly encouraged her bold sea-rovers to prey upon Spanish shipping , and when Philip retaliated // by attacking Drake , in Mexico , Elizabeth seized Philip 's treasure ships as they sailed through the Channel bound for the Spanish Duke of Alva in the Netherlands . And then the queen proceeded to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had a right to the loan , as she had rescued it from Channel pirates ! Slowly the crisis drew nearer ; Drake pillaged the Spanish colonies , and Elizabeth acknowledged his services pub licly ; the leader of the Dutch revolt against Philip , William " the Silent " of Orange , was assassinated ; Elizabeth sensibly rejected the offer the Netherlands made her of their crown , and sent instead an ineffective expedition under her favor ite , Leicester , which did nothing except give Sir Philip Sidney the chance to end a noble life nobly at Zutphen . " Thy necessity is greater than mine ! " said the wounded courtier-poet , and gave a cup of precious water to a dying soldier at his side . And still Philip refrained from attack , though Drake 's depredations became ever more bold and severe . Mary Stuart , exiled from her own country long since , was a prisoner in an English castle , and a center for English rebellion against Elizabeth ; and through Mary Stuart , Philip still hoped to have his will at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a twin kling . Mary Stuart was beheaded . At once Philip began his preparations to invade England . His first ships were destroyed when Drake raided Cadiz itself ; but the work went on , until in midsummer a great fleet , the Armada , sailed from Spain . Its purpose was to control the Channel and to help Philip 's general , the Duke of Parma , cross from the // Netherlands with an army to invade and conquer England . The expedition of the Armada ended in complete failure ; due partly to the unfamiliar naval tactics of the English , and partly to the weather . Composed of clumsy ships , overloaded with unskilled sailors and haughty soldiers who disdained to lend a hand and who had no conception of open-sea fighting on isolated boats , the Spanish fleet was at the mercy of the English . A swarm of privateers swelled the number of Elizabeth 's vessels ; the English boats , though small , were swift and sure ; their armament was splendid , and they were manned by toughened sea dogs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught by Drake to stand shoulder to shoulder with the mariners at rope or cannon . English tactics in the Channel harassed the Armada ; English fireships , set loose to drift down the wind , demoralized the Spanish anchorage at Calais ; North Sea fogs and storms gave the finishing touches . The pitiful remnants of the Armada , after sailing around the British Isles , finally made their way back to Spain ; England was saved . Philip II lived for ten years more , but the Armada 's defeat started Spain 's decline . It did not , however , make England mistress of the seas ; the Netherlands still surpassed her . Elizabeth seems to have known her own limitations , and she resisted the attempts of her advisers to force her into an aggressive war against Spain and the Spanish colonies . Desultory hostilities continued , as evidenced , for example , by the capture of the English ship Revenge by the Spaniards in 1591 , which was the occasion for a brilliant prose pamphlet by Sir Walter Raleigh describing the heroic outcome of the event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took as the subject for one of his most moving poems . But the defeat of the Armada , undoubt edly the greatest single event in Elizabeth 's reign , was also the climax of her conflict with Spain , and we must turn now to other phases of her foreign policy . The relations between England and Scotland during the latter half of the Sixteenth Century were inextricably tangled with the relations between the two queens , Elizabeth and Mary . Mary Stuart , the daughter of James V of Scotland , was born in 1542 ? nine years after Elizabeth Tudor . As vigorous , as brave , as talented as the English queen , Mary excelled her by the priceless possession of a personal charm that brought all men to their knees before her . But her great weakness , as a sovereign , lay in the fact that she could not sacrifice her heart for her country . Gladly she gave all for love , though that all included her kingdom and her life . Her im petuousness , her charm , her generosity of heart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she was infinitely less as a queen . Her girlhood she spent in France as the wife of the Dauphin Francis , while her mother , the French Mary of Guise , ruled Scotland as Regent . Two years after Eliza beth 's accession , however , in 1560 , the Scottish " Lords of the Congregation , " a band or " Covenant " of Protestant nobles organized by the able and rabid Calvinistic reformer , John Knox , threw off French influence and made their country Protestant . In the same year the French Regent died , and also Mary Stuart 's husband , Francis ; and in the following year the brilliant young widow returned to Scot-land to rule her own kingdom with her own hand . // Elizabeth was now in a delicate situation ; the English queen had undoubtedly lent aid to the rebellious Lords of the Congregation ; it was to her interest to encourage Protestantism , to check Catholicism and French influence in the neighboring kingdom , and to discourage Mary Stuart 's claim to the English crown . On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiery , woman-hating John Knox was hardly a man after her own heart , and his brand of Protestantism she detested ; and she had every reason to encourage subjects in their loyalty to a female sovereign . Entangled among these conflicting considerations , trying to maintain her own balance among Calvinists , Anglicans , Catholics , Scots , Englishmen , rebels , loyalists , allies , rivals , Frenchmen , Spaniards , and a score of other parties , Elizabeth muddled along , staving off Mary 's pretensions to England , until Mary herself , by a supreme act of spirited folly , solved the difficulty . The Scottish queen had taken as her second husband her cousin Henry Stuart , Lord Darnley ; and to him she had borne a son , the future King James VI of Scotland and I of England . But Darnley was a detestable weakling ; Mary and he soon quarreled , and he answered her contempt by murdering her Italian secretary Rizzio almost at her feet . To cap the climax Mary fell in love with a swashbuckling noble , the Earl of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Darnley , lying ill in a lonely house near Edinburgh , Kirk o'Field , was killed by a gunpowder explosion . Whether or not the famous casket letters , which implicated Mary , were genuine , she was undoubtedly morally guilty ; and when she married Bothwell , after a farcical // trial and acquittal , Scotland rose in horror against her . On the spur of the moment she fled for refuge ? to England ! And there , in 1568 , Elizabeth threw her into prison , and kept her for the nineteen bitter years until her execution . With the Scottish nation England could now at last be at peace ; and this peace , the prelude to political union between the two countries , has endured practically unbroken ever since . But Mary in her English prison lived on as a thorn in Elizabeth 's side , and as a peerless heroine of romance to inspire writers in later days , even to the time of Swinburne and Maurice Hewlett and John Drinkwater . Mary was valuable as a pawn in Philip II 's game ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the enemies of Elizabeth . The great nobles of the north , members of proud old families like the Percys and the Nevilles who despised the Protestant upstart , rose in rebellion ; but Queen Elizabeth crushed them and executed their leaders ; having broken these dangerous rivals of her rule , she was able to install her own loyal followers in positions of trust in northern England . Mary now began plotting to get her cousin-queen assassinated . But Elizabeth and her secret agents were not inactive in uncovering Mary 's intrigues , and the loyal English demanded the execution of this dangerous and fascinating serpent in their midst . Elizabeth , who disliked the idea of beheading queens , and who herself found Mary useful in putting off Philip II , hesitated . But at last in 1586 Mary 's part in the Babington assassination plot was proved beyond a doubt ; and in the following year Elizabeth yielded to pressure and allowed her council to work their will ; Mary Stuart , Queen of Scots , was beheaded . // With France , Elizabeth was as successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotland . In the early years of her reign the French statesmen , unwilling to force her into an alliance with Spain , were careful to avoid open hostilities ; later Eliza-beth eased the situation by dallying with the prospect of marriage to the French Duke of Alencon ; and the French themselves were seriously pre-occupied with internal struggles between the Protestant Huguenots and the Catho-lic party led by the great family of Guise . It was in Ireland that Elizabeth 's policy broke down ? in Ireland , where English statesmen have made so many fatal mistakes . Henry VIII , by extending his political and religious system in the neigh-boring isle , had aroused fearful animosities . Native resist-ance to the English Protestant Reformation was fast mak-ing Ireland the most devoutly religious spot in western Europe , and , as a hot-bed of anti-Protestantism and Anglo-phobia , it was becoming an attractive vantage point for Spanish and Catholic attacks against England . The queen decided to meet this situation by Angliciz-ing the island thoroughly ; to effect this result she sent over more soldiers , and established new English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-sulted in the famous Plantation of Ulster in the next reign . Many men close to her at court , or important in the life of the times ? her friend Sir Walter Raleigh ; her poet Edmund Spenser ; Richard Grenville , destined to be hero of the Revenge ? went over to Ireland on this enterprise . Gradually for a time conquest advanced and colonization spread , despite severe setbacks such as the failure of Essex 's // administration . This royal favorite , a stepson of the ad-mired Leicester , was drawn into a court quarrel as a result of his unceremonious return from Ireland . Shake speare 's play about a deposed king , Richard II , was pro duced at this time perhaps because it contained propaganda favorable to Essex 's revolt against his court rivals ; and when Essex lost his head for treason in i6oi , Shakespeare 's patron , Southampton , fell into disgrace . In the following year Essex 's successor seemed to have accomplished a final settlement of the Irish turmoil , and the queen may have died believing that even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . In the internal affairs of her kingdom Elizabeth 's tact was as fine , and her eventual control as effective , as in her handling of religious and foreign relations . She drew to herself all religious parties by refusing to go to extremes with any of them ; similarly , having insisted upon her own legitimacy and right to the throne , she refused to take any definite steps toward mar riage or toward naming her successor ; she thus succeeded in keeping all factions guessing , and inevitably dependent on her . Afraid to alienate her people by high taxes or to give Parliament a weapon against her , she lived as thriftily as she could on what she had , and rarely summoned Parlia ment to meet . When the legislators did meet , the House of Lords was so weakened by the decay of the older aristoc racy that the Commons , vitalized by the addition of new mercantile and political blood , had the upper hand . And Elizabeth dominated the policy of the Commons , usually by sheer aggressiveness , except in those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace-fully removed her pressure . The queen 's influence over the House of Commons was in some instances strengthened by " packing , " a process that lasted for centuries . The queen took advantage of the fact that some of the members were elected from city districts called boroughs ; she created new boroughs , often in out-of-the-way , sparsely settled rural districts , and secured the elec tion of absentee politicians who would follow her bidding as representatives of these boroughs . A Parliament " packed " with members representing these artificial bor oughs could be easily handled . In spite of the poverty of the national treasury , Eliza beth kept the taxes low , and gave her Parliament little work to do . Much of the machinery of the government was operated by the Court of High Commission , a new court formed to administer the laws controlling the Church . But the bulk of the work which the queen herself did not do was handled by her Privy Council , a group of statesmen including her most important advisers : William Cecil , Lord Burleigh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sir Francis Walsingham , who looked after foreign affairs and represented the bolder military party ; and Nicolas Bacon , Lord Chancellor , whose son Francis , author of the inimitable Essays , helped prose-cute his own patron Essex for treason , and in the next reign rose to great political heights before he was crushed by dishonor and disgrace . These men , and other members of the new aristocracy founded on wealth , brains , or power , which the Tudors built up to support themselves and to fill the place of the // vanishing feudal nobility , served Elizabeth wisely and well . The queen also made use , in governing her realm , of the personal favorites with whom she flirted , chief among them the handsome , worthless Leicester , at whose castle of Kenil worth Elizabeth was regally entertained , and Essex , who finally fell a victim to his own ill-advised ambition . This , then , was the governmental machine that Eliza beth built up and operated , and from which the modern English State developed . It was a compact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Euro pean politics ; England had at last learned the bitter lesson of the Hundred Years ' War ? to avoid entangling interests on the Continent . The nation was beginning to realize that its true future lay on the high seas and in a far-flung inter-continental empire . It was the queen herself who helped the nation to that realization . Encouraged by Elizabeth , English traders , explorers , and adventurers penetrated into Russia , North America , and the Orient , establishing new commercial contacts . Under Elizabeth the famous East India Company was organized , which laid the foundations of Great Britain 's present Indian Empire . One of Elizabeth 's sea-dogs , Hawkins , opened the negro slave trade by stealing African savages and sell ing them as laborers in America . One of her favorites , Sir Walter Raleigh , whom tradition associates with the episode of the cloak and the mud-puddle , colonized Virginia , naming it for his queen . The sea-rover whom Elizabeth knighted in defiance of Philip of Spain , Francis Drake , sailed an English ship around the world and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // In the year after the Armada , and again a decade later , Hakluyt published his fascinating Principall Navigations , an account of the great English voyages . And during the time that these adventurous sea-enterprises were taking place , England was gaining new footholds all over the globe , and English shipping and English maritime power were increasing . The growing trade , in which the queen herself invested heavily , stimulated domestic industry . It was in the beginfling the need for finding ocean routes over which the bulky English manufactures , cloth in particular , could be transported , that encouraged exploration . As commerce flourished , so did industry . Traders brought home profits in goods and gold , and only too often the additional profits of piracy . Manufacturers found new and richer markets for their products . And Elizabeth , calling in the old , debased currency , replaced it with pure , new coins that gave English commerce a firm financial basis . The English people grew prosperous , wealthy , happy . Relieved of the burden of heavy taxes , they saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses . And though the queen was left too poor to buy their help in times of emergency , her subjects were rich enough to give the aid she needed , giving their hearts along with it . Naturally a state of affairs which was at heart so flourish-ing , so sound , affected profoundly the social life of the nation . With the disappearance of the old feudal aristocracy , one great barrier between the sovereign and her people vanished . Elizabeth 's interest in her subjects , the imaginative sympathy between // the queen and the man in the street , their common enterprises over the seas or against the Pope or Philip , and their common success all strengthened the bond between queen and commoner , and encouraged the development of a sturdy middle-class population , part urban , part rural , the backbone of the nation . And , as this new class became conscious of its own existence ; as it looked around in dawning awareness of its own power , its own achievements against feudalism and the Roman Church and the might of Spain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can wonder that it shouted aloud in its delight , and turned to attack new problems with all the gusto of a free , interested individualism . As the new middle class grew in numbers and in wealth , the standards of living changed . The frowning feudal castles , with their moats and battlements , disappeared ; and rambling country houses or town mansions grew up in their stead ? delightful places in which to live , built of brick or timber and plaster in the pleasant Tudor style , open to sun and air through their newly introduced movable windows of glass , fresh and dry within , with bright carpets replacing filthy old rushes on the floors . Men began to pay more attention to cultivating their own fields , despite the revival of hard feeling over the enclosure of common land ; farming , hunting , and similar delightful occupations increased ; and with new wealth came new comforts , new luxuries ? tables were bright with silver and crystal , and rich foreign wines helped wash down English beef . The growing prosperity of country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cities ; side by side rural and urban England developed together without rivalry . In the towns , where industry was centered , young men were trained to the various crafts by the system of apprenticeship . And when the apprentice system was made uniform for town and country by the passage of Eliza beth 's Statute of Artificers , in 1563 , another step was taken in economic and social progress . For two centuries this beneficent law strengthened the backbone of the nation by providing education and discipline for the rising genera tion . There was , however , another side to the picture ; Eliza bethan England was not Utopia . Superstition still swayed the minds of men , disease was prevalent , and among the lowest classes poverty was so severe that extensive Poor Laws had to be passed in 16o1 . The rapid increase of wealth among manufacturers and traders brought about a new and sharp distinction between classes . The last years of Elizabeth 's reign were saddened by the loss of some of her favorite ministers , by her own old age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ple . Puritan agitators were disturbing the Church , the Irish situation was troublesome , men grumbled whenever the queen granted a monopoly or right to deal exclusively in some commodity . The independent temper of the Eng lish resented the queen 's absolutism , and her arbitrary re fusal to name her successor . But this drab picture is true of a few years only . The great queen 's reign , as a whole , teemed with rich , vigorous life , potent and diversified ; and out of that life sprang the culture of Elizabethan England . // When Leicester wished to do honor to his queen in masques and pageants at Kenilworth , he could lay at her feet the treasures of a world newly doubled in time and space by the researches of scholars and the voyages of adventurers . The beauties of classic art and literature , the wealth of the Spanish Main , scholarship , medieval legend , side by side with native English sport and plenty ? all were at the service of the queen who had herself helped make them available . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Primarily through the theatres , the man in the street came into contact with the creations of Elizabethan culture . The theatres themselves were primitive affairs , developed from the inn-yards in which traveling groups of actors had produced their embryonic plays . The drama became popular enough in London to require special buildings ; they were little more than enclosed roofless yards . Covered galleries ran along one side ; opposite was the stage , a platform protruding into the yard , with a balcony above and a room that could be screened off behind it . The open place between stage and galleries was known as the pit ; here the poorer members of the audience stood , exposed to the weather , to watch the play . Even under such conditions , playgoing became so popular that there were eleven theatres in and around London by the end of Elizabeth 's reign . And the audiences in those theatres were offered as entertainment the finest productions of the greatest Elizabethan playwrights , men like Shakespeare and Marlowe . If , as the legend goes , it was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comedy of The Merry Wives of Windsor , it // was before an audience of Londoners in a theatre such as we have described that the play was played . Side by side with drama , music was advancing . Amateur performance was popular ; in many homes songs and instru mental music enriched the life of the people ; and great composers like William Byrd fixed some of the musical spirit of the times in permanent form . Song and drama , important as they were , were but parts of the great literary production of Elizabethan England . Not only had polished models been imported from the Continent , particularly from Italy , but also two of the richest sources of inspiration had re cently been opened to Englishmen . The Reformation had put the English Bible into the hands of the people , and the Renaissance had revealed the inexhaustible treasures of Greek and Roman literature and art . Inspiration , sub jects , and forms all came together . And at the same time the language was in a state peculiarly favorable to literary composition . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is today ; or at any rate great poets dared to treat it as if it were free and flexible . Accents could still be shifted from syllable to syllable , as rhythm demanded ; single words could be used as several different parts of speech ; and in a world full of marvels and sur prises , no one objected to finding a familiar , vivid term in a strange , suggestive context . The men who worked with this language were not blind to its rare worth ; Shakespeare paid his tribute to it through the lips of Mowbray in Richard II . And they used the language to the utmost advantage in one imperishable crea tion after another . // But , after all , much of the credit for the work of these men ? dramatists , poets , essayists , romancers , historians , translators ? is due not to them but to the conditions under which they wrote , and to the great queen who helped create those conditions . Many of the writers of Elizabeth 's day we have already mentioned because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during her reign were affected by it ? among them Daniel and Peele ; Lyly , who was patronized by her minister Burleigh ; Greene , Lodge , and Nashe ; Drayton , whose great Agincourt celebrates the English nationalism of an earlier century ; Chapman , North , and Florio , who turned masterpieces of Greek , Roman , and French literature into English masterpieces . All of these added glory to the Elizabethan age ; each of them owes some greatness to his queen . The close contact between the literature of the nation and the center of national life undoubtedly helped to make that literature great . And literary greatness is only one of the many achievements of Elizabeth 's reign . A thrilling combination of circumstances brought everyday , commonplace business life into direct contact with the wildest sort of romance and adventure . Commerce and piracy , industry and exploration , scholarship and war , politics and literature , were constantly meeting and vitalizing each other . Out of these startling unions , great things were born . Not only by stimulating all these interests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of prosperity and security in which these interests could bear fruit , the queen did her share . She inspired and strengthened Englishmen , too , with a new loyalty , a new love , for England // and the queen , that went far beyond the old ties of Church , family , or political faction . And under the patronage of Elizabeth London tradesmen and South Sea adventurers rubbed elbows in the pit of the Globe Theatre , applauding the soliloquies of Hamlet . CHAPTER VII THE EARLY STUARTS ( 1603-1649 ) " But that two-handed engine at the door Stands ready to smite once and smite no more . " MILTON , Lycidas . When Elizabeth died , the heir to the English crown was her distant cousin , King James VI of Scotland , the son of Mary Queen of Scots and Darnley . With him began the feverish attempt of the Stuart family to rule as well as reign over the southern kingdom , an attempt that lasted all through the Seven teenth Century . James I was not temperamentally fit for his task . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstinate pedant , lacking in those glamorous qualities which had so endeared the Tudor monarchs to their subjects . Completely blind to his own learned ignorance of the English national temper , he immediately celebrated his arrival in England by the despotic hanging of a pickpocket without fair trial . Before inheriting the English crown , James had already announced his belief in the divine right of kings , claiming that his power was unlimited by any rights of his people , that he himself was not subject to the laws of his country , and that he derived his power from God alone and was responsible only to God . Hav ing become King James I of England , the monarch re-affirmed his divine right . He was surrounded by enemies : 119 // political enemies like Sir Walter Raleigh , who was thrown into the Tower for plotting ; and religious enemies . The Roman Catholics were trying to deprive him of his throne , and they almost succeeded in the infamous Gunpowder Plot ( in which Guy Fawkes played an important part ) . This was an attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the king and both Houses of Parliament . The Catholics justified themselves on the ground that the Pope was supreme over all kings . At the same time a strong Protestant party in the Anglican Church was eager to abolish bishops and set up the Presbyterian organization , which made the Church a power greater than the State . James 's insistence upon his own divine right was an answer to all such pretensions . The power which James claimed was in fact no greater than that which Elizabeth had exercised . But James was not Elizabeth ; he lacked the personal magic , the executive qualities , and the policies necessary to bend his subjects to his own will . The English people , after an era of prosperity , were no longer willing to purchase peace and order at the price of blind submission to a despot 's commands . The growth of their power abroad , and the development of independent traits and ideas , encouraged them to assert themselves at home ; they burned to take a hand in their own government , when a change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The national Parliament was in theory the agency by which the people could express their will . But actually that body represented only the upper classes , and was feared by the people before the Tudor times because of its // unlimited use of bills of attainder , which could destroy the life and property of a private citizen . The Tudors seized upon the unpopularity of Parliament , and gave the two Houses few opportunities to do anything . The Com mons and Lords could not be summoned to meet except by the sovereign 's command ; and they could be instantly dis missed by royal order . The nation had not yet recognized the principle that , in case of disagreement between king and Parliament , the latter was supreme . The House of Commons had not yet established its superiority over the Lords ; and the king 's ministers did not realize that they were responsible for their conduct primarily to Parliament . Most men still felt that the chief function of the legislative body was to vote taxes , to provide funds for the govern ment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief was voted could Parliament exert any independent power . Elizabeth , by strict economy , had managed to get along without much financial help from Parliament , and in this way had given the legislative body little chance to interfere with her rule . But when Elizabeth died , her government was deeply in debt and was still en-gaged in war with Spain . Her successor inherited a difficult financial problem . The best policy for James was to practice thrift , and , when necessary , to make concessions to Parliament in ex-change for the grant of subsidies , or funds for his use . But James could not practice thrift , and his theories regarding his own absolute power forbade his making concessions . The conflict between the king and his people was in122 THE EARLY STUARTS tensified by James 's extreme unpopularity , which was due to a number of causes . Stiff-necked English squires detested the king 's claim of divine right , as they detested his high-handed conduct . A liberty-loving people who had rejoiced for centuries in the protection of their own common law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the High Commission which James 's predecessors had set up and which he himself fostered as instruments of his personal tyranny . A powerful jurist , Coke , defended the common law so vigorously that James dismissed him from his office of Chief Justice ; Coke thereupon became one of the king 's most dangerous enemies in Parliament . James 's graceless personality added to his unpopularity ; his extravagance , though it rendered his court brilliant with pageants and masques , some of them written by Ben Jonson and designed by the great architect Inigo Jones , did not endear him to his people . He surrounded himself with worthless favorites whom the nation despised , chief among them the brilliant and unscrupulous George Villiers , Duke of Buckingham . Worst of all were James 's foreign policy and his attitude toward religious affairs . England felt that Spain was its hereditary enemy , yet the Stuart king beheaded Sir Walter Raleigh for attacking a Spanish colony , and tried to unite his own family by marriage to the Spanish rulers . At the same time he established a Protestant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruler , Frederick , the Elector Palatine . The wedding was a sumptuous affair , during which The Tempest , one of Shakespeare 's last plays , was // performed . From the marriage a daughter was born , through whom the House of Hanover eventually inherited the English throne . James 's son-in-law , Frederick , soon became involved in a struggle against the Catholic Emperor ; in order to win Spanish support for Frederick , James redoubled his efforts to secure a marriage alliance with Spain . But it was against the policy of Catholic Spain to war against the Catholic Emperor ; and the Spanish Infanta or princess , the sug gested bride , rejected the proposals of Prince Charles , the son and heir of the English king . Without English aid , Frederick was defeated and forced to flee to Holland . And James , having permitted a Protestant ruler to lose his possessions , became more unpopular than ever . The king 's handling of Irish affairs was as ill-advised as his European policy , and caused as much trouble to his successors if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gradually reducing the Irish people to some sort of order , James suddenly seized a large part of northern Ireland , and , evicting the residents , turned over the choicest lands to Scotch and English settlers . This " Plantation of Ulster , " in i611 , was the origin of the Prot estant Ulster that complicates the Irish situation today . With the vigorous spirit of reform in the Anglican Church James had no sympathy . Presbyterian sentiment was running higher and higher , and many reformers wished to abolish en-tirely the episcopal organization of bishops . But James had never forgotten the rough way that the Presbyterians in Scotland had treated his mother , and later him-self ; and he knew what valuable support the bishops gave // to his own throne . " No bishop , no king ! " he cried , and he threatened to harry the Puritan and Presbyterian reformers out of his kingdom . By encouraging the old-fashioned ob servance of Sunday with games , feasting , and fun , James caused especial pain to the stricter Puritans . Partly through such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Star Chamber and High Commission , the king persecuted the Puritans so severely that many of them were glad to flee to the barren shores of North America and participate in the settlement of New England . They were the second group of English settlers to go to the New World ; the first had settled Jamestown in 1607 with the approval of James I. James 's attitude toward the Church intensified the bad feeling between him and his people . He was unable to manage Parliament as he wished ; he could not get the two Houses to vote him the supplies he needed , nor could he quell their spirit of opposition . He attempted , therefore , to rule without summoning Parliament to meet . For seven years the legislative body was never once permitted to assemble , but the spirit of the legislators was not broken . At last a crisis in foreign affairs , due to the outbreak of the Thirty Years ' War on the Continent , forced James to summon Parliament . But Parliament , as soon as it met , demanded first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning its wrath against James 's corrupt Chancellor , Francis Bacon , revived the ancient process of impeachment and convicted him . King James did not long survive the downfall of his Chancellor , the collapse of his own plans for a marriage // alliance with Spain , and the pitiful failure of his only essay in war ? the Mansfeld expedition of the Thirty Years ' War . In 1623 the Spanish Infanta finally rejected Prince Charles , though he had come to Spain to plead his suit in person ; a year later Charles was formally pledged to a sister of the French king instead , and in 1625 James I died . He had been a poor king ; he had alienated his subjects ' affections from the Crown ; he had lowered his country 's prestige abroad ; he had built up a fatal spirit of opposition between the two great heads of the English state ? the king and the Parliament . With the exception of the great King James ' or Author-ized Version of the Bible , which appeared at his com-mand in 1611 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pageantry of his court was a mere after-glow of the splendors of the preceding reign . To his son Charles he left nothing vital and valuable ; he left only a nation agitated by religious , political , and financial dis-order , and meanly involved in the squabbles of Continental princes ; this , with an empty treasury and an overflowing measure of contempt and distrust , was Charles I ' , s inherit-ance . The new king , unfortunately , was not made of such stuff as strengthened him to cope with these problems . Handsome in appearance , cultured and pleasing in manner , so deeply religious that many adherents of his church have well-nigh canonized him , he lacked c , ) mpletely the Tudor gift of diagnosing and expressing the spirit of the nation . Instead , everything about Charles served only to deepen the distrust that the // people had felt for his father . Lacking in force and de cision , he permitted in his court folly and vice that antago nized the increasingly Puritanical temper of his subjects . His chief adviser was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whom most Englishmen hated . His queen , Henrietta Maria , was a Frenchwoman and a Roman Catholic ? a dangerous schemer whom no one could trust . Charles inherited , too , his father 's unpopular convictions regarding the divine right of kings . And he could not adjust himself to the national attitude toward religion . He himself adopted the High Anglican position ; that is , he favored elaborate ritual and ceremony in the church services ; and although he believed that the Church should be restored to its primi tive state before popish abuses crept in , he despised the Protestant innovations of Luther and Calvin . His eager ness to placate the Roman Catholic element in his court , his own fondness for religious ceremonial , his need for the support of a strong organization of bishops ? all these things determined his attitude . But the nation at large , outside the court , felt very differ ently . The highly formalized type of religion imposed by the bishops was distasteful to many earnest men ; it deterred John Milton from becoming a clergyman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strengthened by the newly available Authorized Version of the Bible . And the inevitable reaction against the free dom and delight of Elizabethan life had begun , in a wave of sternly sober sentiment . This same sobriety was ap parent in a number of opposing groups : the Puritans , who // wished merely to cleanse the Anglican Church from within ; the Presbyterians , who wanted to impose their own form of church government ; and the Independents ( also known as Separatists and Brownists , and surviving as Congrega-tionalists today ) , who advocated real toleration , and thought that each congregation should be left free to handle its own affairs . All these sects were united in their hatred of elaborate ceremony , and in their desire to make the Church independent of the State , if not supreme over it . Already Englishmen were grouping themselves in two parties , one of them composed of the king and his court , the powerful nobles , the country gentlemen of the north of England , the High Anglicans , and the Roman Catholics ; the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the religious reformers . The dividing line was nowhere clearly marked , but the conflict between the two parties was to grow sharper and sharper till it ended in civil war and the beheading of the king . Charles 's troubles with Parliament began in the first year of his reign . The legislators voted to the new king an insultingly inadequate appropriation , and then began to criticize his advisers , particularly Buckingham . Charles thereupon dissolved Parliament . But he was desperately in need of money , and the next year he summoned a new Parliament . It in turn postponed any grant of funds and began im-peaching Buckingham , whereupon Charles angrily dis-missed it . The king now tried to replenish his treasury by forcing his subjects to lend him money . The device of the forced loan was fairly successful , but it strengthened the spirit of revolt . // When Charles , still hoping for a grant of money , sum moned his third Parliament in 1628 , both Houses pre sented to him the famous Petition of Right , denouncing the forced loan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the billeting of soldiers in private homes . In order to pacify Parliament and get his grant , the king grudgingly assented to the petition . The murder of Buckingham in the same year removed one cause of friction , but another developed in the import duties which Charles levied without Parliamentary author ization . Against these the House of Commons objected ; when the baffled king sent his officers to dissolve Parlia ment , the excited legislators held the speaker down in his chair to prevent adjournment until they had passed three resolutions denouncing the king 's High Church inno vations and his import duties . Charles , thoroughly disgusted with Parliament , now ruled for eleven years without once summoning the Houses to meet . In order to get money , he was driven to the most desperate devices , which antagonized his subjects even further . The king 's counselors combed the legal records of the realm for precedents by which he could extract money from his subjects . He continued levy ing import duties ; he set up " Forest Courts " through which certain landholders could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deal in such necessaries as soap and beer ; he bargained in titles of nobility ; he forced moderately wealthy men to accept knighthood or pay a fine . The most galling imposition , however , was the levying of ship money . By an old custom , coast towns were obliged // to provide ships for national defense . Charles extended this obligation to the whole country , and permitted dwellers inland to fulfill it by the payment of money . One country squire , John Hampden , refused to pay the twenty shillings assessed against him . His was made a test case ; it was decided against him , by a bare majority of the judges . Ship money became one of the chief grievances against the king ; and Hampden was elevated to the position of popular hero ; he became one of the outstanding figures in the oppo sition to the king . In the meantime , the religious conflict had not languished . Charles had set up as Archbishop of Canterbury , head of the English Church , a man named Laud , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church views and was anxious to strengthen the bishops and revive ancient ceremonial . Laud and Charles were eager to impose the episcopal system upon the Scotch Presbyterians . As a step in this direction they attempted , in 1637 , to force the Scots to accept a new prayer book drawn up by Laud and full of High Anglicanism . The opposition in Scotland was violent ; the Scottish lead ers framed a new Covenant in which they swore to defend their own Church . Charles temporized until the spring of 1639 , in the meantime laying plans for a military invasion by which he could force his will upon the Scots . The Scots themselves were not idle , however ; they too pre-pared for war , and their preparations under generals trained in the army of Gustavus Adolphus were much more effective than Charles 's . The two armies at last came into contact in what is known as the First Bishops ' War . The war did not turn // out to be a very bloody one ; only one man was killed , and he by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make better preparations for a struggle . One of his first steps was the recall of an able adviser , Thomas Wentworth , who had been governing Ireland for six years , where his bold perseverance became famous as the policy of " Thor ough . " Wentworth on his return to England was created Earl of Strafford . Having learned to control the Irish Parliament , he recommended to Charles that the English Parliament be summoned to vote supplies for the Scotch War . Charles acquiesced ; and in 164o , after an interim of eleven years , Parliament met . But it met in the spirit of obstinate determination to assert its own rights . The session was opened by an old lover of liberty , John Pym ; following his lead the Commons prepared to present their complaints , and began negotiating with the Scots , whereupon Charles dissolved Parliament ; having lasted for only three weeks , it came to be known as the Short Parliament . Strafford now encouraged Charles in various illegal de-vices for procuring money . But these were not successful ; when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed the Border in the Second Bishops ' War , Charles could muster only a small , ill-equipped , untrained force to meet them . The king 's army was unable to prevent the Scotch from establishing themselves in northern England ; in the face of this emergency Charles was forced to summon Parliament again , and to conclude a truce with the enemy , who were to remain in // England at English expense until a definite peace treaty could be signed . When this new Parliament , known thereafter as the Long Parliament , met in November , 164o , the stage was set for an open break between the two great parties in the English nation . The Parliamentarians and religious reformers , under their leaders Hampden , Pym , and Oliver Cromwell ( Hampden 's cousin ) , realized that Strafford and Laud were the most powerful , the most dangerous men in the Royalist , High Anglican party . Against Strafford and Laud Parliament began the attack . Charles was helpless to aid his ministers , for in the face of the Scottish invasion he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protected itself by passing laws that it must meet at least once every three years and that it could not be dissolved without its own consent . The earl and the archbishop were both impeached ; Laud was thrown into the Tower , where he languished for four years before he was finally beheaded . Strafford was marked out for immediate execution , and the last chance of saving him vanished when Queen Henrietta Maria was discovered engaged in an " Army Plot " to bring the army down from the north to rescue him from Parliament . The earl was convicted and executed in May , 1641 . In the meantime , however , dissension was breaking out in Parliament . The members of the House of Commons represented different brands of church reform , and discord soon arose among Puritans , Presbyterians , and Independents . The Presbyterians , supported by able pamphleteers like John Milton ( who had returned from the Continent to engage in this very struggle ) , attacked the // bishops and wished to see them abolished " root and branch . " The more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king some support . Parliament was further distracted by a fearful uprising in Ireland , and by Charles 's plots to bring an army to London to enforce his will . Finally , in November , 1641 , Parliament passed and published a " Grand Remonstrance " on the state of the realm , which was really a statement of its case against Charles . The king , encouraged by the support of his own adherents , and angered by the insolence of his enemies , retaliated by trying to force the impeachment of his five most dangerous adversaries , including Pym and Hampden ; he even went in person , with an armed force at his back , to the sacred precincts of the Commons . But the five were spirited away , and the House of Commons defied its sovereign . Charles abandoned London and prepared for civil war . The members of Parliament immediately voted for an army to support them in the struggle , and went on to pass revolutionary and Puritan legislation . Among other things , they established a strict censorship of the press , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theatres by law ; for the radical reformers detested such entertainment , and the stage had always been closely connected with the court , had been suspected of nourishing vice and frivolity , and had constantly ridiculed the Puritan point of view . For eighteen years , from 1642 to 166o , it was illegal to present a play in England . In August , 1642 , open hostilities began . The Parliamentarians , or the Roundheads , as they came to be called // because of their close-cropped hair , were for a time at a disadvantage . There were disagreements in their own ranks ; and their general aims were not clear . They did not wish to kill the king or abolish monarchy ; they wanted rather to limit the king 's power , and to establish their own religious sects . Their military policy was dictated only by a desultory pur pose of controlling as much territory as possible . Many of their adherents and leaders were men of the middle and lower classes who had had no training in arms , and who , despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a successful game of war . Moreover , they had in the beginning no funds immediately available . But they were in possession of the ports and the sources of the income of the government . The Royalists or Cavaliers , on the other hand , were united by personal loyalty to the king . Their aim was to reestablish his supremacy by capturing London . Many of their leaders and soldiers were skilled in military tactics ; there was a dash and splendor in their manner , often in herited with their noble blood , that helped them time and again to save their losing cause . It is perhaps significant that most of the great poets and prose writers of the period , with the- notable exception of John Milton , were Cavalier in sympathy . There was a certain glamor about the royal cause and the royal Church that appealed to men 's imagi nations . At Edgehill , the first serious battle of the war , the Cavalier supremacy convinced one of the Roundhead leaders , Oliver Cromwell , that he would have to build up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // morale , before he could hope to hold his own . While desultory warfare continued , with no decisive results , Crom ' well combed the countryside for recruits fit to serve in his new regiment of cavalry . He selected stern , independent , God-fearing fellows , responsible men of some position , who were willing to submit themselves to his discipline . The success of Cromwell 's new regiment in the battle of Marston Moor , 1644 , made their leader one of the most important men in the Parliamentary party , for Pym and Hampden had both died in the previous year . At Marston Moor Cromwell was chiefly responsible for the Roundheads ' winning of the hard-fought battle ; the defeated Royalist leader , Prince Rupert , the king 's nephew , gave Cromwell the nickname of " Ironsides , " which was later applied to his regiment . Cromwell 's rise contributed greatly to the ultimate success of the popular party . Many men , like Milton , were learning that the intolerant Presbyterian spirit of Parliament was dangerous to the national welfare and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parliamentary control of the army interfered with military success , for one element in Parliament was constantly negotiating with Charles , and narrow Presbyterian standards hampered the development of the army ; in recruiting his own " Ironsides " he had gone outside the Presbyterian fold . He therefore persuaded Parliament to pass the New Model Ordinance providing for the creation of a whole army modeled after his " Ironsides , " and the Self-Denying Ordinance , which freed the army from Parliamentary control by making members of either House resign their miliSECOND // tary commissions . It was with the New Model army that the name " Redcoats , " and the Coldstream Guards and other famous regiments originated . The New Model army ( in which John Bunyan was a recruit ) , strongly Independent in its leanings , and com manded by Cromwell and a brilliant young officer named Fairfax , took the field against Charles and defeated him at Naseby in 1645 . Charles fled , hoping for aid from Montrose , his ally in the Scottish Highlands , or from re bellious Ireland . When no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Scotch in the spring of 1646 . Thus the First Civil War came to an end . With the cessation of open warfare against the Royalists , the army became more and more antagonistic to Parliament ( which still hoped to compromise with the king ) , and began at last to urge the complete abolition of monarchy . When the Scotch , in 1647 , turned Charles over to Parlia ment , the army kidnaped the king and marched to London to take charge of affairs , and to assert their liberty against the Presbyterians , who wanted to permit no other sects to exist . The king was constantly dickering with the Scots , with Parliament , and with the army , until it became apparent that no stable peace and freedom could ever be attained while he was free to plot . Just at the end of 1647 Charles signed an " Engagement " with the Scotch by which they were to restore him to his throne in return for certain concessions . As a result , the Scotch invaded England in 1648 , and scattered Royalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had begun . // This was the last straw . Cromwell defeated the Scotch and the Royalists in short order , and then turned his at tention to Parliament , which was still trying to come to terms with the king . In December , 1648 , a detachment of soldiers under Colonel Pride drove out of Parliament all the members hostile to the army . After this high-handed act , known as " Pride 's Purge , " the remnant of Parliament , the " Rump , " supported by the soldiers , prepared to execute justice upon the king . Charles was locked away in prison ; his supporters later claimed that he wrote there a book of royal devotions , a claim which called forth Milton 's Eikonoklastes in reply . The Rump Parliament erected a High Court of Justice , which proceeded to try King Charles I for treason . The king acted throughout the trial with quiet dignity . Only a week after the court first met he was convicted as an enemy of the Commonwealth of England , and condemned to die . Three days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was led forth onto the scaffold . Maintaining the innocence of his cause and protesting against the illegality of his sentence , he laid his head on the block . The ax fell . The feelings of the English and Continental ruling classes were unspeakably shocked by this act of a small minority . Charles 's last words were true ; his conviction was absolutely illegal . But something had to be done to prevent a man of his incredibly stubborn and underhand temperament from interfering with the army leaders ' plans to save England . Cromwell and his followers , in bringing about Charles 's execution , merely adopted the shortest , simplest method of clearing the way for their own rule . CHAPTER VIII THE REPUBLICAN EXPERIMENT ( 1649-r66o ) .. Much remains / To conquer still ; Peace hath her victories No less renowned than War ; new foes arise Threatening to bind our souls with secular chains . " MILTON , To the Lord General Cromwell . The story of the eleven years following the execution of Charles I is the story of a series of efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monarchy . By far the most important actor in this story was Oliver Cromwell . Cromwell had played perhaps as large a part as anyone in defeating the Royalist armies , and in bringing about Charles 's death . When England destroyed the Crown , Cromwell , the army , and the Rump Parliament were left as the three strongest agencies of government . The Rump was the first to assume control . It was no more than a misshapen fragment of the Long Parliament which had been summoned nine years before ; the majority of the original members , Presby terian or Royalist in sympathies and hostile to Cromwell and the army , had been expelled in Pride 's Purge . The remnant never in any sense spoke for the English people ; and it became less and less representative as the national spirit recoiled from the Regicides , the slayers of King Charles I. 137 // The Rump had no legal right to legislate for the nation . But it realized that it was in a position to save the country from a Royalist reaction , the tyranny of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And so the Rump prepared to carry on . Immediately after executing Charles it abol ished the monarchy and the House of Lords , declared England a Commonwealth ( the first national republic in history ) , and appointed a Council of State to manage the government . The poet John Milton was named Latin Secretary ; his duties were varied , including the writing of pamphlets to defend the republican government at home and abroad , and the composition of diplomatic letters to foreign potentates . Milton had for ten years been devoting himself to politics at the expense of his poetry , and that devotion was to last for ten years more . In fulfilling his new duties he so over-strained his eyes that he went blind , and he wrote prac tically no poetry except a few sonnets , in which he stated his own Independent contempt for Presbyterianism , praised certain republican leaders , and thrillingly denounced the massacre of Protestants in Piedmont . But when his adventure in statecraft ended , he returned to his earlier love , poetry , and in his blindness composed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mil-ton over all other writers of his day that tended to give the literature of the age a Puritanical cast . The refusal of the Puritan government to permit theatrical performances , the censorship laws , and the general disapproval of pleasure emphasized this note of Puritanism . There was in fact a marked increase in religious spirit , // a higher seriousness , a deepened dignity in the literature of the mid-Seventeenth Century . But the Puritans were far from being solely responsible for this change ; as a matter of fact very few of the important writers of the day were Puritans , with the exception of Milton and his friend and political colleague Andrew Marvell . By far the greater number of the writers contemporary with Oliver Cromwell were Anglicans ; and a few showed a marked tendency even further away from Puritanism and toward the persecuted Roman Catholic Church . Two of the greatest prose writers , Jeremy Taylor and Thomas Fuller , were Anglican clergymen ; and two others , Izaak Walton and Sir Thomas Browne , were staunch lay members of the same sect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holy orders , and Vaughan and Crashaw both tended toward Roman Catholicism ? Crashaw so strongly that he became a convert . The Anglican Church had been upheld by the martyred Charles I ; Anglicanism was the religion of the Royalist party ; and a number of brilliant writers were to be found among the Royalists and courtiers , the Cavaliers . Jeremy Taylor , who had been a chaplain in Charles 's army , was deprived of his office by the Puritan government ; the poet Carew , who had died before the Civil Wars , had been a courtier of Charles , and Lovelace and Suckling carried on the tradition of Cavalier poetry after him ; Waller and Denham were both Royalists in sympathy . Among these writers the free vigorous spirit of Elizabeth 's reign survived ; and the Renaissance humanism , the delight in man and his works which had glorified the later // Tudor courts , still lingered in them , and even in Milton , particularly in his earlier , gayer poems . Oliver Cromwell , the greatest soldier and statesman of the Commonwealth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verses written by more than one poet ; and in temperament he was far from being a dour enemy of art and joy . No one relished vigorous horseplay , or delighted in sport more keenly than this leader of " Ironsides . " But circumstances placed him in a situation where he had little chance to indulge such tastes . Cromwell believed in religious toleration ; he permitted the Jews , exiled for centuries , to return to England ; and in an age when few men conceived of permitting any Church save their own to exist , he wished to allow everyone to worship as his conscience dictated , within reasonable limits . When he was in a position of authority , he exer cised little control over the Church , except in his efforts to cleanse it of base and ignorant clergymen . Cromwell believed also in a liberal government with the people 's welfare as its prime concern ; but chaotic conditions forced him into despotism , by which he hoped to protect the people from their own insane desires , and to give them what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man placed in a responsible position in those distracted times , Cromwell was an opportunist , ready to take advantage of every situation that chance presented . And the solid foundation of practical sense that underlay his passionate religious enthusiasm helped him to save the State from dissolution during the years when England was without a king . His military genius , too , was phenomeOPPOSITION // nal ; had European politics permitted , he might have won for himself a name like Alexander 's or Napoleon 's . As a statesman he has been criticized because he failed to detect the menace in the rising power of France , and aided the French against an already decadent Spain . His de-tractors point , too , to the early fall of the government which he established . But we must remember that he did , after all , establish a government out of chaos ; and that he foresaw England 's future needs as a colonial empire when he contemplated taking and holding Gibraltar as an English outpost . Cromwell 's ideal of a powerful , free , tolerant republic was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , but also because many forces and circumstances opposed it . When Charles was beheaded , he left a nation torn by civil war and financially demoralized . Rival political and religious factions were at each other 's throats , and the con-fused state of public opinion made a direct appeal to the voters impossible . Presbyterians , Anglicans , Royalists , and Parliamentarians , all struggling and intriguing together , were all opposed to the grotesque relic of Parliament , the Rump . When the Independent Rump began its constructive work by appointing a Council of State to administer the government , it found itself opposed by two extreme fac-tions : the ultra-radical element in the army , known as Levellers ; and the large body of Royalist sympathizers ? Roman Catholics , Anglicans , and Presbyterians , who re-sented their expulsion in Pride 's Purge , and recoiled from king-murder. // Cromwell , practically supreme in the army , stifled the Levellers there ; and had the liberalized army take the place of the intolerant Rump as the head of the State . He then set out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotland had both declared for Charles 's son and acknowledged him as King Charles II . To Ire-land Cromwell ( as commander-in-chief ) led an army . By brilliant battle and savage massacre he reduced the neigh-boring island to such a state that the terrible tradition of his campaign still lingers there . And the Rump was able to carry out its policy of suppressing Catholicism and allotting the lands of expelled natives to Commonwealth soldiers . Cromwell hastened to Scotland , where Prince Charles had taken refuge and had gained Scottish support by sub-scribing to the Covenant of Presbyterianism . Cornered by the armies of the Commonwealth , Charles was forced to retreat into England ; the battle of Worcester , in 1651 , destroyed his power ; and only after weeks of romantic adventure was the prince himself able to escape to the Continent . In the meantime a brilliant naval leader , Blake , was sweeping the Royalist ships from the seas and building up the Commonwealth navy . The new English State was growing stronger ; and the new English statesmen saw the necessity of establishing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn back in horror from the regicide government . Among these nations was the Netherlands . A Dutch prince was connected by marriage to the exiled Stuarts ; and Holland and England had already come to blows through commercial rivalry in // the East Indies , as well as through contested fishery rights in the North Sea . In 1651 the Rump struck a blow at the Dutch by passing a Navigation Act barring foreign ships from free trade in English ports ; and in the following year war broke out . After suffering some reverses the Common-wealth navy under Blake finally defeated the great Dutch Admiral Van Tromp . Cromwell , unlike his predecessor , could get from Parliament money to wage war . Having got the money , he spent it ; his yearly expenditures were triple those of Charles I , and he was rapidly doubling the national debt . But the Lord Protector ( for Cromwell had by this time assumed that despotic title ) regretted the expense of the Dutch war , and he deplored the resultant interference with English trade ; in 1654 he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and throughout the negotia tions he put commercial ends first , winning decided ad-vantages for English shipping . In the same year , hostilities broke out against the Spanish , who refused to grant freedom of religion or free dom of trade to the English . Cromwell allied himself with the French ; and when the war finally ended , several years later , England kept the Channel port of Dunkirk as a prize . All during these years Cromwell was experiencing diffi culty in governing England . The Rump legislators , having established the Commonwealth , promised in 1651 that they would go out of office in three years . But power was too sweet , and the Rump began planning to perpetuate itself by selecting its own new mem bers . For Cromwell , impatient with Parliament 's auto144 THE REPUBLICAN EXPERIMENT cratic inefficiency , this was too much to be borne . At the head of a band of soldiers he drove the Rump away ; and immediately thereafter , in 1653 , the army set up a provisional council with Cromwell at its head . The new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Independent clergymen . This assembly , known variously and derisively as the Nominated , Little , or Barebones Parliament , proved to be too radical and visionary for efficiency ; Cromwell 's own adherents among the members finally brought about a dissolution . The next experiment was a written constitution proposed by the army . This " Instrument of Government , " the first modern written constitution and the only written constitution by which England was ever governed , established a protectorate and gave Cromwell supreme power as Lord Protector for life . Under the Instrument Cromwell summoned the first Protectorate Parliament in 1654 . Unfortunately many of the members turned out to be so dissatisfied with the Instrument that they had to be expelled from the House , and when the remainder in turn began tampering with the constitution , Cromwell was forced to dismiss them in 1655 . Cromwell now wielded a power more absolute than Charles I had ever dreamed of ; circumstances had made a despot of the people 's champion . Royalist disturbances forced the Protector to divide the country into ten military districts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maintain peace and enforce the Puritan code . By // this means order was preserved ; the distaste of the people for army and Puritan rule was also aggravated . In 1656 , needing money for the Spanish war , Crom well called a second Protectorate Parliament , from which his opponents were excluded . The reaction against the army and towards monarchy was growing stronger ; the rule of the Major Generals was discontinued , and in 1657 Parliament offered Cromwell the kingly crown . For rea sons best known to himself , the man who might have been King Oliver I refused ; he accepted instead the title of Hereditary Protector , king in all but name . A second House , a potential House of Lords , was reestablished ; but intrigues and opposition grew stronger than ever , until in 1658 the Protector was forced to dissolve this Parliament too . A few months later , worn out by labor , illness , and personal grief , Oliver Cromwell died . His son , Richard Cromwell , a pleasant country squire , succeeded him as Hereditary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he was powerless to make any effective moves ; he was no man to withstand the growing spirit of discontent , or to block the series of swift steps that were to take England back to Stuart monarchy . His first Parliament survived only a few months and accomplished nothing ; when it was dissolved , the old Rump , expelled six years previously , was recalled , Richard 's services were no longer needed , his own sense of humor was too keen to permit him to retain an office in which he was uncomfortable , and he was allowed to go into peaceful retirement . The army , still greedy for power , found the Rump legislators as hard to deal with // as ever ; during their years out of office they had not learned the lesson that the exiled Prince Charles Stuart was learning ? that half a loaf is better than no bread . At the end of 1659 after a temporary dissolution the Rump was again recalled , and the time was now ripe for England to retrace the last steps back to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arisen to hasten the process . General Monck , an efficient soldier who had had long experience in fighting under England 's various rulers during the preceding twenty years , was at this time in command of the army in Scotland . Feeling that the nation was ready to return from army rule to the rule of law , he led his soldiers south to London to enforce the change . His first step was to readmit to the Rump those mem-bers who had been expelled in Pride 's Purge eleven years previously . The Long Parliament of 164o was thus re-vived ; by its own ruling , only the Long Parliament could bring the Long Parliament to an end ; so , with much re-sentment , it proceeded to dissolve itself , first providing for the summoning of a new " Convention " Parliament . The republican government had collapsed as a result of eco-nomic discontent , dissension among the supporters of the Commonwealth , and the inherent desire of the English people for a king . The way was at last clear for the restoration of a Stuart monarch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wisely counseled by his adviser Hyde ( later Earl of Clarendon ) the Stuart prince issued the Declaration of Breda , in which he offered amnesty , liberty , security and remunerEND // anon to everybody , leaving the details to Parliament . This was all that was needed ; the Convention met , and a month later , on May 25 , 166o , Charles II , having been proclaimed king , landed in Dover , home from his travels at last . England 's noble twenty years ' experiment in civil war and republican government had finally collapsed . But the attempt was not completely fruitless , and even in its collapse it left permanent marks upon the English nation . For one thing , army rule and Puritan rule were permanently discredited . So also was regal tyranny ; the fundamental necessity of government by law was established . Englishmen had learned that neither the Church nor the Crown could divorce itself from Parliament and rule alone . The conception of tolerance , the grand ideal of the great Protector 's heart , had at last penetrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never to be as intolerant as Puritanism , or as the earlier church of Laud . The many sects which Cromwell permitted to thrive were the source from which sprang the healthy non-conformity and dissent of later days . And the republican government , on its death bed , permitted the restoration of the Stuart kings , the establishment of the modern English monarchy .

" DRYDEN , Absalom and Achitophel . On May 25 , 166o , as Samuel Pepys tells us in his diary , Charles II landed in Dover .

The 166o " Convention " Parliament was a freely elected body , consisting of moderate Presbyterian Roundheads with a strong admixture of Cavaliers . Active Royalists , " Malignants , " as they were called , were not permitted to sit in the new assembly , although they had a voice in the election of members . The principles on which this Parliament created Charles 149 // II king of England were not perfect ; the legislative and executive arms of the government were still rivals and had not learned to work together for the national good ; the king 's ministers had not yet discovered that they were servants of the people , dependent on the House of Com mons and responsible to it for their conduct . And even the imperfect 166o principles of a tolerant and limited monarchy were not to be maintained without a struggle ; a reaction toward absolutism and intolerance followed the Restoration . But in 1688 a bloodless revolution overthrew James II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 166o as fundamental in the unwritten Constitution of England . Superficially English society underwent a great change when the Stuarts returned to the royal palace of Whitehall . Puritan sober-seriousness went out of style , and the neglected cult of pleasure became the chief business of the court . The theatres , closed by Parlia ment eighteen years before , were reopened in 166o when two playhouses were licensed , one under the patronage of James , Duke of York ( Charles 's brother and heir ) , the other under the king himself . In the dramatic revival that followed , bombastic rimed tragedies and brutal , brilliant comedies occupied the stage . Shakespeare 's profound knowledge of the human soul did not appeal to a generation that admired the heartless cynicism of Wycherley ; Shakes peare 's free play of imagination seemed grotesque to an audience brought up on classical French drama . As a re sult , the works of our greatest playwright were ignored , or remodeled to suit the new fashions . Interest in non-dramatic literature as well as in the // theatre flourished in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevalent system of literary patronage ; Seventeenth Century writers made their greatest profits not out of the sale of their published works and of testimonial advertisements , but from the gifts of rich and influential patrons . An author who dedicated his work to a prominent nobleman or politician might expect a substantial gift or a profitable government position in return . Under such circumstances it is easy to understand why the poet Dryden in 1658 lamented the death of Oliver Cromwell , and in 166o fervidly hailed the bright-starred return of Charles II . It was this same Dryden who , having lost court favor a generation later , began the attack on the system of patronage when he published by popular subscription his great translation of Vergil ; the last shot in the battle was not fired until after the middle of the next century , when Dr. Samuel Johnson spurned the interest of Lord Chesterfield in his Dictionary . The Restoration courtiers were interested in literature not only as patrons but also as writers . At the suggestion of the king himself , some of his nobles assisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heroic play ; and George Villiers , Duke of Buckingham , in his brilliant Rehearsal satirized this same type . The court had other serious interests beside literature . Purcell , the greatest of English composers and the writer of England 's first opera , Dido and zEneas , was organist of Charles 's royal chapel . Boyle 's Law in physics we owe to the brother of one of the court nobles who originated the heroic play . The king , whose mind was sparkling and eager , though ill-trained , encouraged scientific investigation . // The Royal Society , founded for this purpose in 1645 , was reestablished under Charles II 's patronage ; it carried on the tradition of inductive experiment for which Sir Francis Bacon , the great philosopher and essayist of the previous age , had given his life ; Bacon had died of a cold contracted when he stuffed a dead chicken with snow as an experiment in refrigeration . Of the Royal Society Pepys was at one time president ; its greatest member during the Stuart era was Sir Isaac Newton , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolved light into its seven primary colors ? Newton , on whose moonlit statue the youthful poet Wordsworth gazed , a century later : " ... Newton with his prism and silent face , The marble index of a mind for ever Voyaging through strange seas of thought , alone . " There is , however , a darker side to the picture of Restoration society . Behind the splendid pageantry and the glittering wit , behind the boisterous merry making and the brilliant intellectualism , lay moral chaos . The intense vitality and the vigorous imaginative and spiritual life of the Elizabethan age were dead . Self-interest , exhibited in calculated lust , greed , and cruelty , was the courtiers ' code of the day . Even though the picture of contemporary life presented in Restoration comedy is doubtless overdrawn , the reality was shocking enough . The Duke of Buckingham , for instance , the " Zimri " of Dryden 's Absalom and Achitophel , seduced Lady Shrewsbury and then killed her husband in a duel , while the lady , disguised as a page , held her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where such things occurred , Puritanism was // a jest . Samuel Butler put the jest in verse when he mocked the Puritans in Hudibras . But Puritanism still lived as a vital element in national life ; our so-called " Blue Laws " of today are a lingering evidence of this fact . The Puritan churches survived , and their spirit permeated the restored Anglican Church . And two of the noblest literary ex pressions of Puritanism date from Charles II 's reign ? Milton 's Paradise Lost and Bunyan 's Pilgrim 's Progress , one written by an aged and blinded relic of the Common-wealth , the other by a Baptist tinker imprisoned for un licensed preaching . Such writing , however , was not popular at court ; and on the writers there shone no rays of the king 's favor . Charles II had no interest in Biblical epics and religious alle gories ; and Charles directed or expressed the tastes of Restoration society . If Charles 's great ally , the French King Louis KIV , was the State , Charles himself was the Court . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like many of his Royalist followers , had spent ten years in France . There he had learned to love the polished splendor of French culture ; there he had developed his natural love of pleasure , his natural moral insensibility . Tall , charming , fond of exer cise and sport , Charles made an art of self-indulgence . " He delighted in a bewitching kind of pleasure called sauntering . " The king set the standard for his court 's debauchery ; his many mistresses included the famous Lady Castlemaine and the actress Nell Gwyn . These ladies were rewarded by having their royal offspring elevated to the peerage ; the rebellious Duke of Monmouth , Charles 's // illegitimate son , was the product of an early amour ; the Dukes of St. Albans sprang from Nell Gwyn ; and the ducal houses of Grafton , Richmond , and Buccleugh had a similar origin . However , Charles 's easy-going nature , combined with a sense of humor , had its advantages ; in an age of fierce animosities it helped him to steer a middle course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to bide his own time patiently . Like the pine tree , he could always bend and bow down before the prevailing wishes of his subjects . But he never broke . It was Charles , at heart a Roman Catholic , who first allowed the Jews , admitted into England by Cromwell , to open a synagogue in London , and who , after intriguing with the Catholics for two decades , cheerfully gave up all hope of reestablishing Catholicism as the national religion . This indolent , pleasure-loving disposition of the king served as a perfect mask for his ceaseless plots and intrigues . Charles II was in fact one of the most brilliant examples of unprincipled ability that England has ever seen . In one way he surpassed even Queen Elizabeth ; she deluded her statesmen by mystifying them , but rarely did Charles even arouse the suspicions of his . The central motive in Charles 's policy was his determination to keep his crown and his head , or , as he quaintly put it , " not to go on his travels again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his mind , and he never forgot it . His methods of effecting his aim were two ? to avoid the mistakes of illegal taxation and religious stubbornness that had ruined his father , and to buttress his regal position as strongly as possible with foreign and // with ecclesiastical support . With luck , with his own very amenable disposition , and with the secret help of Louis XIV , Charles accomplished his purpose by the first of these methods ; after Charles 's death , an over-emphasis on the last method cost James II his crown . The Convention Parliament of 166o which recalled Charles was in general sensible and moderate in its steps to restore order . Of course it made some mistakes , notably in reenacting the Navigation Act , which placed for eign shipping at a disadvantage , and antagonized the Dutch , and also the Scotch and Irish ; the political union with Scot-land and Ireland was dissolved , and these two became separate states subject to the English king . But the estab lished standing army , which had played an outstanding part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the nostrils of all Englishmen , was paid and practically disbanded ; only a few regiments survived for foreign service , and Charles was permitted to keep one , the magnificent Life Guards , for personal protection against fanatical " Fifth Monarchy Men , " who wanted to assist the second coming of Christ by violent methods . The navy , which had won great glory for the Commonwealth , was retained ; James , Duke of York , was made Lord Admiral , and Samuel Pepys did efficient service as Secretary of the Navy . In taking vengeance on the defeated republicans the Restoration government was exceedingly mild ; there was very little bloodshed , only thirteen regicides being executed . The Crown signified its willingness to let bygones be by gones , and an attempt was made to heal the wounds of civil // war by an Act of Indemnity and Oblivion , which restored confiscated lands to their owners , but permitted new pur-chasers to retain property which they had bought at private sales from impoverished Royalists . One effect of the Restoration was to give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Although agriculture suffered a severe setback , due among other causes to the unsettled ownership of land , England was still a predomi-nantly rural state . Aside from London with its half-million inhabitants there were only four towns whose population exceeded ten thousand . Royalist gentlemen who returned to their old country estates , and Common-wealth men who held their new ones , owned a considerable portion of English land and constituted the most influential class in rural society . When the Restoration government appointed these men Justices of the Peace , and put them in charge of their local militia , the gentry came to occupy dis-tinguished positions in their districts . These petty poten-tates , conservative , hearty lovers of the land , were destined to play a significant part in national politics , and to con-tribute to literature characters such as Squire Western and Mr. Allworthy in Fielding 's Tom Jones . Shortly after the Restoration , the Convention Parliament came to an end . Its successor , the so-called " Cavalier " Parliament , destined to survive until 1679 , was distinctly reactionary in tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who resented the loss of their lands , and the lingering vestiges of republican power . These Cavaliers began their session by taking Communion according to the Anglican forms ; // they then commanded the common hangman to burn the Solemn Covenant of the Presbyterians , and set out to undo all the constructive work of the Puritan government . They were strengthened in their loyalty to Charles II by a new doctrine of passive obedience to the Crown , based not on the theory of divine right but on the principle of Hobbes 's Leviathan , which maintained that all subjects , by an implied contract with their ruler , turned over their individual rights to him . The Cavaliers in the new Parliament found the Act of Indemnity and Oblivion so distasteful because of its moderate tone that they called it the " Act of indemnity to the king 's enemies and oblivion to his friends . " Their attempt to repeal it failed ; but Parliament proceeded to pass a series of four acts destined to reduce the large Presbyterian element in the nation to an unimportant place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been weakened in the course of the events that brought about the fall of the Protectorate . The four acts were known as the Clarendon Code ; Clarendon , the adviser of Charles II and the father of Anne Hyde , James 's first wife , was Lord Chancellor when they were passed . They established Anglicanism as the national church , forbade all other forms of public worship , and excluded from political , educational , and ecclesiastical activity all men who refused to conform to the state religion . A fifth of the clergymen in England , however , refused to yield to the newly reestablished Anglican Church and were ousted . Split up among many Protestant sects like the Baptists , Quakers , and Presbyterians , they made up with // their followers a large opposition body , roughly classified as Nonconformists or Dissenters , which has kept up re ligious competition in England during the two and a half centuries that Anglicanism has remained the state religion . In addition , there developed a split in the Established Church itself , which formed two parties , Low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latitudinarians , believed in a broad tolerant church , opposed the absolute power of the king , and loosely associated themselves with the political standards of the urban middle classes , and of the political party that came to be called Whig . The High Churchmen favored a church strict in creed and organization , supported the royal supremacy , and allied themselves with the courtiers and the Tory party in politics . Just at the time when the Cavalier Parliament completed its attempt to settle the religious problems of the nation , two great blows fell upon England . London was then as now the center of national life ? London with its immense and crowded popu lation , its narrow medieval streets , its quaint and beautiful buildings , its rich shipping and varied industries , ? London with its disreputable district , Whitefriars ; its ancient cathedral where men met in " Paul 's Walk " for business and pleasure ; its royal palace , Whitehall . And on London in 1665 descended for the last time the great plague . Thou-sands died in the streets , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the country to escape contamination . In Defoe 's pretended journal of the plague year , written half a century later , we have a vivid if imaginative picture of the grotesque and horrible circum stances of the epidemic . // A year later the second blow fell ; a great fire swept the city . Pepys in his diary gives us a first-hand account of this catastrophe ; Dryden 's Annus Mirabilis treats the same subject in verse . But the fire was not without its beneficent effects ; it wiped out the foul airless slums where plagues had bred ; and in the rebuilding of the city , streets were widened and straightened . One of the great est of English architects , Sir Christopher Wren , made a permanent contribution to the city 's beauty when he super-intended the rebuilding of Saint Paul 's Cathedral and of some fifty parish churches . But the great fire was not the only circumstance that led Dryden to call 1666 the " Wonderful Year . " England was for a second time involved in a naval war with the Dutch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New Amsterdam and given it to James , Duke of York , rechristening it New York . The war reached its climax when the Dutch fleet sailed up the Thames itself and set fire to the English shipping . A temporary peace was established in 1667 ; but five years later a third round in the series of Dutch wars was fought . The English and the Dutch were fundamentally sympa thetic in their Protestantism and in their fear of French aggression ; commercial rivalry was the chief cause of the recurring friction between them . But the English king Charles II was at heart neither Protestant nor anti-French . The secret aim of his foreign policy was to strengthen his own throne by reestablishing the Roman Catholic Church in England and by securing French support . Fortunately // for Charles , a peculiar situation in European politics made his help invaluable to the French king . France was at this time governed by the great Louis XIV , the Grand Monarch , the Sun King . This ruler was anxious to carry on the expansive policies of two great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope was to take advantage of the languishing power of Spain and to extend his own borders to the Alps and the Pyrenees . The first step in Louis 's plan involved the conquest of the Spanish possessions ( roughly , modern Belgium and Luxemburg ) in the Netherlands , to which Louis had some slight claim through his Spanish wife . The French king was immensely powerful ; he had an income double that of Charles II , and he could put an army of two hundred thousand men in the field . But even with such a force he hesitated to embark on an imperialistic policy which would drive England into war against him . He decided therefore to bribe Charles into keeping England neutral . Charles was left with a very difficult hand to play . He was naturally sympathetic toward the French , having spent much of his youth in exile among them . Moreover he was bound to France by his marriage to the barren Catharine of Braganza , whose family were French allies . He was eager for Louis 's Roman Catholic help , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people were naturally hostile to France , a state that was stamping out the French Protestants , the Huguenots . They hated to see this aggressive foreign power establish itself in the Netherlands , just across the Channel ; similarly in 1914 England feared and hated the German aggressions in Belgium . // The free Dutch states ( corresponding to the modern Holland ) , next door to the contested Spanish Netherlands , likewise resented Louis 's dangerous advance ; the English and Dutch were logical allies against France . Fortunately for Charles 's personal designs , however , commercial rivalry kept England and Holland antagonistic to each other ; it was Holland that still prevented England from being the undisputed mistress of the seas . Even though a brilliant English diplomat , Sir William Temple ( the recipient of Dorothy Osborne 's delightful love letters ) , engineered a great Triple Alliance of England , Holland , and Sweden against France , Charles was able to support Louis . In 167o he signed a secret Treaty of Dover ( sealed by his acceptance of a new French mistress ) by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give aid against the Dutch ; he masked this agreement behind a sham treaty which said nothing about religion ; he left the Dutch at Louis 's mercy when the French attacked them . Only the heroism of the Dutch defenders , who cut the dykes and let in the ocean upon their low-lying country , drowning out the invader , saved them from French conquest . And when Charles at last discovered that he could not hope to drive his subjects back into the Roman Church , he cheerfully abandoned that aim and went on accepting French bribes as the price of English neutrality . In his attitude toward domestic affairs , as in his foreign relations , the king 's sympathy for Roman Catholicism was an important element . Clarendon , after seven years ' faithful service as chief adviser to Charles , was dismissed in 1667 , partially because he could not get on with Parliament , // which blamed him not only for the Dutch war but for the plague and the great fire ! His place was taken by an intimate council of five members , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of its secret nature , was known as the " Cabal " ; incidentally , the initials of its members happened to spell the same word . Charles at this time still hoped to restore Roman Catholicism . The intolerant provisions of the Clarendon Code had penalized Catholics as well as Protestant Dis senters ; Charles now had the brilliant idea of winning the Dissenters ' hearts at the same time that he favored the Catholics by issuing a Declaration of Indulgence , relieving all nonconformers ? Catholics as well as Dissenters ? from punishment . Against this Popish menace the Cavalier Parliament , con servative and Anglican in its temper , raised such objections that Charles withdrew his Declaration . Not yet satisfied , Parliament passed the famous Test Act , which required all office holders to take Communion in the Anglican Church and to disavow the Romish doctrine of transubstantiation . Of course some hypocritical nonconformists kept their offices by submitting to the letter of the law ? " occasional con formity , " this came to be called ? but all conscientious Dis senters and Catholics were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shaftesbury , a member of the Cabal , had supported the Test Act ; as a result he was dismissed from office , and the Cabal fell . Shaftesbury , a brilliant , unscrupulous politician , " a fiery soul ... a daring pilot in extremity , " not having been told of the Treaty of Dover , a measure of which he disapproved , // went over to the opposition ; he collected the tolerant , anticourt , middle-class factions iri national politics into a loose " Country Party , " the members of which later came to be known as " Whigs , " a slang term for Scotch Covenanters ; the Liberal party in Twentieth Century English politics is descended from the Whigs . Although there had been political factions and opposing groups before this time , there had been no system of established political parties like our own Republicans and Democrats . The party system in England had its first beginnings in Shaftesbury 's day ; he also introduced the custom of making an election a real event with bonfires and horseplay , thereby arousing the popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government . Shaftesbury 's activities against the Crown finally won for him the bad eminence which Dryden ascribed to him in the character of Achitophel . When the Cabal fell , the king at once called upon Danby , his new chief adviser , to set about building up a loyal political party made up of courtiers and High Churchmen , to counteract Shaftesbury 's Whigs ; this second party ( known as Conservative today ) came to be called Tory , a term originally applied to Irish outlaws . Danby also organized a magnificent system of political bribery , which helped him to keep Parliament fairly subservient to the Crown ; it had not yet occurred to the minister that he himself was primarily the servant of Parliament rather than of the king , though Parliament impressed this fact upon him a few years later when it impeached him despite his plea that he had obeyed royal orders . The conflict between the political parties , and the wide164 RESTORATION AND REVOLUTION spread fear of Catholicism and royal absolutism , kept the nation in such a state of unrest that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These meeting places for en tertainment and gossip had been introduced only recently , but they proved so popular that three thousand were in existence by the end of the century . At this time , when the new " flying coach " had just established the record of thirteen hours for the fifty-four mile trip between London and Oxford , when baggage had to be transported by pack horses on the back roads , and highwaymen preyed upon travelers , news was transmitted very slowly , and such news-papers as there were had only a limited circulation . The centers of political discussion were the coffee-houses , where men dropped in to drink , chat , write letters , play cards , and carry on business . And so popular were these informal clubs that the king was forced to revoke his order closing them . The agitation against Catholics continued ; there was indeed new cause for worry . Charles II had fathered many illegitimate children , but his queen remained barren . The heir to the throne was therefore the king 's brother , James Stuart , Duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had died , leaving him two Protestant daughters , Mary and Anne . James thereupon married the Catholic Mary of Modena , and two years later , in 1676 , openly professed his own adherence to the Roman Church . Although the fear of a Catholic succession was somewhat relieved by the marriage of his heir , his Protestant daughter Mary , to her Protestant cousin William of Orange , the young and able ruler of the Dutch states , there remained the possibility // that a Catholic male heir might be born from James 's second marriage . Just at this time the disclosure of the notorious Popish Plot added new fuel to the fire . Titus Oates , a vicious scoundrel , announced that he had discovered a plot of the Catholics to reestablish their Church in England by stirring up an Irish Catholic rebellion , murdering the king , burning London again ( some had blamed the Catholics for the great fire of 1666 ) , and setting the Duke of York on the throne . At the same time it was discovered that Coleman , the Duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French Jesuits , an aggressive Roman Catholic society . The discovery of the plot , most of which originated on the false tongue of Titus Oates , threw England into a panic . The mysterious murder of Godfrey , the magistrate in whose hands Oates 's charges had been placed , added to the terror . And the clever Shaftesbury saw in this situa tion a chance to vent his spleen against the court party and the royal family . Exaggerating the danger , he surrounded himself with a bodyguard of Whig thugs , his " brisk boys , " who bullied all men suspected of Catholic sympathies . London was in a state of ferment ; no one knew when or where the Jesuit " fire-balls " would fall , and shop keepers sold " Protestant flails " with which the citizens might pro tect themselves from the enemy . In the face of this crisis the Cavalier Parliament became suspicious of the king himself . This Parliament had now been sitting for sixteen years ; gradual changes in its mem bership had decreased the loyal Cavalier spirit , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax measures // should originate with them and not be altered by the Lords . Charles was compelled to disband a standing army which he had raised , and the Test Act was stiffened . The king attempted to maintain a neutral position in the struggle , but unfortunately his ambassador to France , Edward Montagu , chose this moment to reveal the secret intercourse between Louis XIV and Charles . Danby was incriminated by the disclosure , and Parliament immediately started to impeach him , turning a deaf ear to his plea that he had acted merely in obedience to the king . Seeing no other way to save his minister , Charles dissolved the Cavalier Parliament . When a new Parliament met , it continued the impeachment and put Danby in the tower . Then , imbued with a strong love of freedom , it passed the Habeas Corpus Act , protecting the personal liberty of the individual citizen . The Whig opposition now centered its attack on the Duke of York by presenting an Exclusion Bill , which would keep him from the throne . A more moderate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James 's powers in the event he became king ; finally in order to protect his brother 's right to the succession , Charles was forced to adjourn Parliament . Immediately the Whigs flooded him with petitions to reopen the session . Against these " Petitioners " the Tories ranged themselves as " Abhorrers " of the petitions . In the meantime the ghastly persecution of the Catholics , which had led to many executions , was beginning to wane . The Whigs had over-played their hand , and a reaction was setting in . When Parliament met again in i68o , although there was still enough anti-Popish spirit to burn the Pope // in effigy , the executions ended , and the House of Lords defeated a second Exclusion Bill . Charles , however , was unable to get the Whig opposition to accept his bill permitting James to succeed with limited powers ; he therefore dissolved Parliament , and summoned a new Parliament to assemble in Oxford , not daring to permit a meeting in London , a Whig stronghold . But the Oxford Parliament proved even more intractable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remain ing four years of his reign Charles governed without a Parliament ; he was enabled to do so by the continued grants of French money which rendered him independent . Shaftesbury , balked in his other schemes , now pretended that Charles 's illegitimate son , the Duke of Monmouth , was in fact the fruit of a secret marriage , and the legitimate heir to the throne . But the king , who favored the Duke of York , was at last in a position to strike back . His subjects , tired of Whig excesses , rallied about him ; he was no longer hampered by Parlia ment ; in fact , the terms on which he had been restored in i66o seemed forgotten , and a return to the pre-Common wealth Stuart absolutism to be imminent . Shaftesbury was accused of treason , and the plan in which he had made a dupe of Monmouth was held up to public scorn in the Absalom and Achitophel of Dryden , the court poet . A Whig jury acquitted Shaftesbury , and the Whigs struck a medal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went on to pillory the Whig poet Shadwell in MacFlecknoe . And Shaftesbury , to escape the royal wrath , fled to exile in Holland , where he died . The discovery of the Rye House plot to kill Charles added // to the king 's power , and he set out to punish London for its Whig temper , and to strengthen his own position even further . By the legal procedure known as Quo Warranto Charles recalled the charters of many English cities and forced the municipalities to remove Whig officials and to submit to royal control in the appointment of new repre-sentatives . It was easy for the government to know what men could be trusted , as there had been found among Shaftesbury 's papers lists of " men worthy " and " men worthy to be hanged . " And then , just at the climax of his triumph , on February 2 , 1685 , Charles II was stricken by apoplexy . For four days only he survived . Then this indolent pleasure-seeker died , having for twenty-five years , partly by deception and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation and built up an all-powerful throne . His last act was one of submission to the Roman Catholic Church ; his last words were a plea to his successor to be kind to Nell Gwyn , and a humorous apology for spending " such an unconscionable time in dying . " Charles 's brother and successor , James II , was a stubborn , uninspiring sort of fellow . He was fortunate in coming to the throne just when the Royalist reaction was at its height ; this coincidence , combined with his efficient service as Lord Admiral and his presumably steady character , strengthened his position enormously and went a long way toward offsetting his Roman Catholicism . James was further favored by a split in the ranks of the opposition ; some of the ultraProtestant Whigs supported the new king 's son-in-law , // ' William of Orange ; but others still favored James 's illegiti-mate nephew , Monmouth . The new Parliament , pre-dominantly loyal , granted James a fine income , and de-nounced the rebellious Monmouth . Monmouth himself now took a hand in affairs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beheaded ; strangely enough , however , Monmouth 's fall brought about the eventual collapse of James himself . Assisted by the Duke of Argyle in Scotland ( where Charles II and his representatives , James and Claver-house , had alienated the majority of the people by their bloody persecutions of Presbyterian Covenanters ) , Mon-mouth attempted an armed rebellion in England . But the people refused to rally to his standard ; his little army was defeated by the king 's loyal troops ; and the two rebellious leaders were executed . This success turned James 's head ; he believed that the time had come in which he could wipe out opposition and establish his own Church , the Roman Catholic , in England . He sent out a cruel judge , Jeffrey , to travel over the nation and try the rebels ; in that " Bloody Circuit " a horrible vengeance was taken for Monmouth 's rising ; women were scourged , beheaded , and burned for merely harboring rebels . The king proceeded to build up a standing army , and attempted to repeal the Habeas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps , it was adjourned . Then in a test case , the trial of Hales , James persuaded his subservient judges to declare that the king himself had a right to suspend the Test Act , and to remove its ban on Roman Catholic office-holders. // Proceeding on this assumption , the king distributed government jobs right and left among his religious sympathizers ; many of his courtiers were converted to Catholicism , among them the poet Dryden , who had defended the Anglican Church in his Religio Laici five years previously , and who now upheld his new religion in The Hind and the Panther . The great majority of Englishmen , however , were still strongly Protestant ; James 's mad policy was destined to ruin him before long . It happened that just at this time Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes which had protected French Huguenots , and began persecuting these Protestants . Thousands of them fled to England , enriching their new home with their knowledge of trades and handicrafts , and strengthening the anti-Catholic prejudices of the Englishmen . Monmouth 's death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of William of Orange ; and a Dutch diplomat , Dykevelt , came to England in 1687 to strengthen his master 's cause . The stubborn James , however , rushed madly on toward disaster . He had already created an Ecclesiastical Commission ( similar to Queen Elizabeth 's detested High Commission ) to carry out his Catholic policies in the national church ; by an illegal Declaration of Indulgence he had favored the Catholics ( and incidentally won the support of the tolerant Quaker , William Penn ) . He now antagonized the great Universities of Oxford and Cambridge by forcing them to accept Romanists in important positions . His next step was to dissolve his Parliament , which had become antagonistic , and to attempt to pack a new Parliament with his own supporters . When he found that this // would be impossible , he prepared for an armed struggle by strengthening his standing army with Irish soldiers ; and he took steps to convert Ireland into a Catholic stronghold whither he might flee if his plans in England went amiss . By the year 1688 James had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year two events occurred which drove them to depose him . A son and heir was born to James , ensuring a Catholic succession ( although the opposition claimed that the baby did not belong to the royal couple at all , but was being palmed off as theirs for political purposes ) . And the king reissued his Declaration of Indulgence and commanded the clergy to read it in church . The clergy refused , and seven bishops presented a protest to James ? a protest which he denounced as the " standard of rebellion . " The king ordered the bish ops to be tried for libel , but the sympathies of the nation were overwhelmingly against him , and the acquittal of the bishops was the signal for universal rejoicing . Practically the whole nation was now opposed to the king ; and a group of leading Whigs and Tories combined to invite William of Orange , who was James 's nephew as well as his son-in-law , to come to England and be their king . William was at first unwilling to embark upon such an expedition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Louis XIV at this moment made the fatal mistake of entering into a campaign against Germany , and William was left free to accept the English invitation . James at last realized his danger and attempted to re-deem himself by reversing his unpopular acts . But it was too late . In November , 1688 , William landed in England . James 's little army melted away ; he himself was incapaci172 RESTORATION AND REVOLUTION tated by a violent nose bleed ; and even his second daughter , Anne , deserted him . The king sent his wife and infant son to France for safe-keeping ; that son , Prince James , the " Old Pretender , " was destined to cause much trouble in his later efforts to win the crown . The king himself now attempted to escape , first burning the writs that would summon Parliament and dropping the great seal of the nation into the Thames , in a childish attempt to embarrass his successor ; but he was caught by some fishermen and brought back to London . The king 's capture , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a martyr of James , and he saw that his own problems would be simplified by getting his father-in-law out of the country . So he opened a new avenue of escape ; the old king , nothing loath , took advantage of it and fled to France . William was now established in London ; a Convention Parliament , early in 1689 , declared that the king had broken his contract with the people , and had on the advice of the Jesuits , abdicated , leaving his throne vacant . This ingenious explanation pleased all parties ? the Whigs , who believed in a contract between ruler and subjects ; the Protestants ; and the Tories , who felt that it was wrong to depose a sovereign . Parliament then issued a great Declaration of Right , restating the principles of 166o , limiting the sovereign 's power , safeguarding the liberties of the people , and affirming the authority of Parliament . On February 13 , 1689 , William III and his wife Mary , daughter of the exiled James II , were proclaimed joint sovereigns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without // the loss of any blood save that which flowed from the nostrils of the ill-fated James . The theory of Divine Right and the pretensions of the Roman Catholic Church were crushed . The Restoration principles of a modern constitutional state ? the principles of religious toleration and of a monarchy limited by representative government and by the rights of the governed ? were reaffirmed . But these principles had not yet been worked out in practice ; and the problem of effecting that working out fell to the succeeding sovereigns . CHAPTER X THE LAST STUARTS ( 1689-1714 ) " All , all of a piece throughout : Thy chase had a beast in view ; Thy wars brought nothing about ; Thy lovers were all untrue . ' T is well an old age is out , And time to begin a new . " DRYDEN , Secular Masque . In 1689 William III and Mary ascended the throne of England as joint monarchs .

William was first of all the defender of Protestant Eu rope against Catholic France ; his interest in England was only secondary . It was in order to gain England as an ally that he had accepted the crown . But the English people saw the matter in a very different light ; William 's Continental projects awakened no passionate concern in their breasts ; William was , after all , a foreigner ? a Dutch-man ; though brilliantly able , particularly as a diplomat , he was a dour , sickly sort of fellow who warmed no hearts ; and his new subjects ( especially the conservative Tory land-holders , the country squires who would gain nothing 175 // through foreign entanglements ) were somewhat disposed to let him fight his own battles . Despite all these disad-vantages , however , he was the last great king of England . The attention of Englishmen was concentrated on their own domestic problems . The Glorious Revolution had reaffirmed the principles of 166o , and had shown men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( as Charles I had done ) or dominate it ( as Charles I 's sons had done ) . No , the king was in the future to be a crea-ture of Parliament , deriving his power from it and acting as its executive agent ; and Parliament and William both knew this fact . Moreover , nonconformity was to be rec-ognized as an element in national life . These principles seem obvious enough to us ; but two and one-half centuries ago they were first dawning upon men 's minds as splendid , unformulated concepts . And the question was ? how to put them into practice ? Parliament set to work to find a solution ; for the moment it postponed the designation of a successor to William and Mary ; it left the king to fight his own battles on the Continent , in Scotland , and in Ireland ; it did not attempt to build up the machinery of party government , to strengthen the financial framework of the State , or to face a number of vexing social problems . All these tasks were sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legis-lators must look to the State and the Church . The strange combination of Whigs and Tories which had in desperation appealed to Dutch William as a savior against James , suddenly discovered that the savior himself // was going to be a trifle difficult to handle . Parliament granted to the king , therefore , only a limited , temporary income ; it was less than he wanted , and out of it he had to pay not only his own household expenses but also the salaries of civil officials . Hence the king 's grant is still known as the " Civil List , " though Parliament has long since relieved him of the payment of public expenses . A Mutiny Act gave the army a temporary legal status ; Parliament had now made sure of being summoned frequently , for the State could not exist without treasury or army , and Parliament itself would have to meet periodically to renew the temporary royal grant and the temporary military establishment . Another check was placed on the ruler when Parliament established the principle that he must spend national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would money be raised for national defense at sea and then spent on a standing army to enforce royal tyranny at home . The Bill of Rights , passed soon after the accession of William and Mary , reaffirmed the Great Declaration of Right , which had put them on the throne . Kings were no longer to be kings by divine right ; it was by virtue of the social pact , the implied contract between governors and governed , that the king was permitted to rule . This point of view was quite in accordance with the latest philosophical views , as exemplified in the writings of John Locke ; the old divine-right theory was further discountenanced by the fashionable deistic philosophy , which taught that there was no personal God interested in the welfare of kings . The Bill of Rights also stipulated that the English monarch must not be a Roman Catholic , and must not even marry // a Roman Catholic . This stipulation later played an im portant part in determining the royal succession . Such were the most significant measures which strength ened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important acts also were passed during this period . Parliament was to meet at least once every three years ; the legal rights of traitors were protected ; and judges were made independent of royal favor . The growing tendency to make ministers responsible to Parliament rather than to the Crown , had been indicated when the legislators im peached Danby despite his plea of a royal command ; it was further illustrated by William 's attempts to find min isters who could cooperate with Parliament , and by Parlia ment 's insistence on its right to impeach ministers who misbehaved in obedience to the king 's orders . The movement toward the principle of " Live and let live " in religious matters , illustrated in Locke 's Letters on Toleration , helped to bring about a sensible solu Lion of the religious question . By the Toleration Act , Dissenters were protected so long as they supported the Crown and renounced Catholic doctrines ; Roman Catholics , Jews , and disbelievers in the Trinity were ex cluded from this general amnesty . The extreme stiff-necked Anglicans , called " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegiance to William , were excluded from the Anglican Church ; they survived for a century as an inde pendent sect , claiming that they and they only were the true salt of the earth . The conflicting claims of Roman Catholic , Anglican , and Dissenter were pointedly satirized by Jonathan Swift in A Tale of a Tub , which illustrates beautifully the skeptical // attitude toward religion that was becoming prevalent . But even if men 's souls were no longer deeply stirred by re ligious problems , their pocketbooks were still seriously affected by their formal religious affiliations . Roman Cath olics suffered grievously on account of the discrimination against them ; the aged Dryden 's last years were rendered difficult because of his loyalty to the faith of James II , and Alexander Pope 's Roman Catholic inheritance added to the gall in his glittering , tortured soul . Many Dissenters found a way of evading the restrictions which kept them out of public office , by the practice of " occasional conformity .

An Act against Occasional Conformity was in fact passed , though it did not remain upon the statute books for long . One policy in which William and Parliament joined was to keep out the exiled Roman Catholic Stuarts and to ensure a Protestant succession to the Eng lish throne . James II , supported more or less openly by the French , was constantly involved in plots and struggles to win back his crown . He had many adherents in England , chiefly among the Roman Catholics and Tories , who were known as " Jacobites , " from " Jacobus , " the Latin form of " James .
