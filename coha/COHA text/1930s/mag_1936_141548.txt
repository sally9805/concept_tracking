THE BROTHERS ASHKENAZI-I . Singer-Knopf ( $3 ) . <P> European family chronicles that detail the rise &; fall of a great fortune usually follow a pattern that permits little lively narrative , few vivid characterizations . <P> For the loss of these aids to good reading , such books usually possess an elusive quality that critics call solidity : elaborate documentation on the social background , careful discussion of daily family battles , naturalistic reporting on the details of clothing , finances , property . True to this pattern to the point of tedium . The Brothers Ashkenazi resembles a Polish Forsyte Saga packed into one volume , is dullest in its accounts of its heroes , most interesting in its pictures of the growth of the industrial city of Lodz that flourished before the War , declined after it . <P> Max and Yakob Ashkenazi were the twin sons of a pious Jew who wanted them to be rabbis .

But she loved Yakob who was attracted to her . In half-primitive , backward Lodz , periodically split by savage strikes of the Jewish and German weavers , by pogroms that were encouraged by the Tsarist police , the two brothers soon became business rivals . Max coldly divorced Dinah in order to marry a woman whose fortune would aid his plans . Yakob thereupon married Max 's daughter . <P> Before their personal rivalry reached its great climax the War broke . Max made another fortune in Russia , was arrested by the Bolsheviks , saved by his brother , who was killed in an anti-Semitic outbreak . Max returned to Lodz to build still another fortune . But the prosperity of Lodz had depended on the Russian market , and as panic followed inflation the grimy " Manchester of Europe " lost its reason for being , and Max symbolically died as his city began to stagnate .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
