When newsmen at Zurich , Switzerland last week wondered why Professor Auguste Piccard continued to postpone his balloon ascension into the stratosphere , even when weather appeared favorable , the long-haired , long-necked Belgian professor told them : " I promised Mme Piccard that I would not do anything foolish . " In fact Mme Piccard , whose fifth child was born a few months ago , once made her husband promise not to make the flight at all . That was last year , just after he and his assistant , Charles Kipfer , had ballooned 51,700 ft. into the heavens- higher than man had ever before climbed - and had been unable to get down for 15 hr. because of a faulty gas valve . But while the physicist Piccard was readying his new balloon for an ascent by a substitute , Mme Piccard relented . <P> Professor Piccard had , as he promised , taken greater precautions for his second flight . He was not seeking a new altitude record . A height of ten miles , as before , would satisfy his purpose of studying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observations agreed with famed Dr. Robert Andrews Millikan that the rays emanate from between the stars. * The new aluminum gondola which he had built to carry himself and his new assistant , Max Cosyns , 25 , was superior to last year 's which , covered with tourists ' scratchings , rests in the library of the Free University , Brussels . <P> The new gondola is , like the old one , a ball 7 ft. in diameter which can be hermetically sealed from within . Instead of only two observation portholes it has eight , like an eyeball with eight pupils . The portholes afford not only a better view of the surroundings but a clear view of the gasbag above , so that the descent valves may be kept untangled . Another innovation : the entry port may be reclosed from the inside , even if opened during flight . Instead of being painted half white , half black , like the old gondola , the new one is all white enamel . Last year the black half had been painted to attract heat , for fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead they suffered intense heat and thirst . <P> Also this year the equipment includes short-wave wireless , parachutes . <P> Mme Piccard insisted upon one final precaution . When Professor Piccard and Assistant Cosyns start skyward from Dubendorf Airdrome , airplanes and racing automobiles will set out . to be near the spot where the balloon comes to rest . In one of the automobiles will be Mme Piccard . <P> *Last week unmanned balloons sent up 17 mi. ( a record ) by Germany 's Professor Erich Regener brought down evidence limiting Piccard 's observation that the intensity of cosmic rays increases steadily with altitude . Above 39,000 ft. the intensity tends to become constant .
