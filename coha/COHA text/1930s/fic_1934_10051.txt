. She felt humble in her happiness , beneath her pride . Everybody seemed at his best , everyone to be appreciated for what he was as friend or relative . Cars went past obliviously on the shade-dappled pavement beyond the trees . But a few passers-by , some women , unknown to the family , who lived over stores downtown in a few rooms , and had timed it to walk past here when the wedding was going on  --  and one or two people coming along by chance  --  slowed up to have a look at the company out on the stretch of lawn between the Fergusonhouse and the little rented house next door ; and to catch a glimpse of the bride and groom . There were all the jokes about first calling Dorothy " Mrs. Woodward . " But after that , the occasion slipped away from the bride and belonged to the guests , to everybody . The luncheon was for them  --  the carefully planned plate luncheon , talked over so long with Aunt Louie , shaped by Margaret 's fastidious exactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jennie helping , and Mrs. Christianson in the kitchen . The bride came back into her own for a little while , however , before she left . She came downstairs in her little blue silk suit and hat , with Jesse just behind her . Then everybody had to go out on the porch to see the start . It was a mixed company , but all drawn together by some long connection with the Fergusons  --  Essie , the Lowries , Ada Rist , Vanchie Darlington because of Margaret , Ethel and Richard Spencer in smiling graciousness , the Morgans , some more of the church people , and of course all the relationship . Margaret , hating demonstrations with a fierce , aristocratic averseness , would not go to the front of the group although Essie tried to push her forward . Other neighbors were at their windows . The two ran down the walk and got into the new car which Bunny had just driven resplendently to the curbing . It took a few moments for them to get seated , while Mr. Ferguson made sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car . Then their faces turned back toward the house . Dorothy had said good-bye to her mother upstairs . But now she bent forward to find her mother 's face among the others . It was still fullp301daylight . Everything was flooded with light . The familiar Iawn , the cream-colored house standing there , were transfigured . It seemed as if the whole earth , at this most beautiful time of the year , was in bloom for the wedding . And by this symbol , the dark , alien dream of the war had finally lifted from this small inland place among great cornfields . For this hour , their world had gone back to its old innocence , and everything was prosperousand fresh and sunlit again . The two young people in the shining car , with their journey ahead of them , their marvelously fortunate prospect of settling wherever they chose , had come into the free inheritance of all the years that had gone before them . The engine was started . There was a quick wave of the hand from Jesse . Dorothy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had one smiling glimpse of her face in the little blue hat . " Well , sir , there they go ! "  | MARGARET had locked her door again . At least she had a door that would lock . That was her one consolationin this house . It gave her a savage pleasure to shut herself in with her own misery and to keep the folks outside . She lay on the floor  --  the bed was too soft for her wretchedness  --  and her head rolled from side to side . This was the culmination of all her unhappiness at home . Let mother plead now . Let dad break the door if he wanted to . He had shaken it once until the whole upstairs seemed to shake . She would never forgive them again . She felt her heart as hard as a stone inside her  --  imagined hands tearing apart that frozen stone . . . The folks had not believed her . They had believed that old  --  Margaret could n't think of anything bad enough to call her  --  of a Dean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own family , and now she was n't going to pretend at all any more . Lying there on the floor , on the harshness of the rug , feeling the stealthy drafts that managed to get through the storm windows , Margaret went back through the whole story . She felt as if she were looking back into the seductive shine of Sybil 's eyes  --  but remote , with a sense of hopeless estrangement , almost as if Sybil were dead . She could n't exactly wish for the old  --  it was n't exactly friendship ; more fascination  --  back . The folks had spoiled it for her . They had believed just what the Dean of Women had told them . Well , it was true , Sybil was deceiving her father and the faculty , and she was in love with a man who was getting a divorce , and meeting him " outside . " Yes , and Margaret was helping her to deceive . But none of it in the way that the folks thought . She felt again the futile , struggling pain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , she had never been able to explain anything to them . Her real life had always been lived inside herself , in secret . The others were the kind of children that mother and dad really wanted . She had always been the off one . " Where does she get it ? " Margaret could hear Aunt Ella saying that , in her flat , naively wondering voice . Sometimes mother said it too , in despair . Margaret remembered how she used to brood over being adopted . She had always felt like an aristocrat in disguise . " Margaretalways thinks she must have the best of everything . " That had long been an accusation against her . She used to imagine the kind of parents it seemed to her she must really have had instead of just the folks . She wanted her father to have distinguished gray hair and black-rimmed eyeglasses with a very broad black ribbon . And she wanted a father who adored her , like those artist fathers in books  --  the mother had conveniently died at the birth of the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn pale . Virginia Brattle 's father was a little like that , so that Virginia had always seemed to Margaret something like a girl in a story  --  except that Mrs. Brattle was very much alive , and she and Mr. Brattle spoiled the story by squabbling over Virginia . The things that dad had said to her when he came to the Normal after her were cut deep into Margaret 's memory in a bleeding pain . She felt that she could never have a father again . But she was frightened of being in the world without one . She imagined herself leaning her head against a big strong chest , smelling of harsh expensive wool like Frank 's , a deep voice telling her indulgently that he would look after her . . . Frank Gesell was more her father , in her heart , than dad was . Margaret began to cry again , but drearily , rolling her head on the harsh nap of the rug . How could she stand never to see Sybil again , to lose all the luxury and loveliness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the square-cut bottles with ribbons from which Sybil dabbed little dampnesses of perfumeon Margaret 's hair , so that she went stepping down to dinner in a dreamy , scented luxury . . . . She moved with restless impatience , away from the soothing  |p307heat  of the radiator , and in the chill from the north window the wretchedness of the whole winter enveloped her . She could never get back to that day in Geneva . The folks believed that she had disgraced herself forever by going there . Margaret did n't care . It was always the " bad " things that she did that gave her any happiness  --  like skipping school , or playing with the wrong crowd , or slipping up to dance in the Odd Fellows Hall with that red-haired kid on the basketball team from Hanging Rock . If she were to die right now , she would choose that day with Sybil and Frank as her one day to remember . That was Margaret 's chief fear : that she might die without having had one perfect day . Even the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if it had n't been for Sybil and Frank , she would have thought it was just in books that people were ever really happy . She never thought of any other people she had known as being actually lovers . They just went together , or were silly over each other , or something like that . Regular marriage meant being like the folks , presenting a united front to the world , neither one doing as he or she wanted to do . Or like Aunt Ella and Uncle Ben , stuck together and forever bickering . Or like Grandma and Grandpa , who had always seemed to think that young people when they reached a certain age must just naturally get married unless there was " something the matter with them , " and then the next step was to begin raising a family . " What 's the matter with him ? " Grandma would always demand , when she heard of any single young man past twenty-five . Marriage , Margaret had always thought of as just the end . She did n't regret a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lied to the Dean of Women  --  the Dean deservedit . Dad had tried to make her apologize . He could n't see that it was because she scorned to lie that she would n't say she was sorry ; and he had n't known what awful , shaken , painfulcourage it had taken to hold out against both of them . Margaret felt as if she could have stood it if the Dean had asked her straightforwardly , when she got back from Geneva that night , if she had been with Sybil . But not a word ! Margaretremembered how sweetly the Dean had greeted her going307p308in to dinner , walking beside her and asking her if she had had a nice day and had found her sister  --  while all the time site knew everything about it , knew that Sybil had gone with Margaret to Geneva , and was writing the folks . And the folks thought it was all right for the Dean to deceiveher like that . It was the Dean 's " business , " they thought  --  they actually thought that ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own father , who had taken the Dean 's part against her . I le had told her that he and mother were both ashamed of her . She had given them more trouble than their other children put together . They would rather have their boys at war , he said , fighting for their country , than to have a daughter acting as she had done when they made sacrifices to let her go away to school . And then he threw it up to her that she had n't stuck it out at Wilson , either  --  she was just restless , did n't know her own mind . . . . Her own family , her own folks . That was the worst of all . She would n't have cared about being suspendedif they had felt some sympathy . Oh , mother did , in a way  --  but they both acted as if she had done all this on purpose to make more trouble for them just at this time ! She could n't help it if the country had gone to war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just did n't understand that she had felt that she was doing the real , hard , underneath kind of right in helping the lovers . Mother laid it all on Sybil . Sybil had corrupted her . Margarethad planned it just as much as Sybil ! She had asked the Dean for a day 's leave of absence in Geneva to meet her sister  --  of course she had n't any intention of seeing Dorothy . Margarethad put some of Sybil 's things in her own bag ; and Sybil had pretended to be going over to the campus , but had stopped in at the little drug store and telephoned for one of the two town taxis  --  Sybil was the only one of the girls who dealt boldly with things like taxis . She had stayed hidden in the ladies ' toilet , because people from the Normal might be on the train ; and then at the Junction , she and Margaret had got o ( 1 , and Frank had met them with the car . . . . That long , smooth , purring ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all three in together in the luxurious warmthp309of the richly upholstered car  --  now it was a dream . And a still brighter dream was the dining room of the hotel  --  their secludedcorner table , with the rosy light casting a circle of shade on the glittering tablecloth , the spiciness of the roses intermingled with the good smell of food , and the dark little waiter bowing and running . It did n't seem as if it could have been just Geneva . It had seemed like a city somewhere else . Margaret , in spite of her last year 's coat which she hated , had felt that she and Sybil were feted beauties . Sybil and Frank had made her almost more the heroine of the occasion than Sybil herself ! Now she could get a sad exultance remembering the things Frank had said to her . " We do n't need any lights with those eyes at the table . " " Some lucky man 's going to get a big kick out of that hair some day . " They were compliments about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make her over into the kind of person she ought to be . And all the time they were eating , the rain was making splintered streaks of brightness on the dark windowpane . . . . Sybil and Frank had n't dared take her to the courthouse . The wedding was to be absolutely secret . That was part of their loving protection of her . " If they ask you if we were married , you were n't there , see  --  you do n't know anything about it . " Frank had got a taxi for her , and a magnificent violet-colored box of candy sheathed in glittery tissue paper  --  Sybil would n't let him get flowers , because the girls in the dorm would be sure to ask about them . . . and then they had both kissed her  --  she was pressed to the glowing softness of Sybil 's face in the midst of the wet gray fur of her big coat collar , and she felt the excitingmale pressure of Frank 's big lips and smelled the wet wool of his expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . and she was in the taxi , back in the familiar , overheated train . . . . And now she was just at home . That was over . She was going to visit Frank and Sybil in Chicago , and they were going to take her to dine at the Drake , and Frank was going to let her and Sybil  --  " both my girls "  --  go to Marshall Field 's and each pick out an evening dress . A new life had been opening before her in a dazzle of radiance . And here she was back atp310home , with only the folks and Bunny . How awful home had looked to her when she had come back to it ! The wind struck icy along the brick platform where Margaret stood dumbly waiting and staring at the red-and-black water tank on black cinders flooded with ice . They rode home in the town taxi , where she was squeezed in between her father and a traveling man , on the broken-down seat of black leather worn to the weave on the folds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The traveling man coughed , and she thought they were all going to get the flu . They had to keep silent because they could n't let Bob Wessel know that she had been sent home . Bob Wessel , who had got his foot cut off in an accident when he was drunk , and was n't fit to do anything but drive this old taxi ! Margaret could n't see much of the streets through the dirty panes in the side curtains ; but she knew how they were , icy and lonely , the trees looking scrubby and bare , old vines frozen against the streaked side walls of houses . Dad fumbledaround to get just the right change out of his purse . Margaretthought of Frank Gesell 's opulent roll of bills in a smooth brown leather folder that he carelessly shoved down into his pocket after he had paid for everything . She saw the house standing in its winter ugliness , dark streaks down the light-painted walls from the bent-over pipe at the eaves , patches of ice on the withered brown grass , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brittle and thin from the caked , frozen , flower-pot earth . And of course by this time everybody in Belmond knew that she had been suspended from the Normal ! Margaret thrashed about , beating the rug softly with her fist . Still , in a hard way she was glad . It put her really apart from the rest . The Dean in her letter , trying to smooth things over , had pretended that Sybil was " a bad influence " and " not the sort of girl "  --  that was the worst of all , that suave implication that Margaret really was " the sort " ! Her eyes sparkled with fury . But the folks did n't even know it was an insult . Sybil and Frank had seen . They had treated her as the only girl in the Normal worth their attention . They took it for granted that she was a person to whom wonderful , out-of-thep311ordinary things would naturally happen as soon as she got out of the wrong pew . Mother and dad , at best , thought her someone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Carl . Margaret wanted to do something desperate to show them ! No , they were on the other side . She classed them in with the Dean of Women . Dad had written that terrible letter  --  but mother had let him write it , and instead of taking it back , just cried . Mother wanted to be on all sides at once . That was like all married women ! Nothing  --  no worry over her being thin , no shamefaced suggestion from dad that it might be nice to visit Aunt Louie next summer  --  could ever make her forget . She remembered the horrible pain of that trip home when the coldness of the November cornfields outside the window had seemed to cast her out , because she was suspended from the Normal , and her own folks were against her . The hideous winter seemed to have lasted for years . The town was worse than it had ever been . The dark cloud of the war and the epidemic hung over it . Now even the movies were closed . And , thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still pretend to believe the Bible and then think a whole nation ought to be killed ! Now they would never get her to church again . She would n't go through the misery , if that was all the good it did . Fighting with the folks , and then rushing up to lock herself into her room ! But in a way , Margaretreveled in these quarrels . They gave her a chance , when she got thoroughly wrought up and off her guard , to tell the folks things she had hidden and brooded over since she was a child . She had accused them of not caring for her . That hurt them . They tried to deny it . " But you never would open up to us the way the others did . " " Because you never understand or believe me . You do n't believe me this time . " " Yes , darling , I do believe you did n't mean  --  " " I did mean . Oh , you just do n't see ! " They might talk about loving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had heard mama , years ago , saying how she was so dark and Dorothy was so fair  --  she had heard that and never forgotten it . That had given her some reason forp312thinking she might be adopted . But anyway , Shakespeare had fallen in love with a " dark lady " ! The discovery of the " dark lady " was the one thing she had got out of that dreadful old Shakespeare class where all they ever did was read the different speeches and then " tell the meaning in their own words . " The folks had tried to make friends with her . Mother had even suggested that she have some of the girls over and play cards . Once , what would n't she have given to be allowed to play cards like other people ! But then the folks had been too religious . Now even Bunny played . Lately they had been trying another tack . They were letting her stay in her room , " not noticing " and not trying to force her to open the door . Nothing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone back to the bank . The warm , steam-heated house was flooded with its silent afternoon leisure : But Margaret would not sink back into that leisure . She was hard against her childish desire to break and cry in mama 's arms , away from this awry aloofness , folded warmly into harmony . At night she thought wildly of running away and breaking with the folks . But her inexperience terrified her . Darkness and danger and sickness were everywhere . Now she could n't even teach . She had only gone to the Normal because it was n't Wilson  --  and then teaching had seemed a sure way of getting away from home , buying her own clothes , not going to church , saving enough money to go off on her own . Anyway , she would n't stay in this house ! She got up , stealthily tiptoeing as she dressed , expecting every minute that her mother would come to the door . The sense of loneliness rose bitterly in her throat as she walked down the street . All the same , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and miserable  --  if she had been having some romantic affair , with a married man , like Sybil and the heroines in modern books  --  she could have got a dark kind of pleasure out of this lonely walk down the long street past frame houses with ice crusting the roots of the pine trees in the yards . Margaret thought about Dr. Redmond . He was the onlyp313possible person for such a role in Belmond  --  he had prematurely white hair and wore Palm Beach suits ; and he belonged to that fast young married set  --  still called " young married set " although they were all middle-aged  --  that the folks thought were so dreadful . Richard Spencer was cute-looking and a good dresser . But he was in the bank with dad . Sometimes Margaret 's dreams reached through darkness into bright future , and then the man with whom she was having the great love affair was a stranger , in New York , or even Europe  --  an artist , so that she would be known to history . But sometimes , even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had to imagine something that could happen right the next minute and make living possible  --  make her have a great tragic experience behind her when she left  --  and then it was Dr. Redmond . But he always loved her more than she did him , and she always left him . She could n't contemplate staying in Belmond . That was why she had never really been interested in any of the boys in high school , although she had wanted them to admire her  --  they seemed to bind her to Belmond . How could she make all this begin to happen ? She had to know . Her innocence was a humiliation . Then she could be equal to Sybil , not just hungrily admiring . She could deal with men like Frank Gesell with no more timid fear . Then she could read poetry with a satisfied feeling that it had all happened to her , instead of with that baffled , shamed , hungry wonder . She could write poetry . It was a love affair , of course , that she wanted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Carl . One of those side streets , a block or so long , led off from this street . Margaret felt again its shoddy , unnamed quality that seemed in some queer minor way native to her . It was here where she used to sneak off after school and play with Irene . Irene Jackson ! What had become of her ? And that mean little Gowan kid whom they used to call " Squirrel-Eyes " ! Margaret suffered still from the way her clandestine friendship with Irene had been broken off . She had never forgiven Carl . What was that dark , different wisdom that girls like Irene possessed , that made them mockingly superior to the people who talked about them ? Just as , in a way , Lucifer was superiorp314to God . He knew more . Afterwards , though , Margaret had been so ashamed of not being able to ask Irene to her house that she had gone through agonized maneuvers to avoid Irene at school . Even now it hurt her to remember her cowardly perfidy . Lucille and Edna Mae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detested Mildred ! When she looked back into her life , there were just two people in this town with whom she had not been friendly from force of circumstances , or from her own frozen fear of coming out before disapproving eyes in her own colors . Irene was one . And the other was that woman from New York who had visited Mrs. Richard Spencer . " Grimmie , " Mrs. Spencer called her . She and Ethel Spencer had been schoolmates . Miss Grimm was the first woman Margarethad ever seen who was really what she thought of as " different , " " distinguished , " who had a style of her own . Of course , mother and the other ladies called that queer-looking . " But is n't she queer-looking ? " She was n't pretty like Ethel Spencer . Margaret had not yet fully decided whether she liked odd , distinguished looks the best , or whether she wanted the most completely impeccable Parisian elegance . At any rate , Miss Grimm did n't look like anybody in Belmond . Ethel was beginning to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become more important in the bank . She had invited mother to the reception she gave for Miss Grimm ; and Margaretand Dorothy had very graciously been asked , with VirginiaBrattle , to pass the refreshments . Margaret , bringing in the handsome silver cake basket that Ethel had resurrected from the old Spencer house , had walked softly with her lashes drooped in awe , but lifting them once for a look of adoration at the eagle profile and the fuzzy black hair drawn in straight bands down each side of the face to a knot at the back . Miss Grimm had worn a big rope of beads and queer earrings , and there was a sort of Russian embroidery on her flowing sleeves . Afterwards , when the girls had gone to get their wraps , Ethel Spencer , flitting gracefully to thank them , had taken Margaret 's hands in her soft little fingers and murmured , with that luminously flattering look she could give  --  " Grimmie asked me , Who wasp315that child with the marvelous eyes ? " She had seen . People who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , where people like Ethel Spencer 's friend might like the queer things about her looks , then she , too , might have a chance to become a person with a style of her own ! But it was too tragically distant . On a day like this , with a bleak watery feeling in the air , the trees motionlessagainst the gray sky , she seemed to have no power of getting anywhere . She dreamed of writing to - Miss Grimm and asking if she could n't get a position in a bookstore . But she was afraid . Margaret thought of New York as filled entirely by " different " people , all sophisticated in a glittering way , and knowing strange secrets of art and life . She would be a coward if some time she did n't try to find out those things . The walk ended here . Margaret 's final dream , no matter how she started out , was of herself in marvelous clothes and long earrings coming back to Belmond  --  not to stay , of course !  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passionate , tragic and glorious experience , such as no one could have here at home . Now she had finished her new variation of that . To go on into the country would be a kind of lonely triumph . But then she could never stop thinking until her mind was screwed up into a painful whirl . She turned , and walked hurriedly to her old haunt the library , although a feeling of dreary stuffiness came over her the instant she went up those whitish stone steps , traced now with wintry footprints , and on into the hushed , overheated stack room . She ranged forlornly among the rows of books . There were only those rebound copies of Lazarre and the Red Pepper Burns novels in the little cart . The librarian came tiptoeing into the stacks and whispered , " Finding what you want ? " She had always been interested in Margaret , she had once told the folks , Margaret was such a reader ! But the favor of Miss Vanchie Darlington hurt almost more than it pleased Margaret 's vanity , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who came for dates out of the library . Margaret writhed under the ignominy of being thought " quiet . " She at down in the rocker near the magazine rack . Thep316unbecomingness of her old coat and brown hat that looked so shabby at the tail-end of winter would not let her have the superiority that her pride demanded over Vanchie Darlington 's thin , sallow , sweetly smiling face and two pathetic loops of fading brown hair . Margaret reveled in dark satisfaction at having been suspended from the Normal . " Oh , here you are ! " Her mother had come into the library . She was smiling brightly and ignoring the last quarrel in that way she and dad must have agreed to try now . Her gray velvet hat was a little crooked , and Margaret disapproved severely of the way her skirt hung . " What are you reading , dear ? " They never liked the things she read , so why pretend to answer ? " Let 's go downtown now . I want you to help me choose things for supper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheerily . " Nothing . " It was all the worse to have mother so sprightly and pretendingthey were such good companions  --  she had acted that way ever since Margaret had told her she was always more friendly with Dorothy . Just outside the library , they met Mrs. Viele . " Well ! Does n't this look nice ? These two pretty young ladies in their nice warm furs going about together ! " Margaret saw her mother beam at that . How could she ? But the folks did n't seem to care anything for the truth . While the two ladies talked , Margaret stood aside . The things Mrs. Viele said were always worse , because she saw everything in a rosy light and never knew the facts of the case . Margaret dug with her oxford toe into the hard crust of snow while she had to listen to , " And how is Carl ? And Lillian and the little ones ? But it 's so lovely that you can have Margaret this winter ! " " She 's so nice ! " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't bear her . " " Oh , Margaret ! "  | " Well , she just gushes . She knows I got sent home from the Normal and that you and dad do n't want to have me here . " She was savagely pleased to have brought tears to her mother 's eyes . They went on down the street silently . Margaret had put two big kettles of soft water on the oil stove for her bath . She lay full-length across her bed while the water was heating , with her blue crepe kimono open across her chest which she contemplated with frowning absorption . Her skin tinted with brunette was smooth . But she was so skinny . Her collar bones showed . Her breasts looked small and unripe . She thought of Mildred 's breasts , how softly white they were in the glimpses she had caught of them when they undressed for gym , and of how they swelled , adequate and womanly , beneath her silk blouse . Mildred Summers had been more popular with the boys than any other girl in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so sweet , and just working her schemes all the time , wanting nothing else in the world but to get married . Dorothy , even when the two girls had started to college , was what their mother called " developed " ; and that had always made Margaret , with her little long thin arms , and her scrawnily unfledged neck with its brunette darkness , feel herself at a resentful disadvantage . She had always felt that Dorothy , with her easy-going good times , was really the daughter of the household . Their bedroom was almost all Dorothy 's . She was the one who had the photographs of smiling college girls with marcelled hair and youths with hair combed wavily or slickly back from their open foreheads . Sybil 's picture was lovelier than that of any of these girly-girly regulation friends of Dot 's . But of course Margaret could n't put that up ! There was just one thing in this room that was really hers . That was her desk . She got up and padded over to it , barefooted . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well from pleurisy , and she had been allowed to pick it out for herself at thep318furniture store . The cheap little varnished affair with curlicue ornaments and rickety legs was still precious to her . Every few weeks , Margaret went over her books , to rearrange them according to some strictly personal plan . At one side , she kept only " new " books , the newest and most dangerous , that she thought no one else in Belmond would read . Between brass book-ends she had set her own personal , intimate favorites  --  Marie Bashkirtseff , and Wuthering Heights , and Mrs. Gaskell 's Charlotte Brontte , because in the seclusion and stormy emotions of the Yorkshire sisters she felt some of her own loneliness and rebellion . And then , most preciously kept of all , the small notebookwith shiny red covers in which she copied with exquisite care , in the blackest India ink , all the poems that seemed to fit into her own existence . She had just copied , when she found time at the library , some of the Sonnets from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the angels . But she got a dark joy out of reading to herself " I lift my heavy heart up solemnly . .. " Standing there now in her bare feet , curling the toes of one narrow foot over the other , Margaret whispered it to herself . " Behold and seeWhat a great heap of grief lay hid in me , And how the red wild sparkles  --  " Her cheeks burned , and she felt a sweet , fiery thrill .. " Margaret ! Your water must be hot ! " Oh , dear , she could n't even take a bath without the whole family getting excited ! In angry haste , Margaret rushed into the bathroom , and got some of the black off the bottoms of the kettles onto the white rim of the tub when she dumped in the water . Why did n't the folks put in a water heater , like other people ? Dad always had to be so careful . He would do it some day , when the children were all gone , and he and mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " her mother always said . " Do you have to have two kettles every time ? You know what dad said about the cistern . " But Margaret had decided not to care if the family did run out of soft water before the next rain , be/cause of the importance to her of indulging in these wonderful steamy baths in which she had a mysterious hope that the delicious amber softness of the water would make the dark places around her collar bones white and perfect in preparation for going somewhere and beginning her real life . But she avoided the sight of the mirror because of the scrawny , sallow look she feared she would have until the bath had flushed and freshened her skin . When she finished , however  --  in spite of her dissatisfaction with the family 's plain white soap , which they always bought from that crippled man  --  she rubbed away the silvery mist from the glass . She looked at the thin little naked image , shrinking with sensitive consciousness of its defects , beseeching it to know if she dared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attraction from Dorothy 's blooming prettiness , and Mildred 's blond softness  --  even from Sybil 's charm , with the warm ripe body , and those shining , seductive , greenish eyes under the fluff of sandy hair . Her eyes glowed darkly with the memory of Frank Gesell 's praise . She was sensitive and unsure about them even yet , thinking of how Carl and Harry Santley used to tease her and call her " Pop-Eyes . " " Where did that child get those great black eyes ? " How often she had heard that ! There always seemed to be a kind of reproach in it . Margaret had the trick of letting the lashes droop , partly because of the boys ' teasing , but even more to veil the ardor that she felt would give her away if people really looked into her eyes . But Frank Gesell was a real man , who had a business of his own , and had been married and divorced , and could order taxis and flowers and send waiters on the run . What did innocent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys who felt important ushering in church ? Margaret had always known that there was something romanticin store for her . Frank  --  an admitted connoisseur of women  --  had recognized it . Her own confidence in it made a burning core of pride in the empty blackness of her heart . She spread out her long black hair all around her , and turned , with a dancing motion , until she had the very best light on the image in the mirror . The dark eyes flashed back at herp320from between black draperies of hair , and for a single moment she was as she wanted to be . Passionately she yearned to overcomeall her awkward and scrawny defects so that she could be worthy of that strange delight of which poetry was full , and for which she felt that fate had marked her out . She saw the secret triangle of black hair curling softly below the white belly with its subtle brunette tints . She felt rare and precious . But she heard steps outside the bathroom door , and halted , poised in her secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the detested blue kimono and twisted her hair up into a top-knot  --  perversely glad to look just as plain and hideous as she could . Now if mama saw her , she ought to be satisfied ! " Wait a few minutes , dear , and I 'll go with you . " Margaret heard that as she was putting on her hat . " I have to hurry . Vanchie wants to leave . " She did n't intend the folks to think that because she was working in the library now , and Vanchie liked her , she was going to be satisfied to stay in Belmond ! " How lovely for Margaretto be in the library ! " She made a face . It helped her pride to be able to walk down the street in lofty solitude and not to have succumbed to the weak craving for having her mother with her  --  to keep on the bad terms that her pride and integrity demanded , instead of slipping down into false , easy good terms . She could n't help cringing a little when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she knew how they regarded her having been suspended from school . Vanchie thought she had been a victim ! The library was tedious , when hour after hour passed and no interesting stranger came in to discover her reading good books . But it was a refuge . Vanchie was alone . " What pink cheeks our lady has ! " " My cheeks are never pink . " " Oh ! Just look in that glass ! " Vanchie put on her coat and rubbers  --  the drab-brown coat that Margaret knew as well as her own  --  and the wide black hat trimmed with the ribbon bows of a past era . " Where does she get those hats ? " people always marveled . " Listen , Vanchie ! " Margaret suddenly cried . " Tell my folksp321that I 'm such a good librarian I ought to go away and take a course . " Vanchie took it very seriously , although Margaret did n't know whether she 'd thought of saying it until just this minute . " Where have you thought of going , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to go somewhere . " Margaret looked up at Vanchie with eyes fiercely tearless . She drew into herself , hard and untouchable , because she did n't want Vanchie to get too near her . There was something too pathetic and personal about Vanchie 's affection , although it helped Margaret 's vanity . Vanchie had fallen under Margaret 's domination with meek gladness . It was almost the way that Ada Rist used to be . Vanchie had a wistful , older woman 's faith in the radiance of Margaret 's future . She was nervous now about Margaret 's judgment on books . Margaret liked to come out with wild , bold statements . They flustered and pleased Vanchie  --  Vanchiewho , to so many people in town , seemed patricianand aloof ! Vanchie was reluctant and afraid to lose her , but too dreadfullyand sweetly unselfish to give in to that . " Oh , I do wish you could go to Boston ! " There was a faded shine in Vanchie 's colorless eyes . Her big hat was crooked and fine short hairs strayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you about my trip East ? It was the most wonderful . . . Wait . I think I have the pictures . " Vanchie went into the sacred inner room about which  --  Margaret remembered guiltily  --  the girls used to have jokes , pretending that Vanchie retired there to pen love letters to Lawrence Brattle who was supposed to be the most cultured man in town . How mean they all used to be ! The little room was neat and intimate , with a framed photograph of Vanchie 's parents , and a couch with faded college cushions where Vanchiemade Margaret lie when she had a cold . " Here they are ! " Vanchie came out looking eager but a little embarrassed . " It was one summer  --  oh , I 'd hate to say how long ago ! You would n't even remember . There were three of us , Amyp322Sanderson , and Julia Viele , and I. Can you find me ? " Vanchie gave a little trill of embarrassed laughter . " Look at the hats ! " The picture was taken with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course she could find Vanchie . She wore her hair in just the same loops , and her wide sailor hat  --  which Vanchie thought so funny !  --  was n't very different from those awful hats she wore now . What did surprise Margaret was that Vanchie looked young ! There was an evanescent softness , a rounding of her prim slenderness , a radiance in the too-sweet smile that lingered only in that wistfulnessnow . " Where were you ? " " Where was it taken , you mean ? In front of Longfellow 's home in Cambridge . There , you can just see the house . I loved New England . It 's so full of interesting , quaint old places . Just look at us ! Do n't we look like three gypsies ? What a time we had to make our parents consent to let us go gallivantingoff that way  --  three young girls by their lonesomes ! It was the most wonderful time I ever had . " Margaret gave the photograph back to Vanchie . While Vanchieput it reverently away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by old Mrs. Spencer . She supposedin Vanchie 's day it had been adventurous for those three girls to make a trip East and visit historical places . But did Vanchie think anything like that would satisfy her ? " This bean jar came from Boston . We got it in the funniest little place down in a basement  --  I remember Amy would n't go down , and she thought Julia and I were terribly bold ! " Vanchie touched the bean jar with loving remembrance . There were some pussy willows in it now . " Well , " she said , " good-bye , dear . I 'm so glad you spoke to me . If you really do want me to have a talk with your mother and father . . . I know you 're wasted working here in this little library . But I shall hate . . . oh , I have that new book of poems you wanted , dear . I slipped it into the list . " She left . Margaret sat wrapped in the heated , silent air . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new volume of poems was by a woman . Margaret had seen the title in thep323catalogue which she always searched hungrily . Maybe the book would yield her  --  if it was any good  --  more of those tantalizing hints of the way love seemed and the way it had turned out in another person 's life . That was why Margaret had to devour books of poetry and memoirs by women , even those titled British women who only wrote gossip about other " important " people and tried to make themselves sound ravishing and smart . She could n't actually make herself intend to be a librarian . But after the things that Sybil had said about the girls who wanted to be teachers , she could n't bear to think of teaching . Besides , being a teacher always made Margaret afraid that she would get to be like Fannie Allison , who had taught the third grade ever since anyone in Belmond could remember , who stuck little net yokes into her collarless dresses , and who lived with her brother and his wife and took care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a cloistered but more asthetic atmosphere about Vanchie , with her love for " the best in literature , " and the nice old chairs and dishes from the Darlington home in her room at Mrs. Keppler 's . . . Yes , but if she was going to get away , there was the long , awful time of forcing her own way against the folks  --  who did n't believe in her , did n't think she was capable of getting on by herself , or of keeping on with what she had started . " You know the other times , " they would say . They had to call Margaret two or three times to get her to the supper table . Mr. Ferguson wanted to be angry , but Mrs. Ferguson gave him a warning look . " Come , dear , now . Put on your kimono . Do n't dress until after supper . We want to get through in time to all go to the concert . " They were taking it for granted that she would go with them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the homelike pleasantness of the dining room at this hour . She tried not to see the evening light across the table and the bright red jellyp324in the cut-glass dish  --  or to see the funny little sawed-off bouquet that was the kind her mother always picked , cosmos and nasturtiums mixed up together , with some little scraps of sweet alyssum . " I wanted you to arrange the flowers . But I could n't find you . You can make so much prettier bouquets than I can . " Margaret would n't answer that , nor be diverted by praise of her taste in arranging flowers from the issue that must be settled if there was to be any real friendliness between them . It was like a hard transparent wall between her and the folks . Mother tried brightly to ignore it , when it was n't just absolutelyvisible . But she need n't try to make out that they were a loving family party sitting here at the pleasant supper table ready to go to the concert together , as Mrs. Viele would picture them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You must n't go over to the church now , there is n't time . " " Why not ? " " Why , the concert ! " " Oh ! " Dad looked ashamed , and naively uncertain . He followed mother into the kitchen . Margaret was left sitting alone at the supper table finishing her raspberries , with thick cream from the farm that turned a faded pink as she stirred it . It made her almost ashamed herself that dad failed with such awkward honestyto play up to mother 's little schemes . Mother was trying to show how , when none of the others were here , she and dad and Margaret could have such good times together ! But now that the wedding was over and all the company gone  --  everyone away that could get away , even Bunny escaped on a camping party  --  all that mother had to fall back upon was an ancient , resurrected band concert ! Margaret put down the souvenir spoon  --  mother was using the pretty silver , and the best china , trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all such an en-tanglement ! " We wo n't stop to do the dishes , dear . We want to get nice seats . What are you going to put on ? " Margaret wanted to say , " Nothing . I 'm not going . " But thatp325bright little hopefulness of mother 's overcame her . She could only be sullen and unresponsive . They were pretending that now that Dorothy was married , and she was " the only girl they had left , " they could all be sweet and happy here at home . They were counting upon Margaret to stay at home and " comfort " them when Bun went away to college . " I 've ironed your yellow dress . You can wear that . " What a tremendous concession ! It was the dress that mother hated , because she said it made Margaret look " so dark " ; and that made Margaret think again , just as when she was a little girl , that the family really thought her dark and hideous . Margaret sat down on her bed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seem to get any farther . The house was awful again . For a little while it had been filled with the excitement and eclat of the wedding . But now the household seemed to have slipped back into the dreariness of an earlier day . Margaret was the only one left . Carl and Lillian were grown-up married people . Dorothy was married and gone . Even Bunny , before long , would be a college boy . And Margaret could see herself , getting older and older , a spinster daughter and a fixture in the house  --  as bad as Essie Bartlett ! That seemed to be what the folks wanted . They were afraid to let her go . For a little while , they had kept her contented , by letting her furnish her own room and go to Geneva to do her shopping . Vanchie had told them that " Margaret was doing so well in the library , it would be lovely if she could take up the work " ; and they had gone so far as to talk about " some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiance , she was getting thin and sallow . Everyonenoticed it . Aunt Ella had said cheerfully , " Maybe she 's getting consumption . " Dad 's brother John had died of consumption , and he had been thin and dark . She would get thinner , take revenge on them , die if they did n't send her away  --  get rid of all scruples , all compunctions . But they were afraid to let her go !  --  for mother knew that if she went , it would be forever . " Here 's your dress , Margaret . " Mother had come to the door . " Oh , have n't you even begun to get ready ? Never mind  --  " shep326went on hurriedly  --  " there 's time if you start right away . We 'll be out on the porch . " Anything was better than staying in this room . Now that it had lost the fragrant luxury of Aunt Louie 's things , it seemed bleak and ordinary ; and Margaret could n't be consoled any longer by having her own furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bathroom , too , and the clean-smelling towels and the cool tingle of the water would n't let her hold to her hardness . Her big eyes looked back at her from the mirror dark with remembrance of Frank 's praise . She could n't be hideous . Not if Frank and Sybil did n't think so . There must still be hope for her in this world . But when she started to put on the yellow dress , perversity made her take it off again . What was the use of trying to look decent when everything else was wrong ! She would wear as unbecomingthings as she could , to please the folks , and then when she got away she would dress exactly as she wanted to . " Oh , here she is ! " Then mother noticed . " But why did n't youMargaret answered proudly , " I did n't want to . " They had to ignore it . They were afraid of a storm from her , knowing that now their vague promises would have to be fulfilled . Mother had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the car until the brake-bands were fixed . " All right , let 's walk ! " mother said brightly . But at least she did n't take hold of their arms , an arm of each , to show how friendly they all were , when they were n't . " How lovely Mrs. Viele 's flowers are ! " Margaret would n't be interested in anything in Belmond . Dad looked vaguely over at the Viele lawn , but he never even pretended interest in such feminine things as flowers . " How do you do ? Yes , is n't it ? " Mother nodded and spoke brightly to people . They reached the little town park where the band concert was to be held . Not many people were there . They need n't have hurried . " Do you want to sit close , or at a distance ? " " Oh , this 'll be all right , " dad said . They took one of the straight , greenpaintedbenches with the seats sawed off slant-wise at the ends.  |p327Mother  sat down , smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silly to pretend that this was fun , when almost nobody cared that they were trying to revive the old band concerts again . Cars stopped now and then for a little while , and then drove away . Margaret sat disdainfully silent . Mr. Ferguson said , " I do n't call this much of a crowd . " " Well , they have n't begun yet . You know everything is always late . " But Margaret saw that even mother realized the entertainment was n't turning out very well . " There 's - Mrs . Dunn ! Shall we go over and sit with her ? " " What 's that ? What do we have to move for ? " " Why , dad , I thought it would be nice to sit near Mrs. Dunn . But if you do n't want to  --  " " Oh , that 's it . No , I do n't mind . " Margaret silently followed the folks . As if she cared about sitting with Mrs. Dunn ! If the folks thought that was any entertainment  --  ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of having Lloyd so far away , and Mrs. Dunn 's pride in having her son a soldier . It would be someone like Lloyd Dunn , Margaret thought disdainfully , who did n't have brains enough to do anything for himself , who would stay and get into the regular army ! Mrs. Dunn laid it on thick about Lloyd , giving Margaret sharp little glances of mingled resentment and satisfaction , meaning that she had now forfeited forever the glorious chance of Lloyd 's attentions . Margaret looked coldly at Mrs. Dunn 's fat , creased neck , with the gray and brown hairs straggling below the brownish coil , and the thick fat of the shoulders above the corset and under the cottony texture of the figured voile . " Yes , is n't it nice they 're starting again . I think every town ought to have a band . It brings people together . " Rains had made the grass in the park thick and dark green , and the leaves thicker and even darker , so that in the sultry heat of the middlewestern summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ominous heaviness . Margaret moved her feet uneasily as she felt the mosquitoes at her ankles . She intended to stick it through grimly , though  --  show mother ,  |p328when  it was over , how much there was for her here in this town . " Do you think we want to hear all of this ? " dad asked at last . " These mosquitoes seem to be after me . " " Some folks they bother , " Mrs. Dunn said . " Well , unless Margaret  --  " " I do n't care , " Margaret answered with disdain . Mrs. Dunn accepted complacently the offer to go with them . Finally they were back on the sidewalk . Margaret could see that her mother 's face was troubled , and wondered , with a mixture of scorn and compunction , if mother was thinking of her own young days when the band concerts had been great occasions . She tried to picture dad bringing mother into town and buying her a sack of popcorn . But she could only see the folks at the age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girls might be here , " mother said . " What girls ? " Margaret coldly demanded . On their way out of the park , through the blare of band music , she could see that mother was nudging and making signs to dad . When they reached the walk , he said , in that shamefaced tone in which he followed mother 's lead : " Well , shall we stop and have some ice-cream ? " Margaret went upstairs ahead of the folks , when she got home , and into the refuge of her bedroom . It was a refuge , even in the breathless thickness of the heat . She got into bed quickly , so that she would n't have to talk any more to the folks . After a while she could hear them getting ready for bed in their room . So fixed  --  so dumpish  --  such a united front to the world , and then mother was always lying inside and acting as if she agreed with dad when she did n't . It made her disgusted and impatient  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor . " I 'm never going to get like that ! " But she simply could n't endure it to stay at home any longer . She could n't stand it any longer when mother and Aunt Ella and the rest got started on marriage . Somehow she had to escapep329from that humiliating superiority of married women , the wise " You 'll know some day ! "  --  the humiliating admonitions at the wedding , " Margaret , you ought n't to let your little sister get ahead of you this way ! " Mildred Summers had married Gardner Allen right out of high school . Not that Margaret considered that much of a triumph any more ! Still , it had been a triumph at the time  --  " the first of the girls to be married . " And Mildred greeted her with smiling patronage , saying , " Hello , Margaret  --  what are you doing these days ? " Now even little Dorothy was admitted to the wise , whispering company of the matrons , who could look down upon the uninitiated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town would be to forfeit the real story of her life . What she wanted was to look down upon this town  --  to know something wild , rapturous , free . . . . But it was different since Dorothy was married . The memory of the bridal kiss on the lawn seemed to open up a new world with a presage of piercing delight . As once , the male touch of Frank 's big lips had given her just a fleeting , hungry suggestion of joys more hotly actual than those of the pure passion between the characters in Wuthering Heights  --  until then , her ideal . That , she did n't have to experience to understand . But what was bodily must be experienced . Imagination only brought a frustrated , aching pain . It used to be her dream  --  to find the perfect complement , the other self , who thought and felt exactly as she did . She had thrilled with passionate sympathywhen Catherine said , " I ant Heathcliffe . " But now , seeing Jesse 's face with the dark line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margaret felt instead the portending excitement of difference . That was the thing she craved to break the narrow , intense , self-bound world in which she was imprisoned , and to make her complete . Not marriage , though  --  the kiss of marriage was consecrated and made docile and pure before it was even experienced ! " And for one hour of ecstasyGive all you have been and could be  --  " one of the things she had copied in her red notebook . What did it matter if you dragged through a whole lifetime withoutp330that  --  without the very most rapturous thing there was to know ? Margaret kicked off the sheet impatiently . She looked down the length of her body in hard disdain . She knew all her deficienciesbetter than anyone else could  --  with a searing knowledge , after the hours , secret and agonized and lit with hope , that she had spent in front of the glass ! But she had never felt that this was really herself . There was something pent up and concealedwithin this hard little body , if only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been just a sparkling glimpse of it at times  --  with her powdered hair , in her Martha Washington costume , in the rose-and-green sheerness of her bridesmaid dress . She would have to endure and go through anything for the sake of that  --  and soon , for she could n't stand the humiliation of her innocence any more . That made her afraid . Here at least , hidden and dreaming , she had herself  --  her little hard , untouched self . She exulted in that knowledge . The life of last winter , now that it had passed , seemed to have a lonely romance about it . That was always the way when she looked back upon things ! Margaret could see that aloof little self , guarding its secrets , writing in the red notebook , crouching hungrily on the outskirts of passion . The glamour of her books had seemed to make a kind of starlight inside the room . The folks could n't stop her . It was because she had feared , inside herself , to break away from that dim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which she had her secret being untouched . Yes , but if she was ever to know what the splendid , reckless kind of people in books and history know  --  Cathy and Heathcliffe , and the mistresses of kings  --  and that was the only kind of life she cared about having !  --  then she could n't keep herself hidden and intact any more . No matter what it did to her , she would have to break through her self-distrust and fastidiousnessand pride . It was a kind of consecration to ecstasy . In the hot secret darkness  --  a dog barking outside , a car going past with the grinding of the clutch  --  her thin body uncovered on the bed was quivering into a dream of blossoming . . . not just her body , her whole self . Sybil 's choice of her , and Frank'sp331praises , the devotion she had always drawn from people like Vanchie , and like Ada Rist , her old satellite in high school days  --  she had these things to go on , besides the queer absolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ core of fire , under the blighting coldness of fear and disapproval and misunderstanding . Out at the farm , she used to run into the grove , feeling that the dark fir trees standing there were on her side . That was what she wanted more than anything else  --  to come to herself . But until a man whom she could love had recognized and confirmed its special kind of beauty , her body would have to stay thin and cold in its alien sheath of self-distrust  --  and her whole self stay , tight and unripened , within her body . MARGARET sat in the train , in the green velvet seclusionof her Pullman section . She looked out at thestations between the wide stretches of country . But somewhere in her mind , beneath these actual sights , was the memory of the car drawn up beside the station platform ; and she could still see the folks as they stood there together , looking up at her , while the train was pulling out . All her life she had meant to get away from them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . There was a dreadful wrench of loneliness in the onward-rushing noise of the train , in the rattle of the couplings , when at noon she went unsteadily through the Pullman coaches to the dining car . The coffee joggled in her cup , and not even the silver shine of the cover that the colored waiter lifted with a cherishing flourish from her platter of sweetbreads could take away the solemn finality of the backwardrush of country she was leaving . All the little towns they were passing made her think of home . She kept seeing people who looked like the folks , and cars that were just like their own car . The train stopped , and she stared out at another brown/and-yellow depot , another town that  --  with its vacant lots across the track , and its asphalted street under shady trees leadingto the business section past a dingy old frame house with a shingled tower  --  might just as well have been Belmond . The innocent sameness of these towns made her queerly guilty and remorseful , and harassed her with a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these places that kept the the sense of failure alive in her  --  that made her as she had always been , and yet knew she was n't . The country itself was shadowed over with the feeling that she could find no acceptance in it . It belonged to the folks and the folks ' ideas . . . the great rollingcountry , where the rough stubble was getting brown in the fields , and autumn was drying the rich pastures . She had always felt more at home in the landscapes in books than anywhere here . . . in the picture of some old palace garden in the bound magazine copies in the library . . in the fairytale house with the green door that stood in the midst of the forest . . . . All the distasteful phases of her meager little history in Belmondwere smarting in her . If only she had something romantic behind her !  --  if she were leaving someone like Dr. Redmond a sad and broken man . No boys had ever kissed her , except Harry and Carl for meanness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as good as they gave her . She had had her little triumphs , but they had all been the wrong ones . It was Mildredwho had won the Gardner Allens !  --  while Margaret , by some dreadful fatality , had attracted only the Lloyd Dunns . Oh , yes , her horrid little triumphs  --  but always on the wrong grounds  --  always with a fatal flaw . Worse than anything else  --  far worse  --  was the smarting sense of her own unsatisfactoriness . But she had never been herself . Only at moments  --  when she had jumped off the highest pile of shingles in the lumber yard , and won the admiration of even Carl and Harry for her daring . As long as she stayed with the folks in Belmond , she could be nothing but a kind of shadow , creeping resentfully about the edges of things , or staying apart in frozen agony  --  never able to get into the open . Oh , the folks had their grievances , too . They told her she thought more of anybody else than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take in that tramp dog one night last winter  --  the dog that was around town everywhere ; and that dad said ought to be shot for his own good . And look what had happened ! Right on the best rug . And then after they had chased the dog out of the house in righteous wrath , Margarethad gone out to the alley and petted the poor old uncouth , homeless creature to make up for their cruelty . She could always make excuses for cats and dogs , they told her . But she did n't care how she hurt them . But Margaret knew with secret shame and torture that she did care . She had to go about the house wrapped in her air of scornful dissatisfaction , or she might have given in to her mother 's hurt , uncomprehending eyes , and piteous , sprightly little efforts at cajolery . Only she could n't , must n't care about hurting the folks  --  they were too close , she had to keep her purpose secure against them . Just because dad had worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's arms had a pleading touch , she could n't let herself forget that they had never acknowledged , never even perceived , a single one of their wrongs against her . Her way of doing things was always queer , and they cared more for their other children than they did for her . . . oh , that conviction was at the very center of her count against them , so that she could n't give in to them no matter how she ached with loneliness . " What makes you do that ? We do n't understand you . You 're the queerest child we ever saw . " So she could n't admit them , either . No matter how good everyonethought them , how everyone trusted dad in the bank , how Mrs. Morgan and Essie Bartlett and everyone said that mother and dad were the salt of the earth . Her life would n't fit in with theirs . The strange , long , broken night passed , in the swaying darknessof the Pullman berth . Now , at last , the landscape was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unexpected town  --  an old brick station , of a between-stage in architecture , with an arcade and fancy posts stained dingily by the weather . But at least it was not just like the station at home . The ground was getting thicker , more turfy , older , darker . There were great brownp334rocks with ancient water streaks painted blackly down their sides , and houses of discolored red brick with shutters that made Margaret think of the Revolution . Oblivion came over her as she stared through the window  --  but the oblivion of restless expectation . The country was visibly different now , and that , while it frightened her , seemed to set her free . When something had happened to her  --  when she knew  --  Margaret had always thought she would write great poetry . A series of love sonnets , maybe . She could almost see their vast , shining outlines in her mind . Margaret took her bag , and trying to look haughtily traveled and impersonal and experienced , she went to the dressing room . No one else was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin , dark , secretive face looked back at her from carefully veiled eyes . Was that herself ? The complexion wore the sallow tinge it always had when she was a little upset . She could see now , against her will , that she really did look a little like Grandma Ferguson  --  and the thought made her furious . She did n't want to look like anyone in the family . She cherished the thought of being just herself . Grandma 's hair , when she was a girl , had been long and black . But Margaret 's large dark eyes with the full eyelids were not like Grandma 's sharp black eyes , or Aunt Ella 's dull ones . They were her own . No one knew where they " came from . " She went back to her section , around the smooth turn from the dressing room . The trip was almost over , and there had been no exciting and gratifying adventure . None of the men were distinguished-looking ; and Margaret had frozen out those two fussy women who were always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unendurable brightness of her visions  --  because she did n't have much time for them , soon she would be put to the perilous test of making them come true . They were going through miles and miles of dingy suburbs that seemed to be left out of any real scheme of architecture  --  to be on the desolate , nameless outskirts of any recognizable way of existence . But any place that was strange held romantic possibilitiesfor Margaret . She scorned to be too eager to put on her wraps , like those two elderly women , who were calling to thep335porter again to know how soon they would be in New York . Margaret 's hands were trembling . But her inner excitement held her tense and darkly scornful in the midst of a stirring , large excitement that threatened to dissolve the boundaries of all she knew of life . The darkness and sudden static feeling of a great railway terminalhad come over the train . Now Margaret was glad to have the ladies ask and the porter confirm it . They were there . It gave a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Through this darkness , people were moving toward the door  --  halting  --  step by step they were getting out of the train . Margaret felt the strangeness of firm ground . People and people and people poured into the open doors of the great station . And she was here in the midst of them , one separate little person arriving in the multitude  --  not looking , in her tan coat and small felt hat , the kind of person she really felt . herself to be . Margaret felt crushed . Her breath would n't come right . She was arriving with nothing but humiliation and emptinessbehind her , and she was too uncertain now to think ahead . Her feet were just following the nonchalant , accustomed footstepsof the redcap who had her bags . Light poured down in great slants from somewhere above them . . . and there was the floor hard and actual and interminablywide under her feet . Margaret had a confused , exciting , unhappy awareness of the crowds . There was only time for a glimpse of foreign black moustaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made her envious . . . and they were past , the crowd had shifted . She paid the redcap and stood alone . The cathedral light of the station filled her with such awe that her knees were trembling . Margaret did not know why she had dismissed her redcap , or where she wanted to go . She picked up her bags herself , staggeringa little , although she scorned unaristocratic behavior ; and she tried to feel as if she were hurrying too  --  somewhere . . . . She went past shining windows of little shops , stirred by the sight of books , a red dress , a silken medley of tinted stockings  --  makingher think desperately of all the things she wantedp336and did n't have  --  and how was she going to get them ? Everythingthat she saw was hallowed by an irrefutable distinction because this was New York . Still trembling , Margaret came out into the brilliant sunshine of the city , blue sky above , horns snarling through the confusion of traffic . She felt a thrill of rejoicing , tentative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . But at the same time she was breathless , small , insignificant , and lost . Shc was glad to get into the refuge of a taxi  --  although she could have walked and walked , walked forever . . . . She sat rigid through the hurried , swinging drive that seemed to blind her with the confusion of all she did n't have time to see . She had another moment of breathless , stopped bewilderment when she got out of the taxi into a street that seemed high and rocky with , the towering apartment houses . It was like being in some giant graveyard , among titanic tombstones , the buildings were all so high and stony and dull white . In a secret torture of fear that she might have mistaken the number , Margaret went up to the desk in the apartment house and asked for Mr. Bellew . " Are you Miss Ferguson ? " " Yes . " The man handed her a note . Mr. and Mrs. Bellew had gone out of town for the day . They would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the apartment and make herself perfectlyat home ; and there was a nice little tearoom just five doors down the street . She would find the door of her room open . She was not to be worried . They would be back before nine o'clock . Margaret was ashamed of her own craven weakness in wantingsomeone to welcome her first , without plunging straight into unknown , exhilarating danger . She must enter cautiously , feeling her way , clinging at first to what she knew even though she despised it . Mr. Bellew had been superintendent of schools in Belmond . Now he was taking a course at the Columbia Teachers College . To think of being a student with Mr. Bellew !  --  it showed how exciting and jumbled up the old pattern of exist/ence was here in New York . Margaret felt a distant respect for the Bellews , going off on some adventure and leaving just a note , instead of being here to look after her , as people at home would have thought was their duty with company . She was glad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was afraid . The colored boy carried her bags out of the elevator and down a stony corridor that made Margaret think of either an office building or a prison . He fitted the key into a heavy door that opened upon darkened , empty air . " Anything else , miss ? " The imaginary picture of her room in New York  --  something both artistic and distinguished , drawn from novels and magazinepictures  --  had to change into the actuality of a plain room with miscellaneous furniture . The folks had believed that she would be " safe " with the Bellews . That was one reason why they had finally agreed to let her come to Columbia , instead of going somewhere near home . But what was she to do with herself ? The emptiness of the rest of the day was frightening . Margaret'sexpectations seemed silly . She missed the motion of the train , the crowding excitement of the Grand Central . It was stuffy . She managed to put up the heavy window , with an instant 's slanting glimpse of the stony street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belmond , had told Margaret that she must go to see Miss Grimm . Somewhere among the jumbled towers was that distinguished figure , surrounded by " interestingpeople , " and promising an initiation into all that meant New York . But now she seemed farther away and harder to reach than when Margaret was in Belmond . Margaret felt at once tired and restless . Even in the narrow , shut-in , oldfashionedbathroom , where she had to turn on the electric light , she was aware of the city outside . Her eyes , although tired from two nights on the train , had their glowing look , not their shadowed , dull look . Nothing was in the least as Margaret had imagined it , and yet she could feel , even here , the surrounding stir of immensity . She could n't just stay shut up in this apartment ! It seemed wildly adventurous to go into that stony street alone . Margaret did n't know what she was afraid of  --  having her purse stolen ,  |p338or  losing her way , or just being inadequate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom in wandering about where no one knew her at all . The air was fresh in the shade and the sky still brilliantly blue . She caught a sparkle of water . She went on and on , wild to see taxis and well-dressed people and the kind of buildings she had read about . She was in New York . She was drunk with exhilaration . But then the sun got lower . The brightness was gone from the streets . Margaret felt the stony chill . Suddenly her eyes were aching , and her new magic vitality , that had seemed to lift her into another kind of being , was gone . Afraid either to ask or find the way , she cravenly took a taxi back to the apartment house , knowing what the folks would think of the extravagance . She had the depressed feeling of still being just the same MargaretFerguson stealing into this alien place . She sat down beside the window and leaned her elbows on the sill . But even up here , she could get the feeling of being in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed within the great tangle of noises . The white buildings of the university would shelter her for a while until she could find her own kind of existence . But after once having been in these streets , she could never just go off to some little town and be a librarian . She wanted her own kind of things , the things that were more real to her intimate self than the furniture at home  --  fireplaces , candles ( even to light a twisted penny candle left over from the Christmas tree had given her a feeling of festival ) , and always , somewhere in the scene , a distinguished-looking man and a beautiful dark woman seated in low chairs , and their faces just turning toward each other in passionate surrender . . . . The noise continued , made up of infinite variations , and yet with an enveloping sense of sameness . Lights were on now , glitteringin triumphant constellations . Margaret felt as if she were caught and whirled away in the jangled symphony . Margaret got off the bus in Washington Square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without Mrs. Bellew.  | " Some day we must go down and explore the Village , " Mrs. Bellew had told her with a laughing , apologetic , and yet daring , eager air . But then they would have been two people from Belmond out to see the sights . The cold wind , with its bleak watery feeling , whipped against Margaret , so that it was only through aching , tear-filled eyes that for a moment she saw the Square with the empty fountain and the arch stony against the colorless sky . She could n't just stand here . She walked off at random , with what tried to be a purposeful air , along one of the paths between empty benches . She was at a disadvantage because she did n't know where she was going , but on the alert because any of the people she met might be artists . A fat shoddy woman in a shawl passed her , and then two young Jews with their eager , chilled , spectacledfaces thrust forward . They made Margaret angry , because they acted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary bourgeois people like herself , from the Middlewest , could n't understand . But Margaret never got tired of seeing " different-looking " people in New York . They seemed to contradict , thrillingly , all that the folks thought and said , all their comfortable certainties . Once Mr. Bellew had taken Margaretand Mrs. Bellew to the East Side . " Oh , you must see the East Side ! See how the other half lives . " With a gratified , information-seekingair , the Bellews had gone about among these " queer , foreign people . " Margaret had followed with a hangdoglook , acutely conscious of the provincial flaws in her own party , and wanting to apologize for the Bellews ' self-satisfaction . It was just the same with all their excursions . When they went to the theater , Mrs. Bellew pointed out interesting-looking people and whispered about them . " That man looks like some kind of a count , does n't he ? Look ! Those must be real society people  --  the four hundred . What do you suppose that girl is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist . My , but do n't you see a lot of funny-looking people ! " She always seemed to be ingenuously admitting that they had no part in such an interesting scene  --  and yet keeping a small , provincial , complacentsuperiority . But Margaret still went about with thep340Bellews . New York overpowered her  --  the idea of it , because it was New York . She had the feeling that if she started out alone her real life would have to begin . And she still was n't ready . She was n't actually ready to start in today . She had her old feeling of being invisible , a kind of ghost wandering hungrily through these streets to find her habitation . She saw the old houses along the north side of the Square , and turned and walked all the way past them , reveling in their . early eighteenth century elegance . Sometimes it seemed to Margaretthat her real home was in one age , sometimes in another . She used to think she might have lived in a Spanish castle , dark on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she felt almost as if fate had turned her out of one of these houses . Perhaps elegance was what she liked most of all . " I live here , you 're my house , " she said rebelliously to a white doorway . An old childish , romantic part of her mind still connected real stories with things like white doorways and velvet hangingsand the glow of a sea coal fire on a stormy night . She came to a little alley , that she recognized with an obscure thrill as a real Village place . She walked to the end and back , with a feeling of stealthy intrusion and of almost incredible recognition at the sight of lanterns above doorways and odd little windows with the frames painted a hard Italian blue  --  things that she seemed to know with a kind of personal inner knowledge in an altogether different category from her actual , ground-in knowledge of plain windows at home with curtains and draperies . Artists lived here . Margaret was humble and excited . She felt that they would not accept her  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because she had had no experience , and with her eyes stinging from the cold . Yet under her cringing diffidence  --  the external image of herself from which she could n't get away  --  she had a fiery inner certaintyand resentment . Little shops . Little odd , different things . They were what Margaret had always wanted and had felt belonged to her personally , as distinguished from herself having to live mixed up with other people . The bleak wind made her eyes water , and herp341legs in silk stockings were bitterly chilled . But she kept walking on in a cold , uncomfortable daze of happiness . Candles , in waxy colors , at last her fill of candles  --  little foreign things , bizarre jewelry , little bookshops with queer names where they sold the kind of books she had always supposed she was the only person in town to read , perhaps the only person in the world . . . . Margaret made herself break through her cold glaze of self-distrust . She always tried to recall Frank Gesell to her mind , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't fit in here . She went unfortified down several steps and into a bookshop . A little bookshop , from which the books always seemed more aesthetic and daring . The warm air made her slightly dizzy . A girl with bright black hair laid in careful flat curves ( Margaretwas always hungrily collecting data about haircuts ) and with lips painted an American-beauty red , was sitting at a desk and talking to a pretty young man in knickers . Margaret was dashed by the superior sophistication of the painted mouth . She felt an instant predatory jealousy . But she would n't submit to this cool , supercilious neglect of herself as a patently uninterestingcustomer . She asked for a new book of poems , savagely glad to interrupt the conversation . The slim volume with its purple-and-pink striped cover would add to her vicarious store . The girl negligently tied up . the package in smoke-gray paper and purple string and then went back to the pretty youth . The two young people had an intimate air of knowing the place and not caring to bother with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Margaret that they acted as if they were initiates of the inner secrets of art of which she , in her tan coat , was ignorant . But at any rate she had made some assertionand not gone meekly out of the place . She imagined Miss Grimm getting a place for her in a little bookshop  --  and then she saw herself , in a miraculously becoming haircut , talking not to a pretty boy like this but to a tall , lean artist with keen eyes and face worn by the world 's sorrow . . . . By the time she went out into the street , she could feel her spirits soaring toward that pitch of heady exhilaration where she could forget her deficiencies and commit some piece of reck/less daring . It was the feeling she used to have just before she jumped from the shingle pile . But there could n't be anything interesting on a street that had an elevated . It was too shoddy and commercial . Margaret walked back to the Square to get her bearings ; and then somehow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very sort of street she must see  --  very crooked and narrow , with the painted doors and colored curtains giving her the necessaryfeeling of art and oldness and oddness . But there was a shoddy actuality about the dirty , uneven painting , and about the iron grating in front of a basement window  --  a crudeness about the blue-green paint with its hard lumps . She had never counted on that . She had never imagined , either , big dented-in garbage cans filled with the dingy bleakness of old ashes , and poor skinny cats nosing among the scraps spilled from a broken paper bag . Down in a little basement shop , with " Ann 's place " daubed in childish letters across the glass , a stubby old candle and a blue vase stood on the window sill . If she was going to be a bohemian , would she have to put up with an unheated room , cockroaches , and the awful feeling that hair and skin could have when you washed in a little cold water on a winter morning ? Margaret hated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grandma Ferguson 's . She could picture the splintery wooden floor of Ann 's place . It made her hands feel blue and swollen with grimy cold , the way they used to feel when she looked through old piles of things in the attic on a winter day . Now the demand for luxury , so strong in her  --  " Margaret always must have the best ! "  --  was frightening . Because she would have to break through that , too , unless she was just ready to give up and accept the regulation things . Margaret was afraid that she was not a real artist in spite of her dream of writing love sonnets after a great experience . She was ashamed of all those old free verse ravings , in India ink on very white paper , about " my grief " and " my sorrow " and " you . " Who was " You " ? Just a very dimly remembered Gardner Allen when he was the pretty boy in the grades , or the red-headed kid with whom she had danced in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment when he had kissed her . Or just someone imaginary . " You did not see The hands I flung . " That was about Dr. Redmond , more or less . But he ought to have recognized her through the dark little disguise of her lonely shyness ! Margaret had never dared send any of these exquisitely written and carefully cherished verses to a magazine . To herselfthey were significant and precious , commemorating her own life and imagination , but out among real poetry they would have no meaning . Little houses opening right on the street aroused Margaret 's old craving for some place that could be the setting of her own story . More and more she hated to go back to that stuffy old apartment with Mr. and Mrs. Bellew . It was n't for that she had made the folks send her to New York . But she had been a little unsure even with the Bellews at first , because they had been in New York all summer . They knew how to use the subways . She was gratified , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They spoke with pride of having taken cocktails at a party , and then said , " Well , you know , you have to do some things so you wo n't be conspicuous . " Mrs. Bellew had worried for fear that Margaret would be shocked ! Of course the folks were for Prohibition . The Bellews were themselves , at home . In a restaurant , Mr. Bellew had lighted a cigarette and said jauntily , " When in Rome , do as the Romans do . " He had offered one to Margaret and Mrs. Bellew , but only in a jocular way  --  that would be going a little too far . At first the Bellews had dazzled Margaret with their talk of the new plays she must n't miss seeing , and of the interesting places where they had eaten . She was impressed when she saw their progress from the way she remembered them in Belmond , living in that little rented house with the bay window , doing all the regulation things , both of them singing in the Methodist choir , and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon saw that they were only jaunty and excited with their year off , and were just the same people , really  --  no more interesting thanp344Carl and Lillian . She , with her youth and the boldness of her secret intentions , belonged in New York . But of course the Bellews were nice to her ; and one part of herself liked them and was soft to them , as just other people . Margaret looked into the windows of all the little shops with uneven doorways , at Russian smocks with red embroidery on coarse-woven linen , and silky scarves of peacock-blue with batik patterns like brown cobwebs , like patterns formed from the smoke of cigars , or like the faded prints of great , brown , skeleton tobacco leaves . . . cringing a little at the shoddiness all around her , the cold wet smell of fish from a shop with a wet floor , the dark little children with dirty noses  --  and yet gratified in some secret place because everything was different , intimate , small . . . silver jewelry with handicraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . with a rising excitement that burned through the pain of craving for nearly everything she saw . Well , why should n't she go into a tearoom if she felt like it ? What if she was late getting back to the apartment ? Why did she have to be so terribly scrupulous ? Because she had inherited it from the folks . The whole Ferguson tribe was like that . Dad always did business on time , and if mother had to help at the church , she must be there even before the minute and do even more than was expected of her . The Fergusons were always to be relied upon . Well , that was a good reason for beginning to practice bohemian haphazardness . . . . And why did she have to feel so afraid ? Even if she did n't look the way she wanted to , could n't she just submit herself to the new experience ? Why must she go through this silly , secret torture before she showed herself to any new people ? She used to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did she honestly think she was n't as good as other people ? Then kill herself and be done with it ! Only she did n't think it . And if they supposed so , just becauseof her diffidence , then they were fooled ! Angrily , her eyes in a dark set blaze , and her face rigidly expressionless , Margaret turned and went back to the tearoom.  |p345She  wanted to go into one of the most Villagey of all . One in a basement . Something in her , something that she scoffed at , romantically craved it  --  just as , when she was a child , and they were all playing , she had to go back and tiptoe alone into the darkest , most creaking corner of the barn . She had noticed " Marta 's " painted in fat blue letters and a candle tipsily burningbetween chintz curtains . She went down stone steps and through a cold , shabby hallway . With an inward shrinking for which she scornfully berated herself , she opened the bluepainteddoor with an old-fashioned latch , the sort people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reaction from the cold made her tingling and dizzy . Margaret did n't know whether to be disappointed or relieved because there were no artists in the tearoom . But she was saved again  --  to her shame , her secret relief  --  from the great encounter that was going to change her whole life . She sat down on a blue-painted bench . There was one of those horrid floors . But there were candles , and a feebly burning old chair leg in a straggling soft mass of dingy gray ashes in a fireplacepainted the same blue as the walls . Margaret 's lids drooped over her telltale , ardent eyes . The candles and the fire deeply pleased her  --  although she could n't help being a little squeamish over the way the candle had dripped blobs of cold white tallow on the wooden table . But she was going to get over things like that . She still ached with cold , and a draft from under the poorly fitting door chilled her feet . The old familiar bitterness of not belonging rose in her throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she forced herself to stay on the hard cold bench , trying to get hold of the shining audacity that was hidden somewhere in her cold dullness . She had been in New York almost two months now , and she had n't , in spite of her little excursions into tearooms and art galleries , and buying caviar and pate de foies Bras and eating them on crackers at night in her room to learn expensive tastes  --  had n't stepped immediatelyinto an utterly different existence . She was still taking her library course , and going around with Mr. and Mrs. Bellew . P346To the people who would eat in a place like this , she supposed she would seem just a regulation Village tourist . A tall thin girl with queer hazel eyes , wild and bright , and a curly childish mass of chestnut hair , came now to take Margaret'sorder . " But I could n't wear my hair that way , " Margaretthought enviously . She did not look at the girl directly , as she ordered cinnamon toast and tea , but tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She felt all at once dreadfully commonplace beside this girl 's slightly dingy , yet charming , elfin oddity . Later , she saw the girl staring at her from the kitchen door . What was it about those eyes ? They were a little too close together , and one of them was set slightly slanting  --  but they were attractive . Margaret stared haughtily at the wall . She supposed her clothes , or something , were dreadful . Margaret never permitted herself to think of any pleasing reason why people should look at her . Those eyes ! There was something not quite human about them . Maybe the girl was a genius or something . She had disappeared into the kitchen , to Margaret 's relief , but now she came in with two little fat brown teapots and a flowered cup with a chipped saucer . Margaret noticed her thin hand , attractive also but none too clean , with a very large silver ring . " You are n't Margaret Ferguson , are you ? " Margaret could n't believe she had heard that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl spoke in a breathless rush . Her queer hazel eyes had a bright stare . " I do n't suppose you remember me . Jane Gowan ? " Margaret was excited but disappointed . She had thought this girl was some odd genius  --  not anyone she knew ! " I do n't suppose you do remember . I was in the B class and you were in the A class . I was terribly dumb . I lived in Belmondonce  --  until my dad had to leave town . You used to go home from school with Irene Jackson . You were playing being Lady Phyllista and Countess Dorinda . I was terribly impressed ! " The A class and the B class  --  Irene Jackson and the Lady Phyllista  --  Margaret could n't believe such words were being . spoken , in this little basement room with the candles , whereP347she had expected to find some unknown genius writing immortalpoetry on the back of an envelope ! Then she did remember . That bright hazel stare , wild , and yet disarming ! Only no wonder Jane Gowan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had lived next door to Irene Jackson , in that horrid little house with tin cans in the yard . . . that Mr. Gowan who had had a fight and almost killed a man on Main Street , right in front of the bank , and people had said he ought n't to be allowed to stay in town ! There had been a skinny little kid named Jennie Gowan . She did n't pass in school . She was the one who had hung around , bothering Irene and Margaret , when they were all dressed in their imaginary ball gowns , about ready to enter their coach . In the midst of her amazement , burrowing back into the darknessof memory , Margaret could realize what it was now about those hazel eyes . " Squirrel-Eyes " was what the kids at school had all called little Jennie Gowan ! They were suddenly excitedly glad to see each other . " I did n't know you were in New York ! " Jane said with childish eagerness . " What are you doing ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would Margaret have confessed that she was taking a library course ! It made her feel like Vanchie or someone . Anyone who had known Irene Jackson !  --  had known that little off side of Margaret 's childhood history instead of the everyday side ! There was a queer , somewhat shoddy halo about the memory of Irene even yet . Margaret tried not to show how much she admired Jane 's tall childish thinness in her odd , tightfitting , torn black dress , and the mussed prettiness of the tousled curls . " What are you  --  " " Oh , I 'm just helping Marta right now . She took me in out of charity . I 'm out of a job , " Jane confided blithely . " Marta ! " she shouted . " Come here ! " A buxom older girl in a blue smock came in from the kitchen . " Here 's someone I used to admire ter-ribly . Margaret Ferguson , this is Marta . I do n't know her last name . Guess she has n't got any . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Margaret Ferguson lives in Belmond , where my dad had a fight and had to leave town . " " Well , sit here and curse your native village together ! Excuse me , Margaret . I 'm making a cake . Is n't that wonderful ? " Margaret felt the aching chill go from her hands and feet and the warm brightness come into her blood . To think of finding that little Squirrel-Eyes , of all people , here in New York ! The unlikeliness of that made the place even more jumbled-up and exciting . Jane brought herself some tea , and sat and asked questionsabout Belmond , and Margaret replied with ironical answers . There was a secret defiance of the folks in this alliance with a girl who came from the wrong part of town and whose father had had a fight on Main Street . There was the exciting realization that under their ironical quips they were both workingoff their grudges against the town . " I have n't heard of Irene Jackson for years ! " " Oh , did n't you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerk in a little hotel  --  and then one day she ups and offs with a rich old customer , and he died and left her all his money , and she 's living in Paris in perfect grandeur . Oh , yes , did n't you know that ? " Jane snuggled down beside Margaret and squeezed her hand . " Listen , some night I 'll give a party , and you must come ! I 'm crazy about having you here . You 're the only person in Belmond I ever wanted to see again ! " If little Squirrel-Eyes Gowan could change as much as that , why could n't Margaret herself ? It was a miracle ! But the world was getting to be full of miracles . It seemed sometimes as if the earth was shooting off on some dizzy orbit , like a rocket , and that the past did n't count any more . Margaret walked boldly into a barber shop and had her hair cut . The barber held up the long , shorn , black locks , and asked : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Panic came over Margaret . Mother used to comfort her , when people praised Dorothy 's curls , by saying how long her hair was . But mother had really mourned over her straight black hair . Its length hadP349been her only pride . . . No . She would n't take it . She wanted to be rid of the stuff altogether . She walked out of the barber shop with her hat too big for her and resting on her nose , and the back of her neck naked and cold . " Why , Margaret FER-guson ! " Mr. Bellew thought , of course , that he must be facetious . But Mrs. Bellew was wistful , and talked about cutting her own hair  --  wispish , drab-colored hair , faded and dry ; it seemed cruel to think of it in comparison with Margaret 's new crop of shining black . The hair cut made Margaret feel different altogether . She could n't quite trust her own elation at the view , in her hand mirror , of the bold outline of her cropped head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was filling out a little , too , and beginning to look slim instead of scrawny . Now , when she glanced at the mirror in the drug store where she ate her lunch  --  obliquely , always , for she had never quite dared risk a full view of herself -- she thought she caught the sparkling look of her eyes instead of the dull veiled look . Of course she had always intended to become beautiful . Margaret did her library work with meticulous competence , just as she had done her school work . Her pride , and her Fergusoninheritance , demanded that . But Mr. and Mrs. Bellew , who had thought of her at first as the kind of girl who would make a good librarian , were beginning to be a little doubtful about her now . All the time , Margaret was tentatively , thrillingly , occupied with herself ; with the changes that even the Bellews noticed , the whitening and filling out of her unfledged neck , the shininess of her hair that had glints and gleams of brownish red in the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a preparation . When she walked down Fifth Avenue , she felt an aching , raspingenvy of the beautiful things in windows . After she had taken her bath at night , she went through a scrupulous ritual of tending herself , a secret , devout preparation . . . stealthily , so that the Bellews would n't wonder why she was still up and what she was doing . She would n't admit to herself how much she counted uponP350Jane Gowan 's party . It had taken the place of the hope that some day she would gather courage to go and see Miss Grimm . It would n't be the passport to the world of " interesting " people  --  but to a kind of secret , dark , haphazard basement world through which she must pass before she could really be rid of what she used to be . She let the Bellews suppose that the invitationwas from some girl in her library course . How shocked they would be if they knew she was going down to the Village to see that little Jennie Gowan ! She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her : " Remember what we told you about those Villagers ! " But there was uneasiness under their determined facetiousness . They were n't quite sure of a girl who lived in the Village , even if she was going to Columbia . They had seen Margaret changingand getting away from them . Mr. Bellew thought he must be funny about the books she brought home . " Are you going in for these free versifiers and Russian novelists ? " He thought there was something immoral about free verse and modern painting , and yet he was a little bit afraid because he did n't understand it . The Bellews had both agreed that Margaret was getting to think too much about her clothes . It was glorious to be away from that stuffy apartment and out alone in the rainy darkness . There were just the misty ghosts of the tall buildings , but their outlines held a distant power . Margaret got off the bus in the Square . Fearfully she carried out Jane 's haphazard instructions , going quickly through the exciting little secret streets until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses . The iron basement railings were coldly misted with rain . The street excited her in some minor way , just like that rutty little off-street where Irene used to live . She pressed a dubious-looking bell above a card lettered girlishly in purple ink : Gowan-Rindeniller . . while she waited , shivering with nervous expectancy . The door clicked feebly . Margaret pushed it open and stepped into a chilly narrow hall carpeted with linoleum .   " Here we are ! " Looking up from the stairs , she could just see Jane 's face looking down at her from over the top railing . Margaret climbed the narrow stairway that leaned perilously to the side , refusing to let her fastidiousness take alarm at any dinginess  --  because she was n't going to be shocked by anything in New York . She wanted to know the worst . She had had enough of the best , of " the bright side of things . " Jane 's eyes stared glittering down at her from the hanging tousle of curls . Jane squeezed her hand . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why not ? " " Oh , I was such a little perp when you knew me . " " What do you think I was ? " " Oh , I thought you were grand ! " She took Margaret into a funny little anteroom . On one side stood a wabbly dresser painted that same hard shade of blue , on the other a very dirty kitchen table with a gas plate . Margaret had to pretend that nothing seemed strange to her . Jane was wearing that funny little scant black dress and dangling earrings . Margaret wished that she had dared to buy the flaming red chiffon that she had really wanted , instead of the innocuous beige that Mrs. Bellew had encouraged her to get because it would " do for any occasion . " But the red dress would have given her away . When she had started to try it on , a sort of uprising of her old self-distrust and longing to be hidden had overwhelmed the faint new audacity . Jane looked so odd and different that it was exciting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they powdered their noses at the shaky dresser , Jane with an old powder puff that was soggy pink , they felt that they were both New Yorkers and secure in their superiority to Belmond . " You 've cut your hair ! It 's swell . But I remember those great long braids you used to have . You could sit on your hair . All the girls used to talk about that . Margaret Ferguson can sit on her braids . ' " " Makes me sound like a hen or goose or something ! " " Oh , I thought they were grand ! I used to stare at them inP352school and wish I could have hair as long as that . You had the ribbon braided into the ends  --  a red ribbon . " " Do you remember that ? " " Oh , you do n't know how I used to adore you ! " Jane 's eyes were staring and hazel-bright as she said all this in her breathless little voice that seemed always just about to break into some gloriously exciting news . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did too , because it was n't curly like Dorothy 's . " " Who was Dorothy ? " " Oh , do n't you remember ? My pretty little sister ? " " Did you have a sister ? I do n't remember anyone but you . " " Goodness ! Nobody else would say that . " " Oh , I 've never forgotten your eyes or your hair . I always thought , if I could just have eyes like Margaret Ferguson 's , instead of crazy ones like mine , I would n't ask for anything more . Do n't you remember how I used to stick around , awful little brat , when Irene tried to chase me away , because I just could n't stop looking at you ! " " How disappointed you must be now . " " Oh ! " Jane made a horrified round of her lips . " JANE ! " Jane said hastily , " We 've got to go back to the party . " She squeezed Margaret 's hand again . " I invited Dr. Finkbein becauseof you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't here  --  my roommate . They sent her to Trenton . She 's got a job . We 've had an awful fight . I do n't want you to like Stella ! " She pressed Margaret 's arm childishly . " They 're all just crazy to meet you . I told them how grand you are . " Margaret 's cheeks were stained with the clear rose-red that came only when she was excited ; and she could feel , in a vivid rush , the same dashing boldness that once in a while used to make the other children in awe of her , and that she had always felt was really herself , breaking through the cold restraint of her self-distrust and thorny , fastidious reserve . " Here 's Margaret Ferguson ! " Jane made the announcement with naive triumph . Her thinP353hand with its childishly cold finger tips was still clinging to Margaret 's . The small room was dense with smoke . The men were standing , and the girls , seated , were looking up with an instant , cold , feminine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men had a beard . Margaret supposed he must be the " wonderful " Dr. Somebody . A youth said nonchalantly , " Hello , Margaret Ferguson . " He was sitting on the floor with his head against a girl 's knees . He had silky side-burns and a petulant small mouth , and he wore an orange silk shirt . " Get up , Rod , " Jane begged . " I wo n't let you meet Margaretif you do n't ! " " Well , I know who she is already . She 's Margaret Ferguson , is n't she ? I like your eyes , Margaret ! " The others laughed scornfully at Rod , and yet they seemed to approve his debonair insolence . He closed his eyes languidly , and settled his head against the girl 's knees . His long lashes curled like flowers beneath the childish purity of the white lids . But all these people were different . The girl who supported Rod wore a red peasant dress with bright embroidery . Margaret always felt jealous of any girl who wore red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl had on a black evening dress . She had blond hair , and looked like Mildred Summers , and Margaret instantly hated her . It disappointed Margaret that the men seemed to be inferior in looks to the girls . At first Margaret was mute . The couch was so wide that her feet felt funny and stiff sticking out beyond it . The furniture was disarmingly childish , like Jane herself , in its foolish pretty cheapness and inadequacy . Most of the people sat on the floor . There were two wicker chairs , one painted in streaky black and one in green , that squeaked when anyone moved . A dormer window , opening like a casement , was set in under two slopes of ceiling like those modern paintings done in geometricblocks . The room was at the top of the house . Margaretimagined herself crouching at such a window at twi-P354ight , looking across the dark , narrow , little tucked-in street , and thinking of a love affair that had ended in sorrow . A little man with fluffy hair was bringing drinks . Margaret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted to cover her excitement and uncertainty . Once Frank had given Sybil a bottle of port , to " give her strength " when she was getting over a cold ; and every night before they went to bed , the two girls had made a deliciously private rite of solemnly clinking and sipping from two small ten-cent-store glasses . " I drink to Frank Gesell . " " I drink to Red McGafferty . " He was that boy on the Hanging Rock football team  --  the only male interest that Margaret had been able to dig up . But anyway , that was better than never having tasted liquor before . Secretly fearful , Margaret sipped the stinging , bad , orangecoloredconcoction . The people all joked about the drinks and made a great deal of them . One man was a little stewed . Margaretremembered the disgraceful fact that Grandpa Ferguson had been a Prohibitionist . He had voted with the party for years , saying " they 'd get a man in the White House yet . " Margaretfelt a burning tingle in her throat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being submerged under a heady gaiety . The apartment looked beautiful . All at once she could talk to people . The little fluffy-haired man had come up with Jane . " So you two damsels used to know each other in earlier days ? " Jane was plaintive . " Just sort of knew each other , Daggie ! I used to admire Margaret Ferguson in the distance . She lived in the right part of town and I lived in the wrong part . " " You lived in the wrong part ? " Daggie repeated with gently mocking commiseration . He put his arm around Jane and rocked her consolingly . Jane laid her curly head against his shoulder and snuggled to him . The tousle of curls almost hid her eyes while her lips took on the pout of a petted woman . " How grievous that our little Jane had such a humble origin ! " " But she 's among the aristocrats now ! " Lee , the thin light-haired one , who was sitting beside the light-haired girl , said that with a scornful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @   " I want to know what sort of native village produced these two interesting young women ! " Margaret said darkly , in a rush of angry daring : " The worst place on earth ! " She had triumphed ! She was accepted . All had laughed . She had proved her right to be included in this aristocracy of exile . Margaret was dazzled by Jane 's candor about her social deficiencies . She had always jealously hidden her own defects . Uplifteddizzily , she began to say things she had never dreamed of admitting except in the painful secrecy of her own mind . " Oh , she lived in a grand house ! " Jane sighed . " Grand house . Why , you little liar . I despise our house . It 's just absolutely ordinary . That urn . You thought that was grand ! You mean that hideous old affair in our front yard ? My dad 's one idea of a work of art ! " This was the way , then , of dealing with all her guilty secrets ! Margaret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louise looked superior and was still . The wonderful Dr. Finkbein had got up from his cushion on the floor and sat down very close to her on the couch . Margaret was afraid that she would give away her innocence and inexperience . She was impressed but not attracted by his dark Jewish looks . Still , she was n't going to be judged any more by Harry and Carl . They would be out of place among people who lived in New York , and talked about music , and sex , and perversion . The wonderfulDr . Finkbein was interested  --  she could see it in the alertnessof his eyes , and feel it in his body as he pressed close to her , breathing too near her face . Now it seemed that all the old values were overturned . The things that had been held against her were her assets . When she told them that she had been fired from the Normal , she achieved her greatest success . She detested Belmond . She had hated the Normal . She loathed her name  --  Margaret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could n't bear her grandmother . It made her think of one of those horrid " womanly " women who were such liars and tried to please everybody at once . " Then why not change it ? " Daggie asked , with his gently quizzical smile of amusement . All these girls had changed theirp356names to suit their features or the dictates of the numerologists . Little Jane had some sort of cast-off appellation . " I am not a member of the worthy brotherhood of numerologists , and I must confess that my arithmetic is faulty , but I see no reason why you should not answer , hereafter , to the far more suitable and decorative title of  --  say , Margot . " Jane shrieked ecstatically . " Christen her , Daggie ! Go on , you 're good , you 're just lovely , you 're better than any priest . " Daggie solemnly sprinkled a few remaining drops of gin upon Margaret 's head . But she never , never could go back to the Bellews ' apartment . Now the gin was gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of chipped Italian pottery cups . Jane embracedMargaret , and hid her head , wailing . There was Lossie 's apartment ! Daggie had the key . Lossie had left it with him when she had got a chance to go abroad as secretary to that woman with the sandals and fillets who was going to revive the ancient arts of Greece . It was perfectly crazy ! Simply mad . Mr. and Mrs. Bellew would think that she was a criminal . She had no money and she could n't take an apartment . The folks would never send her another cent if she dropped her library course . They had enough against her already . . . . Well , then , why should n't they have everything ? It was a dare in which she could n't back down , unless she were to fail in everything from this time on . There was no use in asking the folks . They would never let her do it . Library course !  --  Lee said . Did she want to live and die a holy virgin ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was money to hold one back from the heart 's desire ? It was like those terrible , glorious moments when she had stood  --  all alone in the whole air  --  on the highest shingle pile in the lumber yard , and all the other children down below her , shouting , " You dasscnt do it ! " Margaret felt almost that old , backward , thrilling rush of air and the hard , welcome shock of the ground . The eyes of the other people were shining with the same startled , pleased , reluctant admiration she used to see in the faces of those children . Now was her moment . She could n't stop for what the folks would say . It was morep357important  --  breaking out of her old bonds , asserting herself , starting  --  than any right or wrong . But there was so much more to it than just impressing anyone ! Margaret realized that when the others had left , and she was alone in her apartment . It meant that now she had cut loose from her whole unsatisfactory past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the very floor seemed to dissolve . She would have to write to the folks , go to the Believes ' and get her things , find a job . She had just forty dollars left , and she could n't ask the folks for more  --  even if they would send it to her , of ter this . But forty dollars  --  Jane would consider that an immense amount ! It seemed pretty large to Margaret herself . She would soon be making money at some interesting job , in a bookshop or a tearoom . And even if she went on the rocks  --  actually on the rocks !  --  she had at least reached out to seize the kind of life that belonged to her . Now it was almost morning . Jane 's crowd had stayed to get the room warm for her , with all the rubbish they could scrape together for the fireplace . It had all seemed to be wild fun at the time , the most fun she had ever had , but now Margaret could scarcely remember any of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bottle of wine , and they had all drunk from the bottle to celebrate Margot 's emancipation from the career of librarian , and then taken hands and danced around the room . She could see Dr. Finkbein prancing with a serious intentness to be pagan and jolly . Everyone had seemed transformed  --  and it was so much gayer because they belonged only to this night , she did n't know who most of them were or where they had come from , except that , like herself , they were outlaws . Now she was Margot . This was her own apartment . Margaretwent softly about the room , looking at her possessions , not yet able to believe that they were hers . A crazy little laugh seemed struggling in her throat . She did n't have the complete elegance that she ultimately demanded . But these were the things that she wanted now , She had the floor , with its wide old boards roughly painted.  |p358She  had the little green table with the two candlesticks and the tipsy candles . She had the creaky wicker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her chosen books . The big old kitchen fireplace , with the soft sooty blackness , the straggle of gray ashes on top , a few warm gleams of red still softly winking . When Margot came and stood before the fireplace , in her tiptoe wandering , the crazy laugh burst from her throat and she beat her hands lightly together in a solitary ecstasy . First she lighted the two candles with the matches Daggie had left . Then she twisted some paper , as she had seen Jane do , and made the first solitary , romantic fire in her own fireplace . She felt dark and bright and wild and free ! She curved her arms in a secret dance and saw their shadows on the low wallwhirled  --  andthen stood still and gave a queer , happy moan . But dearer even than her fireplace , dearer than the candles , were the two deep basement windows set snugly , excitingly , mysteriously below the jangling noises of the narrow street . There had been rain during the night . But when Margaret finally woke up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the open windows . It was still quite dark in the basement apartment . For a long time the roar of the trucks had been making the windows shiver . The noise enveloped her in strangeness and made her feel that she was in the very midst . Margaret thought of all the dreadful things that were ahead of her . Last night 's cold gray ashes lay scattered in the fireplace , and now she had nothing else to burn . She lay huddled under someone else 's halfsoiledblankets in the little chemise she had worn all night , and she felt herself shivering in a dark ebb of fear . A narrow shaft of sunshine came suddenly through the uprightiron bars of the farther window . It brightened up the wide green window sill and a space of dark painted floor . Margaretknew then that she would go through anything rather than give up this place . She did n't dare to look in the glass as she shiveringly dressed.  |p359She  felt too dreadful in her beige georgette in the morning . Everything that she owned was at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe calling up the police ! Margaretthrust on her hat with only the barest glance at the mirror , for fear she would hate herself . Outside , she suddenly felt different . The narrow streets were streaked with rain . But sunshine kept breaking through , and then the dark streaks of wet glistened . Margaret began to feel queerly happy . She had a share now in the narrow , noisy streets  --  the hurrying people , the dark Italians in the doorways of chilly little shops with sausages hanging in the windows , the bookshop with dirty copies of Beulah and of ancient textbooks on the shelf outside , the smooth handicraft tea tables in anotherwindow , the taxi skidding and pulling up in front of the small brick house with the window boxes , while all the little kids went scattering . . . . This was the first day of her real life . From now on , she would be Margot , never Margaret any more . Breakfast had to be a kind of beautiful rite . She went hastily past the common cafes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting around the counter and bending down to gulp pale coffeefrom thick cups , the drug stores where people with jobs snatched hasty breakfasts . From now on , she was going to do what she wanted to do , not what was sensible . She chose an expensive restaurant with heavy , cream-colored , French-lookingcurtains . With an air of cool immobility , in spite of her hatred of her clothes , Margaret followed the dark stout waiter to an upholstered seat . She felt a solemn , luxurious joy in the ceremony of her late breakfast in this leisurely , upholstered place . How did she know ? This might be the last day of her life . Holding the large menu card between her hands , she languidly scanned it . Her old Ferguson thriftiness quailed . But another side of her  --  her own side , the real side  --  seemed to come alive and bright and gay at this extravagance . The blood came into her chilled hands and feet and she felt her movements growing graceful and slow to fit in with the hushed atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but when she went out to eat , shep360had to do it in the proper style . The folks were just the opposite ! When they drove to Geneva , they took along a lunch and ate it in the park , saving the price of a meal . Margaret felt above them . She felt richer . There was no one else in the place except a good-looking man with a clipped moustache absentmindedlypouring amber-brown coffee from his silver pot as he read the Times . The sun was out , brilliant , shining on the dark wet . Taxis darted under the long , sweeping , clanging roar of the elevated . Margaret felt that she could n't go and see the Bellews today . It was her day . This was her own secret celebration . Without stopping for any decision , she turned and fled toward WashingtonSquare , where she paused in the sunshine , among the bare wet trees , in the freshened air . Without thinking again , she climbed to the top of one of the green busses that after a momentbegan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue sky was narrowed by the tall buildings , and she looked down on the sauntering people with mazed eyes , as if she were fulfilling some dream . She felt crazy with happiness . Hastily she rang the bell and went down the perilous steps . She knew that she had to buy some new clothes to suit this feeling , no matter how she used up her money . The windows of the fine shops brought back the guilty shame of her poverty . It was a physical hurt  --  this craving for the tinted exquisitenessof the sheer silk stockings , the beautifully done up jars of cosmetics in their expensive colors of pink and lilac and cream . With shame , Margaret hung about the racks of reduced dresses , hating the supercilious knowledge in the eyes of salesgirls . A saleswoman came toward her , with the pretense of refinedspeech and of obsequious enthusiasm trying to belie the open secrets of her hennaed hair , white at the roots , and the deep sagging lines and under-eye puffs beneath the dry pinkand-whiteof make-up . The sight drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old enough !  --  and if she did n't have things pretty soon they would do her no good . Driven , unsatisfied , her money burning in her purse , Margaret could not stop until she had bought a black silk dress with unusualsleeves , and a red hat from a bargain counter . Evenp361then , the fever was not spent  --  not until , sick with audacity , feeling the floor drop away from her at the fatal dwindling of the bills in her handbag , she had bought rouge , geranium-red lipstick in a silver case , a package of scented cigarettes , two little wine glasses in an antique shop , and a heavy supply of tencent-storecandles . Her feet were noiseless on the carpeted softness of the Rest Room in the department store . She managed triumphantly to change into the new black dress in the cramped space of one of the toilet booths . Then she stood before the long shining mirror , detesting the critical eyes of the other women , and made up her face with the new rouge and lipstick . Everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own . Her eyes sparkled darkly under the red of the hat . She seemed to have come into possession of a light , sauntering step , and she felt that now she truly was " Margot . " She went out into the bright street . Instead of feeling poor because of her extravagance , she felt much richer . She chose a French restaurant for luncheon because it was foreign . This meal was another secret celebration . Margot slowly relished each course that she ate in her free solitude  --  the rich soup , the asparagus , the chicken . All seemed sanctified because they were French ; although the table-d'hote luncheon was not particularly good . She was aware of two men with foreign moustaches , and their presence made her hands seem whiter and her movements more graceful and significant ; although she felt the disgrace of never having had a romance in her life , and the difficulty of working up her feeling for Dr. Redmond into anything that would do . She smoked one of her new scented cigarettes , idly and gracefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ate the small pink-and-white slab of ice cream and drank the bitter coffee from the small thick cup . The meal was sumptuously complete . Still she was not ready to go back to her cold apartment and the consideration of her problems . Some part of her exuberance had not yet been given vent . She had spent all the money that she dared . There was nothing to do but go into a church . Margot felt that this was like entering religion in a book : top362open a gave , and go past a small fountain chilly with thaw , and into the silent dusky charm , heavy with the accumulated silence of old beliefs , of the low , irregular rooms of the little Anglican church on the side street . Margot had long ago decided that she did n't believe in religion . But the high church atmosphere had a romantic attraction for her , as a child of Puritan upbringing . She felt that she was treading on the edges of a mystic feeling that she could n't quite accept . She was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Things irregular , off the set pattern , little steps up or down , odd windows , hidden window seats , balconies , unexpected corners  --  these were the kind of things that made Margot feel as if she were just on the verge of being in a story . Nothing was irregular at home except the cupola on the old Spencer house . Margot walked softly down the aisle , hungrily feeding her appetite for color and difference with the sight of the white-and-gold altar , the woody smell , the cushion and candle smell , the thick silence . She solemnly knelt on a prayer bench . . . but nothing came , no answer , no more than when she looked into a glass on Halloween ; and she left the church feeling surreptitious and unsatisfied . The sun was clouded over again . It was colder , and the noondaybrilliance was gone from the streets . Margot took the bus to Washington Square . She was tired now , but only partly ' appeased . She did n't know just what to do . She stood on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overhead roar of the elevated . Someone was coming toward her . She recognized the little beard  --  it was the wonderful Dr. Finkbein ! Margot saw guiltily that in the daylight he looked like a poor professor . There was the wrinkled dreariness about him of a man who lived in a small rented room . But they greeted each other with enthusiasm . " Just the young woman I was thinking about ! Wo n't you come in somewhere for tea ? Then we can continue our very interesting conversation . " The smoke-filled room where candles flickered was like the inside of some dark shell . They took their place among the heterogeneous couples sitting on hard benches and leaning theirp363elbows on unsteady tables . Margot felt some unsatisfactory romanticpleasure in the spurious charm of the " quaint " little tearoom made over from a stable . She played with the pretense that Dr. Finkbein might be that " older man " who had come into her imagination in so many guises , and who could form and direct her . There was a sweet , insidious flattery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  like Charlotte Bronte 's heroines . It was a little difficult to sustain the idea of Dr. Finkbein in that role ; but she felt defiantly that she had to begin to live right now , with what was around her . She tried not to meet Dr. Finkbein 's earnest , empty eyes . He was nervously responsive and delighted when she asked him boldly to go back with her to her apartment . He had already clapped the admiring label of " hedonist " upon her . All day Margot had scarcely dared believe in the existence of her basement room . But there it was  --  her own  --  below the noise and the passing , with the barred windows and the little grated door down two stone steps . " I have n't any lights , " Margot said nervously . " I 'll have to unwrap my candles . " She felt Dr. Finkbein breathing too close to her . He was fumbling helplessly for the candle . Then she felt the awkward , timid earnestness of his hand on her arm . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her inexperience , Margot tried deliberately to smile . She saw his bright spectacles  --  and then his kiss fell , clumsy and fervid , on her lips . Margot pulled herself away . But at any rate she had dared ! She had made her first day end with a kiss . Why did she have to suffer humiliation just because she wanted to stay in New York and do some interesting kind of work instead of just the ordinary kind ? There was a bookshop that Margot had seen on just the kind of street that charmed her most , a piece of street that went zigzag , like going down the Crooked Street in Old Witch . On one side of the shop was an Italian grocery with funny cheeses in the window , and on the other a gift shop with Czechoslovakian " Go away ! I did n't tell anybody to come here . I want to die ! " Jane , who had been laughing , now suddenly burst into tears . " Oh , Daggie ! Oh , do n't let her ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daggie lit a match , glanced mildly about the room , and settled his eyeglasses . He stood smiling down at them with that gently admiring and quizzical air with which he regarded all womankind . Why , assuredly , he said  --  while Jane wailed  --  Margot might have the privilege of dying . It was a privilege which he believed in extending  --  among many others  --  to all the human race . But he must remark that she would then pass to the great beyond with the honor of being the first hungry damsel who had ever turned down the offer of a meal from him . " Jane , here , comes and suggests them herself ! " Jane made a face at him , and rubbed her cheek against his arm . He sat down on the couch beside her . " Being a philosopher , " he remarked , " you must permit a few philosophical observations . Even in the presence of contemplateddeath . " Jane moaned and buried her curly head against his shoulder . He patted the curls . " Which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after all is said and done . " Margot kept her face determinedly buried . With one hand Daggie stroked Jane 's curls , with the other held Margot 's wrist . His soft voice flowed on , never varying its mildly philosophicaltone , and in the dim light from the basement windows his fluffy aureole of hair was comfortingly visible . In the first place , he gathered , without too great a strain upon original observation , that the damsel who now chose to be called Margot Ferguson ( having been gifted by Christian parents with the rather too well-worn name of Margaret ) found herself in a situation far more common to members of the humanrace than she imagined . The circumstances , briefly , were these : no heat , no food , no lights . And to judge from the wrist which he was now holding ( not entirely without pleasure to himself ) the situation had been of some duration . His first suggestion was dinner  --  again , not without some reference to himself . A slight plumpening increase would make the wristp367even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not been well received . Strange ! For in innumerable instances , some of them close at hand  --  Jane slapped him , and then hugged Margot  --  ithad been used to meeting with instantaneous approval . The reason for this was  --  pride . An estimable quality , but in the present instance , misplaced . For pride in regard to " what ye shall eat and what ye shall drink " was according to scripture a characteristic of the Philistine . Consider , not the lilies of the field which were not available , but little Jane ! Did she take heed as to what she should eat and what she should drink ? Nay ! And it was given unto her . Jane struck him with her small fist . Daggie captured the fist gently . The trouble with Margot Ferguson was that she was still acting the part of the no doubt far more estimable but far less interesting Margaret ! " Let me , " said Daggie , offering cigarettes , " paint a wordpictureof the Ferguson household of Belmond , Kansas or thereabouts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperous household , even grand ! Upon the spacious lawn stands a dignifiedurn of some cemeterial plaster resembling marble , from which vines trail in a graceful manner . " Margot gave a smothered sound of tremulous laughter . " Say it is noon . The whistle  --  town has a whistle , of course ?  --  has blown . From the kitchen where Mrs. Ferguson , a respectablelady of gracious proportions , is bustling , comes an enticingodor of beefsteak to procure which many also graciously proportioned creatures are annually slaughtered in Kansas . Potatoes are boiling merrily in the kettle , while the garden  --  where Mr. Ferguson takes his evening recreation with the hoe  --  displays a highly vitamized array of peas , beans , squash and rutabaga . This is the meal to which Mr. Ferguson , a fine old gentleman with the moustaches usually described by the term walrus , ' is wont daily to sit down , after due attention to the blessing , with an excellent appetite . " " Dad does n't have walrus moustaches ! " " Ah ! Smooth-shaven . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time Margot Ferguson has not known the meaning of thep368phrase to be hungry . ' She invests it therefore with far more significance than the term deserves . " A little help ? Why should she mind it ? Consider the youth Bobbie , or the youth Rod  --  lilies truly . Bobbie , who held that plaid knickers marked the artist , and so attired was sharing the excellent bed and board of the ever-generous Marta , ousting  --  Daggie was sorry to remark  --  the little female Jane . Unless he , Daggie , was misinformed , Margot herself had accepted an invitation to tea from a learned and serious-minded gentleman of his acquaintance . " Oh ! " Jane breathed . " Dr. Finkbein thinks you 're won-der-ful ! " No job ? Jobs came and went . Little Jane could tell her that . It was the private life that mattered . And she , with her interestingconquest of a learned gentleman , was just beginning her private life . Margot let herself be dislodged from the blankets . Jane , still with moans of sympathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if she were tending her doll . Daggie , smiling , watched them , and flicked the ashes from his cigarette . He had found and lit the stump of a candle . The others , he said admiringly , she must have consumed , like the lost children in Toni Sawyer . But tallow as a diet , although its literary backing might be excellent , was hardly sufficient . Tony would supply more plumpening fare . " So let us on to Tony 's . " Daggie and Jane marched her down the street between them . Margot felt strangely weak and cleansed . It was as if the winterrain that was falling had swept away the old accumulation of grievances , leaving only this wet blackness that sent up fragrance into her heart . All the lights had rainbow haloes . They went down into another basement and rang the bell at another grilled door . The deliciousness of the steamy smell of food and tobacco that came through the noisy chatter made her head swim with hungry ecstasy . It was like coming back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white mantel . They were more beautiful than if they had been real . The thick brown soup sent up an intoxicating steam . The crusty Italianp369bread and the unsalted butter were more delicious than the image of the bread and jug of wine beneath the bough which she had once thought so enticing in the Rubaiyat . The bright , noisy , basement room was a refuge for difference , a sanctuary for the exiles from homes both too good and too bad . It was home , now . Even after Jane and Daggie had left her , Margot could n't go straight to bed . She crouched beside her beautiful fire on a little red-painted stool . How lovely her room was now , how changed and mysterious !  --  the softly flaming tips of the red candles that Daggie had bought her , the big unsteady shadows on the walls . " Here today and gone tomorrow . " The words whispered themselves with a mysterious consolation . The red wine , the firelight , the candles . . . Margot sprang up to get her red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep this happiness from slipping away . Coming home radiant , amazed , Margot could n't believe what had happened ! And just as casually ! She had seen a funny little tearoom , in a crazy little place not much bigger than a passageway ; thought , " Shall I ? "  --  and walked boldly in ; said " Do you need anyone to help you ? "  --  and the woman . in the pink smock , looking up with mildly distracted , wide-apart , gray eyes , had answered , with a trail of Southern inflection : " Yes , I reckon I might ! " Now the story of herself was beginning to come true . She was in her own basement apartment , and she was going to work in a Village tearoom . Margot stepped lightly about the room washing off the blackpaintedtabletops , feeling gay and artistic in her yellow smock , humming as she worked . She went into the kitchen to get the lunch cloths out of the tipsy black-painted chest of drawers . She loved even the kitchen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread out from the ancient range where they had things cooking in big kettles that might have come out of a folk tale . She simply adored their huge old coffeepot.  |p370She  spread the yellow cloths on the black tabletops . They were of cotton crepe with fringed edges . They had been her own idea . Mary Lou had let her paint the furniture black . " Mary Lou ! " " What , honey ? " " I just had a swell idea ! " Mary Lou came to the kitchen door with her hands floury . " Oh , no  --  I do n't know  --  maybe it is n't . Go on back . " Mary Lou went back into the kitchen obediently . How queer it was ! Margot thought  --  this sort of power she seemed to have over worshiping older women . They seemed to belong mysteriouslyto her guiding star . Mary Lou 's fondness was half childish and half maternal . It was even worse than Vanchietheutter round-eyed , trustful admiration with which she acceptedall of Margot 's ideas ! " I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now came something that every day she simply loved to do . It was to go to their big old crooked cupboard in the kitchen and get out the dishes . They did n't match . She did n't want them to match . Margot and Mary Lou had picked out every one separately . She saved until the last , with sensuous pleasure , the two thick yellowish plates and cups of Spanish pottery . She was going to keep them for the little table where she and Lee would sit . If Lee came in today ! Never would she get over her joy in this tiny , tucked-in , unexpected , folk-tale place ! Daggie said it had been a hangoutfor a bunch of Italian gamblers . Margot hoped that was true . The kitchen floor was crooked . You went down one little step . Nobody but Mary Lou could have done such cooking on the ancient range . She hugged Mary Lou . " What 's the mattuh ? " " Nothing ! I just thought about our breakfast . " " Honey , tomorrow I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daggie laughed at them with his gently philosophical pessimism . One wild woman and one addle-pated !  --  he said . Butall the crowd were reveling in Mary Lou 's expansive maternalcare . Bobbie had driven them away from Marta 's . Mary Loup371had the money from the estate back home . All her life she had wanted a tearoom . Now she had a tearoom . Why think beyond that ? Every morning , they both got up late and came over to The Hole , and Mary Lou cooked a leisurely , luxurious breakfast which they ate at the kitchen table beside the warm stove . They had their own little special granite coffeepot . They used the Spanish pottery . " Honey , what shall we have for dinner ? " " Oh , anything good . " " I might have another ham with cloves . Jane likes that . I want to put some flesh on that child 's bones . Her little hands make me think of the canary bird 's claws my old Aunt Nancy had . She was a little bit queer  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything but that skinny old canary . " An atmosphere of Southern laxity and warmth and ease seemed to emanate from Mary Lou plump and flushed at the kitchen range . She had a helpless maternal softness . Yet in the clarity of her round gray eyes there was something virginal . All those years when she had been keeping house for " papa , " she had been dreaming of a tearoom of her own . If she had thought about men , it was only shyly , as a little girl might think while she played with her tea set and dolls . But she had taken the crowd for her children . " Oh , my only precious ! Where is he ? How could his mother forget him ? " With her voice drenched in pity , eyes wide in compassionatehorror , Margot swooped down upon the scrap of kitten asleep beneath the stove . Its black fur was brown with dust . Margot brushed it rigorously . She held the little creature up against her cheek to feel its ecstatic purr . She had found it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Starving and crouchingon the edges , just as she herself used to do . It was as if her own little lost cat , the one that Carl 's dog had killed years ago , had been given back to her . She was finding all that she had lost . It was a kind of symbol . A little black cat !  --  to wind in and out among the black table legs with lifted tail , to sleep curled up on a yellow cushion , to lap its milk while theyp372drank their coffee  --  a kitten 's lapping and purring , the final sounds of luxury ! Now Margot could close her eyes to the other frozen , skinny felines nosing the sorry garbage cans of the Village . You are n't going to starve , you little black one , " she told it passionately . " Margot has you . You 're my kitty . You 're saved . " With a glance of defiance at Mary Lou 's back , she poured out a bit of coffee cream into her yellow saucer and screened the kitten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and little furry neck outstretched . " Now , little blackest , you can go to sleep . " They did n't have many people for lunch . Mary Lou did n't want many . She did n't like to work her head off for strangers , she said . The crowd all came for dinner . But it was an excitementevery day to see what people might drift in . Once a Villagesightseeing party had come . " Is n't this quaint ! Is n't it the quaintest place . " Margot , as she went out to the kitchen with orders , made whispered reports of the diners to Mary Lou . Those they did n't like the looks of , they gave the homeliest dishes and the poorest pieces of meat . " That old buzzard again ? Here 's this piece of fat . It 'll be good enough for her . Honey , I like that boy with the glasses . Poor boy ! He looks so thin . If he comes in again , you can ask him if he wants a second cup . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Hello , Princess of Darkness ! " Lee had come in again . He dropped in nearly every day for lunch now . Louise did n't know it . He was sitting at their own little corner table . " Come on and sit down , and let 's have our grouch out on the world . " Margot sat down , propped her elbows on the table , accepted a cigarette . " This is Princess 's black cat ? " " Oh , Lee ! If you are n't nice to him you ca n't stay here.  |p373Mary  Lou 's afraid of him . She thinks he 's going to bring bad fortune . " " Sure . We Southerners are all afraid of signs . All sunk in superstition . I 'm scared myself . " " My precious ! " Margot moaned . She took the little cat . " You do n't want to let Louise see this cat here ! " " Why not ? " Margot belligerently demanded . " She yells if she sees one . Got one of those complexes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to chase out my kitten just to suit her complexes ! " Margot buried her face in the softness of brown-black fur . " My little dark angel , little blackness , I adore you . I do n't care , I do ! " she said , coming up , and glaring defiantly at Lee . " I do n't doubt it . You give every evidence . Does n't Mary Lou think you 're a witch ? " " No . She thinks I 'm just lovely . " " Has n't heard you go on about your grouches . Margot : Prejudices : Seventy-seventh Volume . It 'd be Louise 's grouch today if she knew where I was ! " " Oh , I wish you would n't everlastingly keep bringing in Louise ! " " You two girls do n't like each other very well , do you ? " Lee asked , curious and excited . " What 's the trouble ? Been quarreling over my attentions ? " " Your attentions ! I 've never had any of your attentions . " Lee said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Margot looked at him witheringly . But she felt the exciting pleasure of sitting here with him talking inanities , beneath which there seemed always to be hidden significance . His knee pressed hers under the table . His thin hand , with the forefingerstained deep orange , strayed , as if by accident , towards hers . There was an attraction between them , half reluctant and jeering , but more than she had felt for any man since Frank Gesell . Daggie was nicer than Lee . But she did n't count Daggie or Dr. Finkbein as men exactly , since she could n't have fallen in love with either of them . She did n't know whether she liked Lee , but there was a give-and-take between them . Be/sides , she liked to beat out Louise . Louise would be the one to grab the best-looking man in the crowd ! " Margot , tell me , what has been your love life ? Ever have any fellow but me ? " " You , " Margot said witheringly . " What did you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh  --  went home with boys from the Young People 's meet-ing . " " Was there a line-up outside the church ? God , do n't I rememberthose line-ups ! The church stag line . I was raised in the Baptist faith . Somebody always got away with the best girls , left me walking home alone . No wonder I took to the pool room . I never had any luck in love . Do n't have any more . Unless you 're going to be good to me ? " " I suppose you were in love with someone like Louise ! " Lee settled himself with relish . " Why do n't you like Louise ? " Margot refused to answer . " If she knew where I was at this moment ! She hates you . She 's afraid of you . You two girls are the great antithesis , are n't you ? That 's why I have to seek you out . You 're my only antidote . Darkness and light . Tempest and sunshine . I told Louise to go and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Women . And well he ought to know ! Must have been favored with plenty of it . Until Margot was kind . You do n't need any lecture , Margot , beyond what I could give you . Want to hear mine ? " " I do n't care to be an antidote ! " " They cure , " Lee told her meaningly . " No , merely neutralize . " " God ! Even that would be something . I never could make a hit with a girl like Louise . That 's why I always run after them . One of those who always love what they ca n't have . Look here , if you want to see what a fool I am . " " I know anyway , but I 'd just as soon have the confirma-tion . " He emptied out his pocket on the table . Margot laughed atp375the litter . But she felt a little thrill of excitement when she touched the things , all bitter-scented from the squashed package of cigarettes . Lee rooted about until he brought out a soiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to know the worst . " Margot read incredulously . She felt a jealous fury at the thought of such words being applied to Louise . " She is all so slightAnd tender and white  --  " " Louise is n't  --  if you mean her . I 'd call her quite fat . " Margotscornfully thrust out her own slender dark arm . Lee took it , and bent back the slim , smooth , flexible thumbs . His hand crept up the wrist . Margot felt the stealthy pressure of his fingers . She jerked her arm away . " I just do n't see the application , " she said disdainfully . " She is as goldLovely , and far more cold . That 's the truth , too ! For if I win graceTo kiss twice her faceAnd that 's about all I 've got for two years ' straight devotion ! Well , not much more than that , when you come down to essen-tials . " He stared at the litter on the table , then swept it back into his pocket . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That applies anyway . Well , that 's the only difference there is between girls . Some get hot and messy and some stay always cool . That girl 's body is always fresh and cool . Not that I ever had much chance with Louise 's body ! She looks to that . She 's the only virgin in the crowd . Unless you 're one . Are you , Margot ? " She refused haughtily to answer . " I would n't answer for you . I do n't know , though . " He reached out and turned her face up toward his , with his finger under her chin.  |p378ce|pted  them , because she was n't going to hide away any longer from any kind of experience . Margot threw her red notebook against the wall in disgust . The crowd came to The Hole for dinner . Of course Louise had to be here !  --  sitting beside Lee , silky and cool , scarcely glancing at the other girls . Jane and Mary Phipps and Lenore hated Louise because she was only playing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she let everyone know that she came from a wealthy family . Louise let out a scream . The little cat , perking up spirit to be playful , had touched her shoe with its paw . " Lee  --  somebody  --  take it away ! Oh , I hate the damned things ! Scat ! " Margot swooped down furiously upon the little cat and bore it off to the kitchen . " Lee does n't hate it . " Margot 's voice was hard . " He held it on his lap this noon . " She saw with triumph the look that shot from Louise 's eyes . Well , let her know that Lee had been here without her ! Louise thought she need n't bother to be a rival to a little bit of riffraff like Jane . But she had to reckon with Margot , and she knew it ! And Margot felt with malicious triumph that this was her place . The black tables and chairs , the color of the dishes , even the darkness of the night were on her side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tearoom again if I have to have alley cats crawling over my feet , as well as  --  " Louise gave an expressive glance at Lenore and Jane across the table . " It 's rather hard on Mary Lou ! " Jane hopped joyously into the fray . " I think the little cat 's darling . Bring it in , Margot . I 'm goingto let it eat off my plate . " Daggie spread a gentle , deterring hand . " I 'll protect you from the beast , Louise . " He lifted the kitten from Jane 's plate . " Oh , never mind , " Louise said with cutting distaste . " No doubt they 're accustomed to keeping the pig in the parlor . " " Oh , yes , we were ! " Jane cried , in ingenuous delight . " I had the dearest little pig  --  "  | " Sh , sh ! " " With a little curly tail  --  " Daggie put his hand over her mouth . She struggled , wildly laughing . " And the sweetest rat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table with dignity . Well , let her sit like an outraged queen , saying her dinner was completely spoiled ! This was the night when it got nothing for her . She still kept the notions of the petted small town beauty , who expected that things would be done for her , not that she would ever do anything . Now the tables were turned . " Children , children , " Daggie expostulated . " Do n't spoil the party . " When they left the subway and came out into Wall Street , Margot tore her arm away from Dr. Finkbein 's and ran off alone down the empty street . She did n't want to hear about capital and labor and the class struggle tonight . In his awkward , earnest fatuousness , he would never forget the promise of that kiss ! Well , it was everyone for himself . It had to be . The tall buildings narrowed and towered on each side , filling Margot with a hard , exultant sense of power . The voices echoed weirdly in the cold , dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between these towering walls ! There was a ruthless power here that cared nothing for them and would crush their tiny lives out of them without mercy . But at night-time they could play about these stony fortresses . There was some kind of gleeful revenge in that ! They could have their own lives while the world was going ponderously on  --  in the interstices of time and place , here in this uncharted hour of night-time . They were the outlaws . Margot dashed up into a stony doorway and stood for a moment , panting , feeling queerly alone and sorrowful . She pressed her cheek against a cold stone pillar . She had got away from Dr. Finkbein at last . Footsteps beat lightly up the stone steps . Margot stood in rigid wariness . Now her heart began to beat thickly . Lee pulled her out roughly from behind the pillar.  | " Here , none of that ! You ran off to be chased , did n't you ? " The likeness between his thin , bitter hardness and her taut rebellion quivered in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attraction . " And their lips met ! " Lee said dramatically . Now the others had discovered that they were missing . They heard the jeering voices from the street . " It 's the moonlight ! " Daggie said . But with his usual philosophic air of a quizzically and affectionatelyamused onlooker , Daggie would do nothing to check the catastrophe that was overtaking his walking party . He watched it come , as he might have stood at a window to watch a cyclone approaching . " I want Margot to walk with us , " Jane whimpered . " Do n't check the mating fever . Be content with your loving Daggie . " In this cold canyon between the huge buildings , where the moonlight made sharp cubes of white among the shadows , it was natural to be cruel and fierce . The fight was on between Margot and Louise . Margot felt that it was something that had been ordained since the beginning of time . The figure of Louise , in the soft gray coat with the soft gray fur , the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn into itself everything that was hostile . Margot fantastically piled her hatreds upon it . It was the gray and white kitten that Dorothy had chosen , that all the girls had cuddled because it was so soft , leaving out the little black one . . . all the smooth Eve women , masking their shrewd maneuvers beneath their softness . . . for the first time Margot gave herself up with wild joy to the white blaze of her jealousy . Daggie led his flock into a corner shack for hot dogs and coffee . Louise was walking close to Lee again , silently , demurely . A pang of hot anger shot through Margot . It brought the power of her insolence , sharp and bright . She pushed past Louise , and grabbed Lee 's arm ; and then , from her perch on the stool at the counter , looked back with hard triumph at Louise 's furious , defeated face . " Lee asked me to be his girl tonight ! " Louisep381could n't take defeat straight . She was outraged . She thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Let ' cm alone , " Daggie said . He threw up his hands . Margot 's legs were trembling . She felt a wild desire to cry , in the perilous remorse of victory . But the smooth Eves were n't going to have everything forever ! They had their weapons  --  their selfish deftness , their yielding softness that masked as sympathy and flattery  --  but they had nothing to match her insolence . Because she dared ! She would give everything she had for what she wanted . Louise sat baffled and crying in her inability to go the whole way . Her care for what she would gain was less than her fear of what she might lose . Well , they got the soft places , the fearful ones ! But Louise could n't have this cold , bright moonlight . The rest of the night was a kind of hectic scattering . They all stood shivering near the cold harbor . Then there was the hollow , softened thudding of their feet on the wooden platform as they hurried onto the ferry . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch of spring . A mist of spray touched their faces as the boat swung out , carrying them across the dark swell of water . Now Louise was trying for consolation and support against Margot . She was making the others pity and surround her . But Margot was the one who was in league with this night . Beneath the necessity for her triumph , Margot felt a darkness , a queer fatality . Here at the ferry railing , with the heaving black brightness all around them , the hostility between herself and Lee was yielding to the perverse thrill of their likeness . They were standing against Louise together . The fascination each felt for each  --  thin , sharp , too personal  --  was straining to defeat , by its own assertion , all that made up their bitterness and loneliness , from long , long ago . They were off the boat and all crowding into the taxi . Jane was wickedly glad that Margot was winning . She burst into wild fits of giggles that Daggie tried mildly to subdue . Louise sat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hers , they felt alike . She had made him admit her , assert that likeness , admit that here she was the choice  --  notp382Louise , stealthily invading even this place where she did n't belongand that she could n't live up to . " I 'm going home with you . Do you know it ? " Lee challenged her . " Louise 'll never forgive me for this . " " Never forgive you ! " Margot said scornfully . " She 'll love you . " They stood shivering on the dark pavement while Lee paid his share of the taxi . It seemed to Margot that she was tremblingon the very edge of the world . But she was n't afraid  --  she would n't turn back now . This had to be . She fitted her key into the lock of the grilled basement door . They went into the cold room . " You know I have n't any lights . " She heard Lee laugh . " You girls are all alike , are n't you ? " " I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others saw her as insolent , predatory , triumphant . They did n't know that inside she was frightened and trembling , wildly at bay before all the establishedcanons of the world . What she felt was a kind of dedication . Yes , a dedication to her own way of life ! Lee put his arms around her , and the unlighted candle fell bumping to the floor . " You little mad Indian . " There was a note of hard , admiring hatred in his voice . But the hatred was joy . Or almost joy . Again she felt that it had to be like this . Something within her was weeping , was helplessly protesting . But she fought blindly against the protest , to force out of their bitter likeness rapture enough to hold against Louise  --  against the world . Margot went out into the street . The world ought to be made new . She was changed now . She was a woman of experience . Christopher Street roared with its narrow confusion . It was dark in the rainy morning . Margot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the noise , the traffic , the people , the skidding cars and lumbering old truck wagons with the heavy feet of horses slipping on the gleaming wet . Battered tin ash cans stood out in front of tenement houses . The same poor skinny cats were nosing . She was on an equality now withp383the heavy Italian women with the dark shawls over their heads . She need no longer bow to what mother and Aunt Louie and Aunt Ella and all the others said . It seemed to her that a mysterious ripening had come over her slight body . Lying in the cot , alone this morning , just wakening out of a final deep oblivion , she had felt a curious upper sense of fulfillment and ripening  --  with underneath , something crying , fatal and lost . But it was done . At last she was entirely at home in her basement room . She went into The Hole . Through the crooked doorway of the kitchen , she saw Mary Lou 's unconscious figure . " Honey , what happened to you ? You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind ? I saved some things for you . " Did Mary Lou know that she was changed ? There was no knowledge in the round , innocent clarity of those virginal gray eyes . Margot felt a shiver of loneliness . It would never be the same again , eating breakfast here with Mary Lou . She would never again have quite the old , unconscious wholeness . She held the little cat with its whiskers and fur pressed up against her cheek . " Little black one . You 're my little black one . " Her eyelashes were wet . " Honey , I 'm goin ' out to buy a few things . " Under her calm , now , there was a restlessness . It was rising and taking possession of her . Margot got up from her breakfast . She stared into the wavy little mirror beside the cupboard . The coaly brightness of the pupils widened and made her eyes all black . She thought , with a fierce defiant joy , she was really an outlaw . The folks would repudiate her forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lance , wrecked her " virtue , " set herself beyond the pale . She was glad ! She caught up the little cat again . They were both black ones . It was a queer , solitary , exhilarating feeling  --  as if she were some kind of dark , bright meteor shooting dangerously across the safe , settled , complacent orbits of the fixed stars . . . . People began to come in for lunch . Margot felt a curious lack of interest . They were people , that was all . There was one of those parties of sightseers . Margot went in to serve them with a cool , contemptuous assurance . But she had the dramaticp384feeling of herself , slim and different in her yellow smock , with a dangle of gypsy earrings beneath her short black hair . " Do you suppose she 's foreign ? " one of the women whispered , half shocked and half admiring . There was no reason to be diffident with the large , handsome married woman , dressed in inconspicuous expensiveness , with the old-fashioned diamond solitaire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her plump left hand . Her kind of self-assurance came from having known only the tame , admitted things . In a place like this , she was superior but uneasy . Margot could recognize the high , hungry animation , the restless , shut-out ignorance in the seeking eyes of the thin , unattractive , well-dressed woman , just getting to the point when her unclaimed solitude began to seem hopeless to her . She was the kind of woman who felt exhilarated and flattered in Rod 's little shop , up one flight of dark stairs , on the narrowest street , watching him handle with delicate fingers some little blue Chinesevase , while he explained its beauties , with a glint of callow , cold , dark disdain in his almond eyes . Ladies who thought Rod was such a beautiful boy ! The thin woman giggled with nervous delight at having dared to come to such a dangerous place as this . Lee did n't come in to lunch today . Margot was glad . But it left everything flat . The rasped , angry solitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a headache , " she told Mary Lou . " I 'm going home . " It was the same as all other days , only more so , as she fitted her key into the lock of the grilled door , sidestepping the scatteringof rubbish the garbage collectors had left when they emptied their cans with noisy carelessness . The cold stale silence of her room surrounded her . The memory of the night before lingered in it like the events of a dream , so vivid that  --  unreal all the same !  --  it lasts over into the morning . What was there to do with herself ? What use to light the candles  --  gloat over the fire , alone ? " There was a time when I was sad and lonely , And stood in strange forgetfulness apart . "  |p305Was  she " lonely for her loneliness " now ? She could never go back . The torn-in-two , crying ache of this new solitude had to be assuaged  --  but never again by that old , rapt solitude . The icy glaze of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved Lee or hated him  --  whether it was happiness or misery  --  it was nothing to be here without him now . Slowly a strange depression came up from depths below all her other feelings and settled darkly over her . She did n't take it back . She wanted to want him  --  in spite of the trembling , new humiliation of finding that another human being might be necessary to her . She felt that she had to go on to the end that she could almost see . But in everything that she did , there was always a flaw , something fragmentary and broken . It seemed as if she had only used herself to triumph over herself . She wanted to cry . But there were n't any tears . Perfection was still beyond her . She was furious at her own desires , hurting herself upon the memory of imperfection , but wanting even that more than the old enclosed unreality of a dream . Grimmie asked , " Do you really mind if I go off , Margot precious ? " " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I hate to leave you alone . With those big dark eyes ! " Margot hooted . But as she sat tucked among the velvet cushions , with the book of H. D. 's poems , the Armenian cigarettes beside her , candied violets in the Chinese bowl on the lacquered stand , she felt lapped in the warmth of Grimmie 's generosity ; and the dark misery that still stayed , like a cold spring flowing underground , made the contrast of her comfort all the more dramatic . " Sweetheart , are you warm enough ? There 's plenty of coal in that sack in the do-diddy . Do n't warm up that old stuff in the kitchenette . Go out and get a good dinner when you 're hungry . I want to fill out those thin little cheeks . H. D. ! Oh , is n't she glorious ? She simply made Greek poetry live for me . Then swam a new planet into my ken '  --  or anyway . . . you know . Good-bye , dearest , I have to fly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brass hod , looked around for cigarettes , kissed Margot  --  she was finally gone , with the orange wool hat that she had bought enthusiasticallyin a new Czechoslovakian shop ( it was going to bring the zsthetic element into modern dress ) tilted wildly over one ear , and a streamer of fuzzy hair flying . The way Grimmie always made her departures ! Coal slipped in the fireplace . A few sparks scattered . Black satin mules had been kicked idly under a chair . The wintergreenbranches in the big black bowl had dripped red berries on the white mantel . Books lay all around behind cushions and sticking out from chair backs . The luxury of books , more books than she could ever read ! Ash trays everywhere . The ash trays at Grimmie 's were always full . From the signed photographs of Grimmie 's friends , hanging crooked on the white-paneled walls  --  writers with pipes , artists with and without beards , strike leaders with tossed tumultuous hair , the " interesting people " of whom Margot used to dream  --  she drew again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shut-in life in the basements of the Village was far away . Her room stayed as she had left it , chill and stale with old fires and cigarette smoke , when she had walked out blind with misery . The paintings that Grimmie had bought from future geniuses were striking , some of them , and some of them just crazy ; but it was nice to look at them from half-closed eyes whenever she stopped reading for a moment . The one of the cypress tree on the Pacific coast , battered and twisted by the winds into a shape that had a meaning  --  none of Grimmie 's friends got excitedabout that one , but Margot did n't care , for it was hers . It justified her own way of existence . And then the faded old brownish photograph of Grimmie 's home , somewhere in Missouri , with all the family drawn up in front of a white frame house with pillars , remotely colonial , under big trees . . . in that was the comforting sense of old ties , distant but unbroken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Greek atmosphere of the verses , a faint timeless scent of hyacinths drifted through the pleasantly smoky atmosphere of the whitepaneledroom with its glowing fire , up above the small seclu/sion of Bank Street , with the noise coming muffled from Seventh Avenue . Here she was under the adoring protection of an older woman again ! This was another way-station of her destiny . But she had to rest a while in the luxury of this feminine lavishness . The desperate impulse had been right that had sent her out at last to find Grimmie 's address . Grimmie was more her mother than her own mother , than mama , was  --  just as once she had felt that Frank Gesell was more her father than dad . Grimmie 's headlong kindness and understanding had slowly soothed the rankling wound of Mary Lou 's defection . Yet Margot felt that she would never forget that , nor the shock of its surprise . Even now she had to go back and live again in that moment when Mary Lou had come into the tearoom to face her with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I ca n't keep it back any longer . I 've got to tell you . I do n't guess we can work together any more . I do n't believe in what you 're doin ' . I think it 's wrong . " But did n't Mary Lou know me ? Did n't she care about myself ? To me , her inexperience was just as wrong as my experience was to her . But I loved her for what she was behind her life . Why could n't she have seen me behind my life ? Mary Lou had wept . She could n't explain it . She would n't keep The Hole any longer . She had gone back on the crowd . Her little spurt of adventure was over . She had retreated into the innocence which was , after all , her only possession . Yes , perhaps it was her quality . And without it she would be commonplace . But Grimmie was better than Mary Lou ! All people who had made mistakes and put themselves on the other side were truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grimmie'smistakes were only carelessness , and generosity , and that sort of " unfeminine " awkwardness that had worried her family and made her an exile , having a dangle of petticoat trailing , her things all pinned together . Her being on the other side was just a passionate , haphazard espousing of the cause of anythingunfortunate . Margot adored Grimmie for the recklessness of her generosity . Maybe it was foolish , and solved nothing , and laid up trouble for other people in the end , as Katherinep388Griswold said . But it was better , all the same , than prudence , and she would always , always say that it was ! There was comfort , also , in the false security of the folks ' approval . Grimmie had written Ethel Spencer that " Margaret " was living with her . Margot had to try and keep Grimmie from writing to the folks themselves , ashamed because they would never be able to credit or comprehend the reckless innocenceof Grimmie 's views . Grimmie backed Margot up in refusing to do the regulation things that had nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiastic plans in the offing . She was sure that her friend Hjelmer Jonsen could find a place for Margot on an archaeological expedition ; or that one of the rich women she had known off and on from her excursionsinto philanthropy , some of those women who had " favoritecharities " and sold their best photographs to advertise cold creams , would set Margot up in an art shop . Meanwhile , Margot had to try and calm what Daggie called " the middle-class scruples of the estimable Ferguson family , " and Dr. Finkbcin her " inhibitions , " by accepting Grimmie 's generosity . But then , Grimmie had to have an object for her enthusiasm . Katherine Griswold had said that . " Do n't mind taking a few pence , child . Grimmie has to see the hope of the world somewhere . At present , you 're the hope . " There was something brisk and lucid about Katherine , that Margot felt as tonic , even while she resented Katherine 's whole way of looking at things . Not thinking about herself in any personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , did leave her mind free and cool to pick out just the sensible side  --  kind enough , but with what Katherine called " rational " kindness , with an untouchable superiority that hurt . " I 'd never want to have to take anything from Katherine ! " At night , Margot and Grimmie talked for hours before the fire . Grimmie sat wrapped in a patchwork quilt that an old Kentucky mountain woman had given her , looking hunched and thin like a kindly witch . Grimmie had taught for six months in an experimental school in the Kentucky mountains . Grimmie'seyes , unworldly , innocently mad , took everything that Margot told her into herself and out of her warm lavishnessp389gave it back touched with the fire of her enthusiasm . She declared that Margot 's generation of girls was wonderful . They had learned a secret of life that her own generation had missed . They went out to meet life , that was it ! They sought . Margot said that all the women she had met at Katherine Griswold 's tea seemed bare inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grimmie cried with shining interest . " Well , I mean they all go into things , but just into things , all outside , they have n't worked out themselves . I mean , per-sonally . " " I see , I see ! " Grimmie chanted joyously . And she went around preaching the doctrine of the personal life to all her friends , until  --  Margot thought  --  they must hate me . Grimmie appreciated Jane too . " She takes life as it happens . She takes it lightly . " " I do n't want to take it lightly , " Margot said rebelliously , switching away from her championship of Jane , now that it was n't needed . " I want to take it hard and have everything matter . " Even now , because of what had happened to her  --  painful and broken as it was  --  Margot felt a sense of inner superiority to these women . She had felt it that day at Katherine 's tea , despite the comfort of returning to that atmosphere of feminine elegance . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her allegiance had gone back fiercely to the chilly , sooty-smelling darkness of her old basement apartment . Nearly all the women had wide bosoms and hips , but they were briskly spinsterish . They did n't believe in using make-up , and they were interested in outside questions . Running home through the cold autumn rains , leaping the puddles at the corners of the narrow streets , Margot had felt a rush of wild , defiant exuberance and kinship with the dark . A delicate thread of smoke went twirling up from her Armeniancigarette . Margot watched it , as she lay among the cushions . She had torn herself away from her torturing , unsatisfying absorption in Lee . But there was something still aching and un/appeased in the desolate darkness  --  somewhere far away from this fine , gray , upward twirl of smoke . All the time , it had been real ( rackingly , acutely real ! ) and yet , in some deeper way , not real at all . Their brief gloryingin likeness could not disentangle the hidden twists . Their hatred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of belittlement , just because they were alike . The knowledge that behind each of them was the guilty secret of unhappiness and early failure had only made them despise each other . But she had taken him away from Louise !  --  that was her triumph  --  that , and her superior boldness in escaping from Lee before he could escape from her . At the time , she had believed that nothingcould ever again hurt her so much . But now it seemed to Margot that she was crying because it had n't hurt her enough . She felt a hardy , fierce zest in the new knowledge that gleamed brokenly through her failure . She had wanted to shatter her nice-girl fastidiousness  --  to learn what innocent , beloved women like mother and Dorothy would never know ; a knowledge that would triumph darkly forever over the deft subtleties of the Mildreds and Louises who were after their own security . No boundaries , no limits , to feel herself out in open water . Margot heard with a secret delight the ticking of the little traveling clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room . And then all at once she was beset by the feeling of the cold November outside the windows  --  the smoky fires behind tatteredshields of rusty iron where children played in the small , dark canyons of the narrow streets  --  and she had to get out into the midst of it ! The dinner at Romany Marie 's was the first meal that Margothad enjoyed for itself since the breakfast in the French restaurant on the first day of her new existence . There was a fresh pleasure , subtly malicious , in being all alone . An assertion of herself , and defiance of all entanglements , and of what they could do to her . A piano was banging in the other room . But she no longer felt hungry and apart at the sound of other people having a good time together . She could live up to therequirements of life in this place . Beneath her sensuous pleasure in the spiced richness of the South European food , there seemed to run a strain of low , dark music that was an echo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her hand , as she dreamily took her last sip of the thick sweet coffee , that she enjoyed as being Turkish coffee , although she did n't like it . She stubbed out the light of Grimmie 's Armenian cigarette that she had brought along to match the food . The piano kept banging ; and the harsh music , reckless and discordant , seemed to follow out , like the accompaniment to a dance , the entangled lives of all the people in these narrow streets , Jane with her wilding , mongrel prettiness , Rod with his perverse delicacy , Marta 's fatal kindness  --  the reckless , fragmentary lives , and the bitter , broken childhoods that lay behind them . . . But she would escape ! As she had escaped from the motley little group of " others " at home in Belmond . Margot ran out alone into the windy darkness of the Square . Bare trees , dark sky , dark buildings , a few stars , and winter coming . She could breathe in the scent of change ! She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but herself ! Well , at any rate , she felt that she was forever superior to anyone like Lucille ! Margot had met Lucille on Fifth Avenueone day . Although they had n't really been good friends at home , Lucille was delighted to see her  --  with that provincial delight , Margot thought disdainfully , at meeting anyone who happened to come from the same place . They " must have tea together , " Lucille had said . Lucille 's greatest New York adventurewas still to have tea with another girl at an Alice Foote MacDougall tearoom . Never , never would she have to suffer now the fate of Vanchie 's withering innocence ! In the cold night , in the windy November darkness big and portentous coming down upon the earth , Margot felt aching deep within her the hurt and guilty shame of all that had been cruel and unscrupulous in her history  --  deceiving and breaking with the folks , the way she had treated the Bellews , her triumphant escape from Lee after she had taken what he could give her . yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her brief , discordant affair with Lee ... It had beenp382Margot recognized now , and had somehow recognized even then  --  just a dark , nameless , necessary prelude to her own story . How different it was tonight from the first time she had come to creep hungrily about the edges of the Village ! It was worth having gone through everything to have all this added to her . It had been for the sake of adding to that completed self which she saw standing like a figurehead at her ultimate destination . Before she had a past , she was n't even ready to begin . The night wind was blowing her clean . Then what was coming ? On the other side of the Square , Margot saw the old houses standing dignified and withdrawn . WHAT was it that gave this queer sense of familiarity ? Then Margot remembered . She used to live on this street ! She used to pass this small Italian bakery every day . Over there on the corner was the pet shop before which she used to stand looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her own little cat . The little black cat . She and Grimmie had gone night after night to search for it around Mary Lou 's old tearoom . But it had never come . . . . Here , in this very next house , was her first apartment ! Lord , how many since ? A feeling of dingy chilliness came over her with the memory of the sunless windows and the smoky fireplace . A strange distance separated her from all that had happened here . It was as if she were just beginning life again , and this time in her own real person . The days of the basement apartment had become a legend . What had happened to the people who used to live in this house ? Margot had gone only a few streets away ; and yet they , too , were legends . That little wisp of a man with the beautiful , bright , dark eyes  --  " a hack writer with a hacking cough , " hep393used to call himself  --  who earned a sort of living writing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know that I had beauty of a sort , and that more dangerous thing called charm . " He kept a scrapbook full of what he thought were his real works of genius , wistful little lyrics printed now and again in Sunday School papers or the lesser known household magazines . " Through the pale eveningComes a song . . . " Some of them did have a kind of dim , appealing , girlish charm . How Lee used to despise the little fellow ! Lee . It was more than a year since she had even heard Lee 's name . Margot did n't believe she had actually realized until this moment how much Bruce had affected her life . It was true , as Daggie reproached her , that she did n't see the old crowd now . Almost unconsciously , Bruce 's attitude had influenced her . They were " Villagers " in his eyes  --  play boys and girls who did n't know how to deal with the actual , solid things . And it was n't just the Villagers that Bruce disliked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disparage her whole way of life . Because her recklessness fascinated him and shamed his own solid prudence  --  the prudence that had got him into the dry rut of existence in which she had found him ! Nevertheless , it was that sense of solidity about Bruce that made Margot look back at the time in the basement apartment as shoddy and precarious . She repudiated the image of a little thin , dark Margotin bizarre earrings and a peasant dress , crouching over a fire of twisted papers in the smoky fireplace and getting a sense of romantic festivity over the burning of two five-cent candles . It was as if she were just coming up at last from the shadow into the real sunlight . And yet she pitied the little dark image . Underneath , she clung to it with stubborn pity . She was the only person on earth who would ever entirely know the painful , rapturous , inner secrets of its history . She knew how different this history really was , to her , from the version that Daggie , for instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice little chops.  | " When Margot Ferguson first came down to these parts , she was a scared little virgin from the hinterland , who had yet to taste her first strong drink . " Dr. Finkbein saw it as the bold stroke for freedom of a kind of Shaw female . Margot alone could know the secret of the grim resolution to conquer her fiercely shy virginity , to break the frozen glaze of self-distrust enclosing her . But now all her earlier affairs with men seemed nothing but a preparation for the meeting with Bruce . She turned and walked back to look at the house again . Deep down , there still lay a hurt loyalty to the old crowd , although she had forsaken them . There was something more than Bruce knew  --  not just " affectation "  --  in their refusal to admit the importance of any but intangible things . They were all lost children  --  Peter Pan 's Lost Boys afraid to grow up  --  and partly because ( she told Bruce fiercely in her mind ) most grown-up people were so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into . Anyone who could fit into it entirely was just a fool . And Bruce himself  --  as if he fitted ! Then he would never have come down to the Village , superior and curious , " just to look around , " and have found her in Marta 's tearoom . That day she still held in her memory as the beginning  --  with the darkness , the shine and smell of rain , the flicker of the inadequatefire , the muted , yearning sound of foghorns through the soft thickness of the air . Bruce had come into the room shaking himself slightly . He looked big and competent and excitingly out of place , as he took off and folded his heavy coat . His hands came cold and fresh out of his leather gloves , as he rubbed them together , and then took up the foolish little menu card . It was written in purple India ink , in Margot 's arrogantly girlish letters , with curly tails to the y 's and the g 's . The corners of his lips drew down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on and then immediatelytook off again and stowed away in a soft leather case . But she had interested him , standing and waiting in her Russiansmock , in spite of the superior , distrustful , uptown amusementin his eyes ! In that soft lull of between-time , with thep395foghorns sounding in the rainy air , her real life had begun to flower . She could n't stay here . This street was the past . She could n't admit her own inclusion among the Lost Boys and the Lost Girls  --  as she had refused to stay in Belmond and admit herself to be one of the company of local outlaws : Dr. Redmond , because he " went with other women , " and was vaguely tarnishedwith the rumor of illegal operations ; Louella Allen who had written letters to herself and declared they came from the good-looking young Methodist minister ; and that queer little shy-animal man , who had left his family and gone to live in an abandoned country schoolhouse , to be free to complete a great invention . Margot ran , leaping in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done with the old life , that had never been more than partly hers . . . although a lonely loyalty to it was crying somewhere in her heart . There was always a lingering , fairy-tale enchantment in openinga green door . The brick house , with its two dormer windows , looked private and small between the taller houses on each side . Then there was the beautiful , sumptuous knowledge that Bruce had found this place for her . He had gone with Margot and Frances one bright Sunday afternoon to look for apartments . He would n't have the girls living in a gas-heated house . " Margot might take out the plug some day when it happened to be raining and she 'd drunk a little too much the night before . " Margot tossed her head rebelliously at the memory of Bruce 's satirical tone . But at the same time a secret smile seemed to come from deep within and curve her lips . ( It was the same smile that Mildred Summers used to wear , lurking and subtle , when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had asked her to go to the football banquet . ) Margot had got her job through Bruce too . He had sent her to a friend of his who ran an advertising agency . " I ca n't have you living from hand to mouth this way . " The sense of Bruce 's protection pervaded Margot 's whole existence withp396a flattering , velvet warmth . She was the Fair Rosamund  --  the Dark Rosaleen  --  whom the king really loved and kept apart for his delight in this little house of enchantment . She ran up the painted staircase to her room . She stood for a moment in the warm air feeling her joy in coming out of the chilly street into the midst of beloved , significant possessions . Bruce had had something to do with nearly everything in this room . When he gave Margot her big armchair for Christmas , he had given Frances a chair , too , a dear little old-fashioned , oval-backed rocker  --  out of his dreadfulprudence ! Margot 's was upholstered in rose and Frances ' in blue . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winestainedmenu card stuck between pages seven and eight , disgustedwith her " totally feminine " reading . A nice big pair of shiny rubbers stood in full view near the fireplace , revealing the obtuse masculine simplicity that went along with his prudenceand competence , making her laugh at him and love him . But she must hurry ! She would get a scolding for being " extravagant with time . " She dashed into the little bathroom and turned on the water full-tilt . The door of Frances ' room was open  --  the neat , trim room , all in cool blue and white , precise as a spinster 's . Margot liked having Frances this close and no closer . Frances ' own continuous , although never tumultuous , love affairs added to the secret warm richness of feminine life in the crowded little apartment . Margot 's history had had more exciting episodes . But Frances was upheld in her cool poise by the constancy of the " older man " at home in Cincinnati to whom she could always turn . Bruce approved of Frances . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent if you do n't . " He insisted on his view of Margot as a " night moth . " Jane , the real " night moth , " he abhorred . Margot told Bruce she hated thrift . She had had enough of that at home , with Grandma Ferguson and Aunt Ella roused for weeks because once mother had let them , the two girls , wear their best dresses to school ! She was going to use her things , and not take care of them , and spend her money for what she wanted , not what she needed  --  with onlyp397one life to live and that " no longer than the sandpeep 's cry . " .. . But the tub must be full to running over ! The bathroom was steamy from the hot water greenish and bright in the porcelain tub . Thank heaven she was living with someone who liked to keep the bathtub clean  --  after those awful two months with Jane in the room with the peasant bed ! Margot poured in the powdery remains of her bath crystals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receptacles that she and Frances could n't resist when they went to the ten-cent store were more or less filled with cakes of scented soap in various stages of jellied dissolution . The blue , of course , belonged to Frances . The rose-red was Margot 's . Once more , blue and rose-red , just as it had been at home ! Margot wallowed luxuriously in the bath , thinking of the awful bathrooms that she had known in her varied life in the Village . Just at this moment , nearly everything was right ! She even liked the kind of advertising  --  perfumes , and draperies , and cosmetics  --  that they were giving her to do . Bruce was coming to take her out to dinner . She thought of her crazy old dream about Dr. Redmond . Perhaps it had been a sort of prevision  --  because now she really was having a love affair with a married man . Margot felt borne up lightly into fragrant luxury , above the fundamental precariousness of her life . The things that she had ached to possess , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She ran tapping back to her room in her black satin mules . Again the warm , intimate air surrounded her . Gossamer stockingswere strewn over the back of a wicker chair . On the table was her red leather handbag , alive with its soft creases , just as she had tossed it down . There was the inevitable , untidy gray sprinkle of last night 's ashes in the grate . The mirror hung above the polished chest of drawers between two tall , crimson candles . Margot saw her face stained with a rose-red flush and her throat white above the negligee of rose-colored silk . Her short hair was strewn in locks , glossy , damp and black . At last she had that miraculously " right " haircut , of which every woman dreamed . The glossyp398wave , shaped like the chiseled hair in sculpture , fell low across her forehead , but left the tips of her ears chastely exposed and glowing now with a faint rose-red . It gave just the touch of personal distinction to her features , and her great dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her head . The liquid powder she had learned how to use , when for three months she had done publicity for that awful French singer , whitened the brunette darkness of her skin . The rouge was laid on like the pressure of two rose petals . The painted mouth was a deeper rose . In the white face between the glossy black of the hair and the rose of the silken gown , the lashes of the two great eyes were like the upturned petals of some gorgeous flower . All the angles of her body had subtly filled with smooth white flesh ; and her arms , when she lifted them up from the loose rosy sleeves , were small and white and round  --  like the woman 's , arms in that poem in the Oxford Boole , that Daggie had once read to her , smiling . " When her loose gown did from her shoulders fall , And she me caught in her arms long and small . " ( But she had n't caught him in her arms  --  dear , dear little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Bruce said . ) Yes , at this very moment , she was on the thrilling , exquisite edge of becoming the very sort of person she had always meant to be  --  and she liked her name , her hair was exactly right at last , she had experience instead of ignorance behind her , and there was a man  --  a married man !  --  in her life . It had taken her all these years to struggle up fiercely from diffidence and innocence and provincialism . Now  --  when she was over thirty  --  she was coming into her blooming . " There came a day entirely for me . " She drew the rose-colored gown closely about her , and then opened it in a soft , flushed effulgence of revealment . All around her in the warm air of the sweetly crowded room there breathed a kind of sumptuousness of excitement , happiness , rich expectation , that was like the final ineffability of fragrance hovering over flowers.  |p399Bruce  sat in the armchair smoking while Margot put on her wraps . " It 's getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What kind of shoes have you got on ? " With a sensuous delight in obedience , Margot thrust out her foot , that felt beautifully slender in its satin slipper . " You 'll freeze to death in those things , you silly kid . Have n't you got some overshoes around somewhere ? " " Oivershoes . Galoshes ! Do n't make them sound worse than they are . " " Well , put ' em on , whatever you call ' ern . " " You are n't planning to make me walk all the way to Carlo 's , I hope ? " Margot shrugged her shoulders . Rubbers and even galoshes made her think of winters at home and being called back to the house protesting . But when Bruce told her to wear such things , she felt again that subtle , sensuous pleasure  --  that female pleasure in obeying , when she knew , half knew , that she could rule . She brought out the galoshes with exaggerated meekness and sat dreamily still while Bruce 's large white fingers were fastening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " He put his hand on her shoulder and turned her toward him . " What 's different about you ? Have I ever seen this dress ? " " About a million times ! " He frowned , and Margot laughed tantalizingly . She knew what the difference was that Bruce , in his large masculine obtuseness , could not name . But there was a breathlessness in her laughter . For mingled with the blooming of her power , she had a feeling of shyness , almost of flight  --  just what maidens were supposed to feel . She ! After the " experiences " that now lay satisfyingly thick behind her . She had felt it , with a delicioussurprise , when she had heard Bruce 's footsteps on the painted stairs . Bruce flipped the book on the table . " Let 's see how you 're getting along with Pearson . Eighth page ! Is that the extent of your progress ? " Margot lightly shrugged her shoulders , realizing obscurelyp400that his sardonic tone was partly a tribute to her  --  he wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt that she had power tonight . " I 'll get it read sooner or later  --  when I have time . " " Hmp ! " " I know what you 're going to say ! I 'm subjective , ' and just interested in what has a personal application , ' and what titillates the senses '  --  " She did a little dance step in front of Bruce before she took the book away from him . He could n't hurt her by criticizing her tonight . It gave her pleasure , since she thought she could discern in it a defense that he was putting up . And anyway , it was a delicately perverse delight to feel that she had power to fascinate him while he disapproved of her . Or thought he did ! Because men did n't know what they really felt  --  they always thought they felt according to their theories . " I do n't want to talk about science while I 'm starving . I do n't even want to talk about myself . " " It 's the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to button her heavy coat . Bruce put his hands down firmly on her shoulders and made her stand still . But she looked away sidewise , with a secret delight , thinking how all these poems and novels and biographies and memoirs that Bruce derided had their own purpose for her , all helping to make the very thing that troubled him tonight . She felt as if all her books were like a great bouquet of chosen flowers surrounding her with their fragrance ; and she smiled , lightly scorning Bruce 's " science " that did n't dare believe anythingwas said unless it was said in black and white . " Here  --  come on , you young Pavlowa . Get some of that food you 're starving for , and then you wo n't feel so airy . " Margot ran downstairs ahead of Bruce , drawing on her gloves as she went . Bruce was always very solemn and discreet , except when they were in her own apartment  --  probably trying to create the impression that his interest was equally divided betweenFrances and Margot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more , that they ask Frances when they went out together ! The people who owned the house , a youngish couplep401named Allison , he an editor of some sort and she an interior decorator , lived on the first floor . When Bruce chanced to meet either of them , he quite unnecessarily froze into his characterof heavily respectable business man . " Trying to look like an uncle ! " Margot thought in rebellious scorn . But there was no one in the hall tonight ; and Frances was working overtime and had n't come home . " Where are we going ? " " Why , to Carlo 's , are n't we ? " " That where you want to go ? " Margot felt almost foolishly hurt . Bruce knew it was their own special place , where they could feel hidden and alone ; and he ought n't even to suggest going anywhere else when she felt so happy . But he was so fearful of making the slightest admissionthat there was any understanding between them ! As they stood on the cold street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , and she felt shivering and alone . Bruce 's heavy figure in the expensive overcoat was like a monument of all the settled solidities that menaced everything she cared for . He looked like a family man . " Oh , of course we 'll go somewhere else if you 'd rather ! " Bruce smiled at the pride in her tone . " We 'll go where the little girl pleases . " " I do n't please any more than you do . " " Well , I please , then . " But she had to like him again for the curt , masculine gesture with which he signaled a carefully slowing taxi , and for the sound of his voice giving Carlo 's address . She tried to gather to her for protection all that she disliked : his blindness , obtuseness , terrible bulky stubbornness , the tone of amusement he used toward her friends ,  --  as if his country club friends from whom he was running away were better !  --  the rubber-stamp words he used like " radicals , " his insistence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Post , and that he only read Conradbecause it was " adventure stuff " . . . and yet all the whileshe was feeling the fine , perverse  --  yes , " ultra "  --  delight in forcing this very kind of man to admit her fascination . She was somehow incomplete with any other.  |p402But  the joy with which Carlo greeted them  --  greeted them together , as a couple : " Oh , Mees Ferguson , Meester Weeliams , come in , good evening ! "  --  seemed to renew their intimacy magically . " There 's our table all ready ! " Margot cried joyously . She sat down in her own special chair close to the warmth of the big stove where she loved to see the red cinders as they fell into the tray . Carlo 's was their secret place . No one they had ever heard of came here . Margot felt a childlike , blissful contentment . " I think maybe Mees Ferguson and Meester Weeliams come tonight ! " " Why ? " Margot asked eagerly . " Oh , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She laughed out joyously . Bruce went to hang up their coats with the serious care he bestowed on all material things of good quality , horrified at Margot 's habit of hanging things jauntily askew . He would n't believe her when she told him that once she had been even more pernickety than he . None of the family could do anything to suit her . Now , to cure herself of impossible fastidiousness , she had run to the opposite extreme . But then , Bruce demanded that things must have quality . In his eyes  --  gray , shrewdly appraising , with a surface of regulationbusiness man 's look  --  there was something baffled , hurt and defensive , obscurely misled , and unlit . Margot leaned her elbows luxuriously on the table . There was no one else here except a dark , silent Italian gobbling spaghetti at a corner table . She loved Carlo 's funny Italian ornaments on the mantel  --  a toy lamb , a little wineglass , and valentinish things made out of red and green tissue paper . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if the music were coming from the just perceptibly out-ofdateera of fifteen or twenty years ago  --  funny and touching , and sentimentally melancholy , like an old summer hat with its faded gaiety of flowers suddenly unearthed from a bent pasteboardbox on a top closet shelf . " Play my waltz thing , " she begged Bruce . He smiled at her with his expression of indulgence  --  the nicep403expression , not the false one that tried to belittle her . This was the way that she liked Bruce to be , just the way he was now . She loved the feeling that against the background of his strength and large indulgence she could play airily with even her whims in a willful refinement of her individuality . " You 're a funny girl . " Feeling the smiling fondness of his tone , she could sit back for a moment secretly with her enjoyment . The faded melody seemed to put her back into the undefinable time when Carlo 's rooms had been the parlor and back parlor of a distinguished mansion . Now the ornate carving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed . Margot liked to think herself sensuously back into the times of those old scenes in magazine illustrations she used to pore over on rainy days in the back room in the library where they kept the bound volumes of Ha : per 's . One of those scenes where there was always a sort of small , insignificant man with a curly moustache , overshadowed by the great bare shoulders and rounded hips and satiny train of a Gibson Girl . At the side stood a potted palm , just partly drawn into the picture . Any scene of the past was always romanticto Margot . And here was she , Margaret Ferguson becomeMargot , actually in such a room . . . but in her scant black crepe de chine post-war modern dress , her little pulleddownblack hat , with a dangle of earrings beneath it  --  and she was here with a man who was handsomer than any storybook hero , and she was beginning to live out her own thrilling , halfknown , half-unknown drama .. . Bruce was asking , " What can you give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stiff , torn white jacket he had run into his kitchen to put on ,  --  Margot adored his punctiliousness , here in this faded room  --  was eagerly repeating : " I have scalopini , I have broil ' chicken . . . " " I believe we 'll have the scalopini . Does that suit you , Mar-got ? " " And cheese ! " Margot put in eagerly . " My kind ! " " All right , then , Carlo , the scalopini , and a bottle of the red , and bring the girl her kind of cheese . " Margot sat back with a contented murmur . Carlo went offp404smiling . The faint music of the waltz had trailed into dying discords . " Do you want it on again , Margot ? " She shook her head decisively . Bruce laughed at her . " Little my , my , my , ' " he said . He shook her slightly . " Always knows what 's mine , ' does n't she ? " " Well , I have to ! Nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Do n't you think I have a little glimmeringby this time ? " She shook her head . " You do n't ? I only wish I knew my own as well ! " He got up , and touched her hair . " I 'm going out to discuss the subject of the wine more at length . Can you amuse yourself while I 'm gone ? " " Of course not ! " She would n't admit that Bruce , that any-one , really knew a thing about her . But it was only with Bruce that she had this feeling of sumptuous excess . It was his bigness , the kind of clothes he wore , his presents , his flowers , the way he scolded her , and looked after her , the little extra delicacies of food and wine . She seemed always to be moving in velvet surrounded warmly by his care . Bruce was the only one who could give her the right to be the princess of her own fairy tale . Margot rested her chin upon her hands and waited . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and left . Even though Bruce was in the other room , she felt close to him . She could sense that his first resolve to stand out against the fascinationshe had for him  --  pretending it was all amused friendship on his part  --  was melting into that complete indulgence in which they were most in harmony with each other . This strange , thrilling , discordant harmony ! Her time was coming . The day " entirely for her , " that she must have before she was willing to die . That was what she had realized , with that feeling of deliciousflight , when she had heard Bruce 's feet coming up the stairs . " All right . Got it fixed . " A shock of tenderness went through her at the familiar , mannishsatisfaction of the tone , mingled with a kind of underlying heaviness of responsibility long borne . She knew what it was that Bruce had really missed and wanted , although he couldn'tlp405name it or even perceive it . He had confessed to her once , as they sat before the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman in the two low chairs  --  with bashful difficulty , almost like a schoolboy  --  that she " stood for something he had missed . " She wanted passionately to fill the blind emptiness in his life . She had never felt like this toward anyone before  --  not as if she wanted to give things . It was as if her little glazed sheath of self-absorption had suddenly cracked , letting in a kind of light she had never known existed . Carlo came in , consciously and decorously reticent , but triumphant , with the hot dishes . " Oh , our beautiful food ! " Margot cried ecstatically . Bruce looked at her , smiling at her eager voice . The lines of bleak dissatisfaction seemed to have faded from about his mouth . Warmth had suffused the assured , hard gray of his eyes , under which lay that lost , dark bafflement . He had to admit her , as she had admitted him  --  not just smile indulgently at her highly personal tastes , really admit them . " Wait ! " Carlo cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running back from the kitchen with three of his dear , funny , squat little glasses , into which he poured the rich red port , with its hidden sparkle . " We mus'n ' have jus ' common glasses . Mees Ferguson she look so pretty tonight ! " Bruce flushed . " That 's right , " he said heavily . " Join me , Carlo . We 'll have to drink to Miss Ferguson . " " Thank you , Meester Weeliams ! Tha 's nice . " They both raised their glasses . Bruce touched Carlo 's almost solemnly . Margot 's face slowly grew hot up to the sculptured black wave of hair . She wanted to say something ; but she sat mute , helpless , open , in a shyness that made her eyes burn through a mist of tears . Carlo seemed to know with them that there was something significant about the little ceremony , and to be giving them his blessing . The flush slowly died . Carlo had left the room again . There did n't seem to be any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the embers falling down into the tray of the stove . Bruce put his hand over hers . Margot sat looking down at thep406large white hand with its plain gold ring . Who had given that to him ? His wife ? Margot had always disdainfully and airily skirted the thought of Bruce 's wife . But all at once she hated the woman with a blinding hatred . Bruce never mentioned her directly . Only once or twice , as if inadvertently , he had referred to his family  --  and once at the first , conscientiously , to let Margot know that they existed . But Margot was scornfully sure that she could imagine what the woman was like !  --  one of the kind who had always been her enemies . Louise , Mildred , yes , clear back to Eve  --  the fair , smooth , sly , complacent , deft " womanly " women , who were nothing on their own , made out of a rib of man , or pretending that they were so made to keep the man happily conceited . Even mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman in Belmond ! When all that they were after was to line the nest for themselves , and , by lining it so softly , to blind their mates to the wild , rapturous freedom outside . And the man plugged away , and read travel and adventurestories . But this was her day . She was the dark other one . Hers was the secret of the " ultra . " And she felt fiercely exultant because her hand beneath Bruce 's , narrow and satiny white , lay significantly ringless . Bruce drew away his hand and pretended to be absorbed in his dinner . But from the slight rigidity of his shoulders , the way he looked away and cleared his throat , Margot could tell that he , too , realized that their " friendship " had imperceptibly , involuntarilyreached another stage . Impatient as she had been at Bruce 's prudence and his ostrich blindness , a kind of painful , suffering reluctance that she discerned in him , and closed her mind against  --  yet Margot herself relished the slowness , almost sumptuous slowness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phase , leaving the last one behind in an epoch utterly past . She wanted to dwell in each stage by itself , experiencing its final essence , knowing that when it was gone it was irrevocable . It seemed that she had known beforehand  --  fromthe day of her birth , almost  --  every stage as she reached it . And yet each one was utterly new when it came , with the blinding shock of a revelation . But now the time had arrived when both of them must see  |p407and  acknowledge where they were moving . Carlo 's quaint little compliment had torn away the veil . Why should she care about that woman in the background , any more than the woman would care for her ? The Eves had all the soft places . Everybody was on their side . But she could n't make a single move toward Bruce . She felt amazed , terrified at her helplessness . Not even to grasp what she fiercely felt belonged to her ! It was as if she had to sit just trembling and waiting  --  because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . For this she had broken ruthlessly through her old bonds of fastidiousness and fear , so that she could be free whenever it came , ready for it , equal to whatever it demanded . She had lost the bold , wild aggressiveness with which she had torn Lee away from Louise . That would n't count now . She could n't make a single move . Because this was the test ! All the womanhood that she had acquired would go for nothing unless he proved to her that it was nothing she did , but herself , that was desired . Bruce was looking at her , and Margot looked back at him with her eyes open in a suffering , dark , exquisite humility . He could take her or leave her . That was the truth . Nothing counted if she had to take him . " It 's a pretty funny thing , is n't it , that a man can go along for forty years not knowing that he wants something ? He must be pretty much of a dub , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste ! " Margot said bitterly , falling quickly into her old self-distrust . " Anyway , I 'm getting to see it 's something it would be damned hard to get along without . What am I going to do about it ? " Margot would not answer . Bruce asked her suddenly , " Where did you get those great dark eyes ? " It was a silly question . It sounded like Red Riding-hood . It was what she had heard in her childhood until she was sick of the words . " Where did that child get those eyes ? " But then it had always seemed to be in a tone of reproach , marking her off from the rest of them . When Bruce said it , he marked her offp308too  --  but as someone special , unique , chosen . She had been waiting all her life to hear this said to her in just this way . It blotted out the other voices with a miraculous comfort  --  as if Bruce had known . It was too perfect to be true . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack again . A strange , almost mystical sense of enlargement came over her , in another of those blinding sweeps of revelation . It seemed as if she knew herself , and , through herself , something more . It was n't just Margot Ferguson whom Bruce was choosing  --  but all that she stood for , the one precious thing that had gone so long neglected , useless and yet absolutely necessary above a dead level of existence . . . the enhancement , the " ultra " . . . finally given its right to be , through her , if Bruce , with his solid masculine authority , could see and choose it . " Margot . You have n't answered my question . " She struggled blindly to say something . " I ca n't now . " Because she felt wildly that this time it must be perfect , not flawed and broken . Perfect , if it lasted for only an hour ! This was part of her own story , in which every event must be true and real , and follow out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bruce as to her . She knew the creed of all her friends  --  to snatch at happiness wherever it offered , and not think beyond : there was little enough of it in this world . But this time  --  the great time  --  must be all beautiful . Her after-life would have to feed upon it . Whatever was wrong and unbeautiful could never be made up for . It would hurt her forever . This was n't just a " Village affair . " Some more embers dropped into the tray . Taxis passed in the street , below the windows , and an old street car went bumping and banging down there , the trolley scraping out a momentary fire . " When arc you going to answer it ? " " Some time . " Margot got up . She was n't conscious of planning any action . There was something outside herself that did it for her . Maybe astrologists were right , and her guiding star was in power.  |p309She  wandered about in a soft restlessness while Bruce paid the bill . She stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets , and the narrow edge of the island , the whole Atlantic lay . In the wideness of the night , she was conscious again of that mystic enlargement . She felt her part in the universe . Her own line in history and tradition . All the powers were in league with her , everything she wanted was coming to her . But this time it must go slowly , like music  --  not hasty , broken , snatched , and jangled !  --  until it reached its perfect consummation . She went over and petted the toy lamb , feeling childishly that it was allied with her , in her feminine world , against all the ways of men . " You like your supper , Meester Weeliams ? " " Everything was fine , Carlo ! " " You like it , Mees Ferguson ? " " It was the best I ever tasted . " Carlo opened the door for them , with a beneficent flourish of courtesy . " Good night , Mees Ferguson , Meester Weeliams , come again ! " As she undressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one quick glance out of the window and down at the little back garden . It belonged to the people downstairs . It was nothing but a square of earth not quite covered with thinrooted , yellow-green city grass . At home , the folks would n't have called it a garden . But the jonquils were enough . When she saw the flutter of petals on the long single stems , pale green and tender in the strip of damp black at the foot of the high board wall ( where a neighborhood of cats promenaded ) she could feel the spring hovering around them , wild and secret and sweet . Windows were open in the brick houses of varying heights that faced each other across this pleasant side street . It gave a mingled feeling of intimacy and variety to see the warm flutter of all the curtains  --  white , rosy net , bright cretonne , and some long draperies of golden silk that blew softly out and then clungp410for a moment , like butterflies , to the snowy window sills in the third story of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different , unknown people were having their experience of spring . Margot felt that she loved New York until she wanted to leap and run and break into shouts and singing ! She loved to sit on the swaying top of the green bus that lumbered down the Avenue in the early twilight toward the arch standing small , but with a hardy dignity , among the budding trees . That was when she reexperienced the triumphant feeling she could never get over . . . I 'm in New York ? She loved the blue-gray twilights when the buildings near Central Park had the quality of old-fashioned paintings of the Whistler period , that made her think of pretty ladies in victorias , with gleaming eyes behind tiny veils , breathing the perfume of the violets that brought memories of their lovers . She loved the fragrance  --  the sudden whiff of heliotrope  --  that came from the massed bunches of yellow and white and lavender flowers for sale on the warm street corners ; and to hear , on an idle Saturday afternoon , sitting on her day-bed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beloved little dish of flowered red pottery Grimmie 's friend Jonsen had brought her from Mexico , and knowing that she was going out to dinner with her beloved  --  to hear the long-drawn-out cry of the bearded old man hunched over on the seat of his small wagon crammed with pots of pansies delicate and living in their damp earth , the wagon slowly passing down the street , the wheels creaking , the old horse stopping . . . The folks pitied her , no doubt , for being shut up in New York ! But Margot had become a city child . It was more exciting , not to see , but to feel all the bloom that was centered in one row of jonquils ; the relaxed warmth of the evenings when she and Bruce walked back from Carlo 's , stopping at the window of the little antique shop , and Bruce carried her jacket over his arm . " Pastures that call from a leaf . " Because intimations were all that she could stand ! And even now , she could scarcely endure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her heart . . . she would have to run out shouting  --  or do some-thing .... She buried her head in her black satin cushion . But now the first beautiful time was over , almost over  --  the time when it seemed that her love was more precious to her for the quickening sense it brought to every tiny thing she did : putting away her clothes clean and crisp from the laundry , eating in her French restaurant at noon  --  even more precious than being with Bruce himself . That had suddenly become perilous . Such bliss poured through her when he even touched her hand that it left her nerveless and shattered . She was afraid . They were both afraid . Because they must wait until they were alone , just she and her lover together , in a time stolen out from ordinary existence to be their secret treasure forever . She had put off a little glaze of sophistication to learn this new thing step by step , exactly as it happened . Now , with her eyes closed tight and the cushion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from the very beginning . The rainy day in Marta 's tearoom , with the foghorns weaving their muted music , like the prelude to a great event . The dinner at Carlo 's when he had greeted them together , knowing that they would come , and they had kissed , and she had had the courage to send Bruce home . The blank , awful hours when she jumped into a taxi and rode and rode because she could n't stand it to be anywhere without him . The night when Bruce had come solemnly to talk to her , and they had seen that they must make their mighty decision , like people in a play . Only the play was real . " Margot , you know I 'm married . I do n't see how this thing is going to end . " " I do n't want to be married . I want to be perfectly happy . " " And you think I can make you perfectly happy ? " He was the only person in the world who could . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  for the gift of everything that he had missed . It did n't matter where they went , only so it was away from here , nowhere they had ever been , a place that would belong to them alone . Then when it was over , it would be over . Margot got up , breathing quickly.  |p412It  was time to take her bath . But first she must dance around her room , bare feet softly thudding on the painted floor , to experience the naked joy of her own body , the movements of her arms " long and small , " the rosy flowering of her breasts . Alone for the last time . No sunshine in her cool back room . She felt herself cringe away from the imperfections of earlier experience . Now she understood why a bride should be virginal . But there were always forerunners . Even Juliet had had some dim predecessor with Romeo . That was the role of the others , in the secret continuity of her life story , whose destiny had been to shatter her fear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which at last she was fully ready . There was a sense of queer reluctance in having the time come . She wanted to hold it back , to stay a little longer in this cool shadow , before she must step into the open light . She could never have this time again . When it had reached its fullness , it would be over . Again she had the old sense of something irrevocable  --  anundertone of her own low music that made tears from a secret , lonely depth come slowly to her eyes . But this was her own time ! The day " entirely for her . " With that knowledge , she seemed to enter again into that sense of mystic enlargement . She huddled down among the cushions . Her own body was small and white at the center of a spreading darkness that was fluttering and alive with intimationsshe could barely touch . It was as if suddenly she could see that everything in existence was bound together . Yes , in books , in poetry , it was beginning to be her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was her kind of clothes that women were wearing ; not the girly-girly things she used to storm at ; but things that were rakish , dashing , brief and colorful , eyes mysterious and dark under the pulled-down softness of the little hat brim , earrings dangling . The clothes she had had to wear when she was a girl were just a disguise . These were her self-assertion . Now shocked elderly authors felt it incumbent to write about " the modern girl "  --  usually landing her back in the home , of course , well chastened , but sometimes actually permitting her to triumph at the end ! It had seeped even into the movies . The Mary Pickford curls had given way to thesleek darkness of the " vamps " and the naughtiness of the flappers . Bringing it down , of course , to its lowest terms ! The other day she had met Lucille . With her open middlewestern face , soft and featureless as a prairie landscape , her pretty-girl clothes , and the wrong kind of lipstick , Lucille was placed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up her career and enter into the duties of wife and mother , looking back on the one romantic day when an actor had taken her to tea . It was the dark , vivid , naughty heroines of the Restoration who were in favor now with the intelligentsia . They were reviving Congrevein the Village little theaters . Poetry was doing homage to Lilith instead of Eve  --  Eve , whom Margot always pictured as an opulent nude , standing in a modest position , and looking up from under fair tresses with the sly , self-satisfied glint of Mildred Summers ' eyes . Even that little Harvard professor , a friend of Grimrnie 's , had read a ponderous sonnet to Lilith . " When I look into the darkness of thine eyes , Where dwell those sparks of infinite dangerousness . " As if any real " dangerousness " would n't scare him to death ! Katherine Griswold , pretending to seek an ash tray , had leaned over Margot to whisper , " Child , beware ! " But then , it showed ! Now the triteness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was Rose Red who was coming out into the sunshine , and Snow White who was banished to the shady side of the story . Dorothy had had her time . She was married , and had babies , and was living in a bungalow in southern California . Rose Red could no longer be shunted off with the prince 's brother . . . because she , Margot , had been given the personal crown of Bruce 's true love . Now it was she who was getting the roses . Bruce had sent them to her last night . They were the deep crimson ones , her own kind ; not the pinky-white ones that Dorothy had carried at her wedding ; but roses , and not the off-flowers that were lovely , but at the side . Now she could claim the rose , the center of bloom . She looked at the red glow of her roses in the midst of the deep green leaves . Exultance spread all through her from some exquisite center of joy . " These are for you . " But413p414even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beautiful and dark . The undertone to her happiness sounded its own low music  --  the knowledge , at the very height of the moment , of its briefness , and its irrevocability . She went to take her bath . The drumming of bright hot water into the porcelain whiteness of the tub , the reckless scatteringof crystals from which a powdery fragrance rose , the peeling of thin white paper from the smooth cake of Red Rose soap  --  all these made up the sumptuous beauty of a feminine ritual . Care of her body was a secret religion . All this spring , buying clothes with a magnificent extravagance , Margot had told herself , " It 's now ! " And afterwards  --  who knew , who cared ? Everything  --  she thought , as she splashed the sudsy water  --  everything contributed to make this her springtime . She could see something symbolic even in the weather . First , the cold ; but even then , with a wild sweetness in the air . The dark March , when rain dashed against the windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fire . Those days were like the first fragmentary , stormy intimations of love . The clouds were darkened and then white above tall buildings , suddenly breaking in the wind to show a cold blue April sky . And now the wonder , the warm amazement , of a May all soft and ineffable , coming with the marvelous blessing of fulfillment after the spring storms ! Margot dashed back into her room . She was warm and glowing . With the same high sense of secret ritual , she began to put on her new clothes . She must have everything new to correspondwith her new existence . The silk stockings were still creased and shimmery . The little bodice and knickers of crepe de chine clothed her in silken softness . Everything was contributing ! It was as if she stood at the center and all things converged by some natural law . Other people felt it . Men looked with blank eyes at the vacant seat in the bus and sat down by her . The old man at the corner paid her gallant compliments when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endure shrewd , deflating looks from salesgirls . They brought out their nicest things as if she would n't deign to consider any others . Even that stiff at the office beganp415to show signs of interest ! Suddenly all her old friendships opened new intimacies . People whom she had n't seen for months began to seek her out again . She and Grimmie had talked until two , sitting on the floor in front of Grimmie 's fire , with sherry gleaming in the little cut-glass tumblers ; and Margot had let herself go in the luxury of telling Grimmie all about herself and Bruce . Grimmie had begged her solemnly not to let this pass without fulfillment . " No matter what 's in the way . Do n't you let go of it . Margot . It will never come again . " She saw Grimmie 's face with its fuzz of graying hair , the profile that was like a kind Indian 's , with a queer , mad touch of nobility ; and she felt how other life histories were woven about her own in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , had been in love with a married man . But they had parted with a single kiss . It was as if the imprint of that kiss could still be traced on Grimmie 's lips , full and dark and faded , marking her out for renunciations and throwing her into vicarious generosities . The man had stayed in the Missouri town , getting fat outside and hollow inside , like all people who let the perilous , real thing go . Margot felt , with the deepened poignancy that even the slightest things awakened in her now , the sense of underlying kinship with women . Not with the smooth , safe , complacent ones , who worked underneath for security !  --  but with the others . " You and Bruce take your holiday . Do n't pay any attention to what may happen afterwards . Everything has an afterwards . " It was true that love was fatal , no matter how silly that might sound in all the little verses that repeated the same thing over and over ; thousands of little voices murmuringwords that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Margot that what had come to her was something she had always foreseen , although it was so utterly surprising in its actuality ; and the unreal , shattered remnants of the old existenceshe had lived through just because she could n't help it , were being cast behind her forever . Now that she had entered upon her own story ! She heard Frances ' discreet little knock . " Margot ! May I come in ? " " Oh ! I supposed you were at the office . " p 416 " I skipped out . I wanted to say good-bye . " " Oh , Frannie ! You darling . " Frances came on into the room . She had on her little dark blue silk dress , and her face had its office sallowness , dramatizingthe radiance of Margot . Frances conceded that generously . " You 're all ready ! Where did you get the beautiful bag ? " " Grimmie 's . She let me take it . No , not what you think ! " Frances sat down on the day-bed while Margot put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two red candles in the silver sticks . Margot had n't told Frances much about the journey . But of course Frances knew that she was going somewhere with Bruce . " You look grand in your new suit ! " " Do you like it ? " Margot turned around from the glass . Frances came up to her . She said in a softened , moved tone : " You look beautiful . I hope you 'll be happy , darling . " And kissed her . Tears sprang into Margot's. eyes . And as she looked at Frances ' small face pale between the bands of smooth brown hair , she felt again that deep sense of kinship . Frances , Marta , Jane , Lenore . . . All women in the world wanted to be made happy once . Then they could afford to die . " I want you to take these roses ! " " Oh , no , Margot ! " " Yes , I do . I ca n't take them with me . " " Goodness ! " Frances tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She stood pale and small with her arms around the great bouquet . Margot saw her little face looking down from the head of the painted staircase . The door of Margot 's own room was closed . She did n't know when she would open it again . She was leaving everything  --  the red-and-gold Chinese tea set , the fireplace , the rose-red chair , the books in the low white shelves , the poetry that she had been reading all over again , seeking affirmation now instead of the old hungry knowledge . But she was going away from other people 's stories . In her bag , beneath the pale silk nightgown , lay the only book that she wanted to take  --  the little red notebook in which , on beautifully smoothp417new pages , she would inscribe every flutter of ecstasy so that nothing , nothing , of this time could ever be lost . She felt that she was opening the green door into her fairy tale . It was warm and sunny in the street . One of the golden curtains hung over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roar came loud from over on Sixth Avenue . Now it seemed to Margot that all this part of the huge , thrilling city was secretly packed with her own memories  --  every little news stand and tearoom and shop on the narrow streets . But she was going away to some enchanted place that had never really existed before and would never really exist afterwards . " Margot ! Catch ! " One big red rose plumped down at her feet . She bent to pick it up , to wave at Frances " Here , taxi ! " In the taxi , with its smell of leather and stale tobacco , its scrunched-up , empty cigarette package on the floor , she had all at once a small , ordinary , empty calm . " Where to , miss ? " " The Grand Central . " Again she crossed the interminable width of floor , with the great slants of cathedral light pouring down from the hugenessabove her  --  she , Margaret Ferguson , who had come here such a few years ago , in that old tan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enter upon her destiny . They stopped at a filling station , and Bruce got out to ask about the roads . " Better get out too . Not good for you to sit too long . " He helped Margot out of the car , and they stood for a moment in exquisite unity . It seemed impossible to part for even this tiny while . " Be good while I 'm gone , " Bruce whispered . He went into the office of the filling station , and Margot wandered off in the clear , dry sunshine . P418But she would never again be really alone . She was doing as Bruce had told her , keeping the memory of his touch . There were some nameless white flowers growing in the rough soil . As Margot bent down to touch them , the old sensation of existingwithin herself came over her like the shadow of a memory . But yesterday stood forever between her and the old narrow groove of personal intensity . In the miracle of perfect union , the enclosing sheath of individuality had been finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness in which she seemed to move with a divine unconsciousness . This was the region she had always known that she would find . But now that she had actually entered it , every feature of the sunlit landscape held the shock of a magic newness . Every step of the way , long traced in a dream , was a divine discovery . She had known what it was to be perfectly happy . She had had the day that was entirely her own . But instead of making her ready to die , as Margot had always supposed in a dazzled way , it had opened up further whole regions of discovery  --  likethis cloudless sky above the plains , which , as she looked , went into depths on depths of blue . But now she felt too happy . She wanted to seek some shelter . Besides , she was too far away from Bruce . The car stood in the dazzling sunshine . Now it seemed years and years ago that Margot had first seen it standing  --  stiff , embarrassing and new  --  beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had agreed to meet , on that first awful day when they had started out afraid to be with each other , cold and stage-struck at the beginning of their venture , feeling as if they were asking too much of an uncomprehending and grudging world . Margot got into the car and slammed the door after her . The sound had an intimacy so deep that it filled her with unbelievable contentment , shutting her in with memoriesthat were all alive within the small , warm silence . Yesterday . Now it had become " yesterday . " But it had been . And she still possessed it . She could see the rushing , cold stream where they had bathed , the space under the pine trees where they had lain together . The brown butterfly still hovered above the red mountain flower . Margot moved restlessly on the warm , velvet P419seat , feeling the difficulties before her if she was to keep her memory of perfection forever secure and undiminished . A strapping young fellow in coveralls came toward the car , with his blond hair glinting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , you folks are together ! " He nodded toward the oil station . His grin , with the flash of white teeth in the tanned , grease-smudged face , had an easy , friendly understanding and acceptance . Margot saw Bruce 's firm , large figure , as he leaned with one elbow on the counter having an earnest masculine confabulation with the oil station man over a spread-out map ; and the pride of their being together was almost more than she could endure . The young fellow thumped a tire . He was sticking around because he admired her . But admiration came easy now that she no longer needed it . " Not had this car very long , have you ? " Margot smiled and shook her head . In her brown tweed suit and light felt hat , and the scuffed , comfortable , easy grace of her laced Prince of Wales shoes , she had a flattering consciousness of herself as an impressively urban figure out here in the anonymous countryside . " I saw it was a new car . It sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of service too . " He nodded , and tapped the hood in appreciation . " New York ! Looks like you folks are a good ways from home ! Going out to the coast ? " " Just driving . " " Sure ! Well , that 's the way to do it . " He grinned at her again , and went off . Margot could see the gestures of the two men inside the building . Their movements had a pleasant , earthy slowness behind the sunny glare of the large front window . With a subtle smile of feminine contentment , Margot sat back to wait and let them settle the question of the roads between themselves . Now , with her head resting against the soft upholstery , and her bare hands folded , she could feel the sense of anonymouscountry leisure widening around her in the sunshine . " A good ways from home , " the young fellow had said . New York  |p420seemed  more incredibly far away to Margot than it must seem to him . Only that speeding stream of noisily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place with any memory of the city ; and even the cars were more widely spaced than they had been . She thought of New York standing incredibly on its island , like some separate walled city , tall and feudal and feverishly modern , existing in and for itself , a crazy pattern of streets and buildings and rushing people caught in the thundering network of trains above and below . The life was a fevered , half-mad , half-splendid dream . Existing within the dream , on its own terms of terrible immediacy , people had to believe in it to the exclusion of all other existence . Get outside  --  and it was incredible ! Margot felt the slow , beginningsweetness of a kind of reconciliation to the land . The rough dry ground smelled good . A tuneless music thrilled along the telephone wires . Now it seemed that a great space , that was more than just miles of country , lay between her and all the life she had known up until now . She looked at Bruce , standing big , easy and absorbed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over again the wonder of the richness with which his love had endowed her , adding to her what he was , filling out the empty places of her own being . All that had been rudimentary and fragmentary in her experience was miraculously fulfilled . . . even her silly old notions about Dr. Redmond at home , about having an affair with a married man . . . the need for someone big and competent in a worldly way that perhaps she had got from her old admiration of Frank and Sybil , and her dissatisfaction with the folks . . . the desire for the shock and delight of what was different from herself that had first been aroused when she had seen Jesse and Dorothy exchanging their bridal kiss . . . . At this moment Margot 's life seemed to her an illuminated landscapein which all the lines were in perfect focus . Bruce reached out and put his forefinger on a spot on the map . There was something personal in that little gesture  --  something that she recognized as Bruce  --  something dominating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hot possession . It frightened her , threatening her ideal conception of love , which dictated that it must end when it was over . Her fear seemed suddenly to strike her with a distant , vicious hatred of the shadowy figure of the wife , who must have seen that very movement , who knew the brief , accurately judging squint with which Bruce " sized up " a hill before they came to it , the way in which he accomplished everything with that satisfyingly competent minimum of movement . She wanted to blast the woman into forgetfulness  --  to scorn her out of existence ! With a piercing overflow of jealousy , Margot seized Bruce 's heavy driving glove , that he had thrust into a pocket of the upholstery , and pressed it up against her face . But an hour of yesterday was something that only she herself and Bruce would ever know . Margot felt that it had annulled everything that went before it . The men whom she had known before she knew Bruce seemed to have been washed out of existence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was now . It was this moment , sunny and still , in the great slow drift of time , and she was living in it . Bruce came out still looking thoughtfully at the map . He spread it open against the wheel . Margot fidgeted in her seat . She felt a qualm of the minutely vigilant fear which still had to keep its strained hold beneath the surface of her happiness . She sat scarcely breathing . If they had already had the best of their love , and Bruce was beginning to forget about her , then it had to be , and to try to do anything would be only a violation . Bruce 's right hand slipped down from the wheel and groped softly and blindly for hers . She felt the even clasp . Everything swung into focus again , the sky was brilliant , and now to sit here while Bruce made out the way was only a delicious waiting . Margot felt the rapturous triumph of her power , of having torn Bruce out of his fixed orbit and brought him over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own kind of things  --  the out-of-the-way things , and out-of-the-way places , that had always been discredited . Through his love for her , she had triumphed finally over Eve immemorial  --  as somehow she had always felt that it was in her destiny to do . The magic balm had soothed and satisfied all the ancient wounds in her vanity . Bruce was the kind of man who , until now , had always belonged P422to the enemy . But it was more than satisfied vanity . It was lifted far , far beyond that  --  so far , that she could only realize , with a distant wonder , that the old cuts no longer hurt . Margot bent swiftly down to Bruce 's hand and kissed it . Then she settled happily into her place . She heard the familiar , exciting , mounting sound of the engine . The youth in coveralls , who was tinkering with a car , grinned and lifted his hand in a farewell salute . Margot waved back at him . As they drove away from the filling station , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free beings who had got outside all the small involvements of ordinary local existence . " Want to drive ? " Margot shook her head . With Carl at home , she used to have tremendous battles over the car , treating all his directions with the highest scorn . But with Bruce she felt a soft , pampered and pampering feminine luxury in sitting back and letting him have the wheel . It seemed to her now as if any action of her own , anything that she did simply on her own account , would rouse up the separate individual being that was now submerged in love . Being in love was an element as far beyond control as the May weather . They were both lost in this element , and actions of their own could only distort the miraculous truth and rightness of love 's unfoldment . Everything must be acceptedas it came  --  even the moments when Margot felt herself drop into sudden bleak torture at the perception that she and Bruce were awry . . . when his way annulled her way , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . when the shimmering texture of happiness was endangered . Now if an ending was in their minds , they kept it cannily hidden from themselves and each other , closing their minds to a decision that loomed somewhere ahead of them , far beyond this limitless sunshine . Bruce was sitting in the lobby . The moment Margot stepped out of the elevator , he dropped his paper and went over to her . She saw at a single glance , with an exquisite relief and triumph , that he had been sitting and watching the elevator . His face broke into a smile that was a confession , as he stepped quickly forward and touched Margot 's arm .  | " Have a good sleep ? I did n't either . " He grinned down at her . They could not kiss before these people . But this mute acknowledgment of their need for each other , with hands just touching , was better than a kiss . For a moment , as they stood together before going toward the dining room , they felt the marvel of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lying for the first time alone , it had seemed to Margot , taut with the strain of that vigilant watchfulness , that perhaps the best was gone , and that she must speak quickly if she was to be the one to say when the parting was to be . But this morning they were happier than ever to be together . Reunion was another miraculous discovery . And only now that she had escaped it , could Margot really see into what a black pit she had been staring . But the danger was already incredible and forgotten . " Well , we 'll make it up on breakfast , " Bruce said . They went into the dining room . The head waiter instantly withdrew his hand from the chair of the table at which he had stopped , when he saw Bruce 's slight frown , and led them towardthe window . Several women sitting together were looking at them with impressed curiosity , and Margot had the delightful sense of their seeming a handsome and interesting couple . It was cool and quiet in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a retreat . Bruce would n't admit it , but Margot knew that he had been afraid to take her to the more fashionablehotel . Out in the lobby , an Indian with a darkly classic face pattered over the tiled floor with baskets which he silently offered for sale . The other people in the dining room  --  an elderly fat man at a solitary table , and one of those inevitable parties of school-teachery women  --  seemed to offer almost a surfeit of safety . But there was always , even here , a slight tingle of danger in coming among people . Bruce feared this , but Margot loved it . " How grand the food looks ! " " Does look pretty nice . " The smiles they exchanged were an admission . The magic still held , brighter , more radiant than ever , since they had learned how lost and empty it was to be apart . The fresh roses on the table , the grapefruit with their red cherries , the silver P424covers over the buttered toast , all seemed festive . The pleasures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been horrid and confusing coming into the hotel . Even on this side street , the noise had been hideous , after the room in the adobe house where they had slept the night before , in a small sanctuary of Spanish domesticity made up of stiff lace pillow shams , artificial flowers , family photographs , and rosaries , in beautiful incongruitywith the great , pure , surrounding silence of the desert . Margot had felt as if she were bidding some kind of mournful , significant farewell when she had taken off the scuffed Prince of Wales shoes that had gone along so many beloved trails through mountain forests and meadows , leading her to the edges of silent lakes , and to hidden clumps of tall , blue columbines ; and the tweed suit that kept in its rough meshes the dust of the roads and the smoke of their campfires . But this morning she felt washed and fresh and gay in her light silk suit and her shady hat . Now the noises in the narrow street had a cheerful sound . The cool room was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margot looked out of the large window and felt with new delight the exotic strangeness of the place . Indian women in bright-colored dresses were passing ; and she saw two men in ten-gallon hats , one of them wearing a red velvet jacket with Navajo silver belt . It was the kind of place that she could love , her kind . She felt with mystic certainty that they had reached a goal . After breakfast , she would make Bruce walk with her through the narrow streets looking at the silver bracelets and the Indian baskets , which enchanted her , while her ingenuous delight at the " foreignness " enchanted him , making him smilinglyand teasingly indulgent , as she adored him to be . " I love it here , " she said . She loved all the West . Now she had found her own country . Margot felt that all over again , when they took the car , that had been newly washed and greased , and drove out along the desert road . She remembered how it had been coming through the Middlewest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonely , dissatisfied girlhood , and she felt every minute that the big front windows of familiar-looking frame P425houses in all the little towns were glaring at her with the same old humdrum , settled , family disapproval she was sure everyone at home would feel if they knew about this journey  --  and they would stop her if they could ! But at the first sight of mountains , lying blue beyond the plains , she had felt that she was out of the houses ' reach . It was the West , where everything was different  --  the land of outlaws , and bright colors , and bad women , and high-stepping horses . The soil yielded gold and silver and turquoise , instead of just everlasting " crops . " It was hard and unmanageable and magnificent  --  her country  --  not the fertile soil the folks called " good land , " moist and obedient to the plow , settling down tamely and patiently to the tasks that people exacted of it . She thought of the old country roads , as they were printed on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marks of wagon wheels and horseshoes and of the aimless struttings and scurryings of chickens patterned the soft warm dust under a fringe of willow trees . It pleased Margot to think that Grandpa Ferguson would have said this land was " good for nothing , " because it could n't be " harnessed to the plow . " " You are useless , oh grave , oh beautiful . .. " How she had hated " useful things " from her childhood up !  --  shoes that were bought " to give good service , " those awful dresses , the kind Mrs. Bellew had wanted her to buy , that would be " appropriate for any occasion , " houses that were supposed to be " nice " because they had regulation comforts , and the kind of dismal burgs that dad called " nice little towns " because they had the usual set-up of brick bank building and stores and churches and vile little movie house . Margot rebelled joyously against all that the folks had ever called " good " ; and now , in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnificent madness , she had her justification . At last she was in her own land . At home , it had always seemed as if everything really belonged to Dorothy and not to her . Dorothy 's girlish loveliness was the only kind that counted . But Margot had always known that somewhere was the place where she belonged . Here , even the flowers were her flowers . The red and yellow cactus blossoms wore her own colors ; and she felt that something in herself went with their frail , silken delicacy and wildness . And there was something in her , too , that could match and live up to the fierce splendor of these mountains  --  something that none of the folks possessed . She was the only one who had the recklessness to take her own way . They answered some secret she had always known . It was different from that hidden sense of personal knowledge with which she had gone creeping about the narrowstreets , drinking in her first sight of queer little places and foreign things on that cold , bleak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of recognition , so private it was almost shameful  --  as if all that were something to which she belonged , and yet never could belong ; for when she came to it , it was past . But here was something so ancient and deep and true that it went far back beyond personal recognition . It was so ancient that she felt it was eternal  --  the revelation of an ancient truth . " Oh , Bruce , I love it here ! " She clutched him , and laid her head against his arm . She gave a long , rapturous sigh . Why could n't they stay here where they had found the place they loved ? Because it was wrong to the real reality , the only one she could truly own  --  a denial of this revelation of beauty , a cowardly failure to live up to the greatest thing they could feel  --  if they let themselves be governed by what other people had built around them , and succumbed to that . The whole morning world lay before them . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faced ; but the gold of the sunshine dazzled it out of existence . In this strange , beloved land they were free again , with the illusion of belonging only to each other . They turned down a long narrow road beside a bright little running stream with the tender green of poplar leaves above it . They seemed to have left all involvements behind them and to be driving into a world so old that it was all freshness . Margot thought of spring at home  --  herself and Dorothy gatheringwildflowers in the woods near the farm  --  after a rain , the red maple buds on the wet , dark sidewalks . But that kind  |p427of  weather had always left her aching and dissatisfied . Somehow , she had wanted to push the soft , lowering heaviness of the clouds aside , as if they were getting between her and some essence of the season . This was what she really loved ! She watched a dry swirl of dust across a waste of desert . These were only the pale rudiments of the early summertime , archaic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a world older than any of which she had ever dreamed . Beyond the stream and the line of poplar trees lay the pueblo . An Indian was out working in the field . He did not look up as they drove past , with the familiar curiosity of the farmers at home , a little dubious of strangers but ready to be friendly , to raise the hand in a salute a little slower than the one given them . His back , in its red-checked shirt , was bent with a stern ease ; and his long black bob swung forward under the red band about his head . Margot admired his indifferentreserve , too natural and poised to suggest surliness . The earth showed straight patterns of bright young corn , like the earth at home ; but because this was far away , and the farmer an Indian , it seemed beautiful to Margot here . Far in the dreamy distance , the mesas reared their cut-off tops at different levels , giving a romantic isolation to the small fertile space of the young cornfield . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There had never been such stillness  --  such utter , sunny , ancient peace . The earth-colored houses , with their softly rounded contours , the ladders bleached hard and firm in the dry pure air , clustered around the sunburned space . A dog the color of the tan dust was lying in a doorway . Women with twig brooms were sweeping the dry earth . The far-off , dim-blue mesas , the mountainsstill more dim and far away , and dark with cedars , seemed to endow the movements of the women with a rudimentary human grandeur and significance . They left the car beside the little Spanish church behind white palings . The white wooden crosses in the burying ground just beyond were thrust up thick and crookedly with a primitivestarkness . Margot and Bruce walked slowly across the plaza in its enchantment of morning stillness . P428An old woman was standing in an open doorway looking at them with small , dark , unrevealing eyes . As they started to go past , she said in a level , emotionless voice : " Come in . Buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He smiled at her , indulging her feminine weakness for looking and buying . But it was really more to see the way the place looked inside than to purchase anything that she wanted to accept the invitation . She stepped through the low doorway , looking about her in enchanted wonder . Bruce followed her and stood smilingly aside . She turned to him with an expression of delight , with a deep , rapturous sparkle in her dark eyes . This was the room of which she had always dreamed , so exactly as she had always seen it that she could not believe she was actually here : the low room , with its dry still air , the place dark on the inside with the burning sun outside . She had n't seen just what would be here , but now she knew that everything was completely as it must be . It was simple in an elemental way , but with a sense of true selection in the few furnishings  --  no clutter of what was irrelevant , impersonal , unchosen . She loved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The round vigas overhead gave a scent of wood and bark . The white fireplace in the corner was deeply burned inside to a sooty blackness . There were only women in this place  --  the old woman who had called them in , one middleaged , and two younger . One of these held a baby with black square-cut hair and soft , black , gleaming almond eyes . " It 's a doll ! " Margot cried in rapture . She felt that she adored dark little babies  --  they had none of the milkiness of the fat white ones with their light little wisps of hair . She turned to make Bruce look , turning back eagerly to the woman who held the baby , innocently unaware of the constraint of Bruce 's smile . The women looked at each other in stealthy pleasure , and broke into bubbling laughter . The sound was as soft as doeskin . Everything was soft about them  --  their broad faces , the gleam of their dark eyes , their almost soundless steps on the earthen floor . And yet they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nobody could deny that ! They were all secret , all together . This was a woman 's hidden stronghold . The intimacy of glances told enough , no words were needed . The youngest one was silently placing various-sized pieces of pottery on the floor , earth-colored , with great flower patterns . Margot bent to pick up a bowl , adoring its earthen coolness , its lovely , hand-made unevenness . " Do you want it ? " Bruce asked her . " Of course I want it ! I want everything . " He was already asking " How much ? " The women turned to each other , laughing again , a half-abashed laughter that seemed to share a secret . " Fifty cent ' , " the old woman said . The soft , spontaneous laughter bubbled up again as if out of some hidden spring of peaceful , secret , deep harmony . They all exchanged glances from under their black eyelashes . " What will I do with it ? " Margot asked . " Well , you have it , " Bruce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Margot repeated blissfully . They walked slowly past the houses . " Oh , Bruce , I want to live here ! " Margot moaned . He smiled at her , and let her clasp his large firm hand . She cried passionately , " I do . " How could she tell him ? He was pleased and smiling , enjoying the strangeness , but because it was strange , and had no connection with the life that he called real . Was that the way he thought of her too ? Margot looked quickly up at him in fright . But his face had a tender look , although its lines were stern . She clung more tightly to his hand . What she felt was , that she had found her home . These were houses that belonged to women , houses they themselves had made , not places that had been made for them : soft , uneven , standing as they had grown , not built to carefully calculated specifications . And they had stood longer than any other houses in the whole land ! Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the metal hardness that was coming into the world . She knew that she had always been afraid of it ; the great iron of machinery that was overwhelming all the small , intimate , P430irrelevant things . If it were to be all calculation instead of spontaneity ! Then she would n't care to live any longer . Now she thought back with horror to the great skyscrapers with their metal doors , their hard shining spaces on which her heels made sharp , resistant sound , the intricate muffled mechanism that was beneath their towering magnificence . It seemed as if women were being driven back to a place like this ; and again she thought with longing of the bubbling spontaneity of the Indian laughter in the intimate darkness of that room . " I want to live here , " she repeated . You do ! " Bruce gently mocked her . They were going along hand in hand . " I do , I want to dress the way they do , and eat from bowls that I love , not just dishes you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Bruce was still gently mocking . He swung her hand . " This is the way women can live . " " Women depend on the luxuries men get for them , " Bruce told her sententiously . " Wait until you see your hair get straight and your teeth drop out . Then you would n't be so contented . What 's all this grousing I 've been hearing about the beauty parlors along the way , that did n't know how to cut a woman 's hair  --  " " That was in the Middle-west , " Margot said with scorn . " Maybe you can start up a beauty parlor in the pueblo ! " Margot was silent . He thought it was a joke , because these people were Indians , and so he , as a good American , had to be facetious about them . He could n't see . No , it was n't a joke ! Bruce was within the enchantment too . She could feel the sense of happiness that was mounting , mounting . . . Bruce pretended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now he had withdrawn his hand and he was tightly clasping hers . She wanted this  --  she wanted it . It was like something that had always been hers and that was lost until today . It was far more hers than home . In this enveloping stillness and peace , movements , impulses , seemed to come from the inside . At home , Margot thought rebelliously , everything was put on from theP431outside . Even in New York . In New York worse than anywhere ! She had loved it when she went there first ; but now she felt that she could never bear to go back . " But you like it ? " she said wistfully to Bruce , feeling how different his ideas were from hers , liking them and hating them because they were so much the regulation American-man kind . " It 's nice , all right , " Bruce admitted . He gave a sidelong , appraising look about the place . There was a kind of pain in his voice . His hand tightened on Margot 's . The silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it  --  until she drew away her hand . " Want something else ? " Bruce asked her . His voice held a breathlessness . He loved to make her gifts . No doubt it was partly a sense of reparation  --  a desire to heap on her all he could in their brief time together . . . if it was to be brief . But she loved it just the same . The way , up in the mountains , he had stuck first a red flower and then a yellow flower into her hair  --  as if he could never get enough of the sight of her in different aspects , different colors . " Maybe we can find some of this silver jewelry to deck you out . A fellow told me you could run across better things in these pueblos than you can in town . " Bruce was looking around . Margot loved the air of masculineauthority with which he did it , although she knew it was alien to the place , and gave them the air of foreign conquerors . She had exclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen , feeling that it was what she had always been meant to wear ; and Bruce had noted it , and been cannily turning over possibilities in his mind . A young woman was standing in front of one of the houses . Bruce went over to her , and then beckoned to Margot , as she stood waiting in the sunshine . " This girl says she has a few rings . Want to look at them ? " The young Indian woman went through the open doorway and came back with a handful of silver rings and a necklace of turquoise which she held out in soft , questioning silence . Bruce examined the things with his usual appraising thoroughness . He held up one of the rings , squinting at it , and thenP434damp-feeling old adobe walls in the piazza with its columns carefully carved in Mission style . " Looks kind of Greenwich Villagey to me , " Bruce said . He looked dubiously at the waitresses in crisp , light-green smocks , carrying trays of tall , misted glasses of iced tea with cuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , Bruce ! " Margot said . She liked the Indian chair with its thong seat which Bruce held for her , and the horehound-brown Mexican glassware and the yellow sugar bowl with its childish , painted flowers . She stared avidly around the court , seeing first the groups of people around the tables , and envying the woman with the sharply cut profile who could pull back her gray hair that way , and so stunningly wore the scarlet velvet jacket and the enormous belt of round silver Indian discs . If they stayed here much longer , she must have one of those jackets and one of those belts , to go with the ring and bracelet and heavy silver earringsthat Bruce had bought her . It was the kind of dress that fitted this country and fitted her , and she could already feel herself , like that woman , boldly making her own the brilliantcolor and the heavy ornament . Margot 's eyes roved to little shops around the court , in the windows of which she saw the Indian and Mexican handicraft , etchings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the region . She felt the group of people as intimates of the country , who made this a meeting place ; and she was confirmed in this when a young Indian in a square bob and orange shirt padded across the court , and they began talking to him familiarlyin a mixture of Spanish and English . " When will there be the Eagle Dance , Juan ? " " Mebbe Buffalo . " " Quando ? " " Mebbe next week . You come Thursday , " the Indian said with calm friendliness . They were standing about him , examining his strings of turquoiseand bracelets as he stood stolidly impervious to their patronizing remarks .  | " No , Juan , not good , " drawled a thin youth in a beret and a red sash . He negligently handed back the string of beads . Margot was looking at the youth when his eyes lazily met hers . He detached himself from the group and came toward Margot 's table . " Margot Ferguson ! " His large eyes examined her familiarly , and there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were coming here , Margot , " he drawled . " Hello , Rod ! I did n't know you 'd come out here . This is Mr. Williams  --  Mr. Pingrey , " Margot said a little coolly . She had no desire to meet Rod here . Somehow it put the wrong kind of color on the group from which he came , about which she had been weaving an exotic and envious interest . She heard Bruce 's chilly " How do you do , " as Rod , with an insolent familiarity , turned his large eyes from one to the other of them . " Margot , how charming you look . There is that je ne sais quoi about you , as of a properly cherished woman . I congratulate you  --  both . " Margot saw the way Bruce stiffened as Rod rolled his eyes toward him . Rod 's silky black side-burns , coming down from under his beret , were lower than ever , and his blue velvet trousers were gashed with red at the bottoms . He had gone artily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Margot said quickly , to cover up the stiffness she knew Bruce was feeling . " I have n't seen you for ages . " Rod negligently picked up Margot 's hand from the table . " Not bad , the ' ring , " he drawled . " It 's an old pattern . But you got hooked on the bracelet . Factory . Me ? " he asked . " I 'm quite established . " He made a wan motion of his hand toward one of the shops . " Mexican things . The best in Santa Fe . You want to be careful of the stuff around the hotels . You should meet Everett  --  most valuable person to know here . Look , he 's the man in the linen trousers . Knows when every dance is going on in the pueblos . One of the few people who have really seen the Penitentes . " Margot saw the short , fat man with the gray mop of hair , P436like an old actor 's , and the hanging pouches under his large eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white trousers . Poor Vernon , what a successor ! But he could probably support Rod more thoroughly than she had done . Rod said , with an intimate smirk and roll of his eyes , " Everett and I are very good friends , you know . He owns all this place . Listen , why do n't you come and meet these people ? Going to be here long ? Everybody stays longer than they expect to . It gets you , you know . You ought to know some of the real people . " Margot looked at Bruce . He was sternly cutting his salad with his fork , with an air of heavy distaste which she could recognize . " Oh , I guess not , Rod , " she said quickly . " We 're just staying quietly here , not seeing anyone . " Rod 's eyebrows arched . " Oh , of course . Pardon me . Just one of those things  --  I understand . Well , you 'll probably be droppinginto the shop some day . I can not know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , with a roll of his eyes . He languidly walked away . " Margot , let 's get out of here , " Bruce said from a tight mouth . " Oh , Bruce , before I finish my salad ? " But she saw the determined set of his jaw and knew when it did n't do to oppose him . She folded her napkin , trying to look nonchalant , while Bruce paid the thin , very refined woman at the desk . " Bruce , I 'm terribly sorry , " she begged , when they got outside . " That awful little squirt of a Rod !  --  who ever dreamed he 'd turn up ? " " Just the kind of place you 'd expect to find him in , " Bruce said . " With that gang of would-be artists . I did n't like it from the first . " " Well , we wo n't go there again . I 'll do the cooking myself . " " Yes , " Bruce said , mocking her . " On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to use the range . And anyway , this is different . "  |p437It  did seem different . When they had driven back through the narrow winding street , that looked as if it had grown from an old Indian trail , and had climbed the sandy arroyo to the place where their low-lying adobe house sat into the hill under the poplar trees , with the pinon like a dark fuzz beyond , and beyond that the blue mountains which seemed so intimate , and yet were twenty miles away : Margot felt a secret little ecstatic sense that this was their home . She almost resented the fact that it belonged to a wealthy artist , and not to them . He was away for the summer , and they had rented the place a month ago through a real estate man . She had come to love the white interior , that was like the pueblo rooms , with the rounded fireplace in the corner , the woody vigas in the ceiling , and beautiful furniture which the artist had made himself . Even Bruce approved it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painter 's house with the blue wooden gate and the old Mission bell above it . They were both affectionate toward the tiny stream that flowed in front of the house between its little thrown-up banks , and which was now a dry trickle , and again a miniature flood of pale brown water  --  depending on how much of the flow the irrigation farms up the valley turned aside , Bruce said . The kitchen was warm from the slowly burning range and fragrant with the beans which had been cooking since yesterday . Margot went to the olla that hung a little pottery mug . She loved the faintly earthen taste of the cool water , and the porous feel of the cup at her lips . She loved to get a drink from the olla  --  just as water seemed to taste better when she got it from some out-of-the-way place , such as the spring in Stumpf 's pasture , next to the Fergusonfarm at home , where the clean sand bubbled in the bottom of the spring . Then she went to the range and lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now turned a rich brown . She poured them into the big , irregular Indian cooking pot , with its zigzag design , added water , and set them in the oven to bake . Maria , the young Spanish-American girl who came in to clean , had taught her how to make the beans P438and chile . She had got to love the sensation of the fiery red sauce , which reminded her of peppery and reckless Spanish qualities . Maria brought in the flat , round tortillas , about which Bruce joked , calling them stacks of cardboard , and declaring that Margot would disdain them if they were served in Americanrestaurants . But he liked them too . He had learned to scoop up his beans with them , the way they had seen a family of Spanish-Americans doing , all solemnly seated under a cottonwoodtree near a stream , with their ancient , high-pockets of a Ford parked near-by . There was an electric stove , beside the range , on which Margot made their breakfast . She loved the intimacy of the long breakfast hour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the lucid freshness of the blue southwestern morning , with the mountains dim and dreamy beyond the long windows . She even liked to give Bruce the best half of the Albuquerque paper , which Bruce always bought , with a somewhatshamefaced look , saying " it was more of a real town than this tourist 's dump "  --  there were better baseball items in the paper . In fact , Margot was getting quite a housewifely feeling . Mother and Dorothy would never have believed it ! But she felt that it was different , because this was Bruce . And it was n't a stodgy marriage . They were to get what there was in it , and then let it go . Only there was so much in it  --  so much more than she had dreamed . Margot was a little fearful of the attachmentthat was growing . Yet she was fiercely resolved to get what there was in it . It had come , now , to the very heart of something sweet , and she realized that it needed this daily life together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the kitchen , it seemed to her to have a flavor and simple dignity of something fundamental , with the scrubbed , unpainted pine-board table upon which a loaf of bread ought to stand  --  a jug , a loaf , and thou . She felt the same revulsion as Bruce at the sort of arty , " atmospheric " tearoomsand bizarre eating places for which she had had a girlish weakness until now . But she seemed to have outgrown all that . She was disgusted at the thought of Rod and his whole gang  --  that awful Everett in the sloppy pants !  --  and she meant to P439stay far , far away from the Mexican shoppe . Why did Rod , of all people , have to turn up here , with his beautiful insolent eyes , reminding her of her past , of Lee , and the smoky basementroom  --  here in this sunshine ? She gave a little shudder . She heard Bruce moving about in the other room , and lookingup , she saw him standing at the door with an amused , fond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " That does n't bother me a bit ! " " Does n't ? " " No . " She came over to him and gave him an ecstatic little hug . " I like it . For you . " She pulled him possessively into the other room and seated him on the low couch , with its old Navajo blanket of faded rose and white and black . " You do think our place is lovely  --  per-fect , do n't you ? " She could never get Bruce to uncover the real depths of his feelings , and she did n't expect it . She knew how he liked to keep a masculine playfulness on the surface , as he let his lavish care for her stand for profession , imply his feeling underneath . She was content with the half-playful , half-painful look that came into his eyes as he squeezed her arm and then stared through the window . " We wo n't go to that goofy little place again . I do n't like it any better than you do . I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cook all our meals-honestly , I would . We can get Maria to come in when we want her . And then we would n't have to run into people , but we could drive to the pueblos  --  I just have n't begun to get enough of the country . Have you ? Bruce , answer ! " She shook his arm . " Oh , Bruce , " she said , with a sudden sweet overflow of feeling , " did you ever think it would come to as much as this ? I did n't know anything could . " Bruce shook his head . Margot felt her eyes swimming as she looked intently at his face , the structural lines of which had become so familiar and necessary to her . She felt the imprint of his features like something bred into her . There was a sudden strange yearning inside of her , quite different from simple desire . She said in a wondering voice , " I can even see why women want children  |  --  of someone they really love . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . Bruce was silent . Margot quickly felt that it had struck a wrong note . She was angry suddenly , and frightened . The silence throbbed between them . Bruce got up , drawing away his arm , and walked gravely about the room . He stopped and looked down at her with a tightened face . " Margot , " he said with difficulty , " look here . We 've got to . . . decide some things pretty soon . " " Oh , Bruce ! Why did you have to say that right now ? " The tears in her eyes overflowed . She felt a willful anger at the thought of making decisions . She hated them . They seemed wrong . She wanted events to decide things of themselves . " Well , I 've got to say it some time . " " Bruce  --  it was just that little bastard Rod !  --  You 've been rattled ! " She could n't believe that this was touching the thing she dreaded ! Margot sat silent . She looked at the wicker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . " Bruce , you have n't thrown them away ! " She ran to the basket and retrieved the pictures with a little moan . Bruce 's painting had been one of the reasons they had given for their stay here , for their taking the house . He had always wanted a free space in which to do the things for which he had never had time . Margot had been happy seeing him set his small easel on the terrace , and she had watched with little cries of appreciation as his tentative brushes labored at reproducing the look of the mountains or the rambling Spanish farms across the valley . But now , as she looked up , and saw the faintly cynical look he bent down on her , she checked her lamentation . " They 're junk , " Bruce said . " It 's too late for me to go in for that sort of thing . Even your friend Rod could do better . Earlier I might have  --  I do n't know . But now it 's just make-believe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and threw them at the wastebasket . Margot could n't say anything . They were n't good . She knew P441it as well as Bruce . But he might do something good if he kept on  --  she felt now as if Bruce could do anything . Anyway , she had been happy feeling that Bruce was having this period when everything that he had missed in his too-early taking on of responsibilities would come to a perfect flowering  --  and through her . She felt a crushed sense at Bruce 's turning on it , and she could n't protest . Tears overflowed again in her great , staring eyes . Bruce made an uneasy movement . " There 's too much makebelievearound here , anyway . It 's beginning to get under my skin . " Now she looked up at him tragically . Yet she knew that she held power over him , and she said , daring him to deny it , " But what we have together is n't make-believe . Is it ? " Bruce winced a little and his face turned color . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid it is n't . " " Afraid ? " " Margot , look here  --  " " I do n't want to look here . I do n't want to see you tear up pictures and tell me 4i 'm nothing but make-believe . Like Rod , I suppose . I suppose you think I really belong with him ! " " Margot  --  " " Oh , please do n't say anything . " She clung to him again , and he held and kissed her remorsefully . " Not today , not today  --  not when everything 's so beautiful . Not unless you do n't love me any more . I do n't care what you say then . " Bruce admitted , after a rueful moment , " Then I guess I 'll have to keep still . " She looked up at him . He was smiling . They kissed again , in a long , silent reunion . But the vigilant fear , which had been lulled for a while by their happiness in this place , was all awake again , strained and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she knew that she was not surprised . Neither of them had slept . For a little while , they seemed to have made up , to have been happy together . But it was not true , and both of them knew it . Their supper of beans and chile , which she had meant to be such a P442success , was a failure . Bruce had been indrawn , with a farawaylook in his eyes . And afterwards , when she had told him that he need n't help her with the dishes , he had said , " All right "  --  with relief , it seemed to Margot . When she had gone into the studio , he was reading his mail , of which he had got a great batch forwarded this afternoon . He was thinking of either his business or his family , she did n't know or care which . But anyway , it had come between them , and she hated him . She felt him coming toward her . " Margot , are you awake ? " " Yes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bruce , in his robe , sat huddled on a chair by her bed . IVlargot 's heart began to beat heavily . It choked her , so that she was afraid she could n't speak . She did n't want to hear  --  she would n't listen . . . but in horror , she could n't help it . Bruce took a deep breath . " Listen here , Margot  --  we 've got to break it up . " They were the words that she had dreaded . She was hearing them now . " We . . . we ca n't trust ourselves any further . " Those monstrous words had been spoken  --  and by Bruce . Margot lay like a black living coal of resentment . Once she had meant to speak them  --  if they were to be spoken . But now it seemed wrong that they should be said at all . When Bruce tried to touch her , she drew away bitterly . They felt so utterly different about this , as about other things ; there could be no mutual understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Bruce , sensitive to her angry withdrawal , said brokenly , " You think I do n't love you , because I 'm saying this . If you knew what this takes ! " Yet her resentment flamed again , as she dwelt sullenly , broodingly , on what he had said . He could n't love her , as she knew love . He could n't feel that it could be put aside this way , after what there had been between them . It mattered to her more than anything . It was n't love if it did n't . He could n't understand as she understood what it meant to " give all to love . " Bruce was talking , and she felt the suffering in his voice , P443but she was set against him inside , and hardly heard what he was saying . She felt sealed up . There was no use talking or trying to explain . She gave a little moan and buried her head in the pillow . " Christ , if it was only that I did n't love you ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of my orbit . I do n't know myself any more  --  that 's the truth . You need n't think this is just a business man 's pastime ! " Bruce said accusingly . " I never was the kind who went in for pastimes . You know that , do n't you ? Yes , you know it well enough ! You made me feel from the start it was something different . That was why it meant so much to me . It was something I never expected to find in this life . " Was something , " Margot said bitterly . She did n't care whether she was fair or not . Her heart was too sore . " You just want to put it away , get it over with now . You ca n't love me . Because I 'm willing for it to go on , and you are n't . " " But , Margot . There is some difference between us  --  in circumstances . Do n't you see ?  --  I feel all the responsibility . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those were Bruce 's old notions  --  still between them . " Do n't you suppose a woman takes a chance ? " She felt her fierce recklessness , the thing that had made her rebel against all the Ferguson cautiousness . " I take every chance , I 'm glad to ! It does n't mean anything to me if it is n't every-thing . But you . . . when I said that to you  --  this afternoon . . . you were scared . " Margot sobbed , as if she had been holding her breath too long . Only now she saw  --  she began to see  --  of what he was depriving her . It could never , never come to the perfect final flowering . Not now . Bruce sat humbly . " Well , call it that , " he said after a moment , very quietly . " You see , I have a wife and two children , Margot . You have to know what that means , what it lets a man in for . " " It could n't stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Margot said fiercely . But she was stiff with anger at the mention of his wife . The word made her hate him . There was a beseeching note in Bruce 's voice  --  and a little of P444hurt resentment too . " Margot , " he told her , " you 've got to see it a little from my side . I do n't think you realize how little you go outside your own feelings . You hold up love as if it were something apart from people . That 's all right for you . You can do as you please . You have n't anyone else to think of . It ca n't be just the same for me . You 've never been willing to look at my situation . Or what it meant to me , what I was doing . I 've tried to do what would make you happy  --  what you said you wanted . You said you did n't want marriage . " " I do n't ! It is n't that I 'm talking about . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ought to stay together  --  not let other things come between . " But Margot felt the hurt of what Bruce had said to her . The folks had said it too . " Margaret thinks her tastes are sacred . " She could set herself against them , and disregard what they said . But when Bruce said it , it jarred her with a shock of truth . It was as if she were all tender and vulnerable where he was concerned . " It was all for you , " Bruce repeated . " Every bit of it . And ever since I knew you . You knocked me clear off my base , I tell you . " His voice rose in suffering . " I 've gone with you as far as I could . Now you wo n't see how it is with me . " He stood up abruptly . " You 've never looked at me , " he accused her . " Just at the man who could make you happy . " Margot cried furiously that it was n't true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its truth breaking into her , leaving her without resources . She fought blindly against it . Bruce had been walking about . Now he went out of the room . Margot felt herself alone in a pit of raw suffering . Without Bruce , she simply did not see how she could live . Everything was gone out in blackness . She could bear the sight of nothing , now that she had seen all the living world illuminated by his love for her . She felt wildly that it was something truly beyond her  --  not in glory now , but in a paralyzing fear . She did n't know what she could do . She would rush out to him  --  change him , make him accept her feelings as his . But she could n't move , no more than in a dream . She lay tryingP445to subdue her torture to the mere possibility of existing from moment to moment . After a while , Bruce came back . He tried to lie down beside her and take hold of her . She felt his wet face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " we ca n't keep on like this . We 're fooling ourselves . It 's going to get beyond us . " By now , she hated him too much . She felt again of what he was depriving her . Even Lillian could have children ! Bruce did n't want a child by her . " Because I know all about this , " he whispered . He tried to stroke her hair . " Do n't you see , Margot ? We ca n't just go into things like that . You made me remember that I have children . I ca n't go back on them . I 'm their father . They trust me . I ca n't tell you what that means . Not if you ca n't see it . And I do n't suppose you can . " Margot was silent . " Well , I had to have this much of you , " he said brokenly again . " Whether I did wrong or not . I do n't know . I ca n't help it . Have n't I given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was still stiff and silent against him . After a while she whispered , turning away from him , " But you told me you loved me better than anything in the world , you 'd never known what love could be . " " That 's true . " It could n't be true , Margot felt wildly , through a torture of whirling darkness . To speak of parting now was a betrayal of the revelation of their love . The only right there could be was to go on and follow it through to the end . She did n't care if they died together ! She would rather die with Bruce . She began to sob . " If it had meant to you what it did to me , you could n't go , " she tried to tell him . " All right . " Bruce was crying too . " Think it does n't mean the same to me . " Margot muttered sullenly : " It ca n't mean the same to a man . They do n't know what it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole life to pieces P446to give you what you wanted most . My business  --  and everything else . " Margot was silent , feeling again the fear of admitting that as truth . Bruce got up . She was listening to him with a terrible acuteness . He seemed to be talking to himself . " But I ca n't go on with it . I ca n't go back on them . Maybe I do n't put love as high as you do . I know I ca n't go back on my children , for another child . And that 's what it would come to  --  would have to . Do n't you see , I could n't be anything afterwards , no good to you or anyone . . . " " You said we could live together . " She saw the sunshine on the earth-colored pueblos .. . the peace in the plaza square . " Well , I meant it . God knows ! But , Margot  --  " " Now if you go I 'll die . " It was n't a threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She could n't look into that blackness with Bruce gone . It made her scream out in fear . " Margot , do n't torture me that way ! " Bruce was crying again . " You do n't want me if I 'm all broken to pieces . I could n't undertake to be anything to you  --  not if I . . . I 'm afraid of what it would do to me . I could n't stand up under it , Margot , if I lost all my self-respect  --  and trustworthiness . . . I ca n't just do it for my own happiness . " But for her , happiness was the criterion ! It was the only thing that was right . And she was to count less , just because she had given him happiness  --  had let him into that heaven they had shared together in the mountain stillness ! He was against her . He was not hers . He belonged with other people . He was walking around the room now , blindly . " Go now , then ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more . " " I will . " He stopped that blind walking . She had made him do that , anyway . She could hear his heavy breathing . " I 've got to go now . I may not be able to do it . I 've got to . You see that , do n't you , Margot ? I 'm just myself . I 'm what I am . I ca n't help it . "   " Oh , go away . Do n't talk . Not a single thing matters . " Bruce went . Even while she was driving him away , she had n't believed that he could go . Margot sank back into that pit of suffering . She believed , quite truly , that she was dying . She did nothing to stem the tide of her suffering , and there was nowhere else that it could bear her . But still she lived on from moment to moment . Then the din of her own inner pain seemed to fade out and leave her in an acuteness of listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margot rose up in her shock of resentment at that impossible actuality . She could almost feel the feverish trembling of his haste . A shoe dropped , and she heard him curse . His clothes  --  hers , the things she loved , the dark green tie that gave a sea-green tinge to his eyes , the rough tweed coat  --  how could they be the property of a woman he loved less than he did her ? Why was the one most loved the one who must suffer ? Bruce could actually leave her . Margot felt alone and hideously insignificant in the great blackness that was left all around her . The blackness surged over her , in helpless waves of agony . She had meant to " know suffering "  --  but not sufferinglike this . Not raw and actual , piercing to her marrow , turning her bones to water and her flesh to agony . Then she leaned on her arm again in that hideous acuteness of listening . Every tiny , actual sound she seemed to have to hear . And yet she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room again , toward her , she felt as if her hands were beating the air and she was shrieking " Do n't come near me ! " although the whole time she was lying fiercely still . Bruce came in and stood beside her in the semi-darkness . " Margot . " She heard the strangled suffering in his voice . Was glad to hear it !  --  and then suffered herself because she could n't comfort him . He sat down on the bed and tried to take her hand . He had something of his old protective , responsible manner back . He was telling her what he had thought of for her . " I want you to keep on this house . Stay here just as long as you want to  --  just as long as you can . You said you loved the country . If you want to stay out here altogether . . . why , I guess I can manage that . " She made a movement of denial .  | " I 'm leaving some money for you . It 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Margot , while I tell you where it is . " " I wo n't listen ! " " You 've got to . I wo n't go away and leave you flat . You ca n't ask it of me . I wo n't do it . " She had to hear , although she tried to hold her hands against her ears . " And I 'm going to leave you the car too . " " You ca n't . I wo n't have it . I do n't want to see it . " " All right , " he said , after a while . " I 'll take it away then . " " If you do n't I 'll take it out and wreck it ! " " Margot . Margot , please ! Do n't torture me more than you have to . By God , I do n't think I deserve this ! " She feebly beat at him . " Go away ! " But he stayed , and tried to make her promise  --  she would write him if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would look after herself . He trusted her . She thought that much of him . And they both had this time to remember  --  just as she had said . Margot tried to be deaf . She hated his care  --  hated him to think of these little things , when he could do the final cruelty to her . At the last minute , she took hold of him . He had to break away from her . She heard , in horrified amazement , the sound of his great , broken sobs . " I have to do it . Oh God , I ca n't if I stay any longer . Margot , let me go . I ca n't . " He got up , went blindly to the door . She heard him still crying  --  a man 's fearful crying , that rocked the universe . She listened to it with her eyes open in horrified amazement . After a long time , she heard the sound of the car . She got up , and struggled after him . Bruce was gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beg him to stay . . . anything . . . she could n't stand it alone , that was all .... She ran along the road a little way , slipping on the ruts in the darkness . After a while , she could n't hear the car any more  --  nothing but the little stream , and the night-time rustling of the cottonwood leaves . She stood in horrified loneliness , listening to those sounds . Then she felt her drained weakness . She could n't get back to P449the house . She could n't even throw herself into the stream and let the shallow water cover her . Bruce 's words stopped her  --  the sick remembrance of the suffering in his voice . That was more to her than her own impulse . But she did n't care what she did . She was beyond that . It seemed to her truly that the end of the world had come . She lay flat down on the rough ground in the chill mountain night while her suffering seemed to bear her somewhere  --  she did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the earth . There was a tinge of light over the mountains now . Cars were going past . Someone would look over and see her  --  perhapstry to come to her aid , ask her what was the matter . She felt dragged out now , not alive . But if she were going to die , she did n't want to be found here . She got up , sauntering as if she had just come into the garden for some flowers , went into the house and stealthily closed the door , and lay down on the bed . MARGOT woke up with a sense of rest . It was like a dream to be back in her old room . Her own curtains were at the window , carefully laundered ; and the rickety little desk stood locked as she had left it . The folks had kept everything for her exactly as it had been before  --  hoping , she supposed , that she would finally come home . She felt the blessed ease of lying in her bed and letting things go . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a refuge . But this half-pleasant sensation lasted for only a few seconds . Now she was awake , and already the sharp grind of pain was beginning  --  in her mind , in her breast . . . somewhere . She felt the empty horror of lying here alone . Hunger for Bruce consumed her . She would have screamed out if she could  --  only it was too sharp and absorbing for her to make a cry . It took all the life she had just to lie and feel and contemplate  |p450its  completeness . There was an interval when again it seemed to Margot that she simply could not live on from moment to moment . It passed  --  more or less . Suddenly she got out of bed . She had heard sounds downstairs . Bun dashed into the house and out again with a slam of the front door . The sound hurt Margot , wounded her with its careless ease . It said that to Bun this place was home . And to her it was n't . No place could be . She sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white walls of the adobe house that no longer belonged to her  --  not the house , nor the dreamy mountains , nor the little shallow stream . There was no use in dressing , in doing anything , with Bruce gone from her life . It had lost both center and background . Every time that Margot looked at her existence she realized more the extent of the devastation . But another sound made her get up quickly again and act to herself as if she had been dressing all this time . If she did n't hurry , mother would come up to see what was the matter . Anything was better than breaking down before the folks . That painful , hard determination was all that kept her up now . It was all that was left of her pride . She knew that her mother did n't entirely believe in her account of the trip , although mother tried and pretended , resolved to have everything beautifulbetween them this time . She had told mother that she had gone West with some friends of Grimmie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If she could have seen this last crowd  --  ! Hec , her gallant suitor , who had expected to spend his nights with her , thinking that of course he could do as he pleased with a girl from New York who was running around alone out West . Rod , no doubt , had told him about Bruce , and put his own sweet interpretation upon the story . And no doubt about Lee , too , and a few other things . . . Ugh ! When Margothad been with strangers she had longed for someone of her own ; but here at home , meeting all these eyes , she wanted strangers again . She dressed as quickly as she could , shuddering away from her memories of this room . She had thought that now she was forever superior to those memories . But she was n't . It seemedP451to her that she had gone back into the old chill , shaded loneliness . She felt too hideous for any but her oldest dress . And of course she had to find Aunt Ella downstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having quite a sleep . " Aunt Ella 's dull black eyes were looking at her curiously . Since Margot had come home this time , Aunt Ella seemed to regard her partly as a stranger . Half the time Aunt Ella was formal , the rest of the time too familiar . " That 's just what I want her to do , " mother said , with a quick , anxious , conciliatory smile . " Well ! Let 's see how you look by daylight . I ai n't had a peek at you yet except by night . I want to see if you look as stylish as you did over at our house . I was afraid to speak to you ! Well , you look a little older , " Aunt Ella observed with satisfaction . " I do n't know how all the girls manage to hide their age these days . But it 's beginning to show a little round your eyes . " " She 'll look better when she 's rested , " mother said again quickly , smiling . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What 's the matter ? Run it all off ? You ought to have quite a lot more heft to you by this time . You ought to see Edna Mae Fawcett . Was n't she one of those girls you used to play with ? My , she 's getting an awful behinder on her ! I was just noticing that when I saw her going down the street . " " I do n't care for a behinder , thank you ! " " Oh , well , " mother said , anxiously smiling again , " she 'll have several more pounds before we let her go . " Margot went on into the dining room . Mother had a woman out on the screened porch , ironing , and so her place had been set in here . Any walls were better than to be left to the awful vacancy of the outdoor light . On her first day at home , there had been a sort of freshness of renewal . It had seemed as if here she could hide and rest . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd , whose belated antics she had long ago outgrown , with the very beginning of her love for Bruce . She remembered her dry despair at the idea of returning P452to that . Hec , with his gin and his hang-overs and his pumped-up hilarity , the unwelcome zeal of his disappointed love-making ! For a few sweet hours , she had felt at home in this place and renewed by its innocent charm . But now it was just another restless sojourn . It was too late to make up the old quarrel . Too much had happened between . For a moment she almost pitied the folks and their transparent efforts , mother 's anxious kindness , dad trying to make up with her and pretend that nothing was ever wrong . She felt as if she could have cried over their innocence . Margot sat down and stared at her glass of orange juice . The perception that mother was using the prettiest dishes for her only made her feel worse ; the pathos of these little conciliatoryefforts , as if she , Margot , were still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go on without Bruce , to do so much as lift her hand to her mouth . She drank the orange juice quickly , with aversion , so that mother would see that the glass was empty . But she could n't get farther with the breakfast than slightly to move her spoon back and forth in the bowl of cornflakes and rich cream . Thank God , Aunt Ella was still there so that mother would n't come out and offer to cook her an egg ! She saw that mother had given her , for her coffee , the little spoon with the calla lily handle . Her dry eyes ached with the effort for tears . Margot pushed the spoon aside . It belonged to Dorothy . Yes , she thought bitterly , she had come to admit it : Dorothywas the one who had everything . Margot sat staring into dreariness . The crazy trip with that lousy crowd had dazed her , kept her in motion , held at bay the actuality of her pain . But now it only sickened her to remember the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with herself that she could n't be worse than she was . But she had proved one thing that she thought fiercely she would like to tell a few of these people who were writing books : when a woman had really had the man she loved , if she did love him , she need n't think she could work it off with a bunch of others . No wonder women in the old days had become nuns ! She wished she could hate Bruce  --  oh , she wished she could hate him . But when she dreamed of forgetting him , the worldP453seemed to revolve dizzily and leave an abyss . She clung with both hands to the edge of the table . She could have nothing else while she remembered  --  but there would be still more nothingif it all were gone . She heard mother and Aunt Ella talking in the living room , and it made her detest them . It made her feel wild and at bay . If they really knew about her , they would put her out of the house . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be able to keep Uncle Ben , when they were bickering all the time , just because she wore a wedding ring !  --  while she herself and Bruce , who loved each other , had to be apart . The folks would call it " too bad "  --  the eternal bickering  --  but they would think it perfectly right for Aunt Ella and Uncle Ben to be together . The front doorbell rang with sharp carelessness . Margot 's heart literally did stand still . Her hope , discredited even while she felt it , hurt so that she began to hum loudly , in order not to be able to listen . But there was no sound of Bruce 's voice . She heard Aunt Ella 's exclamations of wonder ; and then her mother called , " Margaret ! " When she had first come home , it had been good to be greeted as " Margaret " and to drop back for a little while into her girlhood . But now when she heard mother call her that , she hated it , for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margot . " And she hated the folks because she could n't tell them about Bruce . But there was still a little grain of sick hope left . When she went into the living room , and saw the long flower box , the hope grew suddenly so immense that it choked her . The boy who had brought the flowers read out loudly : " Mar-gott Ferguson ! ' " Margot saw their bewilderment . Aunt Ella said , " Here , we ca n't make this out . Seems to be for somebody we never heard of ! Still , they ai n't any other Fergusons in town . " The boy said the flowers had come " by telegraph . " " Hurry up , Margaret , open ' em up , " Aunt Ella said . She was all eyes . And mother was just as eager although she was trying to subdue it . Margot opened the long box . Her hands were cold and sheP454felt that she was trembling . She tried angrily to beat back her expectation . But she was sick all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green tissue paper and glanced at it . She had known even before she looked ! Yet the disappointment was so terrible  --  and so absurd !  --  that the whole room was swimmingaround her . She threw down the card . " Are n't you going to open it up ? " her mother asked . " Maybe she do n't want us to see it , " Aunt Ella suggested . " Must be pretty serious when it comes by telegraph . " Margot saw how excited they both were . She languidly laid open the green paper and took out the huge bunch of bright pink roses . Bright baby pink !  --  the very shade she hated . She had a wild impulse to laugh . This was such a perfect offering from Hec ! But she remembered the deep red roses in her room  --  her own roses  --  Frances standing with them at the head of the painted stairs . . . . The world was too awful to endure . All that was gone . Margot could scarcely bring herself to glance at these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother and Aunt Ella . Mrs. Entwhistle had come into the room , doubtless hearing the commotion , and she was staring too in admiration . " My  --  but are n't they pretty ! " " Do you remember Margaret , Mrs. Entwhistle ? " " Oh , yes , I remember her . " Mrs. Entwhistle nodded briskly . " She 's the one that used to be in the library ! " Margot tried to smile , to make them think she was properly delighted  --  to hide herself from them . It seemed as if the room was filled with women . But there was a dreary solace in their excitement . She could see that now they looked at her with increased respect . Even mother ! To mother , Dorothy was still her colleague , and Margot was still the spinster daughter . " Are n't you going to tell us who these came from ? " Aunt Ella demanded . " What about that card ? Do n't you think she ought to pass it over to us ? You know anything about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother looked at her half timidly , but smiling . " You can see it , " Margot said carelessly . P455She flipped the card onto Aunt Ella 's lap . Let Aunt Ella make what she could out of it ! " Oh , no , I guess we better not , " Aunt Ella protested , somewhatscandalized . " Go ahead ! " Aunt Ella read aloud ponderously , " Bee-reaved without you . All nature mourns . Hec . ' Is that right ? That 's what it says . Is that a name ? " " Kind of a one , " Margot said disdainfully . " Sounds funny . " " The real name is Hector . " " Hector ? Is that a man 's name ? I thought it was a dog 's . Why , Roy Hatch has got a dog named Hector . " " Well , there is n't much difference , " Margot said , with acid pleasure . But she was remorseful , seeing mother give her a confused , anxious look . Aunt Ella repeated , " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telegraphs , whatever his name is . Annie , we want to look out . Margaret may surprise us by getting married yet . " She frankly surveyed Margot . Margot shrugged her shoulders . Mother was still puzzled . " But how do you suppose they got your name like that ? " she asked . Aunt Ella chimed in again . " Yes , ai n't that funny ! ' Margott . ' Whoever heard of a name like that ? It 's worse than the other . I should think the greenhouse would have known who you are . " Well , I expect maybe the telegram  --  " " Yes , but the greenhouse ought to have known who she was . Cliff Taylor ought to have lived long enough in this town for that . " Margot said impatiently , " That is my name . That 's what people call me ! " " Margot ' ? Who calls you that ? " " It is n't ' Margott . ' Mar-got . " " Well , it 's got a t on it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pronounced . It 's French . "   " What you got a French name for ? " Aunt Ella demanded , very humorously . Margot shrugged her shoulders again . " I think it 's a very pretty nickname , " mother said . She had to endure the excitement of all the three females over getting the flowers put into water . Margot hated these roses as she had the geraniums that little red-eared Eddie Whitby had given her once at school , in the days when she was making up romantic stories about the beautiful Gardner Allen . But she felt again that dreary solace in the uproar that the whole thing caused . It had raised her status quite definitely , she saw . Aunt Ella was trying to get her to explain , mother wanting to be told , and hurt because she was n't . Margot said , " Well , I 'm going back to my breakfast . " " I should think you 'd want your flowers with you in there !  --  where you could see them . I would , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You can look at them , " Margot said pointedly . " Well , she takes it coolly , " Aunt Ella observed as Margot left them . " Must be used to getting flowers . " She stared again . Margot stayed in the dining room until she was sure that Aunt Ella was gone . Then she wandered back into the living room . There was the same quivering dreariness everywhere , without Bruce . His absence seemed to stop all action at the center . Margot sat down to the piano , played a few bars , and stopped . " Oh , go on and play , " her mother begged her . " I do n't know anything any more . " " Did n't you ever play in New York ? " " I did n't have any piano . " She got up restlessly , wanting to stave off questions about New York . Mother was hurt because Margot told her so little . But it could n't be helped . Margot turned on the radio , getting bursts of sound from various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hard , bossy voice blared out , disguisedunder a specious sweetness . " And of course you will want the recipe for the ice box cookies , if you do not have it already . I know that each and P457every one of you swears by her own ice box cookies . But even so . Margot snapped off the radio . " Horrors , what a female ! How can you stand it ? " " She gives very good recipes sometimes . I do n't like her voice very well , either , " mother admitted . " But they all talk that way . It is n't so good in the mornings , but in the evenings we get lovely concerts . Dad likes the Eskimo Band . " Margot flopped into a big chair . It was a pain to be spoken to , a pain to be forced to give her attention . But when she was alone she could n't stand the leaden dreariness . Her mother said , " I wish we could have some of the girls over while you 're here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margaret , the girls you used to play with . Your old crowd . " " I never had any crowd . " " Why , yes , you did , " mother said , pained . " You used to play with Edna Mae and Lucille . You 've seen Lucille in New York . It 's too bad she is n't here this summer . Of course the other girls are both married . " " Ca n't they get out ? " Margot asked ironically . " Well , I just meant , they 're busy with their children . And Edna Mae has n't been very well . " She went on quite unconsciouslyto talk about Mildred . " She has three very sweet little children . Of course I do n't see much of her . That young crowd do n't do much but play bridge . But we 'll probably see her at the picnic tonight . " " Is Gardner Allen in the Rotary ? " Good heavens ! " Oh , yes , he 's been in some time . He took his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margot thought sardonically . But she could n't , even now , avoid a twinge of jealousy . Mildred was no doubt the perfect small matron , and had everything she wanted ! She got up restlessly , saying that she was going out on the porch . " All right , " her mother called after her , happily , " I 'll come out with you after I 've looked at my cake . " P458Margot sat down in the swing . The slight motion sickened her . She could n't bear to look out on the lawn  --  to see the tree under which Dorothy had stood to be married . Mother was constantly lamenting , " It 's too bad you could n't have seen Dorothy while you were out West . " " Well , mother , I could n't say where to go . " " No , of course not , if you were with other people . " For a little while , she had thought of going to Dorothy 's . They had always been different , and yet allies . Dorothy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all , Dorothy was married , she was one of the enemies  --  Margot could feel Dorothy judging her in advance . She could n't bear to be " Auntie Margaret " and palaver over the children . And she could n't endure to show herself to such an attractive man as Jesse in any light but that of being radiantly successful . To Jesse , she would still be only the unmarried sister  --  a kind of Sister Anne ! There was n't any refuge . Not anywhere . New York  --  but the old crowd had none of them liked Bruce , they would welcome her back in glee as one who had learned her lesson . She heard Bun go tearing into the house again . " Where 'd you get the flowers ? Gee ! She must have a boy friend . " He said it carelessly , and tore out again , wrapped up in his own concerns . It made Margot feel old . There was nothing she could bear to do , nowhere she wanted to go . She dreaded getting outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always nice to her , in her funny dry way , because she was a Ferguson  --  although Mrs. Morgan liked Dorothybest . And Mrs. Viele was sweet to everyone ! The people in the rented house next door did n't matter . But Margot had met Vanchie one day on the street , had stopped  --  and Vanchie had scarcely greeted her . Vanchie had never forgiven her for deserting the Bellews and not going on with her library course . Why should she have cared so much about Vanchie ? But she did . She had felt stripped and ashamed , losing that old fond adoration . Just as when Mary Lou had gone back on her ! She felt that she could show herself to Vanchie only as careless and successful  --  not maimed and marred . Everywhere , now , she had to go unsupported by the knowledge of Bruce 's care . SheP459felt a shameful dependence on those silly flowers , which would get her by with the family . The morning sunshine was pleasant on the lawn , that was fresh and green after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows . But she was out of tune with it . She had never been in tune . Margot was dressing for the Rotary-Ann picnic . What a dreary joke ! But nearly everything now was a dreary , sardonic joke  --  on her . Her reluctance of the morning had changed to a hard , cynical determination to show people in Belmond that she was n't just Margaret Ferguson any more . She heard her mother busy about the house ; and she felt , with an envy that was both painful and contemptuous , that she would put romanticideas of love out of her life  --  that was the way to be successful  --  she would charm some roaming widower at the picnic and settle down in a home in Belmond . She would be what the folks wanted . It irked her that all these women still spoke in guarded tones about married life before her : Mrs. Viele , the other day , saying archly , " I do n't know whether we ought to be letting Margaret hear these things ! " Margot did n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the same , she wanted to show people . She put on the white silk sports suit with the yellow hat , yellow stockings and white sandals . Yes , earrings , whether they suited this costume or not ! She remembered , with an ironic twist of her mouth , how she had always meant to come back to Belmond in long earrings . Her Indian jewelry , though , she would never wear again . Never the ring which Bruce had put on her hand ! She had a ring , as well as all these ladies , and far more exciting than theirs  --  but of course they would n't see it ! She made up only her eyes and lips . She supposed it would kill the folks if she smoked out there ! They accepted smoking now , as long as she did n't do it before other people . Bun had broken them in to all such things . " Margaret ! There 's someone to see you . " Mother 's voice was pleased and excited . At last someone had called on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It could n't be Bruce  --  or mother 's voice would n't sound that way ; so it could n't possibly be anyone she wanted to see.  |p460Margot  went slowly down the stairs . This morning she had had to fight against reluctance to see a soul , and to tear herself out of her painful absorption . She knew Aunt Ella had gone away saying , " Well , she ai n't any better-natured than she used to be , even if she is better looking . " Aunt Ella could n't get over it that she was better-looking , Aunt Ella 's expectations had been so low . But this afternoon , Margot felt hard , bitter and easy , competent to deal with anything in a sort of contempt of its lack of significance to her . " You have a caller , " her mother said , pleased . A tall , rawboned girl in a badly hung dress was standing just inside the hallway , with her mouth open . " Do you know me ? " She gave an eager , awkward laugh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she heard the excited , foolish pleasure of the tone , Margotwas ashamed because she could n't feel anything better than relief that it was n't somebody worse . For a moment she had had an awful vision of Hec following her here . But it was too easy to impress Ada ! She saw the glisten of admiration in Ada 's vacant eyes . " Well , I should say I do , " Margot said easily . Ada laughed again , abruptly , too pleased , when Margot shook hands . She gave another laugh , and then moistly kissed Margot 's cheek . She seemed delighted because Margot had n't ordered her away . " I would n't hardly have known you , " she said now ; and added with naive enthusiasm , " You certainly do look great . I guess it agrees with you there in New York . " Ada 's eyes glistened still more . For a moment Margot felt a cynical happiness , as she thought that here was one person with whom she would n't change places even to get rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around , see her only as a satellite , as if Ada were actually non-existent except in relation to herself ; but now her own pain opened up to her a vision of Ada 's life as it was in itself , with its meager personal pleasures and its vicarious excitements . Evidently Ada still adored her . She stood holding Margot 's hand , fumbling it in her clumsy fingers . Margot heard the foolish eagerness of herP461laugh . What a mess the world was ! This was only another instanceof the way she attracted a person who could mean nothing to her . Anger at the craziness of existence forced her to smother her impatience , and smile . But she could n't really think of a thing to say , the encounter was so meaningless to her . She asked at random , " What are you doing now ? " " Oh , I keep the books at the implement works now , " Ada said proudly . " It 's a lot nicer being at home here where you know folks and have someone to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Apparently Ada took it for granted that Margot had been keeping up with her history . Margot had n't the faintest idea where " off there " might be . " Are n't you ever coming back here ? " " Does n't look like it , " Margot answered . " You must like it there in New York , " Ada said with her foolish laugh , staring with admiration . Margot smiled . But again she had a troubling vision of Ada 's life , making her interest out of the events of the town from the outskirts , going with " the girls " to the movies and afterwardsgorging themselves on chocolate sundaes at the less populardrug store where they could hide the shame of their aging solitude from the blithe callousness of the high school chits , excited by their adoration of their favorite female stars and hiding their crushes on the male stars , buying the movie magazinesto read about " the love affairs of the stars . " Margot perceived , with a good deal more irony and less pleasure than she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was what Ada doubtless had learned to call " glamorous " from the movie magazines . But it did give her a slight revenge for Vanchie 's flustered ability to hold to her disapproval and stay unmoved by the fascination Margot used to exert . Margot felt almost warm toward Ada  --  as warm as she could feel toward anyone , when her heart was so dry . She felt the irony of being appreciatedat just the value she had wanted to give herself . " Why do we stand out here ? " she said with vague cordiality . But Ada would n't go into the living room . She answeredp462with awe , " Oh , no , I do n't want to make you late for the picnic . " Evidently Ada regarded the Rotary picnic as too lofty a social event to aspire to . It made Margot think of the old days when Ada would stand waiting in mute , awkward adoration , after school , until she saw whether Margot was going off with " the girls " among whom Ada was too humble ever to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ada , " Mrs. Ferguson said now . " Yes , " Margot repeated somewhat vaguely . She pitied Ada as much as she could anyone when she herself was so sore . But did mother actually think she could be excited by a call from Ada Rist ? Well , she would show the folks this afternoon . She would do that much . Bun was out in front now with the car , honking loudly . Dad , as usual , was afraid they would n't be on time , and mother was afraid they would forget the baskets . It seemed to Margot she had known all this from the beginning of time . She went out and got into the car beside Bun . " You the driver ? " " Yeah , if I can get dad into the back seat . I can make half an hour better time than dad and he wo n't know it . It 's a trick . " Bun grinned . " You want to drive ? " he generously offered . Margot shook her head . The words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She felt the pain of being in any car but their own roadster , hers and Bruce 's , driving through the sunshinetoward the blue mountains . What if she should startle the folks by telling them that a man had bought a car for her ! But they would n't believe her , probably . They still thought of Carl and Dorothy as " popular " and Margaret as " unpopular . " Bunny , however , as they got out of the car at the picnic grounds , showed a certain pride . Margot felt that mother was rather uneasy about her looks , about what people would think . Maybe she was a little too exotically " smart . " Bun took her arm and led her forward , and Margot could feel that , even if she was his sister , he was half shyly pleased to appear with her before a crowd . It helped her vanity greatly and made her P463feel suddenly a sort of barren gaiety that would prove capable of anything she chose to do . Oh Lord , but how familiar was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy trees . What would the old crowd say if they knew she was attending a Rotarian picnic ?  --  and looking forward to it with some excitement ? Margot felt her old impatience at the familiarity of the middlewestern atmosphere , the dark green leaves , the concentration upon food , the fat men already licking their chops , and the matrons stooping broad-beamed over the well-filled baskets . The Rotary Anns were entertaining the Rotary boys . But at least Margot was pleased that the foks had got this much more secular . They were worldly , in fact , compared to what they used to be ! Yet she had an outraged disbelief . How could she be here ? For a moment she struggled with it as if it were a nightmare . She seemed to see , beyond these heavy oak trees , the sunny peace of the pueblo on a cloudless day . There was the first slight embarrassment of facing the group . But she saw instantly that she was the best-dressed woman there , the most striking . It gave her a rather pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was saying nervously , with a little laugh , not quite knowing whether she dared to be proud of this daughter , " Of course you know Margaret ! " There was some consolation in seeing the surprised , interested eyes , the calculating glances of the women , no doubt wondering " what she had done to herself . " Most of them had n't known her well , thank God . Dad had become a Rotarian since her day in Belmond . It showed how the folks ' prestige had increased that the club had made a pretext of dad 's handling of estates to bring him in as well as Richard , two from the same bank . But Ethel Spencer greeted Margot with effusion , taking both her hands . " Why , Margaret Ferguson ! I 've been hearing about you from Grimmie . She 's wild about you . Is n't she a dear old thing ? " Ethel 's bright eyes had taken her all in and approved . Margothad a subtle feeling of being accepted as a confederate in the great business of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill you if you attempt one . There 's no heart interest . None at all . But he used to be the prettiest boy in our room at school . " " Is that a fact ? " Richard asked with vague geniality . Then he put several sandwiches on her plate , telling her that she was his partner 's daughter , and he must look after her . Gardner Allen ! That fat slob ! Margot knew that it had lain stealthily in her mind all day , hardening her and making it possible for her to stand things enough to go to the picnic  --  the thought of carrying off Gardner Allen before the eyes of Mildred . That was the reason for the mysterious eye-shadow , and the yellow silk stockings , and the yellow hat . But when she looked at him now , it seemed too much of a punishment . Yes , he had turned into a sloppy small town slob , with receding hair and rimless glasses , and a deflated , bewildered look . Mildred , of course , was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gardner was n't doing so well with the store . Evidently he was not accepted among the elite of the Rotarians . But all the same , she bet it was because Mildred was too much for him ! There was Mildred herself . And she was just a youngish small town matron . She , who had long been to Margot a symbolfor a type of femininity , spurring Margot on to greater efforts ! Nevertheless , Margot saw from her eyes , from a certain uneasiness and animation in her glances , that she was still capable of cutting up and was far from resigned to being no longer very pretty . She did n't like it very well , having to sit beside poor Gardner . He was quite out of the hilarity of the " gay table . " Margot was confused between feeling sorry for him and still feeling jealously that it was his own fault . Mildred was sore because they had been placed where they were ! If she watched , Margot thought , she could no doubt see with whom Mildred was having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgive and even approve that in Ethel Spencer . But not in MildredSummers ! Mildred was up to her old tricks ! Margot thought she hated these women most of all who played both sides . But again it was not interesting enough to seem worth while to put herself to the trouble of watching . Dinner was good , of course . You could count on food at P467home , if nothing else . All were loud in their praises of the Rotary Anns . Margot was excited , after all , by Ethel 's subtle implication that they two were banded together to have a little feminine delight apart from the housewifely herd . It was pleasing to have Richard 's attentions , even while she discounted them . He was jaunty as of old , when she had stared after him , highly impressed , as he went down the street swinging the only walking stick in town . And she had always liked him , in spite of what she knew was the folks ' unspoken disapproval , because he had said that she would " work havoc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working it ! When they got up , Ethel again thrust her hand through Margot'sarm and drew her away . " Tell me about Grimmie , " she begged . They went off toward the creek . Ethel said ingenuously , " I love to wander in the woods , do n't you ? " Margot was amused at the dreamy look of absence with which she contemplatedthe other women getthig to work at the tables . But Margot defiantly approved of it . She felt a savage hostility toward the housewives , and imagined that they were all regardingher with stern condemnation . As a matter of fact little Mrs. Cummings was saying wistfully that she wished she could wear yellow ; and Mrs. Ferguson was flushed with praises from Mrs. Viele and Mrs. Hoagland in regard to Margaret 's improved appearance . " I always thought Dorothy was a lovely little thing . But I did n't know you had two such beautiful daughters ! Somehow , I did n't seem to know Margaret so well . " But the men soon drifted near , as always when Ethel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tighteningthe reins on Richard in a subtle manner . Her effusiveness toward Margot had not decreased , but now it was imbued with a certain defensive alertness . No , Ethel never gave herself away , either ! She never really got in wrong . When four of them went strolling beside the creek , it turned out to be Ethel and Richard and Margot and Dr. Redmond . And then Ethel thought of something that she wanted in the car and Margot and Dr. Redmond were left together . To be regarded in Belmondas a dangerous woman ! She supposed it was a triumph .
