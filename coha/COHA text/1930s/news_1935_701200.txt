txt A sharp clash of ideas over banking legislation developed today when Marriner S. Eccles , governor of the Federal Reserve Board , faced Senator Glass at a hearing before the Glass subcommittee on a banking reform bill very similar to that passed in the House yesterday by a vote of 271 to 110 . Mr. Eccles asserted that no central bank existed today which was not controlled by the government of the country in question , but Mr. Glass sharply retorted he had been told that instead of Prime Minister telling the Bank of England what to do , it was the Bank that gave the instructions . The divergence of thought . between the two men relates particularly to Title II of the new legislation , which seeks to expand the powers of the Federal Reserve Board in a manner which Mr. Glass thoroughly dislikes . In one of the exchanges , Mr. Eccles assured Mr. Glass that he did not favor Father Coughlin 's " central bank " proposal because , the reserve governor explained , " it was not a practical arrangement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the House in striking out a provision of the administration bill forcing all banks which are members of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to fain the Federal Reserve System by July , 1937 . Mr. Eccles said he wished this restored , but with a modification that all banks with deposits of $500,000 and upward must join the system within a year of entering the deposit insurance plan . This , he argued , would bring about as rapidly as possible a unification of the banking system and also relieve small banks from joining the Reserve . Reiterating views expressed before the House Banking Committee in pleading for passage of the omnibus bill , Mr. Eccles denied that the measure would " increase the powers of a political administration " over the Reserve board . He asserted that , on the other hand , the bill really " contains provisions intended to increase the dignity and independence " of the board . Although Senato . Fletcher , chairman of the Banking Committee , wishes to hurry the bill through Mr. Glass 's subcommittee , thence into the full committee and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearings would be held . His subcommittee is now considering the bill introduced in the Senate instead of the measure passed by the House . Mr. Eccles 's statement that there was no central bank not under control of its government was interrupted by Santor Glass , who said : " On the contrary , I heard a man in New York who is thoroughly familiar with the British system say that the Premier of England would not dare tell the Bank of England what to do , but rather the Bank of England tells the Premier what to do . " Mr. Eccles retorted : " There is a very responsive cooperative relationship between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Bank of England . " To substantiate this statement , he read from a declaration by Viscount Snowden , former Chancellor of the Exchequer , that no important step was ever taken without consultation between the Bank of England and the government . " Are you in favor of a government central bank ? " asked Senator Glass . " No , not in the sense of transfer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply . " Do you favor Father Coughlin 's central bank proposal ? " " No , " Mr. Eccles answered rather sharply . " Well , why not ? " Coughlin Plan " Not Practical . " " Well , it is not a practical arrangement , " said Mr. Eccles . " Ownership is not a. vital matter . It makes no difference whether the government or the banks own the stock . It seems to me that those charged with management are more important than who owns the stock . " " If it is a central bank , it ought to be a bank and have proprietary interest , " Senator Glass answered . Senator Couzens entered the discussion , asking : " Assuming your bill had been in force in 1928-29 , what procedure would you have taken ? " The Reserve governor said he could not answer this " rather broad question . " Mr. Couzens insisted , however , that the question " seems important to me . " Then Mr. Eccles said : " I think the Banking Act of 1933 would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over speculation , margins and collateral loans  --  it seems to deal directly with the situation . " " Then most of those abuses have been remedied by the Banking Act of 1933 , " Senator Couzens commented ironically . " In so far as speculation goes , the 1933 act takes care of it , " Mr. Eccles said . Ile wished to continue with his prepared statement , but Senator Glass asked for a reply to Mr. Couzens 's question . " The efforts of the two former Secretaries of the Treasury ( Mr. Glass and Senator , who also joined in the questioning ) seem to me to estop an answer to my question , " Senator Couzens put in , but Mr. Glass said he was only trying to elicit the answer . Senator Townsend suggested that Mr. Couzens was entitled to a reply . Finally , Mr. Eccles said the bill did not propose any new activity along the line of controlling speculation . " It places responsibility for three features of monetary control in the Federal Reserve Board , " he stated . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiation of which is in the hands of an open market committee . " Then there is the rediscount rate control in the hands of the board . Then there are the Reserve requirements , control over which is given to the President in the Emergency Banking Act . Responsibility on the Board . ' " The bill proposes to recognize the three functions and place responsibility for their exercise in the Federal Reserve Board . The board is charged with the responsibility that is taken under any of these functions . " The statutes of all the newer central banks of the world recognized the " necessary relationship " between the government and the central bank , Mr. Eccles asserted in his statement , continuing : " That it is not clearly recognized in the charters of some of the older central banks is due primarily to the fact that the relationship between central banking , commercial banking and the money supply has been a gradual development and the responsibility of public control over deposit banking has only been gradually appreciated . " There is in the world today no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ownership or the legal provisions of its charter , which is not subject to control by government . " Quoting Woodrow Wilson as demanding public and not private control of the banking system , Mr. Eccles said the need for public control " of the function of supplying the medium of exchange to the people of the United States , both by issuing currency and by regulating the volume of bank deposits , seems to me to be almost a noncontroversial matter . " Discussing his suggestion to assure " as rapid a unification of the banking system " as possible , Mr. Eccles said : " I am informed that there are 5,644 State non-member banks belonging to the insurance corporation whose deposits are $500,000 and under , and 2,038 whose deposits are over $500,000 , so that , roughly , three-fourths of the insured nonmember banks would not be obliged to join the Federal Reserve System if my suggestions were adopted , and only one-fourth , representing the larger banks , would be required to join , " he stated . " This would not deprive the small banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time it would not seriously interfere with the system 's monetary policies , because the banks with deposits of over $500,000 which would have to join the system hold 77 per cent of the total deposits of all insured non-member banks . "
