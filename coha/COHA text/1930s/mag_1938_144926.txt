In Spa Marienbad last week , the age owner of the Hotel Weimar created Czechoslovak stir by opening the " Royal Suite , " last occupied in 1909 by British King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra when they came to " take the waters . " Down from its wall came a portrait of bewhiskered Kaiser Franz Josef and up went a photograph of smooth-face Fhrer Henlein . The new occupant of the Suite was Sudeten Nazi Leader Konrad Henlein who went there to confer with representative of Britain 's mediator , Viscount Runciman . <P> It was soon evident that the political pot was boiling . After a two-hour conference Lord Runciman 's chief aide , Mr. Frank Trelawny Arthur Ashton-Gwatkin flew to London to confer with Foreign Secretary Viscount Halifax . He was sa : to have reported : 1 ) that Fhrer Henlin was virtually a " straw man , " repeatedly refusing to commit himself and saying he must first consult Berlin ; 2 ) that unless Britain again issued a firm warning to Germany , Lord Runciman might not be able to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buzzed with a story that German Field Marshall Hermann Wilhelm Gring had just told foreign diplomat : " I have definite information that in case the German Army marches into Czechoslovakia the British will not lift a finger !

On top of this , Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain sent Sir John Simon , Chancellor of the Exchequer , to make a speech at Lanark , Scotland . There he strongly reaffirmed Neville Chamberlain 's own declaration of last March that Britain might find herself drawn into any war breaking out in Eastern Europe . " The beginning of a conflict is like the beginning of a fire in a high wind , " said Sir John , weighing England 's words but not mincing them . " It may be limited at the start , but who can say how far it would spread or how much destruction it would do or how many may be called to beat it out ? . . .
