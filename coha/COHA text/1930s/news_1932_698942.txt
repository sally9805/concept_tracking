txt The British Government spent today trying to correct the impression that the new Anglo-French entente represented a " united front " on the question of war debts . A beginning was made by communicating with Paris in an effort to reconcile the opposing British and French interpretations of the agreement as it touches the war debts to the United States . The British were half anxious and half annoyed over the statement Premier Herriot was reported to have made to the finance and foreign affairs commissions of the Chamber of Deputies last night , asserting the two nations would act together in the coming debt negotiations . Two Denials Are Issued . The government then proceeded to issue two denials , both directed across the Atlantic . The first was announced at 10 Downing Street , where Prime Minister is resting before going to Scotland Saturday , and declared emphatically that the AngloFrench accord did not establish a " united front " on debts . The statement follows : In connection with reports which have been put into circulation as to the intention of the AngloFrench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adhere , there is no truth in any statement that it is applicable to the question of the British debts due to the United States of America . The use in the declaration of the words " European regime " expressly excludes from its purview any question affecting non-European countries . A second denial , issued by the Treasury , was a further attempt to clear up the speech of Neville Chamberlain , Chancellor of the Exchequer , In the House of Commons Monday , in which he referred to conversations with representatives of the United States . This statement follows : He did not suggest and of course had no intention of suggesting that representatives of the United States had approved , either tacitly or explicitly , of what was done at Lausanne . The proceedings there were throughout on the basis that the right course was to seek a European solution of reparations without involving the United States in the discussion . The government today issued the text of the Lausanne " gentlemen 's agreement " as a white paper , together with other relevant documents aris- ing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although it does not mention the United States by name . It provides that Germany 's four creditors  --  Britain , France , Italy and Belgium  --  will not ratify the Lau ' sanne agreement until " a satisfactory settlement has been reached between them and their own creditors . " The only mystery about the document is why it should have been kept so mysterious . The London Times says " it is a pity the British Government should ever have consented to make any secret of this agreement ; it managed to surround with an air of furtiveness a perfectly natural , honest precaution . " If a satisfactory war-debt settlement is not obtainable , the declaration asserts , a new situation will have arisen and the legal position will revert to what it was before the Hoov'br moratorium . The White Paper includes a joint letter to Chancellor von Papen , informing the German Government of the arrangement , and the Chancellor 's reply .

Britain Regrets Debts Position . Following these documents comes a hitherto unpublished letter from the Chancellor of the Exchequer to the French and Italian Finance Ministers suspending payment of their countries ' debts to Britain until after ratification of the Lausanne agreement . The letter expresses regret that Britain could not do more for her debtors . " His Majesty 's Government of the United Kingdom would have been very glad , " Mr. Chamberlain wrote , " if it had been possible for it to cancel the war debts of France and Italy as part of an all-around cancellation of war debts and reparations . In the actual circumstances it ? regrets it can not enter any definite commitments modifying the existing war debt funding agreement . " The last of the six documents is the declaration by Sir John Simon , Foreign Secretary , at Lausanne last Saturday suspending the payment of all war debts due Britain until after ratification of the Lausanne accord .               @ @ @ @ @ @
