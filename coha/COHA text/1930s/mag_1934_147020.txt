His Excellency the Earl of Bessborough , Governor General of Canada was in bed last week with a severe chill . But Canada was as hot as the Earl was cool . From Quebec to British Columbia angry little groups talked of his behavior while newspapers demanded a public apology . <P> Fortnight ago on Empire Day the city of Toronto celebrated its 100th anniversary with parades , speeches and banquets . As Governor General , Lord Bessborough had accepted an invitation , but , more important to native sons . Toronto 's best known daughter , Mary Pickford , had come home for the centenary , stealing all the applause . <P> The Governor General and his lady arrived in their private car , were escorted to the City Hall . At the front door they waited . Mayor Stewart and the city fathers expected them at the side entrance for a private reception in the Mayor 's office . Minutes passed before word of the mixup reached Mayor Stewart who rushed down to find the representative of the Crown red as a beet under his plumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the parade to begin . Stammering apologies Mayor Stewart asked his Lordship if he would care to come back for the reception . <P> " NO ! " bellowed Lord Bessborough . " Where is your Mary Pickford ? Get on with your Mary Pickford show ! Whers is the parade ? Get on with the parade ! And I want to know , my man , what you will say if I report to the King that I have not been properly received in Toronto ? " <P> " That is for you to say , sir , " said Mayor Stewart . <P> After the parade Lord Bessborough refused to sign the distinguished visitors ' book at Toronto 's Old Fort , departed in a huff . <P> With few exceptions the Canadian Press attacked Lord Bessborough last week . They pointed- out that to earn his keep a governor general has only to attend the functions to which he is invited and keep his temper . Only critic of Lord Bessborough to surfer was a radio announcer known as Uncle Al , who launched into an impassioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour : <P> " Our Mary Pickford is flesh of our flesh and of good red blood , not blue . Torontonians can not tolerate an affront to her , particularly when it comes from an alien to the land of the Maple . " <P> Uncle Al was suspended and Lord Bessborough caught his chill . <P> To the ill-concealed rage of King George ( TIME , Dec. 15 , 1930 ) , Australia was the first Dominion to demand and get a native governor general hand-picked by the Dominion . The Irish Free State followed when the arrant Republican Donal Buckley was given the job in 1932 . Canada may be the next . Last week the Winnipeg Free Press pointed out : <P> " A native governor general could be reprimanded , castigated or scolded-did events seem to call for it-with no sense of impropriety or bad manners . He might even register as much impatience as Lord Bessborough did , without a national crisis being the result . . . . Lord Bessborough may well have made history both for himself and Canada by his little flare-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
