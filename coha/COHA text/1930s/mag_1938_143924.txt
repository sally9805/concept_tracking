Last week , in his annual report to the Harvard Board of Overseers , Harvard 's President James Bryant Conant waved warning flags : <P> " It seems evident that we are in danger of reaching the condition already so acute on the continent of Europe , where the problem of unemployment in the learned professions demands attention . . . . It seems to me highly probable that a diminution in the total number of students in the universities of this country is desirable . " <P> " I think few . . . can doubt that the learned professions suffer because they have failed to recruit from all economic levels of society . " <P> President Conant proposed to extend Harvard 's national scholarships , now financing 67 undergraduates from 15 States , to all parts of the U. S. and to the university 's graduate schools . He also announced Harvard Law School beginning next fall would admit only those candidates " who appear to the committee in charge to have at least an even chance of passing the examinations . . . .
