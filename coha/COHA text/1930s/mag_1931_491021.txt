acquired , overexaet manner , wit h sonic odd disasters to the free meaning of words . You wonder at this . For thirty years the Americans have been implanting the English language here ; all that time it has been the language of primary education in the free public schools . These reporters , therefore , must have got it in their childhood . Why do they use it as a foreign tongue ? And why do they treat you as a visiting foreigner ? As they speak of American things they say " you " and " your " ; of Filipino things they say " we " and " our . " To the hotel is a short drive along the bay front , and you see nothing of the city . You do see on your left a group of insular automobile agencies , very spaciously housed , and above them the familiar devices of American motorcar heraldry . This friendly sight and then immediately at the hotel a collision with hearty Rotarians may temporarily efface your pier impressions , or , if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in self-government under American sovereignty must in itself be regarded as an American achievement , When it comes time to go calling on the Governor-General to pay your respects , you are feeling more at home . By the ordinary sense of time it is ten minutes from the hotel to the executive palace ; in the eventful sense of time it is an excursion through two thousand years . On the face of this life is the writing of man 's passion , or it may be a compulsion he does not himself underlstand , to impose upon others the articles , manners and superstitions of his own civilization . The ancient means employed to this end were piracy , conquest and trade . Long before the world was round , the incomprehensible Malay overran the Philippines in waves , displacing both better and worse . His eivilization was tribal , disunited , in every apparent way weak , and yet somewhere in it was the power to survive the ceaseless impact of stronger people from the mainland of Asia  --  even that of the Chinese , who were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than his own put its mark on the Malay 's life , touching his dress , his tools , his weapons , his way in the environment , and changed his nature not at all . When the Spaniards found him it was impossible to say which of his cultural possessions , if any , belonged purely to his heritage and which had been borrowed from others and adapted . His civilization at that time was evidently regressive . He was surrounded by works , notably the great rice terraces in stone , which he could not imaginably reproduce . He had lost even the tools . Physically , too , he had deteriorated for reasons not clear ; at least as to many tribes of him this was true ; particularly those who inhabited the lowlands where the minimum wants of life are too easily satisfied . Probably he had mixed his blood with that of too many other races . Racially he was no longer pure Malay  --  not more than half  --  and yet the essential Malay nature persisted . The Spaniards ruled him for three hundred years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise very much as they found him . Then the Americans . What the Philippines represented when the Americans came was the weakest cultural salient in the East , the Malay salient . What the Americans represented was Western machine power in its highest phase . Besides the event and philosophy of machine power , they brought ideas of sanitation , horizontal education and democracy . Except you muse it historically the city of Manila will be an illegible scene . It is a document on which nothing has ever been quite erased . Writing overlays writing . The American overlay now is large and bold . There is no reason to suppose it will be the last , and it reads yet to no conclusion . The product of free education , by the American idea , is a very visible , self-conscious student body . Young Filipinos in the Western man 's whites and patent-leather shoes ; Filipino girls after the high-heel styles current in Hollywood movies , made thereby superior to the Filipino girl or woman going still in the native footgear , which is a wooden sole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clapping on the pavement with a musical , xylophonic sound . What will become of this student body ? Will it transform the native life ? Or will the native life absorb it ? You see it against a background of things belonging to the time now , to a time remote and to a time before Christ , all acting together in one tapestry . Western Machines and Eastern Man Power T HIS now is machine time . Yet you must see that the Western machine is not so easily victorious . Its wheels slip and labor for traction in the sands of Eastern man power . Here are machines and men performing identical tasks of suicidal drudgery and at the same money cost . The daily burden of the city is moved under three signs of power  --  namely , gas , grunt and sweat . The first is the motortruck . The second is the earabao cart . The last is the human carrier in a rhythmic dancelike step under his balancing shoulder stick . For those who ride in haste or state there is the motor ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rickshaw  --  the Malay man will not pull a rickshaw  --  but by the earromata , a giddy sunbonnet on two wheels pulled by an over-harnessed dwarf horse no bigger than the Malay in the flying shirt who goads it . All this in one stream of traffic directed by Filipino cops turning stop and go signals and forbidding left turns . On one bank of the Pasig River is a new post-office building in the best modern style ; the river is cluttered with Asiatic barges propelled by barelegged men and women . Within a mile of the legislative building you may see // you may hear at the palace  --  certainly not to a Filipino . Well , then , you feel it again  --  the same singularity  --  with an American you find in one of the executive departments . You ask him broadly some question touching the nature of Filipino government , and he answers it lightly . But when two or three Filipinos around him are gone and the door is closed , his manner changes and he says , " Now I 'll tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask at the American Chamber of Commerce for certain documents touching the laws that govern business in the Philippines . They will he sent around to you . After several days you ask again . The documents are there waiting for you , and the reason they have not been sent around is that a free statement of opinion got into the letter of transmittal ; therefore , it was deemed unwise to send it out . They were going to rewrite the letter with that part of it deleted ; however , now that you are here again , you are welcome to read the letter , and then it will be destroyed . A few repetitions of this experience , varied only by the circumstances , will set you to observing Americans . They may well become for a time your first study . The official group is very small . Below the Governor-General and the vice governor there is but one American executive left in the whole insular government . He runs the Bureau of Forestry , with an all-Filipino personnel . In all the Philippines there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Generally , they are in business . You meet a little oil mill in which nearly naked men are expressing oil by wedging the ground nut meal through a hollow log ; and a gasoline engine is turning their grinder in place of a carabao that died to make way for progress . You may hear native music , ballads of the ancient life , proceeding from American loud-speakers and American disk records . You will see American electric-light wires running to bamboo huts . As for this , why not ? These nipa-thatched bamboo dwellings , so frail , separately so impermanent , are as the bamboo itself , or the grass or the palm trees . Collectively , continually renewing , were they not less perishable than the houses and walls raised in stone by the Spaniards ? Spanish sovereignty happened and unhappened . A bamboo civilization survived . And now you are on your way to say " How do you do , Excellency ? " to a man from Missouri who sits in an old Spanish palace and represents American sovereignty , which has endured for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An Interview With the Goverrzor , General AT THE door of the palace Filipinos receive you . Filipinos take down IA your name and business . Filipinos ask you to be seated . They have all a way of seeming strange with you and very observing , which makes you to be strange with them and unobserving . The Asiatic eye , besides that it is impenetrable , can not be embarrassed . A Filipino conducts you to the Governor-General . Passing through the executive offices you note that the entire personnel is Filipino . The first American face you see is that of the Governor-General 's aide in the antechamber . He takes you to the Governor-General . You do say " Excellency " to a man from Missouri . Then the door shuts behind you and the form is forgotten . Hours later you will still be trying to say what it was that gave the interview its singular character . Not that it was in the least unsuccessful . It was very agreeable and the talk was free . Yet there was a certain air of constraint about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be repeated ? Yes and no . More as if it might be overheard . And you recall that not alone with the Governor-General but with also the American members of his staff who appeared in his outer office , there was a common trick among them to look around before speaking  --  that is , if the words were to be of any conviction  --  and always a drop in the pitch of the voice . If it were not absurd you would say the representatives of American sovereignty in the Philippines behave as if they were afraid of the Asiatic ear . This notion seems to make so little sense at first that you put it away . Nevertheless , without quite knowing why , you make a note never to repeat anything them at the Chamber of Commerce , in the clubs . in their homes , at the Manila Hotel , which is the free social center ; and that mark of inhibition is on all of them alike . It is as if one great area of fact and opinion were always guarded . You may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there with no offense whatever , but the coin you get in exchange is small and often rings false . The more freely you talk the more you will feel distrusted  --  not in any way you can mind or resent , but strangely , as if you were among friends without belonging to their lodge . And besides this undefined attitude toward you , there is evident among them a constant external anxiety , which causes them to look before they speak . Yet , except only in this one area , anywhere this side of the line that demarks it , the American tongue is itself and reckless . The most interesting group is that of the thirty-year men . These are they who came with the army of occupation  --  most of them as soldiers , some on the parallel civil errand . First was the insurrectionary Malay to be pacified and disarmed ; then to be made sanitary in spite of himself , vaccinated , educated , and lastly persuaded to the ways of government in the Western principle . For a glimpse of the first American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Filipino , writing his personal recollections : In 1000 my family abandoned its hiding place in a far-distant barrio where it sought refuge from the onslaught of the American forces in their triumphant march throughout my home province , Batangas , and accepted voluntarily American domination . The new conquerors had been pictured to us of unusual size , with peculiar and alarming features and little regard for human life . They had their headquarters very near the home to which we returned . My younger brother and I frequently peeped through the glass to catch a glimpse of our dangerous neighbors . As there was nothing abnormal in their features , except that they were bigger , whiter and physically better built than our own people and as we saw that they were kind to children and dogs passing by their quarters , we decided one Sunday morning  --  my younger brother and myself  --  to brave it , and with a handful of bananas we approached a group of three American soldiers . They treated us very kindly and gave us a dime each . One of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One month after we had returned to our home my mother opened up a store in our own house and made a handsome little business with our soldier friends , who spent their money freely buying eggs , chickens , cigars . cigarettes , fruits and soft drinks . On Sunday they played baseball , and my brother and I would watch the game and sell them soft drinks , and besides paying our price , which was 100 per cent higher than usual , they tipped us liberally . Six months after the American soldiers entered my home town a small school was established by them , and I was among the first boys to attend that school . The Thirty  --  Year Men Thirty-year men are those who stayed to raise the Filipino . When the military job was done they went over to the civil side as executives , organizers , founders , teachers . Much of the American achievement is actually their work ; there is very little of it with which they have not somehow assisted ; all of it they have witnessed . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders with whom they fought in the swamps and jungles when they were all so arduous . As the government , which at first was all American , became more and more Filipino they gradually retired . During the regime of Governor Harrison , whose passion was to rid the government of Americans , many of them were expelled from public service to make room for natives . Now you find them on their own , in sugar , hemp , coconuts , industry and trade . You would hardly take these men to he afraid of anything  --  Filipino , Malay or earthbound . So only the more strange . At a dinner with eight or ten of them in private surroundings , you will have the typical experience . Here again the guarded area of speech , a sense of distrust touching the outsider and that anxiety in the field of hearing . It may occur to you suddenly that an American in the Philippines is very seldom out of Malay hearing . Almost never . If you had not already remarked that on one subject the American tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find yourself a little dazed at the way the thirty-year men handle the American Government at Washington . For these occasions they keep it in the form of a stuffed effigy . Their pastime then , after dinner , is to eviscerate it , let out the sawdust , and trample it ; no two for the same reasons . Though the reasons of one may contradict the reasons of another , it is all the same and their jubilation is equal . At the end of it they agree in only one possible way . Things That are Not Said All the conditions are preposterous . Better much worse than as they are . Who gathers up the sawdust and restores the effigy for the next occasion ? The Filipino servant . After such a dinner it happens that one of them will accost you to say as follows : " I 'm sorry somebody did n't open up last night . You were not interested in anything we could say about the American Government at Washington . You know more about that than we do . But there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very low-down on what you are after here . I was hoping they would . " " Why did n't they ? " " You 've been here long enough to know the answer to that question . We are afraid . That 's all . " " Afraid of me ? " " No , not afraid of you . " " Afraid of something I might . write ? " " Hell , no . We do n't care what you write , so long as you do n't quote us by name . " " Well , then , what are you all afraid of ? Americans afraid in the Philippines ! It 's incredible . " " That 's exactly what General Wood said when he was Governor-General . We were in a jam here with some of our private things  --  no matter what  --  and I was one of u , committee that wont to ask him for help . We had a perfect legal and moral right to ask . It was a ease in which American authority ought to have been exorcised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I 've got more trouble now than t van manage . Why ca n't you work yourselves out of this situation ? Why bring it up to me ? You know what to do . Go ahead and do it .. ' I said , ' General , we are afraid . ' He said , ' I do n't believe it . Americans like you , afraid ! You who laid this place down with your own hands . I do n't believe it . ' I knew the general very well . I said to him , ' Governor , the I ruth is these people have got us buffaloed. ' e are afraid . And I 'll tell you som else : Before you are through here they will have you buffaloed . ' " A pause . " They did buffalo him too . I was sorry afterward I said it . He reminded me of it later when he was at an impasse here . Washington upheld him , that 's true . He was vindicated in every way . We all knew he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Malay won . " " It 's the Malay , then ? " " Yes , it 's the Malay . The longer you study him the less you know him . I 've been here thirty years and I do n't know him . It 's the Malay . It 's the Filipino Government . It 's the fact that the American 0 overnment iseitherpowerless or unwilling to protect Americans . You ask the Governor-General how far he can protect an American who , from a point . of principle or for any reason not a wrong one , gets himself on the wrong side of the Filipinos . Do you know what . he will say ? If he is downright he will say that although he may he able to protect him in a specific instance , still , he can not keep them from taking it . out . of his hide in a hundred and one other ways . Then , of course , there is the kind of situation iii which no power ran help . I was saying , about that dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . One man there 1 was sure would not . He did it once , among friends , all Americans ; yet the things he said somehow got out .. The Filipinos took them badly , and what it cost him in his business I 'd halt ' to tell you . " The Importance of Good Will So there it is . In the Philippines  --  one place on earth  --  the American is afraid to speak his mind out loud even under the sign of American sovereignty . The American official has two reasons for minding his speech . One is a reason of tact . The Filipino , being Malay , is extremely sensitive . He is nursed with a sense of inferiority , and although he may have a mind so cultivated as to be able to admit it , still , that does not alter the fact . Even more , perhaps , than other Asiatics , he has in all instances a face to save . One who has not lived in the East can have no understanding of what face means . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life than his face . Suicide is often the last way to save it . Of all the Asiatic faces , ( ho Malay is the one most fragile . A word bluntly spoken may be a disaster to the amenities . The second reason is that official Filipino-American relations have come to rest wholly upon Filipino good will . Least of anyone is the American Governor-General independent of it . If he lose it his administration will be ruined . The American Governor-General does not govern the Philippines . The all-Filipino legislature passes the laws ; the American Governor-General administers the laws through executive departments , all of which are Filipino in personnel and all but one of which is Filipino at the head . So long as the Governor-General is in the good will of the all-Filipino legislature there is coOperation ; if he falls under its displeasure there is no cooperation ; no coOperation , no government . Given these facts and given also the nature of the Malay , with his extremely injurahle face , all the rest is clear . The slightest saying from an American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bomb in the Filipino press . One overt saying from the palace , direct , overheard or repeated , may wreck a Governor-General 's administration and end his career there . The Filipino has a pure appetite for this kind of situation . The Malay mentality is perfectly suited to exploit it . The American mentality is stultified by it . The power is all on one side , and it is the power to exercise an all-pervading moral terrorism . No opportunity to prove it is neglected , and each time it is proved it is stronger . The recent Roosevelt instance was convincing . The President of the United States appointed Nicholas Roosevelt to he vice governor . The Governor-General and the vice governor are the only two representatives of American sovereignty who may be legally appointed without the consent of Filipinos . Actually , the ease is that they , too , must be possessed beforehand of the Filipinos ' good will . And that is what the Filipinos proved . Mr. Roosevelt had written a book on the Philippines in which the Filipino found something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonfire of Filipino indignation  --  specious because Mr. Roosevelt himself was not the main point . Probably not fifty Filipinos in a population of thirteen million had ever read his hook , seen it or heard of it . Apparently there was some difficulty about finding a copy of it in Manila for the ceremony of public burning . Moreover , every intelligent Filipino knows how impossible it is for a vice governor to act injuriously in Filipino affairs . He can not act upon them at all but by suggestion and counsel and with the consent of the Filipino legislature . Simply , it was a grand occasion for the exercise of the moral terror . And it worked . Mr. Roosevelt did not go to the Philippines . The effects were altogether bad . Here authority acquires no merit by grace alone . It is the Malay nature of the Filipino to be contemptuous of Americans just in proportion as his power increases to snake them walk softly and fear their own tongues . Not long ago the American principal of a provincial school untactfully refused to permit his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another bonfire . The student body threatened to go on strike . In the Filipino press appeared a propaganda for expunging the last of the American teachers from the Filipino school system . Later a Filipino official of that province , on receiving some American visitors , speaks not of the incident itself but of how tactfully it was handled by the provincial Filipino authorities so that nothing really disagreeable came of it .. He tells this with an astonishing inflection . You are to understand that he and his associates have in a very considerate manner saved your American face . This strange American . Having brought to the Filipino his sausages , his A B C 's , his tools , a standard of living two or three times higher than that now existing in any neighboring Asiatic country , and then a ready-made government as a political gift , where does he stand ? He is a foreigner under his own flag . He is an alien on his own pub-lic domain . In his annual report for 1028 , Governor-General Stin-son tells how meticulous he was never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to participate in it beforehand , and says : " In that way many an im-portant executive policy which inev-itably would have been resented by Filipino public opinion , had it been deemed to be the sole act of an alien executive , was accepted or welcomed as coming also from their own leaders . " .17 Self  --  Governing Malay State An American ) . Governor-General to be deemed an alien executive on American territory ! The American in the Philippines  --  this sentimental imperialist  --  is not the least of the riddles of the East . His sovereignty is an oblique thing , both real and unreal . His responsibility in it is unlimited ; therefore , it is real . But lie has no more rights in it than a foreigner . Therefore , it is unreal . For more than thirty years he has been building here a self-governing Malay state in the Anglo-Saxon pattern , with a most vague idea of why or what he should do with it if he succeeded . There was no economic or political necessity for a self-governing Malay state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever existed in the world . Nor was there any moral obligation . When the American raised his flag in the Philippines his title to them was absolute and clear . The whole archipelago was American territory , ceded to him by Spain ; the only reason for not treating it as incorporated territory , like Alaska , Texas or California , and giving the inhabitants collective citizenship , was that the inhabitants were Asiatic ; and Asiatics , we think , are not desirable to be assimilated . So , first , was the saying to them that under American sovereignty the Philippines would be governed and developed with the happiness and well-being of the Filipino people steadily in mind . Then from much paternalistic feeling and thinking came a second saying , which was : " The Philippines for the Filipino . " As Americans we can not imagine Happiness and well-being for people not even for Asiaties  --  without the institution of popular self-government . We were hound to press that , blessing toward them , and we did . The " Philippines for t Filipino ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first no distinct political meaning . It was Taft who crystallized it as a guide rule of American conduct . What naturally happened was that it translated itself into a doctrine of prior Filipino rights and ultimate Filipino possession . Thus the rise of a Malay state , with independence in view and its own sovereignty to be imagined , was inevitable  --  not in the nature of things but in the nature of the American . No irrevocable statement . of policy on the part of the American Government . was necessary . There never has been , in fact , anything that could be called a formulation of American policy in the Philippines . Nevertheless , in default of a policy , and almost unawares , a Malay state has been created . It exists partly in fact and partly in illusion , and possesses already certain attributes of sovereignty . Its people are protected by the American Government and travel on American passports ; yet they owe it no obligation whatever  --  not even the obligation to bear arms in its defense ; they pay no taxes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor American citizens . They are citizens of the Philippines . Before the American Government sends a Governor-General or a vice governor it inquires to know if he will be acceptable to the Filipino government , as if he were an ambassador to a sovereign country . Powers of the Native Legislature The all-native Filipino legislature is the supreme lawmaking body in the Philippines . The sovereign American right to enact laws in American territory has been surrendered to it . The American Congress , it is true , could abolish the Filipino legislature and the whole Filipino government , but that now is unimaginable . When it surrendered the lawmaking power it reserved to itself the right . to annul any law enacted by the Filipino legislature ; it reserved also to the American Governor-General the right to veto a Filipino law . Neither the American Congress nor the American Governor-General can pass a law , and the power to annul or to veto is but the one-sided power to say no . The Filipino legislature also may say no.Thut is , it may in its pleasure refuse to function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it once did . What results in practice is that the Governor-General is reduced to resources of suggestion , persuasion and barter . Nominally he is the supreme executive power to administer the laws . In fact , the Filipino legislature controls also the administration of its laws , from the fact that the heads of the various executive departments appointed by the Governor-General are subject to the appkval of the Filipino Senate . Thus the executive power , too , has been practically surrendered . The heads of all executive depart- meats , with one exception , are Filipino . The bench is Filipino , up to the Supreme Court , where five Americans survive against four Filipinos ; the chief justice is Filipino , The attorney-general is Filipino . The prosecuting attorneys are all Filipino . The organized provincial and municipal governments are entire Filipino . In the whole government of the Philippine Islands fewer than two officials in each one hundred are American , Two Filipino commissioners , paid by the United States Government , sit in the American Congress at Washington . No American sits in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anglo-Saxon pattern may very well be the marvel of the world as a monument to what . Americans will take for granted  --  namely , here , that . what is good for them will he good for any people , and that with a few years of standard American education a group of Malayan races , pagans , Mohammedans and Christians , with more than eighty tongues among them and a tribal civilization behind them , can be made equal to the most difficult form of government that was ever invented , The Philippine Jones Law Whatever the Filipinos have done with their American education , they have learned to make the sound of an injured people . What this Malay state complains of is humiliation . its pride is hurt by the fact that its world status is indefinite . It wants complete independence  --  that is to say , sovereignty . But . the status of the American Government in the Philippines is indefinite and humiliating . It has no rights that the Filipino government feels obliged to respect , not even the right to a naval base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spaniards . At a recent hearing in Washington on a bill to grant independence to the Filipinos , with a stipulation beforehand as to an American naval base in the islands , one Filipino view was that all such matters should remain to be settled by treaty between two sovereign nations . The steps , the blunders , the effects of personal policy in lieu of a national policy  --  the history , that is , of how the American Government advanced to this political deformity in the Philippines  --  belongs to a narrative of connected fact . Herein only what is visible , matter of statement . and illustration . So far as the American Congress is concerned , the culminating act was the Jones Law , which is now the organic . law of the Philippines . The preamble to this law says it is the sense of the nation to grant independence to the Philippines as soon as stability of government there shall have become a fact . It is doubtful if the American Congress can legally hind the nation to anything in a preamble . That point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It sets up a Filipino government and then ties the American Government 's hands by surrendering to the all-Filipino legislature the lawmaking power in the Philippines . American Governor-Generals have variably construed the . Jones Law  --  one by the preamble and another by the text ; one to mean we were getting out . and another to mean we were not  --  and in the confusion the Filipino  --  no blame to him  --  has steadily and shrewdly increased his power both within the law and outside of it . For example , the American Government at . this moment is unable to carry an act of simple justice to the Moro tribes . The Moron are the fierce Mohammedans of the south . They were never conquered . The Spaniards tried and failed . The Christian Filipino 's blood runs cold when he thinks of Moron . They surrendered to the Americans thirty years ago and gave up their arms under the explicit understanding that we should never deliver them to be governed by the Christianized Filipinos . The Moron are one million ; the Christianized Filipinos are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not fear ten Luzon Filipinos , ten Tagalogs , ten of any other tribe in the islands ; but we were asking him to give up his arms , and this he did on condition that what he was accepting was American rule forever . The Moro is Malay , too , and called Filipino . There is nothing else to call him , because he was found native there . Yet he has almost nothing else in common with other natives and has for centuries held himself superior to the Christianized Filipinos whom he terrorized , especially the Tagalogs , who now are politically supreme and control the Filipino government . The Moro is not interested in this Filipino government . He takes no part in it . He is interested only in his tribal affairs , in his land and in his religion , which still moves him once a year to go on a pilgrimage to Mecca . Well , now , what he feared has come to pass . For the American rule which he accepted has been gradually substituted Filipino rule , until at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the all-Filipino legislature at Manila . That would be bad enough . But . now he is losing his land . The Filipinos who govern him are slipping it away under his feet in a strictly legal manner . He does not understand the land laws at Manila . He can not understand why the land that has been his since the beginning of tribal memory suddenly is not his until he has hired a Filipino engineer to survey it and draw a picture of it and has filed that picture at the land office in Manila and has received , after maybe four or five years , a certificate of ownership . Least of all can he understand the sense or justice of this  --  that a shrewd Tagalog who does understand the land laws and who knows the new ways of Manila may come and look at his land , and then , if he covet it , may bring somebody to survey it and make a picture of it , take that picture away to Manila , and presently return with a deed which says the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it always . Yet this happens . ? Moreover , it happens as a rule that the Filipino who takes the Moro 's land does not want to work it himself . When he has got legal possession of it he leases it out to Japanese farmers for a division of the profit and himself retires to Manila . The Land Problem in Davao In Davao , on Mindanao Island , where the soil is fine for hemp , such legal seizure of Moro land by Filipinos for hire to the Japanese has been going on for several years , and now a serious political problem is latent there . Chinese immigration into the Philippines is restricted ; Japanese immigration is not . And although the Japanese can not buy land , nevertheless , they are eolonizing Davao on Moro land leased from Filipinos who seize it legally from the Mores . From time to time the Moro breaks restraint and fatally removes two or three industrious Japanese hemp farmers . That changes nothing . The Japanese Government is silent ; the stoical Japanese farmers submit to the toll . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second largest island in the archipelago ; in a potential agricultural sense it may be the very richest . The port of Davao is an open port , important both economically and in the strategic meaning . Japanese colonization there may or may not be politically significant . Anyhow , the American Government dislikes it in principle , for this is , after all , American territory . Much more it dislikes what is happening to the Moro , as concerning his hereditary land , for that is outrageously unjust . But having tied its hands when it surrendered the lawmaking power to an all-Filipino legislature , the American Government now finds itself unable to act . It is true that any new land law passed by the Filipino legislature must be approved by the American Government ; but , on the other hand , the American Government can not itself enact a laud law at all . That function belongs to the Filipino legislature . The American Government could abolish the Filipino legislature . The American Congress could repeal the Jones Law . In theory , it could . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereignty by implication of force , with no overt provocation from the Filipino government to justify it , there is no likelihood in it . Year aft er year the Governor-General pleads with the Filipino legislature to change the land laws for what we would think was the general good of the Philippines , but the Filipino legislature steadily refuses to do it . In thinking how justice may be done to the Moro , Governor-General Davis , who went personally to examine the situation , has hit upon the idea of great reservations of land that shall remain intact as it is in the tribal use and possession of people whose prior claim to it is morally indisputable . But he will have to put it through the Filipino legislature , if he can do it at all , by his gift of persuasion . He has no other power . The Desire for Independence What the Americans there mean who say the present position of American sovereignty is a mortification does gradually appear . A situation that can not endure as it is will of itself tend naturally to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanding absolute independence  --  that is to say , sovereignty  --  because the thought of it has been held out to their pride , and demanding it immediately because they want it now , and with a great many Americans at home for both sentimental and selfish reasons saying " Give it to them , " the situation is growing worse . It has now reached a point at which , to say the least , the first terms are clarified . The American Government must either cede away the last of its sovereignty and be done with it , or find some working alternative that will he acceptable to the Filipino government . This is simply to say , beyond argument , that it must either get out or negotiate terms with an artificial Malay state of its own making . " And it is my conclusion , " says one who represents the form of American sovereignty there , " that the sooner we see this and make terms with them the better bargain we shall be able to arrive at . " What he means is that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Filipino nationalism advances . Nothing else could happen . No one on the ground can be long insensible of the facts . The emotional , unreflecting clamor for absolute independence is rising . With it , and perhaps more deeply inspiring it than anyone suspects , rises also a morbid , resentful feeling of racial self-consciousness . That wind is blowing in all Asia . In the Philippines it has certain eccentricities of direction and effect . To begin with , even in his own world , the Malay has a sense of racial inferiority . Other Asiatics put it on him through centuries of conquest and overbearing . The Filipino , therefore , is under a special necessity , when he can , to assert his self-esteem , by a law of psychic compensation . When he can not assert it , or if the assertion of it fails , one of two things will happen to hint . Either he will sink to a. state of self-oblivion , as historically he did , or he will smolder with pain and meditate revenge . And this necessity in his nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears both pathetic and absurd . Treated as Equals That the keenest edge of his new racial vanity should set itself against Americans seems at first thought quite natural . They represent his tutelage ; their presence is a constant reminder of the low estate in which he recently lived . But the Spaniards represented tyranny , and this feeling we are speaking of seems really to have risen much less against them . It is probable that the Filipino 's pride was less injured by a thousand acts of Spanish oppression than by the fact that as a Filipino he is barred from one of the desirable American clubs of Manila . The Spaniard 's superiority was a basic assumption , always implicit in his behavior . In that case the inferior race suffers one shock to its pride , which is thereafter numb , and there is no journal of minor injuries . Subsequent relations have the merit to be free of make-believe . Then came the Americans with their sayings about equality , their faith in education to level people up , their ideal of democracy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people you must take pains to flatter their self-esteem and treat them as if they were equal . But as every American in his heart does know his superiority , and as every Filipino does feel his inferiority , all suavities to the contrary are in a sense false . The inevitable facts of behavior break down the fiction , and this slip of the mask again and again , in sudden , unexpected ways , is very hurtful to the Filipino 's pride . Almost one would think it were better if the thing he has to face were undisguised . All contacts now are embarrassed by the rising sensibilities of the Filipino . Everyone feels it , everyone knows that the difficulties are increasing , and yet the subject by its very nature is taboo . The glimpses are often painful . For example , at a dinner of journalists and publishers , purposely arranged to prove the amenities between Filipinos and Americans in the presence of a visitor , the editor of an important Filipino newspaper is making a speech on the theme of understanding . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of loving him , and how well Filipinos and Americans get to know one another from daily contact . Pointing to one American at the table , he says : " We have known each other for fifteen years . " There is a pause . His color changes . It is evident that something has suddenly occurred to trouble his thoughts . When he speaks again , his voice is altered . " We have known each other for fifteen years , " he says once more . " I like to think we are friends . All that time I have been seeing him every day , But he does not know my wife . " The last seven words are uttered with intense feeling . What he is saying is that an American who treats him as an equal in the daytime does , nevertheless , reject him socially in the evening . Then he recovers his poise , goes to the end of his speech , and everybody pretends to forget one more slip of the mask . At a formal dinner , under the auspices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Filipinos together , then three Americans , then three Filipinos and two Americans , and so on , around the table of thirty or forty places . The Filipinos are rigid . They speak in low tones to one another , seldom to an American right or left : the initiative must come from the American . When it does , the Filipino responds politely , very correctly , and immediately drops hack into his well of reserve . In what goes lightly hack and forth across the table he takes no part . This may be mentioned afterward to a cosmopolitan Filipino who was once a newspaper reporter on Park Row . " That only shows , " he answers , " what new eyes may see . I did not notice it . Yet now that you speak of it , I know it was so . It is always so . We take it for granted and no longer see it as you have . Nobody is to blame . It simply can not he helped. - Three Types of Filipino As Governor-General of the Philippines , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement in his annual report-1928 : " It has been frequently asserted that opposition to American administration in the Philippines is an almost wholly artificial result of selfish agitation by comparatively few native leaders . The result of my year 's experience has been to make me feel that such assertions are much exaggerated and to recognize that there is a racial sensitiveness between the brown and the white races in the islands which is inevitable and enters into almost every problem of administration , and which can be handled only by the exercise of the utmost consideration on the part . of those Americans who are vested with executive responsibility . In the absence of such consideration , this racial sensitiveness of the Malay may easily be provoked into fanatical outbursts . " Naturally , the governing Filipino  --  that is to say , the native leader  --  exploits this official American anxiety , and he does it with deep Malay ingenuity . The Filipino must . not be provoked . There is a caste of native leaders . They are derived almost entirely from three tribal groups  --  namely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Tagalog is the dominant element . In the whole archipelago there are more than forty ethnic groups  --  Christian , Mohammedan , pagan and aboriginal  --  and among them more than eighty tongues and seven distinct languages , the definition of a language being a written tongue in which one hundred printed books or pamphlets have appeared . In this human conglomerate the Tagalog group is politically all-powerful , not because it is qualified by superiorities of mind or character but for the reasons , first , that it surrounds Manila , which for centuries has been the seat of power , and secondly , that it contains the highest admixture of Spanish and Chinese blood . The true governing caste is the mestizo . This is a word to designate a Filipino who is part Malay and part Chinese , part Malay and part Spanish , part Malay and part any other blood . In the Filipino Government at Manila . it would be very difficult , perhaps impossible , to find what may be called a pure Filipino . It is , in fact , a government of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you might expect , is hot-minded , brilliant , imaginative , rhetorical , uncreative . The Chinese mestizo is less visionary , shrewd , subtle , persistent , also uncreative . These two mestizos are the Filipinos we know best . In themselves they are no more characteristic of the whole Filipino people than the dog eaters in the northern Luzon hills who , now that it is forbidden to eat dogs , bootleg that delicacy . Nevertheless , in a practical sense , they do represent this Malay state . They are the government. , with a skill for political craft coming in some instances to the point of genius . On one hand , they exploit the ignorant , unpolitical , lazy Malay , knowing him as we can never hope to know him , and how to move his mind by images and elocution . On the other hand , knowing Americans with a shrewdness so dissembled that we continually undervalue it. , they exploit every weakness of the American position , every sentiment in the American character . The Economic Motive They can make the Malay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a predatory capitalist pursuing his own economic ends with intent . ultimately to possess the Malay 's land . They can hold the representatives of American sovereignty in constant fear of provoking by word or deed a fanatical outburst of racial feeling . When they appear before a committee of Congress at Washington to plead for independence , they know exactly the words and historical allusions that produce romantic reactions in the American mind ; they can make a roomful of United States senators feel ashamed to speak of economic : things , as if they were weighing the noble values of justice , liberty and the divine right of people to govern themselves , against sugar and vegetable oils and the American market for canned goods in the Philippines . Their ( lair for propaganda is astonishing . There is no propaganda in the field of unromantic facts . It is well , therefore , to set forth a few of these facts . The American economic motive in the Philippines is unimportant to begin with and , in any case , unprofitable . The United States Treasury receives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes them for nothing . But on Philippine products sold in the United States it waives import duties amounting to forty to fifty millions a year , and this sum is , in fact , a subsidy to Philippine industry . For example , free sugar from the Philippines does not affect the price to the American consumer , and this is so because it is a fragment of the total quantity imported . That is to say , if the quantity received from the Philippines came instead from Cuba and paid the import duty , the price of sugar would be the same as it is to the consumer , but the American Treasury would he richer by , say , thirty million dollars annually . On imports of Philippine tobacco the United States collects internal revenue and sends the money directly back to the Filipino treasury . Unparalleled Advantages There is , of course , a free market in the Philippines for American products . What of that ? Well , this of that : Our exports to - the Philippines constitute only one-fiftieth of our total exports ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent of their value , then that profit is entirely absorbed by the cost to the United States of the Army , the Navy and other free services in the Philippines , amounting to fifteen millions a year . From American expenditures in the Philippines and from the free entry of Philippine products to the American market  --  many of these in direct competition with American products  --  the Filipino is enabled to enjoy a standard of living far above the common Asiatic standard , and one he could not hope to sustain for himself . If he did not sell his sugar here , he could not sell it at all in competition with the sugar of Java and Cuba , because his ways are inefficient and his costs for that reason are high . As a citizen of the Philippines , he has more personal liberty than an American citizen in the United States . Instance , the prohibition law does not touch him . He enjoys without cost the unlimited protection of the American Army and Navy and the benefit . of American diplomatic service all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government . His legislature has more power and more independence than any lawmaking body in the United States , the Congress only excepted . As for the land , the Filipino has more to say about that part of the American public domain that lies in the Philippines than a citizen of Montana has to say about that part of it which lies in the state of Montana . Thus our Malay state , of as much of it . as can be made visible and patent in one crude outline . For all things a history . That will be another outline , And then , whether or not there is in every chaos a principle of solution , there is here , nevertheless , an urgent question : What are we going to do with it ?
