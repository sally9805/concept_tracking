txt The Senate Finance Committee today broadened the base of the House Tax Bill to carry into effect President Roosevelt 's wealth-sharing program and turned it into a device for raising $450,000,000 annually in new revenue from all classes of citizens from relief workers to the richest in the land . The estimate for the House bill was $250 , - 000,000 . The Senate committee 's revision , practically completed today , of the House schedules was so vastly different in principle from the recommendations in the President 's message of Tune 19 that predictions were virtually unanimous that it would never become law . The expectation wasthat the Senate committee 's draft would be rewritten again , either on the Senate floor , where it will be taken up Tuesday or Wednesday , or in conference , to which Senate leaders hope to commit it by next week-end . The committee voted to reduce personal exemptions in the present Income Tax Law from $2,500 for married persons to $2,000 , and from $1 ; 000 for single persons to $800 . Surtax Brackets Widened . Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent on incomes in excess of $3,000 instead of $4,000 , as at present , and to carry proportionate increases throughout the surtax structure , reaching a maximum of 75 per cent on income in excess of $5,000,000 . It did not disturb the existing normal tax rate of 4 per cent . In an 11-to-8 division the committee repudiated entirely the principle of the inheritance tax , chief recommendation in the President 's message , but it voted to so increase the present estate and gift taxes as to produce exactly the revenue estimated for the House inheritance levy The Senate committee accepted the principle of the corporation excess profits tax as adopted by the House , although not recommended by the President , but adjusted the rates so as slightly to reduce the impost carried in the House draft . The Senate group voted also to increase the present capital stock tax ; from $1 to $1.50 per $1,000 , and to allow corporations to redeclare the adjusted fair value of their stock for computation of this and the excess profits tax . In only one major feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was the section imposing a slightly graduated tax on corporations . The House rates of 134 per cent on corporation net income of less than $15,000 and 14% per cent on income in excess of $15,000 were agreed to . Inheritance Tax Not Dead . Democratic Senate leaders held considerable hope tonight of being able to restore the inheritance imposts when the bill reaches the floor . This provision was-deleted when the committee fell under control- of its ultra conservative members . The administration forces had less hope of deleting the provisions for general revision of the surtax schedule and for reducing the personal exemptions to the income tax , because of the conservative-liberal combination which wrote this into the bill today . The regulars had been informed , however , that the House would never stand for imposing new taxes in the lower brackets and - would hold out against such changes to the end . The committee roll-call on rejec- tion of an inheritance tax clause It was as follows : For striking out  --  King , George , Walsh , Gore , Bailey , Byrd , Lon-ergan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans-11 . Against striking out  --  Harrison , ' Barkley , Connally , Costigan , Black and Guffey . Democrats ; La Follette , Progressive , and , Capper , Republican-8 . The new surtax rates and lowering of personal exemptions are counted on to produce $220,000,000 of the estimated $450,000,000 yield I from the bill . That most of this is expected from the lower brackets is demonstrated by the fact that the House surtax rates , beginning the increase at $50,1100 , were calculated to yield only $45,000 ; 000 . The movement in the Senate committee for higher surtaxes in the ; lower as well as higher brackets I was led by Senator La Follette . That they were accepted was at- ; tributed , in no small part , to the I fact that Secretary Morgenthau , in his appearance before the commit-tee declined to state definitely whether the administration wanted ' the Tax X Bill confined to the outline suggested by the President in his message , and to the additional fact that the House had dared to go outside of Mr. Roosevelt 's implied 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The vote in committee for the La Follette rates in the lower brackets was not recorded but was said to have been overwhelmingly for them . Democratic Senators who usually follow administration wishes voted with the Wisconsin Senator , being uninformed as to whether the President would accept the proposal . " We simply turned the bill into a revenue measure , " Chairman Harrison said in explaining that he voted for the La Follette rates himself . " If the administration does not want these rates , then it can say so . Otherwise , we need the revenue which they will provide . " Senator Harrison made no secret of his disappointment at the committee 's action in striking out the inheritance tax provisions and stated that he would vote to restore them . " I do n't think the bill as now revised carries out President Roosevelt 's suggestion , but I think it is a gesture in that direction , " he said . " The bill does carry some graduation on corporation taxes . but not to the extent the President suggested . It does reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it does not meet the President 's recommendations as to inheritance taxes . The committee has gone further than I believe the President intended for us to go in adding taxes in the lower brackets . " I would prefer to write a bill carrying out the President 's suggestion in letter and in spirit . " But inasmuch as we decided not to conform to those suggestions , I felt we 'd better go and get some revenue . I think the bill as a whole is a good revenue producer . " Mr. Harrison said that if he and other administration followers were successful on the floor in restoring the inheritance tax , he would offer a group of amendments designed to modify the administrative provisions adopted by the House . One of these would grant a longer time , probably a maximum of fifteen years , in which inheritance levies might be paid by the beneficiaries , and another ' would reduce the interest rate so that the interest on deferred payments for both the estate and inheritance tax would not exceed 6 per cent per annum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he explained , would be accomplished by the Senate 's voting down the committee 's amendment for deleting it and for imposing higher estate levies . The . finance committee is to meet again Monday at 2 P. M. when a draft of the bill as revised by the committee will be ready . Mr. Harrison hopes to report the measure formally Monday or Tuesday and to take It up for floor action on the following day . The bill will still be open for amendments at th committee meeting Monday , but Mr. Harrison had little expectation that it would be changed further . In the last few minutes of the session , the committee approved a group of minor amendments . One presented by Senator reduces the interest rate on delinquent tax payments from 12 per cent to 6 per cent a year ; another by Senator Gore exempts from the gasoline tax fuel sold for use by States , counties or political subdivisions thereof , and another by Senator Harrison repeals the penalty license provision of the Internal Revenue Liquor laws as they apply to dry States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the processing tax on imported cocoanut oil and copra was also adopted .
