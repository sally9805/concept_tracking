CRIME <P> A man in a messenger 's uniform taxied along Ogden Avenue in the Chicago suburbs one afternoon last week , came to a halt at Smith 's Barbecue near La Grange . Two men in a Ford sedan drove alongside the taxi . <P> " Have you got a package for Smith ? " asked one . <P> " Here it is , " said the man in messenger 's uniform . He handed over a small bundle . <P> The sedan started up with a jerk , shot down Wolf Road . The taxi driver and his passenger leaped from their cab , began dancing up &; down in the road , waving their arms at an army airplane overhead . The airplane picked up their signal , nosedived . Instantly along Wolf Road , down which the sedan was racing , squad after squad of armed policemen appeared from ambush . A barricade was flung across the road , cutting off the sedan 's escape . The airplane was swooping down , into machine gun range . The sedan shot into a side road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coming head-on toward it was the taxi . The sedan driver headed straight for the cab , swerved clear just as the cab 's occupants were leveling their machine gun . Brr-rrr-ack ! went a volley . Careening into a wooded lane , the sedan bounced crazily over bumps and ruts , crashed into an elm . The two men leaped out , ran in opposite directions . One peeled off his hat &; coat , dropped them . By the time their pursuers reached the spot , both had escaped . Few hours later a farmer explained that for $10 he had unwittingly driven one of them to a trolley in nearby Maywood . The fugitive had pleaded that his wife had almost caught him in the woods with another woman , that he wanted to get home first to " save our kiddies from a broken home . " <P> Thus unsuccessfully ended the elaborate attempt of Chicago and Federal police to trap John ( " Jake the Barber " ) Factor 's kidnappers who had audaciously demanded a payment of $50,000 in addition to the $50,000 they collected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone wires in Factor 's apartment the officers had learned of the second extortion demand , persuaded the frightened Factor to let them lay an elaborate ambush . All they got for their pains was the hat &; coat and the damaged sedan , the license of which was listed under the name of a man connected with Chicago 's " Terrible Touhy " gang . Newsmen discovered that 300 policemen had been organized for the trapping , but that unfortunately their sealed orders failed to state what it was all about . While the policemen gaped , the kidnappers got a flying start . <P> Whether , in return , the gangsters got any real money was uncertain . Federal agents declared it was all bogus , but reports were current that the package contained at least $500 in bills wrapped around a stack of note paper .
