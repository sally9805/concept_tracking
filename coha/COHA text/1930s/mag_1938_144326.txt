One day last week the Association of American Railroads announced that Class 1 railroads had an operating deficit in February for the first time in 17 years- $2,136,481 , against a net operating income of ' $38,792,779 in February 1937 and $58,367,529 in February 1930 . Two days later Franklin Roosevelt told a press conference at Warm Springs , Ga . that the special railroad report of ICCommissioners Splawn , Eastman &; Mahaffie , given to him fortnight ago , would not be made public until after he had conferred in Washington this week with a group of operating railroaders . Then , said the President , definite recommendations would be sent to Congress in a special message . <P> When the railroaders got together with the President this week for their last say in the matter , they brought a plan cooked up by chunky George Harrison of the Railway Labor Executives Association . Labor 's George Harrison suggested that the Government grant the railroads an outright subsidy sufficient to bring their revenues to the normal $800,000,000 a year . This might mean a Government outlay of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RFC . John Jeremiah Pelley of the Association of American Railroads nodded in approval . So did his committee of presidents : Frederick Ely Williamson of the New York Central , Ernest Eden Norris of the Southern , Samuel Thomas Bledsoe of the Atchison , Topeka &; Santa Fe . <P> It was further suggested that the money from RFC , if it be regarded as a loan , be regarded as an unsecured loan . Few U. S. railroads have anything left to borrow on . The subsidy would put men to work not only on the roads , but in the heavy industries from which the railroads normally buy so heavily . <P> How Franklin Roosevelt replied to this proposal was not disclosed , but grapevine rumor reported him as dubious of its practicality . He was also reported to have asked that no wages be cut by the roads . When George Harrison and fellows emerged from the White House after two hours all he would say was : " We presented the joint views of railroad labor and management . . . . The next move is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road ready to totter at any moment , it seemed unlikely that Franklin Roosevelt would delay more than a few days .
