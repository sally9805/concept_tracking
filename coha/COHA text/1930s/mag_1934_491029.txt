I N THIS horseless age there are still some 17,000,000 horses and mules in this country , but the last horse trader is being stuffed for a museum . The horse has n't changed , nor the man , but the times have . I sing of the road trader , in whom horse trading reached its apogee . Road trading was a vast , unorganized commerce grounded in the peculiar economics that often made a poor horse more valuable  --  to the trader  --  than a sound one . Most anyone could swap horses , but the road trader was an artist . The touch of the master was to trade and then to get back the twenty-dollar snide to use again and again . A snide was a good-looking horse with a hole in him  --  that is , one with one or more major disabilities . Worthless as an animal , he was invaluable as a pawn , his loss a blow to the owner . Men made a side-line business of supplying snides to traders , a topsy-turvy traffic in which the buyer made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A balker would be hitched and every trick exhausted to make it . pull . A bull-windy must be demonstrated to be a collapser , not now and then , but always . Some horses got the idea and would drop at the tug of a halter . Hitting the Horse Trail T HE range of the road trader was the Missouri Valley . It is no disrespect to New England and New York State to say that here were men who would have turned David Harum over to their herd boys for practice . There were horse dealers and horse swappers everywhere , even good traders in a minor-league way , but the man who made a route from St. Joseph to the Canadian line and back each year could be said to have had the benefits of travel . The Missouri Valley road trader began his season toward the first of May , when there was grass for the animals and reasonable warmth in the air . Then , for forty years or so before the Model T , there was a stir in the covered-wagon camps from Yankton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentration in the river towns , Hardy Wright remembers counting forty-three top wagons in Crow 's Pasture as he set out from Cone-oil Bluffs in the spring of 1892 . Wagon boxes that had been banked with earth in or adjoining feed lots were lifted back onto running gears . To the hardier families who had lived all winter in the wagon as it stood , departure was as simple as hitching the team and calling in the dogs . Some rented houses , but few put on airs because of it ; next year they might he out . in the feed lot with the others . The man went . ahead in a spring buggy . After him toiled the jolting top wagon , driven by wife or older child . There followed five to twenty snides , some led , the others kept moving by a boy on a pony . As to the trader 's code , there are two schools of opinion , both agreeing that the first law was to get something to hoot . One holds that he was ruled by expediency and cave-al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be honest with honest men . It was pretty generally understood , though , that there were no honest men when trading horses . As a rule , if a trader said his horse was sound and had no had habits , it . was the truth , but were you sure that lie said it , or did you just get the impression that . he had said it ? Ed Hilliker was the most celebrated of Western traders , His word was good . The man who said , " Ed , pick me out a team , " was dealing with the Bank of England , but most of Hilliker 's customers approached him with something to be got rid of . Then it was a horse trade . Ed had a bleeder mule worth his weight , if not in gold , at least in silver . The mule was hauled from camp to camp in a wagon , but once in camp , would be hitched with a horse . As every horse swapper sought matched teams , Hilliker 's misfits were the signal for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hilliker did n't mind what sort of snide he got in exchange for his mule , knowing that the mule would never get more than 100 yards away ; that was as far as the bleeder could travel under his own steam . Hilliker had another jewel , a big sorrel that could n't he led to water or anywhere else . But where the trader 's wagon led , the sorrel would follow without halter or tie rope , on the understanding that it was of his own free will . This self-respect was much admired by other traders to whom Ed would let the sorrel out on a percentage basis . One season his share was $200 . Hilliker was six feet , two and a half inches tall and weighed 285 pounds . He could hold a wild horse . When his first automobile failed to stop at his " Whoa ! Whoa ! " he pulled off the steering wheel . He broke the critter . On one hand in his later days he wore a four and a half carat diamond , on the other a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He paid fifty dollars for his Stetson hats , and as an eater was celebrated ; his children say every day was Thanksgiving . He would drive through Kentucky and Missouri for home-cured hams and believed that he found the best on the worst roads . Once , in a dining ear , the check for his youngest child was four dollars . During the war , he and his partners sold 75,000 horses and mules to the armies . He spent and gave away a fortune . The Odyssey of a Trader AT TWELVE he ran away m fro home at Red Oak , Iowa , after trading ponies with a preacher 's son . His father , a blacksmith , ordered him to trade back . " No , " he said . " It was a trade . " He joined Hi Miller , then the greatest trader of all . At sixteen , he had his own wagon and four horses . Another lad was the cook and a reader of dime novels . One evening near Hamburg , Iowa , a sow rooted past the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire . Hilliker , infuriated , killed the sow with a neck yoke . The owner of the hog had both boys arrested and it cost them the outfit to get out of jail . They walked out of town in different directions . In an Atlantic , Iowa , hotel , Hilliker , then about nineteen , overheard a man speak offensively to a girl employed in the restaurant  --  a girl Hilliker never had seen before . He dragged the man outside , gave him a beating and returned to his wagon . The next spring he married the girl  --  sixteen-year-old Catherine Tally  --  and they went honeymooning in the covered wagon . The town thought it was n't much of a match for her . For twenty years she went along , drove a wagon , bore children in camp , and when Hilliker quit the road , broke , he founded a fortune on 8500 she secretly had saved . Once Hilliker reached Council Bluffs with neither money nor food . Leaving his family in camp , he took a horse around to the barns to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He tried all day and failed . When he returned to camp , supper was on and flour , bacon and other supplies on hand . " Kate , where did this come from ? " he asked . " Do you miss anything around here ? " she countered . " No , nothing except the dog . " " That 's it , " she said . She had made her own swap . Hilliker was diplomatic and would talk a long time to stay out of a fight , except in defense of a friend . So far as is known , he gave ground only once . In Oregon , about 1907 , he had a dispute with a group of ten ranchers over his refusal to accept certain horses . Just as he believed the party was about to jump him , a big Irishman stepped over to his side and said they would have to take him too . When the others withdrew a little way to parley , the Irishman got Hilliker a horse . without saddle , and told him where to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horse and the advice . " But they never could have made him take horses he had n't bought , " testifies his old partner . " They would have had to kill him . " Justice Tempered With Horse Sense AS A YOUTH he earned the admiration of the St. /A Paul traders . An iceman had a beautiful team of runaways . He would n't deal with a trader . Hilliker learned where the man fed them . He took the top from his wagon and drove over , leading a pair of big , windy colts . He had his wind-broken team feeding from the back of the wagon when the iceman came alongside . " Where you from ? " the man asked . " Kansas . Grasshoppered out . " " Want to sell them colts ? " " No . " " Trade ? " " No . " The iceman was persistent . He talked Hilliker into taking the runaways and $100 for the colts . Ed sold the team for $400 . He was slow to advise , or interfere in another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man 's own making . Otto Schlueter , now a road contractor , once took him on a horse-buying trip . Schlueter was driving a pair of wild trotters . They were worse than broncos , because they were larger and could last longer . Stopping at a. farmhouse , Schlueter left Hilliker holding the lines . When he got back to the road , no one was in sight .. Soon Ililliker drove up . Schlueter asked what was wrong . " Here 's your lines , " Hilliker growled . Schlueter tactfully said no more . It was obvious that the team had run away and that Hilliker had taken them four miles around the section line . Then the team ran again . " Ed , help me hold ' em ! " Schlueter called . " Hold your own blank-blanked team ! " Hilliker returned , in even tones . After two or three miles . one horse turned out for a bridge and the party landed in a heap . Hilliker got out , stepping over Schlueter , who was n't hurt , and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked if there were horses for sale . The farmer 's wife saw no rig and asked how he had got there . " I came with Mr. Schlueter . " " Where is he ? " " Layin ' out there under a buggy on I lie bridge . " His chief diversion was poker . At Grand Island , Nebraska , an important war-horse-inspection point , there was a game that ran for eleven days . with large sums on the table most of the time . Ik played every night , sometimes all night , but by day he attended to business . As Hilliker prospered he built a barn a block long and an eight-room house across the street in Fremont , Nebraska . There was company all the time , but no servants . Mrs. Hilliker and her three daughters were equal to all domestic situations . Every tramp was fed , and visitors had to stay for dinner or all night . At a time when his firm was making $1000 a day on war-horse contracts , a real-estate agent suggested that a man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , " he replied . " I would n't have a house where I could n't smell the barn . " His last deal was on a single span of mules , two weeks before he died in 1924 . A farmer appeared at the house and told what he wanted . " Chris , " said Hilliker. " my days are about gone . I do n't feel like any more business . But there 's a team over at the barn I think would suit you . Cost you $400 . " The man paid the money and went for his sight-unseen team . A few days later , Hilliker was taken to the hospital in Omaha . forty miles away . " Drive by the barn , " he asked . He looked long , said nothing . About an hour before he died , Bud Smith , a former associate , called , took his hand and turned away . " Turn around here , partner , " said Ililliker . " I know you 're crying . I 'm glad you are . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other way . " Smith turned and found him smiling . Traders were not in court as often as might be inferred . First. , the losing swapper was n't eager to advertise his defeat ; second , the winner was skilled in talking his way out . Then , too , the horse sense of the justices of the peace was not always Blackstone . A barn trader was summoned before a Nebraska justice on complaint of a dealer who said he had paid $175 for a balky team . " Did you tell this man the team would pull ? " asked the bench . " No , Your Honor . " " What did you tell him ? " " I said , ' You 'll he surprised to see them work . ' " The justice was seized with an attack of coughing and hid his face behind a law book . Presently he emerged and addressed the complaining party : " How long have you been trading horses ? " " Since I was seven , Your Honor . " The J. P. reflected upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The judgment of this court is that you better trade with somebody else . " The Horse That Did n't Care VES , the trader was a handy explainer . There was 1 the old one about the farmer who complained : " One horse of that team I got from you is blind . " " No , he ai n't really blind , " the trader said . " He 's blind as a bat , " the farmer insisted . " He runs into things . He runs into the fence . He runs into the barn . " " Well , he ai n't blind , " was the soft answer . " He just does n't care . " This , presumably , was the original of Ed Wynn 's celebrated horse that just did n't give a damn . Byron Clark , Burlington general solicitor , once appeared in a suit which was tried on the issue of whether balkiness in a horse is physical or mental . His client was a Plattsmoulh , Nebraska , liveryman who testified that the other man had told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a dollar . " The liveryman figured that he need n't bother about the mental state of the animal . The veterinarians called as experts were about evenly divided , but the jury concluded that balking was at least partially a physical state , and found for the liveryman . Charley Mitchell , later to become wealthy with Hilliker in the horse-commission trade , tells of his kidney-dropper mare . The mare had a quick turnover . Shown in harness , she seemed all right , yet the instant she was unhitched , she would lie down and roll . Thereafter she would raise herself on her front legs and sit . Mitchell , a huge man , could lift her the rest of the way by the tail , an advantage not owned by others . His customers sold back or traded back without haggling . The last thing they needed was a sitting horse . The trader was a good actor . His wife and children were part of the seta ting . Not only did they lend verity to the idea that these were homesteaders on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plea not to sell Ginger , her own property , or Nellie , the children 's pride and joy , was disarming . Ed Miller had been a road trader out of Louisville , Nebraska , For years when he was taken in by this comedy . " One of my team was a dummy , " he tells , " making the other horse and me plenty of trouble . He would n't lead , he would n't pull . I passed another trader with a nice-looking young mare . I said would he trade . He said he might . The mare had an ankle bandage where he said a ring-bone had been cut out , but she did n't seem to be lame any , and I thought . if sbe could pull her half of that top wagon , there could n't be anything wrong with her that I could n't fix . But something told me to watch out , and I began backing away . That 's when the old lady speaks up : ' Pa , you ai n't goin ' to trade off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' I thinks now maybe the mare 's all right , so I trade . I 'm not fifty yards down the road before she goes lame . The fellow had her hitched up and just standing there waiting for a sucker like rite . I have to give her away . " Bud Smith , a big commission dealer , used to buy and sell around York , Nebraska , in his youth . When a strange trader invaded what Smith felt was his private pasture , Bud set out to rebuke his impertinence . Obtaining a fitty , Smith drove slowly for two hours up and down a road the interloper was accustomed to travel . They met , traded and drove away in opposite directions . " He 's traveling a pretty good clip , " Smith observed to himself , with satisfaction . " Looks like the mare will get warm and cut loose before he gets home . " He was right , but the trouble was that Smith 's new horse got warm , too , and just about wrecked the buggy . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill Dunn , trader and auctioneer of Weeping Water , Nebraska. , recalls the chastening of a buyer he employed who paid sixty dollars for a beautiful gray at a farm eighteen miles out . The animal was a kidney dropper and it took two days to get her home . Dunn put her into a sale , " at the end of the halter " ? meaning , as is . She brought thirty-five dollars and someone gave two and a half dollars for the bargain . The second man turned her back to Dunn for a yearling colt , decided he did n't want the colt and traded for two dozen chickens . Among gypsy traders , the wives and children were direct producere , selling fur coats and laces and telling.fortunes . With such a backlog , the men were not driven by necessity into close bargains . The regulars thought there was no sporting blood in a gypsy ; he demanded a sure thing . The trader had plenty of time . He hurried no deals , had no quotas , no pep talks . So far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No congressman wept over his sad case . He got along well with others in the same line . Trading among themselves was largely accommodation . One needing a windy for a deal , another would help him out . All took care of their animals . A trader might have a poor coat for himself , but there was a rubber or canvas blanket to keep the rain off his snide . There were traders who. did n't stop at trading , it must be admitted . For example , the two brothers whom retribution overtook . They bad a bulldog which they had taught how to catch a chicken back of the wings in such a manner that the fowl squawked not , and there was a chicken , so to speak , in every pot . On the road , the dog was tied to the reach under the wagon box . Stopping to water their team in a creek that was running high , the dog drowned , and the brothers went back to sowbelly . The running pony and the little pulling mare were useful side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a little town , some member of a trader 's party would remark that there was a boy out at the horse trader 's camp with a pony he thought was fast . The boy had some money saved , he bad beard , and it would he easy to get , if anyone had a really fast horse . A match would be arranged for 300 yards and twenty-five to fifty dollars , which the boy usually won . County fairs were good spots for this . At one of them an old fellow was riding around the track before the scheduled races , on a horse that dragged its right hind foot and seemed able to do no better than a trot , despite being pounded with at lath . The crowd hooted and the old man lost his temper . " This horse can run , and I 've got twenty-five dollars says so ! " he shouted . Tho challenge was accepted . A boy appeared from somewhere with a saddle that seemed to be just what the horse needed . He stopped dragging the hind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he was a : Thoroughbred , but he was the best horse on the track that day . Pulling contests were arranged with similar guile . The capper would be in a group at a barn or dray stand . The mare would be tied to a buggy . " You would n't think that little mare would outpull this big team , " the stranger would suggest . The custom , insisted upon by the trader , was to hitch to a wagon scale . The mare was like the trained weight lifter , the big team like the raw strong man . She knew about timing , getting the whole body into the swing , as it were . The terminology of the trader was crisp . To " come back with the halter " was to be beaten in a deal . A man without money in the spring bad been " winter-killed . " " Shut ' em down , " was to give temporary relief to windies and heavies or heavers . A heavy also was described as having " the thumps . " Drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canny buyer would go around next morning early . A bull-windy would go down a t little exertion . A windy was shut down by a sponge pushed up its nose . It then would breathe through the mouth . A string attached to the sponge permitted its removal . Another method , if the horse were being shown in motion , was a clamp over the nostrils , painted the color of the hair . Equine Face Lifting A wiggler , or bobby , had a spinal weakness that caused it to rabble behind . Such an animal would be hitched closely , traces and pole straps drawn up so there was no room to move . A freezer was one that could n't back . A smooth-mouth was any horse past , nine years old . That meant that the last dark cup in the teeth of the lower mouth  --  the cups disappeared two a year after five years  --  had gone . Horsemen pay less attention to the upper mouth , which will give the age up to eleven years . " Bishoping , " or " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth and color them with sulphate of iron , depending upon how " young " the horse was to be . The trader could do a bit of face lifting , making the sunken places above the eyes match the new teeth . A. hatpin incision would let in air and temporarily puff out the skin . If the horse were a grayhead , he would paint the eyebrows . The last touch was a rubber hand around the base of an ear , so that the horse held it forward instead of letting it flop back . One buyer named Jim had a legitimate process for treating sore-footed animals . He took horses thought unfit for service of street ears and hacks , and seemed to make them as good as new . He would not tell or sell his secret . Jim had come to Omaha from Chi-. cage , where he had suffered a loss . There he was a trader , with a beautiful horse called The Bookkeeper that he kept hitched to a small wagon near the yards . He looked like a farmer and The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His mother-in-law had died and he needed fifty dollars  --  and up  --  to get there . The fact that anyone would steal that magnificent-looking horse for fifty dollars helped Jim to rationalize the scheme . The harness had a large leather housing above the collar  --  not uncommon . When it was taken off , a fistula appeared . The buyer would protest , as the horse was worthless for legitimate purposes . Jim would say , " You bought him cheap . You bought him the way he was . You did n't ask me to unhitch . " But he would n't be hard ; be would settle for twenty or thirty dollars . Then ho hitched up again . The Bookkeeper would be sold as often as four times a day . He received the finest care . This TEE SATURDAY went on for a year . One day when the harness came off , the buyer was looking the other way . " Little raw place there , " said Jim . " All right , " the man replied . " I want you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't cheat . If a man do n't like my horse , I make it right . " The buyer said nothing . " Maybe you want your money back , " Jim said hopefully . " No . I bought that horse and I want him . " Jim offered a premium , but the man went away with his horse . He followed as far as Traverse City , Michigan . The other man was a trader too . It took a lot out of Jim . He could n't forget in the year or so that he was in Omaha . A trader , if he were swindled , was expected to do something about it . How one avenged his honor is told in the account of a deal between a road trader and a barn trader . Competent observers say that , man for man , the road trader was a little better than the barn man . Billy Cole , now in real estate , was a barn trader . He had bought for thirty dollars a big yellow hack horse with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Council Bluffs , Cole met a trader who offered a bay mare for the yellow plug . As far as appearance went , the bay was the best of the road man 's string . That was enough to warn Cole , although the mare passed all the tests he knew of . Curiosity and the seven and a half dollars boot the other man offered were strong , and he traded . Until next morning he could n't believe his luck . Then he could n't believe it either . The mare would n't back and he had to get a team to pull her backwards from the stall . If that were all , Cole thought , it still was n't a bad deal . He would keep her in a box stall . Then he just got his shoulder in the way of her teeth . So she was a biter . That called for study . Cole learned that the other trader was camped near town . He clipped the mare . With her legs trimmed and her winter coat gone , she was a beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M and began driving her to a sulky . When her own mother would n't have known her , he drove by the trader 's camp . Nothing happened . He went another day . The trader hailed him . Mare for sale ? No , belonged to the wife . Anything he would trade for ? No  --  well , maybe for that little span of mules there and twenty-five dollars . It was a deal . Fair Exchange and No Robbery The trader looked up Cole next day . " Get in this buggy ! " he ordered . " I 'm a-gain ' to take you , " the man said . " I 'm a-goin ' to take you and buy you a drink . " How did he learn he had got back his own mare ? It was when she bit him in the arm . A trader watched the eyes of another as a boxer does . Where he looked for defects in your horse was a good place to watch in his . A poke in the horse 's ribs was revealing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heaves or a tendency to fits . The trader had the percentage in his favor . The other fellow might know how to detect one , but rarely more than one , of a dozen ailments to which horses are subject . Charles H. Creighton , of Omaha , member of the family which founded Creighton University , operates a garage where he and his father , John D. Creighton , had what was called the world 's largest livery stable . He tells of a struggle between titans . EVENING POST " They were two good traders , " he says . " They sat on the curb outside a saloon . They would talk and whittle awhile , then go in for a drink . They started about nine o'clock in the morning and went on all day and part of the evening . Finally , one said , ' I 'll trade if you 'll set ' em up . ' They exchanged the horses which had been tied behind each man 's buggy and went in for the last drink . Then someone switched the horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into their buggies and went away , each leading his original horse . " John D. Creighton became a capitalist , but remained a trader at heart . To the last he kept his office at the Palace Stables . " This is my bread and butter , and where I have my fun , " he said . He bought horses at " from $5 to $5000 . " He could take care of himself , as Hilliker , young and confident , learned in his first experience . Hilliker had picked up a team of harness horses , nice-looking , but kickers . He took them to Creighton after working them down to a quiet state . They behaved perfectly , as anyone could see  --  that is , anyone but Creighton , who looked them over and said , " Well , son , it 's a good thing you have n't got a cut-glass dashboard .

He had n't mentioned it to John D. , who sat looking into the street and . complaining : " I have n't made a dollar all week . Wish I could make a trade . Why , if a circus came along , I 'd try to buy it . " Just then a gaudy wagon drawn by a big team with brass-trimmed harness and red lines came by . It bore the legend , Niobrara Menagerie . A block down the street , the driver got out , sat down on the curb and began whittling . That was all the elder Creighton needed to know , Presently , Charles noted the two men on the curb , both whittling . This went on for an hour . The man who wanted $00,000 called and Charles went to toll his father . " Son , I 'm busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went elsewhere for his money . The whittling continued for another hour before Creighton bought the outfit for $300 and drove it into the barn . Well pleased , he wont home to lunch . Charles heard a commotion . Drivers , coming to feed their teams , could n't get the horses inside . The odors of the Niobrara Menagerie terrified them . Charles moved the menagerie to the fourth and top floor . The senior Creighton returned serenely from lunch , and his self-satisfaction increased in the afternoon , when he sold the team and wagon for $300 , leaving a clear profit of an antelope , a timber wolf , two prairie dogs , a bobcat and a bald eagle . By this time two small black bears had been added , the gift of Charles , who bought them just to add to the general confusion . But his father promptly sold the menagerie to a city park and had his boot . When cars began to be cheap and dependable , the road trader 's decline set in .

When Every Horse Was a War Horse At the end , the road traders had just about what they began with . The business went . into the hands of dealers who bought , sold and shipped . Trading became negligible and confined for the most part to neighborhoods . A recent swap in Iowa was Page 1 news for the largest newspaper in that section .
