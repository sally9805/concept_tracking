txt One reason for the unwonted activity of German infantry on the Rhine-Moselle front in the past four days was revealed today  --  the Westwall is now manned entirely by units belonging to the regular army . They are fully trained men , many of whom doubtless fought in Poland . They have more punch than the half-trained reservists whom they have relieved . Their patrols and . scouting parties do not turn back , as before , as soon as they are fired at , but persevere until they can throw hand-grenades  --  now used by the Germans for the first time on the Western Front . The persistency shown by these German patrols in the last few days had led to the surmise that the German High Command might be preparing to execute its longawaited move . That it has replaced the reservists by regulars does not necessarily confirm this supposition , since it would be an elementary precaution if an allied attack were feared . Nevertheless the belief persists here that , with the " peace offer " already virtually rejected , the Germans will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Westwall garrison need not mean that such an action would come immediately . It is normal for troops taking over a new sector to reconnoitre the enemy positions in front of them in order to check the information passed on by the units that they relieved and also to endeavor to take prisoners to ascertain the enemy 's order of battle . This in itself would be enough to explain the insistent patrolling , which is mentioned again today in the French headquarters bulletins . Although German reconnoitring occurs intermittently along the entire front , it is always most marked in two sectors  --  the Moselle and Saarbruecken . For two or three days the patrols were satisfied to get the lie of the land . Yesterday and today they progressed within hand-grenade. range of several French advanced positions , possibly in the hope of enticing the defenders to engage in a hand-to-hand skirmish during which prisoners might be taken . But in each case the . French drove them back ' with machine-gun fire without the . need of coming to grips . These attempts were supported by artillery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each side has been able to spot most of the other 's guns , either by direct ground or aerial observation or by means of sound detectors , thus enabling the preparation of special charts known as " directing plans . " With the aid of these a reply to any battery 's fire becomes almost automatic . Despite a heavy rain , some German planes took to the air , but soon came down again . The day 's events are reported as follows in the French headquarters communiqu ? s : " No. 73 morning . Enemy patrols continue to be very active , especially east and west of the Saar River . There are reciprocal - artillery actions in these same regions . " " No. 74 evening . Between the Moselle and the Saar Rivers there was very great activity on the part of enemy reconnoitering elements . In this region we have driven back several raiding parties , some of which were rather- important in strength . " Increasing in Force This last sentence of Communique 74 is not without significance . It shows that enemy raids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From a squad or a platoon at the week-end they have now risen to company strength at least . To sum up , the last eight or ten days have seen the following developments on the Rhine-Moselle front : The French have further consolidated their positions . Their first line is firmly entrenched at the outworks of the Westwall and they are fully organized in depth behind it with heavy artillery and other material . Still further behind in the Maginot Line they await the German attack with confidence . The British have moved some units into the fighting line and , in Premier Edouard Daladier 's words tonight , an uninterrupted stream of convoys " is taking toward our frontiers the soldiers and guns of the British Army . " The Germans have brought up more artillery and replaced all reservists by regular troops . Their infantry and artillery are becoming more aggressive while they are manifesting more activity at sea . What does this portend ? Only the German headquarters knows . That it means to guard its secret seems indicated by the fact ' that all Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In recent weeks they had been permitted to telegraph to their papers very freely , even to the extent of giving details regarding certain new German material . Hand Grenades Used PARIS , Oct. 10 ( 20 ? Attacking behind squads of hand grenade throwers , German troops were reported tonight to be striking at French advanced lines on the Western Front with larger and larger units . The French military headquarters reported that all German attacks finally were repulsed . However , they said it was becoming harder each day to stop the advances of German patrols , which covered so much territory that they almost gave the impression of a coordinated feeler attack along a thirtyfive-mile front . French military reports said that the Germans were not thrown back by the first bursts of machine-gun fire as in the past , but sent new waves of men close enough to engage the French advanced lines with hand grenades . The grenade-throwers faced almost certain death , the French said , as they advanced through no man 's land ahead of companies supported by automatic arms . As they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they threw themselves to the ground . Then , at the first interval of fire , those who still were alive leaped forward until they were able to pull the pins from the grenades and toss them into French shelters . The French described the fighting as " savage " and declared that the Germans paid dearly for the thrust . not weaken German defenses in the slightest because the Rhine in normal times is an effective natural obstacle , becoming an even more imposing obstacle in time of flood . Afternoon newspapers reported that the German radio had asked Germans to send cough drops and lung and rheumatism remedies to the troops , but it was impossible to say whether the hint of ailments was anything more than wishful thinking on the part of the French . The newspaper-Temps reported tonight from Brussels that German labor battalions , working day and night behind screens . and under floodlights when necessary , had completed the Westwall extension along the eastern Belgian frontier . A full war-time complement of troops moved in a few hours after the labor battalions , left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Netherland - German Frontier , Oct. 10 ( UP ) ? Germans and Netherlanders crossing the Netherland-German frontier reported today that the Nazis were setting up hundreds of anti-aircraft batteries in anticipation of British bombing attacks from the North Sea on the Ruhr district . Guns have been arriving at Muenster and Osnabrueck railway stations steadily for a week and are being taken to positions along the frontier , it was said . North of Neuhaus , the travelers reported , a long chain of anti-aircraft batteries lines the border as far as the North Sea . Reports from the western German industrial districts said that the population was extremely depressed and that Gestapo agents were active in the region . Factory workers conversing in low tones on the way home are subject to suspicion , it was said , and secret police agents listen at windows at night to check on whether the household has its radio tuned in on foreign stations .

" Rhine River Rises PARIS , Oct. 10 ( UP ) ? Heavy rain in the Black Forest and lower Alsace threatened today to force the Germans to evacuate some of their lower blockhouses along the Rhine , as the river rose about two feet . The French terrain rises more precipitously than does the German and everywhere the Maginot Line is far enough from the river on commanding hills to escape any danger from high water . While the main Westwall admittedly was not menaced , certain new German blockhouses built within the past year appeared to have been placed too close to the water . They were said to have been flooded twice before , forcing troops to withdraw to higher ground . French observers conceded reluctantly that flood conditions would           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
