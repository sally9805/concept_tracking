txt Democratic prospects in this state seem to have improved somewhat in recent weeks as the result of the last-minute nomination of William H J. Ely , formerly state WPA administrator , for the U. S. Senate race against ex-Senator W. Warren Barbour , Republican nominee . Only the unexpired portion ( two years ) of a term is involved in this contest , however , and no great enthusiasm appears to have been stirred up among just ordinary citizens . Except for a few billboard posters here and there one would hardly know that a campaign is in progress in this part of the country . When John Milton , who was appointed to the Senate by Governor Moore to 811 the latter 's place in the Senate , flatly declined to run for the office in a general election tilere were some reports hereabouts that Mr. Barbour would have no Democratic opposition at all . But now there is to be a race and . New Jersey politics being what it is , neither candidate can count on a landslide . Democrats Now Have Edge It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contestant wins it can scarcely be by more than a margin of a few thousand votes while the Democratic nominee stands at least a chance of a more comfortable plurality In other words . the Democrat now has edge . This suggestion is based upon some rather interesting aspects of the New Jersey political scene as it is reported here by the old-timers . While it is true that the two major parties split the state 's Congressional delegation exactly 50-50 in 1936 and while the present indications are that the Republicans will elect more than half the members of the House of Representatives from New Jersey in 1936 , the senatorial race is a state-wide affair and subject to somewhat different conditions . Hague Machine Important To be specinc , two of the state 's congressional districts are overwhelmingly democratic while many of the Republican districts have been held in recent elections by narrow margins . As a matter of fact , Mr. Barbour will have to do very well in Essex , Camden , Atlantic . Bergen , and Passaic counties to get elected . Results in some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Bergen County where his local election record , for a Democrat . is amazingly good . His past connections with the WPA are expected by most unbiased observers here to help him . Lack of Interest Helps Ely Mr. Ely , of course . is making a big effort to cash in on Roosevelt strength in New Jersey , which is still considered highly important He seems anxious to give the impression that he would be a " yes man " for the President but not , of course . for the mayor of Jersey City . Mr. Hague . Mr. Barbour 's forces are stressing Hague support of their opponent rather than his Roosevelt support in the hopes that the so-called civil liberties issue will aid the G. G. P. The campaign has not progressed far enough to make the final outcome predictable with safety , but if present lack of popular interest continues and produces a light vote on election day , so much the better for Mr. Ely 's machinemade margins in the two big counties mentioned above . The Republicans still have an uphill battle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1938 from this , one of their old-time " stronghold " states .
