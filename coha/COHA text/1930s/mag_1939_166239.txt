WAR &; PEACE Record Sandwich <P> When the U. S. Senate convened last week , New Hampshire 's Republican Tobey asked consent to have Colonel Charles Augustus Lindbergh 's recent radio plea for isolated neutrality printed in the Congressional Record . Because Congress had yet to hear Franklin Roosevelt on active neutrality ( see p. 11 ) , Senator Tobey had to wait , finally got Charles Lindbergh into the Record two pages ahead of the President . <P> Columnist Eleanor Roosevelt then let herself in for a public panning . She wrote : " Are we going to think only of our skins and our own pockets ? " <P> Quoting that line without naming its author , Scripps-Howard Columnist Raymond Clapper sizzled : " I think it is very much to the point to be thinking of our skins-at least to be thinking of those American families whose sons would have to risk their skins . " Into the Congressional Record went the Clapper column , six pages after Franklin Roosevelt .               @ @ @ @ @ @
