txt A 13-year-old boy inmate of the New York State Training School for Boys at Warwick , N. Y. , broke down last night after two days of questioning by psychiatrists and told of murdering a 10-year-old chum three months ago in a quarrel over the division of stolen lead pipe and of hiding the body of his victim in a closet in an abandoned lower East Side tenement . Acting on the story , a squad of police went to the five-story tenement at 89 Madison Street , between Catherine and Market Streets , and after removing a pile of boards obstructing the door of a living room clothes closet in a fourth floor apartment , found inside , cramped into the small space , the body of the young victim . The police and tile boy inmate declared the victim to be Francis Xavier Laino , son of Dr. Frank Laino , an interne at Jamaica Hospital , Jamaica , Queens . The Laino boy had been missing from his home at 15 Oak Street since the morning of Sept. 18 , when he left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School on Catherine Street , where he was a fifth grade pupil . Doctor Unable to Identify Body Dr. Laino said , however , that he was unable to Identify the body as I that of his son , although the clothing resembled that his boy had worn when he disappeared . The Laino boy was reported missing the day after he disappeared by his grandfather , D'Annunzio Laino , who lives with the family at 15 Oak Street , next door to the Oak Street police station . For months the police checked the youth 's companions , seeking a clue . None was found . Finally , however , it was reamed from a playmate that the boy occasionally played with John Macari , 13 , of 325 East Sixteenth Street , who had been committed to the training school as an incorrigible truant early in November . The police wrote to the training school asking that the Macari boy be questioned about the Laino boy 's whereabouts . How the psychiatrists pried from the boy inmate the secret he had harbored successfully since he joined the 420 wayward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Williams , superintendent of the institution . " When the boy arrived he received physical , psychiatric and other examinations , but we had no way of suspecting his connection with the other case , " Dr. Williams said . " Our first intimation came a week ago when we received a letter from the New York police asking us to question the Macari boy about the other boy 's whereabouts . " He was questioned by psychiatrists and psychologists on the staff of Dr. Max Winsor , director of the school clinic . He denied that he knew where the other boy was but in the course of the questioning made an admission  --  that he had played with the other boy in a vacant house on New York 's East Side . " It was evident to the psychiatrists that he was not telling the whole story . We suspected that he knew where the boy was , from his manner . When you deal with hundreds of boys over a considerable period of time you can tell when they are telling the whole truth and when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspect a tragedy was involved ? merely that the other boy had probably run away and this boy knew something of his plans . " We communicated with the New York police . Yesterday the boy 's father and Detectives John Kennedy of the Oak Street Station and Cyril Berham of the Missing Persons Bureau came here . We permitted them to question the Macari boy . However , he denied any knowledge of the boy 's whereabouts , and , significantly , denied that he bad played with him . Finally , at 8 o'clock Thursday evening , he became upset , screaming through his tears that he knew nothing about the boy . " We saw that the three men were getting nowhere , except causing emotional disturbance to the boy , so we suggested that they go back and leave the matter to us . We were confident we could get the truth . So today we continued the questioning . He held to his story that he knew nothing about the other boy . " Late in the afternoon the psychiatrists talked frankly to the boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information that would be helpful . They told him that they were in a position to keep him from being abused in any way . Finally he told them that the boy 's body could be found in the vacant house at 89 Madison Street . " We ' informed the police of that and continued the questioning . We ' knew he had more to tell and we . continually sought to verify his admissions . " At last he told the story that was verified by the discovery of the body , secreted in the boarded-up building in the congested neighborhood , within sight of the Manhattan Bridge . " The Macari boy , " Dr. Williams continued . " said he and the other . boy had gone to the abandoned tenement , when they were supposed to be in school , to take lead pipe out of the house . After they had taken some they had an argu- ? ment , he said . about who was going ? to get which piece of the spoils .. John got into a temper , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of lead pipe . Then he hid him in a closet . " He became very upset after he had told his story . We sent him to the hospital to keep him under observation and to take care of him in the event of an emotional disturbance . He had done nothing out ' of the ordinary here . " From a study of the scene and from other information the police were able to fill in the details of the boy 's story . John knew there was lead pipe in the building because his grandmother had lived in the house until last March , when it was , vacated . From frequent visits to his grandmother he knew how he and his chum could get into the gloomy , boarded-up tenement with- , out arousing the suspicions of the caretaker . Both lads absented themselves from school that day . They were not schoolmates , so the coincidence escaped the notice of the investiga- , tors at first . The Laino boy told his grandfather he was going to school when he left the house . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house they had to go to the back yard and climb up the fire escape , for doors in the fourth-floor apartment had been nailed to the frames . By means of the fire escape they avoided the steeply winding staircases in the darkened halls , where the paint and plaster was peeling from the neglected walls . With the loot that was to be sold to a " junkie " gathered in the living room of the fourth-floor apartment , which faces a row of flats fronting ' on Henry Street , back of Madison , the argument occurred and the blow was struck . The smaller boy fell to the dusty floor . John tied the lad 's hands with rope . The clothes closet , barely a foot deep , was near by and John ' pushed the lad across the floor and into the little space . He sent the youngster down on his knees , with his head bent down upon them . , But still the door would not close ' off the small space , so he gathered some of the boards they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipe , and stacked them in front of the hiding place .. There was a crack left large enough so that the victim could not have suffocated . He left and said nothing . The abandoned building held his secret . Not even the trouble he had with his parents , when on Oct. 17 they had him committed to the institution , could force him to reveal the tragedy in which he had taken part . And not until he himself had told of the argument did the police learn that the boy they sought had been killed . Frank 's grandfather was unable to identify the body and , griefstricken , denied that it was that of ? his grandson . The youngster , he said , ? had worn leather shoes , whereas canvas shoes were found on the body . However , the colored shirt and dark trousers were identified by the lad 's father . Dr. Thomas Gonzales , assistant medical examiner , began an autopsy ? on the body . Because of its condition the fatal wound could not at first be distinguished . 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , six girls and four boys , of Philip Macari . 45 , a sweeper employed by the Department of Sanitation , and his wife , Frances , 37 . He lived with his parents , their baby , An- ' gelina , 18 months old , five other sisters , and three brothers , in a five-room flat at the Sixteenth . Street address , a five-story brick tenement between First Avenue , where the elevated trains rumble , and Second Avenue . Mrs. Macari , a worn ? tired womon , knew nothing about the trag- ; edy . Told , she sat herself at the kitchen table , and , wringing her I hands , she reiterated , " He never ! did it , he never did it . " " He was a good boy , " she protested . " He behaved around the house . Only he would n't go to school . He was sent to the training school for truancy . Two years ago he was sent to the Catholic Reformatory for truancy . That was for six months . This time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me every week how well he was doing and once he ' wrote happily he could come home for the Christmas holidays , he had been behaving so well . " John 's Letter to Mother Mrs. Macari displayed the last letter she had received . It came a week ago , apparently about the time the questioning began , and was undated . It read : " Dear Mother : " I am feeling fine and hope to hear the same from you . I wish you could come to see me every day . Write me as soon as you get my letter . How is my grandmother and grandfather and everybody at home ' Best wishes to all at home . How is Mike la brother ) getting along ? How 's the baby ? Your loving son . JOHN . " " P. S. Please do n't forget to write . " Mrs. Macari quieted the other children , who had been asleep in a big bed in the room off the kitchen and , awakened , were crying , and continued her defense . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said bitterly . " He may have been wild , but he would not have killed anybody . The detectives have been up here asking questions the past few days . They are trying to pin something on him which he did not do . I 'm going to get lawyers and fight . The detectives beat him to make him confess something he did not do . " The two detectives , accompanied I by an Assistant District Attorney , will go to Warwick this morning I to take a formal statement .
