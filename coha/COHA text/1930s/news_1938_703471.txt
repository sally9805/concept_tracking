txt Extension of the New York , Chicago &; St. Lonls Railroad Co. 6% unsecured notes for three years on a par-for-par basis without change inInterest rate , is proposed in a letter to stockholders by George D. Brooke , president . The notes which mature October 1 , are outstanding in amount ' of $14,988,750 of which $3 , - 583,750 are held ? by Virginia Transportation Corp. , subsidiary of Chesapeake &; Ohio Railway Co. , leaving $11,405,000 in hands of the public . Letter states that unless substantially all of the note holders agree to the extension , the road will inevitably be forced into reorganization under Section 77 . It is believed that the Chesapeake &; Ohio will not come to the aid of the Nickel Plate by buying up any important amount of non-deposited notes as it did in previous extensions . Untoward business developments , which have seriously affected earnings of the road and impaired railroad credit generally , have rendered impossible the retirement or refunding of the notes at this time , the letter states . Similar conditions in 1932 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year periods necessary . Says Prompt Action Necessary Prompt action on the part of the holders In depositing their notes , said Mr. Brooke , is necessary to avoid the serious consequences of a default . The Nickel Plate 's plan of extension , which is subject to Interstate Commerce Commission approval , provides for an exchange of the present notes for new ones , on a par for par basis , at a continuing 6% rate of interest , and maturing on October 1 , 1941 . As the present notes are deposited with the Manufacturers Trust Co .. agent and depository , transferable deposit receipts will be sent to the owners of the notes . When the plan is declared operative by the road , new notes will be issued and the full interest due October 1 , 1938 , will be paid , ? Plan provides that deposited notes may be withdrawn by the noteholders , without charge . at any time prior to the plan being declared operative , and that deposits may be made on or before August 31 , 1938 , or such date as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the letter reads , " were issued three years ago in exchange for a like amount of three year notes which matured on October 1 , 1935 , at which time , because of the reduced earnings of the company and the decline in market value or railroad securities . it was not possible otherwise to retire or refund the maturing notes . Improvements in Financial Affairs " Beginning about that time and continuing until the summer of 1937 there was a substantial improvement in the earnings of the company , " the letter continues , " and during this period the company was enabled to make certain definite improvements in its financial affairs . Two of its first mortgage issues were extended for 10 years at substantially lower interest rates ; short term indebtedness of more than $15,000,000 owing to the Reconstruction Finance Corp . and more than $4,000,000 to the Railroad Credit Corp . was retired by the sale of $16,000,000 principal amount of 10 year 4% collateral trust notes and by use of treasury cash . There has been a net decrease of approximately $3,250,000 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust obligations for the acquisition of a substantial amount of new rolling stock . The result of these transactions has been to reduce the annual interest charges of the company by approximately $250,000 as compared with the amount of interest paid during the year 1935 " Relating how the sudden reversal of the business trend , combined with the imposition of substantially increased costs , over which the company had no control , brought about an unprecedented decline in railroad income and credit , Mr. Brooke stated that for the first six months of 1938 the Nickel Plate earnings available for fixed charges amounted to only $1,730 , - 760 , or 48% of such charges and its cash position suffered accordingly . During recent weeks , he states , there has been a modest improvement in the trend of traffic .
