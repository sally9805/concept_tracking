For parents and teachers who come to grief when they try to persuade children to do their bidding , science last week had cheering news . Data was gathered by research at University of Michigan on how to talk to moppets and make it stick . <P> Dr. Marguerite Wilker Johnson , a supervisor of the University 's laboratory elementary school , tried out the relative effectiveness of cajolery , flattery , commands , threats and scolding on 40 matched pairs of children aged 2 to 8 . One youngster of a pair received specific instructions , the other general ones ; one simple instructions , the other verbose ; etc . All told , some 26 kinds of persuasion were tried . Highlights of Dr. Johnson 's report : * <P> &gt; An adult should use specific words . For example , twice as many children wound a swimming toy correctly when a teacher said " Wind it backwards " as when she said " Wind it this way . " <P> &gt; Simple instructions are more persuasive . When a teacher , pointing to glass toys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " 34 of 37 moppets did so . But when she said : " We have to be very careful of these glass animals . We wrap them up in tissue paper . We put them away in a red box . ... It would be too bad to break them . . . . You put them away , " only seven children responded correctly . <P> &gt; Pleasant words are more effective . When children refused to dress a doll , the teacher got much better results by saying " Please do " than by scolding : " I do n't understand why you refuse . . . . You should n't refuse to dress the doll . " Exception : to the pleasant approach one peewee responded : " Nuts ! " <P> &gt; A positive request is better than a negative one : Children were almost twice as careful when a teacher said " Keep the clay on the board " as when she said , " Try not to get it all over everything . " &gt; Encouragement is more effective than disapproval . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children were more persistent and successful than when she asked " Is it too hard for you ? " When she said " You can do it " in a sarcastic tone , they were discouraged . <P> &gt; Words that originally produce results have a lasting effect . Children specifically instructed to wind a toy " backward , " for example , were more likely to do it correctly without instructions a week later . To this rule there was , however , a significant exception . Although a simple command had a more potent immediate effect than a verbose explanation , the effect of the explanation was more lasting . Thus the children who were confused by a teacher 's discourse on the glass animals the first time , a week later were more likely to play with the animals and put them away voluntarily . <P> <P> *VERBAL INFLUENCES ON CHILDREN 'S BEHAVIOR-University of Michigan Press , Ann Arbor , Mich.
