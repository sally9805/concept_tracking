txt Just how bees happen to be designated as basic commodities in the amendments to the Agricultural Adjustment Act and the problem of controlling the love life of the queen bee under the proposed enlargement of the law were problems enlivening an otherwise dull debate as the Senate started work today on the amendments . Senator Glass , critic of New Deal legislation , gibed at the amendments with questions of how precisely he could control his queen bees on his Virginia plantation or be put in jail for failure to do so . Senator Smith , in charge of the bill , was equally sarcastic . Senators Fletcher and Tydings contributed to the discussion . - " I should like to have my idle curiosity gratified , " Mr. Glass drawled . " For a long time we have had quite an intense crusade to bring about birth control among human beings without success . I note here that we propose to confer upon the Secretary of Agriculture the right to bring about birth control among bees . I can understand that the drone bees after they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day at courting , " Senator Smith broke in. " . . . after they have had their day in court they are said to die off so that they may be self-controlled in that way unless they restrain themselves , " Mr. Glass went on . " But I should like to know exactly how ' the Secreta , ry proposes to control the queen bee , " he added as the Senate and galleries laughed . Senator Smith said he did not know much about the matter , but that a majority of the Agriculture Committee had voted to include bees under the bill . " Well , I have a good many bees . I do n't know how many are queens , but I am curious to know how I am going to control the queens , " Mr. Glass persisted . Mr. Smith said he had heard of a " peculiar queen known as the Italian which when put into a hive affects with an Italian flavor all the subsequent birth of bees in that hive . " Mr. Glass said the importation of the Italians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are " many of them already here . " Senator Fletcher suggested a particular license for the Italian queens . " Well , I want to understand how the Secretary can come down to my plantation in Virginia and require me to discriminate against my queen bees , " Mr. Glass went on with a chuckle . " The man owning a queen bee will be furnished with a logarithm for each bee that will solve the equation , " Senator Tydings put in . Senator Bankhead , taking the matter seriously , discounted the " facetiousness " of Mr. Glass and said the bee shippers wanted the queens included in the bill . " Of course the facetious remarks about birth control might as well be applied to fruits or vegetables , " Mr. Bankhead stated solemnly . " .1 ' 42 not facetious ; I 'm seriousz " Mr. Glass protested . " I do not want to be fined and put in jail because I can not control the actions of my queen bees . " Mr. Bankhead insisted that the section of the bill related only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , but it controls my queen bees or at least is designed to control them . " I should like to see the Secretary made the handler of these bees . " " I should n't object , " said Mr. Smith whose views rarely coincide with those of Mr. Wallace . Debate on the matter ended when Senator Fletcher urged amending the bill to provide " tupelo " flowers , a Florida product , for the bees . Non-controversial sections of the amendments were adopted . Declaring the Secretary of Agriculture possessed no new powers under the amendments , Mr. Smith argued that the bill embodying them cleared up " certain ambiguities of expression contained in the original bill , remedied certain injustices and brought the act into line with the recent NBA decision . " The Secretary of Agriculture , under the amendments , obtains power to levy processing taxes at a. rate that would equalize the difference between current farm prices and the fair exchange value based on parity with inddstrial prices during a fixed base period .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
