Senator Hugo La Fayette Black 's Lobby Investigating Committee last week launched a direct attack on the organizations whose business it is to attack the New Deal . Witnesses-of-the-week were Fred George Clark , Ohio oilman who leads The Crusaders , and Secretary Earley Vernon Wilcox of the Farmers ' Independence Council of America . From Crusader Clark the Senators got the story of his organization , founded to fight Prohibition , continued after Repeal to agitate for Constitutionalism , Sound Money , Balanced Budget , and the defeat of " the forces destroying liberty and individual freedom . " From Dr. Wilcox the Senators learned how the Farmers ' Independence Council , equally opposed to Government bounties and crop curtailment , was founded in Washington a year ago at a meeting called by Stanley F. Morse , then employed as " consulting agricultural engineer ' ' by the anti-New Deal American Liberty League . <P> But the genesis of these organizations was not the Senators ' chief concern . What seemed to interest them most was the interlocking connection between the organizations due to the homogeneity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Big Businessmen , the Committee was able to show that the Crusaders , the Liberty League and kindred bodies had many a mutual friend who was ready to play his antipathy to the Roosevelt Administration all the way across the board . Ironically , the list of men who endow the New Deal 's Opposition was found to include many a bigwig who belonged to the group that Herbert Hoover still thinks ruined his Administration . <P> The Committee 's roster of those giving $5,000 to $10,000 each to the Crusaders and $10,000 to $15,000 each to the Liberty League included Broker Edward F. Hutton , President George Monroe Moffett of Corn Products Refining , President John <P> Howard Pew of Sun Oil , Steelman Ernest Tener Weir , General Motors ' Alfred Pritchard Sloan Jr . The du Fonts exceeded all others in the size and distribution of their gifts . The Liberty League got $10,000 from Brother Lammot , $86,750 from Brother Irenee ; the Crusaders got $1,000 from Lammot , $10,000 from Irenee ; the Southern Committee to Uphold the Constitution got $3,000 from Lammot , $50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Women of Today . Lammot gave $5,000 to the Farmers ' Independence Council . <P> Crusader Clark had a list , too . It was a lineup of prospective contributors who had been urged to listen to a Crusaders ' broadcast . <P> " Who was John W. Davis ? " asked Senator Gibson of Vermont examining the list . <P> " Fie is a Democrat . He ran for President one year . " <P> " This Sewell Avery of Chicago , whom you list-is n't he chairman of Montgomery Ward and is n't he secretary of the Liberty League ? " <P> " We ca n't be responsible for everything they do . " <P> " Somebody got you up a good list . " insisted Senator Gibson . <P> " It did n't get us much money , " said Mr. Clark sorrowfully .
