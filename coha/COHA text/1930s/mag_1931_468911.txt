" Sir , " said Doctor Johnson , " a woman preaching is like a dog 's walking on his hind legs . It is not done well ; but you are surprised to find it done at all . " JANE graduated last June and in the autumn , after a pleasant summer in Europe , took a job . She is an intelligent , attractive girl who trots into the office promptly at nine and works industriously and competently at something or other ? with an hour off for lunch ? until five . Jane enjoys the high regard of a number of people , and it is the general opinion of her friends that she is bound to make a success of anything she puts her hand to . What are the chances of her making a success in business ? that is , a solid financial success ? The truth is they are extremely slim . Jane 's going into business was not a particularly daring or original stroke . In 19 ' 20 the Census reported 7,593,709 women wage earners in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduates , fifty-four per cent of Barnard alumnae are engaged in paid occupations . A questionnaire recently sent to Wellesley alumme showed that forty-six per cent of more than seven thousand are working . The American Association of University Women points with pride to the fact that of 6536 graduates of women 's colleges , only 730 , or under 12 per cent , had never been gainfully employed . In other words , there is no novelty about a woman 's working and getting paid for it , Jane happens to work in a publishing house . Twenty-five years ago she would almost certainly have been a nurse or a teacher , possibly a librarian . Still , she displays no pioneer spirit in her choice of occupation . There is not even the suggestion of the crusader 's white plume in her smart little hat . Nor would there be if she decided to go into a bank or a cement company . In practically every field of business and professional activity women are working in some capacity . Jane would not be the first of her sex to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager of a wire and cable company . She would not be the first woman to be a forestry expert , to raise reptiles , or to be the purveyor to Wellesley College . She certainty had no , social hurdles to leap when she decided to take a job . Her father and mother took her decision as a matter of course . Are n't all of her friends working ? And any inner qualms that they might have had were completely stilled when Ruddy van Varick 's youngest daughter took to selling bonds last year . ( Aunt Ernestine , who lives in the Faubourg St. Honore , thinks that her niece is being just a little silly , but then Aunt Ernestine has lived abroad so long she hardly understands anything . ) Jane does not minimize her chances of being in the Social Register or the Junior League ( which conducts an efficient employment bureau of its own ) nor , still more important , does she levels . From this report we gather the disheartening fact that the median salary of these women is $1548 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than K500 a year ; 6 per cent earn $3000 or more ; 1.3 per cent earn $5000 or more , and only .17 per cent have salaries of $10,000 or better . Of course , Jane may prove to be one of the seventeen women out of ten thousand who do make money , plenty of it , but the chances are 588 to 1 against her . The available figures on the earnings of college graduates tell a similar story . A group of 1250 Radcliffe alumnae reported their salaries as follows : 1087 received less than $3000 a year , 148 received between $8000 and $6000 a year , 10 received between $6000 and $10,000 , and a spectacular 5 received $10,000 a year or more . A group of Wellesley graduates engaged in non-teaching activities reported an average salary of well below $2,000 a year , while of 890 teachers from the same college , only 80 were earning $3500 or more . While it is true that among the outstandingly successful business women are some who did not go to college , all recent studies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that earnings increase with schooling . College graduates do earn more than high-school graduates . This holds true for women as well as men ; so , statistically speaking , it is safe to assume that the above figures give an accurate picture of what women arc actually earning ? the best of them . How do these earnings compare with men 's salaries ? The University of Michigan 's Bulletin proves conclusively that men with high-school educations earn more as a rule than do women college graduates , and that the average difference in earnings between men with A.B . ' s and women with A.B . ' s amounts to $4300 a year . A woman who earns $3000 a year feels that she is doing very well indeed . And so does everybody else . If she earns $5000 she is considered a success , and she herself knows that she is not likely ever to get much more . If she receives a salary of $15,000 she is a celebrity . A friend of mine told me of meeting an associate of her father 's who beamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and how does it feel to be a woman making five thousand dollars a year ? " She remarked to me ruefully , " I could n't take the wind out of his sails by telling him that I felt like an idiot for not earning twice as much . " The unflattering appraisal of women preachers , so vigorously expressed by the great Doctor Johnson , still voices the opinion of the world at large on the wage-earning woman . The wonder is she does it at all ? Let us give Jane the benefit of a great deal more perseverance , ability , and luck than most women ( eighty per cent by a conservative estimate ) possess and generously raise her to the magnificent height of $3000 a year . This she receives in exchange for working seven or more hours a day for fifty weeks out of the year . ( If Jane takes more than two weeks ' vacation it is called a leave of absence , and she receives no pay for this extra time . ) She is pointed out as a proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her friends ? those who said all along that she could succeed ? are splendidly vindicated for their faith in her . Well , we all know just about what $3000 a year will do . Some people will make it do more than others . It 's a tidy sum for pin money but alone is not adequate to a lofty scale of living . If Jane wants to live comfortably , dress attractively , hire someone to cook and clean for her , and put aside savings for the future , she is going to find that signally successful women in business . Why are n't there more of them ? Or , what is more significant , why should such women be news ? One obvious explanation of the small proportion of women who earn large salaries is their tendency to concentrate in fields where small salaries are paid . Although the proportion of working women who are teaching is slowly diminishing , recent figures show that one-third of all Radcliffe graduates of the last five classes are teachers ; so are one-fourth of all Barnard graduates and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report proves that the chances of making money are about twice as great in commercial and manufacturing organizations as in educational institutions , but 19.7 per cent of those 14,000 women are teachers . Likewise , the report proves that a much larger proportion of women engaged in sales work and publicity have high earnings than those in clerical work , yet 43 per cent of them , the highest proportion , hold clerical positions . The job of teaching and the job of secretary are admittedly woman 's work . They are also ( or , because of that ) low-paid jobs . Although the bars are down in all directions , women are not being very adventurous about forging ahead in places where money is made ? lots of money . They prefer to cling to the traditional occupations . I know an older woman , a librarian , whose name has considerable luster among her colleagues . She is enormously interested in her work , she has a national reputation among librarians , she is responsible for a number of ideas that have been universally adopted in libraries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she were starting to work to-day she would never choose a profession in which the monetary returns were so small . Thishard-headed appraisal of possible financial returns in an occupation is , I think , exceptional among women . Many intelligent women cling to lowsalaried occupations because they are more ladylike . Librarians , editors , teachers are unquestionably refined . Any occupation that has to do with books has the pleasing connotation of gentility and association with interesting people . That notion -- I almost said fiction ? is one of the most expensive luxuries which any working woman can have . Traffic in books may be very genteel , but traffic in beans or bonds or tooth paste is far more lucrative . Are the low earnings of women due to the attitude of business itself towards them ? Do women make small salaries because business men want them to ? Are business men actually hostile to the idea of women executives ? A great many women , apparently , believe this to be so , and it is a conviction that is widely expressed . It is curious , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is almost impossible to find a woman who will tell you precisely how she has suffered from prejudice or discrimination because of her sex . Only one incident have I heard to illustrate the handicap of being a woman , and that was not without the elements of comedy . A reporter confessed that she had been unable to interview a visiting Maharajah because , as the potentate apologetically explained , while the interview would give him the most exquisite pleasure , it would he most awkward for him at home if his subjects learned that he had been conversing with an unveiled lady . There is supposed to be a strong prejudice against women in medicine , but a young surgeon who has an important staff position in one of the large New York hospitals told me that she had never , in training or practice , met features told me that she felt sure that being a woman was a big asset in getting information , that she found a special quality of interest in the people whom she interviewed which made them eager to help her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts of hostility in her business career on the grounds of her sex . She will , on the other hand , meet with encouragement and approval , she will find people ready to give her a leg up . She will find that she can do the work allotted to her efficiently , possibly brilliantly . But she will not , unless she is the rare exception , find herself promoted into a big job with a big salary . IV The idea that women have not the stuff for promotion exists not only in the mind of the corporation president who , when there is a vacancy higher up , thinks immediately of a good man to fill it . It exists largely in the minds of women themselves . Their valuation of themselves in business is low . One of the reasons why women get small salaries is that they do not think they can get larger ones . There is , moreover , an astonishing gap between the stenographer and even the minor executive . The good secretary as she deftly types and files , takes dictation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not thinking of the day when she will be sitting in the president 's chair , giving dictation herself . She is thinking about the date she has that night , or her married sister 's troubles , or how she can fix over the blue cr ? pe de Chine , or how soon she will have to have another " permanent . " The office boy , on the other hand , true to the tradition of Horatio Alger and the American Magazine , already sees his name in gold letters on a mahogany door . This particular tradition appliesonly to men . Women do not face the terrific pressure of public opinion that insists that men shall be money makers . If they make five thousand dollars a year they are congratulated . Women walking on their hind legs ! If in a reasonable time Jane 's brother has not wrested a far larger sum than that from business he will be ashamed of himself ? unless he is a man of exceptional independence of character . He absorbs this tradition from the very air he breathes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although it may be an unworthy goad , do not forget that a goad is a goad . Jane is expected to be a charming girl and to make a good marriage . John is expected to make a good salary ? and a better one next year . Jane , herself , expects to make a good marriage . It is in the back of her mind , if not in the foreground . But she is taking her job seriously at the same time . She does not belong to the class of casual workers who lightheartedly dart off to the West Indies in the winter if an invitation happens along , but she may very easily fit into another group which , in the course of events , is not destined to gain large financial rewards . It is the amazingly large group which goes into business almost as a matter of course in order to attain a certain kind of life . A vast number of women , particularly those recently out of school and college , go to work as a means to an end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they want independent establishments ; and their fathers , however doting , do not recognize this necessity to the extent of bestowing an allowance sufficient for a snug apartment . Nor do the daughters want them to ( although occasional gifts of money from home are not refused on principle ) . Working is part of this scheme of living , and it 's an undeniably attractive scheme . The life that is lived by an independent rather than as a money-making affair that they will some day direct themselves . Certainly women do not buy stock in their firms to the extent that men do . A woman I know invested her capital of three hundred dollars , ten years ago , in twenty chairs , five tables , and enough pots and pans to cook the meals for twenty people . And then she wondered if twenty people would ever come into her tiny tea room . Now she is serving over one thousand meals a day in two flourishing restaurants , and owns , from the proceeds of this profitable business , several plots of New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story is not that she made a success . It is that she did n't make a real success until comparatively recently . She originally started her tea room because she wanted to live in New York , and wanted to live actively instead of idly . Until a few years ago she made a comfortable living , but she did n't make money . She did n't particularly want to . Two years ago she had a severe illness that lasted many months . She came out of it with an entirely different attitude towards her business . She began for the first time to think about the future . She had never amassed any money because she had not extended herself to that end . The idea of old age had never occurred to her , or if it had , it was probably counteracted by the comfortable feeling that some Santa Claus would come along and fix things because she was a woman . Suddenly , spurred by a bitter taste of disability , she pushed ahead , expanded the business , opened another shop , and adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial sum in ten years . She is doing nothing that she could not have done eight years ago . It took the shock of a terrifying illness to make her adopt an attitude that is professional rather than amateur . Another element in most women 's make-up that prevents them from making money is their inability to regard money itself very seriously . They persist in thinking of the stuff as something to be exchanged for eggs and clothes and steamship tickets . The advertising experts have worked out how much of the family expenditures are handled by the wives , and the amount is enormous . They do almost all of the buying , and they are shrewd bargainers . In many cases they will get more eggs for the same amount of money than men will . But money remains a means of buying what they want and need , rather than a thing in itself to be manipulated and multiplied . For this reason women can not look on the financial end of business with that absorption , that instinctive sense for the balance-sheet , profits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would rather have a congenial job that may not pay well than an unsympathetic one that pays better . Many women are intensely interested in their work and regard the pay envelope as a feature of it but not the most important one . To be sure , the pay envelope is usually so slim that it does not deserve a very solemn consideration . Moreover , many intelligent and able women deliberately refuse to make the sacrifices necessary to becoming big business successes . In a business world that is still geared for men , women have to pay a heavy price for financial success . They have to give up more than the luxury of lying late abed and going to concerts in the afternoon . A great deal of the business of living is still women 's business . There is no need to explain what women 's business is ? it is in essence what it always has been . We smile indulgently at the picture of our grandmothers who , as a matter of course , put in all the fine tucks in the shirts that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 1940 women will be making more money because by that time they will have convinced themselves and everybody else that they have the stuff for promotion . Suppose Jane is not compelled to earn her living , suppose she is working actually from choice , and that work is merely one factor among many in her rich and busy life . In that case ? although there is no justice in her earning less money than a man who is no more capable , intelligent , and industrious than she ? it seems to me that things being as they are , she loses more than she gains by trying to concentrate solely on the business of making money . There are lots of people doing that already ; and I ca n't help thinking it is a good thing for business and for the world at large that certain people are putting life before business and working because they like the job . However , this attitude , Jane must understand , is a luxury that she will do well to deny herself at the outset of her working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if circumstances prove it to be feasible . Uncle Jeremiah 's legacy may appear to be gilt edged , and of course most women do get married ; but there is always the chance that the legacy may prove to consist of mortgage bonds on deflated real estate or to have been lost in Montgomery Ward common , or the personable and opulent young man may not turn up . If Jane pins her faith on them rather than on herself she may very well have the disagreeable shock of waking up suddenly to the necessity of supporting herself when she is no longer young , and of finding that she has wasted too much time that she can never make up . If Jane from the very start will adopt the professional attitude , if she will give up all thought that it is adventurous or brave of her to work , if she will persuade herself that she and no one else is going to take care of her , that she is working because she has to and that she is going to keep on doing it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women who , whether they admit it or not , are marking time . Even at that she may end up in the smallest of cottages ; but it will at least be hers and not a charitable institution run by the State .
