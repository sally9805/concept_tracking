The Provisional President of Ecuador , stern-lipped Federico Pez suddenly announced his resignation last week , prepared to leave for the U. S. Since 1935 a tight little military group has ruled Ecuador . In September of that year they booted out Dr. Antonio Pons and replaced him with Pez as dictator . Last week , without leaving the saddle , the army coterie boosted into the Provisional Presidency War Minister Alberto Enrquez , who modestly admitted " the duties are too heavy for my shoulders . " Showing no signs of this weakness , he dissolved the National Assembly , announced that he had assumed " supreme power . . . in the name of the National Army . " At week 's end he inaugurated a " national political purge " to punish those who have " abused power . " This led observers to think that the military junta had sacrificed ousted President Pez as a scapegoat to divert attention from Ecuador 's internal unrest .                    @
