AFTER years spent writing our hazy comments and crotchety opinions , we finally wrote something that touched our public and brought a response . It was our whimpering little paragraph about the difficulty of using bath salts in a shower bath . Several persons wrote in posthaste and instructed us how to unscrew the cap of the pipe , insert salts in it , replace it , and allow the water to come filtering through . A concern that makes toilet preparations wrote indignantly , chiding us for not knowing about their Effervescent Salts , and telling us a dreamy tale of standing under the shower while the powdery flakes fell softly down over our glistening white body , softening the water in a bubbly fluff and perfuming the air of the whole room . It was such a sensuous , fragrant picture that we had to drop our work , shut our desk , and go home and take a bath . ONE interesting thing about Rudy Vallee 's book is the announcement on the jacket . " This is an authentic autobiography of Rudy Vallee and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only establishes Mr. Vallee 's literacy , it goes deeper . Here is a book written by its own author . It should be a great selling point and it suggests an idea to us , which we will pass on to publishers . Why not issue some of the older works in new editions and advertise them as genuine ? People would probably snap up a bargain such as " Little Women " ? absolutely written by Louisa Alcott . A TRAVELLER , footsore and 1 I dusty , comes to us from far Binghamton on the Susquehanna with great tales of a new departure in the restaurant business . The idea may well take hold here . It seems that a restaurant in Binghamton designates , on its bill of fare , certain dishes which it regards as peculiarly suited to ladies . The items so regarded are marked with an asterisk . Thus , the consomme is permitted to the ladies , but not the potage . Ladies may also have garden spinach , fried sweet potatoes , and turkey livers Creole with rice , while the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pork , mashed turnips , green-pepper salad , Edam cheese , and buttermilk . The only approach to this idea in New York that we know about is Alice Foote MacDougall 's , where a luncheon for little children is featured on the bill . We shall never forget the day we asked for it , and got turned down , big baby that we were . I this immodest and abandoned day , A we feel called upon to report any signs of civic modesty , or municipal purity . Luckily we have just come across a fine and hopeful example . A lady who lives in a hotel in Lexington Avenue has shown us a letter she received one day from the manager . " For the moment , " it says , " we have seven rooms occupied by men on the fourteenth floor . I hope it meets withyour approval . These men are here for a convention and we could not take care of them any other way . I offer this explanation in case you see a gentleman on the fourteenth floor . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon receipt of the letter , went out into the corridor , actually saw a gentleman , and fell down in a dead faint . WINDOWS of five-and-ten-cent stores have ever been an inspiration and a dream . These days they are better than ever . Four new ten-cent magazines are displayed  --  the Home Magazine , the Detective Magazine , the New Movie Magazine , and the Love Magazine . The titles are a roll call of America , a ten-cent cross-section , a dime view of the land . The contents are the answer to ten-cent humanity : home  --  the bid for finality and security , a home unlike the home one lives in ; detective stories  --  the release from Lel V home 's humdrum in a world of murder , crime , and terror ; movies the fantasia of life , the dream world of a hyperbolical people ; and love  --  the Ultima Thule , sex transcendent , beauty with the power to free . We often pause , in the crush of sidewalk life , to wonder about that last magazine , Love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love ? Are any of them married ? Once we even saw ourself , in our imagination , as a reporter for the Love Magazine . We saw ourself caught in a hypothetical infidelity by a purely hypothetical wife , and explaining airily that it was " just a little job " we were doing for the magazine . ? A STORE on a side street , just off the Bowery , displays on its window in gold letters the word " Noolas . " You read it backwards  --  and use your own judgment . Those Names WE 'VE been much happier since V finding out the truth about Pullman-car names . The truth is that Mrs. Frank O. Lowden ( nee Florence Pullman ) does ? sot name the cars , and does not receive thirty thousand dollars a year for doing it , as has been solemnly rumored . The cars are named by a committee , and it 's a secret who the members are . As far as we can gather , the only car named after a. living person is the Colonel Lindbergh . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polo and Oliver ' Wendell Holmes . The first Pullman car to get a name was the Pioneer . viously it had been called just " A , " because in the early days there was a plan on foot to designate all Pullman cars by letters of the alphabet . The plan worked finely until the twenty-. seventh car was built . Car " A " was also the first car built completely by George Mortimer Pullman . It cost about twenty thousand dollars and was a rush job  --  rushed through so that it could form part of the funeral train that bore Abraham Lincoln 's body from Washington to Chicago and thence to its final resting place in Springfield . Although to a casual traveller the Pullman names seem to have no rhyme nor reason , there are certain principles that seem to underlie the nomenclature . Parlor cars , for example , are usually given feminine names , or the names of birds and flowers . Sleeping cars , generally speaking , are named for rivers , lakes , cities , towns , countries , local historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battlefields , and camps . Of recent years an attempt has been made to classify the cars according to names . Thus , all cars named Mount Something are observation cars containing sections . All cars named Great Something ( like Great Spirit , Great Plains ) are on the Great Northern Oriental Limited run . The Sunset cars ( Sunset Beach , Sunset Cape ) are on the Sunset Limited . Cars for the California Limited of the Santa Fe are given the prefix " Silver . " Certain special cars , with compartments and drawing-rooms , are named for literary folk  --  poets , dramatists . The Lake , Camp , and Fort cars are all one type  --  ten sections , drawing-room , and two compartments . Also there is a brand-new series , Saints and Macs , which has twelve sections and one drawing-room . Hard to remember , but interesting . On the Congressional Limited the cars are named for the signers of the Declaration of Independence . One funny thing happened . It was when the Pullman Company took over the Wagner sleeping cars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names , and naturally something had to be done about that , and done quick . So a vice-president led a battery of clerks to the Chicago public library , and began delving deep into Roman and Greek history . It was n't twenty-four hours before there was a wholesale christening of the three hundred Wagner cars , and some lovely names there were , too . Noble Experiment ' r HE prohibition issue crept quite charmingly into the Flower Show last week , and then was seized by the scruff of its neck and thrown out . It was most amusing to a little group of ironists who watched . The Federated Garden Clubs of New York State were holding an exhibit of dinner tables set in the period between 1820 and 1880 , known sometimes as the good old days . Naturally enough one very handsomely appointed table held decanters filled with what looked like wine . In the midst of the judging , a short , stocky , firm woman , apparently in charge of most everything , barged up to the lovely table with a charwoman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dump the contents of the decanters into the bucket . The exhibitor protested bitterly , pointing out that it was not real wine , but merely colored water . The lady explained that this did n't make any difference , and that the W. C. T. U. had once before raised a row over a somewhat similar exhibit . She said the W. C. T. U. did n't like to see anything on a table that even looked like wine . So the decanters were drained . The little group of ironists stood silently looking at the outraged table for many minutes and then went home . oop NOW and again we print an anecdote which brings ripples of lovely laughter from the bright throat of our niece ? not because she thinks it 's funny but because she happens to know that it originated with O. Henry , or Shakespeare or somebody . It now appears that the one we published about the discontented sailor who said he was going to set out with a pair of oars on his shoulder and not stop going till he found someone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told by Homer , the Greek poet , two or three thousand years ago , and as well as we told it too . A Mr. de Rochemont has copied it for us out of Butcher and Lang 's translation , Book XI , ca. verse 119 : " But when thou host slain the wooers in thy halls ... thereafter go thy way , taking with thee a shapen oar , till thou shalt come to such men as know not the sea , neither eat meat savoured with salt ; yea , nor have they knowledge of ships of purple cheek , nor shapen oars which serve for wings to ships . And I will give thee a most manifest token , which can not escape thee . In the day when another wayfarer shall meet thee and say that thou ' last a winnowing-fan on thy stout shoulder , even make fast thy shapen oar in the earth and do goodly sacrifice to the lord Poseidon .... " Now let some scholar come along and tell us where Homer got the story . Gus G us , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the artists ' entrance  --  of Carnegie Hall , will soon be deserting his post for a time . He is going to Europe with the Philharmonic on its spring tour  --  ostensibly as assistant haggagemaster to the orchestra , but really to see the Derby run . He has n't been in London for over forty years , and when Mr. Arthur Judson , who is manager of the Philharmonic , heard this , and heard too that Gus had a passion to see the famous race , he fixed it up for him to go . Gus  --  his full name is George Augustus NVadc  --  was horn in London sixty-seven years ago , and one of his boasts is that he has spent fifty-five years of his life in uniform . The last thirty-three years , he has worn the uniform of Carnegie Hall ; before that , for eight years , he was togged out as a bandsman in the circus ; before that , he wore the uniform of Her Majesty 's Grenadier Guards . He was twelve when he enlisted in the Guards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he was still a boy , he was on guard duty at Buckingham Palace , during the wedding of the Duke of Edinburgh . It was cold , and a kind-hearted duchess brought him a glass of hot rum punch ; an officer saw him , and arrested him for drinking while on duty . The duchess , however , got him out of it . Later , he went out with Kitchener to the relief of Khartoum . chased Arabs , drank a pint of rum every night for his stomach 's sake , had a grand time . Once he was stationed at Cyprus , six thousand feet above sea level : they shot eagles for recreation , and watched the goings-on about their own troopships , in harbor forty-five miles away . Another time , his regiment was in a six weeks ' forced march across the Suez Peninsula , during which they never had their clothes off once . When they reached the seacoast , the whole regiment stripped and went for a bathe in the ocean , while the supply sergeants made a bonfire of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his fighting . He came to this country and joined the circus , playing the flute , trumpet , or bugle , as occasion required . He liked circus life too . He is short , stout , with a plump genial face and a drooped mustache . After so varied a life , however , he is not lacking in a certain dignity . In fact , very often , when he comes out on the stage at Carnegie to open the piano or move chairs about , he gets a round of applause from people in the audience who have been misled by his dignified bearing into thinking he is the soloist , despite the fact he is in uniform . Gus gets a good deal of pleasure , in his quiet way , out of this . He himself , of course , knows all the artists , their habits , their idiosyncrasies . After thirty-three years ' experience , he knows how long , to the minute , each conductor takes to play every piece in the Philharmonic 's repertory , and he is a martinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just in time to rush down with floral offerings when the last note has been played . Besides seeing the races and looking up some of his old army friends , there is just one other thing Gus is looking forward to , when he gets on the other side . He is going to buy himself a bang-up new pipe . He says you ca n't get a good one anywhere outside of London . Sales Assistant HIGH-POWERED thoughthey he , the big department stores have no natural merchandising genius  --  genius , for example , such as one finds in the bazaars of the East Side . We are thinking at the moment of Samuel Shipman , merchant of Orchard Street , dealer in corsets , brassieres , and things like that . Mr. Shipman 's pushcart is enlivened by a parrot that sits there , looking sharp . We paused for a few minutes in passing , strangely drawn by the pinkish rumpled garments and the greenish rumpled bird . After we had hung about , tentatively , for two minutes , the parrot cleared his throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can command , he addressed us as follows : " You 've looked at everything , you 've felt everything , why do n't you buy something ? " There was nothing for it but to pick out a good brassiere and be on our way . The Muse THE police- I- man with shield No.12701 , stationed at Forty-seventh Street and Seventh Avenue during the theatre rush hours , entertains the pedestrians , while they are waiting for the green light , by reciting his own poetry . For example , he said to one lady , " Lift up your feet when crossing the street . " He has much longer flights , however . That same evening he recited a little thing of his own which went like this : On the other hand , Guard No. 05493 ( downtown express platform of the Eighty-sixth Street subway station ) is an observing philosopher , not a minstrel . On a recent rainy morning he said to a gentleman  --  who instantly came to this once and reported it ? " Down here we do n't actually know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like the weather . I know it 's cloudy and had this morning . Not a single smiling face , all unhappy . Yes , sir , you can always tell the weather from the people 's faces . " Book Doctor IFyour rare leather bindings are get- ting creaky at the hinges and in general are going to pieces , the person to sec about it is Miss Janet Lewis , at 15 West Forty-seventh Strect . She and her assistants spend all their time going around to people 's libraries , treating the bindings with a special ointment designed to save them from decay . She has rubbed up the libraries of Mrs. Edwin Gould , Mrs. Seward Webb , Mrs. Whitelaw Reid , and Mrs. Bayard Cutting . She started on her career in 1908 , when her friend Mrs. Richard Morris Hunt asked her what to do about some old French bindings she had inherited . Miss Lewis at that time was a portrait painter ( she founded the Pen and Brush Club ) but the problem of preserving ancient bindings appealed to her , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She tried that but it did n't do much good . Next she tried a rare black oil made from prehistoric fish deposits . This worked , but it was hard to get . Finally , with the aid of a chemist , she worked out an ointment made of oils more easily obtainable , a formula she has kept secret . She has worked in many of the famous libraries , including J. P. Morgan 's , where she fixed the geography book of Mary , Queen of Scots , for which the elder Morgan paid over thirty thousand dollars . The binding dated from the sixteenth century , and its intricate gold tooling was in danger of breaking . Now , after a treatment of Miss Lewis ' fluid , it will last another four hundred years . She has fixed five Shakespeare first folios . One , valued at fifty thousand dollars , was in Marsden J. Perry 's library of Shakespeareana . She restored its color with leather dyes , then rubbed it fresh and soft again . Mr. Perry , by the way , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in to watch her work . Most people do . Once she rubbed twelve thousand books , all about fish , for the late Daniel Fearing , with Mr. Fearing watching all the time . One of Miss Lewis ' hardest jobs was Dr. Vollbehr 's collection of incunabula . Fresh from the cool vaults of European monasteries , the volumes were put on exhibition in New York and Chicago , and the heat almost ruined their bindings . Miss Lewis worked over them for a week before they were all right again . Generally it does n't take so long . Most of her assistants can handle anywhere from one hundred to a hundred and fifty hooks a day if they do n't steal time out for reading . She herself can do two hundred . Ladder 's Top HOLLO as life is , it 's not hollow W to some people . We cite the case of a fellow in a bank . Not long ago he was talking things over , reflectively , with an acquaintance and this , so help us , is what he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to think of it . Came here from St. Paul , landed this jab , and inside of three years I 'm married to a girl in the Social Register . We have a duplex apartment in East Sixty-fourth Street , with a butler and all like that . " Here he paused briefly and looked at his friend in a kindly way . Then he proceeded in an even tone : " You and your wife must come to dinner some evening . I 'll send you a printed card . " Old Rider A4ST week we paid a respectful call on Mr. Frank Tully , the grand old horseman . He lives in East 117th Street in a neat red house full of hunt ing prints . He was the first man ever to put a horse over a six-foot bar . This feat he accomplished on Decoration Day , 1886 , in the old Madison Square Garden . He still lives in its memory , and in the memory of the days when horsemanship was the mark of a gentleman . Mr. Tully , now seventy-three , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He came to this country in his teens , the son of an Irish horse dealer , and at twenty years of age was in charge of the late August Belmont 's stable on Long Island . Later he took charge of the Meadow Brook horses as well . Those were the days when August Belmont , Stanley Mortimer , John Sanford , Thomas Hitchcock , E. D. Morgan , James Gordon Bennett , Pierre Lorillard , and Adolf Ladenburg were names to be conjured with in horse circles . One day at Hempstead , a year or so after the famous six-foot jump , Belmont bet Tully a hundred dollars he could n't jump his horse over a five-foot bar w ith a water ditch in front of it . There was snow on the ground . Tully did it , and offered to put another foot on the bar for another hundred dollars . He wan this also . Tully 's hunting prints are good ones . He got them at auctions . Sometimes he rents them out , but always refuses to sell them . ( John McEntee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He also has some very excellent china , and some very excellent and lively little Pomeranian dogs , which he raises . The dogs romp around in a parlor full of their trophies and blue ribbons . Tay goes off hunting now and then , and sometimes goes to Newport in the season . At seventy-three he is still a fine-looking man , mildly resentful of a life of comparative idleness among Pomeranians and prints , always dreaming mellow dreams of the times when the old polo fields were at 110th Street and when he could sit a horse with the best of them . Sonny Boy IT was with a certain dismay , tinged with fright , that a gentleman and his wife , returning from Florida , discovered that twenty-four bottles of pretty good wine had disappeared .
