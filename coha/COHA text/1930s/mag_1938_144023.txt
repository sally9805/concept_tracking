ARMY &; NAVY <P> When someone describing himself as " Mr. Weston , Under Secretary of State telephoned the U. S. Passport Bureau in Manhattan last fortnight and asked that 50 blank passports be sent to him at a midtown hotel , agents of the Department of Justice followed the shipment . Well they might , for the Under Secretary of State is Mr. Sumner Welles . The trail led from the hotel to a bar , to a brush-headed young man named Guenther Gustave Rumrich . Mr. Rumrich-born in Chicago to Austrian parents 27 years ago and a deserter from the U. S. Army-was reported to have wanted the passport blanks for the use of an international " spy ring . " By week 's end the agents arrested two of Mr. Rumrich 's alleged confederates , Erich Glaser , a 28-year-old German-born private in the 18th Reconnaissance Squadron stationed at Mitchel Field , New York City 's air defense centre , and Johanna Hofmann , a 26-year-old German hairdresser on the liner Europa .

Spy Hofmann who spoke no English and whose orange-colored hair showed traces of dye , was arrested on the Europa with several letters she had been engaged to deliver , including one offering $1,000 for information about the Navy aircraft carriers Enterprise and Yorktown . Rumrich and Glaser had both been stationed during their Army service in the Canal Zone . Only document of importance which it was suggested they might have stolen was a copy of the secret codes of the Air Service , and Army authorities doubted that . <P> An indication of the value which his foreign employer put on Mr. Rumrich was his salary : $50 a month . But he had cherished at least one melodramatic and incredible plan , which his superiors prudently quashed before he had a chance to try it . It was to lure Colonel Henry W. T. Eglin from his post with the 62nd Coast Artillery at Fort Totten , N. Y. to a Manhattan hotel , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hofmann or by violence , to surrender certain " secret mobilization plans . " <P> Net result was a story of espionage which made Army officials wonder whether the spies or Mr. Cummings ' agents who arrested them had been the bigger bunglers.
