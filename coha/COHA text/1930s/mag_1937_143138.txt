Looking much like an extremely competent and self-effacing butler , a tall , baldish German walked upon the stage of Manhattan 's Town Hall one day last week to give the first important recital of the U. S. concert season . Pianist Walter Gieseking , absent from the U. S. for two years , had already established himself as a prime interpreter of the subtle iridescences of Claude Debussy . Long before he reached Debussy ( which he admits he plays " the right way . . . without any noticeable motion of the fingers " ) , Gieseking made his audience aware that in two years and more than 200 European concerts his playing of Bach , Mozart , Schumann had gained in nobility and strength . And he braved the showiness of Liszt so capably that his audience might never have guessed , had he not mentioned it to an interviewer beforehand , that he had contemplated revising his program to spare his right thumb which , outstretched , had lately collided with his garden wall in Wiesbaden . <P> Walter Gieseking , beginning a transcontinental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is topped by Rachmaninoff and includes able Rudolf Serkin , Alexander Brailowsky . Hulking , oddly demure of face . Pianist Gieseking will reach California in December . There he likes to relax by hunting butterflies . Son of a German physician and entomologist , Gieseking has one of the largest privately owned collections of butterflies in Europe . He has detected resemblances between California butterflies and European species , believes their forebears migrated by way of Asia and Alaska thousands of years ago . Once Gieseking found six caterpillars in Berkeley , took them on tour and back to Germany where , to his great pleasure , they turned out to be not only butterflies but " beautiful .
