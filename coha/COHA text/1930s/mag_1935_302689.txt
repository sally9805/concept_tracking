A laundryman was swept out as publisher of Hearst 's Washington Times last week and the son of a carpet-cleaner prepared to move in . The laundryman is George Preston Marshall , handsome , flamboyant owner of Washington 's prosperous <P> Palace Laundry system . He was the 17th Times publisher hired &; fired by Hearst in the last ten years . Long after the first 16 are forgotten , beery oldsters will chuckle over the escapades of the 17th . <P> Exactly a year ago tall , dark George Marshall , without a speck of publishing experience , was put in charge of the Times . He began life as a smalltime vaudeville hoofer . During the War his father died , left him a bankrupt laundry . From it Son George built the most successful laundry business in Washington , with 50 gaudy blue- gold branch stores on strategic street corners , each blazoning the slogan " Long Live Linen . " <P> Convivial , gregarious George Marshall belongs to the night-club era of his friend " Jimmy " Walker . Like the onetime Mayor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late for all appointments . A two-hour nap after 5 p. m. tunes him up for his evening rounds . He delights in confounding dowagers . He astounded a dinner party one night by shrilling : " Congratulate me , folks ! I 've finally arrived socially . Today I got the sheets of Mrs. ' Bordy* Harriman . " His friendship with the elder Hearst sons , notably John Randolph , prompted the traditional summons to the Hearst castle at San Simeon , Calif. , the offer of a job . <P> Immediately Publisher Marshall set out to make the Times a fit background for himself . He installed a gold-braided doorman with " Times " across his visor , put all the art staff in smocks with " Times " across the fronts , had the building painted pale grey outside , white- &-tan; within , had large gilt eagles painted on all doors . <P> Not all the Marshall innovations were trivial . He persuaded fashionable young matrons of the capital to work for the Times . Betsy Caswell , widow of the Shenandoah 's Commander Lansdowne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported politics ; plump Nina Carter Tabb covered the hunts of the swank Middleburg and Warrentown set . Hugely successful , their columns helped budge the Times ' circulation up to 106,800 , only 6,300 less than the venerable Washington Star . <P> Nevertheless Publisher Hearst was not pleased . Trouble-shooting executives were sent to Washington to squelch Publisher Marshall , to order him to keep , out of the editorial rooms and attend solely to business . He became a Hearst problem . Last week he became a deeply aggrieved Hearst has-been .
