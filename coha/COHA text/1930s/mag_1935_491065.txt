THE plaint of the average citizen in recent years has been that too many criminals escape , either from arrest or from the courtroom . Therefore , the methods of a tremendous law-enforcement organization which not only gets almost every man it starts after but convicts him after it gets him become worthy of recital . This agency , of course , is the Division of Investigation of the United States Department of Justice , as it has been built up in the last ten years under the directorship of J. Edgar Hoover . Mr. Hoover is a comparatively young man  --  in fact , just looking at forty . The underworld , however , calls his Division " The Old Guy With the Whiskers , " thereby typifying the power , the inexorability and resources of Uncle Sam . As far as big criminals are concerned , the average of convictions is almost perfect ; only the fact that many lesser lawbreakers are often arrested with the main offender and that juries , even judges , are predisposed to leniency in such cases reduces the percentage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conviction record of 93.81 out of a possible 100 , which , when one considers the results of county and state prosecutions , approaches the miraculous . The reasons are to be found in the intricate workings of this branch of governmental activity , which functions in every state and all the United States possessions . No matter what problem may arise , there is a machine or a formula , a means of identification or a scientific procedure , a time-proved method or a specific man with a specific training to fit the job . As an example : There were no clues when a special agent of the Division of Investigation arrived at the White River Indian Agency , some ninety miles northeast of Globe , Arizona , to investigate the death of Henrietta Schmerler , of New York City . A student in the Anthropology Department of Columbia University , she had been assigned , on funds provided by the college , to study the lives of Apache women and children . Shortly after her arrival at White River , circling buzzards had led Indian searchers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stabbed and mutilated . Crimes on Government reservations lie in the jurisdiction of the Division of Investigation . Round Reg in a Round Hole B EFORE the special agents arrived , seven Indians had been arrested by local authorities as the possible murderers , only to be released . Some thirty other Apaches and white persons had been questioned . all to no avail . The Indians themselves had adopted a slogan which they passed from one to another ; " no talk , white man find out nothing , " except when they tried to fasten the guilt on some near-by Navajos . Yet within a comparatively short time , the special agent had his man , Golney Seymour , who had not hitherto been under suspicion . The Apache confessed that he had killed the girl when she resisted his attentions as they rode to an Indian dance . The solution , as it often happens in Division of Investigation cases , lay in Mr. Hoover 's selection of the man to break the mystery . The roster of the 528 special agents reveals on the surface that more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expert accountants , but nothing is said of prior occupations . So , instead of a mere group of lawyers and accountants , the division is composed of men who can instantly revert to a former life as farmers , ranchers or prison workers , newspaper reporters or post-office clerks , aviators or carpenters . One finds chauffeurs in the list , boiler makers , deck hands , oil workers and telephone men . There are others with training as tractor drivers , electricians , mechanics , lumber-camp workers , insurance men , or amateur find professional athletes . Even life guards , mine foremen , radio operators , seamen , telegraphers , printers and painters appear in the card files , together with a half hundred other vocations . In the Schnieder case , Mr. Hoover called upon a special agent who had been a trapper , cowboy , sheriff and all-around Indian expert ; sufficiently expert , in fact , that during one investigation in Oklahoma he posed for months among the Osages as a medicine man and took part in their tribal councils . He knew Indian psychology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions and when to remain silent , meanwhile proceeding upon a. course of ingratiation . At last the Apaches began to trust him . One secretively told him a rumor , to be substantiated through others , these rumors leading closer and closer to facts . Finally , the special agent brought . in Golney Seymour and , instead of asking him questions , told him , move by move and action by action , exactly how the Apache had committed the murder . The superstitious Indian could think of only one explanation  --  white-man magic . He confessed and went to prison for life . On the Trail of Seuenty-Five Automatics 7 4VEN in this comparatively simple case , there had I been a wealth of supporting efforts . Special agents in New York had conducted investigations to learn if Miss Schmerler had mentioned anyone in her letters who possibly could have committed the crime . There had been queries as to any money or jewels which might have provided a motive ; of necessity , her every associate had been checked to preclude the theory that someone might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a way that Indians could be blamed . The obvious must not be taken for granted ; the Division of Investigation believes as thoroughly in proving innocence as in establishing guilt . Thus , when a case comes to trial , defense attorneys can not lead the evidence into a morass of suspicions against some dark horse . Special agents have been over all that ground and can prove it barren . As a rule , much of this work is done in close cooperation with local law-enforcement agencies ; often the actual arrest falls to city police on identification as furnished by the Division 's fingerprint bureau , recently described in THE SATURDAY EVENING POST . Or perhaps the pick-up has come as the result of the Fugitives-Wanted Bulletin , which once a month travels from Washington to every law-enforcement agency in the country , and which carries , in addition to the names and aliases and descriptions of major criminals , a reproduction of one fingerprint ; further identification to be made when this matches a corresponding one in a suspect . However , arrest , in actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of some stolen pistols and the complications to which they led may afford an example . First , however , a prelude . A number of years ago , a young man named Johnny Lazia walked out of the Missouri Penitentiary , pardoned as the result of activity by influential persons in Kansas City . He became a part of a political machine and steadily grew more powerful , gradually centering his attentions more and more upon the police department . At last it was rumored-in- the , underworld that any friend of Johnny Lazia need have Pew fears of prosecution . He was said to control such money-making devices as liquor and gambling . However , this seemed to have no connection whatever with the fact that seventy-five Army automatic pistols disappeared one " night from the Na. tional Guard Armory in Kansas City , Kansas , across the river and the state line from Kansas City , Missouri . Theft or illegal possession of GoVernment property lies within the jurisdiction of the Division of Investigation ; special agents took the ease . There were no fingerprints or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers of the guns in the records . A year passed without results . One night some young Italians were arrested for investigation , Two guns were found in the car , which they insisted did not belong to them , in as much as they had borrowed the car . Then the silence of Little Italy closed about them and little more-was to be learned . The special-agents started out to check the ownership of the borrowed automobile . It is a rule that no detail of a ease be omitted , even though this may lead to a mass of information which to the uninitiated seems utterly useless . If a man is being investigated , every angle of his life also is investigated . His habits are noted , whether he smokes cigars or cigarettes , what newspapers he reads , whether he likes to walk or , if not , what kind of a ear he uses ; on and on it goes , even to his tastes in movies . It was not at all surprising to anyone familiar with the workings of the Division of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a motion-picture theater in Chicago . Long before , meticulous special agents had established that Dillinger not only liked movies but that he would even leave a place of hiding against the protestations of his gang and risk his life to see some picture in which he was interested . He risked it once too often . While a person under investigation is being catalogued in every possible way , his relatives and his friends undergo the same process . The pursuit of those guns at last led to the owner of the car , who successfully denied the possession of the stolen property . Nevertheless , the agents had progressed ; this man was a relative of Sam Scola , known in the underworld as one of Johnny Lazia 's enforcers in the liquor and gambling rackets , and a man from whom a killer could get a gun if he needed it . Again the slow piling up of information began , a terrific task when one knows the silence which surrounds gangsters . Three months passed . Then one night , the county sheriff , Tom Bash , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were returning through town from a picnic when they heard shots . The sheriff stopped his car and leaped out , his riot gun ready for action . Two men wore half trotting down a residential street , followed by an automobile which , coming from a scene of murder , was about to pick them up . Three of the gangsters started firing at Bash while his deputy drove off a fourth , the assailant escaping between to the Government for the possession of those stolen Army guns . Claiborne , the detective , was asked to appear before the Federal grand jury to repeat his story of finding and tagging the pistol he had found between the houses . The jury listened  --  and indicted him for perjury . He appealed his ease as did Gar-gotta , This time , when Gargotta came to trial , no woman appeared to testify to an alibi . A possible reason was that special agents had checked up every phase of that woman 's life , occupations and environments ; Gargotta was sentenced to three years in prison and a 35000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year for perjury . Those special agents , digging always at every tiny shred of information , disbelieving everything until they had seen it proved , had doubted the honesty of that police tag . They had traced it from the day it was ordered to the day it was made , back in Massachusetts . They had the order blanks , the work sheets , shipping receipts and the men who could testify that it had not reached the Kansas City police department until two and a half months after the murder ! Detection Up  --  to  --  Date S 0 , ALL in all , four men have died as the result of those stolen Army automatics . Two have been sentenced . Three more have been indicted . All this while eight guns of the original seventy-five were being recovered . One wonders what the score will be when there is a complete accounting on the remaining sixty-seven . Yet , with all the ramifications of this Kansas City case , the resources of the Division of Investigation were not even scratched . There is hardly a legitimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is not practiced by this governmental agency , as much for local law-enforcement bodies as for itself . For instance , the body of a Negro child was found in two houses . Then the sheriff fired twice at the approaching automobile and saw two men fall , the car Sloughing to a crazy stop . Bash pointed his riot gun at the remaining assailant , who dropped his automatic , the last bullet gone from its clip . He raised his hands , pleading : " Do n't shoot ! Do n't shoot ! I 'm it friend of Johnny Lazia ! " That did not influence the sheriff . With the aid of his deputy , he handcuffed the man , picked up the gun and made mental notes by which he could identify it . This gun was named by a local ballistician as the murder weapon . Haw a Perjurer Was Tagged V OW the Federal men entered the case . Three of the guns which had been used in this murder were U. S. Army automatics , stolen from the Kansas City , Kansas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles Gargotta , the captured man , another at his feet and the third picked up between two houses by Leonard L. Claiborne , a Kansas City detective . However , there was seemingly little to do about it . Dead at the wheel of the gangster car was Sam Scola , Whom the underworld had named as the dispenser of the stolen guns . And Gargotta , the possessor of the other two , faced a state charge of murdering one Ferris Anthon , a gangster rival ; a far more serious offense than illegally possessing Government property . Further , during the time in which Gargotta awaited trial , special agents gained evidence pointing to a man known only as " Dogi " as the actual robber . Again a trail started : What was Dogi 's description ? Where did he hang out ? Who were his friends , his relatives ? What were his habits ? The chase led to the Missouri State Penitentiary , where John Mike Kobe , alias Doe , was serving a sentence for a robbery subsequent to that at the armory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the gun-stealing charge when his present term was done . Thus , a man had been charged with the robbery , and the fence established as dead . Here most criminal chasers would call their job finished . The Division of Investigation , however , does not readily close eases . It remains poised , waiting , its Where Pretty Boy Floyd Was Shot .

Gargotta went on trial in the state courts for murder . There was evidence of tremendous pressure mysteriously exerted to bring freedom . A woman testified that Gargotta was n't at the scene of the murder , but in her room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stand , presumably as a state witness , only to give startling evidence for the defense . There 'd been a mistake in the handling of the murder gun , he said . The real death weapon was the one he had found between the houses , and here was the tag which he had made out for it , but had failed to place on the weapon . So Gargotta went free of the murder charge , only to find special agents awaiting him . He must answer the sewer of an Eastern city . There were evidences of murder , and no way for the local police either to proceed with identification or a concrete method of reproducing before a jury just how the child died  --  evidently by a blow from a chisel . The Division of Investigation was called upon for expert aid , resulting in the arrival of a special agent trained in what is known as moulage , or the making of plaster casts . Not only was the child 's face reproduced in color so accurately as to permit identification but the marks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit the wound . For that matter , there is being developed in the Department of Justice the most complete crime laboratory in existence . Science plays its part more increasingly in the pursuit ( Continued on Page 79 ) ' URROUNDING YEE 2US2DSCT ( Continued from page 231 of the criminal ; here , for instance , is a file containing the blue prints of every tire tread manufactured . A sheriff or police officer , following a bank robbery , needs only to photograph any possible marks in dust , mud or a wet pavement and send them to the Division of Investigation in the same manner that he would send in the fingerprints of a suspected person . Almost immediately there will be a telegraphic reply , giving the name , style and date of manufacture of this particular tire ; sure identification if an abandoned car be found anywhere in the vicinity . Or the science may take the form of a nickname , based upon the psychology that while a man may have a hundred aliases , his nickname will remain unchanged . Special agents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more thanageneraldeseription of a man , plus the fact that he was called " Cotton . " They sent the information to Washington . A science laboratory worker consulted the files wherein are tabulated the nicknames of practically every known crook in America . There , searching through such sobriquets as the Boston Jew , the Bow-Legged Kid , Cantaloupe Kate , Bobcat Lulu , Hooknose Rose , Boxcar Annie and I3oze the Drummer , he came to fifty or more " Cottons , " each denoting a. separate personality . This did not bother him at all . He proceeded to another file , which contained a corresponding number of oblong cards , dotted by figures , and each containing punch marks , each hole denoting a detail of description . He took the cards to a queer-looking machine , consisting of several drums from which jutted numerous small adjustable knobs . He set these knobs , one for sex , another for age , still another for color of eyes , of hair , still more for height , weight and general appearance . Then he put all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instantly the main numberof identifications began to drop into a bin beneath the machine , rejected by those carefully set knobs . The second bin remained empty , until at last a single card fell there , It was the one which denoted the particular Cotton wanted by special agents . Now they could look up his real name , his photograph and his fingerprints . Too Much Quinine Or to go further , the doctor of an Eastern penitentiary reported that a certain convict called often for quinine when there were Ile symptoms that he needed it , Quinine in prison can mean more than medicine . Mixed with water or saliva it becomes an excellent means of writing invisibly . The convict in question was one of those model prisoners for whom parole boards often exhibit such sympathetic concern , The warden , being a practical soul , knew that most convicts , when preparing for trouble , are model prisoners . So the next letter written by the prisoner to his dear , faithful sweetheart was intercepted and sent in to the crime laboratory . On the plainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heavy with penitence . The experts did not even read it . They the ultra-violet ray juice . There , under the peculiar greenish light , lines of white showed through the regular ink marks . They read : Say listen Girlie , if you 've been able to got hold of those guns , do n't try to slip ' em in to me without trying to grease the way first . I got a lino on a screw who may full for you slipping him seine dough . I 'll let you know more later . He failed in that promise . The next day he wont to solitary confinement , without knowing exactly why . This does not mean , of course , that those on the outside who plot with prisoners make use of ultra-violet rays to bring out the secret writings of their coplotters . Their reagents are usually heat or a weak solution of iodine ; these are used also in the crime laboratory when the ultra-violet Fails . But as a general rule , the penetrating rays bring up secret writing sharply and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same manner . Jesse R. Watkins , a stable employee , was being questioned about the murder of a fellow stableman on a Government reservation  --  a matter of Department of Justice jurisdiction . He refused to confess . " You say there was blood everywhere , " he argued . " Well , why did n't I get some on my clothes ? Everybody knows that I 've only got this one suit , Why have n't they got bloodstains on them ? " " Maybe you washed your clothes , " said a special agent . " Maybe you could prove that . " " We can , " came the answer . " Take off that coat and cap . " Under ordinary light , the clothing was spotless . But there was a different picture once the greenish-blue of ultra-violet drove down upon it . Now flaws appeared , mottles and splotches , as plain as though the blood had not been disturbed . Chemical tests followed . Watkins went to prison for life . CriminabSelence Workshops Likewise , in a local case , the crime laboratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the victim at the time of firing the fatal shot . Proof of premeditation depended upon whether the slayer had fired from a distance , or from within a few feet , A bullet fired at close range must have left powder marks . The microscope failed to reveal them . But the ultraviolet ray showed them clearly enough to permit photography . One of the main purposes of Mr. Hoover 's work in building up this crime laboratory is the hope that it will act as an impartial central agency , in the same way that the identification unit aids in the speedy identification of captured criminals . Laboratory work at the present time is in much the same position as fingerprinting before its centralization by the Government . Only a comparatively few cities and states have criminal-science workshops ; others must depend upon local experts . Mr. Hoover looks forward to the time , when there will be a steady stream of queries rolling into the crime laboratory . An illustration of its efficacy lies 80 THE SRTURDAY EVENING POST February 2 , /935 in a letter from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabric , asking for a comparative analysis . The answer was that these were identical bits of rod wool , that the microscope , plus chemical analysis , showed them to be exactly the same size , the same color , the same fibrous structure , the same grade of wool , and tinted by the same dye , which in turn had been analyzed . The reply to this report was one of thanks , accompanied by an explanation . There had been a robbery . On the window ledge of the burglarized place had been found one of these strands of wool . A suspect had been arrested , wearing a red sweater which gave evidence of having been snagged . In other days , this could have led to a prosecution full of loopholes . There are many torn red sweaters in the world . Because the threads looked alike was no proof that they actually were alike . But in this instance , through the work of the crime laboratory , which cost the sheriff only stamp and stationery to obtain , he could testify that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the suspect 's sweater , actually were alike , and in an emergency obtain the services of an impartial expert to defend his statemen ts . impartial Expert Testimony Again , in that impartiality Mr. Hoover is attempting to wipe out an age-old deficiency in American criminal procedure . There is a saying in law that too many experts testify for the side which pays them . That can not happen with the scientists of the crime laboratory  --  no one pays them but the United States Government , and it demands the truth . The job of these men is to prove the innocent innocent and the guilty guilty ; a dispassionate attitude which often guides the special agents in the field to the solution of eases otherwise muddled by circumstantial evidence . The attempted extortion from Judge Peagram illustrates this , as well as the methods used in combating the crime of sending threats by mail . In a-little more than two years since the necessary laws were passed , sixty-seven persons have been sentenced to the penitentiary for a total of 445 years , and one was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is almost the story of all  --  innocent suspects eliminated by scientifically fastening the crime upon the one really guilty .. A series of threatening letters was received by T. E. Peagram , a county judge who lived across the Mississippi line , near Memphis , Tennessee . Persons suspected were a substitute mail carrier , the sheriff of a near-by county believed to be insane , and the members of a gang of outlaws since sentenced on a - charge of stealing Government property . In addition to the extortion notes  --  they demanded sums ranging from $1000 to $18,000 ? a bomb was exploded near the judge 's home , just to inform him , as a note said , that the threats were real . One after another , samples of handwriting from suspected persons went into the crime laboratory ; one by one , the experts there insisted that they were not identical with the true extortion notes . The investigating special agents , so the experts said , should look.for person with imagination , a flair for poetry ; someone with a grievance and . a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had shown persistently in the writing , such as fulsome descriptions of the judge 's threatened death agonies , the low sweep of willows and the lonely calls of birds over his grave-to-be , the outpourings of vituperation over the failure of a bank with which the judge had been connected , and the constant use of personal pronouns . Special agents found such a man in Mark Cyirl Spencer . Having made a beginning , the slow job of checking every item of the man 's life , his acquaintances , friends and associates began . Meanwhile they obtained samples of his penmanship and got writing material from his house . The checking process showed that he held a grudge against Judge Pea-gram . The crime laboratory established the writing to be identical ; the paper and envelopes matched those taken from his house . All white paper looks alike to the ordinary eye . It would seem that all paper of standard measurements , granted that it comes from the same manufacturer , should he alike . The reverse is true . The story of paper , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never-ending variations . There one can find samples of every sort manufactured . Every watermark is on file , first for identification , secondly for the establishment . of contested dates . Crooks often age documents in an attempt to defraud . It is only necessary to place these under the ultra-violet ray , study the watermark and go to the files . Often it will be discovered that the watermark shown in the questioned document was not in existence at the time this letter or contract was supposed to have been written . Or there may have been slight changes in style since that time  --  the files will reveal that also . In the Peagram case , however , it was a matter of similarity , size and weight . The ultra-violet rays testified to the identical texture . Then came the measurements . Due to the setting of . cutting knives by different persons at different times , jobs of paper vary from several thousandths to several hundredths of an inch . The same applies to weight . Thus the letters of Mark Cyirl Spencer were matched against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighed 4.8281 grams . The letter from Spencer 's home weighed 4.7669 grams , a difference of .0612 grams . Different ? Not at all . The extortion letter contained a stamp which weighed .0573 grams , still leaving a difference of .0039 grams . A fragment had been torn away in opening the letter . There was penciled writing , plus a postal cancellation . These made up the remaining deficiency . The envelopes were the same . The Scales of Justice The extortion paper was 7.07 by 10.46 inches . So was the paper taken from Spencer 's home . Both were .00501 inches thick . The ultra-violet ray showed the same texture . The weight of a clean sheet was 5.0975 grams , of a written one , 5.2239 grams . So the extortion note was written upon the clean sheet with the same grade of graphite pencil , and tho difference of .1264 grams eliminated . Mark Cyirl Spencer contended innocence until the day of the trial . Then faced by investigative and scientific evidence , he pleaded guilty and took a twenty-year term in prison . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impartiality in the field , impartiality in the identification and scientific units . The first training that a Division of Investigation agent receives is not to chase men but to chase facts . Mr. Hoover makes this the subject of endless lectures to his agents  --  an attitude concurred in by his superior , Homer S. Cummings , Attorney General of the United States . In fact , it was Mr. Cummings who gave to law annals a historic instance of this kind . He was state 's attorney for Fairfield County , Connecticut . A man named Harold Threat had been charged with murder ; the evidence was circumstantial , strengthened , however , by a confession which gave evidences of being an imaginative recital caused by hysteria . Mr. Cummings turned the murder bullet and Isreal 's gun over to six experts . Then , with their findings , he went into court and asked the dismissal of the charges . The comparison of the murder bullet with those fired by Isreal 's pistol showed no similarity . That same question comes up a dozen times a month in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are fired into a box of cotton . Recovered , they are put under what is known as a comparison microscope , which reacts greatly like the old stereopticon glasses , in that two objects are brought into the same line of vision . Then the Bullets are slowly turned , one after another , to match them for the inevitable fingerprinting which a rifle barrel leaves upon a projectile . If they match , it is possible to make photographs which show the markings of one bullet blending into the marks of the other ; twins of lead which can not be mistaken . Incidentally , the Division of Investigation chases the facts about guns as hard as it chases the facts about then , to learn whence they came , where they went , who had them , who sold them . Particularly is this true of Government pistols stolen from arsenals , and the machine guns which reach gangdom by diversion from legitimate sources . It might be enlightening to crooked dealers , who believe themselves safe when they file the numbers off a " hot " gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the exercise . The number still remains , awaiting work by a ballistics expert . Many of the numbers were abraded from the Army guns involved in the Kansas City , Kansas , robbery . But every time a special agent finds one , he 'll be able to identify it . Sometimes it leads to chases which encompass a great part of the country , and always to wholesome results . A machine gun was left behind during the flight of a Midwest gangster . The numbers had been removed by placing the gun against an emery wheel and cutting deeply into the steel . Nevertheless , the special ? agents began the methodical checking that was to lead half around the nation . That method of spreading out is one thing which makes the Division of Investigation different from any other law-enforcement agency . This case began in St. Paul , Minnesota . The special agent wrote his report , at the end of which the Washington supervisor typed : Undeveloped Leads : Washington will restore numbers on machine-gun barrel . Washington did this by immersing the gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep . Hour after hour passed , with no results . Finally , at the end of a half a day , there were the numbers almost as clear as the day they were stamped . The explanation is comparatively simple . The blow by which the numbers are cut into steel breaks up the molecules to a surprising depth ; to a certain degree it changes the temper of the metal in that portion of the gun . The numbers are in reality stamped entirely through the steel , instead of only on the visible portion . The application of acid , or , in some instances , heat , restores this temper , and of necessity brings out the latent markings which , until this time , have been invisible . So Washington , having finished its work , wrote a report which became a part of the one from St. Paul , the supervisor adding undeveloped leads as revealed by the restoration of the gun numbers . The Six  --  Hundred , Mlle Trail Now a special agent in another part of the country checked the records of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine guns for legitimate purposes to a Texas city . Again was there an undeveloped lead : Why had this gun , sold legitimately , reached a criminal ? A Texas special agent took up the hunt . The legitimate source revealed that all fourteen guns had been stolen . Now the undeveloped leads went back to St. Paul , and required that the movements of every member of the outlaw crew be traced back through the time of the theft of these machine guns . This brought out other undeveloped leads in a dozen cities , where questioning established the presence of this particular gang of criminals at various times . Every gun shop was investigated . Finally , in a place some six hundred miles from the point of theft , where one of this gang had committed a murder , an unlicensed gun dealer was apprehended . It was established that he had handled five of these fourteen machine guns , selling them to the gang in question . Thus , by passing a case along from city to city , special agent to special agent , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that led not only to the source of crime guns but to prosecution . The chasing of facts also applies to the modus operandi files now being built up for major crimes , wherein are listed the quirks of criminals . For instance , in the kidnaping of Charles Boettcher II in Denver , Colorado , certain characteristics stood out . Boettcher was held up at his garage door , then walked to a small dark sedan , where his eyes were bound with adhesive tape . As the kidnapers drove away , they handed Mrs. Boettcher a note . In captivity , the victim was forced to write letters pleading with relatives not to notify the police and to pay the ransom . The money was to he brought out on an open road , in a car running about thirty miles an hour and traveling the road at a certain time . It was to keep going until a signal was received from a parked car . Then the money was to be tossed out and the ransom automobile was to continue on its way . Special agents checked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kidnapers of not one man but two . For this modus operandi showed by its similarity of characteristics that the same gang also had been the kidnapers of Haskell Bohn , in St. Paul , Minnesota . More definitely the point was proved when Verne Sankey and several others were arrested . Sankey committed suicide ; his conspirators were convicted . Even beyond these files are others , a centralized flare-back to the old methods of the rogue 's gallery , now efficient because they can be bulwarked by fingerprint files , modus operandi , investigation and science . This is the general-appearance section . The First National Bank , of Marlton , New Jersey , was robbed by a quartet of holdup men . Three of the alleged robbers were known , and captured . The fourth got away and could not be identified . Blocked , the local officers sent his general description to Washington . Again mysterious-appearing cards with their multiplicity of punch marks came forth to be run through the machine  --  some 400 of a total of 8000 known bank robbers and big-time crooks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-nine . The technical expert then went to a photograph file where no names appear , only pictures and numbers . He picked the twenty-nine photographs which matched the numerals of the cards selected by the machine . These were sent to New Jersey . One was identified as the missing robber . The efficacy of the system was shown when the number of the photograph was checked against the name and address . He was a gangster living in the near-by city of Philadelphia . Nor was he waiting there to protest his innocence . Even gangsters these days know when to run . But in running , that gangster must observe one inviolable rule . He must not make a single mistake that will bring him into the hands of police anywhere in the United States . For then his fingerprints will be taken and forwarded to Washington , where , in the identification unit , there awaits a pink ' 506 , slip , clipped to his Cr2osei fingerprint file . It bears only one word ; " WANTED ! "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
