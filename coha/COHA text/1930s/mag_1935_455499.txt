SHORTLY after I had begun to serve my turn as a publisher 's apprentice I suffered the unavoidable experience of falling in love . It soon became clear that , whatever the young lady might think , her elders regarded me as unnecessarily risky . This was not because I was a two-bottle man or fond of stepping out late with the chorus ; no , so far as I could tell , their suspicions centred chiefly on the fact that I had committed myself to a bookish career . In an effort to save me before I had sunk too deep in the literary quicksands , one of the elders admonished me in this fashion . ' Do n't you think you 're making a mistake , ' he said , ' to go into publishing ? A serious mistake . People do n't have time to read books to-day : they 're too busy with other things . Motors , dancing , moving pictures , the radio , golf ? they 'll put books out of business . Twenty-five years from now you 'll find yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doomed . ' I cite this somewhat private conversation ? which , incidentally , took place a dozen years ago ? not with any sense of personal vindication , but because it represents such a drear and philistine estimate of literature . There doubtless are other citizens of this country , other guardians of eligible princesses , who hold the same opinion . In that opinion are equal portions of truth and fallacy . My well-wisher first said that people no longer have time for books ? a remark which may apply to New Yorkers with plenty of money to spend , but not to those who are unemployed and impecunious . He put books in the class with other luxuries , which was quite right . He prophesied that reading would show a steady decline , a statement debatable and probably wrong . Finally , he inferred that those who derive their living from books will never be rich . What , never ! Well , hardly ever . But of course it needs a provocation such as this to open one 's eyes .

An incurable optimist , I do n't believe that books are doomed . But having counseled authors , edited manuscripts , and studied the public in fat years and in lean , I should be myopic if I did not see some means of improving the market for books , authors , and readers to-day . To look hack on the American literature produced in the decade 1919-1929 is to recall , at first glance , the vigor and variety of the more notable publications : Main Street , Babbitt , and Arrowsmith by Sinclair Lewis , Jahn deleted material read the volume cited . But , unhappily for veracity , there was no standard measurement of what constituted a printing ' or an ' impression .

The publishers knew among themselves which figures were telling the honest story . But did the public ? Let us say that your eye has been caught by an advertisement stating in boldface type that Smothered Lovers is now ' in its 97th thousand . " Wow , ' you say , ' I guess I 'll have to read that novel if I am not to be left behind . ' The panic appeal . But the truth might show that when that advertisement was actually written the sale was approaching seventy thousand . Reorders were coming in fast enough to warn the publisher that he had better lay in paper for his future editions . He orders paper to carry him up to the 37th thousand and promptly coins the slogan , ' Now in its 97111. thousand . ' Is this dealing in futurities ? Finally , for those not content with the trade editions , for those who wished to acquire ( without effort ) a reputation as a collector , the publishers revived a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Now the pursuit of legitimate first editions and the acquisition of association copies are both perfectly healthy pastimes . I mean by an ' association copy ' a volume , generally of the first edition , which has been inscribed by the author and presented to you in all friendliness . I have a few such . They constitute , indeed , one of the few assets I shall probably be able to leave my heirs . But an author 's circle of acquaintance is apt to be a small one . In order to give the amateur collectors a better chance publishers did two things . First , they sent their booming authors on a tour of our largest department stores ; there the authors were placed on exhibition and signed copies of their books as fast as the money hit the counter . Secondly , they began to issue costly but limited editions of their more salient new books . Certain authors ? James Branch Cabell , for instance , is one ? lent themselves to this practice very gracefully . Just how much the limited edition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not say . But what about ' Dancing Lobsters and Five Other Tales by Niemand Zuhause with thirteen illustrations by Puvis de Puvis , printed on hand-laid Holland paper from a specially designed Rubberneck Type and limited to four hundred copies , of which this is No . ? ' ? There were a good many ninnies who paid ten dollars for those Dancing Lobsters in 1929 who might find it difficult even to give the book assay to-day . Here , then , is a thumbnail sketch of the American book trade at its best and at its worst in the platinum twenties . Came the dawn ? and a rather overcast morning it was . With panic in the air and stocks on the run , people began to keep their money in the sock . Luxuries were naturally sensitive to this parsimony . To avoid buying luxuries all you have to do is to tell yourself ( thank you , Mr. Conff ) that they are n't worth much , they are n't worth very much , they are n't worth very much anyway . By January of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Fords and Chevrolets ; they were beginning to prefer homemade gin to Booth 's , the movies to the theatre ; they were beginning to use fifty-cent golf balls instead of the dollar variety , and to buy fewer books . Sometimes when I was in the coinparry of candid friends I would hear a protestation such as this : ' I know you wo n't like us to say so , but we 've simply got to cut down on our books . They ' re expensive ; only one in ten is really worth keeping , and the rest just clutter up the apartment . ' That was the handwriting on the wall . As might be expected , the inflated values were quick to wilt : those limited editions of perishable authors , on sale at handsome prices at Christmas of 1929 , were being marked down or exchanged the year following . But publishers were not losing sleep over this side line . They were wondering what was to happen to their more dependable assets , the better novels and biographies , the books of academic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past . A good merchant anticipates the tide , and , once the depression set in , it was no news to publishers that book prices would have to come down . The problem presented itself simply as one of manufacturing costs ; the Code had not yet begun to police the premises . Printers and binders were prevailed on ( with an axe ) to accept lower terms ; the purchase of the different grades of paper was conducted with economy in mind ; dust jackets became less colorful , gold was used on the cover sparingly if at all , and , most important , the size of the edition was more closely calculated . But not closely enough . Publishers were still tempted to base their new printings upon the sales of the preceding year . But the system will not work when you are slipping downhill . Publishers knew that the book trade could no longer absorb 2000 copies of almost any first novel ; they knew more as their sales cards began to show them that this book on modern art had sold exactly 623 copies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of French travel letters had staggered on to 1130 copies and then quit . Ingenuity was called in to combat these red figures : books designed for a limited audience were printed from movable type ( at a saving roughly of about $200 an edition ) and English books were reproduced for American readers by the photo-offset process ? that is to say , by the collaboration of camera and printing press . By saving a penny here and three cents there , prices came down to new levels . Three-decker novels , instead of being published in parts , were sewn up between single covers . I attribute a measure of the success that came to Anthony Adverse to the singular skill with which that omnibus was manufactured . When a household found it could buy several months ' good romance for as little as $3.00 , it did n't begrudge the money . But Anthony was and is a white whale . In their zeal to cut corners , some publishers created a distinctly false impression along Main Street . The cry of ' paper books ' was revived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This experiment is not a new one ; it has been tried out in this country at various times and never with sustained success . The economic difference between a book bound in paper and one bound in cloth boils down to about eight cents a copy . The publication of paperbound novelsi at the arbitrary price of $1.00 depends upon other elements than binding and can only be self-supporting when ( 1 ) labor costs have been reduced to a point comparable to those in Europe ; ( 2 ) authors have agreed to take a 50 per cent smaller royalty per copy ; ( 3 ) the public has shown its willingness to eat up a minimum printing of 5000 copies of every book so published . This the American readers have steadfastly refused to do . Nor did hard times in the early thirties change their mind . Their qwq the depression , by the time we all come to live on a four-day week our reading will really amount to something . III It is by now permissible to consider the author . Popular romance to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Industrially , American authors can be sorted into one of two guilds : those who depend upon the magazine industry for the major part of their livelihood , and those who ( with private means or uncompromising courage ) take the longer risk of committing themselves to the six months ' , the ten months ' , the eighteen months ' toil of writing a book . I am speaking primarily of authors ? not dramatists , radio performers , or rewrite men for Hollywood . In prosperous years both guilds enjoyed considerable revenue from their royalties and from the byproducts of their industry ? film rights sold to Hollywood , dramatic rights to a producer , serial rights to periodicals and syndicates . But it was a very different story when the depression closed down upon motion pictures , theatrical production , and magazine circulation . In normal times the financial status of our authors admits of three levels . At the top are a small group of what I might call literary magnates ? E. Phillips Oppenheim , Zane Grey , Mary Roberts Rinehart , Willa Cather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bailey ? each one of whom in full production might earn in the neighborhood of $70,000 a year . A fellow publisher , Thomas R. Coward , 2 has made a composite picture of the income of a popular novelist whose new book has just sold 50,000 copies and who is eager to pursue every offer . Before you read these figures , let me caution you that mighty few moguls are capable of this earning power and still fewer of them can maintain it for long . I doubt if in any year as much as one per cent of the writing profession is capable of reaching this maximum figure . In 1934 there were exactly fifteen authors whose books sold 50,000 copies or more in the United States . On the plane next below will be found a group of well-known novelists and short-story writers , authors of the best technical books and the standard juveniles , and a few exceptional biographers who with utmost industry are able to average an earned income of between $10,000 and $15,000 a year . They comprise perhaps 12 per cent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our army of writers are to be found on the third and lowest plane . To put it generously , the annual proceeds of their writing range somewhere between $800 and $5000 . The Authors Guild puts their average earning in good times at $2500 a year . Since many of them are people of maturity with families to support , it goes without saying that the members of this third estate must depend either upon private incomes or part-time jobs if their bills are to be met . For them literature is a poor staff and a not altogether reliable crutch . The pinch of hard times was of course felt on each of these levels . The shrinkage of advertising and circulation compelled magazine editors to economize . That is to say , they reduced the size of their publications , they printed material they had paid for but never used ; they bought , in short , about half as much new material as they had needed in the happy days . Magazine writers who had been living in assumed security suddenly realized that their markets were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made they were likely to receive a price smaller by 50 per cent than what they had been accustomed to . Meanwhile the book writers were facing their own particular grief . Readers , as I have said , were losing the habit of buying the many books they wanted ; they had suddenly become price-conscious . They bought only the irresistible books ; the others were borrowed from the public libraries or rented from the circulating libraries in the bookstores . The royalties of even the best-established writers came down on the toboggan ; the royalties of authors whose books customarily sold over 10,000 copies suddenly dropped 50 per cent below the 1929 return . The royalties of unestablished writers , by which I mean first novelists , young poets , beginning biographers , dwindled to the vanishing point . ' Fewer and Better Books ' was an ideal rule to enforce if booksellers and publishers were to survive . But , reduced to financial terms , it meant that mature authors had to tighten their belts and beginning authors had to surmount a higher wall than heretofore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should . Families accustomed to buy twenty books on an income of $10,000 a year cut themselves down to six volumes when their income was reduced by half . A survey of 100 families of Ford employees , with incomes averaging $1711.87 , showed that these households were spending 20 cents a year for their books , other than schoolbooks . Encouraged by economy , a mushroom growth of circulating libraries sprang up throughout the United States , not only in bookstores but in drug stores , fruit stands , news stands , stationery shops , private homes , even in comfort stations . Their number is legion . Their effect upon publisher and author has never been accurately estimated . In 1928 the circulating libraries then in operation were said to have absorbed about 15 per cent of the fiction published in the United States ; to-day they absorb close to 40 per cent . ( The percentage varies from 15 per cent to 75 per cent , depending upon the nature of the novel ; an average of 40 per cent would seem to be a fair guess . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly than on our side of the water , they are said to absorb close to 80 per cent of the current novels . I should perhaps explain what I mean by absorb . " The circulating library in the Old Corner Book Store of Boston is operated with remarkable efficiency . The books placed in that library are expected to ? and do ? maintain an average of twenty rentals per volume . That is to say , twenty households ? or perhaps thirty different people ? read each book in that library before the copy is finally sold or withdrawn . Thirty readers have taken their turn with a new novel . The fees which they paid for their enjoyment were collected by the bookstore . But the author 's reward for his share in the business was simply the royalty on the single copy sold to the circulating library . If the book was originally priced at $2.00 , his average royalty amounted to 24 cents . In other words , thirty people read this one copy of his book , said Thank you very much , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extend this illustration to cover the country . The novel we are speaking of achieves , let us say , a total sale of 15,000 copies ? a much better than average performance . If my suspicions are justified , 40 per cent of this figure ? or 6000 copies ? will pass into the circulating libraries . Presuming that the libraries maintain their average rental , these 6000 copies will be rented by 120,000 patrons ; they will probably be read by a good many more , yet in the end all that the author has to show for this loaned entertainment is the meagre sum of $1440 ( $1800 if he has a reputation ) ? his royalty on the 6000 copies sold to the libraries . If that 's not unfair I 'll eat my hat . Whether a book rents twenty times , whether it goes into fifty-two households , as was the case with Dr. Harvey Cushing 's Life of Osier , which I happened to sample from the Old Corner shelves , whether it is rented ( and half-read ? ) by the multitude who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injustice remains virtually the same . The royalty contract between author and publisher , the percentage of profits which a writer is entitled to , has altered very little since the copyright law was invoked to enforce honest dealing . It was assumed by both parties that copies of a book distributed through the normal commercial channels would be read by no more than two , three , or four people , and when you remember the number of unread books in your own private library , you will realize that this was not an unfair assumption . Not , that is , until the circulating libraries threw things out of kilter . ' Well , ' your answering argument may be , ' if more people are reading each copy of a printed book to-day , there is only one thing to do . Raise the price . ' And that leads me to consider the cost of a book . IV Sherlock Holmes , Dr. Watson , and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle between them have been responsible for popularizing that great pastime of the twentieth century , the reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and some who are not ) find more relaxing than cards or alcohol . But once the killer has been identified , once Gwendolyn 's innocence has been proved and the guileful villain hand .. cuffed , the detective story becomes just another book , one to be loaned , given away , or returned to the library as rapidly as possible . ' Why , ' demands the constant critic , ' charge two dollars for a book no one wants to keep ? Surely you can make it for less . ' But can we ? The two-dollar price is today affixed to detective novels , Western novels , to the ' hot ' romances that swarm in cheap circulating libraries , to most first novels , and to short books by established authors . By way of answering the critic , I should like to exhibit a manufacturing sheet which has been compiled with very strict attention to averages and which seeks to identify the chief expenses in printing 2500 copies of a two-dollar novel whose text runs to not more than 320 pages . In short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : that after the publisher has paid the bookseller his commission for selling the book , paid the author his royalty , paid for the manufacturing of the finished product , and for its advertising , he has a remainder of 22 cents with which to meet his overhead charges . ' Overhead , ' I realize , is one of those lovely vague words which business men use to impress their wives . The bookseller 's discount ' will be eaten into by the overhead ' ? the operation ? of his shop . The author 's royalty is no clear profit , for out of it he has got to pay the ' overhead ' ? the expenses ? of writing that is to say , the fee of a typist or secretary , the purchase of books or source material , and the rent of his workshop . In this instance a publisher 's overhead consists of the following items : his and his associates ' salaries , office rent , taxes , traveling and selling expenses , warehouse and shipping expenses , unearned advances to authors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to charge off to overhead 28 per cent of a publisher 's net receipts . If this be done in the instance of a two-dollar novel which has sold 2500 copies and no more , it will be seen that the publisher has sustained a paper if not an actual loss of 10 cents a copy . In actuality a novel with such a small sale as this not only does not show a profit ; it can not even pay its rightful share of the publisher 's expenses . Its financial failure has to be balanced by the success of the best seller on the list ? if there is one . These figures may explain to you why the new book of a well-known novelist ? why , in other words , the novel which can depend on a loyal audience ? is usually priced at $2.50 . Understand , please , that the author , the bookseller , and the publisher take their proportionate percentage of this increased price . These books can not be allowed to appear stillborn ; they have to be pushed , their promotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his share of that extra 50 cents if his advertising is to sell the book and please the author . These books are the breadwinners of the entire list ; such profit as they may allow must offset the losses incurred by those less known and neglected volumes which a publisher honestly seeking for new talent must hazard . ' Fewer and Better Books ' ? yes , but not to the total exclusion of the promising aspirant . How many books of Conrad 's do you suppose proved themselves failures before the public learned to respect his genius ? The first three . Tit the face of this equation a full-length new novel can not fairly be priced below $2.00 .. Yet your own experience will tell you that considerable reductions have been made in the price of the more expensive volumes . A new biography with half-tones , maps , gilt top , and good binding ( Douglas Southall Freeman 's B. E. Lee , for instance ) , which would have sold for $5.00 in 1020 , to-day can be had for $3.75 a volume . Books of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been stepped down from $5.00 to $4.00 and under . This is good psychology , for a $3.50 price still leaves a substantial portion of a five-dollar bill in one 's pocket , whereas anything over $4.00 reduces the matter to quicksilver . This economy in the field of nonfiction is the more remarkable if you will bear in mind that , according to statistics obtained in 1011 ( before publishers were properly cautious ) , in the first year of publication four out of every ten books of nonfiction sell less than 1000 copies ; four sell over 1500 ; three sell over 2000 ; two sell over 3000 ; and one lone volume sells over 6000 . If , therefore , you as a consumer will agree that book prices can not be measurably reduced below their present level , I as a producer will give my word that they will not be measurably increased despite the upward pressure of the printing Code . My promise will be no good if we have Inflation . But , if economy precludes our raising the price of a book for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author his rightful share of those retail fees which the circulating libraries are reaping in these lean years ? The circulating libraries argue that they must maintain an average of twenty rentals a book if that branch of their business is to operate profitably . This sounds to me rather high . Suppose we reduce the average to fifteen ? Now if one admits the principle that an author should be reimbursed by each reader for the pleasure his book affords , would it not be just to ask that the circulating libraries divide with the author and publisher the rental fees ? in other words , the excess profits which they take in after the first fifteen borrowers have been accounted for ? This would seem to me the ideal division . But I recognize that it would call for elaborate bookkeeping and would of course be difficult to enforce . So I turn to a simpler solution . Let us say that the Old Corner Book Store of Boston buys twenty-five copies of a new novel by Edward Weeks . Fifteen of these copies will be reserved for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are lucky , the public will plunk down $2.00 for each copy . But ten copies are to be placed in the circulating library ; and these the bookstore is obligated to purchase from my publisher at $2.50 each ? that is to say , at the increased premium of 50 cents a copy . A sticker ? a license , if you like ? is placed inconspicuously on the inside cover of the book , authorizing the inclusion of the book in the circulating library at the premium price . This extra pre- mium of 50 cents is paid to the publisher , and half of it helps to increase my royalty account . The remainder goes into the publisher 's treasury to offset , you might say , the loss of sales indirectly attributable to the lending of books . This licensing of books was first experimented with in Denmark , and I am indebted to the Danish author , Peter Freuchen , for an accurate account of the crusade which he led , not against the circulating libraries as we know them , but against the public libraries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his enlightened country . Here , in the words of Mr. Freuchen , is what happened : Our sales went down , and in a number of cases , when we checked , we found that people now got in the habit of borrowing books who used to buy them . That was why in a meeting of Danish authors , set forth my plan to make the libraries pay something to us . The authors did not think it possible , but I had printed in my next book , The Sea Tyrant : ' This book may not be lent out in libraries without the permission of the publisher . ' By mutual understanding a librarian did , and I used him . I won in the first court , and he brought it to the Supreme Court of Denmark . I also won my case there . Thus it was proved that the lending of books can be prohibited in Denmark . We then arranged it in the following manner : The libraries that buy books have to buy licenses , too , to lend the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark from the publisher ( a sort of stamp ) which must be glued in the book on the inside of the book cover . The price of that license mark was equal to the retail price of the book . The money thus collected was to be divided between the author and the publisher . Mr. Freuchen , you see , was intent on doubling the price of his book . But this , I am afraid , would be more of a tax than our circulating libraries could afford . Unhappily for authors , his little revolution then petered out . I was very much applauded by the authors when I won the case . But that was all . We have a socialistic government , but as soon as the authors , for the first time , started a trade-union movement , the government jumped on us . It was said to those of them that had pensions from the state that this pension would be taken away from them if they would not permit the libraries to lend out their books free . That stopped lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not throw overboard the state 's money , which provides their house rent . Result was that the whole movement fell to pieces . I am still the only author in Denmark that has that remark printed in my book . I do n't want to involve our public libraries in this adjustment . They perform a public service , they receive a much smaller discount than the bookseller , and they are particularly valuable in giving continued life to old books . But circulating libraries which make hay while the sun shines on our brand-new books should , I firmly believe , share a portion of their excess profits with the author and his publisher . There are said to be between forty and fifty thousand circulating libraries now operating in the United States . In England , where the movement is as wildfire , I am told that in addition to the five big chains of Smith 's , Boot 's , Mudie 's , Times , and Harrod 's there are seven thousand circulating libraries which no longer require even a deposit . You are simply loaned any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include the best ) at tuppence a week . Let us be candid these agencies ? which have certainly come to stay ? are a mixed blessing . In affording new outlets for books and in attracting new readers the country over , they arc a positive asset . Over 50 per cent of our rural population have no ready access to bookstores to-day . As a new depart- men t in the general store , the circulating libraries will help to stimulate reading in the far corners . Admittedly they obstruct the purchase of books and in so doing have appropriated to themselves an undeserved share of the author 's potential earnings . This financial maladjustment will have to be corrected if our book writers are to be self-supporting . Finally , by stimulating the publication of what the trade terms ' lending-library tripe , ' by stimulating the distribution of silly , warm ' romances , ? you know the titles : Hot Flesh , Bed and Bored , Two Girls in to Studio , ? they have definitely helped to cheapen the production of books in this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very little interest in fewer and better books by the best talent we can produce . They demand quite candidly those amatory novels having what they call box-office appeal . ' To meet that demand some of our smaller publishers are now bending their entire energy . I must emphasize this cheapening influence of the inferior circulating libraries when as a publisher I am asked to believe that these new agencies are outlets for good books the country over . You have by now argued me into the mood of a reformer . And the world is never as black as a reformer would have you believe . The depression in the book trade reached its low tide in the summer of 1933 , and since then the current has turned in a more heartening direction . American readers purchased 10 per cent more books in 1934 than they did the previous twelvemonth , and very glad we editors were to hear it . But a housecleaning is not really efficacious unless it affects all the inmates . If American readers are again acquiring the habit of buying books , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
