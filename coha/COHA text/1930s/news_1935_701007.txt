txt Limiting ' Liquidation ' Sales . To the Editor of The New York Times : Could not those stores displaying signs leading the public to believe that they are " closing out , " " retiring from business , " offering " special discounts , " " auctioning everything , " &c.,; and which maintain this form of selling indefinitely , be ruled out by a simple ordinance that once such a sign was displayed , the owner must actually close out his stock and otherwise terminate his " sale " within a specified time , or be subject to a severe penalty ? His competitors , who lose business because the public is led by these misleading signs to believe they will get bargains in such stores , would be only too glad to check up on his time limit and see that he lived up to his public announcement . With business striving so hard to recover on the basis of live and let live , it seems to me that such sales are a definite check to any restoration of buying confidence .
