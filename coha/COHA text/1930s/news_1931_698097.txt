Oil Waste Definition ' Unclear Nprt.nt 10 TITS WALL SrSEST ** AUSTIN  --  Opinion of petroleum engineers and oil producers differs so widely as to what constitutes physical waste in the East Texas oil field that the Railroad Commission admits that it is going to be difficult to conform strictly to the provisions of the new oil and gas conservation law . When the Railroad Commission meets today to consider the allowable to be fixed for that field the views of men of the industry will be invited Some operators , especially a group of independents . contend that with the present number of wells more than 1,000 000 barrels of oil daily can be produced without violating any provision of the new law . whereas the East Texas Advisory Committee and the Central Proration Committee are said to fare , a daily allowable for the area of not to exceed 250,000 barrels Other oil interests contend that the maximum should be fixed at 300.000 to 350,000 barrels daily The new law prohibits the commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic phase of the industry in fixing allowable ! , but should it make the figures too high a slump in the price would quickly follow , producers assert .
