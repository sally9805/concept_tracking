In studying the behavior of complex electrical systems , it is frequently desirable to solve algebraic equations of the seventh or eighth degree-that is , equations containing terms raised to the seventh or eighth power . It is impossible to obtain formal , exact solutions of equations higher than the fourth degree . Approximate numerical solutions of equations of the fifth degree and up can be arrived at by laborious trial &; error , trying one value , then another , and so on until a value is found which approximately fits the mathematical statement . <P> Described last week in the Franklin Institute 's Journal was an electrical robot which , taking advantage of the differences between voltage phases , performs this trial &; error in a few minutes instead of hours or days . Designed by Engineer Harry C. Hart and others of the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania , it is a complex but small and neat layout of generators with movable stators , potentiometers , gears , cams , rectifiers , amplifiers , etc . Reduced to simplest terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set to correspond to the coefficients of the equations to be solved . A second series is geared together in the ratio of squares , cubes and higher powers . All the roots of an eighth-degree equation can be obtained in a half hour with a limit of error not greater than one or two per cent .
