Crouching , howling , blind-running , wall-climbing are symptoms of running fits , or fright disease in dogs . Although fits , unlike rabies ( a deadly virus disease ) , can not be transmitted from dogs to human beings , the convulsions are so alarmingly violent that more than 100,000 innocent dogs with fits are destroyed every year . Last week in Veterinary Medicine , scholarly Dr. John W. Patton of East Lansing , Mich , published an illuminating report on the cause &; cure of fits . <P> Several months ago , said Dr. Patton , a worried dog owner consulted him about the howling and staggering of his sturdy , thoroughbred dogs . Dr. Patton found that ten days before , the owner had taken his dogs off a special diet rich in vitamin B1 ( found in whole cereals , meat , milk and eggs ) . He now fed them nothing but starchy dog food . When Dr. Patton gave the dogs meat and a well-balanced dog-food diet again , they made " a rapid and prompt recovery . " <P> Since dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rickets and pellagra just like human beings , Dr. Patton believed that he had discovered the canine equivalent of beriberi ( vitamin B1 deficiency disease ) . To test his belief he took 13 healthy puppies from his own kennels , fed them nothing but water and heavy dog food mixed with all the vitamins but B1 . Within a week the dogs shunned the food , lost weight . They avoided light , trembled and cringed when patted , climbed walls , fell backward , howled constantly . When offered food , they fell forward into their pans . <P> After these symptoms had developed , Dr. Patton gave each of the sick dogs a small injection of pure vitamin B1 " The effect , " he reported , " was . . . spectacular . The injection transformed a racing , howling maniac , or one in appalling convulsions , frothing at the mouth and screeching piteously , into a quiet though nervous animal within four hours , and in 48 hours into a normal , healthy , playful puppy . " <P> Canine beriberi , concluded Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the years immediately following the War . . . when scraps suitable for dog food largely disappeared from the . . . dining-room table , and urban dog owners turned to commercial foods for the sustenance of their pets . ... " If owners do not feed their dogs meat , said Dr. Patton , to avoid fits they should make sure that the commercial food they use contains vitamin B1.
