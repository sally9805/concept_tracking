Swarthy servants shined up gleaming swords one night last week in Mexico City , next morning laid out the heavily gold-braided uniforms of army commanders of Mexico 's military districts . These satraps had been summoned by General Lazaro Cardenas , expropriating President of Mexico , to back him visibly with their presence when he opened the Mexican Congress last week . As is their jealously guarded privilege , the Congressmen each wore a pistol . General Cardenas was in mufti , for he is the " New Deal " hero of underprivileged Mexicans . All Mexico was tense with anticipation , for New Dealer Cardenas had announced that he would read " the most important message to Congress delivered since my inauguration . " <P> In the eyes of Mexicans , their popular President had just been figuratively flashed a green light by Washington to go ahead with his seizure of foreign properties in Mexico without compensation . Every Mexican remembers the red light which President Woodrow Wilson had flashed on April 21 , 1914 from the fighting top of the U. S. S. Arkansas . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels and within a few months unacceptable President Huerta was forced to resign . <P> Last week 's figurative green light was flashed by Josephus Daniels , now U. S. Ambassador to Mexico and an admiring friend of New Dealer Cardenas . The envoy of an unnamed third State called on Ambassador Daniels , warned him that President Cardenas was almost sure to make a speech rejecting the note in which Secretary Hull recently demanded immediate compensation for the seized properties , and offered to join the U. S. Ambassador in snubbing Orator Cardenas by staying away from his speech . Mr. Daniels refused this offer , genially let it be known that , since he understands hardly a word of Spanish , he would n't know what President Cardenas was saying anyhow , and turned up beaming in the diplomatic box . <P> Although Lazaro Cardenas is a poor , mumbling speaker without Latin fire or grace , the General brought Mexico 's pistol-toting Congressmen to their feet shouting " Viva ! " again &; again last week . They saw at once that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Hull had laid down in diplomatic terms that it is a violation of international law for Mexico to expropriate without immediate compensation . General Cardenas laid down in non-diplomatic terms that what Mexico has done is " for the greatest good of the greatest number of people , " and said that in international law there is no such principle as was cited by the U. S. note. * The request of Mr. Hull that Mexico at least make no further seizures of property , pending arbitration , was rejected by President Cardenas and he further rejected the " principle of arbitration " in this case . <P> As a clincher , the Mexican President said he had just as much right to take the lands of the rich as other presidents ( like Neighbor Roosevelt ) have had to forbid their people to possess gold coins .
