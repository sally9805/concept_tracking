txt Balanced industrial production and prices will he easier to maintain if better inventory information is available , high Administration officials believe . First step toward government cooperation in obtaining these fig-tires came when Secretary Ickes said figures on iron and steel scrap supplies will be available soon as result of a special survey . Steel mills generally had only about xis weeks ' supply of scrap when the war broke out , it is estimated by a leading executive . He believes an advance of R5 a ton In finished steel would be necessary to offset the higher prices which mills must pay to replenish scrap stocks . Front Tu le WALL SMELT itICIZNAL Washington Ruin-au WASHINGTON  --  American industry will be better able to keep its production and prices in balance if better information regarding inventories in major lines is available , high Administration officials said yesterday . The government will cooperate with business in securing and publishing such information , they predicted . The first actual step in this direction was seen here when Secretary of Interior Ickes announced that authentic figures on iron and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a survey of dealers ' and consumers ' stocks of such materials last month . Situation Regarded as ' ' ' Ominous " As has been previously pointed out in Washington dispatches to The Wall Street Journal , New Deal economic advisers have regarded the iron and steel scrap situation as " ominous " and made known their willingness to aid steel producers to secure an adequate supply of this vital steel-making material at reasonable prices . The prevailing viewpoint in government circles is that the effect of speculative activity in major commodities can be minimized by adequate and prompt reports on the available supply . Administration economists believe that ? ' panicky " buying can thereby be prevented because it is their belief that users of important raw materials have a tendency to overstock and play into the hands of speculators . As rapidly as it proves possible to do so . officials here are in favor of compiling and publishing inventory statistics on many types of goods which are not now subject to any accurate record . Lack of information on inventories has been considered for some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies by economic experts in Washington , but the current wave of concern over the possibility of another stock-building boomlet and a serious setback late on next year has redoubled their determination to do something about it . In some quarters , Inventory reports are considered one of the most effective and noncontroversial means of assisting industry to stabilize its production and price policies . Methods Under Consideration Methods of making available such reports are under consideration by New Deal advisers working on the commodity pricesituation . Secretary Ickes stated that the recent rise in steel activity emphasized the need for careful watching of the situation in ferrous raw materials . Adequate data are available on iron ore and pig iron , he said , but little is known as to the present stocks of scrap . The need for supplying this major deficiency in facts pertaining to the iron and steel industry has been acknowledged widely by leaders in industry anc government , and the Secretary urged the patriotic cooperation of both suppliers and consumers in contributing accurate and prompt rep'ritz on their scrap position to the Bureau of Minas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director , had advised him that the survey has been indorsed by the Army and Navy Munitions Board . and that the full cooperation of the American Iron and Steel institute on behalf of the consumers and of toe Institute of Scrap Iron and Steel and the National Association of Waste Material Dealers on behalf of the dealers has been pledged . The majority of steel mills in the United States , when the European war broke out , had only about six weeks ' supply of steel scrap on hand , and thus are now producing steel with scrap purchased at the increasingly higher levels which obtained through September and early October , according to a leading steel company executive . This executive declared that , after discussion with other steel leaders , he believed it would take an acas.nce of about $5 a ton in finished steel to offset the recent increase in Mc price of scrap , pig iron and other products going into steel manufacture He also stated that examination of the relation between selling price and raw material costs now and in the act.ve year 1937 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ margin Investigation of the relative price levels and raw material costs disclosed that at present the steel makers have about $7 a ton less spread between principal raw material prices and sel. - ing prices than they had in 1937. the most recent really good steel year At present ( Iron Age averages ) . p:g iron costs $22 61 a ton and scrap $22.03. making an average raw material cost of $22 34 t asasuming 50 ' , scrap and 50. , pig iron per ton of steel ) Finished steel composite price now is abou ' $50 09. leaving a spread between raw materials and finished steel price of $29.75 . During the peak operating months of 1937 , April and May . the average of pig iron and scrap per ton was 321.51 , but selling price was $56.27 , leaving a spread of $34 76 . Thus there is almost exactly $7 difference in the margin with which steel makers now have to work as compared with 1937 . Averaging out scrap and pig iron costs and selling price for the full year 1937 gives dust about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel operaticns topped 90 " , of capacity . There has been some tendency in the steel trade to place blame on scrap dealers for the rapid rise in scrap prices which has carried tile composite level more than 56 above early August figures and brought advances of $8 or more in certain districts . A defense of the scrap dealers has been undertaken by Charles H. Lipsett. editor and publisher of the Waste Trade Journal . Mr. Lipsett in a recent article took the mills to task for a short sighted policy in regard to scrap , pointing out that when scrap at Pittsburgh was selling at around $11 a ton in June . 1 ? 33 , a price so low it hardly paid dealers to collect it , mills were to lay in a reserve , but they did not and were content to let the dealers hold the bag . " - Mr. Lipsett stated that the export of scrap , which some steel mills now are seeking to have prohibited . was all that kept many dealers in business when domestic mills would not buy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrap permitted to disintegrate , he said . Mr. Lipsett also pointed out that 17 000.000 feweitons of scrap were consumed in 1933 than in 1937. while exports in 1938 dropped to 3.000.000 tons from 4,092,000 tons in 1937 . Thus . according to Mr. Lipsett. the drop in scrap consumption could not be blamed on exports , but was in fact caused by the lack of home-produced scrap in steel mills and the smaller collection of scrap by dealers . Domestic consumption of iron and steel scrap in September totaled 3,282,000 gross tons , the largest for any month in about two years , according to the Institute of Scrap Iron &; Steel . September consumption , which includes " home " as well as purchased scrap . represented an increase of 13% over August . and 50% over September , 1938 . Government reports place exports of scrap in the first eight months of 1939 at 2,430,914 tons , against 2,014,051 tons in the comparable period of 1938 . September exports probably will show the third successive monthly decline , and indications are that the 1939 total will approximate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
