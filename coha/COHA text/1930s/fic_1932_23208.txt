FOOTNOTE TO A LIFE A STORY BY LLOYD MORRIS W HEN after dinner they returned to the library for coffee , Philip Leighton remarked to his hostess , " This is a very beautiful room . Varian would have delighted in it , Miss Fairlie . Think how much he would have enjoyed sitting there , before that great window , talking with you and looking down over the Mediterranean ! " It was the only compliment that he had ever offered her , and he hoped that Isobel Fairlie understood its intended significance . He meant it to be conciliative . He wanted it to inform her that , for his part , he had renounced all hostility . It was pleasant to realize that he could now afford to be magnanimous . The success of his biography of Guy Varian had liquidated all old scores . Isobel Fairlie , he supposed , must have . sensed this ; else why had she so surprisingly invited him to break his journey to Italy by stopping for a night at her villa ? In the full flush of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harbor resentment . But , remembering the last five years of Varian 's life , he was impressed by the positive virtue of his forgivingness . She had very nearly disrupted his happy association with Varian . While Leighton was speaking , Isobel Fairlie had taken her place at the coffee-table . Her air of deliberation transformed the simple task of pouring into a rite . Leighton glanced at her , still amazed that she should have changed so little in the seven years since he had last seen her . The same slenderness , the same pallor , and the same ash-blond hair . The same suggestion of innocence which , so long ago , had first disarmed and then disquieted him . She must be well past fifty , he calculated , but she had preserved that strange resemblance to a Botticelli Madonna , which , in view of her legend , impressed him as being a gratuitous irony . " Coffee , Mr. Leighton ? " She extended his cup , and continued , " Thank you for saying what you just did . I have sometimes imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Leighton sipped the excellent coffee . " Varian was always happy to return to Marlow after any visit , " he stated reminiscently . " Even that last time , after his holiday with you at Lido . . . . The resumption of his usual routine accomplished wonders for him . You ca n't conceive how much he had improved after a week at home . " Isobel Fairlie flushed . " But he was an old man , Mr. Leighton , " she protested softly . " The journey up from Venice must have exhausted him in the heat of August . Besides , he had already contracted a cough . " Leighton nodded . " The cough had disappeared by the end of a week , " he retorted dryly . " Of course , as you say , he was n't a young man . But he never seemed old to me until he returned from that holiday . I was shocked by the change in his appearance . When he went out to join you , he did n't look a day over sixty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was seventy-five , " she said . " And he looked it , Miss Fairlie ! Every day of it ! " Leighton paused . Presently he continued , more amiably , " I 've sometimes wondered whether he had a premonition of impending death . He was so feverishly anxious to complete The Crystal Urn . In all the years that I served as his secretary , I never knew him to compose as rapidly as during the six weeks between his return from Lido and his final illness . Afterward I felt that he must have been racing with death . " " Ah ? " The interrogation , scarcely more than a whisper , touched off an annoyance which Leighton could not suppress . " Yes . After five years . Wasted years , one might say . And even then , he lost the race . " He was gratified by seeing her wince , by seeing pain gather in her gray eyes . He continued impulsively , eager to score his point . " I could n't help thinking during the memorial service of those wasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Varian 's finest book was never completed ! An unfinished masterpiece . And it need not have been , you know ! " " But a masterpiece , nevertheless , " Isobel Fairlie asserted , " which the world owes to you , Mr. Leighton . If you had not prepared it for the press . . . " Leighton replaced his coffee cup . " It was my duty to publish it , " he said . " A very painful duty , for knew what the book might have been . " Isobel Fairlie gave him a melancholy smile . " He left many books , Mr. Leighton , and he had very little happiness . Try to remember that . " The impertinence of her remark struck him forcibly . " Happiness ? " he inquired with a touch of sarcasm . " Yes , happiness , Mr. Leighton . It was my privilege to give him a little . . . " Her voice trailed off into silence , and she began twisting her string of pearls with the fingers of one band . The trivial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At dinner in Varian 's London flat there had been a momentary lull in the conversation , and he had noticed her trick of playing with her pearls . He stood irresolutely , waiting for her to continue , thinking of the dinner party . There flashed into his mind her remark to him when Varian had left them , briefly , alone , " I hope that we may become friends , Mr. Leighton . Our common devotion to a great man should unite us . " Before he had been able to reply , Varian had returned to the room . The silence was becoming almost audible . She broke it with a question . " Is n't it strange that , despite the fact that we have met only twice , we have been important factors in each other 's lives ? I suppose that there was always some hostility between us . You considered me an interloper , did n't you , Mr. Leighton ? And I thought of you only as an exacting taskmaster . But I never doubted the genuineness of your devotion to  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " her attack took him by surprise . He tried to phrase a courteous evasion , but succeeded only in saying , " Yes . " She went on as if she had not heard him , " You were devoted to the artist , I to the man . I quite realize the difference . But what still perplexes me is why you have always disliked me so intensely ? " Under her cool scrutiny Leighton felt inept and helpless . While he hesitated , struggling with his embarrassment , she proceeded urbanely , " Please be honest , Mr. Leighton . You are about to deny that you have disliked me . But you have , from the first moment of my friendship with Guy Varian . I wish you would tell me why . " Leighton was nettled by the effect of her questions , which seemed subtly to put him in the wrong . They implied a legitimate grievance which she politely refrained from expressing . His own sense of injury flared up again in an impulse to tell her the truth . Her rejection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further display of magnanimity . So the frustrated resentment of seven years blazed out in his reply . " I wonder that you ask me that question , Miss Fairlie ! I came here at your request , prepared to let bygones be bygones . But , since you demand the truth , give it to you . " He paused , controlled his mounting exasperation , and continued with what he hoped was a convincing show of dispassionateness . " I loved Guy Varian with a kind of devotion which I ca n't explain to you . When I first met him , seventeen years ago , I was launched in a modest fashion upon a career of my own . He offered me a post as his secretary , and I felt privileged in accepting . He was the author whom above all others I admired . As compared with the opportunity of becoming associated with him , ray previous ambitions seemed utterly negligible . I abandoned them without any regret . I became Varian 's secretary and , to a considerable degree , his intimate companion . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give up your own career , Mr. Leighton . " " I was glad to do it , " Leighton retorted . " I am glad to think that I was useful to Varian . And I was happy until you entered his life , Miss Fairlie . " Her fingers continued to busy themselves with the strand of pearls . " And in what way did I impair your happiness ? " she inquired . He smiled , savoring the long anticipated moment . " Your influence was positively destructive , " he told her . " Whether or not you were aware of it , Miss Fairlie , you prevented Varian from completing The Crystal Urn . During the five years of your intimacy with him he was almost continuously incapable of sustained work . If I had not known Varian so intimately I should have supposed him to be in love with you , and for some reason in love without hope . . . " Leighton broke off , a trifle disappointed by the effect of his indictment . Isobel Fairlie 's expression of amusement seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had merely succeeded in gratifying her insatiable vanity . " But you knew that he was not in love with me ? " she said , slightly stressing the reference to Leighton . " Oh , yes ! " he hastened to assure her . " Other people may have supposed him to be your lover . I believe that it was the general rumor . But I knew better , naturally . Varian was a misogynist . His emotional indifference to women was obvious , and profound . He liked to look at women if they were beautiful , or sit next them at dinner parties . He found their silliness diverting , he said . But otherwise , well , they simply did not exiat for him . I believe that you were the only exception in his long social experience . I think he respected your intelligence , and found your conversation stimulating . That is precisely why your influence was so damaging . You dissipated his creative energy . " " Are you basing this upon what he told you ? " Leighton reflected an instant before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , now that I think of it , we spoke of you only twice . After the night when you dined with us at the flat your name was never mentioned in our conversations . " Isobel Fairlie looked up at him and asked with unconcealed eagerness , " What did he say about me on the two occasions when I was discussed ? " " You were n't discussed , " Leighton retorted quickly . " Both occasions occurred on the day when Varian met you fur the first time . You recall , do n't you , that the Petershams invited him to meet you at dinner ? " She nodded . " Well , Varian wanted to decline the invitation , " Leighton proceeded . " He was afraid that you would n't justify your celebrity . his allusions to you were extremely skeptical , I remember . " " What were they , Mr. Leighton ? " There was a note of impatience in her question . Leighton was amused . " Well , you see , " be began , " I was totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had never heard of you or of your legend . Varian gave me an account of it . " " But exactly what did he say ? " Leighton pondered before replying . The conversation with Varian repeated itself in his memory with absolute precision . He could almost see Varian , tall , spare , white-haired , indolently smoking cigarettes as he paced up and down the fire-lit drawing-room . He could almost hear the purring , malicious voice : Varian was relishing the savory morsel of gossip . . . " What , my dear Leighton ? You 've never heard of Miss Fairlie ? But , my dear boy ! Art has already given her a kind of immortality ! " And Varian had gone on to tell him that Isobel Fairlie was an American of obscure originwhose European career had been made possible by a fortune bequeathed to her by an elderly California millionaire . She had never possessed beauty , yet she had always succeeded in captivating exceptional men . Men of genius had offered her their homage . There were , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Picasso . There were the three songs which Debussy had dedicated to her . There was the sonnet which Meredith had written for her in his old age . There was the fact that Marcel Proust has transparently disguised her as one of the characters in A la recherche du temps perdu . There was the rumor that a member of the British cabinet had resigned because royalty had neglected to include Miss Fairlie among its guests at Sandringham . Varian 's purring voice had gone on and on , enchanting Leighton with the legend of a woman who , lacking beauty , had cultivated intelligence , subjugating men by her wit and by her sprightly conversation . But Varian himself had been skeptical of the legend . He had grumbled that it was probably unjustified , and that to meet Miss Fairlie would give him only the dubious pleasure of confirming his own prejudices . In the end Leighton had prevailed upon him to accept the Petershams ' vitation . " I pointed out to him , " he told Miss Fairlie in conclusion , " that his prejudice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he asked me to ring up the Petershams and inform them that he would come . He went off grumbling . " Miss Fairlie favored him with her Madonna smile . " And the second conversation ? That was later ? " The discussion , Leighton began to perceive , had drifted away from his control . " Later the same evening , " he replied . " Varian returned from the dinner party pleased as Punch . So pleased that , for once , he was actually communicative . He told me that you justified your reputation . He 'd had a long talk with you , the best talk he 'd had in years . No mean praise , that , from Varian ! I suppose I betrayed my surprise . He assured me that his enthusiasm might not survive a second meeting . He dismissed it as one of the symptoms of approaching senility . He expected to be disappointed by you when he saw you again the following day . It was so unlike Varian to have made the engagement with you that I stupidly commented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject at once . " " And never mentioned me again ? " " And never mentioned you again , " Leighton repeated . " Except to inform me , some weeks later , that he had invited you to dine with us at the flat . " Leighton laughed , and then went on to explain , " He worried the cook about that dinner until she gave notice . Then I had to placate her . " " And then I came . . . Do you remember , Mr. Leighton , that I expressed a wish that we might become friends ? " Leighton nodded . " I remember one curious thing , " he said slowly . " After Varian 's account of his talk with you I became very eager to meet you . I wanted to hear you talk and all during dinner I waited for you to begin . But it was Varian who talked . And how very brilliantly ! I 'd never heard him in better form . Nevertheless , I was disappointed , because you were silent . Then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence . " He paused . She bent her head so that he could not see her eyes ; he wondered why . But she made no comment , and presently he continued , " Varian and I never referred to that evening . By that time his work hadalready commenced to fall off . The dictation was lagging painfully . Obviously he was finding it impossible to concentrate his attention on his book . Possibly this embarrassed him . He may have thought that my silence about you implied a reproach , as indeed it did . Or his conscience may have troubled him ; the book was announced by the publishers for the autumn . His dissatisfaction got expressed in a constant petulance with me . It was a disagreeable time . " Isobel Fairlie said , contritely , " I 'm sorry . I never knew . . . " " He behaved , " Leighton told her , " like a lovesick boy . When you left London , we went down to Marlow . I fancied that your absence and his return to the country might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more restless and less disposed to work . In the afternoons he shut himself up in his study , telling me that he had urgent personal correspondence to deal with . As he positively loathed using a pen , he had always dictated all his correspondence . So I assumed that he was writing daily letters to you . I watched our post-basket , but I never saw a single letter addressed to you . He must have taken them to the post himself . . . . Then , in August , he announced that he was leaving for a holiday at Lido . It was n't until after his departure that I learned that you had established yourself there . " " And you did n't think that he was in love with me ? " Isobel Fairlie asked quietly . Leighton shook his head . " No . Not once during the following five years . " He reflected a moment , and then said in a very low voice , " It would have been better for him if he had been , Miss Fairlie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously did . But you were n't generous enough to make him fall in love with you . He was an old man , and certainly the most eminent man of your acquaintance . You wanted , I believe , to add him permanently to your collection . You did , Miss Fairlie . The conquest ought to satisfy even your vanity . Your caprice cost the world a masterpiece of literature . " Leighton stared down at her . Tears were welling in her eyes . " I 'm sorry to have been discourteous , " he said . " But you asked me for the truth . I 've been honest . " Isobel Fairlie dabbed at her eyes with a bit of lace . " I 'm grateful to you , " she assured him , and rose from her chair . " You must be very weary after your journey and you have an early start to-morrow . I ought not to detain you longer , Mr. Leighton . We 'll meet again in the morning , before you leave . " Then , as if suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've had some books put on your table . Will you favor me with your opinion of them in the morning ? The request may seem peculiar , but I think you will understand it when you examine them . " She stretched out a hand languidly . " Good-night , Mr. Leighton . And thank you . " Upstairs in the guest-chamber , Leighton undressed slowly , still wondering what impulse had caused Isobel Fairlie to summon him to her villa . He had sent her an advance copy of his biography of Varian . Her acknowledgment , after a fortnight , had been a telegram inviting him to join her at Eze . He had replied , likewise by telegram , offering to stop overnight on his way to the Italian Riviera . Her invitation had surprised him as much by what it refrained from saying as by what it said . Thinking it over now , he recalled that the only other communication he had received from her had been equally her in Varian 's hand . Attached to it was a note directing him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the package as promptly as possible , without examination . The package was small , compact , and boxed ; Leighton had despatched it immediately . A few weeks later he had received a formal note of acknowledgment . He recalled now having thought it peculiar that she had given him no indication of what the package contained . Whatever the purpose of her invitation , it was clear that the biography had deeply impressed Miss Fairlie . Leighton was aware that vanity had dictated his acceptance . The secretary had been little more than a menial , but the biographer had become a personage in his own right . Fortified by a warmly laudatory press , there had been no risk in facing Isobel Fairlie . He perceived now , for the first time , that the actual issue between them had been a contest for the possession of Varian . Strangely enough , this contest had been decided , even before his arrival , by the acclaim with which his book had been received . Varian was now indisputably his , permanently and publicly enshrined within the pages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Philip Leighton , had acquired a prestige to which Isobel Fairlie 's deference testified eloquently . For she had been singularly deferent ; he realized that now . At dinner she had asked him many questions about various incidents in Varian 's career . He recalled now with some astonishment that he had talked at length about Varian 's quarrel with Whistler and about his controversy with Shaw at the time of the Boer War . It occurred to Leighton that his loquacity indicated that her interest had stimulated him more than he had been aware , for he had been fatigued by the long journey down from Paris and indisposed to any effort . It was certainly strange , he reflected , that on the two occasions when he had dined with Miss Fairlie , she had completely failed to display the conversational gifts for which she was so widely celebrated . Leighton drew on his pajamas , went to the window , threw it open , and stood looking down at the burnished track of moonlight on the sea . Presently he began to feel chilly and turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take him to the railway station at Nice early in the morning . By afternoon he would be across the Italian frontier . In all likelihood this would be his last meeting with Miss Fairlie , and from it he had learned nothing worth knowing . In an access of impatience he started to extinguish the lights . On the bedside table was a rose-quartz reading lamp . As he was about to clamber into bed he noticed beside the lamp a row of five leather-bound notebooks . Suddenly he recollected Isobel Fairlie 's peculiar request . He felt a premonitory excitement , picked up one of the notebooks , and turned back the cover . The pages were closely filled with Varian 's meticulous , cramped handwriting . He examined the other volumes rapidly . All of them had been painstakingly filled by Varian . Leighton had a swift intuition that in reading them he would make a distasteful discovery . For an instant he contemplated the possibility of refusing to read them . Then he realized that his curiosity made this course impossibk . He began to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the afternoon express for Paris . My brain was whirling . Never , it seemed to me , had I met a woman so exquisitely alluring , so finely intelligent . All the way across the Channel I could think only of you , and I resented this preoccupation , for never before had the like occurred to me . When I arrived at the Ritz I found a message from Marcel Proust saying that he would come to see me at midnight , as usual . I do n't remember how I spent the evening . Proust came . The poor chap is obviously very ill , but remarkably gallant . Knowing his friendship for you , I spoke of you , spoke as I was thinking , in hyperbole . To all my praise he assented until I began to speak of your subtle intelligence and the sparkle of your wit . And then he interrupted me with a strange and incomprehensible remark . ' You , too , man arra ? ' he said , smiling at me ; ah , well , one of these days you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more rare and precious than any which you have mentioned . ' " Leighton dropped the book . There dawned upon him the explanation of all the afternoons when Varian had shut himself into his study to write , of the package which Varian had left for Isobel Fairlie . He glanced quickly over the other notebooks . Letter after letter , written to Isobel Fairlie and never sent . They dated from within a fortnight of Varian 's first meeting with her to within a fortnight of his last illness . Why had Varian withheld them from Isobel Fairlie during his lifetime ? Leighton began to read again . In these letters Varian had poured out an urgent and despairing passion which Leighton had never suspected . As he read ou he felt a rising anger toward the dead man ; had not Varian betrayed him , delivered him to Isobel Fairlie for this subtle and humiliating revenge ? " I love you , " Leighton read , " I love you as no other man has ever loved you . I believe that you know this , my dearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become my wife you refused . I have asked you before ; always you have refused . And you have never explained your refusal to marry me although you say that you love me . This is madness , Isobel  --  or a systematic cruelty of which I can not suspect you . " Leighton read on , not pausing to think , mechanically noting how again and again as the weeks drew into years Varian recurred to his iterated proposals of marriage , and to Isobel Fairlie 's invariable , inexplicable rejection of him . At length , toward dawn , in a letter written only six months before Varian 's death , Leighton came upon this : " I understand now , have indeed understood for a long time past , what Proust meant by his obscure reference to the quality of your wisdom . Like everyone who has admired you , I have always praised your intelligence , your wit , the crystalline sparkle of your talk . I have contributed to your legend , dear Isobel , knowing it to be false . For in five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utter a memorable word . I have never felt the rapier thrust of your wit . I have never been taxed by the resources of your intelligence . In five years , my dear , it is I , not you , who have done all the talking . As for you , you have listened . You have listened graciously , sympathetically , persuasively , so that I have been compelled to give you the best of myself . In the beginning of our intimacy , remembering the quality of our talks , I gave you credit for having contributed the elements which made them so exceptional in my experience . In so doing , I was doing only what all other men have done , and thereby committing an injustice . " For your unique gift , my dear , is more rare and precious than a talent for conversation . It is the gift of listening creatively . Your silence is more illuminating than any words . It is genius to listen as you listen ; a wisdom far transcending what is usually termed intelligence . I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But men far more eminent than I have praised you for those lesser qualities of wit and fluency for which I , likewise , formerly esteemed you , and which you so conspicuously lack . Perhaps you believe in the truth of your legend , in the reality of your reputation . If so , you would be offended by my praise of what , to you , would seem a defect . I love you for your silence . But I fear to seem skeptical of your legend . Therefore , I shall continue to praise you , as everyone has praised you , for talents which you do not possess . To me you will always seem superior in the wisdom and grace of your heart , which have taught you silence . It is the true secret of your power , the source of your fascination for me . I shall never dare tell you this secret , Isobel . " Early in the morning Leighton stood on the terrace , waiting for Lobel Fairlie . When she joined him he asked , without preface or apology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you persist in that refusal ? " She looked out over the sea , deep blue under a blazing sun . " Because I loved him , " she said . " After reading those letters , do n't you understand ? " Leighton shook his head . " Because , Mr. Leighton , " she explained wearily , " I knew about myself what he knew about me . But I was ignorant of the fact that he knew it . I believed that he had fallen in love with my supposed intelligence . I realized that his admiration for it was an illusion that matrimony would destroy . What right did I have to destroy his illusion ? It was all I had to offer him , and I loved him . " Leighton said , " But if you loved him . . " She continued , " For as long as I might make him believe in his illusion , I felt that I could make him happy . For a few hours every day , for a few weeks every year , I knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished to believe . But not all day , every day , married to him . That is why I refused to marry him , Mr. Leighton . Do you understand , now ? And is n't it ironical that thesacrifice was useless ? Of all the men who have fancied themselves in love with me , he was the only one who knew me for what I am . And I refused him . " She paused , stared down at the brilliant sea , and Leighton waited for her to continue . But after a moment she said only , " If only he had had the courage to tell me . . I wish that he had known that I knew . " THIS GREEN , SMALL HOUR BY DOROTHY COWLES PINKNEY 1GHT , treat them gently in their misty sleeping . ?
