Illustration : " A little object lesson , as it were ! " The God in the Box By Sewell Peaslee Wright Sidenote : In the course of his Special Patrol duties Commander John Hanson resolves the unique and poignant mystery of " toma annerson . " This is a story I never intended to tell . I would not even tell it now if it were not for the Zenians . Understand that I do not dislike the Zenians . One of the best officers I ever had was a Zenian . His name was Eitel , and he served under me on the old Tamon , my first command . But lately the Zenians have made rather too much of the exploits of Ame Baove . The history of the Universe gives him credit , and justly , for making the first successful exploration in space . Baove 's log of that trip is a classic that every school-child knows . But I have a number of friends who are natives of Zenia , and they fret me with their boastings . " Well , Hanson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has done wonderful work , largely under the officership of Earth-men . But after all , you have to admit that it was a Zenian who first mastered space ! " Perhaps it is just fractiousness of an old man , but countless repetitions of such statements , in one form or another , have irritated me to the point of action  --  and before going further , let me say , for the benefit of my Zenian friends , that if they care to dig deeply enough into the archives , somewhere they will find a brief report of these adventures recorded in the log of one of my old ships , the Ertak , now scrapped and forgotten . Except , perhaps , by some few like myself , who knew and loved her when she was one of the newest and finest ships of the Service . I commanded the Ertak during practically her entire active life . Those were the days when John Hanson was not an old man , writing of brave deeds , but a youngster of half a century , or thereabouts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those old days , it seems hard for me to believe that John Hanson , Commander of the Ertak , and old John Hanson , retired , and a spinner of ancient yarns , are one and the same  --  but I must get on to my story , for youth is impatient , and from " old man " to " old fool " is a short leap for a youthful mind . * * * * * The Special Patrol Service is not all high adventure . It was not so even in the days of the Ertak . There was much routine patrolling , and the Ertak drew her full share of this type of duty . We hated it , of course , but in that Service you do what you are told and say nothing . We were on a routine patrol , with only one possible source of interest in our orders . The wizened and sour-faced scientists the Universe acclaims so highly had figured out that a certain planet , thus far unvisited , would be passing close to the line of our patrol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to inspect this body , and if inhabited , which was doubted , to make contact . There was a separate report , if I remember correctly , with a lot of figures . This world was not large ; smaller than Earth , as a matter of fact , and its orbit brought it into conjunction with our system only once in some immemorable period of time . I suppose that record is stored away , too , if anybody is interested in it . It was largely composed of guesses , and most of them were wrong . These white-coated scientists do a lot of wild guessing , if the facts were known . However , she did show up at about the place they had predicted . Kincaide , my second officer , was on duty when the television disk first picked her up , and he called me promptly . " Strobus "  --  that was the name the scientists had given this planet we were to look over  --  " Strobus is in view , sir , if you 'd like to look her over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to determine anything of interest , however , even with maximum power . " I considered for a moment , scowling at the microphone . " Very well , Mr. Kincaide , " I said at length . " Set a course for her . We 'll give her a glance , anyway . " " Yes , sir , " replied Kincaide promptly . One of the best officers in the Service , Kincaide . Level-headed , and a straight thinker . He was a man for any emergency . I remember  --  but I 've already told that story . * * * * * I turned back to my reports , and forgot all about this wandering Strobus . Then I turned in , to catch up somewhat on my sleep , for we had had some close calls in a field of meteors , and the memory of a previous disaster was still fresh in my mind. 1 I had spent my " watch below " in the navigating room , and now I needed sleep rather badly . If the scientists really want to do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do without food and sleep ? 1 See " The Ghost World " in the April issue of Amazing Stories .  --  Ed . When , refreshed and ready for anything , I did report to the navigating room , Correy , my first officer , was on duty . " Good morning , sir , " he nodded . It was the custom , on ships I commanded , for the officers to govern themselves by Earth standards of time ; we created an artificial day and night , and disregarded entirely , except in our official records , the enar and other units of the Universal time system . " Good morning , Mr. Correy . How are we bearing ? " " Straight for our objective , sir . " He glanced down at the two glowing charts that pictured our surroundings in three dimensions , to reassure himself . " She 's dead ahead , and looming up quite sizeably . " " Right ! " I bent over the great hooded television disk  --  the ponderous type we used in those days  --  and picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disk and I reduced the magnification until I could get a full view of the entire exposed surface . Strobus , it seemed , bore a slight resemblance to one view of my own Earth . There were two very apparent polar caps , and two continents , barely connected , the two of them resembling the numeral eight in the writing of Earth-men ; a numeral consisting of two circles , one above the other , and just touching . One of the roughly circular continents was much larger than the other . " Mr. Kincaide reported that the portions he inspected consisted entirely of fluid sir , " commented Correy . " The two continents now visible have just come into view , so I presume that there are no others , unless they are concealed by the polar caps . Do you find any indications of habitation ? " " I have n't examined her closely under high magnification , " I replied . " There are some signs .... " * * * * * I increased power , and began slowly searching the terrain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I found what I sought . " We 're in luck , Mr. Correy ! " I exclaimed . " Our friend is inhabited . There is at least one sizeable city on the larger continent and ... yes , there 's another ! Something to break the monotony , eh ? Strobus is an ' unknown ' on the charts . " " Suppose we 'll have trouble , sir ? " asked Correy hopefully . Correy was a prime hand for a fight of any kind . A bit too hot-headed perhaps , but a man who never knew when he was beaten . " I hope not ; you know how they rant at the Base when we have to protect ourselves , " I replied , not without a certain amount of bitterness . " They 'd like to pacify the Universe with never a sweep of a disintegrator beam . ' Of course , Commander Hanson ' some silver-sleeve will say , ' if it was absolutely vital to protect your men and your ship '  --  ugh ! They ought to turn out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what conditions are . " I was young then , and the attitude of my conservative superiors at the Base was not at all in keeping with my own views , at times . " You think , then , that we will have trouble , sir ? " " Your guess is as good is mine , " I shrugged . " The people of this Strobus know nothing of us . They will not know whether we come as friends or enemies . Naturally , they will be suspicious . It is hard to explain the use of the menore , to convey our thoughts to them . " I glanced up at the attraction meter , reflecting upon the estimated mass of the body we were approaching . By night we should be nearing her atmospheric envelope . By morning we should be setting down on her . " We 'll hope for the best , sir , " said Correy innocently . I bent more closely over the television disk , to hide my smile . I knew perfectly what the belligerent Correy meant by " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next morning , at atmospheric speed , we settled down swiftly over the larger of the two continents , Correy giving orders to the navigating room while I divided my attention between the television disk and the altimeter , with a glance every few seconds at the surface temperature gauge . In unknown atmospheres , it is not difficult to run up a considerable surface temperature , and that is always uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous . " The largest city seems to be nearer the other continent . You should be able to take over visually before long . Has the report on the atmosphere come through yet ? " " Not yet . Just a moment , sir . " Correy spoke for a moment into his microphone and turned to me with a smile . " Suitable for breathing , " he reported . " Slight excess of oxygen , and only a trace of moisture . Hendricks just completed the analysis . " Hendricks , my third officer , was as clever as a laboratory man in many ways , and a red-blooded young officer as well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often . " Good ! Breathing masks are a nuisance . I believe I 'd reduce speed somewhat ; she 's warming up . The big city I mentioned is dead ahead . Set the Ertak down as close as possible . " " Yes , sir ! " snapped Correy , and I leaned over the television disk to examine , at very close range , the great Strobian metropolis we were so swiftly approaching . * * * * * The buildings were all tall , and constructed of a shining substance that I could not identify , even though I could now make out the details of their architecture , which was exceedingly simple , and devoid of ornament of any kind , save an occasional pilaster or flying buttress . The streets were broad , and laid out to cut the city into lozenge-shaped sections , instead of the conventional squares . In the center of the city stood a great lozenge-shaped building with a smooth , arched roof . From every section of the city , great swarms of people were flocking in the direction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot and in long , slim vehicles of some kind that apparently carried several people . " Lots of excitement down there , Mr. Correy , " I commented . " Better tell Mr. Kincaide to order up all hands , and station a double guard at the port . Have a landing force , armed with atomic pistols and bombs , and equipped with menores , as an escort . " " And the disintegrator-ray generators  --  you 'll have them in operation , sir , just in case ? " " That might be well . But they are not to be used except in the greatest emergency , understand . Hendricks will accompany me , if it seems expeditious to leave the ship , leaving you in command here . " " Very well , sir ! " I knew the arrangement did n't suit him , but he was too much the perfect officer to protest , even with a glance . And besides , at the moment , he was very busy with orders to the men in the control room , forward , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set her down . But busy as he was , he did not forget the order to tune up the disintegrator-ray generators. * * * * * While the great circular door of the Ertak was backing out ponderously from its threaded seat , suspended by its massive gimbals , I inspected the people of this new world . My first impression was that they were a soldiery people , for there were no jostling crowds swarming around the ship , such as might have been expected . Instead , the citizenry stood at ease in a sort of military formation of numerous small companies , each apparently in charge of an officer . These companies were arranged to form a long wide avenue , leading to the city , and down this avenue a strange procession was coming toward the ship . I should make it clear at this point that these Strobians were , in form , very similar to Earth-men , although somewhat shorter in stature , and certainly more delicately formed . Perhaps it would be better to say they resembled the Zenians , save for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their skins being nearly translucent , and their hair a light straw color . The darkest hair I saw at any time was a pale gold , and many had hair as colorless as silver  --  which I should explain is a metal of Earth somewhat resembling aluminum in appearance . The procession was coming toward the ship slowly , the marchers apparently chanting as they came , for I could see their lips moving . They were dressed in short kirtles of brilliant colors  --  scarlet , green , orange , purple  --  and wore brilliant belts suspended about their waists by straps which crossed over their breasts and passed over each shoulder . Each marcher bore a tall staff from which flew a tiny pennon of the same color as his chief garment . At the top of each staff was a metal ornament , which at first glance I took to be the representation of a fish . As they came closer , I saw that this was not a good guess , for the device was without a tail . * * * * * " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hendricks . " The people seem far from hostile , and the air is very good . What are your orders ? " " There will be no change , I think , " I said as I hurried toward the now open door . " Mr. Kincaide will be in command of the guard at the port . You and I , with a small landing force , will advance to meet this procession . Make sure that there are a number of extra menores carried by the escort ; we shall need them . " " Yes , sir ! " Hendricks snapped a command and the landing force fell into place behind us as we passed through the circular doorway , and out onto the rocky ground of Strobus . The procession stopped instantly , and the chanting died to a murmur . The men forming the living wall on each side bowed their heads and made a quick sign ; a peculiar gesture , as though they reached out to shake an invisible hand . The leader of the procession , a fine-featured man with golden hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrase over and over again in a voice as sweet as a woman 's : " Toma annerson ... toma annerson ... toma annerson .... " " Sounds friendly enough , " I whispered to Hendricks . " Hand me an extra menore ; I 'll see .... " The chanting stopped , and the Strobian lifted his head . " Greetings ! " he said . " You are welcome here . " * * * * * I think nothing ever surprised me more , I stared at the man like a fool , my jaw dropping , and my eyes bulging . For the man spoke in a language of Earth ; spoke it haltingly and poorly , but recognizably . " You  --  you speak English ? " I faltered . " Where  --  where did you learn to speak this language ? " The Strobian smiled , his face shining as though he saw a vision . " Toma annerson , " he intoned gravely , and extended his right hand in a greeting which Earth-men have offered each other for untold centuries ! I shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I thank you for your welcome , " I said , gathering my wits at last . " We come as friends , from worlds not unlike your own . We are glad that you meet us as friends . " " It was so ordered . He ordered it so and Artur is His mouthpiece in this day . " The Strobian weighed every word carefully before he uttered it speaking with a solemn gravity that was most impressive . " Artur ? " I questioned him . " That is your name ? " " That is my name , " he said proudly . " It came from He Who Speaks who gave it to my father many times removed . " There were many questions in my mind , but I could not be outdone in courtesy by this kindly Strobian . " I am John Hanson , " I told him , " Commander of the Special Patrol Service ship Ertak . This is Avery Hendricks , my third officer . " " Much of that , " said Artur slowly , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He bowed again , first to me , and then to Hendricks , who was staring at me in utter amazement . " You will come with us now , to the Place ? " Artur added . I considered swiftly , and turned to Hendricks . " This is too interesting to miss , " I said in an undertone . " Send the escort back with word for Mr. Correy that these people are very friendly , and we are going on into the city . Let three men remain with us . We will keep in communication with the ship by menore. " * * * * * Hendricks gave the necessary orders , and all our escort , save for three men , did a brisk about face and marched back to the ship . The five of us , conducted by Artur , started for the city , the rest of the procession falling in behind us . Behind the double file of the procession , the companies that had formed the living wall marched twenty abreast . Not all the companies , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great hollow square about the Ertak , a great motionless guard of honor , clad in kirtles like the pennon-bearers in the procession , save that their kirtles were longer , and pale green in color . The uniform of their officers was identical , save that it was somewhat darker in color , and set of with a narrow black belt , without shoulder straps . We marched on and on , into the city , down the wide streets , walled with soaring buildings that shone with an iridescent lustre , toward the great domed building I had seen from the Ertak . The streets were utterly deserted , and when we came close to the building I saw why . The whole populace was gathered there ; they were drawn up around the building in orderly groups , with a great lane opened to the mighty entrance . There were women waiting there , thousands of them , the most beautiful I have ever seen , and in my younger days I had eyes that were quick to note a pretty face . Through these great silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and very much bewildered . Every head was bowed as though in reverence , and the chanting of the men behind us was like the singing of a hymn . * * * * * At the head of the procession , we entered the great domed , lozenge-shaped building , and I stared around in amazement . The structure was immense , but utterly without obstructing columns , the roof being supported by great arches buttressed to pilasters along the walls , and furnished with row after row of long benches of some polished , close-grained red wood , so clear that it shone brilliantly . There were four great aisles , leading from the four angles of the lozenge , and many narrower ones , to give ready access to the benches , all radiating from a raised dais in the center , and the whole building illuminated by bluish globes of light that I recognized from descriptions and visits to scientific museums , as replicas of an early form of the ethon tube . These things I took in at a glance . It was the object upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hendricks ! " I muttered , just loud enough to make my voice audible above the solemn chanting . " Are we dreaming ? " " No , sir ! " Hendricks ' eyes were starting out of his head , and I have no doubt I looked as idiotic as he did . " It 's there . " On the dais was a gleaming object perhaps sixty feet long  --  which is a length equal to the height of about ten full-sized men . It was shaped like an elongated egg  --  like the metal object surmounting the staffs of the pennon-bearers ! And , unmistakably , it was a ship for navigating space . * * * * * As we came closer , I could make out details . The ship was made of some bluish , shining metal that I took to be chromium , or some compound of chromium , and there was a small circular port in the side presented to us . Set into the blunt nose of the ship was a ring of small disks , reddish in color , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I could not determine . Around the more pointed stern were innumerable small vents , pointed rearward , and smoothly stream-lined into the body . The body of the ship fairly glistened , but it was dented and deeply scratched in a number of places , and around the stern vents the metal was a dark , iridescent blue , as though stained by heat . The chanting stopped as we reached the dais , and I turned to our guide . He motioned that Hendricks and I were to precede him up a narrow , curving ramp that led upwards , while the three Zenians who accompanied us were to remain below . I nodded my approval of this arrangement , and slowly we made our way to the top of the great platform , while the pennon-bearers formed a close circle around its base , and the people , who had surrounded the great building filed in with military precision and took seats . In the short space of time that it took us to reach the top of the dais , the whole great building filled itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces and made a sweeping gesture , as of benediction . " Toma annerson ! " His voice rang out like the clear note of a bell , filling that vast auditorium . In a great wave , the assembled people seated themselves , and sat watching us , silent and motionless . * * * * * Artur walked to the edge of the dais , and stood for a moment as though lost in thought . Then he spoke , not in the language which I understood , but in a melodious tongue which was utterly strange . His voice was grave and tender ; he spoke with a degree of feeling which stirred me even though I understood no word that he spoke . Now and again I heard one recognizable sequence of syllables , that now familiar phrase , " toma annerson . " " Wonder what that means , sir ? " whispered Hendricks . " ' Toma annerson ? ' Something very special , from the way he brings it out . And do you know what we are here for , and what all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I have some ideas , but they 're too wild for utterance . We 'll just go slow , and take things as they come . " As I spoke , Artur concluded his speech , and turned to us . " John Hanson , " he said softly , " our people would hear your voice . " " But  --  but what am I to say ? " I stammered . " I do n't speak their language . " " It will be enough , " he muttered , " that they have heard your voice . " He stood aside , and there was nothing for me to do but walk to the edge of the platform , as he had done , and speak . My own voice , in that hushed silence , frightened me . I would not have believed that so great a gathering could maintain such utter , deathly silence . I stammered like a school-child reciting for the first time before his class . " People of Strobus , " I said  --  this is as nearly as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less intelligent  --  " we are glad to be here . The welcome accorded us overwhelms us . We have come ... we have come from worlds like your own , and ... and we have never seen a more beautiful one . Nor more kindly people . We like you , and we hope that you will like us . We wo n't be here long , anyway . I thank you ! " * * * * * I was perspiring and red-faced by the time I finished , and I caught Hendricks in the very act of grinning at his commander 's discomfiture . One black scowl wiped that grin off so quickly , however , that I thought I must have imagined it . " How was that , Artur ? " I asked . " All right ? " " Your words were good to hear , John Hanson , " he nodded gravely . " In behalf  --   --  " The hundreds of blue lights hung from the vaulted roof clacked suddenly and went out . Almost instantly they flashed on again  --  and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in darkness , and , when they came on again , a murmur that was like a vast moan rose from the sea of humanity surrounding the dais . And the almost beautiful features of Artur were drawn and ghastly with pain . " They come ! " he whispered . " At this hour , they come ! " " Who , Artur ? " I asked quickly . " Is there some danger ? " " Yes . A very great one . I will tell you , but first  --  " He strode to the edge of the dais and spoke crisply , his voice ringing out like the thin cry of military brass . The thousands in the auditorium rose in unison , and swept down the aisles toward the doors . " Now , " cried Artur , " I shall tell you the meaning of that signal . For three or four generations , we have awaited it with dread . Since the last anniversary of his coming , we have known the time was not far off . And it had to come at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * * * " The signal warns us that the Neens have at last made good their threat to come down upon us with their great hordes . The Neens were once men like ourselves , who would have none of Him "  --  and Artur glanced toward the gleaming ship upon the dais  --  " nor His teachings . They did not like the new order , and they wandered off , to join those outcasts who had broken His laws , and had been sent to the smaller land of this world , where it is always warm , and where there are great trees thick with moss , and the earth underfoot steams , and brings forth wriggling life . Neen , we call that land , as this larger land is called Libar . " These men of Neen became the enemies of Libar , and of us who call ourselves Libars , and follow His ways . In that warm country they became brown , and their hair darkened . They increased more rapidly than did the Libars , and as they forgot their learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have always envied us ; envied us the beauty of our women , and of our cities . Envied us those things which He taught us to make , and which their clumsy hands can not fashion , and which their brutish brains do not understand . " And now they have the overwhelming strength that makes us powerless against them . " His voice broke , he turned his face away , that I might not see the agony written there . " Toma annerson ! " he muttered . " Ah , toma annerson ! " The words were like a prayer . " Just a minute , Artur ! " I said sharply . " What weapons have they ? And what means of travel ? " He turned with a hopeless gesture . " They have the weapons we have , " he said . " Spears and knives and short spears shot from bows . And for travel they have vast numbers of monocars they have stolen from us , generation after generation . " " Monocars ? " I asked , startled . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , He was wise ; to hear His voice was to feel in touch with all the wisdom of all the air ! " He made a gesture as though to include the whole universe . * * * * * There were a score of questions in my mind , but there was no time for them then . I snatched my menore from its clip on my belt , and adjusted it quickly . It was a huge and cumbersome thing , the menore of that day , but it worked as well as the fragile , bejeweled things of today . Maybe better . The guard posted outside the ship responded instantly . " Commander Hanson emanating , " I shot at him . " Present my compliments to Mr. Correy , and instruct him as follows : He is to withdraw the outside guard instantly , and proceed with the Ertak to the large domed building in the center of the city . He will bring the Ertak to rest at the lowest possible altitude above the building , and receive further orders at that time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost word for word , and I removed the menore with a little flourish . Oh , I was young enough in those days ! " Do n't worry any more , Artur , " I said crisply . " I do n't know who He was , but we 'll show you some tricks you have n't seen yet ! Come ! " I led the way down the ramp , Hendricks , Artur , and the three Zenians following . As we came out into the daylight , a silent shadow fell across the great avenue that ran before the entrance , and there , barely clearing the shining roof of the auditorium , was the sleek , fat bulk of the Ertak . Correy had wasted no time in obeying orders . Correy could smell a fight further than any man I ever knew . * * * * * From her emergency landing trap , the Ertak let down the cable elevator , and the six of us , Hendricks , Artur , the three Zenians of the crew , and myself , were shot up into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to greet me . " What are the orders , sir ? " he asked , staring curiously at Artur . " Is there trouble brewing ? " " I gather that there is , but we 'll talk about that in a moment  --  in the navigating room . " I introduced Artur and Correy as we hurried forward , and as soon as the door of the navigating room had closed on the three of us , I turned to Artur with a question . " Now , where will we find the enemy , these Neens ? Have you any idea ? " " Surely , " nodded Artur . " They come from their own country , to the south . The frontier is the narrow strip of land that connects Libar with Neen , and since the alarm has been sounded , the enemy is already at the frontier , and the forces of my people and the enemy are already met . " " I do n't know anything about the set-up , " put in Correy , " but that sounds like poor management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or spies , or outposts ? " Artur shook his head sadly . " My people are not warlike . We who spread His teachings have tried to warn the masses , but they would not listen . The land of the Neens was far away . The Neens had never risen against the Libars . They never would . So my people reasoned . " " And you think there is fighting in progress now ? " I asked . " How did the word come ? " " By phone or radio , I presume , " said Artur . " We are in communication with the frontier by both methods , and the signal of the lights has been arranged for generations . In the day , all lights were to flash on three times ; at night , they were to be darkened three times . " * * * * * So they had telephones and radios ! It was most amazing , but my questions could wait . They would have to wait . Correy was shuffling his feet with anxiety for orders to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " Close the ports and ascend to a height that will enable you to navigate visually . You are sufficiently familiar with the country to understand our objective ? " " Yes , sir ! Studied it coming down . It 's that neck of land that separates the two continents . " He picked up the microphone , and started punching buttons and snapping orders . In twenty seconds we were rushing , at maximum atmospheric speed , toward the scene of what , Artur had told us , was already a battle . Artur proved to be correct . As we settled down over the narrow neck of land , we could see the two forces locked in frenzied combat ; the Libars fighting with fine military precision , in regular companies , but outnumbered at least five to one by the mob-like masses of brown Neens . From the north and from the south slim , long vehicles that moved with uncanny swiftness were rushing up reserve forces for both sides . There were far more monocars serving the Libars , but each car brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back loaded with wounded . " I thought you said your people were n't fighters , Artur ? " I said . " They 're fighting now , like trained soldiers . " " Surely . They are well trained , but they have no fighting spirit , like the enemy . Their training , it is no more than a form of amusement , a recreation , the following of custom . He taught it , and my people drill , knowing not for what they train . See ! Their beautiful ranks crumple and go down before the formless rush of the Neens ! " " The disintegrator beams , sir ? " asked Correy insidiously . " No . That would be needless slaughter . Those brown hordes are witless savages . An atomic bomb , Mr. Correy . Perhaps two of them , one on either flank of the enemy . Will you give the order ? " * * * * * Correy rapped out the order , and the ship darted to the desired position for the first bomb  --  darted so violently that Artur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said , motioning to Artur to share a port with me . The bomb fled downward , a swift black speck . It struck perhaps a half mile to the west ( to adopt Earth measures and directions ) of the enemy 's flank . As it struck , a circle of white shot out from the point of impact , a circle that barely touched that seething west flank . The circle paled to gray , and settled to earth . Where there had been green , rank growth , there was now no more than a dirty red crater , and the whole west flank of the enemy was fleeing wildly . I said the whole west flank ; that was not true . There were some that did not flee : that would never move again . But there was not one hundredth part of the number that would not have dissolved into dust with one sweep of the disintegrator ray through that pack of striving humanity . " The other flank , Mr. Correy , " I said quietly . " And just a shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it were ! " * * * * * The battle was at a momentary standstill . The Neens and the Libars seemed , for the moment , to forget the issue ; every face was turned upward . Even the faces of the runners who fled from a disaster they did not understand . " I think one more will be enough , sir , " chuckled Correy . " The beggars are ready to run for it right now . " He gave a command , and as though the microphone itself released the bomb , it dropped from the bottom of the Ertak and diminished swiftly as it hurtled earthward . Again the swift spread of white that turned to gray ; again the vast red crater . Again , too , a flank crumpled . As though I could see the faces of the brown men , I saw terror strike to the heart of the Neens . The flanks were melting away , and the panic of fear spread as flame spreads on a surface of oil . Correy has a good eye for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the enemy massed there . If there were , in the space that it takes the heart to tick ten times , fifty thousand Neens turned their back to the enemy and fled to the safety of their own jungles . * * * * * The Libars made no effort to pursue . They stood there , in their military formations , watching with wonderment . Then , with crisp military dispatch , they maneuvered into great long ranks , awaiting the arrival of transportation . " And so it is finished , John Hanson , " said Artur slowly , his eyes shining with a light that might almost be called holy . " My people are saved ! He spoke well , as always , when He said that those who would come after Him would be our friends if we were their friends . " " We are your friends , " I replied , " but tell me , who is this one of whom you speak always , but do not name ? From what I have seen , I guess a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story . Will you tell me , now ? " " I will , if that is your wish , " said Artur , " but I should prefer to tell you in the Place . It is a long story , the story of toma annerson , the story of He Who Speaks , and there are things you should see , so that you may understand that story . " " As you wish , Artur . " I glanced at Correy and nodded . " Back to the city , Mr. Correy . I think we 're through here . " " I believe we are , sir . " He gave the orders to the operating room , and the Ertak swung in a great circle toward the gleaming city of the Libars . " It looked like a real row when we got here ; I would n't have minded being down there for a few minutes myself . " " With the Ertak poised over your head , dropping atomic bombs ? " Correy shook his head and grinned . " No , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with clubs . " * * * * * Artur and I were together in the great domed building he called " the Place . " There were no others in that vast auditorium , although outside a multitude waited . Artur had expressed a wish that no one accompany me , and I could see no valid reason for refusing the request . " First , " he said , pausing beside the great shining body of the space ship upon the central dais , " let me take you back many generations , to the time when only this northern continent was inhabited , and the Libars and the Neens were one people . " In those days , we were of less understanding than the Neens of today . There were no cities ; each family lived to itself , in crude huts , tilling the ground and hunting its own food . Then , out of the sky came this . " He touched , reverently , the smooth side of the space ship . " It came to earth at this very spot , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would you inspect the ship that brought Him here ? " " Gladly , " I said , and as I spoke , Artur swung open the small circular door . A great ethon flashlight , of a type still to be seen in our larger museums , stood just inside the threshold , and aided by its beams , we entered . I stared around in amazement . The port through which he had entered led to a narrow compartment running lengthwise of the ship : a compartment twice the length of a man , perhaps , and half the length of a man in breadth . The rest of the ship was cut off by bulkheads , each studded with control devices the uses of which I could but vaguely understand . * * * * * Forward was a veritable maze of instruments , mounted on three large panels , the central panel of the group containing a circular lens which apparently was the eyepiece of some type of television disk the like of which I have never seen or heard . From my hasty examination I gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an early type of propulsion which was abandoned as ineffective ) and some form of attraction-repulsion apparatus , evidently functioning through the reddish , pitted disks I had observed around the nose of the ship . The lettering upon the control panels and the instruments , while nearly obliterated , was unmistakably in the same language in which Artur had addressed us . The ship had , beyond the shadow of doubt , come from Earth ! " Artur , " I said gravely , " you have shown me that which has stirred me more than anything in my life . This ship of the air came from my own world , which is called Earth . " " True , " he nodded , " that is the name He gave to it : Earth . He was a young man , but He was full of kindness and wisdom . He took my people out of the fields and the forests , and He taught them the working of metals , and the making of such things as He thought were good . Other things , of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruments He could hold in His hand , and which roared suddenly , that would take the life of large animals at a great distance , but He did not explain these , saying that they were bad . But all the good things He made for my people , and showed them how to make others . * * * * * " Not all my people were good . Some of them hated this great one , and strove against Him . They were makers of trouble , and He sent them to the southern continent , which is called Neen . Those among my people who loved Him and served Him best , He made His friends . He taught them His language , which is this that I speak , and which has been the holy language of His priests since that day . He gave to these friends names from his own country , and they were handed down from father to son , so that I am now Artur , as my father was Artur , and his father before him , for many generations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . " Artur ? That is not  --  ah ! Arthur ! That is the name : Arthur . " " Perhaps so , " nodded the priest of this unknown Earth-child . " In many generations , a name might slightly change . But I must hasten on with my story , for outside my people become impatient . " In the course of time , He passed away , an old man , with a beard that was whiter than the hair of our new-born children . Here , our hair grows dark with age , but His whitened like the metal of his ship that brought Him here . But He left to us His voice , and so long as His voice spoke to us on the anniversary of the day upon which He came out of the sky , the Neens believed that His power still protected His people . " But the Neens were only awaiting the time when His voice would no longer sound in the Place . Each year their brown and savage representatives came , upon the anniversary , to listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own kind with the word that He Who Speaks , still spoke to His people . " But the last anniversary , no sound came forth . His voice was silenced at last ; and the Neens went back rejoicing , to tell their people that at last the god of the Libars had truly died , and that His voice sounded no more in the Place . " * * * * * A tense excitement gripped me ; my hands trembled , and my voice , as I spoke to Artur , shook with emotion . " And this voice  --  it came from where , Artur ? " I whispered . " From here . " Sorrowfully , reverently , he lifted , from a niche in the wall , a small box of smooth , shining metal , and lifted the lid . Curiously , I stared at the instruments revealed . In one end of the horizontal panel was a small metal membrane , which I guessed was a diaphragm . In the center of the remaining space was thrust up a heavy pole of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it did not quite touch the pole of rusty metal , was a bright wire , which disappeared through tiny holes in the panel , on either side . Each of the brackets which supported the wire was tipped with a tiny roller , which led me to believe that the wire was of greater length than was revealed , and designed to be drawn over the upright piece of metal . " Until the last anniversary , " said Artur sadly , " when one touched this small bit of metal , here , "  --  he indicated a lever beside the diaphragm , which I had not noted  --  " this wire moved swiftly , and His voice came forth . But this anniversary , the wire did not move , and there was no voice . " " Let me see that thing a moment . " There were hinges at one end of the panel , and I lifted it carefully . An intricate maze of delicate mechanism came up with it . * * * * * One thing I saw at a glance : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atomic generator . And I had been right about the wire : there was a great orderly coil of it on one spool , and the other end was attached to an empty spool . The upright of rusty metal was the pole of an electro-magnet , energized by the atomic generator . " I think I see the trouble , Artur ! " I exclaimed . One of the connections to the atomic generator was badly corroded ; a portion of the metal had been entirely eaten away , probably by the electrolytic action of the two dissimilar metals . With trembling fingers I made a fresh connection , and swung down the hinged panel . " This is the lever ? " I asked . " Yes ; you touch it so . " Artur moved the bit of metal , and instantly the shining wire started to move , coming up through the one small hole , passing , on its rollered guides , directly over the magnet , and disappearing through the other hole , to be wound up on the take-up spool . For an instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wire on its rollers , and then a bass , powerful voice spoke from the vibrating metal diaphragm : " I am Thomas Anderson , " said the voice . " I am a native of a world called Earth , and I have come through space to this other sphere . I leave this record , which I trust is imperishable , so that when others come to follow me , they may know that to Earth belongs the honor , if honor it be , of sending to this world its first visitor from the stars . " There is no record on Earth of me nor of my ship of space , the Adventurer . The history of science is a history of men working under the stinging lash of criticism and scoffing ; I would have none of that . * * * * * " The Adventurer was assembled far from the cities , in a lone place where none came to scoff or criticize . When it was finished , I took my place and sealed the port by which I had entered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of the Twenty-second century , as time is computed on Earth , man first found himself in outer space . " I landed here by chance . My ship had shot its bolt . Perhaps I could leave , but the navigation of space is a perilous thing , and I could not be sure of singling out my native Earth . This is a happy world , and the work I am doing here is good work . Here I remain . " And now , to you who shall hear this , my voice , in some year so far away that my bones shall be less than dust , and the mind refuses to compute the years , let me give into your charge the happiness and the welfare of these , my people . May peace and happiness be your portion . That is the wish of Earth 's first orphan , Thomas Anderson . " There was a click , and then the sharp hum of the wire re-spooling itself on the original drum . " Toma annerson , " said Artur solemnly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand to me , and I understood , as I shook hands gravely , that this old Earth greeting had become a holy sign among these people . And I understood also the meaning of the familiar phrase , " toma annerson " ; it was the time-corrupted version of that name they held holy  --  the name of Thomas Anderson , child of my own Earth , and explorer of space centuries before Ame Baove saw his first sun . * * * * * There is more I could tell of Strobus and its people , but an old man 's pen grows weary . The menace of the Neens , Artur agreed , had been settled forever . They knew now that He Who Speaks still watched over the welfare of his people . The Neens were an ignorant and a superstitious people , and the two great craters made by our atomic bombs would be grim reminders to them for many generations to come . " You have done all that need be done , John Hanson , " said Artur , his face alight with gratitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my people ! " Before I could protest , he signalled to the men who guarded the four great entrances , and my words were lost in the instant tramp of thousands of feet marching down the broad aisles . When they were all seated , Artur spoke to them , not in the " holy " language I understood , but in their own common tongue . I stood there by the ship , feeling like a fool , wondering what he was saying . In the end he turned to me , and motioned for me to join him , where he stood near the edge of the dais . As I did so , every person in that monstrous auditorium rose and bowed his head . " They greet you as the successor to He Who Speaks , " said Artur gently . " They are a simple folk , and you have served them well . You are a man of many duties that must soon carry you away , but first will you tell these people that you are their friend , as Toma Annerson was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * For the second time that day I made a speech . " Friends , " I said , " I have heard the voice of a great countryman of mine , who is dead these countless centuries , and yet who lives today in your hearts . I am proud that the same star gave us birth . " It was n't much of a speech , but they did n't understand it , anyway . Artur translated it for them , and I think he embroidered it somewhat , for the translation took a long time . " They worship you as the successor to Toma Annerson , " whispered Artur as the people filed from the great auditorium . " Your fame here will be second only to His , for you saved , to-day , the people He called His own . " We left just as darkness was falling , and as I shot up to the hovering Ertak , the chant of Artur and his bright-robed fellows was the last sound of Strobus that fell upon my ears . They were intoning the praises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my good Zenian friends , you learn of the first man to brave the dangers of outer space . He left no classic journal behind him as did Ame Baove , nor did he return to tell of the wonders he had found . But he did take strong root where he fell in his clumsy craft , and if this record , supported only by the log of the Ertak , needs further proof , some five or six full generations from now Strobus will be close enough for doubting Zenians to visit . And they will find there , I have no least doubt , the enshrined Adventurer , and the memory , not only of Thomas Anderson , but of one , John Hanson , Commander ( now retired ) of the Special Patrol Service .
