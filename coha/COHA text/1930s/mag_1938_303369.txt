" The U. S. for some years has been the leading exporter among the nations of the world . . . . We export , on the average , more than one-third of our total production of leaf tobacco , half of our cotton , half of our phosphate rock and between a fourth and a half of our total production of canned and dried fruits . Among manufactured products , we export from a fourth to a half of our total production of sewing machines , printing and bookbinding machinery , office appliances , agricultural implements and aircraft . One out of ten of all American-made automobiles normally goes abroad . . . . Likewise , substantial quantities of our petroleum products , foodstuffs , wood-pulp and copper-to mention only a few items-are produced for the foreign market . . . . " Author of this exposition is ruddy President Warren Lee Pierson of the Export-Import Bank of Washington , official guardian and nursemaid of this enormous trade . Last week his bank made one loan , was at work on another , which heralded a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the particularly fertile field of South America . <P> Assistance for U. S. exports was made necessary by three great post-War changes - the building of huge tariff walls , the U. S. shift from a debtor to a creditor nation and the establishment by competing nations of export credit agencies . With almost every foreign nation in debt to the U. S. , none had money to buy U. S. products ; and the U. S. banking system , developed for a debtor nation , had no machinery for providing foreign buyers with long-term credits . The first Export-Import Bank was created by Franklin Roosevelt in 1934 to fill the need for Russia alone . Pending debt settlements between the two countries , this bank did nothing and the Second Export-Import Bank was set up to handle credits for Cuba . When negotiations with Russia finally broke down , the two banks were merged with power to lend to all nations except Russia . <P> Since then the Export-Import Bank . $20,000,000 of whose $21,000,000 capital stock is held by RFC , has lent on three bases : to U. S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital has been pinched by foreign exchange restrictions ( i. e. , blocked marks in Germany ) , and , most important , to U. S. exporters who wish to sell capital goods to foreigners who lack cash . Sample deal took place year ago when China bought 20 locomotives and equipment with credits of $1,500,000 , half supplied by the Export-Import Bank , half by American Locomotive Sales Corp . and Baldwin Locomotive Works . Despite the war , China has punctually met all payments on this debt , as have virtually all the bank 's creditors . Up to last week they had already paid back $29,191,254.32 on total loans of $44,746,015.38 . <P> These deals have ranged over the globe from Iran to Venezuela . Henceforth , there is likely to be an increasing volume in South America , for there the export credit bureaus of Germany and Italy have lately raised havoc with U. S. trade by government-sponsored credit leniency . Thwarting these two dictatorships is close to Franklin Roosevelt 's heart ( see p. 8 ) and in this instance it fits perfectly with the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
