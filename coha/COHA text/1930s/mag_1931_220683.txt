From a questionnaire to leading men 's and women 's colleges , it was evident last week that the 1931 graduate is having an exceedingly difficult time finding a job . <P> Fewer corporations than in previous springs have sent scouts to the colleges and universities . <P> The demand for college-trained men to sell things on commission ( insurance , etc. ) is still great . These , of course , are the least attractive jobs . <P> Calls for teachers have fallen off , except for teachers of Science and Mathematics in secondary schools . And for such teaching there is a dearth of adequately trained applicants . The same inadequacy of trained personnel applies to headships of private girls ' schools . <P> Civil engineers , chemical engineers and building construction men have few openings . But prospective sales engineers and to a less extent prospective advertising men have a fair chance for employment . <P> Newspapers and magazines are closed tight . <P> While jobs are fewer , graduates need jobs more . College placement bureaus show a large increase of applications over last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially at the New England schools , the graduate expected to spring from the commencement platform to an executive desk . Now he is eager to be even an errand boy . <P> In one respect the average 1931 graduate is finicky . He would rather avoid a business where the prospects of career are not clear . Hence many are deliberately taking time out . The majority of those who are not seeking work immediately after graduating are going into graduate schools , for two reasons : 1 ) to " escape from reality " ; 2 ) to make themselves specialists . A large ratio of the aspirant specialists are trying to get into graduate schools of business , realizing that U. S. Business has become a skilled profession . <P> A sharp footlight on the whole situation glares at Smith College . Every girl in the June graduating class asked placement bureau help in getting work . Three out of four of the graduates expected to make work their profession for at least the immediate future . Only one out of 20 expected to marry , travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last June the expectant brides , travelers and homebodies averaged one out of ten . <P> Of all the colleges questioned Princeton , Stanford and Antioch stood out as least affected by Depression . <P> Antioch College this June reaped precious usufruct of its work-study plan . Cooperative arrangements between classroom and factory , office or field were maintained with difficulty through last year . But , exulted Antioch last week , " They were maintained . " Antioch seniors who want jobs have them , even though one man has been cooking on a Venezuela oil tanker and another is barnstorming the U. S. with an autogiro . <P> An alleviation of this current economic situation suggested itself to Acting Dean George Walker Mullins of Barnard College . To the girl graduates he put a proposition : <P> " What are your needs ? . . . Is it necessary for you to be gainfully employed ? If not , perhaps the greatest service that you can render to the community and to the nation at this time , when countless thousands are out of work , is to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prolong your period of study with a view to better equipping yourself in a richer way for future work .
