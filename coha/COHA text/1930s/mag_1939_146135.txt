The undisputed first lady of radio as of 1939 is 235-lb. , 29-year-old Contralto Kate Smith . For eight successful radio years Kate Smith has used her booming , unschooled voice , plus occasional bursts of hearty Americanism to sell millions of dollars worth of cigars , automobiles , coffee and , since 1937 , General Foods cake flour , baking powder and salt . From her paychecks she has tucked away $1,000,000 , mostly in Government bonds , but she is still unmarried , lives alone . She has won 15,000,000 weekly listeners , but she can count scarcely a dozen intimate friends . <P> Last week this publicly expansive first lady was guaranteed her radio job , at a salary of at least $7,000 a week , for three more years , in a non-cancellable contract the like of which has been written in radio only once before ( for Jack Benny two years ago ) . Most radio contracts , no matter what their other terms , are cancellable at 13-week junctures . Kate 's may be suspended , but only in case of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uninhibited 16-year-old lummox of a girl singing and doing the Charleston in Washington , D. C. amateur shows . Broadway Showman Eddie Dowling brought her to Manhattan as " Tiny Little " in Honeymoon Lane . During more than four years of Broadway ( Hit the Deck , Flying High ) , the comics of the show business treated her to so many cruel fat-lady gags that finally , bitter and hurt , she packed and went home . <P> But a phonograph recording executive named Ted Collins , believing she had better assets than her figure , put her in radio . Simplicity , Collins decided , would put her over . So her introduction became simply : " Hello everybody , this is Kate Smith " ; her farewell : " Thanks for Listenin ' . " Soon Kate was giving a fine account of herself in CBS 's then toughest spot , competing for listeners with NBC 's Amos ' n ' Andy . She dedicated programs to shut-ins , plugged firemen 's benefits , camps for underprivileged , visited cripples , became radio 's No. 1 Benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American woman " Collins last year arranged a three-a-week noonday broadcast of homely comment , book &; play criticism . Sensitive to the rising tide of Broadway patrioteering , Kate last year got Irving Berlin to write God Bless America exclusively for her , sang it week after week until last month , when it was released to other patrioteers.
