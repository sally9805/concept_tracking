txt That the fall in staple prices has been . thus far in 1930 , the outstanding economic event there will probably be no dispute . The movement as a whole has been somewhat obscured by the spectacular decline in wheat and cotton , for which there appeared to be causes peculiar to those markets . But the reduction has by no means been confined to agricultural values . Since last year 's highest prices were reached in July the general average , as computed by the Federal Labor Bureau , had declined 4% per cent by January of the present year ; the average for separate groups of commodities marking not only a decline in the six-month period of 614 per cent in farm products but of 4% per cent in nonagricultural commodities and of 4% in finished manufactures . The Bureau of Labor Statistics pointed out last Wednesday that the general average , after a further decline of nearly 1 per cent in January , was the lowest of any monthly compilation since April , 1922 . That did not mean reversion to the lowest post-war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was already under way at that date , and the average had risen something like 31/2 per cent above the lowest monthly " index number . " But the margin is not wide , and the fact that the Labor Bureau 's January average now stands about 10% per cent below the high point reached on that recovery , in November of 1925 , yields some idea of the subsequent readjustment . Decline of staple prices in foreign countries has been equally impressive . Comparison of present values with those prevailing before those nations stabilized currencies and resumed gold payments would obviously be footless . But the British Board of Trade's-compilations of prices in England show for last month an average fall of 4% per cent since last July and of 161/2 per cent since the middle of 1925 , several months after the Bank 's return to free gold payments . The averages of the Statistique Generale for France indicate 8% per cent reduction since last July and 9% since the franc had been actually stabilized at the end of 1926 . German prices are lower than at any time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this world-wide movement vary greatly ; influences bearing on changes in staple prices always do . In the United States the , fairly continuous decline in prices for manufactured goods , between 1925 and 1929 , was ascribed by the manufacturers themselves to voluntary reductions ; pursued witn a view to widening the market for " mass production " and offset by progressive economies in production . Very great extension of cultivated area and intensive cultivation , especially in Europe , go far to explain the fall in grain prices . The markets have for more than a year been talking first of all of the " unsold world carry-over " at the end of fortunate harvests . More immediately , the financial and industrial reaction of last Autumn must have had its influence . It affected Europe equally with America , reduced purchasing power through increase of unemployment , and crippled the energies of speculators who had been accumulating commodities for a possible rise in price . Still greater weight must be allowed for the recovery and increase of the world 's producing power , ever since the belligerent States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed peace . This supplemented a new producing capacity , acquired through necessity by neutral countries during wartime . Production of necessaries has now not only " caught up the slack " of the war 's diversion of normal productive energies , but has surpassed all pre-war achievement . In the far closer competition which ensued , both in the home market of producers and in their international market , the general level of prices would inevitably reflect the new conditions . Yet the re , - duction of prices since 1925 can not reasonably be considered a misfortune , any more than the much more sweeping world-wide decline could have been so regarded in the two or three decades after 1815 and 1865 . It was then an admitted basis for the new prosperity . If the course of prices complicates the present situation because of the previous readjustment of wages to post-war conditions , it also serves as a spur to production . Prices , with all their downward readjustment of the last few years , still average 40 to 50 per cult above 1914.     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
