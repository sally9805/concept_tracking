The scene is the living room in the home of PROFESSOR DOCTOR ANTON KRUG in Vienna . It is late in the afternoon of August 18th , 1930 , a date which marks the one hundredth anniversary of the birth of the late Emperor Franz Joseph I. The room is ultra-modernistic in the style of its decorations and furnishings , but there is conveyed through the colors of the curtains and upholstery a suggestion of old-fashioned warmth . At the right , down-stage , is a double door , leading to a hall and the staircase . In the up-stage right angle of the scene is a long window , looking out upon a sea of horse-chestnut trees . At the back of the room , in the centre , a few steps lead up to a little landing ; on this open the door leading to FRAU KRUG 'S boudoir and , to the left of it , the entrance to the hall which leads to the bedrooms . Up-stage left is the door leading to DR . KRUG 'S offices , and , down-stage left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slightly to the left of stage-centre is a large couch , the back of which forms a bookcase . Toward the right is a thickly upholstered easy-chair , and two or three chairs that are not so easy . There is a window seat , and between it and the landing at the back is an American radio cabinet . As the curtain rises , the stage is empty , but from the radio come the sounds of a jazz tune . After a moment , the door at the right opens and KATHIE comes in . She is a stout , competent , middle-aged servant . Behind her comes ERNEST , a venerable , jovial laundryman , bearing a brimming hamper of clean linen . KATHIE Put it down there . ( She indicates the couch , then goes up to the radio. ) p. 3 ERNEST Yes , my dear . ( He puts the laundry basket by the sofa . ) KATHIE ( muttering as she turns off the radio ) He always goes out and leaves it on when he knows it annoys the Herr Doctor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door of FRAU KRUG 'S room . ) Frau Krug . ELENA ( from off-stage ) Yes ? KATHIE The laundry 's here . ( She comes down and addresses Ernest in a peremptory tone . ) She wants to count it herself  --  and heaven help you if there 's anything missing . ERNEST Not so much as a doily , upon my word . ( ELENA comes out of her room , and walks quickly down to the couch . She is thirty-two years old , slim , serene , self-possessed and almost imperceptibly malicious . Unquestionably above reproach as the envied wife of the distinguished DR . KRUG , ELENA remains a lively subject for speculative discussion . There is no doubt that she is a lady of fashion  --  was born so , indeed  --  though she is now wearing a severely simple apron smock and appearing as a model of brisk , housewifely competence . She smiles amiably at ERNEST. ) p. 4 ELENA Good afternoon , Ernest . ERNEST ( bowing ) Frau Krug ! Good afternoon . Warming up a bit , is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , Kathie . I have the list . ( KATHIE starts taking the folded pairs of drawers from the basket , pair by pair , and putting them on the couch . ELENA holds a laundry book and pencil with which she confirms the numbers of items announced by KATHIE . ) KATHIE Seven pairs of drawers . ELENA Seven . That 's right . Here  --  let me see how they 've been done . ( KATHIE hands her a pair , which ELENA unfolds and inspects . ) ERNEST Beautifully laundered , Frau Krug , with creamy softness to caress your skin . ELENA Not my skin  --  my husband 's . ERNEST ( bowing ) Ten thousand pardons . ELENA How about the shirts ? KATHIE ( piling them up ) One  --  two  --  three  --  four  --  five  --  six  --  seven . ( DR . ANTON KRUG has come in from the left . He is a tall , powerful , handsome man of forty-five , bespectacled , correctly dressed in an essentially Teutonic morning coat with striped trousers . His hands are those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he is conscious of them . He speaks quietly , but in his deep voice is the resonance of assurance . He knows whereof he speaks ) p. 5 DR . ANTON KRUG Elena What are you doing ? ( He comes close to ELENA . ) ELENA Now do n't bother me , Anton . How many undershirts ? KATHIE Two  --  four  --  six  --  seven . ELENA Seven . That 's right . ( To ANTON ) I 'm counting the laundry . ( KATHIE begins to count out socks . ) KATHIE One pair , two  --  three  --  four  --  ( She goes on . ) DR . ANTON KRUG ( smiling ) Forgive me , Elena  --  but will this great task keep you occupied for very long ? ELENA No . Why ? DR . ANTON KRUG There are a couple of students of mine out there . KATHIE ( mumbling ) Eleven pairs socks . DR . ANTON KRUG Would you mind talking to them while they 're waiting ? I want them to have a good look at you . ELENA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . Did you say eleven ? KATHIE Yes , ma'am . Five woollen , six silk . p. 6 ELENA That 's right . I 'd better not let them see me with all this wash . DR . ANTON KRUG ( smiling ) No , it might disillusion them . They imagine you as glamorous , regal . ELENA ( interested ) Ah ! Do they ? DR . ANTON KRUG Where they got such ideas , I do n't know . ELENA Perhaps they 're very young ? ( KATHIE is putting the laundry back into the basket . ) DR . ANTON KRUG They are  --  young , and painfully earnest . They 're badly in need of a few lessons in the cultivation of grace . ELENA ( rising ) This apron is n't very glamorous , either . ( Old KRUG ambles in from the right , carrying the evening paper . He is ANTON 'S father , a gentle old man , an ex-cobbler , who does n't entirely like the way things have been going since Austria was made safe for democracy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure you can do better than that . OLD KRUG Better than what ? ELENA If you can keep them waiting a little while I shall do better . ( She goes up to the steps at the back. ) p. 7 DR . ANTON KRUG Thanks , Elena . I 'll deposit them in here . ( He goes out at the left . ) OLD KRUG Deposit who ? What 's happening ? ELENA ( at the door to her room ) Bring the laundry in here . ( She goes out , leaving the door open . ) ERNEST Gladly , Frau Krug . ( He lifts the basket . KATHIE picks up the folded drawers and shirts from the couch and goes into the room . ERNEST is following her , but old Krug intercepts him . ) OLD KRUG Oh , Ernest ! ERNEST ( turning and bowing ) Herr Krug ! OLD KRUG ( excitedly ) Have you heard any more about to-night ? ERNEST ( importantly ) I have ! I was just over at Lucher 's Hotel , and they 're in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred people ! OLD KRUG ( impressed ) A hundred ! The police are n't going to stop it , are they ? ERNEST ( with assurance ) Noooo ! Old Frau Lucher has bribed the authorities . ( KATHIE appears in the bedroom door. ) p. 8 KATHIE ( from the landing ) She told you to come in here ! ERNEST Coming ! ( He winks at KRUG , and goes out with his basket . KRUG goes over to the radio , twists the dials , then turns it on . A speech in Russian is coming through . He listens attentively . Anton comes in from the left , followed by the students , EMIL LOIBNER and ILSE HINRICH . EMIL is dark , bespectacled , poorly , carelessly dressed . ILSE might be blondly beautiful if she cared to be . She is eager and ambitious , but a trifle bewildered . ) DR . ANTON KRUG Right in here , please . ILSE I hope we 're not disturbing Frau Krug . DR . ANTON KRUG No , no ! She 's eager to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANTON KRUG ( to old KRUG ) Father ! Turn that off ! OLD KRUG But it 's that trial in Moscow . DR . ANTON KRUG Yes , and you ca n't understand a word of it . Turn it off ! OLD KRUG ( with dejected resignation ) Oh , very well . ( He does so. ) p. 9 DR . ANTON KRUG This is my father . ( ILSE and EMIL bow and murmur : " Herr Krug  --  How do you do ? " ) Two of my students  --  Ilse Hinrich and Emil Loibner . ( KRUG mumbles a churlish greeting and ambles up to the window seat whereon he sits to read his paper . ) My wife will be here in a minute . I have one more patient to see before we can begin our work . A dreadful woman ! She came all the way from  --  where is it ?  --  Pennsylvania , to learn about the more elementary facts of life . She 's married too . ( He laughs . ) What sort of husbands do you suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way to Vienna to learn the facts ? ( EMIL and ILSE laugh obediently at the Professor 's little joke . ) Now when my wife comes in I want you both to be very charming  --  rather than scientific . Do you understand that ? EMIL You do n't need to tell us that , Herr Professor . DR . ANTON KRUG Of course not . You 're already a good psychiatrist . And you too , Ilse . ILSE Oh , I do n't know anything yet . DR . ANTON KRUG You stick at it for two or three years and you 'll know everything  --  as Emil does . ( He slaps EMIL 'S shoulder and goes out at the left . Ill at ease , ILSE sits down on the edge of the couch . EMIL takes up a defensive position before the fireplace ) p. 10 ILSE What shall we say to her ? EMIL Well , I imagine we should flatter her . That 's the right thing to do . ILSE I know  --  but about what ? EMIL You ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexpectedly ) Tell her you admire this room . ILSE Oh ! ( They are both startled , having forgotten KRUG . ) OLD KRUG She likes to be praised about all this  --  decoration . ( With a none too approving sweep of the hand . ) EMIL Is it  --  is the decoration her work ? OLD KRUG Every bit of it . She stood over the carpenters and painters and told them what to do . ILSE It 's tremendously effective ! OLD KRUG Maybe . ( He rises and crosses toward ILSE . ) But as for me  --  it 's  --  I do n't know  --  I do n't like it ! It just is n't natural . Do you know what she said when she was having it done ? She said : " We wo n't have one thing in this house to look as if there ever was a past . We must believe we know nothing of what went on in the world before 1920 . We are beginning new , " she said . Crazy notions ! ( He chuckles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She can tell you young people some things that are good for you to know . And what 's more , she will tell you if you ask her the right ( ERNEST comes out of ELENA 'S room , carrying his empty basket ) p. 11 ERNEST Well , the laundry added up perfectly . OLD KRUG ( Together ) Good ! I need a clean shirt . ILSE ( in an undertone to EMIL ) ( Together ) I still do n't know what to say to her . EMIL Sh ! ERNEST And if I hear any more about that certain affair I 'll let you know . OLD KRUG Oh , please do , Ernest , because if there is a rumpus , they wo n't let the papers print anything about it . Do you think there will be a rumpus ? ERNEST ( knowingly ) Unless I miss my guess , there 'll be a good one . OLD KRUG Oh , I hope so . ERNEST Believe me , they 're eager to have Frau Krug there . ( Kathie comes out of ELENA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that . KATHIE Come on , now  --  we 're through with you . ( She crosses to the right . ) ERNEST Yes , my dear . ILSE ( to EMIL ) What was that about Frau Krug ? ( EMIL cautions her to silence. ) p. 12 OLD KRUG Good afternoon , Ernest . ERNEST Good afternoon , Herr Krug . ( He goes out at the right , followed by KATHIE . ) OLD KRUG Herr Krug ! ( He chuckles as he turns back to the students . ) He and I used to go to school together , and now he calls me " Herr " Krug . That 's because I 'm the father of my son . As if I deserved the credit . ( He comes close to ILSE . ) Do you want to know something ? ILSE About Frau Krug ? OLD KRUG ( paying no attention to her question ) I never saw what was in my boy . Neither did his mother . We wanted him to follow my trade , shoe-making . But he had big ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even when he was wearing short pants he was telling us that science was going to cure every one of everything . He was the wildest talker . EMIL Because he knew the truth . OLD KRUG Well  --  he 'd have been better off if he 'd kept his mouth closed . They did n't like to be talked about the way he talked . They punished him . ILSE Who were they ? EMIL The Habsburgs ! p. 13 ILSE Oh ! OLD KRUG Yes  --  that 's who it was . They were smart , too . Whenever things because too hot for ' em here at home they 'd start another war , and send all the worst of the trouble makers into the front line . They did that with him . They put him to work patching up all the soldiers they 'd broken there in Gorizia  --  patching ' em up so that they could send ' em out to be broken again . But do you know what he said about it ? He said it was murder they were doing  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italians ! And on top of all that , every soldier that was sent to him was marked unfit for further military service . He told ' em all to go home . But they soon put a stop to that . They took away his commission from him , and made him a laborer in their stone quarries ; and that 's why he could never be a surgeon again . They crushed his hands with their stones ! ILSE How horrible ! EMIL ( fervently ) That 's one of the crimes that we must never forget ! OLD KRUG Oh , it did n't upset him . He said , " If I ca n't use my hands to chop people to pieces , I can still use this . " ( He taps his head . ) And he did . And now they do n't put him in prison for what he says . They pay him ! Why  --  they sent for my boy all the way from America , and he went across the ocean to tell those Americans how to live . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought me a present  --  that wireless machine , there . Did you ever see as fine a one as that ? ( He gazes lovingly at the radio . ) It 's mine  --  but they wo n't let me play it . ( ELENA comes in , now wearing a graceful tea-gown. ) p. 14 ILSE Oh  --  that 's too bad ! ( EMIL signals to ILSE to behold FRAU KRUG . ) EMIL ( bowing ) Frau Krug ! ELENA ( shaking hands with ILSE , who rises ) How do you do ? ILSE ( timorously ) How do you do , Frau Krug ? ELENA Father  --  are n't you going to introduce us ? OLD KRUG I do n't know their names . They 're students . ( He goes over to the right and sits down with his pipe and his newspaper . ) ELENA ( to EMIL ) I 'm afraid I 've kept you waiting . EMIL ( stiffly ) Oh , no . We are the intruders . The Herr Professor 's with a patient . OLD KRUG It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaints . EMIL If I may say so , Frau Krug I well  --  I ( There is an awkward pause . ) ELENA Why , my dear boy  --  of course you may say anything . p. 15 EMIL Well , I it was nothing . ELENA Oh , come  --  it must have been something . You 're embarrassed . EMIL ( with a sheepish laugh ) I 'm afraid so . OLD KRUG He was going to say that he does n't believe you have any complaints , like that woman out there . EMIL I was going to say nothing of the kind ! It was something entirely different  --  a  --  a compliment  --   --  ELENA Oh  --  but that would have been the highest compliment of all ! ILSE ( nervously ) I think , Frau Krug  --  I think that Emil meant to say that we both admire the imaginativeness of this room . ELENA Oh ! I should have liked that too . Now  --  do sit down and tell me how you are getting on with your studies . ( They all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know very much yet . You see I 'm new . Emil is the Professor 's favorite . ELENA Really ! What does the Professor teach you ? ILSE Everything ! p. 16 ELENA Oh ? ILSE I mean , everything that 's worth knowing . ELENA For example ? ILSE ( lamely ) Well  --  he makes us understand that if you 'll only think right , you 'll live right . I mean  --  if you can make what 's in your subconscious come to the surface  --  then you 'll know what it is  --  and you 'll know what to do about it . EMIL ( unable longer to curb his eloquence ) No , no ! It 's infinitely more than that . He 's gone far beyond psychoanalysis . He teaches us the gospel of the better life  --  the life that is seen through the eyes of the biologist 's microscope and in the changing colors of the chemist 's test tube . He teaches us that the forward progress of man must be regulated by the statistician 's inexorable curve , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He teaches us to banish from the world all false fear of God  --  to know Him , and recognize Him only as a measurable force in cosmic technology . He teaches us to look into ourselves  --  our bodies , our minds  --  and not to the vague hills of mysticism , for the knowledge that will set us free . ELENA Well  --  that does cover about everything , does n't it ? ( She treats EMIL to a sympathetic smile . ) And when you have absorbed all the knowledge there is , what will you do with it ? p. 17 EMIL I shall try to carry it to others  --  to share it with all mankind . ELENA I see . You 're to be another Paul . EMIL Another Paul ? ELENA Yes  --  Paul ! The Apostle ! EMIL Oh  --  yes . ELENA ( to ILSE ) And how about you ? ILSE I suppose there 'll be plenty of work for all of us . EMIL ( rising ) You see , Madam  --  the world is very young . ELENA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago we were living under conditions of medivalism . ELENA Ten years ! EMIL When I look at the decaying relics of the old order , the gaunt , empty palace of the Habsburgs , and the silly monuments they erected to their own glory  --  I bless the war and the revolution that delivered us from the tyranny of ignorance . ELENA And what do you say when you look at me ? ILSE At you , Frau Krug ? What possible connection has that p. 18 ELENA I 'm one of the relics of the middle ages , of ten years ago . ( ANTON comes in from the left . ) EMIL You are the wife of the most enlightened scientist in Austria . DR . ANTON KRUG Emil ! I overheard that last remark . EMIL Yes , sir . DR . ANTON KRUG I 'm afraid you must have misunderstood me . I wanted you to flatter her , not me . ( He goes to the bookcase at the back . ) ELENA They 've been charming , both of them . DR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm glad to hear it . The one thing these students have difficulty in developing is the correct bedside manner . Is that copy of Sons and Lovers here ? ELENA I think it 's there  --  somewhere . DR . ANTON KRUG I want to give it to that Pennsylvania woman . It might help her . Ah  --  here it is . ELENA What 's the trouble with her ? DR . ANTON KRUG The usual one  --  another frustration ! For twenty years she 's been measuring her poor husband in terms of her first love  --  the one that got away . p. 19 ELENA And what are you prescribing , beside that book ? DR . ANTON KRUG She must find her first lover , and have a good look at him as he is now . He 's a manufacturer of dental supplies . I think she 'll be cured . ( He smiles at ELENA and goes out at the left . ) ELENA I hope he does help her . It must be awful to be always unsatisfied , and puzzled . EMIL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she has the capacity to understand . ELENA You worship him , do n't you ? EMIL All youth must worship him . He is leading us from the darkness  --  into the light . ELENA Do you hear that , father ? Your son is a god . OLD KRUG Yes  --  that 's what they say . ILSE Frau Krug ELENA Yes , dear . ILSE ( hesitantly ) There 's a question I 'd like to ask . You see  --  the point is that we , Emil and I  --  we know only the present , the age of reason since the Revolution . You know something of the past . p. 20 EMIL ( reproving her quietly ) Ilse ELENA That 's quite all right . Why should n't I know the past ? I 'm old enough to be your mother . ( They both protest . ) Well , practically . Now , come  --  what was the question that you want to ask ? OLD KRUG She wants you to tell her what you know of the Habsburgs . EMIL Frau Krug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scandalous gossip that evil , malicious bourgeois ELENA ( cutting in ) Oh , but you should . You want to be psychoanalysts , do n't you ? ILSE Well EMIL Of course , we do ! ELENA Then there 's every reason for you to do research work . EMIL Research work is to be done in the laboratory  --  not in the drawing-room . ELENA My dear boy  --  when you have been fully inoculated with the germ of scientific culture you will realize that all the world is your laboratory  --  and all the men and women in it merely guinea-pigs . I 'm one of them  --  and I 'm here to be explored . As a matter of fact , I 'm a peculiarly interesting specimen  --  ask my husband if I 'm not . He 'll tell you that most of his vast knowledge of human frailty comes from observation of me . ( To ILSE . ) Now , please ! Just what did you want to know ? p. 21 ILSE It would be helpful to know how you see all the changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our knowledge , or ELENA Are n't you content to take my husband 's word for it that the world has improved ? EMIL I ask for no other assurance . I need none . ELENA ( to EMIL ) I know . But  --  ( to ILSE )  --  I gather that you 're not so sure . ILSE ( tremulous ) The trouble is  --  I 'm not sure of myself . ELENA Oh ? ILSE I  --  I had an experience . ELENA Ah ! I see ! ( She draws her chair closer to ILSE . KRUG , who has been listening , draws his a bit nearer . ) Tell me about it . ILSE ( hesitantly ) It was very strange , and terribly disturbing . I 've tried to account for my emotional reaction to it , but I ca n't do it . I was in Nice on my vacation , and I called a taxi . When I was in it , I happened to look in the little mirror , above the driver 's seat , and I saw his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were the queerest eyes I 've ever seen . I kept looking at them  --  although I did n't want to . I felt sure I 'd seen him before . He was driving frightfully fast  --  on those narrow roads that run along the brinks of cliffs  --  crazily . That was n't where I wanted to go at all , but I 'd forgotten about that . I thought the cab would go over the edge any minute . Finally , I screamed out to him to stop  --  but I was so terrified that I forgot to say it in French . I spoke German . And with that he did stop , and stepped from his seat in the front and climbed into the inside of the taxi and sat down beside me . And he said , " I thought so ! There was something about your eyelids that identified you as a Viennese . I am Viennese too . In fact , I 'm one of those who imparted to Vienna its now faded glory . " Then he put his arms around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OLD KRUG ( softly ) Well  --  well  --   --  ELENA ( slowly ) A taxi-driver . ILSE He kissed me so that I could n't seem to utter a word of protest . I tried to tell myself that he was nothing more than an emotional extravert  --  but that did n't seem to help me . Then he said : " Permit me to introduce myself : I am the Archduke Rudolf Maximillian von Habsburg . " ELENA ( nodding ) Yes ! ( KRUG laughs boisterously . ELENA rises . ) Father ! ( KRUG stifles his mirth . ) EMIL I do n't believe it . It was probably some impostor . ILSE No . I asked them at the hotel when I got back . They told me he was well known in Nice . OLD KRUG How long was it before you got back ? ILSE Oh , he took me right back . You see , he 'd stopped his cab in the middle of the road , blocking traffic , and some policemen came along , so he had to remember he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KRUG Oh , dear . p. 23 EMIL ( to ILSE , in an undertone ) You 've said about enough ! ELENA What did he look like ? ILSE He looked as if he 'd stepped right out of one of those portraits in the old palace . ELENA Yes ! I know . Those full , rich lips . ILSE ( in ardent agreement ) Yes ! That 's why I thought I 'd seen him before . And when I wanted to pay him the fare , he waved it away , and said , " Nonsense , my dear  --  on this ride , you have been my guest ! " OLD KRUG I should say you had . ( He laughs . ) Just like him ! Is n't it , Elena ? Just exactly like all of them . EMIL ( vehemently ) If I had been there , I should have punched his nose . ELENA No  --  I do n't think you would have . ILSE Indeed , you would n't ! It 's all very well for you to talk  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't have been able to say a word except , " Yes , your Imperial Highness ! " ELENA ( to ILSE ) I gather that you considered the experience not entirely disagreeable . p. 24 ILSE I ca n't decide what I think about it . ELENA Have you consulted Doctor Krug ? ILSE I have n't had the courage to confess to him how weak I was . OLD KRUG You do n't have to consult him . Elena  --  you know more about these things than Anton ever will , with all his experiments . Tell them about that time when the old Emperor caught you and Rudolf Maximillian , posing on the fountain at Schnbrunn , both naked as the day you were born . ILSE ( gasping ) Oh  --  then you knew him ! OLD KRUG Knew him ! ( He ca n't contain his merriment . ) ILSE Oh  --  then I 've said something awful . EMIL Yes ! ELENA No , my dear . It was n't awful at all . I enjoyed every word of it . ( ANTON has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed away for another half hour . I was just about to give your students a lecture . DR . ANTON KRUG On what subject ? ELENA On the past . p. 25 DR . ANTON KRUG Whose ? ELENA Mine . DR . ANTON KRUG Then do n't let me interrupt . Proceed with it , at once . It 's very exciting . ELENA No , it is n't . It 's very dull . But ( to ILSE. ) you were right about one thing  --  it is instructive . And you also ( to EMIL ) were right , in all those eloquent speeches you made about the better life . Oh , Anton , you 'd have been proud of him . DR . ANTON KRUG ( smiling ) Go on with your own lecture . ELENA ( to the students ) It is a better life  --  and I can say that with authority . I was one of the many evils of the old rgime  --  I and that weird taxi-driver who entertained you in his cab . DR . ANTON KRUG What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DR . ANTON KRUG ( startled ) Here in Vienna ? ELENA No  --  in Nice . DR . ANTON KRUG ( relieved ) Oh ! p. 26 ELENA ( to ILSE ) You must tell him all about it . He 'll analyze your emotional reactions , as he analyzed mine . I needed his treatment  --  ( she looks at ANTON ; there is an exchange of understanding between them )  --  a great deal of it . He cured me  --  and I delivered myself , body and mind , to the new god . ( She puts her hand on ANTON 'S shoulder . ) You need have no doubts as to the legitimacy of that god . You can believe in him , you can worship him , you can follow him to the last statistic ! EMIL ( fervently ) Your words are inspiring , Madam ! ELENA I intended them to be . DR . ANTON KRUG Well ! All this is elevating our studies to an alarmingly high plane . ( KATHIE enters from the right , carrying a silver plate on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neophytes will step into my office , we 'll celebrate high mass . KATHIE Some callers , ma'am . OLD KRUG ( rising ) ( Together ) Who ? Who is it ? ELENA ( Together ) Just a minute , Kathie . Goodby , Ilse , and do n't worry about those emotions . They 're not uncommon . p. 27 ILSE I know  --  that 's what worries me . ( KRUG has gone to KATHIE to have a look at the cards on the plate . ) ELENA Good-by , Emil . EMIL You remember my name ! ELENA Yes , that 's one good result of my education under the Habsburgs . OLD KRUG ( excitedly ) Elena ! ELENA ( not stopping ) I was trained to remember . ( She beams upon EMIL . ) OLD KRUG Elena ! It 's the Count and Countess Von Stainz . ELENA ( startled ) Von Stainz ? ( She leaves EMIL abruptly to look at the cards . ) OLD KRUG And Frau Lucher , the old lady herself  --  and that Povoromo , that guide ELENA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ma'am . OLD KRUG Certainly they 're here , and I know why . KATHIE They 're downstairs in the hall  --  they beg to see you . p. 28 DR . ANTON KRUG ( to the students ) Will you wait in the office ? I 'll be with you in a minute . ( ILSE and EMIL go out at the left . ) OLD KRUG I can tell you exactly what they 're after ! DR . ANTON KRUG What do they want ? OLD KRUG They want her to go to that party at Lucher 's Hotel ! DR . ANTON KRUG Party ! What party ? OLD KRUG They 're having a big celebration ! There 's going to be a rumpus ! ( He is in a high state of glee at this unexpected development , but no one is paying any attention to him . ) ELENA ( to ANTON ) It 's the hundredth anniversary of the birth of that noble monarch , Franz Josef the First . Frau Lucher thought that it should be fittingly observed . OLD KRUG Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KRUG Well  --  what about it ? OLD KRUG They want Elena to go , that 's what about it ! DR . ANTON KRUG Do you want to go , Elena ? ELENA Anton ! p. 29 DR . ANTON KRUG What ? ELENA I do n't want to see these people . DR . ANTON KRUG Why not ? They 're friends of yours , are n't they ? ELENA They were , a long time ago . DR . ANTON KRUG Well , then  --  in that case  --  I ca n't see why ( He sees KATHIE . ) Wait in the hall , Kathie . KATHIE Yes , Herr Doctor . ( She goes out at the right and shuts the door . ) OLD KRUG Why do you want her to wait in the hall ? DR . ANTON KRUG If they 're old friends of yours , I ca n't see any reason why you should refuse them . Unless ELENA Unless what ? DR . ANTON KRUG Unless there might be disagreeable associations . ELENA ( with surprising vehemence ) Of course there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are dreadful people . They were two of the worst of the court toadies . DR . ANTON KRUG But what about this Povoromo ? He 's a harmless and rather pathetic professional guide . There 's nothing upsetting about p. 30 OLD KRUG But do n't you remember  --  he was one of the cronies of the Archduke . DR . ANTON KRUG And Frau Lucher  --  what 's wrong with her ? ELENA I hate her ! I hate the sight of her hotel ! DR . ANTON KRUG Why ? Because it was the scene of so many of your youthful indiscretions with him ! OLD KRUG Are you talking about Rudolf Maximillian ? DR . ANTON KRUG That damned name again ! ( He crosses to the door at the left . ) Now please , Elena  --  if you do n't want to see them , then do n't see them . But do n't ask me what to do . I have those students on my hands . I 'm very busy . ( He goes out . ) OLD KRUG Did you hear what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to get over it . ( ELENA crosses to the right . ) ELENA Kathie . KATHIE Yes , ma'am . ELENA Tell them to come up . KATHIE Yes , ma'am . OLD KRUG ( delighted ) That 's the way , Elena ! ( He sits down and makes himself entirely comfortable . ) It 'll do you good to talk to ' em . I often think you do n't see half enough of your old friends . p. 31 ELENA Go to your room , Father . OLD KRUG Why ? ELENA Because I want you to . OLD KRUG But I 'd like to have a look at them . ELENA Go on ! Please . OLD KRUG ( going ) Oh , dear ! They never let me see anything interesting that goes on in this house . ( He has shuffled out at the upper left . ) ( KATHIE returns , holding open the door . ) KATHIE In here , please . ( FRAU LUCHER comes in . She is a formidable old party , absurdly dressed in ancient clothes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unchangeably hostile , her manner toward all arrogant and despotic . Behind her come the COUNT and COUNTESS VON STAINZ and POFFY . The COUNT is about fifty-five . On his gray countenance are the ravages of time , disappointment , and drink . His courtliness , however , is unimpaired . The COUNTESS , about fifty , is dowdy and excessively emotional . POFFY is a tragic but gallant ex-officer of the Imperial Army , who is now engaged in the great work of guiding American tourists about the Hofburg . ) ELENA Tatti ! I 'm so glad p. 32 COUNTESS VON STAINZ Elena ! My angel ! My beautiful little angel ! ( She rushes into an embrace . ) ELENA ( to the COUNT , over the COUNTESS 'S shoulder ) Hello , Franz , how are you ? COUNT VON STAINZ Not very well , thank you . ( POFFY and LUCHER have hung back , as though dubious of the quality of their reception . ) ELENA I 'm so sorry . Hello , Poffy . POFFY ( bowing ) Elena ! ELENA Good afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Krug . COUNTESS VON STAINZ But , my darling ! Ten years have passed and you are not one day older . Look at her , Franz ! COUNT VON STAINZ I have been looking at her . FRAU LUCHER Would you mind if I sat down ? ( She sits , heavily , on a chair at the left . ) ELENA No . Everybody sit down . FRAU LUCHER My feet hurt . COUNTESS VON STAINZ I ca n't take my eyes off you , my little angel . You 're lovely ! I 'm about to sob ! p. 33 ELENA Now do n't be embarrassing , Tatti . FRAU LUCHER Let her sob if it 'll make her any happier . COUNT VON STAINZ Do n't mind our gaping at you , Elena . It makes us think that maybe we have n't grown old , either . ELENA Where have you been ? COUNTESS VON STAINZ In a ghastly London suburb COUNT VON STAINZ Upper Tooting , if you must know . COUNTESS VON STAINZ Breathing in English fog , eating English food COUNT VON STAINZ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer ! COUNT VON STAINZ Which reminds me , Elena  --  my throat is parched . COUNTESS VON STAINZ Franz ! COUNT VON STAINZ Would it be causing you too much trouble if I FRAU LUCHER He 's asking for a drink . ( ELENA goes up to a table on which are a decanter and some glasses . ) ELENA I have some port here  --  would port do ? p. 34 COUNT VON STAINZ Admirably ! COUNTESS VON STAINZ I told you you were not to touch a drop ! COUNT VON STAINZ We 've had a long train journey and I simply must wash the cinders from my gullet . COUNTESS VON STAINZ Elena , do n't give it to him ! ELENA Oh , a little port ca n't hurt him , Tatti . ( She hands him the glass . ) COUNT VON STAINZ Of course not . Your health , my dear . FRAU LUCHER Do you mind if I smoke ? ELENA No , have a cigarette . ( LUCHER has opened her enormous black handbag and extracted therefrom a large silver cigarcase . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes out a cigar , and bites off the end . ) ELENA Still smoking the same brand ? FRAU LUCHER No , those Cubans no longer send the cream of the crop to Vienna . ( POFFY steps forward to light the cigar . ) COUNTESS VON STAINZ There is nothing the same here . After ten years of exile  --  to find this . Oh , Elena  --  if you only knew what we 've been through . I 've been a seamstress , my darling . A seamstress ! Making sensible underwear for English frumps . We 've gone without lunch for three months in order to save enough to be here . And I give you my word , when we arrived here this morning , and drove through the streets , we wept  --  we literally wept  --  to see that our beloved Vienna is undergoing its last , gruesome agonies. p. 35 ELENA Those are n't death agonies that you see , Tatti . They 're the throes of childbirth . A new life is being created . COUNTESS VON STAINZ You may well say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The new life seems to have done well for you . ELENA Yes , it has ! ( There is , perhaps , a suggestion of defiance in this . ) COUNT VON STAINZ ( tactfully ) And by the way  --  I hope we 're to be presented to your husband . ELENA I 'm afraid he 's rather busy just now . COUNTESS VON STAINZ What 's he like , this doctor of yours ? ELENA Well  --  he 's brilliant , and charming , and kind POFFY And famous ! When I 'm guiding American tourists past here , I point with pride  --  " Residence of the eminent Dr. Krug "  --  and they 're thrilled . ELENA ( smiling ) Especially the women . POFFY Ah , yes ! FRAU LUCHER Is n't it about time to come to the main subject ? That is  --  if you all feel that there have been enough polite preliminaries . p. 36 ELENA There 's no great hurry . POFFY By all means ! Proceed , Lucher ! FRAU LUCHER Well  --  the main subject is this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mind about attending the party this evening . They begged me to come with them , and talk with you , on the supposition that I can terrorize any one into doing anything I ask . Strictly between ourselves , I do n't think you 'll be missing much if you do n't come . By the looks of this gathering , it wo n't be very COUNTESS VON STAINZ If that 's what you think , then why are you giving this party ? COUNT VON STAINZ Why have you invited us ? FRAU LUCHER Even I have my sentimental moments , Countess . When I realized that this was the hundredth anniversary , I thought that we might have a revival of the old insanity , for one evening , at my expense . I thought there might be a bit of amusement . However , I 've decided that I was overoptimistic so now you know how I feel about all this , Frau Krug , and perhaps you 'll be good enough to tell them how you feel , and get it over with . COUNT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 've looked forward so to this , and to having you there , laughing , in the way you always laughed . p. 37 ELENA But that 's just it , Franz . I could n't laugh . I 'd probably weep . COUNTESS VON STAINZ Splendid ! We 'll all weep together , and have a glorious time ! FRAU LUCHER And when you 've become sufficiently gloomy , you 'll start throwing bottles through windows . I know ! ELENA Who 's to be here ? COUNT VON STAINZ Well  --  old General Hoetzler is expected ELENA Is he ? COUNT VON STAINZ Do you know what he 's doing now ? He 's a train announcer in the railway station at Erfurt . ELENA The poor old dear . COUNTESS VON STAINZ And Talisz is coming . He 's a bookkeeper , somewhere or other . And then the two Koeppkes  --  I forget what they do . FRAU LUCHER They run a lodging house in Zermatt  --  and I 've heard ALL Yes ? FRAU LUCHER Well  --  never mind . POFFY And the beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gisella ! p. 38 POFFY She 's a governess with a Sicilian family in Palermo . ELENA And who else ? Is there anyone else ? POFFY Well  --  of course there were a good many who wanted to come but they were  --  lacking in funds . COUNT VON STAINZ Oh , but more will turn up at the last minute to help us consume Lucher 's champagne . It 's sure to be the jolliest gathering . FRAU LUCHER Did I say that champagne would be served ? COUNT VON STAINZ I have never attended a party at the Hotel Lucher without champagne . POFFY You 're thinking of the days when we paid  --  and well  --  for our drinks . ELENA Oh , I think Frau Lucher wo n't be stingy with her champagne . Will you ? COUNT VON STAINZ That 's right , Elena . You were the only one who could ever order her about . You and Rudolf . ( LUCHER bursts out laughing . ) What in God 's name are you roaring at ? FRAU LUCHER I was just thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roars of laughter . ) POFFY ( to ELENA ) I gather it was something mildly amusing . p. 39 FRAU LUCHER Oh , you remember it , Poffy  --  the night that Rudolf gave her the diamond necklace . You were there . POFFY I was indeed . FRAU LUCHER He came stalking into my caf at two o'clock in the morning  --  cursing at me  --  cursing at Strup  --  presenting medals to the bus-boys . He said he had to have a magnum of 1812 , a basket of pomegranates , and a diamond necklace for Frulein Vervesz  --  at once !  --  or he 'd break every bone in my old body . I had to rout Barnowsky the jeweler out of bed to get the diamonds . COUNT VON STAINZ ( laughing ) Served him right , the old bandit . FRAU LUCHER ( to ELENA ) And when I gave His Imperial Highness the necklace , he never said so much as a " Thank you . " He merely snatched it , and then threw it into your lap . ELENA ( to LUCHER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . He did n't give me the necklace until later , when we were upstairs . He first took hold of my hand and said , " Is n't it about time for a dance ? " Then he waltzed me out of the room , and on the way out we bumped into you . ( ANTON comes in. ) p. 40 FRAU LUCHER But I burned his neck with my cigar . ( They all laugh  --  but their mirth congeals when they see ANTON . The COUNT and POFFY rise . ) ELENA Anton , are you finished with the students already ? DR . ANTON KRUG Yes , I dismissed them . I was anxious to meet your friends . ELENA ( surprised ) Oh . This is my husband . DR . ANTON KRUG How do you do , Frau Lucher ? ELENA The Count and Countess Von Stainz  --  Herr Povoromo . ( There are murmured salutations . ) DR . ANTON KRUG Yes . I know Herr Povoromo . COUNT VON STAINZ Herr Professor Doctor  --  permit me to felicitate you upon your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most sympathetic and the loveliest of the ladies . DR . ANTON KRUG ( bowing ) I am inclined to agree with you . COUNTESS VON STAINZ Herr Professor  --  we came to beg Elena , to plead with her , to be with us this evening . COUNT VON STAINZ It is n't so much a matter of pleading  --  though we 'll do that , too , heaven knows . But we do want to assure her what a delightful occasion p. 41 FRAU LUCHER ( flatly ) The fact is that , without Frau Krug , the party will be a disaster . DR . ANTON KRUG ( amiably ) Well  --  in that case  --  I hope she 'll go . COUNTESS VON STAINZ There , Elena , that settles it ! Your husband approves . FRAU LUCHER Perhaps the Herr Professor . Doctor will also attend ? DR . ANTON KRUG Oh , that 's very kind of you , but I really could n't . I 'm afraid I should n't quite belong . ELENA I 've been afraid I should n't belong either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be great fun . COUNT VON STAINZ Good for you , Elena ! COUNTESS VON STAINZ And good for you , Herr Doctor ! You are worthy of her ! COUNT VON STAINZ You 're going to make this occasion a memorable one . FRAU LUCHER ( with an air of finality ) Well , now that that 's settled , we can go . POFFY ( stepping forward , hesitantly ) Just one minute , Elena . ELENA Yes , Poffy ? p. 42 POFFY Elena  --  I  --  think I know why you 're changing your mind . ELENA Why ? POFFY Because you realize this celebration will be nothing more than a gathering of broken-down old outcasts , like myself  --  with no one to give us animation , no one to give us the illusion of youth but I 'm afraid that it may not be quite what you expect . FRAU LUCHER What are you talking about ? POFFY ( deliberately ) I received a message this afternoon . ELENA Yes ? ( As though she had expected this . ) POFFY I was instructed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you should know about it before you go to that party ; and you too should know , Herr Professor if I might have a word with you in private COUNTESS VON STAINZ In private ? What on earth POFFY You 'll forgive me COUNT VON STAINZ ( stepping toward POFFY ) Rudolf ? ELENA He 's to be here ? p. 43 FRAU LUCHER No ! POFFY He left Nice yesterday on his way to Vienna . COUNTESS VON STAINZ Rudolf ! Count ( exultantly ) I ca n't believe it ! It 's too good to DR . ANTON KRUG Will they allow him to cross the border ? FRAU LUCHER ( emphatically ) No ! They 'll never let him in after all the things he 's said and done . The officials are so stupid that the smaller fry can sneak past them , begging your pardon , Count and Countess , but they 're not so stupid as to allow the most violent member of the Habsburg faction to get back into Austria . POFFY Regardless of all that , Elena  --  I thought you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for having mentioned the subject . DR . ANTON KRUG Not at all . There 's nothing I can say . It 's for Elena to decide . ELENA I 'm not going . COUNTESS VON STAINZ But , my little angel  --  what Lucher said is true . He could n't possibly come into the country ELENA I 'm not going ! COUNT VON STAINZ You ca n't change your mind , Elena . We need you . You 've always made things go . Have you forgotten all those times when p. 44 ELENA Yes . I have forgotten . And my dear old friends , I advise you to forget , too . COUNTESS VON STAINZ You 're asking a great deal of people who have nothing but memories to live on . ELENA That 's just it ! You 're trying to live on something that does n't exist . That 's why you 're all so degraded and spent . That 's why you have to drug yourselves with such infantile pretense as this reunion . Wallowing in sentiment ! Weeping into your beer ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartless , brutal statement  --  and from you , Elena , of all people . ELENA I know it 's brutal  --  and I feel miserable for having said it , if that 's any consolation to you . But it 's all true , every word of it . You know it is . FRAU LUCHER Of course it 's true ! I only wish you 'd said it all to me before I 'd let myself in for this nonsense . COUNTESS VON STAINZ It would have been kinder to have told your servant to deny us admission . ELENA Yes . COUNTESS VON STAINZ To have slammed the door in our faces . ELENA You 're right , Tatti. p. 45 COUNT VON STAINZ ( to Poffy ) Why did n't you have sense enough to obey orders and keep that information to yourself ? ELENA ( interrupting ) No , do n't blame him . It was very good of you to warn me , Poffy . But the warning did n't make the slightest difference . You can see why  --  and so can you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You know how changed everything is . POFFY I know , I know , my dear Elena . We 've put you in a horribly unfair position . COUNTESS VON STAINZ We 're not doing that ! It 's not our fault that she 's turned against her own kind . POFFY It 's only proof of her good sense . COUNT VON STAINZ Yes  --  and look at the results of her good sense ! And then look at us , who would n't accept the inevitable . COUNTESS VON STAINZ It 's to our everlasting credit that we did n't . ( She goes over to the COUNT , and takes his arm . ) FRAU LUCHER ( rising laboriously ) I 'm not enjoying this discussion . Come on . I must arrange about the flowers for the party . I 'm getting them second-hand from Gruen the undertaker . Good-bye , Frau Krug . Stop in at the hotel some time for a cup of coffee . ( She goes out at the right. ) p. 46 COUNTESS VON STAINZ Good-bye , Elena . I doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She goes out . ) COUNT VON STAINZ ( with attempted courtesy ) You see  --  we start the homeward journey to England to-morrow . ELENA Good-bye , Franz . COUNT VON STAINZ Herr Professor Doctor . ( He bows and goes . ) POFFY I 'm sorry , Elena  --  very sorry . ELENA Good-bye , Poffy . Come to see us again soon . Perhaps my husband can do POFFY My duties as professional guide occupy much of my time  --  but perhaps I 'll find a brief opportunity . Good-bye , Herr Doctor . Good-bye , Elena . ( He kisses her hand and goes . For a few moments , ELENA stares angrily at the door through which they have gone . ) DR . ANTON KRUG You did not appear to best advantage in that encounter . ELENA ( too heatedly ) What could I have said or done to make those imbeciles understand ? They think I could sit there , and joke with them , and drink with them , as though nothing had happened . p. 47 DR . ANTON KRUG ( gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELENA Fun ! Carousing with the Countess Von Stainz ? And there 'll be others at the party even worse than she is . DR . ANTON KRUG When I came into this room , you were laughing with them . You were just about to accept their invitation . ELENA Why did you come in here at all , if you were so colossally busy ? Why did n't you let me get rid of them by myself ? DR . ANTON KRUG I came to the conclusion that you should go to that party . ELENA What ? DR . ANTON KRUG There seems to me no reason why you should n't . ELENA ( facing him ) Are you going to carry on the attack ? DR . ANTON KRUG Attack against what ? ELENA Against my peace of mind ! DR . ANTON KRUG I thought so . ELENA Oh ! I suppose you consider that it will be good for me to go there and feel wretched and out of place , merely to assure myself that I 'm right . Do I have to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you entirely sure that you are right ? ELENA You can stand there and ask me that ? DR . ANTON KRUG If you take my advice , Elena , you 'll go . You know , you may not be quite the calm , superior being that you fancy yourself . ELENA ( interrupting ) Are you prescribing for me , as though I were DR . ANTON KRUG Yes , that 's exactly what I 'm doing . The tender spot has been uncovered . Now we can take measures to cure it . Elena , as your family physician , as well as your husband , I order you to go to Lucher 's to-night , and do the inane things you used to do , and that you still secretly think were gloriously romantic . ELENA Anton .  --  I know you 've been subjecting me to treatment ever since we were married . But you 've at least been subtle about it . Now your methods are a little too obvious to be effective . DR . ANTON KRUG I 've revised my methods because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old friends . You deliver all this fine talk about the old days and the new  --  the woman who was reborn after the revolution . And now some pitiable spectres appear to you and you ca n't bear to face them . p. 49 ELENA I can face anything , including your vast overpowering intellect . DR . ANTON KRUG There are some things you ca n't face , my darling , because you ca n't see them . You 're still in a state of emotional bondage . You 're tied to those people by a cord that 's strong even though it 's invisible . You must cut that cord  --  and here 's the chance to do it . ELENA When I require your professional services I shall make an appointment and come to your office . DR . ANTON KRUG The appointment is now ! ( They face each other through a moment of angry silence . Then ELENA goes to him . ) ELENA Oh , Anton  --  this is so silly . DR . ANTON KRUG No , it is n't silly . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) ELENA Two grown-up people , shouting at each other DR . ANTON KRUG Sometimes we have to shout . Elena  --  there 's never been a complete understanding between us . There 's been a ghost in our house , an arrogant ghost , blocking the fulfillment of our life together . A thousand different times when I thought that at last we 'd achieved the thing that we both want , he has stepped into the room , and laughed at me . ( ELENA glances involuntarily toward the door at the right. ) p. 50 ELENA The bearer of that damned name ! DR . ANTON KRUG Yes . When I heard he might be there tonight it was something of a shock . But then I thought of the advice I had given to other patients of mine . You 've seen what ten years have done to the Count and Countess Von Stainz . Well  --  see what the same years have done to him . Go to that party , have a good look at him , and then come home and admit that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anton . That 's your only fault . DR . ANTON KRUG ( laughing ) Yes  --  I 've often worried about that . ( He kisses her hair . ) Now come , my dear , dress yourself up , and try to persuade your old friends that you 're still one of them . Sing , dance , flirt  --  relax ! Let yourself go completely ! And see what happens . ELENA Let myself go . Is that the prescription ? DR . ANTON KRUG Why not ? ( Old KRUG bustles in from the upper left . ) OLD KRUG Well  --  I saw them ! I had a good look at them from the window  --  and a more down-at-the-heel lot I never clapped eyes on . Oh , I laughed ! I laughed when I thought of the old days when p. 51 DR . ANTON KRUG You talk too much . ( He has risen and is going toward the door to his offices . ) OLD KRUG Then maybe I can play the wireless ? DR . ANTON KRUG No . ( To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know  --  the one you got in Paris . You look lovely in that . ( He goes out at the left . ) OLD KRUG ( mystified ) He wants you to dress up . What for ? Does he want you to go to the party ? ( He comes close to her . ) ELENA He 's a little mixed up . He has me confused with that last patient of his  --  the one from Pennsylvania . OLD KRUG I do n't understand what you mean , Elena . Has anything gone wrong ? ELENA No , father . Not yet . Why do n't you play the wireless ? OLD KRUG Now ? ELENA Yes , dear  --  I want to hear it . OLD KRUG Ah , Elena  --  you 're my friend ! ( He leans over her . She pats his cheek , tenderly . He then turns , happily , goes up to the radio , and switches it on . It is playing " The Dollar Princess Waltz . " ) p. 52 OLD KRUG Listen , Elena . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old tunes , for a half hour before supper  --  to give us old-timers an appetite . It 's beautiful , is n't it ? ( He comes down , toward the right . ) ELENA No . ( Nevertheless , she is swaying ever so slightly in time to the music . Old KRUG watches her , fascinated . At length she rises , crosses to the door at the left , and knocks . KRUG sits down at the right to await developments . ) ELENA ( calling ) Anton ! OLD KRUG Oh , what do you want him for ? He 'll only make us turn it off . ( ANTON appears in the doorway . ) DR . ANTON KRUG What is it ? ELENA Will you please look in the safe  --  in my jewel box ? There 's a necklace there  --  a diamond necklace . DR . ANTON KRUG I 'll get it . ( He goes out . ) ( Swaying more perceptibly , exuberantly , to the rhythm of " The Dollar Princess , " she crosses to the chair where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean what you said , about the music , did you , Elena ? It really is beautiful , is n't it ? p. 53 ELENA Yes , father . Beautiful . ( She extends her arms . Gleefully , he jumps up . They waltz together. ) @x The scene is a private room upstairs in the Hotel Lucher , a stuffy edifice built in the gas-lit ' Eighties . Although redolent of stale plush , which is suggestive to the Anglo-Saxon mind of Victorianism and therefore of dreary propriety , this venerable tavern retains a winked intimation of Viennese caprice . Its sombre salons can still sparkle with happy imaginings of frivolities which no longer are  --  and perhaps never were  --  but which eternally should be . At right , downstage , is a leather swinging door , leading to the pantries and kitchens . Upstage right and left are two more doors . In the centre , at the back , double doors open upon a bedroom in which is an enormous , canopied bed . Downstage left , double doors open upon a larger room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door at the back , which is two or three steps up from the level of the stage , is hung an oval portrait of the late Emperor Franz Josef I. A PORTER , on a step-ladder , is arranging laurel festoons about this portrait . Another PORTER is holding the ladder . At the left is a gilded couch with plum-colored brocade upholstery . By it is a small gilded , marble-topped tabouret . At the right is a round table , also marble-topped , behind which , as though enthroned , sits FRAU LUCHER , administering orders to a respectful , palpitant group which includes STRUP , the aged head-waiter , and BREDZI , the band-leader , who is wearing a frogged green coat and is carrying his violin . He has given LUCHER the programme of selections for the evening and is awaiting her verdict on it . There are also present two lesser WAITERS and two quivering BUS-BOYS . A BELL-BOY is posted in the doorway at the left . There are other chairs against the walls and perhaps a few potted palms . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brisk march , as vigorously as its meagre equipment and talents will allow . FRAU LUCHER ( to BREDZI ) There is too much of the Mozart . p. 55 BREDZI No doubt , Frau Lucher . FRAU LUCHER No doubt whatever . They will want waltzes , apassionata , until they get drunk , and then they will want more waltzes . Sentimental ninnies ! ( She hands the programme back to BREDZI . ) They will want to weep on each others ' shoulders . You understand ? BREDZI Perfectly , ma'am . FRAU LUCHER Accompaniment for sobs  --  that 's all that 's expected of you . ( Her cigar has gone out . A BUS-BOY hastily strikes a match for her . She exhales a cloud of smoke , then turns to STRUP . ) Now , Strup , I 'm ready for the wines . ( STRUP hands her the wine card . ) STRUP ( pridefully ) I have arranged everything . FRAU LUCHER Oh , have you ! ( She scans the wine card with a practised eye . ) Champagne ! Cliquot 1911 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? STRUP It 's the best we have , madam . FRAU LUCHER And you 're granting them the best ! STRUP It is a matter of tradition . FRAU LUCHER So ? You 're putting tradition ahead of common sense , are you ? p. 56 STRUP ( fearfully ) It is n't that , Frau Lucher , I only felt that FRAU LUCHER ( slapping the table ) The employees of this hotel will take their notions of tradition and of everything else from me ! ( She includes all of them in the same decisive glare . ) You will serve Tizane with the roast  --  a half bottle for each of them . When they 've guzzled that much , nothing but beer . Vienna beer , not Muenchner . STRUP Very good , ma'am . FRAU LUCHER A sage observation , Herr Strup . Now , all of you , remember this : Courtesy , deference  --  treat them as if they were still lords of creation and as if you expected heavy tips for your services , which , I promise you , you wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonsense , from all of you  --  until they start breaking the furniture  --  then , a firm hand ! If you ca n't manage them by yourselves , send for me . STRUP Yes , ma'am . We shall , ma'am . FRAU LUCHER You will serve the aperitifs in here . That is all . STRUP Yes , ma'am . To your posts , march ! ( The WAITERS and BUS-BOYS hurry out . LUCHER turns her attention to the men at the ladder. ) p. 57 FRAU LUCHER You ! You have done enough fussing with the Emperor . Get that ladder out of here . ( Hastily , they fold up the ladder and depart . A BELL-BOY appears in the large door at the right , ushering in POFFY , now wearing a once-resplendent uniform which reeks of moth-balls and naphtha . ) BELLBOY Herr Povoromo ! STRUP ( bowing low ) Herr Baron . POFFY ( mildly astonished ) What ? Oh ! I 'm greatly obliged for the restoration of the title . ( He bows to STRUP . ) FRAU LUCHER Are they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order . STRUP Yes , Herr Baron . ( BREDZI and STRUP go out at the left . POFFY advances jauntily toward LUCHER . ) POFFY I came to see you about the final arrangements . FRAU LUCHER The final arrangements are made . ( The march music offstage stops . ) POFFY In particular reference to the wine p. 58 FRAU LUCHER ( consulting her list ) With the soup , sherry  --  nine schillings . With the trout , Grinzinger  --  seven schillings . With the roast , Tizane  --  nine schillings . POFFY ( shocked ) Tizane ! Is that the best that this superior establishment can afford ? FRAU LUCHER On this occasion , yes . POFFY There will be complaints . FRAU LUCHER You people are not paying for this affair . I am . POFFY We are aware of that condition . Nevertheless  --  I must insist  --  there will be complaints . FRAU LUCHER Did that message you received say what time he would arrive ? POFFY I expected him on the afternoon train from Salzburg . But he was not on it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . It is now half after eight . POFFY There will be another train . FRAU LUCHER Yes  --  and he wo n't be on that , either . It 's just as I thought . They 've stopped him at the border . Are there any unexpected arrivals ? p. 59 POFFY No . Here 's the complete list . Only eight names instead of the expected thirty . ( POFFY takes the list from his pocket . ) FRAU LUCHER Let me see it . ( He hands it to her . TORLINI , the hotel 's courier , enters from the upper left , accompanied by an officer of police . ) TORLINI Frau Lucher ! FRAU LUCHER Yes ? TORLINI The police , ma'am . ( LUCHER is not in the least disturbed by this announcement . She is examining critically the list of guests . ) FRAU LUCHER ( to the POLICEMAN ) What do you want ? POLICEMAN The Herr Inspector thought it might be as well for me to have a look around . FRAU LUCHER Go ahead and look . You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nods and looks about the room , paying special attention to the portrait of Franz Josef . ) POFFY Surely , for only eight , you could afford Mot et Chandon , at the least . FRAU LUCHER No . There 's not one on this list with a palate left to his name . The bottles of Tizane will be wrapped in napkins . No one will know the difference . p. 60 POFFY ( bowing ) As you say , my dear hostess . FRAU LUCHER Exactly as I say ! ( She hands him back the list . The POLICEMAN is at the large door at the left . ) POLICEMAN ( pointing off to the left ) Will the reception be held in there ? FRAU LUCHER Yes . And it will be kept in there . ( The POLICEMAN steps out at the left . LUCHER speaks in an undertone to POFFY . ) If he had arrived it would have been different . I would have served the best . I 'd even have done it if she had consented to come . But for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POFFY She was right , of course . She 'd have had a poor time . FRAU LUCHER Yes . She was right . But I 'd like to have heard what the great psychologist said to her after we left . ( The POLICEMAN has returned . ) POLICEMAN Who is to be present at this function ? POFFY Here is the list . ( He hands the list to the POLICEMAN , then turns to LUCHER . ) And if he can find any cause for excitement in that group , then perhaps it may be a good party , after all . p. 61 POLICEMAN Is this all ? FRAU LUCHER That is all , and as I informed the inspector  --  there 'll be no one of the slightest importance here to-night . ( Having looked over the list , the POLICEMAN sticks it in the large note-book which he carries in a breast pocket . ) POLICEMAN If you do n't mind , I think I 'll have a look at these guests of yours and make certain that this list is correct . FRAU LUCHER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm only being careful . ( He turns to the left and starts to go out . ) POFFY Perhaps you 'd like me to present them to you formally . ( He and the POLICEMAN go out at the left . ) FRAU LUCHER Torlini , give that policeman a drink . TORLINI Yes , ma'am . ( He goes off at the left . FRAU LUCHER opens her hand-bag and takes therefrom a note-book and gold pencil . She is leaning over the little marble-topped table at the left , figuring out the cost of this affair . The aged CHEF rushes in from the right . He is in a state of terrific perturbation , as is a WAITER , who follows him. ) p. 62 CHEF Frau Lucher ! FRAU LUCHER ( calmly ) Well  --  what is it ? ( Her back is toward the CHEF so that she does not see him bow low as the ARCHDUKE RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN comes in from the right . . RUDOLF is tall , lean , deliberately ominous , consciously mad  --  an ageless prince who , despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wears , brings back with him into the Hotel Lucher the semblance of imperial splendor which it had known when such outrageous beings as he were lords of Vienna . He is followed by a WAITER and two BUS-BOYS , who carry his cape , haversack , blanket roll and sword holster . Even these BUS-BOYS , who were infants when the House of Habsburg fell  --  even they are awestruck , trepidant in the presence of a magnificence which they have been rigorously taught to scorn . RUDOLF crosses to LUCHER and administers a loving whack to her ample bottom . ) RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Good evening , venerable strumpet . ( LUCHER turns , stares at him , mutters some blasphemous exclamation of dismay , curtseys involuntarily , then rushes to the doors at the left and shuts them . RUDOLF follows her . ) RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Still wearing the red flannel drawers ? ( He lifts her skirts from behind . ) Thank God , there 's something in Vienna that has n't been changed . p. 63 FRAU LUCHER ( ferociously ) How did you come here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall not describe in detail . My entrance to the hotel was made through the kitchens  --  and whatever appetite I may have had is now gone . You received no letter from me ? FRAU LUCHER No . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Good ! I wrote none . ( He strolls toward the right , pauses , and sniffs . ) There 's the same nauseating stench of fish in this hotel . By God  --  I believe it 's the same fish ! FRAU LUCHER Do they know ? RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Who are they ? FRAU LUCHER Poffy  --  Count von Stainz  --  Hoetzler RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Is it necessary for me to advise them of my intentions ? Is it ? FRAU LUCHER They will be startled . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN As they should be ! I will occupy the Imperial Suite FRAU LUCHER The Imperial Suite no longer exists . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Restore it ! p. 64 FRAU LUCHER ( to the BUS-BOYS ) Is that his luggage ? BUS-BOYS ( eagerly ) Yes , Frau Lucher . We were commanded to CHEF Yes , Frau Lucher . His Imperial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Put it in there . ( She indicates the door at the back . The CHEF motions to the two BOYS who hustle out as directed . The WAITER goes with them . ) Do you happen to know that the police are in the building ? RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN You ! Were you addressing the chef ? FRAU LUCHER ( grudgingly ) Your Imperial Highness . ( To the CHEF . ) You may go . ( The CHEF starts to go out at the right . ) RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Wait ! ( The CHEF stops , and bows . ) You recognized me , did n't you ? CHEF ( pleased ) Yes , Your Serene Highness . ( He bows again . ) RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN You did not recognize me . I am travelling incognito . p. 65 CHEF ( bowing ) Yes , Your Serene Highness . ( He goes out at the right . ) FRAU LUCHER If your memory were better , you would remember that this was the Imperial Suite . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( looking about the room ) By God , it is ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , then sits in the chair back of the table at the right and starts to take off his shoes . The WAITER comes out of the room at the back , followed by the BUS-BOYS ) . I want some brandy . FRAU LUCHER Brandy . WAITER ( bowing ) At once , Your Serene Highness . ( He goes . RUDOLF is shaking some pebbles from one of his shoes into an ash-tray on the table . ) RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN A cigarette . FRAU LUCHER Cigarette ! ( One of the BUS-BOYS places a cigarette between RUDOLF 'S " full , rich lips . " The other boy lights it . ) BUS-BOYS ( bowing together ) Your Serene Highness . ( They scurry out at the right . RUDOLF exhales a huge cloud of smoke . Then he laughs. ) p. 66 RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN It 's incredible ! I believe that even the aged worms in your woodwork recognize me , and are thrilled by my return . I do n't blame them  --  after all these years with nothing to do but sit back and watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decrepit establishment going ? FRAU LUCHER We have plenty of trade . ( The WAITER comes in with a tray on which is a bottle of brandy and one enormous glass , which he puts on the table . ) RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Loud-mouthed American tourists , I suppose . FRAU LUCHER Yes ! They flock here to ogle the scenes of your triumphs . ( She is pouring a drink of brandy . ) RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Disgusting ! FRAU LUCHER ( to the WAITER ) Tell Torlini I want to see him . WAITER Yes , Frau Lucher . ( The WAITER goes out at the left . ) RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN I find the whole aspect of this place depressing , and at the same time , rather gratifying . FRAU LUCHER ( interrupting him ) Now , I was n't joking when I warned you about the police . p. 67 RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( through her speech ) Will you please not talk when I 'm speaking ? Sit down ! ( Under protest , LUCHER has stopped talking and sits down across the table from him . ) Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is like a corpse that twitches with the reflexes of life  --  a gruesome spectacle . I do n't envy you , Lucher , having to abide here among the remains . I did n't really mean that . I do envy you . ( He gulps some brandy . ) They drained the blood from Vienna when they removed us  --  and now observe the results ! Serves the swine right . ( Another gulp . ) FRAU LUCHER Do you wish to change your clothes ? RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Naturally , I do n't intend to exhibit myself in this outlandish costume . FRAU LUCHER ( rising ) Then you had better go in there , and stay in there , till I can get rid of the police . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Sit down ! ( Subduing several choice oaths , she again sits . ) Who is here , besides Poffy and that senile incompetent , General Hoetzler ? FRAU LUCHER The Baroness von Krett , and Koeppke and his wife , and Talisz p. 68 RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN And Elena Vervesz . She is here , too . FRAU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LUCHER She is not coming ! RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN What ? She is not in Vienna ? FRAU LUCHER Yes  --  but she has flatly refused to come ! RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Oh ! She did n't know I would be here . Married , is n't she ? FRAU LUCHER Yes . To a doctor  --  a very important doctor . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN I have a distinct feeling that he will be called out to-night , to some distant place  --  an emergency case . Have you seen her lately ? FRAU LUCHER I went to her house to-day . ( The orchestra starts offstage , playing the opening bars of " The Blue Danube . " ) RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN How is she ? Old ? FRAU LUCHER No . ( Reminded by the music that the door is open , she rises and starts over toward the left . ) RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Does she bulge ? ( LUCHER does not answer . He roars . ) Does she bulge ? ( LUCHER turns to him . ) Here ? ( He indicates breasts. ) p. 69 FRAU LUCHER No ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the music can now be heard only faintly . ) RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Send for her . FRAU LUCHER She will not come . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Tell her that her one true lover has condescended to be present . FRAU LUCHER I tell you , she will not come ! RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( rising suddenly ) And I am telling you that she will come ! FRAU LUCHER She has a different life now RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( advancing ) If by any chance she should not be here when I am ready ( He takes hold of her throat . ) But you know the consequences  --  do n't you , old filthy ? You know ! ( He laughs , gives her a playful shake , and kisses her . ) FRAU LUCHER ( through his kisses ) There is something else in Vienna that is not changed . You ! You are the same maniac  --  like all your wretched family . ( RUDOLF laughs , releases her , and walks over to the table at the right. ) p. 70 RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN No  --  not a maniac . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charm . ( He starts to yodel . He picks up the bottle and glass , also his green Tyrolean hat . ) I want a valet . ( He puts on his hat and crosses to LUCHER . ) Tell Elena to take all the time she wants . I do n't approve of women who jump into their clothes like fire-horses . She must make every possible effort to look alluring . ( He pinches her and strolls off yodelling into the bedroom at the back . He starts to remove his clothes . LUCHER nervously rushes up with unusual alacrity and closes the doors after him . Then she crosses to the doors at the left , opens them , and calls : ) FRAU LUCHER Strup ! ( The music is playing loudly . ) Strup ! STRUP ( from offstage ) Yes , Frau Lucher . ( He hurries in . ) FRAU LUCHER ( in measured tones ) You will take the Tizane off the ice . We will serve champagne  --  Cliquot 1911 . STRUP What ? FRAU LUCHER Did you hear ! STRUP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly to the table at the right. ) p. 71 FRAU LUCHER Yes , and there will be nine covers , instead of eight . Have them get that big chair that 's in the office  --  that gold chair . ( TORLINI has appeared in the doorway , followed by the POLICEMAN , whom LUCHER does not at first see . ) STRUP Yes , ma'am . Nine covers . ( Hearing this , the POLICEMAN takes out his note-book and the list of guests which POFFY had given him . ) FRAU LUCHER Put the gold chair at the head of the table . And I want caviar served . TORLINI You sent for me , Frau Lucher ? FRAU LUCHER Yes , I did . ( She sees the POLICEMAN . ) But it 's POLICEMAN Nine covers ? There are only eight here . FRAU LUCHER I neglected to count myself . I am to attend the party . POLICEMAN The gold chair will be for you ? FRAU LUCHER Why not ? It 's my hotel , is n't it ? Go on , Strup , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the left . LUCHER goes close to TORLINI . ) FRAU LUCHER I want to send a message  --  ( The POLICEMAN is evincing interest . LUCHER is frantically attempting to signal to TORLINI to get rid of the POLICEMAN )  --  to the florist 's . The flowers they sent are all wilted . ( The POLICEMAN is watching too closely  --  LUCHER goes over to him , fire in her eye . ) And as for you  --  I 'd be grateful if you 'd go straight to the Herr Inspector and tell him that I consider this intrusion by the police an unpardonable outrage ! Do you hear that ? p. 72 POLICEMAN Yes  --  Frau Lucher . I hear . But surely you 'll agree that the police must be FRAU LUCHER ( shouting ) I 'll agree to nothing ! I 've taken great pains to explain this whole affair to the authorities and they assured me that there would be no interference . POLICEMAN I only know that I have been ordered to look in here , and FRAU LUCHER And you 've obeyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've seen everything and satisfied yourself that nothing harmful can come of this . It 's all ridiculous stupidity , typical of the brainless asses who govern this city . ( She has fished some bills from her hand-bag . ) Here , my good man . ( She hands the money to him . ) Now run along to the inspector , and present to him my sincerest compliments . ( She pushes him toward the door . ) POLICEMAN I will , Frau Lucher ! ( He pockets the money . ) And if he sends me back , it wo n't be my fault . FRAU LUCHER I know that . Go on . ( She pushes him out , then addresses TORLINI , rapidly , in a furious undertone . ) See that that policeman gets out of the hotel . Then telephone to Dr. Anton Krug 's house , and tell Frau Krug that the worst has happened ! p. 73 TORLINI The worst ? FRAU LUCHER She 'll understand . Tell her to get into a car and drive out of Vienna just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But what about the florist ? FRAU LUCHER ( at the top of her lungs ) Great God ! Never mind the florist ! ( The door at the back opens , and RUDOLF appears wearing his shirt and nothing else . ) RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Where in hell is that valet ? FRAU LUCHER Get back in that room ! TORLINI ( staring at RUDOLF ) It is impossible ! FRAU LUCHER I told you to stay in RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Is there such a thing as a valet in this brothel ? FRAU LUCHER Yes , he 's coming right up . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Thank you , my sweet . ( He pinches her cheek . ) TORLINI ( bowing low ) Your Imperial Highness . ( RUDOLF reaches out and lifts TORLINI 'S bowed head. ) p. 74 RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN I do not remember who you are  --  nevertheless , good evening . ( He bows to TORLINI , then turns and walks back with great dignity , albeit without trousers , into his room . LUCHER slams the door behind him . ) FRAU LUCHER Now do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trembling ) I do . FRAU LUCHER Tell her he 's here . When he finds out she is n't in this hotel , there 'll be an uproar . He 'll go after her . He 'll break into her house , and have a fight with her husband . If she wants to avoid a nasty scene , she 'll have to get herself out of the city , at once . ( The COUNT has come in from the left . He is carrying a cocktail glass . TORLINI goes . ) COUNT VON STAINZ Now let me tell you something , Frau Lucher : I just happened to take a look under the napkin in one of the ice buckets , and what did I see there ? Tizane  --  that 's what I saw ! Tizane  --  sparkling dishwater ! ( LUCHER has been gathering up the papers from the table and stuffing them back into her hand-bag . She darts one look at the COUNT . ) FRAU LUCHER You 're drunk already . p. 75 COUNT VON STAINZ Oh , now , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been easy for us to come here , you know . If you had the heart to invite us here , I should think you 'd have the decency to furnish us with wine that is at least potable . ( LUCHER , however , has gone out at the right . GISELLA VON KRETT has come in from the left . She was once one of the haughtier beauties of the court . She is now a wasted , embittered governess , clinging grimly to the sense of snobbery which is all that she managed to salvage from the wreckage of the past . She is wearing an evening gown which was fashionable in 1917 . ) GISELLA Well ? Did you tell her we insisted on champagne ? COUNT VON STAINZ Yes , but she did n't seem to hear me . ( GISELLA sits down at the left . ) GISELLA We should have known that this would happen . She dragged us here solely to humiliate us for the satisfaction of her own vulgarian sense of inferiority . COUNT VON STAINZ Ah , well , my dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean to say , after the first three glasses you hardly know what you 're drinking . I shall consume the first three glasses rapidly . GENERAL HOETZLER ( from offstage ) I hurled in the 19th army corps  --  or was it the 17th ? ( He enters from the left with SOPHIA KOEPPKE on his arm . ) And in another twelve hours we 'd have smashed the Russian line . ( He sees the COUNT . ) Franz ! p. 76 COUNT VON STAINZ General Hoetzler ! ( They bow formally and shake hands . The old GENERAL is still fat but obviously shrunken ; he has n't flesh enough left to fill his skin . He wears a uniform coat , which is too large for him by many years , but moths have deprived him of the trousers that go with it and he is forced to wear a pair from his gray civilian suit . In spite of which , he is wilfully hearty , and determined to make this a gay and care-free celebration . SOPHIA is a faded blonde , buxom and  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flagrantly girlish . ) GENERAL HOETZLER This is splendid , old boy . SOPHIA ( who has gone over to GISELLA ) My darling Gisella ! How stunning you look ! GISELLA ( without emotion ) Good evening , Sophia . GENERAL HOETZLER Gisella ! Smart , distinguished , entrancing as ever ! SOPHIA Now you must all be quiet , because dear General Hoetzler is telling me the most thrilling story about the campaign in 1915 . COUNT VON STAINZ Oh , yes , indeed  --  I remember it well . You had the Russians in a tight corner  --  eh , General ? Now do sit down , Sophia . ( She sits down at the right . Offended at this abrupt dismissal of his favorite reminiscence , the GENERAL makes an attempt to continue. ) p. 77 GENERAL HOETZLER I was trying to explain to Sophia how curious it was that , at the very moment of complete triumph ( But the COUNT has his back turned . ) COUNT VON STAINZ ( to SOPHIA ) I ca n't tell you what a delightful privilege it is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrilly ) Oh , Franz  --  you 're much too gallant . COUNT VON STAINZ With provocation , my dear . SOPHIA But Koeppke and I do try to keep up appearances , even in the hopelessly middle-class atmosphere of Switzerland . COUNT VON STAINZ As Tatti and I do , in Upper Tooting . But it 's an endless struggle . SOPHIA Dreadful ! People do n't seem to understand the importance of those things any more . There are so many false standards . COUNT VON STAINZ That 's it ! That 's precisely it ! ( During all this , HOETZLER has sat down on the couch beside GISELLA , and is carrying on manfully with his narrative . ) GENERAL HOETZLER I was just telling Sophia of the time early in 1915 when we had the Russians on the run . We were within that of breaking through the enemy 's line ; and they had no more than a corporal 's guard in reserve . You can readily imagine the consequences . We 'd have marched on to Petersburg , crushed the Russian Empire ! But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached a climax ( By this time the COUNT has said " That 's precisely it ! " and has been compelled , by the loudness of HOETZLER 'S voice , to turn to listen . ) I received a telegram from Prince Max in Berlin telling me to withdraw ! Now I ask you , I ask all of you , what was I to do ? p. 78 COUNT VON STAINZ Withdraw . GENERAL HOETZLER Exactly . And the baffling part of it all is that that telegram from Berlin has never been adequately explained . And I can tell you , my dear Gisella COUNTESS VON STAINZ ( from offstage ) They 're all in here . ( The COUNTESS and TALISZ come in , arm in arm . She is now wearing an evening dress , of her own manufacture , and there is an ostrich plume or so in her hair . TALISZ is very old , somewhat bemused and slightly deaf . He is wearing a frayed swallow-tail coat , lustreless , black satin knee breeches , and black cotton stockings borrowed from his landlady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very courtly . ) COUNTESS VON STAINZ Gisella ! Sophia ! Well ! SOPHIA Well ! GISELLA ( acidly ) The General is telling us about a telegram from Berlin . GENERAL HOETZLER I was merely explaining that there was a certain faction in Prussia headed by Hindenburg that did not wish Austria to achieve TALISZ ( to SOPHIA ) And where is Koeppke ? I do n't see him . Is n't he to be with us ? ( The COUNTESS takes his arm and indicates that he has interrupted the GENERAL. ) p. 79 GENERAL HOETZLER ( giving TALISZ an angry look ) There can be no question of doubt that Hindenburg was jealous of the inevitable result of my coup . He knew my victory would destroy the Russian power and Austria would gain the credit for having won the war . TALISZ ( who does n't quite know what 's happening ) Is His Imperial Highness here yet ? SOPHIA No . Poffy 's out now trying to find out if there 's any word of him . TALISZ I beg your pardon ? COUNTESS VON STAINZ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Poffy 's out now trying to find out if there 's any word of him . " TALISZ Oh , yes , I knew that . I felt sure he 'd come . GENERAL HOETZLER Hindenburg , of course , was a Prussian of the Prussians  --  contemptuous of Austria , determined to TALISZ What 's the General saying ? COUNTESS VON STAINZ Something about the war . TALISZ Oh ! Too bad . ( He moves away . Nettled by the frequent interruptions , HOETZLER makes a supreme attempt to complete his story. ) p. 80 GENERAL HOETZLER I knew it at the time , but my obligations as a soldier to our allies compelled me to silence . Hindenburg blocked my plans and then deliberately stole them ! Stole them  --  and used them himself in the Masurian Lakes region ! That , my friends , is the true explanation of ( POFFY enters . The COUNT , COUNTESS and SOPHIA rush over to question him . ) SOPHIA Poffy , is there any news ? COUNT VON STAINZ What about Rudolf ? Is he coming ? POFFY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he was n't on it . COUNTESS VON STAINZ Oh ! I ca n't bear to think they 've caught him . ( She is apparently on the verge of tears , her favorite perch . ) SOPHIA He must come . He must ! POFFY Of course with Rudolf there is always hope . GENERAL HOETZLER Of course there is hope . Rudolf was always late . Do you remember the time , my dear Gisella , when the Emperor was holding a reception for King Edward VII ? GISELLA No . ( STRUP has come in , followed by two WAITERS with trays loaded with glasses of tepid vermouth. ) p. 81 STRUP ( speaking through HOETZLER 'S lines ) Herr Baron , the aperitifs ! POFFY By all means proceed with them . STRUP Thank you , Herr Baron . ( The service of the aperitifs proceeds , under STRUP 'S benign supervision , while HOETZLER continues with his reminiscence about the reception for King Edward VII . ) GENERAL HOETZLER ( taking GISELLA 'S " No " as cue ) Matters of the utmost importance were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the royal family to be most punctual . And of course they all were  --  with one exception . ( The WAITER offers HOETZLER a drink , which he takes , and then continues : ) With one exception  --  Rudolf . He was a mere stripling then , but even so , he kept the King of England waiting for two hours while he ( The VALET has come in from the right and gone up to the bedroom door . He knocks . ) RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( from within ) Come in . GENERAL HOETZLER Who 's in that room ? SOPHIA ( archly ) Now  --  now , General ! p. 82 GENERAL HOETZLER But if there 's anybody spying on us POFFY He 'll be bitterly disappointed . Now if you will all be good enough to rise . ( They all rise . POFFY turns and lifts his glass to the portrait of Franz Josef . ) To His Imperial Majesty ! ( They all drink and then give silent , facial testimony to the low quality of the vermouth . The oppressive silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a brisk , obtrusive little man who , like his wife , SOPHIA , is too well nourished . ) KOEPPKE ( breezily ) Well , here I am ! SOPHIA You 're late . KOEPPKE Yes , my love . ( He looks about . ) Is the party in full swing ? GISELLA It is . POFFY Oh , come  --  let 's go in to dinner . GISELLA I 've lost my appetite . That loathsome vermouth POFFY I know , my dear Gisella , you 're accustomed to the best in Palermo . As for the rest of us , we have come here to conduct a celebration . It is going to be a difficult task , but I strongly urge that we all smother our justifiable grievances and pretend to be having a very devil of an uproarious carousal . Let us close our eyes to the fact that we all look a bit moth-eaten and concentrate on getting through this with a show of good grace . ( The COUNT starts to sing : " Vilya , oh , Vilya , the witch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not going to be very uproarious on Tizane . GENERAL HOETZLER I beg of you , Gisella , be quiet . SOPHIA ( referring to the COUNT 'S song ) That 's a cheerful selection ! GISELLA ( to POFFY ) If you 'd only taken the trouble to let us know what it would be like COUNTESS VON STAINZ It was n't Poffy 's fault . KOEPPKE Personally I 'm in favor of abandoning the whole thing . ( The COUNTESS has started to weep . SOPHIA is trying to calm her . The COUNT is slumped in a chair at the left , still singing " Vilya . " GISELLA is seated at the right , regarding the COUNTESS with disgust . HOETZLER and TALISZ are behind her . POFFY has gone out at the left to beg the musicians for God 's sake to play something lively . KOEPPKE is hovering over the couch , patronizing the COUNTESS . The following speeches are delivered in a jumble : ) SOPHIA I wish to heaven you 'd all listen to Poffy . At least we can pretend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tatti , you wo n't help matters at all by crying your eyes out p. 84 GENERAL HOETZLER Perhaps if Lucher would give us some really good beer it might take effect more quickly . TALISZ ( to HOETZLER ) What 's everybody saying now ? KOEPPKE ( to the COUNTESS and SOPHIA ) I 'll tell you what . How about the three of us slipping down to the bar and having a few brandies ? Just the three of us . Oh , do n't worry  --  I can pay for them . I 've over a hundred and fifty real marks in my pocket at this moment ! ( ELENA has entered on the cue from TALISZ : " What 's everybody saying now ? " She comes down from the upper right , so that TALISZ and HOETZLER see her first . ) ELENA Talisz ! I did so hope you 'd be here . And the dear General . How sweet it is to see you . TALISZ Elena ! Elena ! ( He kisses her hand . ) GENERAL HOETZLER Elena , is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELENA , and fairly whoops for joy . ) POFFY Elena ! ( The others are now aware of her presence . They cease their chattering , weeping and singing , and form a hilarious , welcoming group about her. ) p. 85 ELENA Tatti ! You should have known . I could n't keep away . And Sophia ! How charming you look ! And Koeppke ! I ca n't believe it ! Hello , Franz  --  you knew I 'd be here , did n't you ! COUNT VON STAINZ A good joke on us ! A capital joke ! Just like you , Elena . Bring some more drinks . Herr Ober ! Herr Ober ! ( The COUNT rushes out at the left . ) GENERAL HOETZLER Where 's that blackguard gone with the aperitifs ? ELENA And here 's Gisella . How are you , my darling ? You 're looking so chic , so exactly like yourself . GISELLA They told me you were n't coming . COUNTESS VON STAINZ She wanted to surprise us  --  to make it all the better . KOEPPKE And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mind for no reason except a selfish one . I wanted to see all of you  --  and hear you laugh and joke . ( A veritable orgy of ad-libbing is interrupted when the COUNT appears in the doorway at the left . ) COUNT VON STAINZ ( shouting ) Come in to dinner ! They 're serving champagne ! p. 86 SOPHIA What ? COUNT VON STAINZ Cliquot 1911 ! And caviar ! ( The COUNT 'S announcement is greeted with cheers . POFFY 'S request for lively music has been fulfilled by the orchestra offstage . There is a general movement toward the left . ) GENERAL HOETZLER ( offering ELENA his arm ) With your permission , I think I take the precedence . ( ELENA takes the GENERAL 'S arm and goes out at the left , followed by KOEPPKE and the COUNTESS , POFFY and GISELLA , TALISZ and SOPHIA . Just as ELENA reaches the door , LUCHER enters from the right and rushes across after them shouting : ) FRAU LUCHER Frau Krug ! Frau Krug ! Did you get my message ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , talk and music . ELENA goes out . LUCHER is going after her , but she stops when cries for " Help ! " are heard from the bedroom at the back . The bedroom door flies open and the VALET hurtles out , propelled by RUDOLF , who is now magnificent in his uniform . LUCHER hastily shuts the doors at the left . ) VALET Frau Lucher ! He threatened to strangle me ! p. 87 RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Do you mean to tell me that that stable-boy is dignified with the title of valet ? VALET ( terrified ) I was only trying to brush Your Highness 's hair . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN He scratched my ear . ( RUDOLF slaps the VALET , who rushes out at the right . RUDOLF starts to fasten on his golden sash . ) FRAU LUCHER You 're to stay in that room until I tell you it 's safe to RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Is she here ? ( TORLINI comes in from the upper left . ) FRAU LUCHER ( to RUDOLF ) I told you she would n't come ! TORLINI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the way here . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( turning , to LUCHER ) Ah ! Then she has arrived ? FRAU LUCHER I 've warned you that the police are on the watch RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN She 's here , is n't she ? FRAU LUCHER No ! ( He tweaks her nose . ) Yes ! p. 88 RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Good ! You have acted with unexpected competence . Bring her to me . FRAU LUCHER But they have just sat down to supper . You should join them . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Bring her here ! And champagne with her . I shall not be hungry for another forty-three minutes . ( He crosses to the right to examine himself in the mirror . ) FRAU LUCHER ( to TORLINI ) Request Frau Krug to come here for a moment . ( TORLINI goes out at the left . ) RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Frau Krug ? FRAU LUCHER That is her name ! ( RUDOLF turns again to the mirror , with an expression of disgust . ) You 'd better be careful how you talk to her . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't the same one you used to make free with . Her husband is a very fine man  --  a big man , too , and ( RUDOLF steps up on a chair , the better to see the reflection of his sash in the mirror . ) RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN I shall want some champagne  --  and also more cognac p. 89 FRAU LUCHER I tell you  --  you 'd better not try any of your old tricks on her . She 's different . ( The doors at the left are opened . ELENA appears , looking backward . ) COUNTESS VON STAINZ ( from offstage ) But , my little angel , you 're not going ? ELENA No , no , Tatti , do n't you worry , I 'll be right back . COUNT VON STAINZ Immediately  --  ELENA Yes , immediately . ( She turns and sees RUDOLF on the chair , his back to her . ) RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN And one other thing : the towels in my bath-room are soggy . Have them changed . Get out , Lucher ! ( LUCHER darts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her protuberant stomach , and goes out at the right . ELENA stares at RUDOLF 'S back . He gazes at her image in the mirror . After a few moments , he steps down from the chair , turns and confronts her . The doors at the left have been closed , but the strains of a waltz are faintly audible . RUDOLF starts toward her , pauses , then walks around her . ELENA does not move , but her eyes follow him . He is behind her . He reaches out to touch her , but does n't touch her . He walks around , in front of her , stares at her , then slaps her face . He seizes her in his arms and kisses her , fiercely . A WALTER has come from the right with a bottle of cognac and glasses , followed by a BUS-BOY with an ice bucket containing a bottle of champagne . They deposit these at the right , gaping at RUDOLF and ELENA as they do so. ) p. 90 RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN How long has it been since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ten years ! Think of it ! ( The WAITER makes a slight clatter as he arranges the glasses on the table . RUDOLF , still holding ELENA tightly , motions behind his back to the WAITER to get out . He does so , followed by the BUS-BOY . RUDOLF kisses ELENA more gently . ) Come  --  we 'll have a drink ! ( He steps aside , motions her to the table . She crosses slowly and sits down . He goes behind the table and fills each of the glasses with equal quantities of brandy and champagne . ) ELENA You know  --  I realize now how completely I had forgotten you . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Yes  --  it 's too bad . We 're not equipped with the power to recall sensations . One of our Creator 's more serious mistakes . However  --  to-night we will both refresh our memories . ( He raises his glass , toasting her , then drains it . She raises her glass , slightly , then places it on the table , untouched . ) That 's a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necklace . But  --  good God ! That wedding ring ! ( He laughs boisterously and seizes her hand for closer inspection of the ring. ) p. 91 ELENA That 's nothing to laugh at . ( She is trying to pull her hand away , but he has a tight grip on her wrist . ) RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Of all the bourgeois adornments ! On you , it is a gross anachronism . Like a brassiere on the Venus de Milo . It offends me . We must remove it . ( He snatches the ring from her finger . ) ELENA Give it back to me ! RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN I told you it offends me . ELENA ( struggling ) Are you going to give me back my ring ? RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Yes , my darling  --  I 'll give it back , cheerfully , in the morning . But in the meantime  --  well  --  surely , you can understand my point . That heavy gold band on your finger would strike a discordant note . ELENA I 'm not planning to be in communication with you to-morrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . ) RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( pocketing the ring ) I must ask you to be careful , Elena . Refrain from irritating me . You will recall that the members of my family are subject to epileptic rages  --  sheer exuberance , you know  --  which invariably result in one form or another of physical violence . I should not care to send you back to your husband with your lovely nose broken , and minus one or two conspicuous teeth . p. 92 ELENA ( staring at him ) It ca n't be true ! RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN On the contrary , I can assure you that one more allusion to that detestable ring will prove that it is true . ELENA I was n't thinking about that . I was thinking of what ten years have failed to do to you . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN I chose to remain as I was . ELENA Ten years of exile , and humiliation , and poverty , have n't shaken in you the conviction that Franz Josef is still reigning in Schnbrunn . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN No  --  I admit that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Habsburgs are not what they once were . But when I see you , my eternally beloved , and realize that you have had the pride to preserve your figure against the day of my return  --  then I know that there has been no revolution . ( He has sat down on the table , and is leaning over her , his face increasingly close to hers . ) ELENA Do n't come near me . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN You do n't wish to be kissed ? ELENA I do not ! RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Very well  --  if you feel that you need the inspiration of a little more champagne , you shall have it . ( He goes to pour out another glass for her , but finds that she has had none . He empties her glass into the ice bucket , and refills it . He then hands it to her . She places it on the table . He pours out more for himself. ) p. 93 ELENA ( rising ) We must go in there and join the others . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( pouring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came here to-night to be with them RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Whereas I came here to be with you . Those pitiful relics are of no interest whatever to me . Come now  --  drink ! ELENA I 'm going in there . ( He steps in front of her . ) RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN No , you 're not . ELENA Get out of my way . ( He laughs and gulps some more champagne , but does not budge . She softens her tone to one of persuasion . ) Oh , Rudolf  --  I 'll tell them you 're here . It 's all that 's needed to send the poor things into a complete state of delirium . Think of the excitement when they see you looking as young as ever , and as handsome , in your lovely uniform , with all the medals . Think how pleased he 'd be ( pointing to the portrait ) if he knew that a Habsburg was again holding court in Vienna . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( with a glance at the portrait ) Very well  --  I 'll show myself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightly on the forehead , then crosses to the left and tries the door . It is locked . He turns to ELENA , delighted . ) Lucher 's had us locked in  --  the tactful old bawd . ( He pounds on the door . It is opened . The guests at the banquet offstage are making a great deal of noise , indicative of well-bred hilarity . The voice of STRUP is heard to call out : " His Imperial Highness ! " RUDOLF stands in the doorway . The shouts and murmurs stop as each of the guests sees him . BREDZI 'S little orchestra strikes up the old national anthem . RUDOLF turns and glances at ELENA . She points to the portrait of the late Emperor , and he goes up and takes a position beneath it . POFFY comes in and bows low . The others follow him , the ladies going up to him to kiss his hand . RUDOLF greets each of them by name . He is impassive , regal , mildly disdainful  --  just as they want him to be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is enough  --  enough ! ( He waves them out . ) I may join you later in the evening . ( They all back out . From offstage , the COUNT is heard to shout : " To His Imperial Highness . " ELENA lifts her untouched glass of champagne and sips . There are sounds of shattered glasses from the left . The doors are closed , subduing the uproar of cheers . ) RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Why are they all so old ? ( He gazes toward the left , despondently , then suddenly decides to give this depressing matter not another thought . He turns to ELENA . ) Well ? Have I or have I not done my duty ? ( He comes down to the table . ) Sit down , if you please . ( She sits down at the right of the table . He leans over and kisses her hair . ) Now ! I suggest that we discuss briefly your husband , before we pass on to more mutually agreeable subjects . Do you love him ? ELENA Very much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a doctor , is n't he ? ELENA A psychoanalyst . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Ah ! A practitioner of Vienna 's sole remaining industry . I 've been told he 's quite brilliant . Written a book , has n't he ? p. 95 ELENA Yes  --  eight volumes . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN I must meet him and let him study me . He could derive enough material for eight volumes more . ELENA He knows all about you already . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Ah  --  you 've told him ! ELENA Yes . You 'll find your type analyzed in one of his books under the heading , " Elephantiasis of the Ego . " RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN I doubt that I 'd be interested . ( He sits down at the left of the table . ) Have you any children ? ELENA No . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN I extend my condolences . ( He lifts his glass as in a toast . She bows slightly in acknowledgment . ) These purely intellectual husbands are not very productive , are they ? ELENA It is n't his fault that there are no children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions ? RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Let me see No  --  I think there are n't . We can dismiss the dreary topic of your domestic life  --  and press on to consideration of my own . But I suppose you know all about it . p. 96 ELENA No , Rudolf . I have not followed your later career very closely . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN No ? ELENA No . How have you supported yourself ? RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN In various ways . Now and then a good run at baccarat . One or two engagements in the cinema studios  --  did you see me in " The Shattered Idol " ? ELENA No , I missed that , deliberately . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN You did well . As it turned out , I was virtually invisible . Then I conceived a great scheme for mulcting American tourists , but the authorities got wind of it , and took over the idea themselves . There have been other occupations . ELENA Some one told me you 've been running a taxi . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Merely an amusing whim . I 've only driven people I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you start the drive , you do before it 's finished . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( laughing ) You 've evidently been listening to gossip . ELENA Yes . I 've heard how charming you are to your fares . You must have collected many delightful friends that way . p. 97 RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( wistfully ) Friends ? You can hardly call them that . ELENA No  --  I suppose not . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN As a matter of fact , Elena , Nice is a bore . I have been very lonely . ELENA I 've been waiting for you to say that . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN You have no sympathy for me ? ELENA No . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Your heart was n't always cold . ELENA You have never been lonely  --  never deserved one atom of sympathy , from any one . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN You do n't understand me . No one has ever understood me . It 's because I 'm inscrutable . ELENA Perhaps . But I remain unimpressed by your appeal for pity . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Pity ! Have you the effrontery to suggest that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAXIMILLIAN I see . Then I shall abandon that tack . ( He laughs . ) Elena  --  it has always seemed miraculous to me that any one could be as intelligent as you are and still alluring . And you are alluring ! p. 98 ELENA ( bowing ) You 're overwhelmingly kind . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Oh  --  that was n't intended as a tribute to you . It 's a tribute to my own flawless taste . ELENA Ah ! I see . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN I 'm proud to think that it was I who first realized you , for the sight of you now assures me that , by God , I was right . You 're so beautiful , Elena . You delight me ! You refresh me  --  and I am speaking nothing less than the truth when I tell you that refreshment is what I most urgently need . ELENA What tack are you off on now ? RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN None . I am driving straight to the point . My room is in there . ELENA How convenient ! RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Yes . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose we 've occupied all of them . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN We have , indeed , my darling . We have made history in this hotel . Come  --  let us make some more . ELENA ( pause ) Rudolf RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Yes ? p. 99 ELENA I think it 's time for me to announce that I 'm not going to bed with you . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( after a while ) Very well . ( He stands up , as though accepting her rejection , and walks away . Drink in hand , he turns and looks at her . ) I can wait ( he sips the drink ) a few minutes . ( He looks toward the left . ) Who 's playing in there ? ELENA Bredzi . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( pleased ) Bredzi ! ( He goes to the left and calls " Bredzi ! Bredzi ! " The doors are opened and BREDZI comes in , with his violin . He is in a fever of excitement , and knows precisely what is expected of him . Following him is JANSEI , an accordion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waltz ! ( With appropriate flourishes , they start to play " Viennese Beauties " RUDOLF turns and crosses to the table where ELENA is sitting . The musicians follow him , playing as they go . RUDOLF bows before ELENA . Laughing , she rises and curtseys , and then they start to waltz around the room . The tempo is sprightly , exuberant . RUDOLF manages to manuvre ELENA to the bedroom door . He kicks it open and they waltz into the room and disappear . The musicians whisper to each other happily  --  for this is just as it should be . However , after a moment , ELENA comes out alone , laughing . RUDOLF follows . She sits on the couch . ) You know  --  I 'm being admirably patient with you . p. 100 ELENA ( still laughing ) Yes , Rudolf  --  I know . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Because I understand you , too well . I can read your thoughts . ELENA No ! RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN I can see that as a result of your purely spiritual marriage you have developed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Very well ! I accept the challenge confidently ! ( He has a drink of champagne , then turns to BREDZI . ) Play something more  --  more . ( BREDZI understands , and obliges with a palpitantly passionate selection . For a moment , RUDOLF stands , silently regarding ELENA . ) Does that remind you of anything ? ELENA Yes . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN What ? ELENA Ischl ! ( RUDOLF crosses to the couch and lies down beside her . Knowing all the moves in this game , BREDZI goes close to ELENA and plays softly , persuasively . ) RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Ischl ! Do you remember one night when it was too warm to stay indoors ? ELENA Yes , we went out into the forest , and you took along an entire symphony orchestra to accompany us. p. 101 RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN I always adored music . ELENA And you had all the musicians blindfolded . The poor things . They could n't play in harmony because they could n't see . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN It was dreadful ! ELENA And you cursed the leader horribly  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you tried to stop me , I knocked you down . ELENA Then you dismissed the orchestra  --  and we went on with our romance . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Oh God , what beautiful times ! ( ELENA is now lying back on the couch , languorously . RUDOLF kisses the hollow of her throat . Then it occurs to him to kiss her ankle . BREDZI feels that it is time to shift the tune . Raising up on his elbow , RUDOLF suddenly signals the musicians to be quiet . ) Do you imagine that I need any artificial stimulation from you . Get out ! ( They hurry out at the left , closing the door after them . RUDOLF stands up . ) It 's no use bantering this way and that about it , Elena . I know now if I did n't know before that I have never loved any woman as I love you . When I see you I know that I 've never loved any one else at all . You were , you are and ever will be the one passion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 102 ELENA I am glowing . What other women have you known since then ? RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Plenty . All kinds . ELENA All colors ? RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN All shades . There have been French women , English women , Americans . I 've had a few tempting offers of marriage , but Then there have been Russians , Moroccans , Siamese ELENA Twins ? RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN No , unfortunately . But I can swear to you , Elena , that all of them were no more than incidents . Whatever enjoyment I 've had from them  --  and I 'll be generous and admit that there has been some enjoyment  --  has been vicarious . Every quivering one of them has been no more than a proxy for you . Ah , Elena  --  if you could know how I 've clung to you , how I 've cherished you . Memory has been kind to me , my darling . It has kept you with me , through all the nights and days . ( He is again on the couch , at her side . She jumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nervous irritability in her voice . ) ELENA It has been otherwise with me ! RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN What do you mean ? ELENA Memory has been kinder to me . It has discreetly withdrawn p. 103 RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Behind the curtains of your imagination  --  but it is still there , alive and warm , aching to emerge . ELENA No , it is dead ! RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN I refuse to accept that , sight unseen . ELENA I have looked behind the curtains and seen it . It is decayed and loathsome . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN You 're talking nonsense from your husband 's books . ELENA I 'm talking truth  --  bitter truth , for you , perhaps . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN I do n't believe it . ELENA Because you will not face the one important fact . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Which is what ? ELENA I am happy with my husband . ( He laughs . ) I love him ! RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN You will notice that I am laughing . ELENA And you may notice that I am not going to bed with you . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Elena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been enduring the physical intimacies of this great thinker , never once have you shut your eyes and assured yourself , " It 's Rudolf Maximillian. " p. 104 ELENA Not in years have I thought of that . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN But there were times at first , were n't there ? Many times ? ELENA There may have been . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN I thought so  --  and they became less frequent as the years went by  --  not because you were learning to be happy with him , but because you were learning to be resigned . You see  --  I know something about your psychology , too . Now , come  --  we 've had enough of debate . It 's time for a little emotion . We 'll see if we 've forgotten what life tastes like . ELENA ( indicating the door at the left ) I 'm going back in there . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN You are not ! ( He seizes her wrist and pulls her against him , then holds her tightly in his arms . ) You are now expected to shriek . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had forgotten that you are not the shrieking kind . That was always one of your most engaging qualities , Elena . You invariably knew when you were beaten . ( He kisses her several times , on her eyes , ears , nose and throat . She offers no apparent resistance and no response . ) Ah , Elena , my only darling  --  it is n't easy for you to yield , is it ? You keep on thinking of that wedding ring in my pocket . You 're loyal to him , because you have the courage to be decent . You were always loyal , always brave . But with me , it is n't as it would be with any one else . Ca n't you see that ? I loved you first . And you loved me . You were n't lying when you said you loved me . You never knew how to lie . And I 'm only asking you to love me again , for a little while , reminiscently , not as a rival of your husband , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were innocent and impressionable and young . You ca n't tell me that those things have changed . I can see that they have n't . You have not grown old . The warmth is still in you . You can still make me adore you , and I can still make you love me ! ( He sits down on the couch , still holding her tightly as she stands before him . ) Why not admit it , Elena ? Why maintain that formidable rigidity , as though you were a pure-minded school girl in the clutches of an avid gorilla ? Relax , my darling . Let yourself go . ( She has begun to laugh . ) Have I happened to say something witty ? ( ELENA continues to laugh . ) There is something in the quality of that laughter which suggests that I 'm wasting my time wooing you . p. 105 ELENA You told me to let myself go ! RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN I did , but it was not intended as a pleasantry . ( He is seated on the couch . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face and kisses him as ferociously as he had kissed her . ) Great God , Elena , I did n't expect ELENA ( passionately ) No , you did n't expect me to take your advice so quickly . ( She slaps his face . ) Did you ? You thought I 'd keep up the pretense of frigidity forever , did n't you ? ( She kisses him again . As she does so , he pulls her down on to the couch . She rolls over him . ) Am I frozen now ? RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN No , there 's been an unaccountable thaw . ( She kisses him again . ) ELENA Am I restraining myself now ? Am I being subdued , repressed , coldly unresponsive ? Am I ? ( She slaps him again . ) RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN No ! But for God 's sake , Elena  --  there is such a thing as going too far . ELENA No , there is n't . Let 's open the doors . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN No. p. 106 ELENA Yes ! I want them to see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can never change . ( She goes to the doors , flings them open , and shouts " Come on  --  come on ! " POFFY , GISELLA and the rest come in , laughing , shouting . BREDZI and JANSEI are with them , playing " The Merry Widow " waltz . ) RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( through the happy din ) Look at her ! Look at her ! She has been hitting me  --  hitting me with all the old strength ! Show them how you did it , my darling ! ( She slaps him again . He kisses her gratefully . Then he picks her up in his arms and waltzes her into the bedroom . KOEPPKE rushes after them and smirkingly closes the door . The others cheer lustily and wave their champagne glasses . ) TALISZ I give them both happiness ! SOPHIA Happiness  --  and love ! POFFY May the night last forever ! ( He is standing on the sofa , singing , while BREDZI plays softly . The COUNTESS crosses to the COUNT , who kisses her . ) COUNTESS VON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( HOETZLER bows to GISELLA , who curtsies , and they begin to waltz . SOPHIA goes to the couch. ) p. 107 SOPHIA ( transported ) It is the same Vienna  --  the same exquisite Vienna . COUNT VON STAINZ Just as it always was ! Nothing has changed . COUNTESS VON STAINZ I do n't care if I die to-morrow . I really do n't care at all . ( LUCHER bustles in , terribly perturbed . ) FRAU LUCHER ( to HOETZLER ) Hush ! Where has he gone ? ( Waltzing with GISELLA , the GENERAL ignores LUCHER , who dashes to the left and shouts at KOEPPKE . ) Where is he ? KOEPPKE We do n't wish to be disturbed now . TALISZ What is she saying ? FRAU LUCHER ( thundering ) Bredzi ! Stop ! ( The music stops . POFFY , still standing on the couch and singing , turns to LUCHER . ) POFFY ( sublimely unworried ) Is there anything the matter ? FRAU LUCHER Herr Povoromo ! Get down off that brocade ! ( POFFY descends . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've heard this racket and one of the bottles you threw hit somebody in the street . ( Gleeful cheers hail this gratifying news. ) p. 108 KOEPPKE ( archly ) They 'll hear no uproar from the arch-ducal chamber . FRAU LUCHER Where has he gone ? And Frau Krug ? What 's he done with her ? SOPHIA We have n't the faintest idea . ( They all laugh . ) COUNT VON STAINZ Resume the music , Bredzi . ( The general , mildly intoxicated laughter is interrupted by the sound of sharp knocking from within the bedroom . ) GENERAL HOETZLER What is that ? RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( offstage ) Elena ! Elena ! ( More pounding is heard . LUCHER starts up to the door . HOETZLER , SOPHIA , KOEPPKE and GISELLA stop her . ) FRAU LUCHER Have you all gone crazy ? The police will get him ! SOPHIA Ssh ! ( RUDOLF bursts out of the room , rushes to the right . Through the opened door , on the bed , is ELENA 'S white dress . ) RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Elena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then returns . ) Where is she ? Why do you all stand there , frozen ? Go after her . Find her . ( HOETZLER , SOPHIA , the COUNT , TALISZ and KOEPPKE go off babbling " We 'll find her . We 'll bring her back , " etc . ) I never should have trusted her to go into that bathroom alone . p. 109 COUNTESS VON STAINZ ( frightened ) How did she get out ? Did she jump out of the window ? RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN No . She went through another door . I would n't have trusted her if it had n't been for the affectionate way she hit me . Elena ! ( He is still pacing about frantically , from door to door . SOPHIA comes in again . ) SOPHIA She 's left the hotel ! COUNTESS VON STAINZ She ought to be ashamed of herself . FRAU LUCHER She 's gone home ! RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Home ? And where is that ? Where does she live ? FRAU LUCHER You 've got to stay here . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hotel now . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Get my cap . FRAU LUCHER I tell you she 's gone back to her husband . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN That psychoanalyst ? So much the better . Get my cap ! ( He propels LUCHER toward the bedroom . ) Now which one of you verminous objects is going to tell me where she lives ? p. 110 GISELLA I do n't know where she lives . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( to the COUNTESS ) Do you know ? COUNTESS VON STAINZ ( timorously ) Poffy can tell you . Poffy knows . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( to POFFY ) You will escort me there . POFFY If you set foot out of this hotel you 're insane . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN You 're still threatening me with the police ? POFFY They 'll recognize you , Your Highness . SOPHIA Oh , we beg of Your Highness RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Any member of the Vienna police force who lays a hand on me will find himself at the bottom of the canal . ( LUCHER has returned with the Tyrolean hat . ) FRAU LUCHER Here ! RUDOLF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform is no longer worn in Vienna . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN I do n't give ten thousand damns what 's worn p. 111 FRAU LUCHER ( screaming at him ) They 'll shoot you . They 'll jump at the chance to finish you . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( calmly ) Very well . Very well . ( He has put on the hat , and a cape which POFFY has brought for him . ) FRAU LUCHER She does n't want you any more . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Oh , yes , she does . She 's leading me on . She wants the thrill of the chase . Well  --  she shall have it ! ( He crosses to the right and picks up the brandy bottle from the table . ) And if the accommodations at her house are inadequate I 'll bring her back here . So see to it that this party is still going on when I return , whether it 's tomorrow  --  or the next day  --  or whenever . Come on , Poffy . ( He has gone out , followed by POFFY . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He 'll do it ! GISELLA Nothing will stop him ! SOPHIA He 'll bring her back , and the party will go on forever ! FRAU LUCHER You fools ! You fools ! Do n't you see what will happen ? They 'll catch him . They 'll kill him . To-morrow there 'll be another Habsburg burning in hell . ( POFFY comes in quickly. ) p. 112 POFFY Frau Lucher ! FRAU LUCHER ( gasping ) Have they got him ? POFFY No . His Imperial Highness presents his compliments and wishes you to advance him a few schillings for his taxi-fare . ( LUCHER is muttering a series of unprintable imprecations as she digs into her capacious hand-bag. ) @x Again the living room in the KRUG home . The time is directly after the end of Act II . There are spots of light about the room , but the surrounding shadows are deep . In one of the areas of shadow ANTON is seated , listening to the radio , though not relaxed . He continually looks toward the window  --  toward the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window , parts the curtains , and peers out . ELENA comes in , breathless and agitated . RUDOLF 'S cape is about her , clutched tightly , masking the absence of her white dress . She hurries past ANTON and turns off the radio . DR . ANTON KRUG ( turning from the window ) Well , how was it ? ELENA Just about as I expected . DR . ANTON KRUG Amusing ? ELENA No . DR . ANTON KRUG No excitement ? ELENA None . DR . ANTON KRUG You did n't stay there very long . ELENA Did n't I ? ( She is going toward her room . ) DR . ANTON KRUG ( gently ) It was evidently a bit upsetting . p. 114 ELENA It was nothing of the kind . DR . ANTON KRUG I do n't like to question you , Elena , but I 'm rather afraid that ELENA ( with uncharacteristic petulance ) You like nothing better than to question me . ( She is at the back . He is still by the window at the right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . ELENA Oh  --  not usually . But to-night why did you ask me to go ? Why ? DR . ANTON KRUG I thought you might have a good time . ELENA You were wrong . You know , Anton , your prescriptions are not infallible . But  --  let 's not talk about it now . I 'm tired . ( Old KRUG has come in from the upper left . He is in his bath-robe , night-shirt and slippers . ) OLD KRUG Ah ! So you 're back . I thought I heard you come in . Well , how was the party ? Did anything interesting happen ? Tell us all about it . DR . ANTON KRUG She 's going to bed . OLD KRUG Who all was there ? Any famous people ? ( ELENA has gone up to the door of her room . ) And what  --  where 's your dress ? p. 115 ELENA Good night , father . Good night , Anton . ( She goes into her room . ) OLD KRUG Hmm ! Well , what do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , lights a cigarette , nervously . KRUG comes down slowly . ) Did n't you notice anything about the way she said good night ? No kisses , nor sweet dreams , nor any affection . And that costume ! She was wearing a dress when she left here , was n't she ? There 's something the matter . Did n't you notice it ? DR . ANTON KRUG ( sharply ) No ! OLD KRUG Well , if you did n't I did ! And I do n't set myself up as a great mind-reader , like you . I could see that something happened there at Lucher 's DR . ANTON KRUG She 's tired , that 's all . OLD KRUG Yes  --  but why is she tired ? That 's what we ought to know . And what happened to her dress ? That 's what we ought to find out . You ought to ask a few questions about this ( The insistent ringing of the night bell is heard . ) DR . ANTON KRUG There 's nothing to find out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DR . ANTON KRUG I can hear it . OLD KRUG What do you suppose it is ? DR . ANTON KRUG I have n't the faintest idea . ( From the right can be heard peremptory pounding on the front door and loud shouts . ANTON crosses to the right and goes out . ) OLD KRUG But listen . That sounds like trouble RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( offstage ) You need n't announce me KATHIE ( shrieking , offstage ) Oh ! Herr Professor ! It 's a madman . OLD KRUG ( excited ) You 'd better get out your pistol , Anton . It 's another one of your patients gone insane . KATHIE ( offstage ) A maniac ! His keeper is with him but he wo n't listen . He forced his way in . I could n't stop him . POFFY ( offstage ) I 'm sorry , Herr Professor . If there had been any conceivable way of avoiding this RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN A thousand pardons for the disturbance , but this dutiful handmaiden seemed to feel that I should be denied admittance . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ANTON and KATHIE . RUDOLF is still carrying the bottle of brandy , as a weapon . He addresses KRUG . ) Are you the doctor ? p. 117 OLD KRUG Yes ! No ! RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN No ? OLD KRUG No ! He is . ( He points to ANTON . RUDOLF turns and confronts the husband of ELENA . ) And I am his father RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Ah ! So you are the Herr Professor Doctor ! I am frankly surprised . My imagination had adorned you with a gray beard , a long one . ( He bows . ) How do you do ? DR . ANTON KRUG Who are you ? RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Eh ? You are asking me who ? OLD KRUG I can tell you who he is RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN He does n't know who I am , Poffy . Come  --  step up ! Present me . POFFY Professor Krug  --  this is the former Archduke Rudolf Maximillian . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN The former ! One would think I had already joined my ancestors in their eternal empire . OLD KRUG Oh ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will readily observe that such is not the case . I am here , in your charming home , and I wish to see your wife . p. 118 DR . ANTON KRUG My wife has gone to bed . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN She will wish to be aroused . ( ANTON regards RUDOLF for a moment , then crosses in front of him and addresses KRUG . ) DR . ANTON KRUG Go to bed , father . OLD KRUG Me ? DR . ANTON KRUG ( motioning him off ) Yes ! Do as you 're told . ( In a state of extreme disgruntlement , old KRUG turns and ambles slowly up toward the steps . RUDOLF removes his hat . ) RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( to POFFY ) And you 're no longer needed , Poffy . Go back to Lucher 's and see that they carry on . POFFY You had better come with me . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN I may be detained a little longer than I had expected . POFFY I 'll be at the hotel on call . ( POFFY goes out at the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . ) OLD KRUG ( calling through the door ) Elena , the Archduke Rudolf Maximillian von Habsburg is calling on us and they 're sending me to bed . ( KRUG goes on out at the upper left . ANTON confronts RUDOLF , who holds the brandy bottle at the alert . After a moment , ANTON smiles and advances toward RUDOLF. ) p. 119 DR . ANTON KRUG I  --  I wish I could tell you how glad I am to see you . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( startled ) You 're glad  --  to see me ? DR . ANTON KRUG I should think you could imagine why . You 've been something of a presence in my home , for a long time , ever since Elena and I were married . Not an entirely agreeable presence , I might add . ( He laughs . ) But one that we could never quite get rid of . At times , you 've stalked about this house as if you owned it . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( pleased ) I have ? DR . ANTON KRUG I naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the chance to see you , and talk to you , I can feel much more friendly toward that presence . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( bewildered ) Well ! I 've known husbands in my time  --  but you 're the first one who ever granted me a kind word . ( He steps forward . They bow and shake hands . ) I 'm glad to see you , too , Herr Professor . Your vast reputation has not done you justice . DR . ANTON KRUG A remarkably graceful compliment ! p. 120 RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Of course , I 've known you through your books . Oh , yes ! I 've studied them , carefully . DR . ANTON KRUG All eight volumes ? RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN You do n't believe me , do you ? Very well  --  cross-examine me ! DR . ANTON KRUG No , no . I do n't like cross-examinations . I 'm only too eager to take your word for it . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN It 's very fortunate that you are . Otherwise I should have been proved a liar . ( He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both laugh . ELENA comes in , now wearing a negligee . ) But I 'm going to read them . I know now that they 're good . ( He sees ELENA . ) Elena , we 're friends ! ( ELENA , on the landing , looks from RUDOLF to ANTON . ) ELENA Are you ? DR . ANTON KRUG Of course we are . We see eye to eye on the most important subject . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN As a matter of fact , we 're an incredibly happy combination . Your husband represents the sublimity of the intellectual , and I the quintessence of the emotional . You know  --  between us , just about there  --  ( he points to a spot on the carpet )  --  there ought to be found the perfect man ! ( ANTON laughs . ELENA comes down , goes over to the left , beside ANTON. ) p. 121 DR . ANTON KRUG Please go on talking . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Gladly ! I have a great deal of interest to say . ( He sits down in a chair in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it short , Rudolf . Not that I 'm unmindful of the great distinction conferred on our house by your presence here  --  but I 'm sleepy . We 're sleepy . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN I am still confident of my ability to keep you awake . But my words are not for you , my darling . They are for our mutual friend , your husband . DR . ANTON KRUG I am anxious to hear them . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN I 'm sure you are . And I 'm equally sure that you 'll be sympathetic . You 're a brilliant psychologist  --  but more than that , you 're a Viennese . You will know what I mean . ( ANTON bows . ) But here  --  I seem to be the only one who 's seated . Wo n't you please sit down ? DR . ANTON KRUG No  --  if you do n't mind ( ELENA sits down on the edge of the couch . ) RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( settling back in the chair ) No , I do n't mind . Well  --  to begin at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I have been making advances to your wife . I am here now to continue them until the desired objective has been reached . Am I making myself clear ? p. 122 DR . ANTON KRUG Perfectly clear . ELENA So far . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Good ! You are obviously a man of superior perception . You will not fail to see the validity of my claim . Fifteen years ago I became intimate with Elena . And when I say that I became intimate with her , I hope you will understand that I DR . ANTON KRUG I am familiar with the preface . You may skip it . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN No , no . I decline to do so . Indeed , I wish to dwell on it . She was then a maiden , exquisitely frail , standing hesitantly upon the threshold of infinite potentiality , if you will forgive my eloquence . Ah  --  she was lovely , Herr Professor . You would have adored her . DR . ANTON KRUG I 'm sure of it . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN As for myself , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I first looked upon her , and felt the touch of her hand and saw the virginal invitation that was in her eyes , I vowed to myself , " This is the ultimate ! " So I made her my mistress . For four beautiful years , I was devotedly ELENA It was hardly more than two . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Do n't interrupt ! p. 123 ELENA Do n't exaggerate ! RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( rising , enraged ) If I 'm to be interrupted ! ELENA Do n't exaggerate ! RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN I do so only because of a desire to flatter you . ( He turns apologetically to ANTON . ) Permit me to continue : our idyllic romance was terminated by the revolution . Austria was compelled to give up most of her treasured provinces and possessions , including my family . ( He sits down again . ) We were at Lucher 's together when the summons came . I promised her I 'd return immediately  --  but I did n't return . I never even had a chance to say good-bye to her . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now to ANTON . ) We were denied the privilege of parting as most lovers do , with the customary romantic heroism  --  hypocritical selfsacrifice . We were wrenched apart . ( He indicates the arbitrary separation with a gesture of his clenched fists . ) Surely , Herr Doctor , you can see the significance of that wrench . DR . ANTON KRUG I 've seen a great deal of it . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( resuming ) The pretense of adjustment had to be made . In my exile I concluded that I should never see my darling again and I made every effort to reconcile myself to that dismal realization . The effort was not completely successful . For ten years I have felt the lack of her . So I decided to return to Vienna , and have one more look at her , and let my youthful illusions be shattered once and for all . p. 124 DR . ANTON KRUG That was a highly intelligent decision  --  was n't it , Elena ? ELENA I 'm not quite certain . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Oh , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have become a commonplace , obese , bourgeois housewife . DR . ANTON KRUG She has resisted the influences surrounding her . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN She has , indeed , and I 've been grievously disappointed . I find that my acute want of her was no illusion . It remains a fact . ( He rises . ) A fact ! ( He crosses and stands behind the couch . ) Which we all must face . ELENA Yes , Anton . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Perhaps you do n't believe that it is a fact . Elena did n't at first . I told her something this evening  --  something that I 'd have confessed to no other woman . I told her that all the enjoyment I 've had has been vicarious . I , too , have been conscious of a presence . Elena has been in attendance at all the sordid little romances I have ever known . ( Turning to ELENA . ) Oh , my dear , you 'd be horrified if you knew how many fantastic shapes you have assumed . ( To ANTON . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 125 DR . ANTON KRUG Nothing is disgusting that is said with such artless sincerity . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( to ELENA ) He 's charming  --  charming ! ( To ANTON . ) I knew you were qualified to deal with this situation , Herr Doctor . You see , Elena told me : you 've written a whole book about me . DR . ANTON KRUG What ? ELENA I told him nothing of the kind . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN You did . You distinctly said he 'd analyzed me ELENA ( cutting in ) I did not . I said he 'd written about that much , explaining your type . ( She indicates about two inches between her thumb and forefinger . ) RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( to ANTON ) Evidently you can say volumes in a few words . Ah , Herr Doctor  --  it 's enlightening to confront any one like you , who can view things impersonally , and with none of the usual moralistic indignation . You 're a scientist  --  thank God  --  and I beg of you to consider me as your patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know I need . DR . ANTON KRUG I 'm afraid that 's impossible , my friend . p. 126 ELENA ( to RUDOLF ) That 's absurd . It takes a long time to complete a treatment . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN So much the better . I do n't mind remaining in Vienna indefinitely . But now is the time to begin , Herr Doctor . I want some professional advice . DR . ANTON KRUG I ca n't give it . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN But I insist that you can . ELENA It 's not his custom to give advice . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Nonsense  --  he 's a doctor  --  a distinguished one . ELENA By a process of suggestion , he compels the patient to advise himself . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( to ANTON ) Very well , then  --  suggest something . DR . ANTON KRUG No . You have ideas of your own . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN A bewilderingly wide variety . DR . ANTON KRUG I do n't doubt it . But it is useless for me to try to consider this in the light of my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just this way before . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Why , with Elena for a wife I should think that this sort of thing would be coming up all the time . p. 127 DR . ANTON KRUG I agree one would naturally think so . ( ANTON is beginning to betray evidences of impatience which might easily develop into violent wrath . ) ELENA But one would be wrong . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Well , I 'm glad . DR . ANTON KRUG I 'm only a psychiatrist . Your case requires the specialized services of a neuro-pathologist . There is a very good one in Munich . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Munich ? But that 's a long way off  --  and the night is slipping through our fingers . DR . ANTON KRUG That 's the only advice I can give you , Herr von Habsburg . There 's nothing I can do to help you . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( appalled ) Herr von Habsburg ! So that 's my name ? Herr von Habsburg ! Oh  --  I 'm not protesting . It is my name ! It would have been patronizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( During the foregoing speech he has crossed to the left , close to ANTON , as though , for a moment , he had considered a demonstration of his resentment of the humiliating " Herr . " He now sits down , slumping , on a chair that is between ANTON , who is standing before the fireplace , and ELENA , on the couch . It should be noted that through this dialogue ELENA is watching both of them with enthralled interest , alarmed expectancy and mounting excitement . With apparent weariness , RUDOLF continues : ) You were saying something about a doctor in Munich . p. 128 DR . ANTON KRUG Yes . I 'll give you a letter to him , and I urge that you go and consult him at once . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( with a flash of anger ) But I do n't want to go to Munich ! I want this problem to be settled now ! DR . ANTON KRUG I 'm not a witch doctor . I ca n't straighten out a mass of glandular complications with a wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Oh , but I 'm not complicated  --  even though I do like to represent myself as an enigma . ( To ELENA . ) You do n't mind my talking about myself ? ELENA Not at all . We 're used to it . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN It 's a fascinating subject . You must realize , Herr Doctor , that for all my talk , I 'm simply a man who lives on sensations . They 're meat and drink and breath of life to me . At the moment , I 'm desperately in need of nourishment  --  nourishment for my self-esteem . My ego is like the belly of a starving man  --  it 's bloated but empty . DR . ANTON KRUG And you imagine that I can furnish the necessary nourishment ? RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN If you ca n't  --  no one else can . p. 129 DR . ANTON KRUG If this could be dealt with in a rational manner , it would be simple . I 'd tell you to look at her to your heart 's content  --  fill your imagination with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so while ANTON snaps out the following : ) And then see for yourself that for you she has no substance ; she 's a dream that you 've explained , and disposed of , and that you can never recapture . But it is n't so simple as all that . ( Slowly RUDOLF turns away from ELENA , rises , confronts ANTON . ) RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN You 're right , my friend . It is n't so simple . I must do more than just look . ( ANTON walks away , toward the right . ) ELENA Well , Anton  --  what have you to say to that ? DR . ANTON KRUG ( irritably ) There 's nothing for me to say . I do n't want to have anything to say . ( There is a pregnant pause . ) RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN I know  --  it 's a damned awkward situation . And it would n't have arisen if it had n't been for your decency . When I came in here I was ready to fight , and either be dragged out myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so kind . You were so friendly . You showed me that this dispute should be settled by reason as opposed to force . p. 130 DR . ANTON KRUG I find that this dispute has become essentially unreasonable . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN It has not ! My impulses are entirely natural . DR . ANTON KRUG And so are my objections to your impulses . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Oh ! So you do object ? DR . ANTON KRUG Yes ! I do ! ( His attitude is now one of undisguised belligerence . ) RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN You 're not friendly with me any more . Why ? Do you imagine that I want to take her away from you for good and all ? I can reassure you on that point . I want her for one night only . That will give me enough to live on for another ten years  --  by which time I 'll hardly be a serious menace to you or to any one . Now  --  surely  --  you can have no objection to that ? DR . ANTON KRUG You 're forcing me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN If you will permit me to say so , you assumed that position voluntarily when you married her . DR . ANTON KRUG Yes , yes ! I know that ! RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN You admitted the presence that is in your house , and now that the presence has materialized , are you afraid to face it ? p. 131 ELENA No ! Anton ! You wo n't let him say that . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN No ! No ! I do n't believe it ! You 're a man of exalted intellect . You know that jealousy is merely a manifestation of fear , and you have banished fear as completely as you have banished the odious Habsburgs . Is n't that so ? DR . ANTON KRUG We 've expelled the Habsburgs from Austria , but not all of us have expelled the Habsburgs from ourselves . Now , I want you to leave . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN What ? DR . ANTON KRUG I 'm asking you to go . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Taking Elena with me ? DR . ANTON KRUG No . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Even though she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you bothered to consult her as to that ? ( ELENA rises and crosses to the fire-place . ) ELENA Oh , leave me out of this . I 'm only the guerdon in this conflict . You will have to dispose of me between yourselves . DR . ANTON KRUG Get out ! RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Oh  --  I 'm disappointed in you , Herr Doctor . I thought you were one who had conquered all the baser emotions . But now I see that you are just a husband  --  no better than the rest of them . p. 132 DR . ANTON KRUG Unless you go of your own accord , I shall attempt to put you out  --  and I believe I shall succeed . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN I 'm sure you can . But not without making a ridiculous spectacle of yourself . DR . ANTON KRUG ( taking off his glasses ) Then I shall not delay the process . ( He now starts to take off his coat . Observing this , RUDOLF starts to take off his coat , turning to ELENA , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have exposed him before your eyes . This colossus of the intellect , this triumph of civilization , is behaving like a vindictive ape . DR . ANTON KRUG Get out ! RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( going up and putting his coat on the balcony rail ) I have to warn you that I 'm not going to fight fair . DR . ANTON KRUG You 'd better not watch this , Elena . ELENA Nothing could induce me to leave now ! ( She sits down on the bench before the fire-place . ) I 've just realized that I 've been waiting for this moment for years . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN That 's right . Stay where you are . When I 've had enough I 'll call to you and you can drag him off me . ( He picks up a small , modernistic metal statue from the bookcase and brandishes it . ) Come on , Herr Professor . It 's for you to begin the brawl. p. 133 ELENA Put that down ! ( RUDOLF examines the statue . ) RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Do you like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obeys . ) RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( to ANTON ) I 'm now unarmed . I 'm a competent swordsman but I 'm hopelessly inept with my fists . I 'm forced to the indignity of treating with you . I 'll make you an offer . DR . ANTON KRUG Make it quickly . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN A very handsome one DR . ANTON KRUG Make it quickly ! RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( with convincing fervor ) Give her to me for this one night , and I shall give to you in return my one possession  --  namely , this carcass that I wear about my immortal soul , these priceless pounds of flesh . To-morrow I shall go forth upon the Ringstrasse . I shall kick and insult policemen . My identity will become known . I shall be beaten to earth and shot , and I shall die gloriously in the gutter , my head pillowed on a pile of excrement . But before I take this suicidal action , I shall sign documents bequeathing my remains , unconditionally , to the eminent Professor Doctor what 's the name ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is left of me will be yours . You will appreciate my value to science . You may lay me out on your operating table , you may probe , dissect me , discover just what it is about me that has made me what I am , the quality that dominated most of Europe for six hundred years . You will be able to say to your students : " Here , gentlemen  --  this revolting object that I hold before you is the heart of a Habsburg ! " ( There is a prolonged pause . ) No ? You reject my offer ? You insist on being primitive ? Very well , then ! Come on , Herr Doctor  --  ( He steps back and achieves a pose . ) I 'm waiting for that bull-like rush . DR . ANTON KRUG You are succeeding in your object . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN I  --  succeeding ? DR . ANTON KRUG You are making a fool of me . I should have heeded your warning that you would n't fight fair . There are a thousand excellent reasons why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But confronting you this way , in the presence of my wife , whom I wish above all others to impress , I ca n't do it . I could finish the fight , but I ca n't start it . ELENA No , Anton , you 're wrong . You could n't finish it . I am the only one who could do that . I should have known it there at Lucher 's . ( The night bell rings . ) I should n't have tried to escape . That 's the mistake I 've always ( The bell rings again . ) Who is that ? p. 135 RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Do n't tell me that the doctor is being summoned to a patient ! ( The bell rings again . ) ELENA Shall I go ? ( She crosses to the right . ) DR . ANTON KRUG No  --  Kathie is awake . ( Old KRUG comes in . ) OLD KRUG I heard the bell ! I thought it might be something important . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Let us hope it is not a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . ) KATHIE Herr Professor Doctor ! ( POFFY rushes in . ) POFFY Herr Professor Doctor , my deepest apologies for bursting in in this manner but DR . ANTON KRUG What is it ? POFFY It 's the police . OLD KRUG The police ! DR . ANTON KRUG What do they want ? POFFY His Imperial Highness was seen tearing down the Kartnerstrasse in a taxi ( Old KRUG whistles. ) p. 136 ELENA They want him ! They 've found out about him ! RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN By all means let them have me . It 's an easy disposition of your problem , Herr Professor . ELENA No . You will have to hide . Go in there . DR . ANTON KRUG What good will that do ? The police will keep on till they find him . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN I shall not hide ! I prefer to stand and face them . ELENA No , you wo n't . Go in there . Kathie  --  tell the police that Dr. Krug will see them in a moment . KATHIE Yes , ma'am . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must hide ! The whole force is out searching for you . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( going up ) This is the very depth of ignominy . OLD KRUG In here , Your Imperial Highness . ELENA Here ! ( She hands him his Tyrolean hat . ) RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN I will not be arrested in this God-damned hat ! ( He goes into the room at the back. ) p. 137 ELENA Shut the door , father . ( KRUG does so  --  ELENA motions him to his bedroom . He pouts but goes out , upper left . ) DR . ANTON KRUG We 'll have to see them . POFFY I beg of you , Herr Professor , go down and send them away . DR . ANTON KRUG Do you think that will stop them from going on with their search ? POFFY But , surely , they will listen to you . Your position DR . ANTON KRUG They know perfectly well that there was every likelihood of his coming here . I might get them out of this house , but I ca n't prevent them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have the greatest influence with the authorities . You can speak to them , persuade them DR . ANTON KRUG To do what ? To allow him to remain here as my guest ? POFFY No  --  to permit him to leave Austria , quietly . If you will only say a word to Herr Wreede , the prefect . He 's out at Schnbrunn . And I can swear to you that the Archduke will abide by any arrangement you choose to make . DR . ANTON KRUG ( to ELENA ) So I 'm to go to Schnbrunn and make all the arrangements . p. 138 ELENA Oh , yes , Anton . You must do everything you can to help him . POFFY You will be performing an act of the greatest generosity ! ELENA Yes , Anton . ( ANTON stares at ELENA for a moment , then turns to POFFY . ) DR . ANTON KRUG Will you please wait for me downstairs ? POFFY Yes , Herr Professor Doctor . ( He bows and goes . There is another pause . ) DR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us hope of great wisdom . ELENA Have you any doubt of the wisdom , Anton ? DR . ANTON KRUG Yes , I have , but I must not admit it . ( He is making a gallant attempt to be ironic . ) You see , Elena  --  I am facing the test of my own relentless principles . You 've heard what my students call me : " the messiah of a new faith . " Well  --  to-night I 've heard the bitter injunction that is given to all messiahs : " Physician , heal thyself . " It 's not a comforting thought . However  --  I must go out to Schnbrunn and see Wreede . I must make the necessary arrangements . I sha n't be back before morning . p. 139 ELENA Oh ! DR . ANTON KRUG Yes ! ( He comes close to her . ) You saw the truth , Elena . You saw it , at last , when he goaded me into behaving like  --  like a vindictive ape . You are the only one who can settle it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him , and pity him , as you 'd pity a deluded child ; if you can see him for what he is , and not for what your memory tells you that he was  --  then you 're free . He can never hurt you , whatever he does , or whatever you do . ELENA Very well , Anton . DR . ANTON KRUG ( he stares at her for a moment ) Good-bye , Elena . And tell him not to worry . ( He turns and starts to go . ) Herr Wreede will be glad to do me a favor . His wife is one of my patients . ( He has gone out at the right . ELENA stands still for a moment , then turns and calls , " Rudolf ! Rudolf ! " RUDOLF opens the door and peers out . ELENA crosses to the left . ) ELENA They 've gone . You can come out . ( RUDOLF emerges , still in his shirt sleeves , carrying his uniform coat . His tone during the subsequent scene is elaborately sardonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? p. 140 ELENA Perfectly . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Where is your husband ? ELENA He has gone out . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Where ? ELENA To see the prefect of police . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN And what am I to do in the meanwhile  --  put on my coat and go ? ELENA No . You ca n't . The police are down there . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN They were reluctant to take your husband 's word ? ELENA Yes  --  but you can rely on Anton . He has great influence with the officials . He 'll see to it that you are allowed to leave Austria safely . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( coming down ) So I 'm to rely on him , am I ? ELENA There 's no one else who could do as much for you . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN The soul of magnanimity , is n't he ! ELENA Yes . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN And trustful , too ! ELENA Yes . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN And sublimely confident of your strength . p. 141 ELENA Yes ! RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN And contemptuous of me . ( She says nothing . He throws his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door through which ANTON departed . ) As effective a bit of foul play as I have ever witnessed ! He 's tricked me into his debt  --  put me on my honor . He knows that I have that . It runs in the Habsburg blood  --  honor and epilepsy . We deserved to be thrown out  --  not because we were tyrants , but because we were all at heart rotten sentimentalists . The doctor has discovered the essential weakness . ELENA I told you his method of cure . He influences the patient to advise himself . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Yes  --  and what he has made me advise myself is not very gratifying to my vanity or stimulating to my lecherous impulses . God damn him ! He 's devitalized me , emasculated me . ( He sits down on the end of the couch ; his fury and much of his bumptiousness have gone out of him . ) While I was in there , hiding , waiting for him to protect me from the law , I looked at my coat , and the obsolete medals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawned on me . It came to me in a revelation that I am no longer an Archduke , nephew of an Emperor ; I am a taxi-driver , dressed up ! ELENA And did your revelation also disclose to you what I am now ? p. 142 RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Yes ! You 're no longer a mistress  --  you 're a wife  --  and consequently unprepossessing . ELENA Ah ! You have realized that at last ! RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN I have . ELENA And you know that I can face you , and laugh at you , and pity you , as I 'd pity a deluded child ! RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Do we need to enlarge on it ? If you mean to get satisfaction for all the indignities that I 've lavished on you , you 'll be up all night . Go to bed and leave me alone . I 'll promise to sit here and keep the faith . ELENA ( with sudden tenderness ) You 'd better have some rest . You 'll be travelling in the morning . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Your solicitude is touching . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELENA The police may come back . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN And you want me to know that it would grieve you sorely to have me receive my just deserts . I knew it ! ELENA You 'd better go in there and lie down and try to get some sleep . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN As you wish . ( He rises , crosses to the window , starts to look out upon the Viennese scene , but turns away . ) I shall rest peacefully , soothed by the knowledge that even I have influential friends in Austria . Good night . And when the benevolent doctor returns , please try to express to him some measure of my gratitude . Assure him that , thanks to his generosity , I shall leave Vienna , forever , and return to my taxi . ( He has gone up to the landing at the back . ELENA picks up his coat from the couch. ) p. 143 ELENA You 've forgotten your coat , Rudolf . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Oh , thank you . ELENA ( looking at the coat ) It needs mending . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAXIMILLIAN Please do n't bother . I 'll never wear it again . ELENA You will , Rudolf . You 'll always wear it , gallantly  --  even if the lining is a little torn . It 's your coat . ( She hands him the coat . ) RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Yes ! One of the meagre possessions of Herr von Habsburg ! ( He puts the coat on the balustrade . ) You 're very sweet , Elena . I do n't quite know why you should be , in view of the ridiculous trouble I 've caused . But please remember that I 'm grateful  --  and also sorry . ( She takes his hand . ) ELENA No , Rudolf  --  you must never be sorry . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Good night , my dear . ( He kisses her hand . ) Good-bye . ( He goes into the bedroom . For some moments , she stands still . At length , she picks up his coat , looks at the worn lining and the tarnished medals , hanging limply . Then she turns , switches out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a faint glow from the hallway . She opens the door of her room . The light from within shines on her. ) p. 144 ELENA Rudolf RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( from offstage ) Yes ? ( She goes into the room and closes the door behind her . ) CURTAIN The curtain is down a few seconds to indicate the passage of several hours . Its rise reveals morning , brilliantly sunny , warm and cheerful . KATHIE is completing the arranging of the breakfast table which is at the left of the couch . It is set for three . Old KRUG shuffles in from the left , carrying the morning paper . OLD KRUG ( disgusted ) Just as I thought ! Not a word in here about what happened last night . One of the most exciting things that 's happened in this city in years , and then they hush it up . ( He sniffs and his expression changes . ) Mm ! Kidneys ! KATHIE You 're not to touch them ! They are for the Herr Professor Doctor . OLD KRUG I thought as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , KRUG follows her , talking . ) OLD KRUG Oh , Kathie ! ( She pauses . ) What did you think of our guest , eh ? Did you ever see any one like that before ? p. 145 KATHIE ( scornfully ) No ! ( She resumes her exit . ) OLD KRUG I never did , either  --  I mean , close to . How did they get rid of him ? What happened after I went to bed ? ( He is following her out . ) KATHIE ( from offstage ) I have n't the faintest idea what happened ! OLD KRUG ( from offstage ) Well  --  I 'd surely like to know . But it 's a sure thing no one 's going to tell me . Did n't you hear anything ? ( RUDOLF comes out of the room at the back , and deposits his cape and his hat on the balustrade . KRUG , still mumbling , returns . ) I 've got to find out all these things for myself . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Good morning . Good morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good morning , and I can assure you I do so with the most profound sincerity . ( KRUG sees who it is , and is so startled he can only gape . RUDOLF goes to the window and looks out . ) It has been years since I have seen one like it . You know , it 's an extraordinary thing about Vienna ; in no other place on earth will you find a finer quality of mornings . They 're ample , they 're complete ! They have character . Look at this one ! It 's a new day  --  and , do n't forget , that 's very different from saying " another day . " You never hear people in Vienna say " another day has dawned , " do you ? For that 's precisely like saying " another Chinaman has been born , " an exact reproduction of all the countless millions and millions of Chinamen that have been born and lived and died . It 's an appalling thought , is n't it ? ( He crosses toward the breakfast table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing . ) No , my dear friend  --  we Viennese are privileged beings . For us , each morning is an adventure , unprecedented and unforgettable . A new day ! ( He inspects the array of breakfast . ) What have we here ? p. 146 OLD KRUG ( weakly ) I thought Your Imperial Highness had gone . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN What led you to that misconception ? ( He is looking at the various dishes . ) OLD KRUG After the police had left , I heard the front door close again . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN That was the excellent Herr Professor , going forth to clear the atmosphere . Ah ! Kidneys . ( He takes the dish and sits down . ) OLD KRUG Those are for my son ! RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN He likes kidneys , does he ? ( He has begun to eat them . ) OLD KRUG He does  --  and no one is allowed to touch RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Please sit down . ( KRUG sits across the table . ) You know , the more I hear about that gifted scientist , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and taste . He and I obviously appreciate the same delicacies . OLD KRUG Where did you sleep last night ? RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Now really , my friend  --  you 're a man of the world , are n't you ? p. 147 OLD KRUG ( indignantly ) I am nothing of the kind . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN I envy you . It 's a poor world . You do well to keep out of it . If you take my advice , you 'll stay here , where you are , in this charming house , in this incomparable city , with a view of the horse-chestnuts ; and leave investigation of the world to those who have no place else to go . ( ELENA comes in . She is radiant . ) Ah ! Our lovely hostess ! OLD KRUG Look , Elena ! Look at who is having breakfast with me ! ELENA Good morning , father . Good morning , Rudolf . ( She waves toward the window . ) Gorgeous , is n't it ? RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN We 've been discussing it , at some length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could n't make out what he was talking about . ( ELENA has come down to the table and taken possession of the coffee pot . ) ELENA Will you have coffee , Rudolf ? RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Oh  --  I 'll have everything : coffee , with whipped cream , rolls , honey , jam , jelly . ( To KRUG . ) By the way , did you ever know why it was that our bakers started making rolls in the shape of crescents ? ( KRUG shakes his head . ) It was intended as an expression of our contempt for the Turks . ( He is holding up a crescent roll while he talks. ) p. 148 OLD KRUG Was it really ! ( He takes a bite of a roll , and munches it reflectively , as though appreciating for the first time its full flavor . ) RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Oh , I could tell you many similar facts of historical importance . For instance  --  about the Serbian pigs ELENA ( interrupting ) I 've forgotten whether you take sugar . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughs heartily . ) ELENA Father ! What are you laughing at ? OLD KRUG He said he 'd forgotten if he takes sugar . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN I do n't blame you for laughing ! I do n't blame you a bit . It was a fatuous remark . OLD KRUG What ? RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN A very silly remark . As a matter of fact , I take three lumps . ( They all laugh at that . ) ELENA ( to KRUG ) He 's a fool , is n't he ? OLD KRUG I should say that he is ! Why , do you know what he said about the morning ? He said it was like a lot of Chinamen ! ( He laughs uproariously . So do ELENA and RUDOLF . The merriment is interrupted when ANTON comes in , accompanied by POFFY. ) p. 149 DR . ANTON KRUG Good morning . ELENA Anton ! ( She rises and crosses to ANTON . ) OLD KRUG ( pointing to RUDOLF ) Look at this , Anton RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Before any one else breaks the news , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ELENA Kathie will cook some more . Sit down , Anton  --  and you too , Poffy . DR . ANTON KRUG No , I 've already had a huge breakfast at the Hotel Lucher . But I 'm afraid this gentleman has n't . He has been standing out in the street all night . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Why in heaven 's name have you been doing that ? POFFY The police were still there , and I thought I might be needed . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN And you were ready to die for your Prince . Such gallantry must not pass unnoticed . ( He unpins a medal from his coat and tosses it to POFFY , who catches it . ) OLD KRUG ( wide-eyed ) Did you see that ! RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN You say you 've been at Lucher 's ? p. 150 DR . ANTON KRUG Yes . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Is the party still going on ? DR . ANTON KRUG Oh Lord , yes . They all entertained me at breakfast . ELENA How are they now ? DR . ANTON KRUG They 're getting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then let 's rush over and wake them up ! ( KRUG starts up , hopefully . ) DR . ANTON KRUG I 'm afraid we ca n't . I mean , you and I. RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN Oh ! DR . ANTON KRUG We have to start immediately for Passau , where you will be allowed to cross the frontier . There 's a government car downstairs . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN I see . DR . ANTON KRUG I hate to drag you away . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN ( rising ) But it 's necessary . Of course it is . Do I have to wear that cape and that hat ? ELENA Yes  --  help him , father . ( Rising , KRUG throws his napkin down. ) p. 151 OLD KRUG Oh , dear ! Now he has to go ! ELENA But why do you have to go with him , Anton ? RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN I flatly refuse to hear of such a thing ! I will not take you away from your duties , your home . Poffy will escort me . POFFY I should be delighted to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word that I myself will see you depart from Austria . The authorities wished me to explain that they will take extraordinary precautions to see that you do not return . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN I do n't blame them . I do n't blame them a bit . Thank you . ( This to old KRUG , who has brought him his hat and cape . ) DR . ANTON KRUG ( to ELENA ) I sha n't be back much before evening . Will you tell Zenzi to cancel all my engagements for today ? ELENA Yes , Anton . I 'll tell her . And I 'll send word to the university . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN A dutiful wife , Herr Professor . I commend her to you  --  and you to her . It is a remarkable union , and it will give me satisfaction to the end of my days to think that perhaps I , in my small way , have contributed something to it . p. 152 ELENA It 's time to go , Rudolf . RUDOLF MAXIMILLIAN I know it is . But before I depart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your roof tree blessed ! For beneath it , a Habsburg has been entertained  --  royally entertained  --  and has been granted , into the bargain , a superb demonstration of applied psychology . Good-bye , Elena . ( He kisses her hand . ) No wistful tears , please . ( He crosses to POFFY , who bows and kisses RUDOLF 'S hand . ) Good-bye , Poffy . If you sell that medal for a sou less than a thousand francs , I shall be insulted . ( RUDOLF slaps POFFY on the back and crosses to old KRUG , who is by the door at the right . ) Good-bye , my dear friend . Think of me in the mornings . ( He kisses old KRUG on both cheeks and goes out at the right . POFFY and KRUG go up to the window . ) DR . ANTON KRUG ( to ELENA ) There 'll be no trouble . ELENA Anton  --  there 's something I want to say DR . ANTON KRUG ( hastily ) No , there is n't , Elena . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at you . ( He takes her hand . ) I must hurry . p. 153 ELENA Yes , Anton  --  but I wanted to say  --  when you get to the frontier , ask him to give you back my wedding ring . DR . ANTON KRUG I shall . And I left a package for you in the hall . Frau Lucher gave it to me . It 's your white dress . ( He kisses ELENA 'S hand and goes out . ) OLD KRUG ( at the window ) A government car  --  with the shades drawn ! ( ELENA goes over to the table and sits down , wilfully indifferent to old KRUG 'S excited reports of what is happening in the street below . ) ELENA Sit down , Poffy , and have some breakfast . You must be famished . POFFY ( crossing to the table ) I rather imagine that I am . ( POFFY sits down . ELENA looks at the empty dish . ) OLD KRUG They 're just starting  --  and the policeman is saluting them ! ELENA All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll tell Kathie to cook some more . OLD KRUG Enough for me , too ? ( Pressing the bell button. ) p. 154 ELENA Of course . OLD KRUG Good ! ( He is ambling over to the table . ) ELENA ( pouring coffee ) Cream ? POFFY No , thanks , Elena . I 've got out of the habit of cream . ( She hands him the cup . ) OLD KRUG You know , Elena  --  I 've never , in all my life , had so much fun ! ELENA Neither have I. ( She smiles at old KRUG , then sips her coffee. )
