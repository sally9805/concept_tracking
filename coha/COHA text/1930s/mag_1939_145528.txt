That job has been vacant since 1924 when the last Caliph , Turkey 's Abdul Medjid II , was booted out by Turkey 's late Dictator Kamal Ataturk . Carefully schooled , sporty King Farouk has frequently taken time off from golf and duck shooting ( see cut ) to attend " Cairo 's mosques in an effort to convince the Moslem world of his fitness for the Caliphate . <P> Last week the young King , attended 500 of his army officers , not only attend the service in Cairo 's Quoson Mosque but donned the robes of an imam , the prayer leader , and read the prayers to the congregation .

" <P> Since the Moslem hierarchy of Saudi Arabia , Palestine , Transjordan , Syria , Turkey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the choice of a Caliph , to cheers were premature but it was significant that among those cheering were Farouk 's guests , the Emir of Yemen , Self-al-Islam Hussein , and Emir Feisal , the son of Saudi Arabia 's King , Ibn Saud .
