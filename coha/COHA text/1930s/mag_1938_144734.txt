" The only skyscraping girls ' school in the world ' ' is small ( 600 students ) Mundelein College , which is lodged near Lake Michigan in a 15-story building on Chicago 's North Side . A popular teacher of physics and botany at Mundelein is Sister Mary Therese , member of the Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary , daughter of a Chicago contractor . When Mundelein moved into its skyscraper in 1930 , it was seen that only two of its three elevator shafts would be needed for vertical traffic . This gave bespectacled Sister Mary , who was then in her late 205 , an idea . Last week , in the idle elevator shaft , installed and ready to operate was a 120-foot Foucault pendulum , the longest in existence . <P> French Physicist Jean Bernard Leon Foucault ( 1819-68 ) installed the first Foucault pendulum in Paris 's Pantheon in 1851 . That one , since dismantled , was 200 feet long . Foucault 's idea was to prove the rotation of Earth on its axis . A pendulum which is swinging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compass directions beneath the pendulum are constantly changing as the earth rotates . This apparent shift was duly performed by the pendulum of Jean Bernard Leon Foucault . Such demonstrations always make a great impression on students of elementary physics . <P> Sister Mary persuaded her superiors to provide the money for a pendulum to occupy nine stories in the unused shaft . The chromium-plated bob weighs 30 pounds , makes one back- &-forth; oscillation through an arc of about six feet every twelve seconds . At the centre of the swing , the bob passes close to a waxed indicator table , and by means of a high voltage transformer an electric spark is passed from the bob to the wax , makes a mark showing the amount of rotation every hour-or oftener if desired for demonstration purposes . To start the pendulum going , without torque , it is held at one end of its arc by a string which is then burned through ( see cut ) . <P> Scientists are now generally agreed that the earth rotates on its axis , and the speed of rotation has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be something more than a mere exhibition . Since a pendulum 's rate of oscillation depends on the force of gravity at the point where it operates , it will keep a constant record of the force of gravity for the Chicago area . <P> * Holding a match to burn the cord which releases the pendulum . The four wires from which the bob hangs are barely visible in the picture .
