A loud rap sounded one evening last week at the door of a banquet room in Manhattan 's Waldorf-Astoria in which sat Utilities Tycoon Harvey Crowley Couch , Munitions Tycoon Alexis Felix du Pont , Herbert Lee Pratt , onetime board chairman of Socony-Vacuum Oil Co. , President Charles K. Davis of Remington Arms Co. , some 200 other big &; little wigs . A waiter opened the door , and in waddled Field &; Stream 's hearty Publisher Eltinge F. Warner disguised as Donald Duck , with a large basket on his arm . Squawking , he advanced to the speaker 's table , pumped the hand of Connecticut 's onetime Senator Frederic Walcott who was presiding as toastmaster , launched into a falsetto speech acknowledging the gratitude of ducks for what the diners were doing for them . This done , he started for the door , stumbled , dropped his basket . Out popped three live wild ducks , which went flapping up &; down the room to the hilarious confusion of the distinguished but convivial banqueters . <P> Thus was launched the first annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Founded by 33 sportsmen in 1935 to help Government and private conservation agencies preserve and restore the nation 's wildlife , the Institute has had backing from arms , sporting goods , automobile and other manufacturers interested in preserving the $500,000,000 business of U. S. hunting &; fishing . Its chief accomplishment to date , financed by a $150,000 Remington Arms donation , has been initiation of game breeding research projects in nine agricultural colleges . <P> Despite the opening horseplay , at last week 's Duck Dinner every diner except one was dead serious about the problem of North America 's diminishing wild ducks . The lone , tipsy dissenter held up proceedings for ten minutes while he argued with great gravity that the press of urgent civic problems made duck discussion trivial if not unpatriotic . Earnest conservationists listened with growing restlessness as other speakers deplored the duck decrease , bemoaned the fact that since most ducks breed in Canada there is little the U. S. can do about it . The audience wanted something constructive . They got it when 260-lb . Ira Noel Gabrielson , Chief of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * <P> Chief Gabrielson , an expert who has been with the Survey since 1915 , reviewed its New Deal program of restoring marsh land for duck breeding grounds and refuges . Minimum requirement , said he , is 7,500,000 acres . The Survey is about halfway to that goal . But , continued the broad-beamed Chief , " there are two small groups among people who hunt who may defeat this program . " One group is composed of commercial hunters , usually petty thieves and miscreants . " So long as a section of the American public will pay exorbitant prices for contraband game in restaurants , night clubs and hotels , we will have this problem to deal with . "
