txt A statement by Prof. Erich Kauffman , the Austrian counsel defending AustroGerman customs union , that the Council of the League of Nations itself urged Austria in 1925 to reach a commercial agreement of the closest possible character with the so-called succession states , drew from the French counsel , M. Paul-Boucour , today . the contention that under the terms of the Geneva protocol of 1923 , governing conditions for restoration of Austrian finances , no customs union whatever is permitted . This assertion set various judges vigorously jotting down notes , M. Boncour later modified it , however , by claiming that Auitria might bid for a customs union , subject to consent of the League Council . The shadow of a political union between Austria and Germany , which is illegal under treaties except with the unanimous approval of the League Council , hovers over the case . Thus on one hand Professor Kauffman contended that the charge of violation of Austrian dependence fell to the ground since it was specifically stated in the Vienna agreement that approval of both parliaments is needed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintained in fact that it was his opponent 's objections which were in violation of Austria 's independence , since they deny Austria 's right to exercise its sovereignty . He denied an ulterior motive of a customs move . M. Boncour on the other hand referred to the proposed article in the German constitution at Weimar in 1919 , which originally provided for representation of Austria in the German imperial council , after a union with Germany should have taken place , but which was suppressed after protsst of the former allied nations . According to M. Boncour , Article 88 of the St. Germaine protocol was especially provided to eliminate the danger of an Austro-German political union , which might lead to disorganization of European order. ?
