The U. S. Government ran goo million dollars into the red in fiscal 1931 . When April came this year it was 1,885 new millions in the red for fiscal 1932 . When April went it was 448 more new millions behind ( mostly Reconstruction Finance loans ) . All these millions-2,333 of them and more to come before June 30-will be lumped with the Public Debt for future generations to pay off . <P> Months ago President Hoover , obviously endorsed by public sentiment , and joined by even the ill-organized , quarrelsome House of Representatives in its famed standing vote of March 29 , resolved that in fiscal 1933 the U. S. must spend no more than it takes in , that the Budget must balance . Three consecutive , mounting deficits would certainly impair the public credit . <P> Last week , a month after the House 's famed rising vote , the prospect of the 1933 Budget being brought to balance by Congress was never more remote . Lobbyists had taken the place of leaders . An atmosphere of confusion and delay permeated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for War widows . Cost : $100,000,000 in five years . <P> The House passed a bill to inflate commodity prices by deflating the dollar ( see p. 16 ) . <P> The House finished with the President 's economy bill . Out of proposed savings of $210,000,000 it agreed to only $30,000,000 . " It goes to prove , " said the defeated Democrat in charge of the bill ( Alabama 's McDuffie ) , " that . . . representative government is dead . " <P> <P> The Senate Finance Committee was still fumbling fruitlessly with the House 's jumbled tax bill . After two weeks fumbling the Senators were dismayed to find their bill still 100 million shy of the mark . <P> " Will of the Country . " Since Congress convened in December , President Hoover had made 20 public statements on Economy &; Taxation . Suddenly , sharply he now sent up Capitol Hill a 21st pronouncement . Said he : <P> ' ' Fear and alarm prevail because of events in Washington which have greatly disturbed the public mind . . . . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put more heart into the country than prompt and courageous and united action . . . . The details plainly require : 1 ) prompt enactment of a revenue bill ... to distribute the burdens equitably ; 2 ) a drastic program of economy . . . $230,000,000 below the executive budget . . . . <P> " The Government can not be dictated to by organized minorities . ... I know these actions do not reflect the will of the country and I refuse to believe that the country is unable to reflect its will in legislation . " <P> Democrats , writhed and winced . Hotly they retorted that this message was the President 's first campaign speech for reelection . Nevertheless , the outlook for Economy &; Taxation suddenly cleared on Capitol Hill . Within a few hours the following took place : <P> The House , in committee , finally rejected all plans for paying off the Soldier Bonus in cash ( $2,400,000,000 in addition to all other billions ) . <P> The Senate , in committee , met with Secretary Mills and in three hours whipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " should assure a balanced budget in the sense that there will be no additional borrowings during 1933 . " <P> For the moment , Capitol Hill seemed safe for Public Credit .
