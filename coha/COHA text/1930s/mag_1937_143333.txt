He was catlike and solitary , as he was artistic and amorous . . . . Feline . . . is the adjective most used to suggest his walk , his manner , his particular kind of acrid wit , his playfulness , his sulks , and , most of all , the voluptuousness that colored his whole relation to life and art . <P> This engaging character was Achille-Claude Debussy , who died in 1918 . He had to wait until last week and the appearance of his first American biography*-his third in English-for a book that would do justice to his lush Bohemian personality and his stature as a composer . Author Thompson , music critic of the New York Sun , paints an intimate picture . Debussy not only resembled a cat ; he lived with live cats and collected porcelain cats . His living cats were always grey angoras , always named Line . His women were less uniform . To him the four most important were Mme Vasnier , wife of an aging friend , who brought him from adolescence to manhood ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked on his opera , Pelleas et Melisande ; Rosalie Texier ( Wife No. 1 ) , who had an unpleasant voice which finally got on his nerves ; Emma Bardac ( Wife No. 2 ) , a singer with a pleasant voice who lived with him until his death . <P> In other personal respects M. Debussy was equally Bohemian . A short-legged , thick-set man , seldom in funds , he was forever wandering indolently into Left Bank and Montmartre cafes . There he would sit in a cape and large felt hat , ordering rarebits and English ale , rolling his own cigarets . He preferred the circus to the opera , and disliked listening to music , though he accepted several jobs writing music criticism for Paris publications . He finally succumbed to cancer of the rectum one spring when Big Bertha was dropping shells into Paris . <P> But this same M. Debussy was a hardworking , painstaking composer and in music a revolutionist , if not of a very red dye . Hating the emotionalism of Wagner and other romantic composers , he created a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from nature , conceived a whole new palette of instrumental and harmonic colors . Critics , fond of loose similes , called him a symbolist like Poets Mallarme and Verlaine ; others called him an impressionist like Painters Renoir and Monet . The latter title stuck . His work-fastidious , poetic , voluptuous and all but perfection in technique-had an immense influence on the composers of the early nineteen hundreds . Besides a picture of an incurable Bohemian , Biographer Thompson offers a systematic critical study of all of his compositions , from the slightest piano piece to L'Aprs-midi d'un Faune and Pelleas et Melisande . <P> <P> *DEBUSSY : MAN AND ARTIST , by Oscar Thompson , Dodd , Mead ( $3.50 ) .
