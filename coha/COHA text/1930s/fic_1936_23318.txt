grgweck9 HOW BRIDIE 'S GIRL WAS WON A STORY BY KAY BOYLE MHERE is no sand on this part of the I coast , but a shingled beach on which the sea calls deeply , loudly forever . Ah-h-h-h-h goes the long , deep sighing of the water , and the waveful of stones shudders back into the tide . Ah-h-h-h-h goes the hollow warble of the sea withdrawing , and the fishing boats return and their sails fold down at the edge like petals shrivelling in the cold . One man , or two , jumps down from them as their keels strike , leaps hip-deep into the white water , and hauls the craft up from the shuddering echo of the stones . Ah-h-h-h-h goes the murmur of the water , and as it dies the boats ride inward , their guts a-gleam with the light-bellied fish they carry . The fishermen draw them up over the golden ribbons of seaweed to where the sea no longer comes . " They catch them in June at Shetland , " the fisherman with the beaked nose said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in November at Folkstone , and then to the southward up to the month of Feb-ruary . " This was the news they were waiting for every night in the pub , to come by word of mouth , or by letter even , or over the radio to them . Or in the daytime , when the nets were mended and the rain blowing as usual , the men came into the pub and sat there with their beer or without it and talked of the weather and of when the herring would be likely to come . In the summer the women had time to walk in without hats for a glass of beer or to watch their husbands drinking ; but now that it was winter there were only the fishermen left and this one woman with her hair cut short like a man 's and wearing riding breeches . " We 'll know suddenly like , " the fisherman with the beaked nose said . He was not a young man any longer , with the texture and brine of sea in the leather of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose , and his little eyes rimmed with red . " There may be a change in the weather , " he said , " and before you can pull your boots on , the herring ' 11 be there . " The woman was standing at the bar with the others , a smart-looking , rich-looking woman lighting her cigarette for herself under the big framed picture of the King . His Majesty was in khaki , his beard tinted almost golden , his cheeks like the petals of roses , and a travesty of Viking strength in his pretty , painted face . " Look here , " said the woman to the fisherman as she slipped her lighter into her pocket . " You have a drink with me , the lot of you . " " All of us ? Everyone in the place ? " asked the fisherman , speaking in reverence to her . " Yes , the lot , " said the woman . " I want to get acquainted . " " Her 's giving a drink , " he said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . " What 'll it be then ? Her asks what it 'll be . " He turned back to her , rubbing his hands together , and watched her eagerly . He watched her call the pub-keeper and order what they wanted , watching her as if in fear that a change in her face might say her mind had altered . But there was her short nose , and her good chin , and her closed mouth holding the cigarette , unflinching . She was not very tall , a woman of thirty maybe , with a head of her own and a worldly way that went well with the clothes she was wearing . Once she had opened her purse and paid the pub-keeper over the bar , the fisherman with the beaked nose looked more respectfully at her and chose his language with care . " Word ought to be along any day now , " he said to her , " and then we 'll know whether to steer north or southward for them . " He picked up his glass of ale and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red , unhappy eyes . " Cheerio , " he said dismally , and all the fishermen in the bar picked up their glasses and said " Cheerio " in voices as melancholy as the weather that fell endlessly against the panes . And another day in the week this word came to them : that the herring gulls had left the ports to the north and were traveling southward . They were thick as thieves off Weymouth , the fisherman with the beaked nose was telling her , and the next word might be that the herrings themselves were moving down the coast . The woman stood at the bar in her riding breeches beside him , and her yellow oilskin coat hung down to her heels behind . There were two dogs lying at her feet , two feathery red spaniels with their hair waved dark and drenching by the rain ; and save for them and the two people standing , there was no one else in the place . " My son , he telephoned me last night from Weymouth , " said the fisherman to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm over there . Did you ever run across my son ? " he asked . " A big fine-looking man with black eyes and a fine head of hair ? A well set-up fellow when you see him ? " " No , " said the woman , hiking up her breeches , " I do n't think I ever met anyone like that round here . " There were only the spaniels tenderly licking their feet on the boards of the floor , but the fisherman hesitated a moment before speaking . " He was going to get married , " he said then , looking down at the varnished wood where his empty glass was standing , " but everything goes queer with him someway . " His voice passed low between them . " Everything was set for it  --  the ring and the house . They were going to get married in April or May . " " Look here , " said the woman sharply , and the dogs raised their heads at the sound of her voice , " what about a drink with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fisherman when the pub-keeper had come and gone , " my son 's never had a mother to look to him . " He wiped his nose on the back of his hand and leaned on the bar beside her . " My wife , she died , and everything went up in smoke like , and here was this lad . Well it 's always been women , " said the fisherman , tasting his beer . " First one and then another . And then he took up with this girt , and she was a nice girl , and I could n't do enough for them . I gave them the house and I got Bridie his own boat , and he was going to settle down for good and all . " The door of the pub opened in from the rain , and a fisherman , with the stench of fish on him and the crablike legs of a sailing-man , came into the bar and shook off the rain from his visored hat . The woman in her riding breeches and the fisherman with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar . " Hello , Watrus , " said the fisherman standing at the bar . He pushed his own hat back from his short , gray fringe of HOW BRIDLE 'S hair . " Here 's she as give I and all a drink of beer last week . " " Pleased to meet she , " said the fisherman . He stood a little way from them in respect , and he smiled at her under his stained mustaches . " I was n't here last week , and that 's a fact 'm . The skipper 'll tell you that 's so . " " Have a drink now then , " said the woman . " My name 's Stephens  --  I call myself Mrs. Stephens . " " Pleased to meet you , " said the little old fisherman , taking his hat off . He stood looking at the rouge painted on her lips and the pure white shirt , and the yellow-satin tie at her neck with the hound dogs patterned on it , brown and white , crying after the scent . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the beaked nose , and the other man shook his head and his eyes shone bright at the sight of the beer set down on the counter . " Bridle 's the finest man on the coast , " he said . He smoothed back his mustaches with the crooked side of his hand and he lifted his glass up . " Cheerio , " he said , and his lips closed eagerly with love upon the bitters at the brim . " What I was saying was , Bridie 's girl , she run off , " said Bridie 's father in a low voice . " That was n't any kind of a trick to play on a fine upstanding man like Bridie . Everything was as good as done , and she runs off with another man . " " Why did n't he go after her ? " asked Mrs. Stephens , smoking . Bridie 's father thought of that for a moment , drinking slowly at his beer , and then he said : " I ca n't tell you that . Bridie , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's his pride . He has a lot of pride , has Bridie . " " Oh , has he ? " said Mrs. Stephens . She looked down , wondering , at the clean light toe of her leather riding shoe . " He could have fought that man and beat him if the fellow had ever come out and said what he wanted , " said Bridie 's father . " But that fellow , he goes off atnight with the girl , and when Bridie goes to fetch her on a Sunday , she 's gone since the night before . They run off in the fellow 's car . " " If he 's anything like a man he ought to fight for her , " said Mrs. Stephens . She snapped her cigarette case open and took one out . " Bridle 's as good as any man in the country , " said his father without anger . " His girl did n't think so , " said Mrs. Stephens with a smile . " Her was n't near good enough for Bridle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened fast , as if from a gust of wind , and another man came blowing in . He was tall and broad , with his eyes as black as tar in his face , and his fisherman 's leather-billed cap set rakishly on his head . A dark-blue seaman 's sweater was rolled almost to his ears , and his black oilskin hung careless as a cloak from his shoulders . " Here , Bridie , when did you get in I " said his father , and Bridle came swinging across the public room with a cigarette in the end of his mouth . He put his hand down flat on the varnished bar , and the sound of money rang out , and he said : " Here you are . Everyone has a drink with me now . The herring 's come . I seen them . You , " he called nut to the pub-keeper who came in from the dining room , " bring us half a pint of bitters all round . What are you drinking , lady ? A pink gent Ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen the herring , " he said , talking fast . He leaned on the bar between Mrs. Stephens and his father , head and shoulders taller than the other man , his cheeks fresh and wet from the rain , his black eyes gay . " Saw they ? " said Watrus with a burst of laughter in his mustaches . " Thousands of them , " said Bridie , flinging his arm out . " They 're getting the boats out now . You drink fast . I seen them resting on the sand at the bottom , thousands on thousands of them , shedding down their roe . You and Dad 'll come with me . My boat 's as good as on the water . I seen them this morning , just before sunrise . They rose up like a flock of sheep and started southward . " Mrs. Stephens stood there near to him , smoking her cigarette , and watching him : watching the beer run quickly into his strong brown throat , watching his manly , dark-haired hand on his glass , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flashing eye . " They 'll be up with the rising of the moon to-night , " he said . " Bring us another half-pint all round . " He paid his money out flat on the bar , and the pub-keeper said : " It 's five minutes to closing time . " " Five minutes is four and a half minutes too long for us , " said Bridic , talking quickly . " There 's a fortune out there , and we 're going to bring it in . Come on , drink fast , drink fast , old men , " he said . " Drink it up , lady . We 're going to sweep the sea clean and pick ' em off like daisies . " " Look here , " said the woman in riding breeches . " I think I 'll go out there with you . " " Sure , " said Bridie , but when he looked at her something like shyness altered his eye . " The sea 's like glass this afternoon , and it 's freshening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-night . " " This is she as give I and all a drink one night last week , " said his father , and Bridie 's teeth went suddenly white in his face as he looked down into the young woman 's face and tilted his hat and smiled . It did not seem as if there were clouds above their heads , but as if this were the somber color of the heavens , this wide , unchanging . ashen tide of sky that flowed without barrier into the wide , unchanging , ashen tide of sea . The air was cold and , in spite of the fact that the rain had ceased , it was wringing wet on the hair and mouth . The fleet of boats went separately out across the water , and the nets were spread and allowed to drift withthe movement of the current . And then the action of the men , and of Bridie even , lapsed like a lull in the breeze . Every plank of Bridie 's boat and every inch of rope was spangled with the silvery dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the night before that . They were clinging even to the coats and the boots that Bridie 's father and Watrus wore . Mrs. Stephens sat in the tar-stained belly of the yawl with a great fur coat buttoned up to her chin and a cigarette in her fingers . Beyond them rode the other boats , and behind stood the smoke-white cliffs of the coast with the gulls hovering high , in clear , gleaming crescents of light against the heavens ' darkness . The two old fishermen were seated in the stem , and only when they cautiously now and again pulled the nets toward the surface , was any movement made . Bridie stood not far from Mrs. Stephens , filling his pipe up and looking out to sea , and the boat rocked gently , gently on the water , gentle as a cradle rocking in a quiet still unlighted room . " Look here , " said Mrs. Stephens suddenly out of the stillness to Bridie . " What 's this about your girl turning you down ? " Bridie 's face flashed quickly toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who 's been talking ? " he said . He stood holding the bowl of his pipe in his brown , hare hand , his oilskin falling loose from his shoulders , and his visored hat set sideways on his short black , lively hair . " Look here , " said the woman again , and she crossed her legs in their leather boots and stretched them out before her . " I like you . Sit down here a minute . I just got kicked into the middle of next week myself . My husband 's divorcing me . " She made a little face at him , and Bridie looked at her , and then he sat slowly down . " What 's over 's done with , " he said in a moment . " I 'm not wasting any time thinking about her . " He put his pipe in the corner of his mouth and felt for a match in his pockets . " Here 's my lighter , " said Mrs. Stephens and leaned forward with the little flame in her hand . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sitting back and smoking . " I 've always given women the go-by , and here this little chit , she up and runs out on me . " " Yes , " said Mrs. Stephens quietly , " that 's just how it is . " " She was the Queen of the Carnival this year , " said Bridle , and he looked out , half-smiling , half-grieving , over the darkening sea . " She had her dress all the way down from London , from a theatrical costumer 's . You 've never seen anything like the way the fellows went on about her . She had them all knocked silly . " " She 's a great beauty , is she ? " said Mrs. Stephens a little bitterly , but curiously as well . " That was the whole trouble , " said Bridie . " I never knew where I was with her . I might have known the way things would go in the end . " " That 's the way I felt about my husband , " said Mrs. Stephens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He should never have married anyone . But I went through everything with himeverything  --  and now he has started proceedings ! Can you imagine it ? He 's divorcing met " " Good riddance to bad rubbish is what I says , " said Bridle , folding his arms over . " I suppose I do too , " said Mrs. Stephens . She gave a little laugh and took another cigarette from her case . " Look here , " she said . " What do you think you 'll do next ? " " Who ? Me ? " asked Bridie , looking at her in surprise . " Oh , I 'll recover . Her going away has n't made ten minutes ' difference in the time I get up in the morning or the time I go to bed . I 'm not losing any sleep or getting any gray hairseither over that young lady , I 'll tell you , " he said with a little grunt of scorn . " Of course , you have your work to do , you have your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If I had any work I might think of it that way too . " She looked down at her hands , as if asking help of them . " But my husband and I , we did n't live separate lives , we just lived one life together . Whatever he did I . helped him at it . We were together all day  --  riding together , walking together , painting together . You see , he did a little painting . " " You mean houses ? " asked Bridle . " No . I mean pictures , " said Mrs. Stephens . " He loved the wind and the sun and the rain , " said Mrs. Stephens in a low , pain-tightened voice . " We liked the same things , always , five years of it , " she said , " and then this absurd thing happened . " Bridie was looking out over the sea and thinking of the weather , and the boat rocked gently , gently on the softly running tide . " I ca n't get used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and when he looked back at the sound of her voice , she made another small wry face at him and laughed . " What am I going to do about it ? " " Well , you just look at me , " said Bridle , shifting on the seat and spreading his shoulders wide . " The first few days I took it pretty hard , but after that I pulled myself together . I wo n't make no secret of it . I went blotto , as they says , for five days , but after that I straightened up . They were talking about a ship up at Weymouth , and I went up there to sec her . That was a sight , I tell you ! " His eyes were on Mrs. Stephens as he talked , Hark and bold and almost merry . " She 'd touched at St. Michael 's on her way home and laid three weeks there , " said Bridie , " and there the goose-barnacles had fastened on her and she was covered thick with them from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , good as armor , it wasl Well , do you know , they had n't been able to make two miles an hour , even with the wind , from the weight of the barnacles on her , and they were putting her up for sale once her cargo was discharged . " " Yes , I suppose that was a great help at the time , " said Mrs. Stephens , looking down at her hands . " But you see nobody ever brought a barnacled ship along to take my mind off my husband when he went away . Waking or sleeping , night or day , I ca n't think of anything but him . I want him back , and that 's all I can think of . " The two men at the other end of the boat had got to their feet again and were stooping over in the failing light to raise the nets and peer within them , and Bridie rose uneasily and moved behind Mrs. Stephens and Laid hold of the rope hanging into the water from the stern . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called in a low voice down the length of the boat to him , and the three men cautiously and in rhythm drew the dripping ends of the cotton nets in and folded them on the timber . " Not a sign , " said Watrus from the stem , and Bridie 's father called out , " Let ' er go , Bridle . " The three men fed out the nets again , in rhythm , into the lapping , quiet sea . There was the free , wild taste of salt on the air as Bridie returned and sat down again beside her . " Sure , " he said . " I know how you feel about it . But the worst of it is , I ca n't get it out of my head that this bloke she went off with , he was a toff . How 's that going to end for her , I 'd like to know ? She 's got the looks all right to carry anything off , but you ca n't tell me she could step as high as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The evening was deepening now over the water , and the buoys lighting , single and clear and distant as stars . Far at the end of the land , the pale white wings of the semaphore lifted and fell and lifted . Slowly , like planets rising , the lights began burning below the fading cliffs in the windows of the town . " I know , " said Mrs. Stephens . " I 'm sure they could n't be happy together . " He was sitting so close to her , his elbows leaning on his knees and his oilskins gleaming , that she saw the smile that went suddenly white across his dark-burned face . " I bet she could carry it off , at that , " he said . He might never have known that Mrs. Stephens was there or that she had spoken . " I bet she could sit down at table with royalty even and nobody 'd see the difference . " " Look here , " said Mrs. Stephens abruptly . " Did you ever think of doing yourself in , Bridie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , starting back . " Who , me ? " " I think about it all the time , " said Mrs. Stephens in a trembling voice . " I take a drink to forget about it , and then I feel more I ike it than ever . If I do n't get my husband back I 'm going to do it . I 've picked out the cliff . It 's right over there , " she said , pointing into the darkness . " You need a change maybe , " said Bridle , uneasily . " You need a change of scene , as the saying goes , maybe . " " This is my change of scene , " said Mrs. Stephens . " I came down from London to get away from where we 'd lived together . I came down here to the coast to think things out and try to square my shoulders . " She looked toward him in the dark and tried to grin at him . " Well , I do n't seem to be squaring them , do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman , " said Bridie . Only the whites of his eyes and his teeth , white as a dog 's teeth as he smiled uneasily , were left of him in the gathering dark . " Women do n't take things so lightly , that is , some women . " " Oh , do n't they ? " said Mrs. Stephens . " Look here , Bridie , " she said . " Kiss me . They ca n't see from the other end . " " Who cares if they do ? " said Bridie , bold and reckless , and he put his arms quickly around her . He kissed her hard and long on the mouth , and the leather bill of his rakish hat struck the top of her head and rolled off down between them . " You 've got beautiful hair , " said Mrs. Stephens , drawing away in a minute . " By God , " said Bridie , breathing hard . Mrs. Stephens took a cigarette from her case and put it between her lips . " Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm afraid my lighter has perished . " He took out a box from his pocket and struck one on it , and she saw his hand was shaking as he held the flame from the breeze . With the light of it between them , they looked into each other 's faces , and Bridie stooped forward in confusion and picked up his hat from the bottom of the boat and put it on the side of his head . " Look here , " said Mrs. Stephens , smoking . There was nothing to be seen now but the lights on land and the lights of the buoys moving , and they might have been anywhere , sitting together in darkness , except for the lapping of the cold tongues of sea . " What are you going to do about your girl ? " asked Mrs. Stephens . " Are n't you going to put up a fight for her ? " " What 's over 's through with , like I said , " said Bridk 's troubled . voice . " They say she went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where she went . I 'm not one to cry over spilt milk , " he said with a short laugh . " Not me . " " No , but if you love someone you go after them tooth and nail , " said Mrs. Stephens . " That 's why I came down here to the coast , " she said , and lap , lap , went the cold tongues of the sea , lap , lap at the fishing-boat 's side . " Look here , you 're going to go after that girl of yours , Bridie , " said Mrs. Stephens . " You 're going to get her and bring her hack to her people . And you 're going to marry her . You 're crazy to ever think you were n't . " " What about the other bloke ? " said Bridie . " Maybe they 're married now . " " Maybe they 're not , " said Mrs. Stephens . She sat smoking her cigarette , hervoice tight and hard beside him . " I 'll give you whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " I have n't the money to leave the country and go after her , " said Bridie , shifting . " I 'll give you the money , " said Mrs. Stephens . " I 'll give it to you forever . And why , do you want to know why ? " she said . He had put his arm around her again and his salty hand was cold as a sea-thing 's in her coat 's dark fur . " Because I believe in love , " she said . " I believe in it . That 's all . " The men were at the nets again , but Bridie did not move from where he was . Her head came almost to his shoulder , unseen , but the hair brushed . softly against his chin and there was the odor of flowers in it . " Look here , " she said in her brief , quick voice . " Do n't let them tell you anything else . Nothing matters but love . I know . I 'm thirty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hold on , lady , " said Bridie , softly , " I 'm twenty-six . " " It does n't matter , " said Mrs. Stephens . " Love matters . You 're going to go after her and bring her back . You 're going to do it . Do I sound hard ? Do I sound tough ? Do I look like a hard-boiled baby ? Well , I am . I 'm so damned tough that I 'd cut anybody 's throat for it ? for love , I mean . I 'd steal , lie , murder for it . And now you know . " " How do you know I 'm going after her ? " asked Bridie , and his heart was shaking with wonder within him . " Because you 're going to listen to me , " said Mrs. Stephens . " I 've got a lot of money , too much money , and I 'd give every cent of it for the one thing worth being poor for . Love is n't something you meet on every street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bridie said . " Then do n't let it go once you 've met it , " said Mrs. Stephens . " Go and tell her , as I 've told you , that nothing matters except holding each other in your arms forever . What good is anything on earth going to do you , Bridie , my love , if you have n't the girl you want to wake up to in the morning and to come home to in the evening , and the kids you want ? " " Shut up , " said Bridie . He jumped to his feet in his grief and stood swaying in the darkness , and she knew he was standing there still because of the skirt of his oilskin coat that moved with the motion of the water , now the touch of it on her knee , and then the touch of it gone , like a hand withdrawing and returning in the dark . " If you 're in love , Bridie , " she said , " for God 's sake go and bring her back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Life she 'll be happy in . It 's for her sake as well as for yours that I 'm saying this to you . You can get off to-morrow on the early train . " " Yes , " said Bridie , scarcely aloud . " Sit down , " said Mrs. Stephens , and Bridie sat down beside her . " I want this so much , " she said in a strong , tight voice to him , " that I 'm ready to go off the end of this boat if anything interferes with it . I want to see you two married , and I 'm not going to stop until it 's true . If you looked at her once again the way you looked at me in the pub to-day , Bridie , she 'd leave any man and follow you back from wherever she is , and she 'd live and die beside you . " " Do you think so ? " asked Bridie , holding her close in his arms . " Do you think that 's true ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling you . She does n't belong to him , they have nothing to do with each other . I know it . She belongs to that town back there and the cliffs , and she ought to be sitting here to-night in your arms the way I 'm sitting , and you ought to be kissing her the way you finished kissing me . " Her hand reached out as if for help , and it dosed with strength on Bridie 's . He was sitting there , smiling in the dark at the thought of what she said . " You ought to reach Glasgow to-morrow evening at the latest , " she said . " You could be in Wick by the following day . From there you can get to the Orkneys in no time . " " The Orkneysl " said Bridle in bewilderment . " What am I going there for ? " " They 're at the Ship Inn at Kirkwall , " said Mrs. Stephens . " Waiting for his divorce to come up . " " How do you know ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephens , and then the voice of Watrus called out from the oilier end , deep and sweet , like a song being sung in the darkness . " Stand by , Bridie , " called Bridie 's father the length of the boat . " The nets is heavy as stone . "
