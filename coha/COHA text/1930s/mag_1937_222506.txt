One of the most prosperous newspapers in the land is the solid old Milwaukee Journal which made money even during Depression . At her death last February , the 55% of Journal stock Founder Lucius William Nieman left in trust to his widow and his niece , Faye McBeath , was to be sold , not necessarily to the highest bidder , but to the persons " most likely to carry on the Journal tradition . " <P> Mrs. Nieman 's own will directed that proceeds of her estate be given to Harvard as a memorial for a favorite nephew The paper 's President &; Editor Harry Johnston Grant , who already owned 20% of the Journal , thereupon announced that he and Niece McBeath wanted to have the Nieman stock made available for a plan whereby the Journal 's employes could buy in on the ownership ( TIME , June 15 ) <P> This week , with the court 's blessing because he is credited with the Journal 's present prosperity , President Grant was ready to reveal his plan . It proved to be as comprehensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. has ever seen . <P> The 1,100 shares in the Nieman estate were acquired by the Journal Co. and Miss McBeath at $3,500 a share , Miss McBeath buying in her part of the trustfund . Next , one-fourth of the Journal 's total stock , split 100 for 1 to convenient $35 units , was offered for sale to Journal employes of five years standing . Since 531 Journalists qualified , each employe received an initial stock quota of from $500 to $5,000 , based on his pay &; rank . <P> Many a Journal man found last January 's large bonus a help toward the 50% down payment on his stock . Balance was due within ten years , with dividends applied toward payment . Employes leaving the Journal , or reaching the age of 65 must return their holdings in the stock for resale to eligible employes . Through the trustees , they may sell at any time to other employes . To prevent sales to outsiders , employes hold " certificates of participation " with voting power , instead of actual stock . <P> With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate of a former Journal business manager and the employes will each own one-fourth of the paper . Mr. Grant and Miss McBeath have directed in their wills that their stock will eventually be sold to employes thus giving them full control .
