On December 22 last , the Dowager Duchess of Rutland , a portrait painter famed in Victoria 's day as a beauty , breathed her last in the London house of her son . His Grace the Duke of Rutland shut up her corpse in his town house and , telling no one , traveled to Belvoir ( pronounced Beaver ) Castle , his home in Lincolnshire , to entertain family and friends over Christmas . Not until last week did Britons learn that , ignoring customary burial practices , the Duke had thus kept his mother 's death a secret for six days . The Duke hastily explained that he had acted in accordance with his mother 's deathbed wish-that her death must not spoil the family Christmas party .
