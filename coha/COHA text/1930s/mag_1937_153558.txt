Despite the dogged conviction of the late , high-domed Publicist Arthur Brisbane that high-domed foreheads are a mark of superior intelligence , a mass of evidence has been assembled by scientists to show that , so far as living members of the species Homo sapiens are concerned , no connection can be traced between intellectual ability and the size or shape of the skull . Eskimos have bigger heads than civilized whites but no one argues that they are any smarter . Nevertheless it is a fact that the skull size of man in general has increased with progress up the evolutionary scale , and anthropologists are greatly interested in the normal range of variation in cranial capacity. * Present average is 1,450 cubic centimetres ; but a person may have an interior head size several hundred cc. above or below that figure and still not be abnormal . <P> The Smithsonian Institution 's tireless Ales Hrdlicka recently caused an anthropological stir by discovering in the Aleutian Islands the skull of an Aleut which had a capacity of 2,005 cc . ( TIME , Oct. 12 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the largest anywhere except for one huge , famed Russian head : that of Novelist Ivan Turgenev which was measured at 2,030 cc . Last week a fragmentary skull found in Virginia and assembled at the Smithsonian outstripped even Turgenev 's by an amazing margin , took indisputable first rank as the biggest head ever to pass under the scrutiny of science . <P> Finder was Judge William Johnson Graham of the U. S. Court of Customs &; Patent Appeals , an experienced amateur archeologist who was probing the remains of the old Algonquin village of Patowoameke , from which the Potomac derives its name . When the skull fragments of the old Indian ; perhaps a contemporary of John Smith and Pocahontas , were fitted together . Judge Graham gasped in astonishment : " Why , it 's as big as a watermelon ! " This was only mild hyperbole . The unknown Algonquin 's cranial capacity was measured at 2,200 cc . <P> <P> *Skulls deformed by giantism , hydrocephaly , microcephaly , etc. are of course not in the normal range .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
