For 15 years the Methodist Episcopal Church has admitted women to its ministry , giving them the right to preach , wed , baptize , but rarely assigning them as pastors to churches . There is an Association of Methodist Women Preachers . Last week in Chicago the Methodist female ministry received its youngest and best looking member thus far . With the approval of the Rock River Conference which was impressed with her evangelistic work , Bishop Ernest Lynn Waldorf ordained 23-year-old Uldine Utley , who carried a white-bound Bible and a red rose , wore a gold-collared blue gown . <P> A dozen years ago Uldine Utley was a Baptist who rose to fame as a protegee of Manhattan 's late Dr. John Roach Straton . Six years ago she turned Methodist . Not above displaying her attractions in a bathing suit ( see cut ) , she has since been called by irreverent newshawks " the Garbo of the Pulpit . " Heretofore a licensed Methodist preacher , she is now a deaconess with full right to the title Reverend .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
