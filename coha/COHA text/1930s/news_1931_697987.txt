txt Sales and earnings of the leading department stores have been holding up fairly well this year in view of prevailing business conditions . In most instants more articles of merchandise have been sold than in the first half of 1930 , although dollar volume necessarily is less , due to lower selling prices . After a poor May . business In June snowed an encouraging gain due apparently to better weather and to the improved tone of the stock market . Sales in May showed a severe decline all over the country particularly in spring ready-to-wear apparel which in some New York stores showed a drop of 25% to 30% . This was due mainly to the weather , altbc ugh it is probable that country-wide bank failures and disturbing financial news also had its effect . Since the large department stores normally earn 75% of their year 's profits in the last quarter , and in abnormal years even a larger proportion , no estimates of annual earnings made at this time are of any particular value . However , comparisons with the results of last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probable trend Obviously a. pronounced business recovery in the fall would have a very important effect upon the year 's profits of the big stores . Macy Volume Ahead Sales volume of R. H. Macy &; Co. so far this year has been well in excess of the corresponding period a year ago , due partly to the opening of the large new addition fronting on 7th Avenue . New York , and partly to intensive sales campaigns . alacy 's showing this year will probably also be improved by the better results of the L. Bamberger store in Newark , N. J. , which last year showed a net profit of only 3256,034 , or less than its preferred dividend requirements of 3619,320 annually . In the 1929 fiscal year Bamberger earned 31.502,821 before preferred dividends . but last year it was a drain on the profits of the parent company . It is probable that Bamberger at least will cover preferred dividend requirements this year . Macy 's consolidated net last year . including Bamberger 's was $7,130,303 , equal to $4.81 a share on 1,354 , - 931 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased sales in the ne-ve billidiar which adds nearly 50% to available selling space will be the initial expense of equipping- the large new building . Some years ago when Macy opened its first 19-story addition , profits showed a temporary decline , and since general conditions now are more unfavorable than at that time , it is likely that profits this year will be decreased by the extra expense and will not reflect the full benefit of the increased space . Federated Doing Better Federated , Department Stores also is making a relatively good showing . Abraham &; Straus , its Brooklyn unit , is running ahead of last year due mainly to completion of additional selling space . Bloomingdale 's also is profiting by new store facilities and aggressive management , and is showing larger sales than last year . The two other stores in the chain . Filene 's in Boston and Lazarus , are running about even with a year ago . Federated for the year ended January 31 , last , reported net profit of $2,098,959 , or $2.34 a share on 898,388 shares of capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 had sales volume only slightly lower than in the corresponding 1930 period , but business in May showed a considerable decline due mainly to unfavorable weather . June business was much better . A substantial reduction has been made in operating expenses of all stores without any reduction in salaries or wages . The company now is operating with inventories at the lowest point in 12 years having effected a reduction of about 17% in stocks on band last year . A number of important improvements were made in facilities and personnel of the various stores last year which also should be helpful . Net profit for the year ended January 31 last was $2,487,458 , equal to $2.01 a share on 588,940 shares of common . May Department Store Business Off May Department Stores sales volume has been running below that of a year ago although the business of the various stores has been better than the average business in other stores located in the same towns . May operates in a number of industrial towns including Akron , Cleveland and Pittsburgh which have been particularly hard hit by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . May Department Stores reported net of $4,080,953 for its year ended January 31 , 1931 , equal to $3.03 a share on 1,345,244 shares of common . Gimbel Brothers so far is showing profits about as large as a year ago . The New York and Philadelphia Gimbel stores have been doing relatively well ; business in the Pittsburgh store has been fair and Saks-Fifth Avenue also has been holding up well . Gimbel Bros. ' net for year ended January 31. last , was $379,844 or $2.19 a share on 173,000 preferred shares . All department store executives are concentrating on keeping expenses and inventories at a minimum , and very large . savings have been made in operating overhead which will go far to make up for the decreased dollar voluine this year . Inventories probably are lower in proportion to sales than ever before in the retail business . Thus there is less likelihood of large inventory losses this year than a year ago . However , under present difficult operating conditions some substantial inventory adjustments Rrobably , will be inevitable .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
