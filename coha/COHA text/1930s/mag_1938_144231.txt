One evening three weeks ago , guests arrived at a " charter day dinner " held in the gymnasium of Washington 's Howard University , largest Negro university in the U. S. As they arrived they were handed copies of the Alumni Journal , published by the university 's General Alumni Association . Three hundred copies were distributed before police routed the distributors . On the Journal 's cover was a large portrait of bald , pince-nezzed , light-skinned Dr. Mordecai Wyatt Johnson , first Negro president of the 71-year-old institution , now serving his twelfth year , and beneath it in large letters : " The Case Against President Mordecai W. Johnson . " <P> Inside the Journal , readers found sensational matter . The gist of three main charges : <P> The case oj Lucy D. Slowe : While Miss Slowe , dean of women for 15 years , lay on her deathbed , President Johnson sent a message announcing his intention to appoint her successor within 24 hours . <P> The case of the misused PWA money : Because of irregularities in the expenditure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return $32,000 to the U. S. Government . Particularly pointed were alumni references to the mystery of the " missing " lumber , $545 worth of PWA wood which President Johnson was accused of having spirited away at dead of night . <P> The case of the seduced wife : For refusing to withdraw charges that a Howard University professor had seduced his young wife , a laboratory assistant , Robert Thompson , was fired . <P> Last week , while the university 's trustees investigated the charges , President Johnson sniffed . He declared that the General Alumni Association includes only 253 of the 8,000 living Howard alumni , that it employs tactics " almost equivalent to gangsterism . " His answer to the charges : 1 ) He had asked Dean Slowe to suggest an acting dean , sent her a note hoping she would soon be back ; 2 ) Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes had found " no implication of dishonesty " in the handling of PWA money or PWA lumber ; 3 ) Laboratory Assistant Thompson had failed to produce evidence of a seduction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Harvard and University of Chicago . He has raised $5,000,000 for expansion of Howard , which today has 2,108 men and women students in nine graduate and undergraduate branches , gets most of its money for operating expenses from the U. S. Government . Abuse from disgruntled alumni has been the hairshirt of Howard University presidents , even of its first president , O. O. Howard , who was investigated by a Congressional committee and exonerated . All of it is due , President Johnson insists , to the hope of Negro intellectuals close to the Government that they may get jobs if there is a shakeup in the university .
