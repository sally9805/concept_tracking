Economic warfare must be regarded as a vital offensive arm complementary to the operations of the three fighting services , and the activities of the Ministry will be of the widest scope . <P> So read an opening communiqu from Britain 's new Ministry of Economic Warfare , which last week set quietly about its business of strangling Germany internally while warriors blasted it from without . <P> In World War I , the similar Ministry of Blockade did not really get the screws on before 1917 . When it did , the results were accounted the greatest single factor leading to Germany 's final collapse . The Blockaders under Lord Robert ( later League-loving Viscount ) Cecil gradually pushed neutrals into yielding belligerent Britain 's right to have the Royal Navy arrest neutral shipping on the high seas , and " examine " its cargoes . <P> Last week the new Ministry of Economic Warfare cleared its way by announcing that Germany 's unrestricted submarine warfare entitled Britain to retaliate , and by solemnly adding that " no blockade of Germany in the formal sense of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple strangulation : thoroughgoing , but informal . The idea was , not only to prevent anything helpful from reaching Germany direct , but to " ration " Germany 's neutral neighbors so as to make sure no helpful surpluses would spill over their borders into Hitlerland . <P> Appointed to perform this job was Ronald Hibbert Cross , M. P. , 43 , an Old Etonian with a War record in the Lancaster Yeomanry and Royal Flying Corps and a public career closely parallel to that of President Viscount ( " Czecho-Slovakia " ) Runciman of the Board of Trade , for which Mr. Cross has been Parliamentary Secretary . By trade a merchant-banker , six-foot Ronald Cross has before now earned personal preferment as high as Vice-Chamberlain of His Majesty 's Household in 1937 . As lord-master of neutral shipping , he will now be a key war figure , with Viscount Cecil 's record to shoot at . <P> Cooperating with Mr. Cross in France will be Paul Morand , one of those literary public servants upon whom public life in Europe so often devolves . Morand 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Daladier ; he attended Oxford University and the Paris School of Political Science . He has served in France 's London , Rome and Madrid embassies but never dabbled in the world trade which he will now help govern . <P> First act of Britain 's ministry was to have King George sign a contraband list , which was not made public before the U. S. State Department had looked it over . Under " absolute " contraband were " all kinds of arms , ammunition , explosives , etc. , " and articles for using or making them ; " fuel of all kinds " and all " contrivances . . . articles . . . animals . . . ingredients " for using or making ; all means of communication , tools , instruments , maps , machines ; all " coin , bullion , currency , evidences of debt . " Conditional contraband ( i.e. , to be sidetracked or commandeered by the British if they choose ) were " all kinds of foods , foodstuffs , feed , forage and clothing .
