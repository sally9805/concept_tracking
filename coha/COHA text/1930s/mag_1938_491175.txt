JOHN WILKES BOOTH  --  or " John , " as he is generally called in outdoor amusement circles  --  had his first prosperous season last year since 1804 . He earned $20,000 in the year before he killed Lincoln . How much he made last year is a trade secret , but it ran well into four figures . Historians have raised quibbles as to whether John is the authentic John Wilkes Booth : at any rate , he is the authentic John Wilkes Booth of the street fairs and midways . John is not a member of Equity or the Actors ' Guild because of the technicality that he is no longer living . He is America 's leading mummy . Historians of the old school allege that John Wilkes Booth was killed in Garrett 's burn in Virginia on April 26 , 1865 , twelve days after be assassinated Lincoln . Partisans of John have another version . They say that Booth escaped From Garrett 's barn and lived in Texas and Oklahoma under the names of Ney , St. Helen , Ryan and George  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Booth committed suicide by arsenic at Enid , Oklahoma , on January 13 , 1903 . Forty pounds of affidavits say that this man was the genuine John Wilkes Booth . At any rate , John , in a magnificent state of preservation , has had an interesting professional life since 1903 . The postmortem career of this . John Wilkes Booth , whether he belongs to history or as Tutankhamen is supposed to have done . Nearly every showman who exhibited John has been ruined . Eight people were killed in 1920 in the wreck of a circus train on which John was traveling . Bill Evans , the wealthy Carnival King of the Southwest , who exhibited the mummy for years , was ruined financially ; he died in 1933 , shot in a Chicago holdup . Finis L. Bates , a Memphis lawyer and original sponsor of John , died in 1923 after suffering much ridicule because of a book he wrote on John . The Rev , Dr. Clarence True Wilson , one of the great leaders of the prohibition movement , was an enthusiastic champion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except that his heart was nearly broken by repeal . John has had a strange knockabout existence . He has been bought and sold , leased , held under bond , kidnaped and seized for debt ; has been repeatedly chased out of town by local authorities for not having a license or for violating other ordinances ; has been threatened with hanging by indignant G. A. R. veterans . Up until 1937 he has been a consistent money loser . John 's present owner is John Harkin. of Wheat-field , Indiana , formerly the chief tattooed man of the Wallace-Hagenheek circus . Harkin made a fortune in the circus and carnival business , invested it in Chicago residential property and retired . But six years ago he saw the mummy , was fascinated by it and bought it for 85000 . John appealed strongly to Harkin because Harkin is a rugged individualist in his interpretation of history ; he holds , for example , that Napoleon escaped after the Battle of Waterloo and that a dummy made up to resemble him was sent to St. Helena . The Villain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set out in n battered exhibition truck which can be converted into a small amusement palace . They traveled economically . At night they slept on bunks on either side of the truck ; John , who was considered practically a member of the family , had a berth on the floor between them . Now and then they had streaks of luck . They struck it richest at Shawano , Wisconsin , which is near the Menominee Indian Reservation . The Indians came in droves . Mr. Harkin made inquiries and learned that , several years before , a white schoolteacher on the reservation had stated that the assassin of Lincoln was an Indian . The chief of the Menominee was so happy to discover that John was a Caucasian that he ordered the entire tribe to attend the show . But Shawano was a great exception . In Springfield , Missouri , for example , John played an entire week to twenty-five cents . In the meantime everything went wrong with Harkin 's Chicago property . Negroes moved into the block and Harkin 's tenants moved out . John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not been paid . Harkin sold his real estate for $300 above the mortgage in order to raise money to recover the mummy . If , as Charles Evans Hughes has said , truth is to he found even in affidavits , John must be what he purports to be . When the exhibition truck is packed for traveling , there is hardly room for the three occupants , so much space is taken up by affidavits . Harkin complains that he is up to his neck in sworn statements all the time . These documents have even silenced college profemors , who inclined to the reactionary view that John Wilkes Booth was killed in 1865 . Anyway , these affidavits have convinced Harkin . During all exhibitions he flaunts a banner which reads , $1000 REWARD TO ANYONE WHO CAN PROVE THAT THIS is NOT JOHN ' WILKES BOOTH . That reward , according to the showman , has never even been claimed .

Always on the lookout for a good cultural attraction , Jay Gould annexed the John Wilkes Booth outfit last : mar . He made it pay . He is the first showman who had the genius to operate a modern American mummy successfully . After the million-dollar performance is completed , Gould steps to the loud-speaker , delivers a lecture on John , and crowds swarm to see him . Before Gould took general supervision over the attraction , its worst . enemies were skeptics who would look at John and jeeringly exclaim " Wax ! " Mr. and Mrs. Harkin tremble with indignation at the mere mention of wax . Their $5000 historical and educational item has for years been up against the unfair competition of wax outlaws and heroes . Jay Gould who come to show off their learning at the mummy 's expense are the show 's best advertisements . John thrives on controversy of this nature . A hot argument about his historical authenticity always brings in a good house . " There 's nobody , " said Harkin , " that we welcome so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason for the mummy 's big season in 1937 was the volume of newspaper controversy over the assassination of Lincoln . The subject was opened upon a large scale by Otto Eisenschiml 's book , Why Was - Lineeln Murdered ? This author produced a vast amount of material suggesting that Secretary of War Stanton was the ringleader of a plot to kill Lincoln and that Stanton arranged to facilitate the escape of Booth . The Eimensehiml volume makes it appear plausible that Booth might have lived for many years la I er 1805 . Another historical volume published So confident is the showman of the justice or his cause that , even when fiat broke , he has continued to hurl his $1000 challenge at the public . He has been reduced to trading the colored electric bulbs which illuminate John at night shows for gasoline to get to the next town ; but even in this extremity , he has maintained the $1000 challenge . He has been so impoverished that. , in order to eat , he has been forced to go to the hospitable Rio Grande Valley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . for nothing ; even in this emergency he has continued to throw down his $1000 gage to the scholarship of America . The spell of adversity which pursued John for many years was reversed last season , when the Harkins became connected with the Jay Gould Million-Dollar Show which toured Minnesota and South Dakota , solved this problem immediately . His first move on hitting a new town is to summon the undertakers , admit them free of charge and send them away loving . liven after decades of rough carnival and sideshow life , John is a masterpiece compared to the Pharaohs in the museums . He is as tough and leathery as a. tackling dummy . One reason for this is that the Enid undertaker used arsenic in embalming the body . This is said to be the best preservative , but ill recent years its use has generally been forbidden , because it may be employed to destroy the evidence in eases where murder has been perpetrated by arsenic . The fact that the suicide was by arsenic is said to have been an additional factor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was a business killer , other criticisms of John have been helpful . Educatorslast year which may promote John 's future career is This One Mad /let , by Isola Forrester , a granddaughter of John Wilkes Booth , who presents evidence that members of her family were in personal contact with the assassin for a generation after 1865 . Isola Forrester . however , is not impressed with the theory that the late St. Helen-Ney-Ryan-George , now known as John , was her grandfather . Finis L. Bates , of Memphis , did more than anybody else to snake John famous , but he also did more than anybody else to discredit him . Bates was twenty-one-year-cild lawyer in Cranbury , in 1872 . He represented his fellow townsman , John St. Helen , in an excise ease . The two men became close friends . John St. Helen fell ill . On what he apparently thought WaS his deathbed , St. Helen called Bates and ( Continued an Pape 34 ) ( Cortlinaiod from Page 32 ) the warden down with the first blow , and while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the face and head with his heavy shoes , breaking his nose and severely injuring him otherwise . I was about . eighteen feet from Phillips when this attack tools place , and I was too shocked to move . If this was the signal for a general uprising , it missed fire . For . in less time than it takes to tell it , the guards were upon Phillips , beating him with blackjacks . They did a thorough job of it , and Phillips and the warden both were then lying unconscious on the floor . The prisoners milled about . in confusion and uproar and , at that instant , the outside guard broke out the window glass and stuck his machine gum into the room . The prisoners , screaming , broke out of line and scurried to cover under tables and chairs . " For God 's sake , do n't shoot ! You 'll kill us all ! " screamed one of the inside guards in the dining room . Had the guard outside begun shooting , this story , had I lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloodshed . The convicts were then marched quietly off to their cells , pale and shaken at their narrow escape front death , and the warden and Phillips were taken to the hospital , where Phillips , who by that time was raving , was placed in a strait jacket . Phillips was undoubtedly emotionally insane or , as convicts say , " stir crazy . " He had been sentenced for life for kidnaping . In robbing a bank he had carried off a bank employee as a shield . He was eonvicted under the so-called Dillinger law , which makes kidnaping a Federal statutory offense . What made Phillips brood until he finally broke was his belief that the writs which he had prepared in his cell to present to a court , never got past the warden 's office . He was still in isolation when I left in November , and the prisoners were whispering that the authorities had confessed himself to be John Wilkes Booth . Bates says he saved St .. Helen 's , or Booth 's , life on that occasion by rubbing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " St. Helen made other deathbed confessions and survived them , but in 1903 he ratified his final deathbed confession by actually dying . There is documentary evidence of the honesty of Bates in this matter . He wrote a letter to the War Department to see if he could get a reward by delivering John Wilkes Booth alive . Rewards totaling 8100,000 had been offered by the War Department in 1865 , but they had been collected by the men who trapped the alleged Booth in the Garrett barn in Virginia . The War Department wrote to Bates that it look " no interest " in the matter . Years after he had sought to deliver Booth on the hoof , Bates identified the suicide at Enid as the self-confessed assassin of Lincoln . An undertaker at Enid embalmed the body on the expectation that the Booth family or the War Department would claim it . It remained unclaimed for years ; Bates finally procured it . This transfer was sanctioned by an Oklahoma judge , apparently on the theory that the Memphis lawyer would accord decent burial to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to commercialize his even refused his father permission to see him . Solitary confinement preyed on the minds of three men on Sunday , and they were released when they agreed to go back to work . Eight more broke down on Monday and were put to work . The leaders exhorted the others to stand firm , but twenty-five men came out on Tuesday and the mutiny received a crushing blow on Wednesday , when sixty men agreed to behave themselves and go back to work . This left forty of the hardiest men in dungeons , and these men howled curses at the guards and screamed reproaches on the convicts who had abandoned the strike . But. , one by one , they began to drop off , driven out by hunger , despair and the terrible stench , Some of them were really sick . Only fifteen men were in solitary by Sunday , and when I left the prison in November , there were yet five stout souls holding out . Knowing something of the horrors of solitary confinement , I do not understand how they stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mutiny was absolutely futile . The plan for the next mutiny at . Alcatraz is diabolically clever . It got its cue from two things which convicts observed  --  the consternation of the officials when it was found the wild shooting of the guards had damaged the mangle in the laundry , and their frantic worriment , when the laundry began to pile up with work it could not do when so many men were on strike . Therefore the men have decided that the vulnerable spot in Alcatraz is the shops , especially those having contract work . If they can tie up the laundry and other shops at Alcatraz , they will paralyze the place . And that is exactly what they plan to do . The mistake of the other strikes was in refusing to work and remaining in their cells ; this year the mutineers . if they follow plans which they had formed before I left in November , will begin the mutiny by wrecking the machinery in the shops .

This book is the greatest obstacle which the present champions of John have to contend with . Published in 1908 , it purports to relate conversations between Bates and St. Helen-Booth in 1872 . During the years intervening , Bates had steeped himself in the literature relating to the assassination . He got his historical reading badly mixed up with his conversations with St. Helen . Although probably made in good faith , many of the statements of Bates were easily proved to be false . Even if Bates had established his ease to a mathematical certainty . his flowery and ridiculous style would have made skeptics of his readers . Bates hired the body out to showmen from time to time . At the Waco Cotton Palace about eighteen years ago , it attracted the attention of William Evans , the Carnival King of the Southwest , who started John on his big-time career , Evans hired the attraction at the rate of 81000 for every twenty weeks , the $1000 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bond as a guaranty that John would be returned in good repair . The officials will , have no warning of this , because the men plan to report . for work as usual and then begin sabotage . They think they can gain concessions by this , and they figure they have nothing to lose . What , for instance , has a man got to look forward to who has three or more life sentences hanging over him ? Most of them felt as I did ; had I known , twelve years ago , what I know now about prisons , I 'd have insisted on the death sentence instead of eighteen years , Asthe time for my releaseap-proached in November , I became increasingly alarmed over the possibility that I had lost my time off for good behavior , although I did n't see how this was possible . On November fourth I had served an even twelve years  --  almost one third of my life . I felt I had paid my debt . On the afternoon of November fourth I was summoned to the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was given the small sum of money which I had brought with me from Atlanta , as I had not spent a penny at Alcatraz . Prisoners , if they have no money , are given ten dollars expense money , plus five dollars per day for each day of travel back to their homes , as well as a railroad ticket . Prisoners are usually released by way of Oakland , but I was taken to San Francisco . Maybe it had some connection with the fact that I was released under the old law and the Government could not close my mouth if I wanted to talk ; I was not released conditionally , as so many Federal prisoners are . When I left the prison at six o'clock , I was hurried to the train by the warden 's secretary and the record clerk . They stayed with me every minute until the train began to move . As the train began to move , a prison official leaned over to me and said : " Conway , the quicker you forget the joint the better it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish I could ! Bill Evans had made his start in the entertainment field by marrying one of his own wives twenty times in twenty towns . Public weddings used to be big civic celebrations in the Southwest , and Evans staged his like operas . He differed from some of his competitors in that he always married the same bride , and in later life he used to claim to be the greatest polymonogamist in the United States . Evans would begin by stampeding newspaper offices with the romantic details of his approaching outdoor nuptials . Hammering away at the slogan that " all the world loves a lover , " he convinced local merchants that there was no better way to advertise than to give the happy couple wedding presents . From the sale of the loot of twenty weddings , he obtained a modest stake and soon had his own tent . In time he became known as the Carnival King of the Southwest and the possessor of the greatest freak-animal show in the country . Evans had intended to use John as the headliner of his carnival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start . John never paid expenses . Iii his days on the legitimate stage , John Wilkes Booth had been a great actor , Some of his contemporaries thought him greater than his ( Continued on Pogo 36 ) ( Continued from Page 34 ) father , Junius Brutus Booth , or his brother , Edwin Booth . John Wilkes Booth was , however , an almost perfect ham . Vanity was his ruling motive . His assassination of Lincoln was an act of pure vanity . Booth had gone through the Civil War without fighting ; he could not bear to have the war heroes towering over him ; he killed Lincoln in the hope of stealing the show from the fighting men . The poor ham broke into history , but it might have given him pause , back in 1865 , if he could have looked forward to 1920 and could have seen what was left of him competing unsuccessfully with bulldog-faced cows and six-legged sheep . Evans did not blame John for his poor showing . He chiefly blamed the American public-school system for its failure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious-mindedness of carnival lovers . He decided that it was necessary to detach John from the midway attractions and send him on a - sparate tour under more dignified auspices . Before he could work out his plan , however , the Evans carnival train was wrecked en route to San Diego . John escaped intact , so the $40,000 bond was saved ; but eight employees and most of the freak animals were killed . When the Carnival King was seeking to reorganize his show , John was kidnaped . This was a serious matter : not only was the mummy costing Evans a rental of $1000 every twenty weeks but its continued disappearance would mean the forfeiture of the $40 , - 000 bond . Week after week Evans ran an advertisement in The Billboard , the Bible of the circus and carnival world , offering a reward of $1000 for information leading to the recovery of John . One day he met the alleged kidnaper on the street in San Diego . They had a knock-down-and-drag-out fight , ending in jail . The controversy ended in a stalemate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it would be impossible to establish title . The law is somewhat whimsical on the subject .

His problem was solved one day , however , when the kidnaper of John came in and said : " I claim the reward . Pay me the $1000 and I 'll return him in good condition . " It was agreed that Evans should pay $500 ransom money in advance and $500 after the body had been restored . The Carnival King paid the first $500 in cash and the second $500 in a rubber check . His next step was to return the mummy to Finis L. Bates , of Memphis , and cancel the $40,000 bond . Bates died . His widow was disappointed in her first efforts to market the Booth chattel , but she finally sold it to the misguided Carnival King for $1000 . It brought Evans nothing but had luck . He suffered setback after setback in the carnival business , until he finally quit and retired to a small potato farm at Declo , Idaho . He took John with him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung out a sign in front of his farmhouse , reading , SEE THE MAN WHO MURDERED LINCOLN . An Echo of the Civil War The mummy might have still been there , casting a mild blight over the potato patch , except for the fact that an automobile drove into Declo one day in 1928 containing J. N. Wilkerson , a Kansas City lawyer and one of the leading authorities on Booth . In the early 20 's Mr. Wilkerson had picked up a set of books called Modern Eloquence for $1.50 at a secondhand bookstore . Turning its pages one day he had read the oration of Special Judge-Advocate John A. Bingham against Booth 's alleged co-conspirators in the assassination of Lincoln . Among other things , Bingham had charged that Jeff Davis had offered a reward of $100,000 for the assassination of Lincoln . Wilkerson , who had been born in Alabama , believed this to be false . Ile first read the transcript of the trial and then began to dig into the history of the period . He traced the movements of Booth in Canada , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention had been to kidnap Lincoln and hold him as a hostage to compel the North to exchange prisoners with the South ; Grant having , in the later days of the war , put a stop to the practice of exchanging . The kidnaping plot fell through . Wilkerson collected evidence which convinced him that the actual assassination was a Northern rather than a Southern plot ; that Stanton , Vice-President Johnson and other extreme haters of the Confederacy wanted to put Lincoln out of the way because they were disturbed over his plans for lenient treatment of the South . These Northern statesmen , as Wilkerson interpreted his evidence , set the stage for Booth 's crime and made arrangements for Booth 's escape . Wilkerson became convinced that another man had been killed and buried in his stead . The investigator had gone deep into this before lie heard that an alleged mummy of Booth had been barnstorming the country . Wilkerson wrote at once to Finis L. Bates , the original sponsor for the mummy , but Bates in the meantime had died . The Kansas City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he happened to be motoring through Declo , his attention was attracted by the sign , SEE THE MAN WHO MURDERED LINCOLN . Wilkerson looked up the broken Carnival King in his potato patch and asked several questions that the King could not answer . " To tell the truth , " said the King , " I do n't know whether it is the body of Booth or not . They told me it was and I believed them . " If it is Booth , " said Wilkerson , " there ought to be a cut on the right // eyebrow . When he was playing Richard in Richard III , another actor slashed him over the right eye with the sword in the duel scene , " The two men examined John and satisfied themselves that the scar was in its right place . " Booth 's right thumb was broken when a curtain fell on it , " continued Wilkerson . " It was a deformity that made him very sensitive and lie always tried to conceal it . Lot 's take a look . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the mummy had Booth 's deformed thumb . " Now this ought to clinch it one way or another , " said Wilkerson . " Booth had a scar on the back of his neck . It has been described by Doe-tor May , of Washington , who removed a. wen from his neck . The wound was healing nicely when , in a love scene , the Famous actress Charlotte Cushman seized him in such a violent embrace that the stitches were broken . An ugly scar resulted . " The two men turned John over . They found what they considered to be the scar . This nearly convinced Wilkerson , be t he still wanted to know more . He suggested a tour through all the towns in the Southwest where John Wilkes Booth was supposed to have ranged wider various aliases from about 1870 until his suicide in 1903 . Wilkerson offered to break off his own trip and go along as barker for John , The Carnival King figured that , with a real historian to gather affidavits backing up the mummy , John might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but fintweiolly unprofitable . Here and there John was a draw , but usually he lacked magnetism . After leaving Deelo , the first stop was Salt Lake City . The historian and the Carnival King took in 5200 , but were then ordered to leave town . " There has been a complaint against you , " said the policeman . " The principal of the high school charges that you are teaching false history . " Business was good at Big Spring , Texas , until the local authorities seized them . They were tried by the justice of the peace in the back room of his bakery and fined fifty dollars for transporting a corpse without a license . In order to avert trouble of this kind , they went , to the state capitol at Austin and showed their traveling companion to the chief health officer of the state . " This is not a corpse but a mummy , " said the health official . " If you get into any more trouble of this kind , refer the local people to me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the precaution of incorporating . He obtained , for a fee of ten dollars , a charter for the American Historical Research Society . This is an imposing document with the Lone Star seal on it , and it has saved the operators of the mummy from trouble on innumerable oee'asions . John now travels in a truck with THE AMERICAN HISTORICAL RESEARCH SOCIETY painted on the front of it . The attraction is advertised by handbills , the first words of which are : THE AMERICAN HISTORICAL RESEARCH SOCIETY PRESIDNTS ? JOHN WILKES BOOTH For a while Wilkerson and his partner operated successfully at Odessa , Texas , where there had just been an oil strike . Everybody wanted to spend ' money , and they threw silver dollars into the collection plate . John was hitting upwards of twenty-five dollars an hour when a woman spectator said to Wilkerson : " If you want to know about Booth 's life after the assassination , you ought to go and see Judge G. M. Schenck , of Lubbock . He knows all about it . " In spite of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and started on the long trip to Lubbock , Texas , where he found Circuit Judge Schenck . The judge told of meeting a stranger at breakfast in Guthrie , Oklahoma , in 1901 . They got into conversation and the judge stated that he hailed from Meridian , Texas , " Why , that 's John Wilkes Booth 's old hiding place , " said the stranger , who then started to tell of the ramblings of Booth after the assassination . The judge was held spellbound and spent most of the day and night with his new friend , who was full of sensational details of Booth 's escape in 1865 and his meanderings in the Southwest From the description of the man , Mr. Wilkerson concluded that the judge was hearing the tale from the lips of Booth himself . The story cleared up many points that had puzzled Wilkerson , but particularly the matter of certain tattoo marks missing on John . Before the assassination , Wilkes had the initials " J. W. B. " tattooed on his right hand . They are not . found on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that Booth had had the initials removed by a friendly tattoo remover in New Orleans . A ' Texas Tradition Wilkerson made almost a house-tohouse canvass in Glen Rose , Iredell , Cranbury and other towns in Texas where the alleged Booth had been known as John St. Helen . From scores of people Wilkerson obtained descriptions of St. Helen which seemed to fit Booth . Everybody was particularly emphatic about St. Helen 's elegance of dress and courtliness of manners . St. Helen ran two saloons at Granburythe Blackhawk and the Lady Gay . Wilkerson found old patrons who testified that drinking men went to those saloons as to a school of etiquette and learned the ways of high society merely by observing St. Helen . One of Wilkerson 's witnesses was Ashley W. Crockett , a grandson of Davy Crockett . Ashley , a Texas journalist for more than half a century , was a cub reporter of the Granbury Vidette in the early 70 's . He recalled how St. Helen came into the Vidette office one day with a tray covered with choice liquors , bowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat for the office force , " then withdrew elegantly before anybody could thank him . Many old-timers recalled John St. Helen as the man who introduced backgammon into that part of the world . Wilkerson has found nothing in the literature to show that John Wilkes Booth played backgammon in this country before 1865 . His conjecture is that the assassin picked it up in England , where he is believed to have spent some years between 1805 and 1870 . At Granbury , Wilkerson found Mrs. Eula Carter , who said that her late husband knew St. Helen to be Booth . St. Helen 's earliest known appearance in Texas was at Iredell , in Basque County , where he taught school . At that time he boarded with a man named Green Williams . Wilkerson here found , to his dismay , that St , Helen had confessed , not that he was Booth but that he was a son of Marshal Ney , who , according to some authorities , escaped after Waterloo and Fettled in the United States . St. Helen went so far as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself St. Helen after the island of St. Helen and did this as a tribute to Napoleon  --  the least that a son of Marshal Ney could do to honor his old commander . This complicated matters and puzzled Wilkerson for some time . His conclusion , however , was that the stranger obviously had a past , and told the Ney story in order to parry the suspicion that he might be Booth . Another awkward episode occurred in Texas . The technique of operating the mummy was a delicate one . If au admission charge was made , it was necessary to take out a local theatrical license . The license fee was prohibitive , in view of John 's low average earning power . Therefore , admissiou was free . But , as the spectator filed out of the exhibition truck , gentle pressure was put on him to contribute something toward paying the expense of the culture-spreading institution . A plate was conspicuously exhibited with a few quarters and half dollars in it . Dimes , nickels or pennies that got into the plate were deftly removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an admirable rule to the effect that the contributions of children should be graciously returned . But Wilkerson was absent for a time while John was playing in Temple , Texas . The Carnival King , who had never approved of the practice of depriving minors of the right to contribute , high-pressured a lot of school children for small change . Local indignation developed , and the entire Ameriean Historical Research Society was run out of town by the police . The Trail of an Assassin During his long search for evidence , Wilkerson uncovered five living . John Wilkes Booths , four of whom were related to the assassin of Lincoln . All had changed their names . By personal interviews and by correspondence , he made contact with many other relatives of Booth . From many of these he obtained accounts of meetings with John Wilkes Booth long after the assassination . Blanche Booth , a niece of John Wilkes Booth , was in El Reno , Oklahoma , with a touring company in December , 1902 . She made an affidavit that a man called at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blanche , would n't you like to see Johnny ? " She slammed the door in his face , regarding him as a stage-door Johnny , but when she looked at the card , she found the name " John Wilkes Booth " in what seemed to he her uncle 's handwriting . Wilkerson 's researches indicate that Booth  --  then using the name David E. George  --  went to Enid immediately thereafter , stayed drunk for three weeks and then committed suicide . The historian conjectures that the rebuff from his niece broke Booth 's heart . During his travels in connection with the Booth saga , Wilkerson stumbled on to some interesting historical material in Beloit , Wisconsin . In April , 1898 , American newspapers had carried reports that John Wilkes Booth had been seen in Brazil . This report stimulated Booth history or myth all over the country . Walter Hubbell , an actor , carried the news to Dr. Joseph Booth , a brother of John Wilkes Booth ; according to Hubbell , Joseph exclaimed , " South America ! Why , the last we heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Brazil report brought two witnesses to light who testified that Booth had made his escape in 1865 . The first of these was Mrs. J. M.

According to her story , she and her husband were on board the Mary Porter in Havana six weeks after the assassination when John Wilkes Booth came aboard and sailed with them to Nassau . She stated that. , because Booth was still suffering from a broken leg , she gave up her cabin to him , and at the end of the voyage he rewarded her by giving her his ring with " J. W. B. " engraved inside . Having kept the secret for thirty-three years , Mrs. Christ now felt entitled to talk . On the following day , Wilson D. Kenzie , of Beloit , gave an interview to the same paper . He said that he had known Booth intimately at New Orleans and had been at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be Booth was killed . Kenzie said that the slain man was a sandy-headed fellow who bore no resemblance to Booth . Wilkerson later found evidence indicating that Booth had intended to go to Nassau if he esca pod . One of Boot h 's accomplices in the kidnaping plot was Sam Arnold . After his release from prison , Arnold wrote a magazine article on the scheme to abduct Lincoln . One of his statements was that delay had resulted because John Wilkes Booth had busied himself with arrangements to ship his stage wardrobe and other effects to Nassau . According to Mrs. Christ , Booth sailed from Nassau on the Wild Pigeon for England . Incidentally , when St. Helen first appeared in Texas in 1870 , he called himself a British subject . Wilkerson ended his travels with John at Aberdeen , Washington . He had gone into the Northwest in search of more Booth relatives . At Aberdeen , according to his custom , he went to the mayor and got permission to place the mummy on exhibition . There was , however , a feud on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ license commissioner had Wilkerson arrested . The historian had to plead eloquently to avoid being locked up . The judge lined him ten dollars and then suspended sentence . But Wilkerson had had enough . He broke up his partnership with Carnival King Evans , who , shortly before he was killed , sold John to the present owners . Wilkerson 's researches have won recognition from Lincoln experts . He delivered a lecture on his investigations before the Lincoln Club in Chicago , and several distinguished Lincolnians were considerably impressed . Dr. Otto L. Schmidt , president of the Illinois State Historical Society and president of the Chicago Historical Society , wrote a modified testimonial in favor of John , saying that the subject was of great interest and well worth further scientific investigation . Tho mummy was exhibited on the campus of Northwestern University at Evanston ; the faculty ordered it off ; Doctor Schmidt , however , interceded for it and the show was allowed to go on . In 1933 John was X-rayed , operated on and otherwise studied by a group of medical men and criminologists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the broken thumb and the scar on the neck were all verified . The operation was performed because it was alleged that the X ray revealed a metal object deep inside of the old trouper . After prolonged drilling into the mummy , which was stated to be as hard as a rock , a bit of metal was produced with an engraving that looked like the letter R. This resulted in the speculation that Booth , in some great emergency , had sought to conceal his identity by swallowing his ring , which had been gradually digested until only a fragment was left . The exploration of John , however , took place under the flashlights of newspaper photographers , and its results failed to gain wide acceptance . Further , one medical man asserted there was no sign of the all-important identifying scar on the neck . There is not much conflict among the authorities on the assassination and on the flight of Booth into Virginia . Booth entered the carelessly guarded box of Lincoln at the Ford Theater a little after ten P.M. on the night of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . The actor then jumped to the stage fourteen feet below . His spur caught on . the American flag draped in front of the box and he fell heavily , breaking his leg . After limping across the stage , shouting " Sic scarper Tyrannis , " he made his way out of the theater to his horse . In spite of the broken leg , he was able , through Southern sympathizers , to baffle his pursuers twelve days , until he was finally located in Garrett 's barn near Bowling Green , Virginia . The barn was surrounded and set on fire . The conflicting theories begin here . Those who believe in the escape tell it two ways : No. 1 is that Booth was warned and made his escape several hours before the barn was surrounded ; No. 2 is that he escaped by an unwatched door after the barn was in flames . Those who believe that Booth was killed in the barn have different versions . One is that he committed suicide ; the other is that he was shot by a Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the killing has generally been assigned to Sergeant Boston Corbett . The orders were to take Booth alive , but Corbett said that God had instructed him to kill the man . The Riddle an Actor Left The Garretts , who had been with Booth shortly before he was killed , identified him immediately after . In fact , one of the Garrett young ladies , who had been smitten with the young actor , was caught in the act of attempting to snip a lock of hair from the dead man 's head . The tattooed initials " J. W. B. " were found , although witnesses disagreed on the location . Doctor May , who had attended Booth , at first said the dead Man bore no resemblance to Booth , but he reversed his opinion on seeing the sear on the neck . In 1869 the body was turned over by the War Department to the Booth family and buried in the Booth plot in the Greenmount Cemetery at Baltimore . The body was identified by members of the family and by a dentist 's report . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denied that the dead man was Booth . The identifiers varied in their descriptions . Izola Forrester , quoting from different witnesses , sets forth that one said the dead man 's hair was gray ; another that it was reddish brown ; another that it was jet black . One of the reasons that Miss Forrester gives for scoffing at the theory that St. Helen  --  now John  --  was Booth is that St. Helen was a commonplace individual . This , however , flies in the face of all the affidavits which picture St. Helen as outrageously elegant and distinguished . The handwriting of St. Helen and of Booth have been compared , with negative results . The experts of one side say there is no resemblance ; the experts of the other side say that there is . John 's schedule for the coming season has not been settled yet . He will probably open up sometime in May . The 51000 challenge still holds good . Incidentally , it is believed to be John 's centenary . At any rate , John Wilkes Booth was born 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
