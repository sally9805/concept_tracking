Last week a stock model Douglas transport plane zipped across the U. S. from Los Angeles to Newark in 12 hr. 3 min . It made but one stop-at Kansas City . Although it failed by nearly two hours to equal the coast-to-coast time of Roscoe Turner 's racing plane , it broke the transport record and clearly showed that a 12-hr , transcontinental passenger service is possible , if not yet practical . <P> Few days later the record-breaking Douglas was scheduled to make a dawn-to-dusk round-trip flight between Newark and Lines ' new Miami to high-speed inaugurate schedules Eastern with Air Douglas equipment . Pioneered by TWA , which put up $140,000 for its development , the Douglas Luxury Airliner is now used by Eastern Air . General Air Lines , American Airlines , Pan American Airways , Royal Dutch Air Lines , Deutsche Lufthansa , Swissair , Spanish Airlines and Austrian Airlines . <P> Considered by many the most important advance in aerial transportation since the Wright biplane , the Douglas DC2 bears the name of a mild-mannered , retiring Californian named Donald Wills Douglas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seems always to have made money building airplanes . A member of the class of 1913 at Annapolis , he left before graduation , finished up at M. I. T. in 1914 . He joined Glenn Martin at Los Angeles as chief engineer , left in 1917 to become chief designer for the aviation section of the U. S. signal corps . In 1920 Donald Douglas , at 28 , started his own company , on a shoestring . He won a Navy contract against heavy competition , built four planes for the Army 's round-the-world flight in 1924 , concentrated on military aviation until 1930 . <P> His real fame did not come until this year when his big , all-metal , high-speed , 14-passenger transports began replacing other older makes on the nation 's airways . His factory at Santa Monica , which employed 600 hands a year ago , today has 3,200 . So great is the world 's admiration for the Douglas Airliner that even when Douglas Aircraft Co. omitted its semi-annual dividend last February-cash was needed to finance unfilled orders-the stock strengthened its position in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 42 looks younger than his years . He shuns crowds , prefers the company of a few old cronies . A mediocre pilot , he rarely flies his own planes but does most of his business traveling by regular airlines . His days off he spends yachting . His six-meter boat Gallant represented the U. S. in the last Olympics , and his schooner Endymion has been Pacific Coast champion for the past four years .
