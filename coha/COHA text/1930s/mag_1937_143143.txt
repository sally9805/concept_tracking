In the year 1822 a high-minded little group of men led by an M. P. from Galway , Richard ( " Humanity " ) Martin , gathered at Old Slaughter 's Coffee House in London , and formed the first Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals . In the same year they induced Parliament to pass a bill to punish persons who ' ' wantonly and cruelly " beat or ill-treated horses , mares , geldings , mules , asses , oxen , cows , heifers , steers , sheep . <P> In the year 1864 one Henry Bergh , son of a wealthy New York shipbuilder , returned to the U.

A. and the American Humane Association , although the friendship is not entirely reciprocated , are numerous national and local antivivisectionist societies which devote their energies to attacking scientists who use animals for experiments .

Most prolific distributor of antivivisectionist literature is the Vivisection Investigation League , headed by 81-year-old Sue M. Farrell , who learned her humanitarianism direct from agnostic Robert Ingersoll ; anti-vivisectionists also include such unusual celebrities as Fannie Hurst , George Arliss , Ellen Glasgow , Mahatma Gandhi . Irene Castle McLaughlin , but their societies were not officially represented in Milwaukee .
