txt Poe Drawings . To the Editor of The New York Times : I read in THE TIMES of Sept. 22 your long article have the three drawings alleged to ave been made by E. A. Poe , and the statement that they were unknown to Poe students . There have been on exhibit for quite awhile , and are still at the Poe shrine , at Richmond , Va. , photographs of the three pictures you printed , and they give more information than yours , especially that designated . as Mrs. Shelton , which Is dated 1845 , making it plain , with the facts known , that Poe could not have made that drawing . The picture called Poe 's also has an autograph , but not made by him . The mysterious American resident in Italy whose name is withheld in your article is , I believe , W. Mills . I had correspondence with him when I was president of the Poe shrine some eight years ago . At that time there was another picture , disputed by myself , which I understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any mention at that time of the " 0 Reilly , " but do remember that a nice story was woven around the Stanard family 's old homestead , now the Westmoreland Clubhouse , where the drawings originated in some manner . I could not verify all that was claimed , and candidly wrote the holder that I did not believe his drawings were authentic . And now , after another study , with the drawings before me , I do not believe that Poe had anything to do with them . J. H. WHITTY . Richmond , Va. , Sept. 26 , 1930.
