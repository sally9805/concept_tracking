txt Among those who did not like Chicago 's weather yesterday was Robert William Gilmore , 27 years old , an optician . Walking onto a dock near the Wabash avenue bridge lie yelled to some river gazers at the rail : " It 's too Md . " Nobody seemed Io believe him , so Gilmore took off his garments , beginning with his overcoat , and peeling clown to his underwear . Then , with a loud whoop , he plunged into the river . Coast guardsmen from the cutter Rush went in a boat to aid him . He pulled two of them into the water before he was subdued , and the three were rescued . On the cutter he informed Chief Boatswain 's Mate Thomas Andreasen that he was still warm and expected to continue that way until more liquor sweated out . Later he told policemen who took charge of him that he lived at 3330 Flournoy street .
