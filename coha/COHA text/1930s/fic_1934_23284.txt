AWFUL HEAVY A STORY BY DOROTHY THOMAS M RS . RALPH PIERCE called her son Johnny in from where he was playing baseball with Freddie Patterson , the McCall twins , and a few other boys on the vacant lot just back of the Pierce place , and told him to wash his neck and ears " good , " to put on his clean " good " shirt and his " good " pants , and to shine his shoes . " Aw , where we goin ' ? " Johnny asked , striking the ball in his mitt and frowning . " I 'm pitchin ' , mama ! " " That 's all right ! " Mrs. Ralph Pierce said . " I 'm going to stop in and sec Auntie Opal Griggs , and then I 'm going downtown , and then I 'm going to the Congregational dinner , and you 're going with me . " " Aw , mama ! " Johnny said . " Now , not a word , " Mrs. Pierce said . " Get cleaned up while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , Johnny ? " It was a fine sunny afternoon in early March , and making calls on old women was certainly the last thing Johnny Pierce wanted to do . He wanted to go play ball . He was about to protest again when the thought of seeing Old Auntie Opal Griggs in bed struck him as interesting . He wondered if she would n't look even fatter in bed than she looked on her feet . She looked almost as fat behind as before , and her fat seemed to be softer than pillows . He made for the door . " Johnny ! " his mother called , " where are you go-ing ? " " No place , " Johnny said . " I 'm just going out to give Freddie my mitt . I 'll be right back . " " Freddie ! " he began to bawl when he came near the diamond . " Come over here . I got somethin ' to tell you ! " " Listen , " he said , in a very confidential tone when Freddie ran to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ga-in ' ? " " Where ? " Freddie asked , folding his arms and setting his feet wide apart . Johnny poked him in the chest with a forefinger . " I , " he said pompously , " am going , as soon as I get cleaned up , to see Old Mrs , Opal Fatty Griggs in bed ! " Several boys had come up and were standing near , breathing loudly from running . " In bed ? " Freddie said . " What 's she in bed for ? Is she sick ? " " Naw . Just a sprained ankle . " He put out his hand , the mitt still on it , and slapped Freddie on the chest . " Do n't you get it , fellow ? " he said . " She 's softer ' n putty . Lyin ' down , I bet she 'll be three feet high . Anyway , three feet ! And I bet she 's gamin ' weight tool " " Johnny ! " Mrs. Pierce called from the back porch . " Get on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Johnny said , backing away from Freddie . " It 'll be a cir-cusl You can use my mitt , Freddie . Catch ! " It was some satisfaction to Johnny when he and his mother started down the street to see the ball game come to a halt and to know that all the boys were envying him . " I should have been in to see Auntie Opal Griggs before this , " Mrs. Pierce said , more to herself than to Johnny , as she walked briskly along . " I think everybody 's been to see her but me . I guess her ankle was real bad . " " Mama , how much do you suppose she weighs ? " " Who , son ? " " Aw , Auntie Opal Griggs . " " Why , I have n't any idea , but plenty . " " Is it true she could go in a circus if she wanted to ? " " I do n't know . She would n't think of such a thing . " " Well , what do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no idea . " " Well , make a guess , ca n't you ? " " I 've no idea . I do n't think she 's been weighed since  --  well , last time I remember hearing anybody say anything about her getting weighed was before I was married . " " Honest ? Well , what did she weigh then ? " " Oh , I do n't remember . But it was so much Nat McCall put it in the paper and she said she 'd never be weighed again . She 's one of the six fattest women in America , Nat McCall said in the write-up . She 'll never get weighed again . " " Not ever ? " " I guess so . Be still . They might hear you . " Johnny picked blistered paint from the porch trellis while his mother rang the bell . Mrs. Pierce , her eyes on Auntie Opal Griggs ' carpet-swathed rose bushes , smoothed first one of her kid gloves and then the other , andraised her brows and fixed her mouth for a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be opened . Adelaide Whitaker came to the door , let them in , and asked them to take off their things . " Why , I did n't know you were here , Adelaide , " Mrs. Ralph Pierce cried . " I knew Auntie Griggs had a bad sprain , but I did n't know she was bad enough to have you . " " Oh , I should say so , " Adelaide said , putting her hands in the pockets of her uniform and making the stiff muslin crackle pleasantly . " The doctor took me off the Holloway case the day Auntie Griggs was hurt and brought me over here . Oh , I tell you , Mrs. Pierce , nobody but a registered nurse could take care of Auntie Griggs , helpless as she is . And there 's plenty I ca n't do for her alone . Why , I could n't begin to turn her or lift her by myself . I have to have help . Why , to turn her I have to call in Mrs. Gallagher and one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leavitt and Mrs. Reaves . She 's an awfully heavy woman , Mrs. Pierce . " " Oh , I 'm sure , " Mrs. Pierce said . " Just about what do you think she weighs , Miss Whitaker ? " Johnny put in . " Hush , " his mother said . Miss Whitaker paid no attention to him . " I was hoping someone would come so I could feel free to leave her a little while and go in the kitchen and iron my caps , and my other uniform , " she said . " I have them sprinkled down . " " I 'm sure I can stay that long , " Mrs. Pierce said . " Come on , " Miss Whitaker said , and led the way down a strip of grass carpet along the hall to the back of the house . " Her room 's back here , just across from the kitchen , " she explained , " to save her steps when she 's up . She just about lives in the kitchen , I guess , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner . Oh , whatever you do , " she cautioned in a whisper , " do n't let out a word about the Congregational dinner . We 've had to keep it from her , of course . " " Of course , " Mrs. Pierce said . " What for ? " Johnny asked . " Because she 's always taken charge of the dinners . If she knew they were having one without her she 'd go all to pieces . " " Would she ? " Johnny asked . " Be still , " his mother said , and Adelaide opened the door for them into Mrs. Griggs ' bedroom . " I 've brought you some visitors , " Adelaide Whitaker said brightly . " They 'll sit with you awhile . " " Well , if it is n't Mrs. Ralph Pierce ! " a breathy voice came from the bed . " How are you , Mrs. Pierce ? And you brought your boy . My , how he 's grown ! " Mrs. Pierce went to the bed , and Johnny , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an elongated pink balloon rise slowly from the bed . The hand at the end of the arm was very small and dimpled like a baby 's . Johnny was told to come close and shake the hand . Auntie Opal Griggs smiled up at him from among her chins . The size of the hill she made lying on the bed was even greater than Johnny had hoped to see . " Just how did you hurt your ankle ? " Mrs. Pierce asked when she and Johnny were seated . " How did you ever come to hurt it ? " Auntie Opal Griggs turned her head gently from side to side on the pillow , raised the little hands droopingly , and let them fall . " Oh , I hardly know , " she said . " Just stepped down off the step , and somehow my ankle turned and let me down  --  just sorta give way under meand let me down . I called out , and Mrs. Gallagher and Mr. Gallagher and the Gallagher girls come running over and someone called Mrs. Shell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ankle was paining me so  --  so as I could get my foot out in front of me , and then some of the other neighbors were there , and they all got me up and in . Just carried me really , and the doctor came and taped it up and then got Adelaide in to do for me . It was an awfully bad sprain , Mrs. Pierce . Want to see it ? Just lift the covers there where the pillow is . You see I have to keep it on a pillow . " Mrs. Pierce lifted the covers as tenderly as though she were about to look on a newborn babe and exposed Auntie Griggs ' calves , that made Johnny think of nothing so much as two pink butcher-shop pigs , and her two little doll-like feet . One of the feet was bound about with adhesive tape . " Tchk , tchk , tchk , " Mrs. Pierce pitied , her hands on her cheeks . She gently covered the little feet and the great legs . " Is n't that awful , Johnny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gee , " Johnny said through his teeth . " It is n't as bad at it might be , " Auntie Opal Griggs said . " Now the real pain is over it 's not so bad . And it is n't like I was needed awfully bad right now . I 'll be up and around in a few weeks . I 'll be up before the Mother and Daughter banquet . " Mrs. Pierce pursed her lips . " Of course you will , " she said . " I think how Grandpa Beckelheimer has to sit in his wheelchair all the time , and how poor Mrs. Ira Hensley had to he in that cast so long . They say Ira wore out four back scratchers , running ' em down her neck in under that cast , four Chinese back scratchers , to scratch her back for her where that cast made her back itch her , and her not able to get at it . Ira 's a good man and I 'm glad Mary 's spared to him and out of that cast now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thankful for . I 'll be up before that banquet , and I might 've broke my limb . That was such a fall ! And I 'm a real heavy woman . " Johnny leaned forward . " About how much do you think .. . " he began , but his mother laid a hand on his knee . He was surprised at the strength of her fingers . There came a tap at the door and Mrs. Beulah DeLacey walked in , taking long knee-bent steps and holding her red pocketbook far out to one side and her glasses , on their black silk cord , far out on the other . She shook her purple feathered head at Auntie Opal Griggs . " Why , you dear old thing ! " she screamed . " Are n't you ashamed of yourself , to go fall like that and ' prain your ankle ? How are you , anyway ? I saw Adelaide out on the back steps , talking to Mrs. Gallagher , and so I just walked in . " " Hello , Beulah , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Mrs. Pierce and this is Mrs. Pierce 's little boy Johnny . " Mrs. Beulah DeLacey laid her pocketbook on the bed and grasped Mrs. Pierce 's hand in both her thin ones and screeched , " Oh , Mrs. Ralph Pierce . I have met both the other Mrs. Pierces but I had n't had the pleasure of meeting Mrs. Ralph Pierce . " Then , turning to Johnny , she cried , " I 'm so gladl " Mrs. DeLacey sat down on the bed and bobbed her feathers and tapped Auntie Griggs ' near arm with her gloved finger tips . " I 've been so ashamed not to have come before , " she said , " but I 've been so busy selling tickets for the dinner . " " Dinner ! " Auntie Griggs puffed . " What dinner , Mrs. DeLacey ? " Mrs. DeLacey felt Mrs. Pierce 's heel on her toe , and gave a hoarse gasp and put her hand over her mouth . " Oh , what have I donel " she squealed. rye gone and let the cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Please , Mrs. Griggs , do n't give me away . Do n't tell anybody 1 told you ! " Auntie Griggs put out a hand on either side of her and grasped a handful of bedding . The mountain heaved under the bedclothes . " When is this dinner ? " she asked , " and how big a dinner is it ? " " It 's to-night , " Mrs. DeLacey mourned loudly , " and I 've sold one hundred and sixty-eight tickets  --  I and the high-school girls . We had a contest . Oh , I 'm always putting my foot in it ! " Auntie Griggs was trying to boost herself up . " Where is Adelaide , " she gasped . " Get me Adelaide in here . " " Johnny , run , " Mrs. Pierce cried . " Run get Adelaide . " Johnny ran through the kitchen and out the back door and there , by the cistern pump , with Auntie Griggs ' gray-green shawl over her shoulders , Adelaide Whitaker was talking to Auntie Griggs ' Irish neighbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Johnny said . " She 's told her about the church dinner ! Mrs. DeLacey didl " " The Saints help and keep us ! " Mrs. Gallagher cried . " And 1 left her just for a minute , and Mrs. Pierce right there ! " Adelaide wailed . And shoulder to shoulder , she and Mrs. Gallagher ran in through the kitchen . The Gallagher girls had heard the shouting and came running after and were in before the Gallagher back door slammed to . " Lift inc up ! " Mrs. Griggs demanded , the minute the four women got in the room . Then , " Shame on you , Adelaide Whitaker , for keepin ' this from me ! Shame on all of you . " " But , Auntie , " Adelaide protested , " we knew you were n't fit to go , and we did n't want to bother you with it . " AWFUL " Bother , your foot ! " Auntie Griggs said when they had boosted her to a sitting position . " Mrs. DeLacey , who 's takin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty-eight tickets for ? " Mrs. DeLacey batted her eyes and swallowed in her long throat . " Why , no one in particular , Mrs. Griggs , " she said . " The ladies are just working together on it . " " Listen , " Auntie Griggs said . " A church dinner ai n't got that way . A church dinner is run . Who 's runnin ' this one ? Who 's plannin ' and buyin ' and seein ' there 's enough and that everything 's done right ? Who 's runnin ' this dinner ? " " I told you , " Mrs. DeLacey said , " the women are working together . The women in our church do work together beautifully . No particular one is in charge . " The balloon armswere raised . " Adelaide ! Bring me my clothes . " " Oh , I ca n't , " Adelaide said . " I 'm in charge of you , Mrs. Griggs , and I ca n't . " " Adelaide Whitaker , " Auntie Griggs said , " do as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mrs. Gallagher came close and took one of the little dimpled hands in hers , arresting their waving . " There , Lamb , " she said . " You ca n't be goin ' down there in the shape you 're in . And I 'd be a poor neighbor to let you . " " Now , Maggie , do n't stand in my way , " Auntie Griggs said . " You know what your religion is to you and you know what mine is to me , when there 's a dinner to , be seen to most of all . I 've had the charge of , and see to , of every dinner the Congregationalists have put on in twenty years and I 'll have the see to of this one . Do you want ' em to ruin a dinner or run out of food and the people not half fed yet ? Johnny ! Johnny Pierce ! Come here , boy . " I want you to do something for me . I want you to run to Grandpa Beckelheimer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon and evening . He can go to bed that long and it wo n't hurt him a lick . Runt " Johnny ran all the way to Grandpa Beckelheimer 's and was blowing so when he got there that he could hardly get his wind to tell Grandma Beckelheimer what it was he wanted . Then he had to wait while Grandma Beckelheimer made it clear to Grandpa Beck-el heimer that it was his wheelchair that was wanted and that it was Auntie Opal Griggs who wanted it . " Well , I guess so , " he said at last . " I 'll let her have it , but if she breaks it to smithereens she 'll get me a new one , that 's what . " Grandma Beckelheimer helped Johnny get the chair down off the porch , cautioning him to go slowwith it . " I 'll wager anything , Opal ' 11 smash it , " she said . " She 's such a fat woman . " " Around what do you think she 'd weigh ? " Johnny yelled in Grandma Beckelheimer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , " the old woman said , rolling her eyes . " More'n most families put together , I expect . You be careful , little boy . " Once out of sight of Grandpa and Grandma Beckelheimer 's house , Johnny ran . The wheels squeaked and Battered alarmingly . By the time he got to Auntie Opal Griggs ' place , eight other boys were running with him . Freddie Patterson was one of them , and Johnny chose him to go into the house with him and help wheel the chair down the hallway to Auntie Griggs ' bedroom . Adelaide and Mrs. Gallagher and Johnny 's mother and the other women were having quite a time with Mrs. Griggs . " Get me my clothes , Adelaide , " she had said again the minute Johnny had been sent on his errand . She was firm , and Adelaide at last brought out a knit-ted cotton vest as big as a small tent and a pair of umbrella drawers that would have made petticoats for all the Gallagher girls , and a knitted underskirt that Grandma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grandpa Beckelheimer took to his chair and wanted her sitting by him every minute , and a gray percale mother-hubbard dress . The ladies helped Auntie Griggs into her clothes . She was sitting on her bed , dressed all but her shoes , her black-stockinged feet dangling at the end of her very large legs , when Johnny and Freddie came in with the - wheelchair . Auntie Opal Griggs took one good look at the wheelchair and lay back on the bed . Adelaide lifted her bad leg up for her , and Mrs. Gallagher lifted the good one . " It 's too little , " Auntie Griggs said . " Grandpa Beckelheimer 's no bigger'n a locust , is he ? " " It 's all right , you 're tired , " Mrs. Gallagher said . " We 'll get your things off and get you back under the covers . " Auntie Griggs bent one of the great arms and put her hand to her forehead . " Be still , Maggie , " she said . " Let me think . " The five women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman on the bed thought . " Well , I 'd like to stay and do something , " Mrs. DeLacey broke in , " but I have to get on down to the church . I know the ladies miss you , and I 'll tell them that you tried to come . I 'm awfully sorry you fell and hurt yourself . " " And I wish you 'd fall and break your neck , " Mrs. Gallagher said when Mrs. DeLacey had taken her feathers and her red pocketbook through the door . " No , I would n't with that on anybody , " Auntie Griggs said . " I 've thought of it ! Johnny , " she said , and Johnny and Freddie Patterson stepped forward , their shoulders well back . " Will you do something for me ? Well , run down to Atherton 's Drug Store and tell Arch Atherton he 's to send me up a pair of crutches , the strongest he 's got in the shop . " Adelaide , bring me my pocketbook outa the drawer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Adelaide brought the pocketbook and Mrs. Griggs opened it and got out her billfold and counted out three one-dollar bills and then put one of them back in the fold . She laid the two bills in Johnny 's hand . " There , " she said . " They ai n't likely to be more'n that . If they are , tell Arch to put the difference down for me . Run ! " Johnny and Freddie Patterson ran all the way , with Johnny a little ahead . " We want a pair of crutches , " they puffed when they found Arch in the back room of the drug store , monkeying with a tiny pair of scales . " They 're for Auntie Opal Griggs , " Freddie said . " She wants to go to the Congregationalists ' church dinner . " Arch Atherton was fooling with the little pair of scales . " Get out ! " he said . " I got only two pair of crutches and they would n't either one of them be strong enough for Mrs. Griggs . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnny said . " She sent us for ' em . " " One 's a big pair and one 's a little pair . They would n't fit her , either of them , and they 'd never hold her up if she could use ' em . " Johnny squinted up at Arch Atherton . " Whatta you think she 'll weigh , Doc ? " he asked like a man . " Oh . I do n't know , kid , " Arch said , pleased , as he always was , when anybody called him Doc . " I would n't have any idea . Tell you what you do . You run over to the hardware store and tell Stanley to come on over here and bring a saw . Maybe we can fix that bigger pair . " A minute later Stanley Hopper came in with the boys at his heels . " Here 's your saw , Arch , " he said . " Bring out those crutches . " They had quite a time deciding how many inches to saw off the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to just how tall Auntie Griggs was and how long a crutch she would need . " You ca n't tell , an awful fat woman like that , just how tall she might be , " Stanley Hopper said gravely . " You see she 's got no proportion . All that flesh ! " " How much would you judge she weighs , Mr. Hopper ? " Johnny asked . " I would n't have any notion , son . I would n't know how to make an estimate . No , I just would n't know how to make an estimate . " Stanley Hopper was trying his weight on the crutches , swinging both legs . " Do you think they 'll ever hold her up , Arch ? " " No , " said Arch . " No , I do n't believe they will . She 's an awful heavy woman , Stanley . " The two men looked at each other and shook their heads , their mouths drawn in tight lines . Stanley was still swinging on the crutches . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , Arch . Awful heavy ! " " Tell you what you might do , Stanley , " Arch Atherton said . " You might take ' em over to the store and wire a couple of iron rods to the lower part of ' cm . You might do that . Think that might be a good idea ? " " Well , we can sure try it , Arch , " Stanley Hopper said . " Comin ' with me , boys ? " Johnny Pierce and Freddie Patterson went with Stanley Hopper to the hardware store and stood by while Stanley wired a couple of iron rods to the sawed-off crutches . When he had them fixed he gave one to each boy and said , " There you are , boys . Sec if they wo n't hold the old girl up . Better run . " They ran all the way back to Auntie Opal Griggs ' place . There were the Yoder boys , and the McCall boys , and half the Bickel boys , and the little Fisher girl running with them by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yard . " Good ! " Auntie Opal Griggs said when they came in the door . " Good ! How much were they , boys ? " " He did n't say , " Johnny Pierce said , and took the two dollars out of his pocket and gave them back to Auntie Griggs . " Stanley Hopper fixed ' em , " Freddie said . " Did n't charge a thing ! " " That was nice , " Auntie Griggs said . " And thank you , boys . Mrs. Gallagher 's sent for her brother 's boy to bring around his truck , and if I can just walk out to it on these , and they can get me up in , I 'll get there , and get that dinner yet . Help me up , will you , girls ? " Mrs. Ralph Pierce , Adelaide Whitaker , Mrs. Gallagher and her daughters , and Mrs. Shell Thompson , who had come in while Johnny and Freddie Patterson had gone for the crutches , lifted Auntie Opal up . " I 'd think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time we had gettin ' you to bed when you hurt your ankle , and stay where you are , Auntie . " " Oh , be still , child , " Auntie Griggs said , not too unkindly . " Do n't you think I know what I 'm Join ' ? " When she stood poised on one of her little dolly feet , Johnny Pierce put a crutch under her left arm , and Freddie Patterson put the crutch he held under her right . " Careful there , son ! " Mrs. Ralph Pierce admonished . " There ! That 's fine . Leave me stand on ' em , " Auntie Opal Griggs said , and the women let go of her and stood close , their hands ready to catch her should she waver . Resting on her good foot , she set the crutches a little ahead . " Now what ? What do I do ? " she asked helplessly . " You hop , " Johnny said . " Ya , you just take a little hop , " Freddie advised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how I 'm goin ' to do it , " Auntie Griggs said . " You just lift your good foot and set it down , up ahead , " Freddie said . " All right , " said Auntie Griggs . " I 'll try it ! " and hopped . There was a sound of splintering wood , and many arms went about Auntie Griggs . Among them they got her back on the bed . " Thanks , girls , " Auntie Griggs panted . " If you had n't been there those things woulda let me right down ! What do you suppose Arch meant by sendin ' me up a couple of flimsy sticks like that ? Mrs. Gallagher , ai n't your boy , your nephew , I mean , come yet ? " " He 's here , " Mrs. Gallagher said . " He 's backed right up to the back door . But you wo n't want him now , will you , Mts . Griggs dear ? " " Yes , I do , Mrs. Gallagher , " Auntie Griggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prop me up a little , will you ? " Bart O'Halloran came in , his hoots making a great noise on the floor . " How do you do , Mrs. Griggs , " he said . " Aunt Maggie says you wanted me . " " Bart , " Auntie Opal Griggs said , " do n't it say on your truck , ' We move anything ' ? " " It sure does , " Bart O'Halloran said , " and I ai n't braggin ' . " " It 's true ? " " Well , I put the radiators in the schoolhouse and I brought the sheets of plate glass up from the freight house to Atherton 's Drug Store . " " Bart , I need to go down to the Congregational Church , and I need to go right away . I shoulda been there hours ago . Can you get me there ? " " I think so , " Bart O'Halloran said . " I 'll sure do my best , Mrs. Griggs . " " You see , " Auntie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinners since before you was born , boy , and I do n't know what 'll happen and me not down there . I 'm needed . It 's down to the kitchen in the church basement I want to go , Bartle . " " All right , " Bart O'Halloran said , " I 'll get you there . You just wait until I get my moving crew up here . I 'll have to telephone and get me some help . " " The ' phone 's in the kitchen , " Auntie Griggs said . Mrs. Gallagher had begun to weep aloud . " And Mrs. Griggs dear , " she said , " the boy 'll get you there just as quick and safe as if it was a Catholic dinner you was goin ' to . " " I trust he will , " Mrs. Griggs said . " Adelaide , if you 'll fetch me my shawl and put on my shoe , I 'll be ready . " Johnny Pierce and Freddie Patterson followed Bart into the kitchen and stood near while he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one knee on the great red plush sofa Auntie Opal had in her kitchen to sit on between spells of cooking . Johnny Pierce stood admiring Bart 's heavy boot . To himself he counted the eyelets of the lacing . " What do you think , Mr. O'Halloran , " he asked , " about what do you think Auntie Opal Griggs would weigh ? " " Your guess is as good as mine , Bud , " Bart O'Halloran said . " She 's an awful big woman . " Central had got the freight house for him . " Hello , Charlie , " he said . " Would you get Beef Woodruff and Ted Calhoun and Herb Sass and his dad to come on up here , to Mrs. Griggs ' , next door south of my Aunt Maggie 's house ? I do n't know whether we 'll need ' em or not , but bring the dolly and slings for movin ' pianos ... . O.K. " Bart rubbed his stubbled chin for a moment and then said , " You two kids grab hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lift it . Fine ! I 'll take the head , and you kids carry that end , and well take it in the old lady 's room . Pretty heavy , ai n't it ? " It was all Johnny and Freddie could do to carry their end of the sofa . " Wheel " they puffed together when they set it down beside Auntie Griggs ' bed . " Now , Aunt Maggie , if you and the ladies will just roll her off onto this , " Ban said . The ladies got Auntie Griggs onto the sofa . Adelaide put a pillow and a hot-water bottle under her sprained foot and another pillow under her head , and Mrs. Gallagher tucked a quilt round her . When another truck and a car pulled up beside Bart 's , and the crew knocked at the back door , Bart said , " Now , Mrs. Griggs , we 'll have you there in a jiffy . " The men came on in and with Bart and Ted Calhoun at the head , Beef Woodruff and Herb Sass on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they lifted the sofa with Auntie Opal Griggs on it and carried it out and slid it into Bart 's truck . A crowd of neighbors and passers-by had gathered and stood about in the yard watching . " I do n't see why you do n't take her in the car instead of in your truck , " one of the smaller Gallagher girls said to her Uncle Bart . " Then you do n't see good , " Bart said grinning . Auntie Griggs heard the child and said gently , " They make the car doors so very little , Molly . " Bart was going to do the driving himself . Ted Calhoun and Beef Woodruff rode inside the truck to keep the sofa from sliding about . Adelaide Whitaker , who had not ceased to protest under her breath , and Mrs. Pierce and Mrs. Shell Thompson rode inside too , to look after Auntie Opal Griggs . Mrs. Pierce did not see Johnny climb into the driver 's seat beside Bart . When the car and the other truck had driven out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned carefully onto Plum Street , and drove slowly toward Main Street . " Do you know what my mother said ? " Johnny ventured , looking up into Bart 's face . " She says that Auntie Opal Griggs wo n't get weighed  --  that she ai n't been weighed since she do n't know how long . Not since before mama was married . " " I guess that 's right , " Bart said . " Well , would n't you kinda like to know what she weighs now ? " " Yes , I would , " Bart said . " Well , do n't you wish there was some way we could find out ? " " I guess the only way 'd be to weigh her . " " Well , how could you , if she wo n't get weighed ? " " Just go ahead and weigh her , I guess . " " Could you ? " " Sure . " " How ? " " You watch . " At the corner of Mulberry and Main , Bart turned the truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not Mulberry , it 's Cherry ! The Congregational 's on Cherry ! " Shouts came from inside the truck . Bart paid no attention and kept right on the way he was started until he reached the elevator and stopped on the little platform beside the elevator office . He got down , went round to the back of the truck , and said , " I got to speak to Charlie Morse in here , Mrs. Griggs . " " That 's all right , Bartie , I 'll wait , " Auntie Griggs said . Bart went inside and spoke to one of the men , took an envelope and wrote some figures on it , and came back out and climbed up to his place at the wheel . He handed the envelope to Johnny . " Got a pencil ? " he asked . " There 's what the load weighs , and there 's the truck , empty . I weigh a hundred and ninety-seven . You can get Beef 's and Ted 's weight when we get down to the church . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot , Bart . I guess I can go on from there . Thanks a lot ! " He put down Bart 's weight with a pencil that shook more than the jolting of the truck warranted , and put the envelope in his pocket . There was great commotion when Bart and Ted , Beef Woodruff and Herb Sass and his dad carried Auntie Opal Griggs on her red sofa down the stairs into the Congregational church basement . The Congregational women laid down their bread knives and ladles , their rolling pins and platters , and exclaimed with astonishment and delight . There was no one who could run a church dinner like Auntie Opal Griggs . They had all been blaming the leaders for daring to try to give one with her down on her back and not able to tell them what to do , and now they rejoiced at her almost miraculous arrival . The men let her sofa down between the great range and the long kitchen table , and she began at once to take charge and to see to things . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she asked . " Fine ! That 's a big plenty . " What are you and Mrs. Lamborne making there , Mrs. Bright ? Let me taste it . " Outside , with Ted 's and Beef 's weights added below Bart 's on his envelope , Johnny was gathering his gang around him . He sat down an the top basement step and when he had quieted them all with a " Shut up , kids . I got something to tell you ! " he said , " Well , I 'm about to get something figured out that nobody 's known since before any of you kids was born . Bart O'Halloran and me weighed Auntie Opal Griggs . We weighed her down to the elevator . " " No foolin ' ? " Freddie said . " What 's she weigh , Johnny ? " " I got to do a little figurin ' before I can tell you , " Johnny said . " You kids can help . Twins , you can run down to the Shell Thompsons ' and ask the kids what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fisher , you can run down to the Whitakers ' and ask the Whitaker girls what Adelaide weighs in her nursing clothes . Write it down when you get it . I know what my mother weighs and I got down what I weigh already . I 'll add it all up , and then take it and what the truck weighs away from what the load weighed and I 'll have it . I 'll have what Auntie Griggs weighs , to the pound . Think , kids . Everybody says she 's heavier than the fat woman that was here in the circus last summer and she ai n't been weighed since before any of us standin ' here was born . " Tommy Fisher was standing scratching her head and sniffing an empty perfume bottle she had picked up somewhere and carried about with her . " Ya , and what about the sofa ? " she piped . " What about that big old sofa ? " " That 's right ! " Johnny said . " Ya , " Freddy took up Tommy 's suggestion as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you gain ' to know when you get through subtractin ' how much you got left is Auntie Griggs and how much is sofa ? " " That 's what we got to figure out , I guess , " Johnny said . " I know ! " one of the twins said . " You got to get her off the sofa and take the sofa back down to the elevator and weigh it by itself . " " I 'll go back down in the basement , " Johnny said , " and take a look at her and see if I can think of something . You can think of something a lot better if you 're lookin ' at it . " " I ca n't , " Tommy Fisher said . " I can think of something a lot better if I 'm lookin ' at something else . What you got to do is get her up off'n that sofa . " " That 's what I said , " Johnny said . " You kids stay here , ' cept you that has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stood quietly in a corner well out of the way . Women were bringing bowls and spoonfuls of food to Auntie Griggs to sample and judge . Over in another corner Johnny saw a much used butcher-shop cutting block that had been Mr. Schafer 's contribution when the Congregational church kitchen was furnished . It was a great round block of wood that stood on three very sturdy wooden legs . Johnny went to Auntie Griggs and said , " How are you feelin ' , Mrs. Griggs ? " She put out one of her little hands and gave his arm a pat . " I feel fine , Johnny , " she said , " and I want to thank you for all you done to help me . " " That 's all right , " Johnny said , " but ai n't you afraid , Mrs. Griggs , that somebody 'll spill somethin ' on you and scald you , here so close to the stove , and them passin ' stuff back and forth over you like they are ? " " Oh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't room for the sofa anyplace else , Johnny . " " You just wait , Mrs. Griggs ! " he said . " You just wait , " and shot out the door and up the basement steps . " Who of you kids live closest to here ? " he demanded . " I do , " said Preachie Matson . " Ya , " one of the kids said , " he lives right here in the parsonage . " " Well , all right , Preachie , " Johnny said . " You skin over home and get out with a good soft comfort and a mess of pillows . " Johnny waited , pacing up and down the church walk . When Preachie came with the bedding , he took it all , the comfort under one arm and the three pillows under the other , and carried them down to the kitchen and arranged them on the chopping block in the kitchen corner . Mrs. Bright noticed him and said , " Johnny Pierce , whatever are you doing ? " " I 'm fixing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Auntie Griggs when she saw what he had done was highly pleased . " Well , did you ever hear of anything more thoughtful ? " she said . " If you can get me up on that , I can set up and put my foot on the flour bin , and be dear outa the way . " Any number of women volunteered to help move Auntie , and Johnny said , " And I 'll take the sofa up outside so 's it wo n't be in the way . " He ran up the steps and called for help . In three minutes Auntie Griggs was enthroned on the chopping block and the red plush sofa was outdoors in the grass beside the church walk . " Now what we got to do , " Johnny said , " is get her down to the elevator and weigh her , and there 's just one way to do it and that 's carry her . Freddie and me and the twins will take the big end and the rest of you kids , get hold anywheres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better get it up on our shoulders . " Ten boys and Tommy Fisher offered their services , even fought to be allowed to help carry the sofa . With it boosted to their shoulders , they carried it a block . " It 's too heavy , " Tommy insisted when they stopped for a breathing spell . " It 's cuttin ' my shoulder right off . What you ought a do is turn it over and have the soft part under for our shoulders . " " Ya , that 's what I was just thinking , " Freddie said . They turned the sofa over and lifted it not just to their shoulders , but to their heads . Marching on down Cherry until they came to Main , they rested , crossed , and went on down toward Plum . When they stopped to rest in front of the hardware store , Stanley Hopper came out and asked them where they were bound , and Johnny explained . " Well , you do n't have to go on off down there with that thing , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she weighs , myself . I got a scale in here 'll weigh her . You just bring her on in . " The sofa was hoisted once more and carried into the hardware store and set down on the scales at the back of the shop . " I bet we 'll all have stiff necks for a week , " Tommy said . When Stanley had weighed the sofa , the buys and Tommy all sat down on it , crowding close to Johnny to watch him figure . " Aw , do n't go to all that bother , " Stanley said . " You come on up to the office , Johnny , and add it on the adding machine . " The office was in a little pen at the front of the store . Johnny chose Freddie to come in and read the numbers for him , and Stanley Hopper showed Johnny how to operate the adding machine . Carefully , Freddie read the numbers out and Johnny put them down . He read the weights of all the people who had been in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adding machine and got the numbers down . When he had put down the weight of the truck and the sofa he took the total and subtracted it from the weight of the load . In an awed and questioning whisper he read the difference . " That 's it , " he said ; " Kids , that 's what she weighs to a pound . " " My , she sure is heavyl " someone exclaimed . " Oh , ya , " Tommy Fisher said , her perfume bottle under her freckled nose , " she 's a lot heavier'n that yet . " " She is not , " Johnny protested . " Whatta you say that for ? " " ' Cause she is , " Tommy insisted . " How d' you get that way ? " " Well , who 'd you say got down off'n that toad to tell ' m to weigh it ? " " Oh , that 's right . Bart did , " Johnny said . " That 's just what 1 was thinkin ' , " Freddie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She weighs a whole hundred and ninety-seven pounds more'n we got figured she did . " Carefully , with Freddie breathing in his ear , Johnny added one hundred and ninety-seven pounds " by hand . " " Well , boys , " Stanley Hopper said , " you got it . Yes , sir , you know what she weighs . " Johnny folded the piece of adding machine tape and put it in his shirt pocket . " Ya , " he said , " I got it ! Listen kids . . . Sayl Where 's the McCall twins ? " " Gone , " Tommy Fisher said , sniffing whistlingly over her bottle , " gone atearin ' to tell their dad so he can put it in the paper . "
