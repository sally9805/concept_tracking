Every summer many people are killed by lightning on U. S. golf courses ( see p. 20 ) . The U. S. Golf Association was acutely reminded of this fact last June when two spectators were killed and Golfer Horton Smith was grazed by lightning in the Kansas City Open. * Last week the U. S. G. A. advised its member clubs to post on their bulletin boards the following thunderstorm " don'ts " : <P> Do not raise clubs or umbrellas above one 's head during a thunderstorm . <P> Keep away from isolated trees , exposed sheds , wire fences , hilltops and wide open spaces , if possible . <P> Seek shelter in a cave , depression in the ground , deep valley , foot of a steep cliff , grove of trees . <P> <P> *Latest victim : Leonard T. Grant , onetime ( 1929 ) New York University football captain , killed last week while walking , club in hand , down the fairway of a Dedham ( Mass. ) golf course .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
