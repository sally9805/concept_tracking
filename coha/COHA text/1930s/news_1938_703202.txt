txt Theodore George Danielsen Jr. , born Feb. 6 , 1922 , slayer of his mother March.3 , 1938 , is a case before which religion , education , even science , may falter . There is no answer to this wild act except the depths of his nature , the potential black spots on the chain of his inherited character , plus perhaps the pressure and the contingencies of his recent environment . In " My Baby 's Book , " a pitiful record in the light of the mother 's death at her son 's hands , his mother recorded her love for him . The last entry follows : " Mother begins trying to teach Teddy key and notes on piano after his sixth birthday . Began Sunday school in September , 1926 , in the Rev. Linmeyer 's church . Liked his teacher . Enters first grade Jan. 30 , 1928 ; Miss Nelson , teacher . " " Little Teddy Bear . " He was " dear little Teddy bear " in those days , with his first reactions to the world written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthday , his first Easter , his first suit of clothes , his first prayer , his first words . One of his first expressions was " no sing . " Perhaps he objected unccnsciously to the attempt to make a musician out of him , the drawing him in from play , even as late as last week , so that he might practice on the piano . He has no appearance of a budding artist , but simply that of a rather ordinary looking , blond haired boy , a little pimply in complexion , of the age when girls do not count , but when the opinion of other boys does count . His Discipline Rigid . His mother rebuked him , sometimes slapped him , in the presence of other boys . He was kept under a rigid discipline , but was given plenty of toys and enough : . ' pending money so that he could go to games and movies . His mother was a nervous woman , whose shrill voice in scolding the boy could be heard sometimes by the neighbors . The boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and jolly with him , at least when other boys were around . His father says he , never whipped him , but slapped him a few times . From his statements in his confession Theodore would seem to be a typical boy and in some ways almost a model one . He did n't smoke , drink , gamble , or go out with girls . He never stayed out late nights ; in fact , seldom went out nights except for an occasional Sunday evening when he would visit other boys in their homes . Slow in Babyhood . There is nothing but normal family love , normal development in the baby years , the baby book indicates . Teddy was slow to creep , slow to walk , but grew vigorously from the 3 pounds 14 ounces at birth to the tall , stringy boy who sat before the police yesterday . In babyhood , they say , and up to the sixth or seventh year , the most important kinks are imbedded in human character . These kinks , however , would not be found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was afraid of strangers , even relatives , and at the age of 2 had a great desire for dolls and a dog . There is a lock of hair marked " 11 months " and it is fine and blond , " stubborn , " his mother called it . The boy disliked having it combed and brushed . Under the heading of " songs , " she wrote : " Mother sang little snatches of songs at different times . Teddy would listen quietly . Then came a time when either daddy or mother would sing and Teddy would say , ' No sing " . " There are many things that his baby book did not tell and many things his parents did not know . They did not know that he had skipped school 48 days the last year ; that he had taken to swearing ; that he wanted to run away . He was in the stage when it was the fashion to declare for bachelorhood . No girls , no parties for him . He liked basket . ball , skating , skiing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have taken to smoking marijuana cigarets , but there is no evidence of this , or of drinking . Reasons for Truancy . Just why Theodore skipped school he himself could not explain , but he did know , he said , that once he had started he kept it up . He did n't dislike school . He was average in his studies until he missed classes . Then he failed , and once he failed in all his subjects . An insight into his hitherto unknown character may be found in his admission that he dreaded showing the report card , with the failure marks , to his parents , and so he changed the marks . He says he spent much of hooky time in libraries , reading civil war stories , but librarians can not recall him . Sometimes he went to movies or roamed in the city . A Friend 's Story . John Mall , 16 years old , 5330 Ludlam avenue , said that young Danielsen , who had been his friend for ten years , seemed to like his father better than his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ted , " Mall explained . " They played ping-pong together . Ted did n't seem to get along so well with his mother . I saw her slap him several times . " Ted and I used to kid each other about having no girls . We called ourselves bachelors . I guess you 'd call him a normal boy in most ways . But when he got mad he 'd make faces and if he got in a fight he 'd scratch instead of sluaging . " " A Quiet Boy . " One of the Danielsen boy 's teachers , Miss Elizabeth Tendick , 6244 North Oakley avenue , said that he had n't attended any of his English classes since Feb. 1 . She described him as a quiet boy who seemed to make an effort to keep up with his studies . " But he was often absent in the term that began in September , " she said . " He appeared only two or three times a week , " Richard Ebner , 15 years old , 5483 Parkside avenue , who shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been to school at any time in February . Calls Slaying " Impulse . " In retrospect the young slayer says that he did not mind practicing at the piano unless it interfered with his fun . He was a clock watcher in this particular . There is a contradiction in the way in which he defends his mother now and the fact that he buried the knife in her twice , after an interval at which remorse might have struck him . Ills explanation of his act is that it was of an explosive nature , an impulse , but he roamed around the house , fed the dog , and then came and used the knife again . This on his mother , who was making a cherry pie for his supper . " I did n't think at all . I forgot . I wanted to get away " is all he has to say about it now , except that he is sorry . Her last word before her strangling " 0 " was to call him " useless " when he told her that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
