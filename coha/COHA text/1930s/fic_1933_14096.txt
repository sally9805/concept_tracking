The library of St. George 's Hospital . The staff of the hospital gather here to read , to smoke , and to discuss many things  --  primarily Medicine . This is a large , comfortable room flanked on the left by tall windows , on the right by ceiling-high bookcases crammed with heavy tomes . There is a bulletin board in one corner , on which various notices , announcements , advertisements , schedules , etc. , are tacked ; there is a long table , an abandon of professional magazines and pamphlets strewn upon it ; there are many plump , leather club chairs , some of which are occupied at the moment by members of the staff . In a series of stalls against the back wall are a number of phones . Niched high in the wall is a marble bust of Hippocrates , the father of Medicine , his kindly , brooding spirit looking down upon the scene . At the base of the bust is engraved a quotation from his Precepts : " Where the love of man is , there also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A number of the staff are smoking and chatting in small groups , the nucleus of each group being an older man in civilian clothes  --  an attending physician ; the young men , interns , recognizable by their white short-sleeved summer uniforms , are doing most of the listening , the older ones most of the talking , the hush of the room on their voices . One elderly , white-haired physician , seated well to the right , is straining his eyes over a thick medical volume . A number of other books and pamphlets are on a stool beside him . A middle-aged physician , his back to us , is searching the bookcase for a desired volume . A younger practitioner is standing by the window , looking out into the street . Through a wide , glass-panelled double door , set in the rear wall , we see a section of the corridor alive with its steady cavalcade of nurses , interns , etc. , all hurrying by to their separate tasks . The quick activity of the hospital outside contrasts noticeably with the classical repose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corridor calls : " Dr. Ramsey ! Dr. Ramsey ! Dr. Ramsey ! " Phone rings . An intern crosses to the phones , picks one up , talks in low tones . Enter DR . HOCHBERG , a short , vital man , whose large head is crowned by a shock of graying hair . He carries himself with quiet , simple dignity . There is strength in the set of his jaw ; but the predominating quality expressed in his face is a sweet compassion  --  a simple goodness . That he is a man of importance is at once apparent in the respectful attention bestowed on him by the others . DR . JOSH GORDON ( the middle-aged physician , who has just found his book ) , sees HOCHBERG:Ah , Dr. Hochberg ! I 've been waiting for you . He quickly replaces the volume and goes to HOCHBERG . The young practitioner by the window wheels round at the mention of HOCHBERG 'S name . p. 3 DR . JOSH GORDON There 's a patient I want you to see . DR . LEO HOCHBERG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute . I just  --  His eye sweeps the room.George Ferguson is n't here , is he ? DR . MICHAELSON ( one of the interns seated ) , looks up from his reading:No , Dr. Hochberg . Shall I call him ? DR . LEO HOCHBERG nods:Please . MICHAELSON rises and goes to a telephone . DR . VITALE ( the young practitioner ) , leaves the window and approaches HOCHBERG:Er Dr. Hochberg . DR . LEO HOCHBERG Good morning , Doctor . DR . VITALE I sent a patient of mine to your clinic yesterday . Did you have a chance to ? DR . LEO HOCHBERG recollecting:Oh  --  yes , yes . Reassuringly , knowing that this is perhaps VITALE 'S first private patient , and most likely a relative at that.No rush to operate there . You try to cure him medically first . DR . VITALE relieved:I see . All right , Doctor . Thank you . Thank you . p. 4 DR . LEO HOCHBERG Not at all . Keep in touch with me . Let me know what progress you make . DR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have to , we 'll operate . But I think if we wait on nature this case will respond to expectant treatment . DR . VITALE Right ! He goes . DR . JOSH GORDON shakes his head , kidding HOCHBERG:Fine surgeon you are  --  advising against operation ! DR . LEO HOCHBERG smiles and shrugs his shoulders:Why not give the patient the benefit of the doubt ? You can always operate ! That 's easy , Josh . DR . MICHAELSON returning from the phone:Dr . Ferguson 'll be right down , sir . DR . LEO HOCHBERG Thanks . DR . JOSH GORDON I hear you 've some interesting cases at your clinic . DR . LEO HOCHBERG Yes , yes  --  er  --  suppose you have dinner with me tonight . We 'll talk , hm ? I discovered a little place on Eighty-fourth Street where they serve the most delicious schnitzel and a glass of beer  --  Measuring it with his hands .  --  that high ! But beer ! p. 5 DR . JOSH GORDON Sounds good . I 'll just phone my wife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans ? DR . JOSH GORDON Oh , no ! He crosses to the phone . DR . LEO HOCHBERG approaches the white-haired physician and places a hand gently on his shoulder:And how is Dr. McCabe today ? DR . MCCABE My eyes are bothering me ! He indicates the pyramid of books beside his chair.Trying to read all of this new medical literature . It certainly keeps piling up ! He shakes his head.Has me worried ! DR . LEO HOCHBERG But , why ? DR . MCCABE nods toward interns:These young men today  --  how can they ever catch up with all this ? DR . LEO HOCHBERG These young men are all right . They 're serious  --  hard-working boys . I 've a lot of faith in them . DR . MCCABE But there 's so much . He shakes his head.We 've gone so far since I was a boy . In those days appendicitis was a fatal disease . Today it 's nothing . These youngsters take all that for granted . They do n't know the men who dreamed and sweated  --  to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All in my lifetime . I worked with Spencer Wells in London , and Murphy at Mercy Hospital . Great men . None of these youngsters will equal them . They ca n't . There 's too much ! I 'm afraid it will all end in confusion . p. 6 DR . LEO HOCHBERG Where the sciences in general are going to end , with their mass of detail  --  nobody knows . But , good men in medicine we 'll always have . Do n't worry , Dr. McCabe one or two of these boys may surprise you yet , and turn out another Murphy or another Spencer Wells . DR . MCCABE shaking his head:Not a Spencer Wells ! No ! Not a Spencer Wells ! HOCHBERG helps him rise.Chilly in here , is n't it ? He walks slowly to the door. I 'm always cold these days . He shakes his head.Bad circulation ! GORDON finishes his phone call , hangs up and crosses to HOCHBERG . DR . LEO HOCHBERG All right for dinner , Josh ? DR . JOSH GORDON Oh , of course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attending physician , DR . WREN , come up the corridor engaged in discussion . The intern stops outside the door to give some instructions to a passing nurse , who hastens to obey them . He pauses in the doorway of the library , still talking to DR . WREN . GEORGE FERGUSON is about twenty-eight ; handsome in an angular , manly fashion , tall , wiry , broad-shouldered , slightly stooped from bending over books and patients ; a fine sensitive face , a bit tightened by strain , eager eyes , an engaging earnestness and a ready boyish grin . p. 7 DR . GEORGE FERGUSON If we used Dakin tubes it might help . DR . WREN They 're worth a trial ! DR . GEORGE FERGUSON And , this afternoon , first chance I have , I 'll take him up to the O.R . and debride all that dead tissue . DR . WREN Good idea ! And he marches on down the corridor . DR . McCABE reaches the door . FERGUSON holds it open for him . McCABE returns FERGUSON 'S smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaches HOCHBERG . DR . MICHAELSON They 've been ringing you here , George . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Thanks , Mike ! To DR . HOCHBERG.Good morning , Doctor Hochberg . DR . LEO HOCHBERG Good morning , George . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON I was down in the record room this morning . He takes a pack of index-cards out of his pocket.The first forty-five cases seem to bear you out . DR . LEO HOCHBERG smiles:Uh , hm ! DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Some three hundred more charts to go through yet , but p. 8 DR . JOSH GORDON What 's this ? DR . LEO HOCHBERG Oh , Ferguson and I are doing a little research . I have some crazy notions about modern surgical technique . Ferguson , here , is writing a paper to prove that I 'm right ! DR . GEORGE FERGUSON As a matter of fact , Dr. Hochberg is writing the paper . I 'm just helping collect the data and arrange it . DR . LEO HOCHBERG Ah ! You 're doing all the hard work ! How 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , but her temperature 's down to normal now . DR . LEO HOCHBERG Good ! And Ward B  --  bed three ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Fine ! Asked for a drink of whiskey . DR . LEO HOCHBERG smiles:He 'll be all right . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON He is all right ! He grins.I gave him the drink . DR . LEO HOCHBERG laughs:Wo n't hurt him . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON becomes serious , turns to DR . GORDON:I wish you 'd have another look at 401 , Doctor . DR . JOSH GORDON Any worse today ? p. 9 DR . GEORGE FERGUSON I 'm afraid so . He 's putting up a fight , though . He may pull through . DR . JOSH GORDON shaking his head dubiously:Mm , I do n't know . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON I hope so . He 's a fine fellow . He 's planning great things for himself  --  when he gets out of here . DR . JOSH GORDON significantly : Whenhe gets out . The phone rings . A short intern crosses to phones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the way , George , we 're sending Mr. Hudson home Tuesday . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON suddenly excited:Tuesday ? Great ! Does Laura know , yet ? DR . LEO HOCHBERG nods:I phoned her this morning . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON She happy ? DR . LEO HOCHBERG Naturally ! DR . GEORGE FERGUSON I wish you had let me tell her . DR . LEO HOCHBERG twinkling:Ah  --  I should have thought of that ! DR . OTIS at phone:One second . Calls.Ferguson ! For you . p. 10 DR . LEO HOCHBERG Go on ! Call for you . FERGUSON goes to phone . HOCHBERG beams at GORDON.Good boy ! Lots of ability ! We 're going to be proud of him some day . Enter a lean , shabby man who at first glance appears out of place here . His coat is rusty , and rough weather has left its stain on the hat he carries so deferentially . Tucked under one arm is a large envelope of the type used for X-ray pictures . He has a timid , beaten manner . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his forehead and prematurely grayed his hair , making him seem years older . He hesitates at DR . HOCHBERG 'S elbow , and finally ventures to touch it . DR . LEO HOCHBERG turns , looks at him . Politely , as to a stranger:Yes ? Suddenly he recognizes the man.Why Levine ! He grips LEVINE 'S arms with both hands , almost in an embrace.My dear Levine ! I did n't recognize you . DR . LEVINE nods and smiles sadly:I know . DR . LEO HOCHBERG Dr. Gordon ! You remember Dr. Levine ? DR . JOSH GORDON hesitates a moment:Why , of course . They shake hands . p. 11 DR . LEO HOCHBERG Such a stranger ! Where have you been hiding all this time ? Why it must be five years since DR . LEVINE Six ! DR . LEO HOCHBERG Six ? My ! Mm To GORDON.We 're getting old . Then , affectionately.Ah ! It 's good to see you again . DR . LEVINE It 's nice to get back , but He looks around.Things here seem pretty much the same . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GORDON Nothing much changes in a hospital . DR . LEVINE Only people ! We change get old break up so quickly . The tragic quality in his voice affects the others . Pause . DR . JOSH GORDON Well To HOCHBERG.I 'm going up to look at that boy in 401 . HOCHBERG nods . GORDON turns to LEVINE.I 'm glad to have seen you again . Exit GORDON . DR . LEO HOCHBERG Tell me how are things with you ? DR . LEVINE Oh He shrugs his shoulders.Just about getting along . p. 12 DR . LEO HOCHBERG And how is Katherine ? DR . LEVINE his brow wrinkles:Not so well . DR . LEO HOCHBERG concerned:What seems to be the trouble ? DR . LEVINE Her lungs . She has a slight persistent cough ! Some X-rays here . He opens the large envelope he is carrying and from it takes two X-ray plates . HOCHBERG holds up the plates to the window and examines them . FERGUSON hangs up and returns to HOCHBERG . DR . LEO HOCHBERG holds the plates so that FERGUSON can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The right apex . DR . LEVINE Yes  --  I was afraid of DR . LEO HOCHBERG Now , do n't be an alarmist ! Sees something.Mm ! Squints at the plate , and asks , gravely.Have you examined the sputum ? Pause . DR . LEVINE I brought a specimen . He takes out a bottle , wrapped in paper , and explains apologetically:My microscope is broken . p. 13 DR . LEO HOCHBERG We 'll look at it here ! DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Certainly ! He takes the bottle.I 'll have the path lab check up on this . Is it anything important ? DR . LEVINE My wife . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Oh . DR . LEO HOCHBERG Er Dr. Ferguson , Dr. Levine !

GEORGE FERGUSON He thinks a great deal of you . DR . LEO HOCHBERG George , here , is one of his prize pupils , too . DR . LEVINE And does he want you to study abroad ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Yes . I planned to go with Sauerbruch , but he has been forced to leave Germany . So , instead of that , I 'm going to study under von Eiselsberg in Vienna . DR . LEO HOCHBERG Hm ! I remember when I was a student in Berlin , one of my classmates came to an examination in military uniform sabre and all . Virchow looked at him , and said , " You !

We 'll go down to X-ray and read these pictures properly . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON holds up bottle:And do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you . Exit HOCHBERG . LEVINE turns to FERGUSON.Remember , there 's only one Hochberg . Every minute with him is precious . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON I wo n't miss a second of it . LEVINE goes . FERGUSON crosses to a long table at which MICHAELSON and SHORTY are seated . DR . MICHAELSON who has been watching LEVINE and FERGUSON:He 's telling you , huh ? FERGUSON nods , smiles , and looks for a particular book in the shelves.Say , there 's a damned interesting article on Hochberg in this week 's A.M.A. p. 16 DR . GEORGE FERGUSON I know . He finds the magazine and hands it over to SHORTY , a small , chubby , good-natured , irresponsible , wise-cracking fellow , who takes life in his stride.Here it is . You want to read this , Shorty . SHORTY sits down to read it . DR . MICHAELSON Yep . I wish I could get in with him for a year . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON to SHORTY:What do you think of that first case ? The way he handled it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PETE BRADLEY intern , a tall , gawky lad , slow-moving and casual about everything but food , enters , fixing his stethoscope .

OTIS Will you lend me your white tux vest for tonight ? I 've got DR . PETE BRADLEY abruptly:The answer is still no . He turns to FERGUSON.That little  --  DR . OTIS sits down again:Thanks ! p. 17 DR . PETE BRADLEY You 're welcome . To FERGUSON again.The little girl we just operated on is coming out of her ether nicely . I was kind of worried about that preop insulin . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Why ? How much did you give her ? DR . PETE BRADLEY Forty units . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Twenty would have been enough . DR . PETE BRADLEY I know . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Then why the hell did you give her forty ? You might have hurt the kid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . OTIS That dope  --  Cunningham ! DR . GEORGE FERGUSON You should have told me before you gave it to her . I 'm not going to have any patients go into shock on the operating table ! Understand ? DR . PETE BRADLEY O.K. DR . GEORGE FERGUSON good-naturedly , slapping PETE on the head with a pamphlet:If this happens again , Pete , you get your behind kicked in and not by Cunningham ! DR . PETE BRADLEY O.K. NURSE JAMISON passing by , carrying a tray of medication , halts in the door-way , looks in and calls:Oh , Doctor Ferguson , that drink worked wonders . Bed three is sitting up and taking notice . p. 18 DR . GEORGE FERGUSON laughs:A new school of therapy ! DR . OTIS Say , Jamison , you 're not looking so hot . You ought to stay home one night and get some sleep . NURSE JAMISON Oh , I 'm doing all right . She laughs and goes . DR . OTIS Yeah ? I 'll bet you are .

He starts for phone.But when it began to interfere with my appetite Hell ! No woman 's worth that ! They laugh . p. 19 DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Thing I like about you , Pete , is your romantic nature .

JOSH GORDON I 'm afraid not  --  the superficial veins are all thrombosed . Ferguson has followed the case from the start ; he knows the veins we 've used . p. 21 DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Laidlaw knows the veins . DR . JOSH GORDON Frankly , I do n't trust any of the other men on this case . I know I 'm imposing , but I want this boy to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ferguson . What do you say ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON All right ! I 'll stay . DR . JOSH GORDON Thanks ! He starts to go  --  turns back.And if your sweetheart kicks up a fuss , send her around to me . I 'll tell her about my wife . Up at 4:30 this morning to answer the phone . Somebody had a bellyache . He laughs , nods and goes . FERGUSON remains , dejected . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Damn it ! I wanted to be with Laura tonight . DR . MICHAELSON That 's tough , George . I 'm sorry I could n't help you out . The loudspeaker starts calling : " Dr. Manning ! Dr. Manning ! " DR . GEORGE FERGUSON rises and walks about:Laura 's going to be hurt . You 'd think they 'd have a little NURSE JAMISON comes quickly down the corridor , looks in , and calls , a bit , breathless:Dr . Ferguson ? She sees him.Dr .

The loudspeaker , which has been calling , " Dr. Manning ! " changes to a louder and more persistent , " Dr. Hochberg ! Dr. Hochberg , Dr. Hochberg ! " Well , try the X-ray room ! And locate the staff anesthetist ! In the back corridor we catch a glimpse of an orderly hurriedly pushing a rolling stretcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An intern on one side and the nurse at the other are holding pads to her throat and trying to calm her . FADE OUT p. 23 Act 1 , Scene 2 ACT ONE : Scene 2 The largest and the most expensive private room in the hospital . It is luxuriously furnished in the best of taste and tries hard to drive all clinical atmosphere out into the corridor . What the room ca n't eliminate , it attempts to disguise ; not , however , with complete success . For there , behind a large , flowered screen , the foot of a hospital " gatch " bed peeps out , and in the corner we see a table with bottles of medication on it . MR . HUDSON , a large man , haunched , paunched , and jowled , clad in pajamas and a lounging robe , is sitting up on a divan being shaved by the HOSPITAL BARBER . He is talking to one of his business associates , a MR . MOONEY , who is a smaller , nattier , less impressive , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JOHN HUDSON through a face full of lather:We 'll get that property , Mooney ! And we 'll get it now on our own terms . JAMES MOONEY marching impatiently to and fro:How are you going to break that Clinton Street boom ? JOHN HUDSON You get in touch with the real estate editor of every paper in town . Tell them we 've decided to change the location of Hudson City from Clinton to say Third Street . Map out a territory ! Make it convincing ! A nurse enters with a bowl of flowers , places it on a small table , arranges the flowers , and departs . p. 24 JAMES MOONEY hesitantly:Think they 'll believe it ? JOHN HUDSON Sure . Got a cigar ? JAMES MOONEY produces one , then hesitates:You 're not supposed to smoke , you know . JOHN HUDSON I 'm all right ! Ca n't think without a cigar ! He takes it . The BARBER gives him a light . He puffs once or twice with huge relish.Start negotiations with every realty owner in the new territory . Buy options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts to powder HUDSON 'S face , but is waved away . JAMES MOONEY Oh yes . JOHN HUDSON In the meantime sell ten of our houses on Clinton Street  --  including corners . Sell low ! JAMES MOONEY Hey ! We want that stuff ! JOHN HUDSON Get Henderson ! Form two dummy corporations  --  and sell to them . JAMES MOONEY Oh ! Yes , I think it 'll work that ought to bring down those prices . The BARBER packs his shaving kit and exits . JOHN HUDSON We 'll wait till they 're ready to take nickels then our dummy corporations can grab all that property . Mooney , we 'll be excavating this Spring , yet . Enter DR . HOCHBERG . He sees HUDSON smoking , frowns , goes to him , takes the cigar out of his mouth , and throws it away . p. 25 DR . LEO HOCHBERG Did n't Dr. Whitman say no more cigars ? JOHN HUDSON startled , his first impulse one of extreme annoyance:Hochberg , please . He controls himself , turns to MOONEY . JAMES MOONEY glances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be going now . JOHN HUDSON helps him into his coat:Phone me ! JAMES MOONEY I will . Do n't worry ! Shakes HUDSON 'S hand.Take care of yourself ! To Hochberg.Goodbye , Doctor ! HOCHBERG nods . Exit MOONEY . HOCHBERG watches MOONEY go , then turns to HUDSON and shakes his head . JOHN HUDSON Whitman 's sending me home Tuesday , is n't he ? What do you want to do ? Make an invalid of me ? He goes to the phone.Operator ! Get me Vanderbilt 2-34  --  He gasps , an expression of pain crosses his face , his free hand goes to his breast . DR . LEO HOCHBERG nods grimly:Uh , huh ! HUDSON glances at HOCHBERG guiltily , controls himself , continues on the phone . p. 26 JOHN HUDSON 3471 ! DR . LEO HOCHBERG goes to him , takes the phone out of his hand , puts it down , with an abrupt nod of the head toward the bed:You better lie down ! JOHN HUDSON It 's nothing . Just a DR . LEO HOCHBERG softly:I know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself at HOCHBERG 'S persistence . Then he goes to the bed and lies down . HOCHBERG feels his pulse . JOHN HUDSON I tell you , I 'm all right ! DR . LEO HOCHBERG I do n't understand people like you , John . Whitman is the best cardiac man in the country , but he ca n't give you a new heart ! Do n't you know that ? Are you such a fool ? Enter LAURA , a spirited , chic young lady ; lithe , fresh , quick , modern , a trifle spoiled perhaps , but withal eminently warm , lovable , and human . LAURA HUDSON What 's he done now , Hocky ? JOHN HUDSON Hello , honey ! DR . LEO HOCHBERG Laura ! LAURA HUDSON kissing HUDSON:How 's my dad , today ? p. 27 JOHN HUDSON I 'm fine , dear , just fine .

LAURA HUDSON I know , dear , and that 's great ! But it is n't going to do any good if you act this way . Ca n't you forget the office ? Close it up ! I mean that . DR . LEO HOCHBERG She 's right , John  --  absolutely . LAURA HUDSON What good is your money , damn it ! if you ca n't enjoy it ? JOHN HUDSON Well , it can still buy my little girl a honeymoon . LAURA HUDSON I could spend my honeymoon right here ! And have a swell time . As long as it 's with George . To HOCHBERG.Where is that man ? p. 28 DR . LEO HOCHBERG Upstairs  --  busy ! LAURA HUDSON Oh ! To her father.So , are you going to behave yourself , Dad ? JOHN HUDSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm all right . I 'll live . Deliberately changing the subject.How was Doris 's party last night ? LAURA HUDSON Noisy . JOHN HUDSON Not much fun , eh ? LAURA HUDSON Not much . JOHN HUDSON Too bad George could n't be there . LAURA HUDSON I spent most of the time upstairs with Doris 's baby . It woke and wanted some attention . Babies are awfully human that way , are n't they ? Do you know that Doris was going to let him cry himself to sleep ? Can you imagine ? ! Believe me , when I have my baby , it 's going to get all the care and love and attention it can use . DR . LEO HOCHBERG chuckles:You have the right instincts , Laura . LAURA HUDSON Have I ? Rises.I have n't had a real kiss in days . Can I get George on the phone , Hocky ? p. 29 DR . LEO HOCHBERG He 'll be down soon . LAURA HUDSON goes to phone:I want to see that man ! She picks up the phone . DR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a bit resentfully.He 's in the operating room .

JOHN HUDSON But this is on my mind . DR . LEO HOCHBERG Again ? John , you 're a madman ! LAURA HUDSON quickly , with a tinge of bitterness:And he 's not the only one , Dr. Hochberg . JOHN HUDSON looks up at her quizzically , sees what 's eating her , then turns to HOCHBERG:God , they make a slave of that boy . And he does n't get a dime ! I ca n't see it . DR .

BLACK OUT p. 42 Act 1 , Scene 3 ACT ONE : Scene 3 A bed , screened off from the others , in a corner of the children 's ward . The entire wall , separating ward from corridor , is framed in glass panels , so that the nurse on duty out there can always keep a watchful eye over the youngsters .

She 's so pale ! MR . SMITH Where 's Cunningham ? Why is n't he here ? To BARBARA.Miss Dennin ! Ca n't you do something ? BARBARA DENNIN Dr. Ferguson will be right here , sir ! Enter DR . CUNNINGHAM , a dignified , impressive-looking gentleman , immaculately attired , goatee , pince-nez , throaty voice  --  just a bit too much of the " professional manner , " arrived at in this instance by a certain false philosophy which one occasionally finds in the profession . CUNNINGHAM believes that nine patients out of ten will be cured by nature anyway , and the tenth will die no matter what the physician does for him . This system of logic concludes that impressing the patient and assuaging his fears are more important than keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sad part of it is that CUNNINGHAM is a successful practitioner  --  successful , that is , in terms of bank account . True , most of his colleagues look down on him with scorn , but he has a magnificent Park Avenue office , with all the impressive equipment , wealthy patients , and political influence  --  which , although he is not a member of the staff , has gained him the " courtesy " of the hospital  --  meaning that he may bring his patients here for hospitalization. p. 43 BARBARA DENNIN Dr. Cunningham !

At once forty units with fifty grams of glucose . BARBARA DENNIN But , sir , Dr. Ferguson advised against insulin . DR . CUNNINGHAM Ferguson ? You please take your orders from me forty units !

GEORGE FERGUSON I beg your pardon , Doctor , but is n't insulin contraindicated here ? DR . CUNNINGHAM No . It 's our last chance . FERGUSON bites his lips to restrain himself . CUNNINGHAM takes the hypo from BARBARA and presses out the air bubbles . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Doctor , I mean no offense , but I 've studied this case history , and it looks like shock not coma ! DR . CUNNINGHAM pauses  --  looks at the patient , shakes his head:No no . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON But , the clinical picture is so clear-cut . Look at the patient ! She 's pale , cold , clammy , temperature subnormal . She 's complained of hunger ! Sudden onset ! DR . CUNNINGHAM angrily:Suppose you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BARBARA.Prepare that arm ! BARBARA swabs the arm . CUNNINGHAM leans over the patient . FERGUSON hesitates a moment , then goes to CUNNINGHAM , puts his hand on CUNNINGHAM 'S arm . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Please , Doctor ! Call in one of the other men ! Ask them ! Anybody ! DR . CUNNINGHAM There 's no time ! Take your hand off ! p. 46 DR . GEORGE FERGUSON That insulin 's going to prove fatal . DR . CUNNINGHAM wavers a moment , uncertain , hesitant , then he turns on FERGUSON:Get out of here , will you ? I do n't want any interruption while I 'm treating my patient ! He shakes FERGUSON 'S arm off . Bends to administer the hypo , hesitates a moment , then straightens up confused and worried . FERGUSON , with sudden resolve , takes the hypo from CUNNINGHAM 'S fingers and squirts out the insulin.Here ! What are you Why did you do that , you fool ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON ignores him , turns to BARBARA , his voice crisp and cool:Shock position ! BARBARA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratchet that elevates the foot of the bed .

On the bureau is a small radio  --  the one luxury in the room . On the walls are two framed diplomas  --  the sole decorations . The room is untidy  --  as all interns ' rooms are ; the bed is messed , it being customary for interns to use it as a lounge ; the books are piled irregularly on the bookshelves , on the desk , on the bureau , and on the floor . A moonlit night filters in through a single square window . FERGUSON , wearing spectacles , is at his desk , reading , by the light of a desk lamp , a ponderous medical tome . Occasionally he jots down a note . A knock at the door . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON without looking up , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt , collar , white vest . DR . OTIS triumphantly:Well , I got the vest .

Well , take off my vest before you start . I do n't want any stains on it . He returns to the desk and points to the chocolate.Now can I have some of that myself ! He reaches over and breaks off a piece of chocolate . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON smiles:Who was the first piece for ? DR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He holds up the chocolate.This is for me . Pops it into his mouth . FERGUSON laughs a tired laugh , and hands him the rest of the large bar , anxious to get rid of him . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Here , take it all , Pete ! DR . PETE BRADLEY Thanks ! What a lousy dinner we had tonight ! Fish ! Oh , how I hate fish ! p. 59 DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Friday night . DR . PETE BRADLEY Yeah ! Say ! What are you doing in ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON 401 may need a transfusion . DR . PETE BRADLEY A lot of good that 'll do him ! Stuffs his mouth with chocolate.For Christ 's sake he passed out . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON No ? DR . PETE BRADLEY About ten minutes ago . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON slowly:Gee , that 's too bad ! DR . PETE BRADLEY jamming in a huge chunk of chocolate:Yeah ! Say , I 'm hungry . I 'm going to run out to Fleischer 's and grab a sandwich . Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON All right ! Hurry it , will you ? I may be going out myself . DR . PETE BRADLEY Be right back ! Exits . FERGUSON sits there a moment , staring blankly at the wall . Finally he sighs , wearily closes the book , pushes it away , takes off his spectacles , puts them in a case , and reaches for the phone . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Outside wire , please ! Atwater 9-0032 . Yes . Hello ! Hello ! Is Miss Hudson there ? Dr. Ferguson calling . Yes . Hello , Laura ! How are you dear ? Feeling better ? Oh ! Well , look dear , I can make it tonight , after all . What ? Oh , do n't be silly ! But darling we 'll work that out ! We 'll find some It 's so far away , yet . Why talk about ? Listen , Laura ! That chance to work with Hochberg is one of the best breaks I 've ever had ! You do n't expect me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's notice , simply because you have some crazy idea that No , no ! I do n't want to even talk about it , tonight . I 'm tired , Laura . It 's been a hell of a day ! Three operations and I ca n't think ! I ca n't make an important decision tonight in a minute ! Oh , Laura ! What the hell are you doing ? Punishing me ? All right , Laura . A knock at the door.All right . I 'll see you tomorrow night ! Yes yes goodbye ! He hangs up , somewhat sharply , then wearily goes to the door , opens it . DR . LEVINE is standing there . p. 60 DR . LEVINE I 'm sorry if I DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Oh , no ! Come on in , Dr. Levine ! DR . LEVINE , murmurs a hardly audible thanks and enters . He looks about , touches the desk , smiles , nods , and murmurs almost to himself:Yes . Yes it certainly is nice ! Six years like yesterday . Looks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FERGUSON I 'll see . Takes phone . DR . LEVINE Oh , do n't trouble ! DR . GEORGE FERGUSON That 's Into phone.Hello ! Path lab , please ! To DR . LEVINE.What did Dr. Hochberg find ? DR . LEVINE He left it for the X-ray man to read . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON into phone: Hello ! Dr. Finn ? Ferguson ! What about that sputum ? Oh ! To DR . LEVINE.Under the microscope , now . Into phone.Fine ! Hurry that through , will you ? And send it down to my room ! Yes . Thanks ! He hangs up.A few minutes I hope it 's nothing . p. 61 DR . LEVINE nods:Poor Katherine ! She 's had so much . Things were so different when I was here before I married . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Yes Professor Dury told me . DR . LEVINE Dury ? I know just what he says : Levine  --  the fool !  --  wealthy mother  --  chance to work with Hochberg  --  to be somebody . Threw it all away for a pretty face . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Your mother ? Has n't she ? DR . LEVINE shakes his head.Not yet ? Well , she 'll come around to your way . DR . LEVINE shakes his head again:No . When I married Katherine , a gentile , and my mother disowned me it must have broken her heart . But still , she was doing the right thing from her point of view . He sighs.Poor Katherine ! I did n't count on that ! East side ! Tenements ! Fifty-cent patients ! Poverty ! Dirt ! Struggle ! He shakes his head. I do n't know . Maybe it would have been better for her the other way maybe . He smiles sadly at FERGUSON.Burnt offerings ! Jehovah and Aesculapius ! They both demand their human sacrifice . Pauses.Medicine ! Why do we kill ourselves for it ? p. 62 DR . GEORGE FERGUSON I do n't know . I often wonder , myself , whether it was worth the grind of working my way through college and med school . DR . LEVINE Med school , too ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you kept up with classes . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON I managed . DR . LEVINE Terrific grind ! DR . GEORGE FERGUSON It was n't much fun but , still I guess it 's the only thing I really want to do . Pause.My dad used to say , " Above all is humanity ! " He was a fine man  --  my dad . A small-town physician  --  upstate . When I was about thirteen , he came to my room one night and apologized because he was going to die . His heart had gone bad on him . He knew if he gave up medicine and took it easy he could live for twenty years . But he wanted to go right on , wanted to die in harness . And he did . Pause.Above all else is humanity  --  that 's a big thought . So big that alongside of it you and I do n't really matter very much . That 's why we do it , I guess . DR . LEVINE You 're right , of course ! Ah it 's not good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A doctor should n't have to worry about money ! That 's one disease he 's not trained to fight . It either corrupts him or it destroys him . He sighs.Well maybe someday the State will take over Medicine . p. 63 DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Before we let the State control medicine , we 'd have to put every politician on the operating table , and cut out his acquisitive instincts . DR . LEVINE laughs:That , I 'm afraid , would be a major operation ! DR . GEORGE FERGUSON smiles:Yes . Then he becomes serious again , working himself up , thinking of LAURA.But , it is a danger ! We ca n't allow outside forces , or things or people to interfere with us . We ca n't ! And , if they do , we 've got to bar them out even if we have to tear out our hearts to do it . LEVINE looks puzzled . He ca n't quite follow this . FERGUSON suddenly realizes the personal turn his thoughts have taken , sees LEVINE 'S bewilderment , and stops short . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess that 's a bit off the track just something personal . DR . LEVINE smiles:Oh ! Yes . A knock at the door . FERGUSON goes to the door . An orderly is there . ORDERLY Dr. Ferguson ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Yes ? ORDERLY Dr. Finn sent this down ! He hands FERGUSON a printed report . p. 64 DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Oh , yes , thanks ! Orderly goes . FERGUSON is about to hand it to LEVINE.Doctor FERGUSON glances at it and suddenly stiffens.One second ! DR . LEVINE suddenly becomes tense , too:Dr . Ferguson ! Is that ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON in a strained , brittle voice:Wait ! He goes to the phone.Path lab ! DR . LEVINE Is that for me ? FERGUSON does n't answer him . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Path lab ? Dr. Finn Ferguson ! That report you just sent me are you positive ? Make sure ! Look again . DR . LEVINE Is that the finding on my ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON over the phone:Yes . Yes . Clear as that ? Slowly.I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns to LEVINE , hands him the card in silence . DR . LEVINE takes it , reads it . He droops . His fingers tremble , the card falls to the ground . After a moment 's silence he wets his lips and murmurs , almost inaudibly:I knew it . I knew it . p. 65 DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Gee , I wish I could tell you how sorry I DR . LEVINE Tuberculosis ! Oh , my poor Katherine ! He sits down on the bed and stares vacantly ahead.What are we going to do , now ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON goes to the bed , sits down next to him , tenderly puts a hand on his shoulder:She 'll come through all right ! You 'll see . A silence . DR . LEVINE pulls himself together.Perhaps if you took her to a drier climate DR . LEVINE Maybe maybe ! He rises.That means giving up the little practice I have means starting all over again . I do n't know if we can do it . We 're not young , any longer . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Is there anything I can do ? DR . LEVINE No , thanks ! Thanks ! Exit DR . LEVINE . FERGUSON stands there a moment , staring after him . Enter PETE . DR . PETE BRADLEY sucking his teeth with great gusto:Boy , what a roast-beef sandwich I had ! Mm ! He sucks his teeth louder.Have you got a oh , yeah ! He reaches over and takes a tongue-depressor out of FERGUSON 'S breast pocket . PETE splits the depressor and , using one of the splinters as a tooth-pick , continues to make an even greater noise with his lips . FERGUSON , pretty near the cracking point , turns his back on PETE . PETE goes to the radio , and tunes in on a loud jazz number . He flops down onto the bed  --  sucks his teeth.Going out ? p. 66 DR . GEORGE FERGUSON No ! DR . PETE BRADLEY Change your mind ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Yes . DR . PETE BRADLEY Boy , you know that Miss Simpson down in the X-ray lab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mine . Say  --  she 's swell all dressed up in street clothes . I looked at her for ten minutes without recognizing her . I guess maybe it was because I was n't looking at her face . Sucks his teeth.Luscious ! She had one of those tight black silk dresses absolutely nothing else on underneath  --  you could see that . And a pair of mammaries ! Mm ! DR . GEORGE FERGUSON tensely:Pete ! I want to do some reading . Will you get the hell out ? DR . PETE BRADLEY sits up , looks at FERGUSON , rises quickly:Sure ! With a puzzled , backward glance at FERGUSON , he goes . FERGUSON switches off the radio , walks up and down the room , almost frantic , then throws himself face down on the bed . There is a timid little knock at the door . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Come in ! The knock is repeated . FERGUSON rises , calling impatiently.Come in . Come in ! BARBARA opens the door and slips in , breathless with the adventure.What er ? p. 67 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GEORGE FERGUSON Oh ! Of course . I forgot stupid of me . Let 's see  --  what was it ? Materia Medica ? BARBARA DENNIN Yes . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON looks through drawer in his desk:I had them here someplace . BARBARA DENNIN I suppose I ought n't to have come in . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON sorting notes:Pathology , Histology  --  no  --  no . BARBARA DENNIN I hope nobody saw me . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Materia Medica . Here ! He takes a notebook out of the drawer , glances through it , hands it to her.There you are ! BARBARA DENNIN Thanks ! DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Not at all ! Hope they 're some help . He goes to the window , looks out  --  dismissing her . Still in his old mood . BARBARA DENNIN stands there a moment , waiting . Finally , she asks timidly:Is there anything wrong ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON What ? p. 68 BARBARA DENNIN Anything wrong ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Oh ! No ! No ! He turns to the window again . BARBARA hesitates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the intensity of his mood . She slowly turns , opens the door , looks out , and suddenly shuts it with an exclamation of fright.What  --  BARBARA DENNIN breathless frightened:Head nurse ! Outside ! DR . GEORGE FERGUSON See you ? Wait a minute ! She 'll be gone ! Better sit down ! BARBARA DENNIN Thanks ! She watches him a moment.Are you sure Dr. Cunningham did n't  --  FERGUSON shakes his head.Because if it would mean anything I 'd go right down and tell them all  --  everybody  --  just what happened . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON No , it 's not Cunningham  --  BARBARA DENNIN What is it , then ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON It 's just  --  With an effort he shakes off his mood.Do n't mind me tonight . BARBARA DENNIN You work very hard , do n't you ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON almost savagely:Work ? Sure ! What else is there but work  --  and work ! He suddenly realizes BARBARA is staring at him . He pulls himself together.Let 's see those notes ! She brings them to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and turns the pages.There ! BARBARA is next to him , leaning over the notes , her head near his.These pages synopsize the whole business . Read through the notes carefully ; memorize these pages  --  and you 've got it ! I think you 'll find it lots easier that way . p. 69 BARBARA DENNIN pointing to a word:What 's this ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Calomel ! BARBARA DENNIN her head almost touching his:Oh , of course ! It 's a C. DR . GEORGE FERGUSON hands her the book:Clear ? BARBARA DENNIN Yes . As she reaches for the book , her hand meets his , and she clings to it.You know , when I thought Dots was going to die I got the feeling like I I God ! I ca n't put it into words ! DR . GEORGE FERGUSON I know . I know that feeling . BARBARA DENNIN You , too ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Me , too ? Clutching his throat.Up to here , Barbara ! Right now ! Christ ! I 'm tired of work , and blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dead ! And Levine 's wife is going to die and one begins to wonder where in Heaven 's God , and what in Hell 's it all about , and why on earth does anything make any difference . BARBARA DENNIN clutches his arm with her hand:Yes , that 's the feeling and you get so lonely and you feel tomorrow it 's me and the only thing that matters is just being alive just being alive . Now ! Is n't it ? She is very close to GEORGE now , clutching his arm with her hand . p. 70 DR . GEORGE FERGUSON looks at her sympathetically:You kids have a pretty tough time of it , do n't you ? Grind all day and lights out at ten o'clock . BARBARA DENNIN And only one night out till twelve-thirty and I have n't taken mine in two months . There 's just nobody They are very close , now . She almost whispers the last words to him . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON You 're a sweet girl , Barbara . Suddenly he takes her in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment . Then they separate . He is confused and upset.I 'm sorry , Barbara I He goes to the notes , opens them  --  after a pause.These diagrams here go with this page . Aside from that , I guess they 'll be pretty clear . He gives the book to her grips her shoulder.Please do n't feel that I just BARBARA DENNIN Oh ! No ! No ! DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Thanks . Goes to the door opens it looks out. I 'm going up to Ward C , to look around for a few seconds . The coast is clear  --  you 'd better go now . Exit FERGUSON . BARBARA takes up the notes walks slowly to the door hesitates there a moment is about to go out , suddenly stops decides to stay . For a moment she leans against the door , breathless , then she goes back into the room , slowly drops the notes on the table , goes to the bed , sits down , takes off her cap , throws it on the bed , and sits there waiting. @x @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main feature of which is a long table . Seated about it are the members of the Joint Committee  --  three laymen representing the Lay Board , and four doctors representing the Medical Board . Beyond them , we see mahogany panels , a huge fireplace and an oil portrait hanging over it , dark plush portieres drawn to conceal windows and doors  --  in effect , a rich boardroom of the same general conspiratorial appearance as the board-room of a railroad , a steel , oil , banking , or other big business institution . At rise : MR . HOUGHTON , short , stodgy , aggressive the economist , has just finished reading a report . MR . HOUGHTON 28,000  --  19,000  --  33,500 , which adds up to a total deficit of 163,000 dollars so far , doctors . He shakes his head.You 'll have to cut down those expenses , doctors . DR . JOSH GORDON How ? DR . WREN We 're to the bone , already . We 've cut  --  MR . SPENCER presiding , gray-templed , sure , suave , six generations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wren ! p. 73 DR . WREN rises:Everything  --  our staff , nurses , technicians , salaries , meals  --  telephones even ! Our interns are allowed only two outside calls . DR . LEO HOCHBERG An absurd economy ! MR . HOUGHTON taking some papers out of his briefcase:Mm ! It seems to me we 've a lot of people in our laboratories . Could n't we reduce  --  DR . LEO HOCHBERG No , no  --  To the chairman.Mr . Spencer ! MR . SPENCER giving HOCHBERG the floor:Dr . Hochberg . DR . LEO HOCHBERG rises , and explains , very patiently:Those laboratories , Mr. Houghton , arethe hospital . Most of our real work is done in them . He smiles and shakes his head.Without that pathology lab and the chemistry lab and the X-ray lab we 're helpless . MR . RUMMOND rather old and dim-witted , trying very hard to be a constructive part of this business , but not quite able to grasp it:You are ? Really ? DR . LEO HOCHBERG Absolutely . p. 74 MR . RUMMOND Hm . Interesting . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LEO HOCHBERG Oh , yes . DR . JOSH GORDON I should say so . MR . HOUGHTON Well , then . He looks at his papers , and shakes his head. I do n't know . 163,000 dollars  --  these days ! The Board of Trustees is  --  MR . SPENCER Er we 'll come back to that later , Mr. Houghton . I want to clear away all er Dr. Gordon ! Any reports from the Medical Board to this joint committee ? DR . JOSH GORDON Appointments ! Two-year internships , gentlemen  --  recommended on the basis of competitive examinations . Starts looking through some papers for the list.Interns . Ah , yes . Finds his list and reads from it.Aubert , Dickinson , Flickers , Frankey , Gordon , Kern , Monroe ! The Medical Board awaits your approval of these men . MR . HOUGHTON quickly:Where 's Ten Eyck ? MR . SPENCER You still ca n't do anything for Ten Eyck ? DR . JOSH GORDON Ten Eyck ? He glances over his lists , murmuring.Ten Eyck , Ten Eyck , Ten Eyck . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ten Eyck finished fourth from the bottom  --  on a list of three hundred men examined . p. 75 MR . HOUGHTON Senator Ten Eyck 's going to be sore as hell . DR . LARROW pompous pedant , cut pretty much from the same pattern as DR . CUNNINGHAM:I met the boy . Seems well-bred . Good family . DR . WREN He does n't knowanything . I gave him his oral in medicine . An ignoramus . DR . LARROW Examinations ! Bah ! He graduated at an approved medical school , did n't he ? DR . WREN TogetherHow he managed it is a mystery to me . DR . JOSH GORDON TogetherWe gave him special consideration , Mr. Spencer . But he just wo n't do . MR . SPENCER Well  --  his uncle 's kicking up a fuss , but if the boy 's that bad . After all , you know best . The appointments are in your hands . Which brings me to the real purpose of this special meeting . He organizes his papers , clears his throat , and looks at them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the bad news . DR . WREN We usually run up a much larger deficit . MR . SPENCER smiles at this naivet , so typical of the doctor in business:Yes but these are unusual times , Doctor . As you , no doubt , have heard , there has been a depression . p. 76 DR . JOSH GORDON Hasbeen ? I like that . You try and collect some of my bills . DR . LARROW Yes . People are too poor to get sick these days . DR . LEO HOCHBERG That 's something no matter how poor a man is he can always get  --  sick ! GORDON and WREN enjoy a laugh at LARROW 'S discomfiture . MR . SPENCER Er Doctors ! Please ! This is a very important matter ! They quiet down , and lean forward . There is no escaping the note of impending ill news in SPENCER 'S manner.Two of our Trustees are very shaky , and may not be able to meet their usual subscription at all . They 've already spoken to me about resigning . The doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been looking around carefully for a new Trustee  --  and believe me , doctors , it was a mighty hard search . But , finally  --  He smiles .  --  I found someone to underwrite our deficit . Sighs of relief and approval from the doctors.A man well known for his philanthropies , his generous soul , his civic and social services  --  John Hudson  --  the real estate Hudson . HOCHBERG grunts.A friend of yours , I believe , Doctor ! p. 77 DR . LEO HOCHBERG Yes . But I did n't recognize him by the description . MR . SPENCER laughs.He 'll be useful . The only real estate man I heard of who 's made money the last few years . Good business head . He 'll put St. George 's on a paying basis . MR . SPENCER laughs:If he can do that , he 's a wizard . Mr. Houghton will resign in favor of him tomorrow . MR . HOUGHTON With pleasure . MR . SPENCER I 've talked the matter over with him , and he 's definitely interested . Chorus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can get him to subscribe for MR . SPENCER Mr. Houghton ! Please ! MR . HOUGHTON Sorry ! MR . SPENCER Now , it happens that one of our interns is marrying John Hudson 's daughter  --  in a few weeks , I believe . Of course , Doctors , appointments lie completely in your hands , but we feel here is an opportunity . We suggest the Medical Board offer Dr. Ferguson an associateship . DR . LEO HOCHBERG What ? Impossible ! MR . SPENCER Impossible ? A serious student , capable , going to study a year abroad under a well-known man  --  why impossible ? p. 78 DR . LEO HOCHBERG He wo n't be ready for the job ! MR . SPENCER Have you any personal prejudice against the boy ? DR . LEO HOCHBERG annoyed:No no ! He rises.As a matter of fact , I 'm very fond of that boy . I think he has promise of becoming a good surgeon , someday . But not overnight . He has years of intensive study ahead of him . I do n't care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will not work for something he can get for nothing  --  and Ferguson 's no exception . An associateship here now simply means he 'll go into practice and drop his studies . DR . LARROW And why should n't he ? He 's marrying well . With his wife 's connections , he ought to er do very nicely . DR . LEO HOCHBERG If he does n't continue his studies , he 'll never be worth a damn as far as medicine goes . MR . SPENCER After all , Dr. Hochberg , that 's his concern , not ours . DR . LARROW TogetherOh ! Dubiously.He 's all right . But  --  with conviction .  --  he 's no infant Cushing by any means . p. 79 MR . SPENCER TogetherWe must think of the hospital , Doctors ! That 's our job . DR . LEO HOCHBERG losing his temper . To DR . LARROW:You 're wrong , Doctor . That boy has unusual ability . Yes , yes  --  another Cushing , perhaps ! Controls himself  --  to MR . SPENCER quietly.Exactly , Mr. Spencer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precious human life that lies in an associate 's hands ? Ferguson does n't know enough , yet ; he 's apt to make mistakes that will hurt not only himself , but the integrity of St. George 's Hospital . MR . SPENCER Oh , come now , Dr. Hochberg ! MR . HOUGHTON Oh , for Christ 's sake . Together MR . RUMMOND Nothing to be thrown away so lightly ! Together MR . SPENCER What do you think , Dr. Wren ? DR . WREN slowly:Well he wo n't be ready for it , of course , but  --  er  --  we could see to it that he 'd always be covered by an older man ! DR . LEO HOCHBERG And give him nothing to do ! Make a figurehead of him . Fine ! That 's fine ! p. 80 MR . HOUGHTON What of it ? DR . JOSH GORDON Of course , we do n't exactly approve of the appointment , however MR . HOUGHTON exploding:Approve ! Approve ! MR . SPENCER irritably:Mr . Houghton ! Please ! HOUGHTON subsides with a grunt.Dr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , we do n't exactly approve the appointment for such a young man ; however , we do need Hudson . And Ferguson 's not a fool , by any means . MR . SPENCER Exactly , Dr. Gordon . DR . LEO HOCHBERG But , Josh , do n't you see  --  ? DR . JOSH GORDON Leo , we 've got to face the facts . There 's hardly a hospital in this city that has n't shut down on its charity wards . I know a dozen that have completely closed off entire floors and wings ! If we have to economize any more , our wealthy patients will take care of themselves , but who 's going to take care of all your charity cases ? The wards upstairs are full , right now . MR . HOUGHTON It takes money to run a hospital , Doctor ! Together DR . LEO HOCHBERG to GORDON:You 're right , Josh you 're To HOUGHTON.I know , Mr. Houghton , I know . TogetherAnd , believe me , we 're deeply grateful to you gentlemen for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Together MR . SPENCER I only wish I could subscribe more , Doctor ! I would . Together DR . LEO HOCHBERG Yes . Deeply grateful . Although it 's a social crime , gentlemen , that hospitals should depend on the charity of a few individuals . The trustees look at each other , not quite sure whether they 've been attacked or flattered . DR . LARROW The fact remains that we ca n't afford to refuse Hudson 's help . DR . LEO HOCHBERG I do n't say that . DR . LARROW We need him . DR . LEO HOCHBERG We do . And till hospitals are subsidized by the community and run by men in medicine , we 'll continue to need our wealthy friends . I realize that . I say by all means make Hudson a Trustee . Take all the help he can give . And promise Ferguson an associateship as soon as he 's readyto go into practice . MR . SPENCER And that 'll be  --  when ? DR . LEO HOCHBERG In five or six years . MR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing with a businessman there , not a child ! Together p. 82 MR . RUMMOND You ca n't expect the man to  --  Together MR . SPENCER smiling wryly:I 'm very much afraid Hudson will tell us to come around ourselves in five or six years . Together DR . LEO HOCHBERG to SPENCER:How do you know ? MR . SPENCER He wants the boy to open an office and settle down . DR . LEO HOCHBERG He does ? That 's nice . Well , Ferguson wo n't be ready . MR . SPENCER If we do n't appoint the boy we ca n't expect Hudson to be interested . DR . WREN There you are right , probably . MR . SPENCER Well , that 's  --  er  --  the important thing , after all , is n't it ? Hudson 's interest . MR . HOUGHTON I should say it was his capital ! HOUGHTON roars with laughter at his own quip . MR . SPENCER Then you 'll submit our recommendation to the Medical Board ? DR . WREN Yes . And they 'll O.K. it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through . DR . HOCHBERG throws up his hands . p. 83 MR . SPENCER Fine ! Fine ! After all , Dr. Hochberg , as you say , we 're here in a common cause  --  the hospital . He smiles . Looks over his papers.Mm ! Guess that 's about all ! He glances around.Anything else , gentlemen ? Mr. Houghton ? HOUGHTON gathers his papers , shakes his head " No , " puts papers in portfolio.Dr . Wren ? DR . WREN looks at his watch:No . Nothing ! MR . RUMMOND What time have you there ? Compares watches , nods , rises , and gets his coat . MR . SPENCER Anybody ? Then the meeting is  --  DR . JOSH GORDON One second , Mr. Spencer ! Since you 're discussing this with Mr. Hudson , I think it would be a fine thing if we could extend our X-ray therapy department . MR . SPENCER First give him the associateship , then we 'll talk about equipment . DR . LEO HOCHBERG rises:Do n't count your chickens , Josh ! DR . JOSH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LEO HOCHBERG Yes . But he wo n't accept it . p. 84 MR . SPENCER smiles:What makes you say that ? DR . LEO HOCHBERG I know the boy ! He 's too honest , too wise , to sacrifice his career for a nice office and an easy practice . Besides , he wo n't have the time . He 's going to work with me ! And er well He laughs.It was perhaps a bit foolish to waste so much energy arguing the matter . He starts for the door . MR . SPENCER laughs:As a matter of fact  --  I had dinner last night at the Hudsons ' and I spoke to Ferguson about the appointment . He 's delighted with the idea . DR . LEO HOCHBERG stops  --  returns  --  incredulous:He said that ? MR . SPENCER Certainly ! And why not ? It 's a fine opportunity for him . Looks around.Nothing else , gentlemen ? No ? Bangs his mallet on the table.Meeting is adjourned ! All except HOCHBERG move toward the door . He stands there , stock-still , palpably hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ACT TWOScene 2 The library . DR . McCABE is sitting in an armchair , reading . MICHAELSON is seated at the long table . Nearby , SHORTY is swinging an imaginary golf club . DR . OTIS My stance was all wrong , see ? That 's one reason I sliced so much . McCABE looks up , grunts , and goes back to his book . DR . MICHAELSON I would n't even know how to hold a club any more . DR . OTIS You 'd be surprised . A couple of games , and you 're right back in form . Look at Ferguson ! He has n't played tennis in years  --  since high school , I think he said  --  and yet , last week he beat Laura two sets in a row . And that girl swings a mean racquet . DR . PETE BRADLEY enters , sour-faced:That patient in 310 ! Boy , I 'd like to give him two dozen spinal taps and bite the point off the needle to make sure he feels them . DR . MICHAELSON Whoa ! Laughs.Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah ! The smart alec ! He invited me to share this special lunch with him . When I heard lunch , I accepted  --  he snaps his fingers  --  like that ! Then , morosely.Smart alec ! p. 86 DR . OTIS Well , what 's the matter with that ? DR . PETE BRADLEY Do you know what 310 's here for ? Shrilly.Rectal feeding ! The others laugh . DR . MCCABE looks up , annoyed:Sh ! Sh ! Quiet ! They glance over at him and quiet down . He goes back to his books . They kid PETE in an undertone , muffling their laughter . DR . CUNNINGHAM enters  --  looks around irritably:Where 's Ferguson ? DR . OTIS Not here , Doctor . DR . CUNNINGHAM I 've been trying to find him since twelve o'clock . What kind of house-service is this ? Where is he ? DR . MICHAELSON Why , you see , Doctor  --  Ferguson 's being married next week , and he 's at a ceremony rehearsal or something . DR .

PETE BRADLEY I 'm sorry , Doctor . DR . MCCABE What for ? You 're quite right . He is . The interns grin . McCABE looks at them quizzically . He turns to SHORTY.Young man ! How would you treat the different forms of acute pancreatitis ? DR . OTIS a study in blankness:Er acute pancrea mm Why , the same way . I 'd  --  DR . MCCABE Wrong ! Pause , he shakes his head at SHORTY.You play golf , huh ? He tosses a pamphlet to SHORTY.Read that , and find out something about pancreatitis . He suddenly draws his shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He turns to MICHAELSON.Will you see if that window 's open ? There 's a draft in here , someplace . MICHAELSON crosses to the window . Through the glass-paned door , we see FERGUSON , in civilian clothes , and LAURA coming up the corridor . They are in high spirits , joking and laughing . FERGUSON starts to enter the library , but LAURA hesitates in the doorway . p. 88 DR . PETE BRADLEY How was it ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON grinning:Terrible . DR . MICHAELSON to FERGUSON and LAURA:Ho ' there ! To McCABE.They 're all closed , Doctor . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON to LAURA:Come on in ! LAURA HUDSON Well  --  is it all right for me to  --  ?

McCABE reaches for his cane , rises rustily , and goes out mumbling . p. 89 LAURA HUDSON watches him go , then turns to the others , who grin:Perhaps I should n't have come in here . DR . OTIS Nonsense ! DR . MAC CRAWFORD It 's perfectly O.K. DR . PETE BRADLEY Do n't mind old Doc McCABE ! He thinks the world ended in 1917 when he retired . LAURA HUDSON Retired ! DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Yes , but he still comes around to talk , read , watch operations . Gives us hell for not knowing anything . Medicine 's not just his profession  --  it 's his life . He shakes his head admiringly.Great guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way I want to grow old ! LAURA HUDSON Not I. When I 'm too old to enjoy life firsthand I want to lie down , and say , " Laura , it was good while it lasted . Now , fini ! " DR . OTIS My idea exactly .

To LAURA.Most doctors die pretty young , you know . LAURA looks pained . DR . MICHAELSON That 's right . The strain gets them around forty-five . Heart goes bad . p. 90 LAURA HUDSON glances at FERGUSON and grimaces:There 's a pleasant thought . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON laughs:Cheerful bunch ! DR .

LAURA HUDSON Can I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LAURA HUDSON puts a cigarette in her mouth and waits for a light:Well ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON What ? She points to her cigarette.Oh !

GEORGE FERGUSON I 've never been so high ! You know , dear , I love this old place , and yet , my God , I ca n't wait to get out of here .

LAURA HUDSON Why ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Well , I  --  want to talk to Dr. Hochberg first . LAURA HUDSON laughs:Why are you so afraid of Hocky ? He wo n't bite you ! Or , do you think by delaying it you can change my mind  --  and work with Hocky when we come back ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON No , that 's not it . LAURA HUDSON Because if you do , I 'm warning you ! I 'll just drop out of the picture , George . Even if we 're married  --  you 'll come home one day , and I just wo n't be there . p. 94 DR . GEORGE FERGUSON takes her in his arms .

GEORGE FERGUSON Of course he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know who would n't give a right eye for the chance to work with Dr. Hochberg . You do n't realize it , dear , he 's an important man . He LAURA HUDSON impatiently:The important man , George , is the man who knows how to live . I love Hocky , I think an awful lot of him . But he 's like my father . They have no outside interests at all . They 're flat  --  they 're colorless . They 're not men  --  they 're caricatures ! Oh , do n't become like them , George ! Do n't be an important man and crack up at forty-five . I want our lives together to be full and rich and beautiful ! I want it so much . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON fervently:Oh , my dear , so do I.

HOCHBERG enters , passing them . He pauses to watch them go , then turns to FERGUSON . LAURA HUDSON Hello , Hocky ! DR . LEO HOCHBERG Hello , Laura ! To FERGUSON.Who was that ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Mrs. D'Andrea , mother of that case automobile accident this morning . DR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know  --  you gave him a shot of tetanus antitoxin ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Dr. Michaelson took care of that . DR . LEO HOCHBERG He did ? Good ! Glances at his watch.Where have you been since twelve o'clock ? p. 97 DR . GEORGE FERGUSON I was gone a little longer than I expected to be . LAURA HUDSON It was awfully important , Hocky . DR . LEO HOCHBERG It must have been . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON I left Michaelson in charge to cover me . I only meant to be gone half an hour . DR . LEO HOCHBERG In the meantime it was two . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Sorry , Doctor ! This wo n't happen again . DR . LEO HOCHBERG I hope not . He relaxes  --  becomes the old familiar again.Watch it ! A few more days to go . Your record is clean . Keep it that way ! There is a pause . HOCHBERG looks at GEORGE steadily for a moment . GEORGE becomes self-conscious and uneasy . Finally DR . HOCHBERG speaks.George I heard something this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . Pause.You still want to accomplish something in medicine ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Certainly . DR . LEO HOCHBERG You mean that ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Yes . DR . LEO HOCHBERG to LAURA:You love George , do n't you , Laura ? p. 98 LAURA HUDSON You know I do . DR . LEO HOCHBERG Of course you do and you want to help him  --  but that 's not the way , Laura . Believe me , nobody can help George but himself  --  and hard work ! He can not buy this ; he must earn it . To FERGUSON.That appointment they talked to you about , George you wo n't be ready for it . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON After a year with von Eiselsberg , I thought DR . LEO HOCHBERG One year ? He shakes his head . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON It 's not as if I were going to drop my studies . I intend to keep on . HOCHBERG shakes his head . LAURA HUDSON I do n't see why not ! DR . LEO HOCHBERG to LAURA:My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked so terribly hard till now , Hocky . If it 's going to make things easier DR . LEO HOCHBERG There are no easy roads in medicine . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON I did n't expect it to be easy . I counted on work . Hard work ! DR . LEO HOCHBERG Ten years of it ! Then yes . p. 99 LAURA HUDSON I ca n't see how it 's going to hurt George . DR . LEO HOCHBERG There are a great many things you ca n't see , Laura . LAURA HUDSON If he goes into practice , we 'll have some time for ourselves , Hocky . DR . LEO HOCHBERG Time ? How ? There are only twenty-four hours in a day . He 's working with me and if  --  He suddenly stops short as the truth strikes him.Or is he ? To FERGUSON.Are you ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Doctor Hochberg , I have n't loafed yet , and I do n't intend to start now . But Laura and I are young , we love each other . I want a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think that 's asking too much . DR . LEO HOCHBERG I see . I see . Pause.So , you 've decided not to come with me next year . There 's a long silence . Finally LAURA answers apologetically . LAURA HUDSON After all , Hocky , we feel that we 'll be happier that way  --  and DR . LEO HOCHBERG Of course , Laura . It 's George 's life and yours . You 've a right to decide for yourselves  --  what you 're going to do with it . I did n't mean to meddle . p. 100 LAURA HUDSON Oh , Hocky , you know we do n't feel that way about you . DR . LEO HOCHBERG I 'm glad you do n't . Pause . Trying to hide his hurt , he continues.How 's Papa ? LAURA HUDSON So-so . He still has an occasional attack . HOCHBERG:Still smokes , I suppose . LAURA HUDSON nods:When I 'm not around . He 's building again . DR . LEO HOCHBERG Well  --  do n't let him work too hard ! LAURA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You know Dad ! He usually has his way . DR . LEO HOCHBERG glances at FERGUSON , then nods significantly:Yes . DR . HOCHBERG turns to GEORGE and says gently.You 'd better get into your uniform , George . We may have to operate shortly . A new case just came in on the surgical service . One of our own nurses . What 's her name ? That nice little girl up in Pediatrics ? Oh yes  --  Dennin ! Barbara Dennin ! You remember her ? Pediatrics . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON embarrassed:Oh , yes , yes . I remember her  --  an excellent nurse . p. 101 DR . LEO HOCHBERG Poor child ! Such a nice little girl , too . Sepsis ! DR . GEORGE FERGUSON sympathetically:Oh ! That 's awful ! She bad ? DR . LEO HOCHBERG Temperature 105 , blood count way up . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Tch ! What was it  --  ruptured appendix ? DR . LEO HOCHBERG shakes his head:Septic abortion ! DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Abortion ? DR . LEO HOCHBERG Yes . Poor girl  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we can do . Meet me up there . He starts towards the door . FERGUSON stands there , his brow wrinkling . DR . MICHAELSON entering:That D'Andrea fellow is still unconscious . Seems to be something the matter with his lower jaw . DR . LEO HOCHBERG What ! DR . MICHAELSON Protruding  --  somewhat rigid . Thought it might be tetanus . DR . LEO HOCHBERG No ! Not so soon ! Anyway , you gave him antitoxin , did n't you ? DR . MICHAELSON Why  --  er He shoots a quick glance at FERGUSON.No ! p. 102 DR . LEO HOCHBERG What ? Angrily.Do n't you know yet that T.A.T . is routine in this hospital ? DR . MICHAELSON Yes , sir . But I thought  --  To FERGUSON.You did n't tell me . I thought you gave it ! DR . LEO HOCHBERG to FERGUSON:Dr . Ferguson ! DR . GEORGE FERGUSON I intended to mention it to him . I guess  --  I  --  forgot . DR . LEO HOCHBERG Forgot ? Is that a thing to forget ? You should have given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hocky , I dragged him away  --  we were late . DR . LEO HOCHBERG That 's no excuse . He 's not supposed to leave the house at all ! And a very sick house , too . You know that , Dr. Ferguson ! DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Yes , sir . LAURA HUDSON Oh , Hocky  --  it was important ! Terribly important ! It was a rehearsal of our wedding . DR . LEO HOCHBERG A rehearsal ? Yes , Laura , that 's nice . A rehearsal of your wedding . But do you realize , upstairs , there is a boy all smashed to bits . There 'll be no wedding for him , if he develops tetanus . To FERGUSON.Dr . Ferguson ! Inject that antitoxin at once ! p. 103 DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Yes , sir ! He goes . DR . LEO HOCHBERG turns to LAURA , looks at her a moment , then shakes his head and says slowly:Laura , you deserve to be spanked ! LAURA 'S face becomes angry and defiant . Her jaw tightens , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work means ? LAURA HUDSON Of course I do , Hocky . DR . LEO HOCHBERG very softly , almost to himself:No no , you do n't ! Then , louder.Would you like to see , perhaps ? LAURA HUDSON Yes why not ? DR . LEO HOCHBERG glances toward the corridor where MICHAELSON is standing , talking to a nurse:Dr . Michaelson ! MICHAELSON enters.Take Miss Hudson here upstairs , see that she gets a cap and gown , and have her in the operating room in about  --  With a sharp jerk of his arm he bares his wrist watch and looks at it .  --  twenty minutes ! Without so much as another glance at LAURA , he marches briskly out of the library . BLACK OUT p. 104 Act 2 , Scene 3 ACT TWOScene 3 The end of the corridor . In the corner are the night desk and a medicine cabinet . To the left of them is a room , numbered 401 . To the right are the elevator doors . A WOMAN and a BOY are waiting for the elevator .

The aged COUPLE cross to the left and disappear off . FERGUSON starts to go into 401 , stops , turns to MARY . MARY , who has been eyeing him , looks away . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON How is she ? MARY shakes her head . She is pale , grim , restrained.Temperature ? NURSE MARY RYAN 106 . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON 106 ? NURSE MARY RYAN Yeah ! DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Delirious ?

NURSE MARY RYAN Yeah ! DR . GEORGE FERGUSON stunned:Oh ! He turns to enter the room . NURSE MARY RYAN Better wait ! Dr. Hochberg 's in there . She 's quiet , now . If you went in she might start talking again . The NURSE with the basin and towels comes out of the room , sees FERGUSON , smiles at him , and as she crosses left , throws a cheery hello to him over her shoulder . He does n't answer . NURSE , puzzled , exits left . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON God ! I never dreamed this would happen . NURSE MARY RYAN Men do n't  --  usually . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Why did n't she come to me ? Why did n't she tell me ? Why did she keep away ? NURSE MARY RYAN I guess that was my fault . Long time ago I saw she was falling for you .

And to top it all , she 's going to be kicked out of here ! DR . GEORGE FERGUSON They would n't do that ! NURSE MARY RYAN Would n't they , though ? Ask Miss Hackett ! And she wo n't get into any other hospital , either . They 'll see to that ! DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Poor kid ! NURSE MARY RYAN It might be a lucky break for her if she just passed out ! DR .

Ah , Wren , some of our laws belong to the Dark Ages ! Why ca n't we help the poor and the ignorant ? The others will always help themselves  --  law or no law . DR .

FERGUSON stands there a moment . MARY comes out . She puts the alcohol and iodine back on the emergency shelf . NURSE MARY RYAN Well , that 's  --  The elevator begins to whine . MARY and FERGUSON glance over at the indicator dial over the elevator door . It slowly comes round from O.R . to 3 , where it stops . The door opens with a clang . An ORDERLY steps out , backward , pulling a rolling stretcher after him . He turns to MARY and grins . ORDERLY Well , here I am , sweetheart ! p. 112 NURSE MARY RYAN suddenly bursts into tears:Who the hell are you calling sweetheart ? She hurries into the room . ORDERLY puzzled:What the  --  He looks at FERGUSON , embarrassed , smiles , and shakes his head in bewilderment . Then he wheels the stretcher into the room . THE ELEVATOR MAN who has kept the elevator door open , calls to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevator , then , in a low , harsh voice:Up ! Operating room ! The door clangs shut , the elevator whines siren-like , rising to a crescendo , as the indicator dial goes up . BLACK OUT p. 113 Act 2 , Scene 4 ACT TWO Scene 4 The Operating Room . A feeling of sharp , white , gleaming cleanliness ! Back center , the huge , hanging , kettledrum lamp , with its hundreds of reflecting mirrors , throws a brilliant , shadowless light on the chromium operating table . All the nooks and corners of the room are rounded off to facilitate cleansing , and to prevent the accumulation of dust . To the right is the sterilizing room , with its polished nickel autoclaves , bubbling and steaming . To the left is a long north skylight , double-paned . There is one STERILE NURSE , wearing cap and gown , mask and long rubber gloves ; there are two UNSTERILE NURSES , similarly clothed but wearing no gloves . They move to and fro like so many pistons , efficiently , quickly , quietly  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands a row of half a dozen sinks , the faucets in them turned on and off by means of knee-stirrups attached underneath . Above , a shelf holds cans of sterile brushes , pans of liquid soap , and eight-minute glasses  --  one to each sink . Well apart from these sinks , and to the right , are two basins in a white-enamel stand ; one contains blue bichloride , the other alcohol . Beyond them again stands a foot-pedal gown drum , scarred from its purifying baths of steam . To the left is a long glove table , on which are the gloves wrapped in canvas " books , " sterile powder can , and towels covered by a sterile sheet . WREN , in cap and mask , is dipping his hands in the bichloride pan ; PETE , at the washbasin , is cleaning his nails with an orange-stick , and MICHAELSON is scrubbing his hands with long , easy , rhythmic strokes of the brush . They are chatting quietly . The STERILE NURSE goes to the glove table and folds over the sheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes from the sterilizing room , carrying a steaming tray of instruments to the instrument table at the foot of the operating table . The STERILE NURSE returns to the instrument table , and there is a clink of instruments as she arranges them . WREN holds up his hands so that the bichloride rolls down the forearm and off the elbow ; he repeats this once more in the bichloride , and twice in the alcohol pan , then walks away , holding his dripping hands high and away from him . A STERILE NURSE gives him a sterile towel . He dries his hands , using the separate sides and ends of the towel for each hand , then he tosses the towel to the floor , and crosses to the glove table . An UNSTERILE NURSE quickly crosses , picks up the towel , and takes it away . WREN powders his hands , opens a glove book , gingerly plucks out a glove , handling it by the cuff , careful not to touch the outside of the glove , as that might still soil it ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slips it on . The second glove he slips on , careful not to touch his wrist with his already gloved hand . He then snaps the gloves over the cuffs of his jacket , wraps a sterile towel about his hands and walks over to the operating table . PETE finishes scrubbing , goes to the bichloride basin , and dips his hands , using the same technique as WREN . When he is through with the alcohol , however , he turns to the gown drum . The STERILE NURSE crosses to the drum , steps on the pedal , which raises the lid , and deftly extracts a folded gown , without touching the drum itself . She releases her foot , and the lid clunks back . She hands the folded gown to him ; he takes a corner of it , unrolls it , and slips into it . An UNSTERILE NURSE comes up behind , careful not to touch him , and ties the gown for him . The whole effect is that of a smooth , well-oiled machine , a routine so studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be casual  --  as they are . One of the UNSTERILE NURSES enters with LAURA , whom she has just helped into a cap and gown . FIRST NURSE All right ? p. 114 LAURA HUDSON Yes . DR . MICHAELSON to LAURA:Well , you 're all set , now ! LAURA HUDSON smiles nervously:Yes  --  thanks ! DR . MICHAELSON Not at all ! A pleasure . LAURA HUDSON doubtfully:Oh ! The pleasure 's all mine ! DR . MICHAELSON laughs:I 'll bet it is . LAURA HUDSON This gown seems awfully wrinkled . FIRST NURSE They 're never pressed . That would unsterilize them . LAURA HUDSON Oh ! I see . Enter HOCHBERG and FERGUSON in operating pajamas . They are putting on their masks.Hello ! DR . LEO HOCHBERG Oh , hello ! To FERGUSON.We have a guest ! He turns over the eight-minute glass and begins to scrub up . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON stands stock-still for a moment:Laura ! What ? . LAURA HUDSON Surprise ! She starts to go toward GEORGE . p. 115 DR . LEO HOCHBERG warning her back with a quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner ! Do n't come near us ! We 're getting clean ! You 're full of contamination . LAURA HUDSON Oh  --  am I ? FERGUSON begins to scrub up . DR . LEO HOCHBERG Yes . A long pause while they scrub . HOCHBERG , still scrubbing , turns to LAURA.Well  --  how do you feel ? LAURA HUDSON trying to bluff off her nervousness:Great ! DR . LEO HOCHBERG Mm , hm ! LAURA HUDSON How do I look ? She holds out her gown at both sides . DR . LEO HOCHBERG Very becoming ! LAURA HUDSON Think so , George ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Yes  --  very ! DR . LEO HOCHBERG You can look around , but keep out of the way ! Do n't touch anything ! Put your hands behind your back ! A long silence , broken only by the rasping sound of scrubbing brushes . LAURA stares , fascinated . DR . LEO HOCHBERG Oh , Nurse  --  A NURSE comes over.See that Miss Hudson here gets a mask before she goes in . Find a stool for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want her to miss anything ! p. 116 LAURA HUDSON wryly:Thanks , Hocky ! DR . LEO HOCHBERG Do n't mention it , Laura ! DR . HOCHBERG finishes scrubbing and goes through the same routine as the others . When he gets his gown he disappears to a corner of the operating room , hidden by the basins . FERGUSON also goes through the routine of gown and gloves , etc . DR . WREN Orderly ! Orderly ! ORDERLY enters from anesthesia room:Yes , sir ? DR . WREN Bring the patient in ! BARBARA is wheeled in by the ORDERLY . As she enters , WREN bends over to look at her . FERGUSON comes over . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON How is she , Doctor ? BARBARA DENNIN George ! DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Yes ? BARBARA DENNIN What are they going to do to me ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON There 's nothing to be afraid of , Barbara ! BARBARA DENNIN You wo n't let them hurt me ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON No , of course not . BARBARA DENNIN Will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! p. 117 DR . GEORGE FERGUSON I 'll be there . BARBARA DENNIN Thanks , dear . I loved you . I do n't care . Her head goes back . DR . WREN looks at FERGUSON , who is rigid . Then at LAURA , who is equally rigid . He turns to ORDERLY and says , sharply:Come on ! Come on ! The ORDERLY wheels BARBARA to the operating table . WREN follows . The patient is transferred to the operating table . LAURA HUDSON What was that all about ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Laura , I 'm sorry as hell  --  I wish I LAURA HUDSON George ! Is it ? She clutches his arm . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON recoiling from her touch:Do n't ! You must n't ! Stand away ! Over there ! You 've unsterilized the gown ! He tears off his gown and gloves , throws them on the floor , and calls into the sterilizing room.Nurse ! Nurse ! Sterile gown , gloves , towels ! Quick ! He turns to LAURA , explains , apologetically.We 've got to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , picks up the gown and gloves . He dips his hands into the bichloride pan , and then the alcohol pan . A STERILE NURSE brings him a sterile gown , he unfolds it and slides into it . And the UNSTERILE NURSE , behind him , ties it . In the meantime , another NURSE returns with a sterile towel . He dries his hands , and throws the towel on the floor . The UNSTERILE NURSE picks it up and takes it away . The STERILE NURSE powders his hands , brings him a sterile glove book and opens it . He plucks out a glove , and puts it on , the NURSE helping him , in approved aseptic technique , by thrusting her fingers under the cuff , and pushing home the glove . In the meantime , the patient , concealed by the people around her , has been anaesthetized , and is being draped . All the time , LAURA has been staring at FERGUSON . FERGUSON , working the fingers of the gloves , looks at LAURA . Exit the ORDERLY with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an affair with that girl  --  or what ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON almost inaudibly:Yes . LAURA HUDSON Oh ! A bitter little laugh.That 's a funny one ! DR . LEO HOCHBERG on a footstool , bends over the patient  --  calls:Dr . Ferguson ! The call is taken up by a number of voices . A NURSE crosses to FERGUSON . FIRST NURSE Dr. Ferguson ! The patient is draped and ready ! DR . GEORGE FERGUSON All right ! I 'm coming ! He goes to the operating table . FIRST NURSE to LAURA:If you want to watch  --  you 'd better go over . I 'll get a stool for you  --  mask ! LAURA HUDSON No , thanks ! I 've had enough ! I 've had enough ! SECOND NURSE enters:Here ! Here ! Get busy ! Notices LAURA.You ! What 's the matter ? You look so Feel ill , dear ? To FIRST NURSE.Take her out ! Near a window ! Give her some water ! p. 119 LAURA HUDSON No ! No ! I 'm I 'm fine ! Thanks ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and exits . The NURSES look at each other and grin . FIRST NURSE Med student ? SECOND NURSE Of course ! First time ! What else ? FIRST NURSE She 's got a long way to go , yet ! They laugh . Nurse and doctors about the table turn and say , " Sh ! Sh ! " The NURSES immediately hush . DR . LEO HOCHBERG Ready , Dr. Wren ? DR . WREN All set ! DR . LEO HOCHBERG Ready , Dr. Ferguson ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Ready ! DR . LEO HOCHBERG reaching out his hand , without looking up:Scalpel ! The OPERATING NURSE hands over the scalpel , cutting a gleaming arc through the air , then she clumps it into HOCHBERG 'S hand . He bends over the patient . There is a sudden burst of activity and gleam of clamps about the table . The UNSTERILE NURSES , hands behind their backs , stand on tiptoe , and crane their necks to see over the shoulders of the ASSISTANT . All lights dim down , except the operating light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white brilliance. @x FERGUSON 'S room . The next morning . The shade is drawn , the room dark , except for the small lamp at the bed . FERGUSON is sitting on the bed , his head in his hands . His clothes are wrinkled  --  he has n't changed them all night . His hair is mussed , his eyes red . A knock at the door . FERGUSON does n't stir . The knock is repeated . FERGUSON still remains motionless . The door slowly opens . HOCHBERG enters . DR . LEO HOCHBERG Good morning , George . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Oh . Good morning . HOCHBERG pulls up the shade . A great burst of sunlight streams in , blinding GEORGE . He turns his face away , rubs his eyes . What time ? He picks up the clock.Oh  --  I did n't know it was so late . DR . LEO HOCHBERG Lovely out , is n't it ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Yes . He rises wearily , goes to the washbasin , washes himself , and combs his hair . DR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desk:Hm . That 's a fine specimen . Ah yes you 've been doing some study on brain surgery ? p. 121 DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Yes . DR . LEO HOCHBERG Fascinating work . Miss Dennin 's temperature is down this morning . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON I know . DR . LEO HOCHBERG The nurse tells me you watched the case all last night . That 's very nice . Hm . Excellent book  --  this . You should read all of Cushing 's reports . How is  --  er  --  D'Andrea ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Examined those pictures . He did have a fracture of the tibia of the left leg . No further evidence of internal injury . He 'll be all right , I guess . DR . LEO HOCHBERG Good . Good . He 's a lucky boy . He looked badly hurt . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Dr. Hochberg . There 's something I 've got to tell you . DR . LEO HOCHBERG quickly:I know . Wren told me . Pause . HOCHBERG looks at the specimen.Great field  --  brain surgery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You must think it was pretty low of me . DR . LEO HOCHBERG George George ! DR . GEORGE FERGUSON I did n't know anything about it till yesterday . I would n't have let her I swear I would n't have . p. 122 DR . LEO HOCHBERG It was a bad job . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Oh , that poor kid . God , I ought to be shot . DR . LEO HOCHBERG Did you force her to have an affair with you ; or did she come to you of her own free will ? Then why do you blame yourself so ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON That has nothing to do with it . DR . LEO HOCHBERG That has everything to do with it ! DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Dr. Hochberg , you do n't know what she 's up against . DR . LEO HOCHBERG I know . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON It 's not as if she were just a tramp . She 's a fine , sensitive girl ! God . What a mess I 've gotten her into ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital  --  nowheres to go  --  no one to turn to . What 's she going to do ? DR . LEO HOCHBERG Do n't worry . We 'll find something for her . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON just giving her a job  --  is n't going to help her very much . There 's only one decent thing I 'm going to marry her if she 'll have me . DR . LEO HOCHBERG George ! Stop talking like an idiot ! Pull yourself together ! What about Laura ? p. 123 DR . GEORGE FERGUSON She 's through with me , Dr. Hochberg . DR . LEO HOCHBERG She knows ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Yes . I kept phoning her all day yesterday  --  all last night . She would n't come to the phone would n't even talk to me , Dr. Hochberg . DR . LEO HOCHBERG Hm that 's too bad . Yet you know , George , in a way  --  that 's not the worst that could have happened to you . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON No ! Do n't say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , my boy . Remember that 's the master word  --  work . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON I 'm going to marry that girl . DR . LEO HOCHBERG What for ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON I have to take care of her , do n't I ? DR . LEO HOCHBERG I see . You 've saved some money then ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Out of what ? DR . LEO HOCHBERG Then how are you going to help her ? How are you going to take care of her ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON I 'm going into practice . DR . LEO HOCHBERG Mid-Victorian idealism wo n't solve this problem , George . p. 124 DR . GEORGE FERGUSON That girl is human , is n't she ? She needs me . DR . LEO HOCHBERG If you think you can provide for both of you by first starting practice  --  then you just do n't know . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON I 'll manage somehow . I 'm not afraid of that . DR . LEO HOCHBERG Remember Levine ? I got a letter from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a practice . The loudspeaker in the corridor starts calling " Dr. Hochberg . " They 're starving , George . He begs me to lend him twenty dollars . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON I do n't see what that has to do with me . DR . LEO HOCHBERG You did n't know him six years ago . He would n't letme help him , then . He was sure ! So confident ! And better equipped for practice than you are . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Possibly ! DR . LEO HOCHBERG I wo n't answer for Levine at least he loved Katherine . But you do n't love this girl . It was an accident  --  and for that you want to ruin yourself  --  the rest of your life  --  destroy your ambition , your ideals  --  fill yourself with bitterness , live day and night with a woman who will grow to despise you . p. 125 DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Dr. Hochberg . Please  --  it 's no use . I 've thought of all that ! It does n't make any difference . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to do it . DR . LEO HOCHBERG picks up the phone:Yes ? Dr. Hochberg . Yes , hello . That 's all right . Wait for me down in the  --  no Come up here to 106 , 106 . Yes . Is the man there at the desk ? Yes . Hello , Arthur . Please ask one of the orderlies to show this young lady up to 106 . Yes , thank you . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Is that Laura ? DR . LEO HOCHBERG Yes . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON I ca n't see her now ! I ca n't talk to her . DR . LEO HOCHBERG Do n't be a child ! You 've got to see her and have this out . Pause . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Dr. Hochberg , I want you to know that I appreciate all you 've done for me . DR . LEO HOCHBERG What have I done ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON I mean yesterday . I I must have seemed very ungrateful . But it 's just because there are so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LEO HOCHBERG I know . It 's our instinct to live , to enjoy ourselves . All of us. p. 126 DR . GEORGE FERGUSON I love Laura so much . She 's so full of life and fun , and all the things I 've missed for so many years . I just did n't have the guts to give them up . I kidded myself that I could have that , and still go on . And last night , I realized I kidded myself out of the most important thing that ever happened to me , a chance to work with you . DR . LEO HOCHBERG Do you still want to ? You can , if you do . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON No  --  not now . DR . LEO HOCHBERG But why ? If you realize , now , what you really want DR . GEORGE FERGUSON I 'm going into practice , I told you . DR . LEO HOCHBERG Now , George , calm down . Give yourself a chance to think it over . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON I 've thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George . You 'll be sorry . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON I ca n't just ignore this ! DR . LEO HOCHBERG In that case , you 're through  --  you 're finished  --  you 're DR . GEORGE FERGUSON All right ! Then I am . Why not ? What good 's a profession that ca n't give you bread and butter after you 've sweated out ten years of your life on it ? And if I ca n't make a go of practice , I 'll find a job at something else  --  and to hell with medicine ! I wo n't starve . I 'll always make a living . LAURA appears in the doorway , accompanied by an ORDERLY . p. 127 ORDERLY Right here , miss . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Good morning , Laura . LAURA HUDSON deliberately ignoring GEORGE , looking only at HOCHBERG , clipping every word:Hello , Hocky . Did you want me up here ? DR . LEO HOCHBERG Yes . Come in , Laura . LAURA HUDSON Sorry to call you so early , but DR . LEO HOCHBERG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's still standing in the doorway , tense and hard . Impatiently.Come in , come in . She wavers a moment , then enters.Sit down . LAURA HUDSON No . I 'm in a hurry , Hocky . I just wanted to see you for a minute alone . DR . LEO HOCHBERG Sit down , Laura . LAURA HUDSON I suppose you wondered why I disappeared , yesterday . DR . LEO HOCHBERG No . I heard all about it . LAURA HUDSON Oh , you did ? A laugh , is n't it ? DR . LEO HOCHBERG Not particularly . LAURA HUDSON Well , you spanked me all right . p. 128 DR . LEO HOCHBERG Harder than I meant , Laura . Forgive me . LAURA HUDSON Oh , that 's all right . Better now than later , Hocky . DR . LEO HOCHBERG Will you please sit down , Laura ? LAURA , suddenly limp , sits down . HOCHBERG , scrutinizing her face closely.Sleep much last night ? LAURA HUDSON Sure . Why not ? She puts a cigarette into her mouth , searches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pocket , to find a match for her.Light , Hocky ? HOCHBERG gives her a light . She exhales a huge puff of smoke.I 'm washed up with the whole business , Hocky . DR . LEO HOCHBERG Yes , of course you are of course . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON I 'm sorry you feel so bitter about it , Laura . LAURA HUDSON How did you expect me to feel ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON I do n't blame you . I LAURA HUDSON Thanks . That 's sweet of you . DR . LEO HOCHBERG Neither do I blame him , Laura . LAURA HUDSON There 's no excuse for a thing like that  --  you know it , Hocky . None at all . p. 129 DR . LEO HOCHBERG I know nothing  --  except the human body , a little . And I have n't met the wise man or woman , Laura , whom impulse could n't make a fool of . LAURA HUDSON If you want to reason that way , there is n't anything you could n't justify . DR . LEO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's so far beyond that . FERGUSON starts for the door.Where are you going ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Upstairs . DR . LEO HOCHBERG Wait , George ! Wait a minute ! DR . GEORGE FERGUSON There 's nothing more to be said , Dr. Hochberg . Laura 's perfectly right . LAURA HUDSON rises:Do n't leave on my account . I 've got to go now , anyway . I 've got to pack . I 'm sailing on the Olympic , tonight . Going to get as far away from all this as I can . She laughs.Humph ! I was making plans . I was worried all the time . God ! What a fool I was . DR . LEO HOCHBERG Do you think he 's having such an easy time of it ? LAURA HUDSON Oh , he 'll take care of himself . DR . LEO HOCHBERG Maybe you 'd better go home now , Laura . p. 130 LAURA HUDSON I think it was a pretty rotten trick . DR . LEO HOCHBERG Stop it ! Laura , stop it ! LAURA HUDSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy for me  --  but he did find time to That 's what hurts , Hocky ! Hurts like the devil ! DR . LEO HOCHBERG Do n't you think I know how you feel , Laura ? The loudspeaker is calling , " Dr. Hochberg . " LAURA HUDSON You think I still care ? Well , I do n't ! DR . LEO HOCHBERG That 's fine ! Then it does n't make any difference to you that right now he 's throwing his life away . Goes to the phone , picks it up , speaks into it.Yes ? Dr. Hochberg ! To LAURA.He 's going to marry her , Laura . LAURA HUDSON No ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Dr. Hochberg ! Please ! DR . LEO HOCHBERG Yes . And go into practice , and starve , and give up his studies , and maybe get out of medicine altogether . The thing he 's meant for ! And worked so hard for . Into the phone , suddenly tense.Yes ! What ! Prepare a hypo of caffeine , and adrenaline , long needle ! At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 131 DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Do you want me  --  ? DR . LEO HOCHBERG No no no . You stay here ! He hurries out . LAURA stands there a moment looking at GEORGE , then starts to go . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Laura ! LAURA HUDSON What ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON I do n't want you to go away feeling like this . LAURA HUDSON What difference does it make how I feel ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON A great deal to me . LAURA HUDSON pause:You love her , do n't you ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON I love you , Laura . LAURA HUDSON laughs bitterly:Yes , I 'm sure you do . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON grasps both of LAURA 'S arms tightly:I do n't care whether you believe it or not , Laura , it just happens that I do . LAURA HUDSON Let go  --  let go my arm ! You 're DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Sorry ! He turns from her and sinks down despondently on the bed . p. 132 LAURA HUDSON after a pause:Then how ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wink last night , George . I was trying to figure this out . But it does n't make sense except that I do n't know . If you cared for me , how could you do that ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON I do n't know myself , Laura . Everything had gone wrong that day . Six long operations . I had a battle with Cunningham , I lost a patient . Things sort of kept piling up till I thought I 'd bust this kid came to my room for some notes she was sympathetic and lonely herself , and well But after that I did n't see her around , and I just forgot about it . You 'd think she 'd come to me when this happened . But she did n't . I know I should have looked her up . I know I was pretty small and rotten . I thought I thought it did n't mean very much to her . But it did , Laura ! Now she 's up against it , and LAURA HUDSON If we meant anything at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't give a damn about ceremony ! But the point is you did n't really care about me , George . Not for a minute . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON I wanted you more than anything else in the world that night , Laura . But we 'd quarrelled and  --  you would n't even go out with me. p. 133 LAURA HUDSON It was that night ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Yes . LAURA HUDSON Oh ! DR . GEORGE FERGUSON I did n't want to give up Hocky and I did n't want to give you up and I was fighting you and LAURA HUDSON Through her ? DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Yes . LAURA HUDSON laughs bitterly:And you say you loved me ! DR . GEORGE FERGUSON If I had n't , I 'd have called quits then and there , Laura . I 'd have gone to Vienna and worked my way through . That 's what I was planning to do before I met you . Alone in Vienna I 'd really accomplish something . LAURA HUDSON Well , why do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If it 's so important to you . I wo n't be around to distract you ! Go on ! But you 're not , you see . You 're going to marry a girl you say you do n't care for . You 're going to let a casual incident rob you of all the things you say are important . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON It 's not a casual incident , any more , Laura . LAURA HUDSON All right , make your beautiful gestures . Marry her ! p. 134 DR . GEORGE FERGUSON I 'm going to . LAURA HUDSON Go ahead ! And inside of a year you 'll be hating the sight of each other . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON That 's a chance I 'll have to take . LAURA HUDSON You think you 're being brave and strong , I suppose . But you 're not . You 're a coward . You 're doing it because it 's the easiest way out . Because you 're afraid people 'll say things about you . You have no backbone . DR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had no backbone when I let myself be talked out of a chance to work with Hocky . And maybe to do something fine someday . But right now I have no choice . I 'm not doing this because I give a good Goddamn what anybody says or thinks ; I 'm doing it because that girl 's life is smashed , and I 'm responsible , and I want to try and help her pick up the pieces and put them together again . He stops short . LAURA is weeping quietly.Oh , Laura ! Do n't ! LAURA HUDSON I knew how you felt about Hocky and I should n't have insisted . I 've been selfish , but it was only because I loved you so much . And I still do . That 's the way I am , George . I ca n't help it . I Enter HOCHBERG , slowly , his face drawn and grave , something tragic written on it . He looks at FERGUSON . p. 135 DR . GEORGE FERGUSON sensing HOCHBERG 'S look:What is it , Doctor ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GEORGE FERGUSON dazed:What ? LAURA HUDSON Oh , God ! DR . LEO HOCHBERG A few minutes ago . FERGUSON looks blankly at DR . HOCHBERG , glances , as if for corroboration , at LAURA , and suddenly starts for the door . HOCHBERG catches his arm and holds it tightly . DR . LEO HOCHBERG softly:There 's nothing you can do , George . Embolism ! Went into collapse ! Died instantly . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON almost inaudibly:Oh ! He sinks down on the bed , his back to them . DR . LEO HOCHBERG George ! LAURA HUDSON Darling ! DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Only a few hours ago she was pleading with me for a chance to live . She was so young . She did n't want to die . LAURA HUDSON Stop it , George ! Stop torturing yourself . Please ! These things happen . It might have happened to anybody . p. 136 DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Could n't you do anything , Dr. Hochberg ? DR . LEO HOCHBERG I tried everything . Caffeine intravenously . Adrenaline directly into the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 're helpless . Forty years I 've spent in medicine and I could n't help her . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Then what 's the use ? What good is it all ? Why go on ? It takes everything from you , and when you need it most it leaves you helpless . We do n't know anything . We 're only guessing . DR . LEO HOCHBERG We 've been doing a little work on embolism getting some results . It 's slow , though slow . Maybe , someday , George . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Someday ? DR . LEO HOCHBERG There is n't a man in medicine who has n't said what you 've said and meant it for a minute  --  all of us , George . And you 're right . We are groping . We are guessing . But at least our guesses today are closer than they were twenty years ago . And twenty years from now , they 'll be still closer . That 's what we 're here for . Mm there 's so much to be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one life is never long enough . He sighs.It 's not easy for any of us . But in the end our reward is something richer than simply living . Maybe it 's a kind of success that world out there ca n't measure maybe it 's a kind of glory , George . Pause.Yes , question as much as we will  --  when the test comes we know  --  do n't we , George ? p. 137 DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Yes . DR . LEO HOCHBERG goes slowly to the door , pauses there:Er we 'll reduce that fracture at ten . Schedule the appendix at three the gastric ulcer immediately afterwards . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Yes , sir . HOCHBERG goes . LAURA turns to FERGUSON . LAURA HUDSON Oh , darling ! I 'm so sorry ! Pause.George , let 's get away from here . Let 's go someplace where we can talk this thing over quietly and sanely . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON No , Laura . This is where I belong ! LAURA HUDSON Yes . Pause . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back from Vienna , if Hocky 'll let you off for a night , give me a ring ! I 'll be around . And maybe someday we 'll get together , anyway . The loudspeaker is heard calling , " Dr. Ferguson ! " LAURA HUDSON smiles wryly:They 're calling you . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON Yes . p. 138 LAURA HUDSON Work hard . DR . GEORGE FERGUSON So long , Laura . LAURA tears herself away , and hurries out . FERGUSON stares after her till she disappears . The loudspeaker calls him back . He goes to the phone , slowly , a bit stunned . He picks up the phone.Yes ? Dr. Ferguson ! Who ? Oh , Mrs. D'Andrea ? Sure ! Your boy 's all right ! Yes . Now , you must n't cry , Mother ! You must n't ! He 's all right ! With his free hand he is brushing the tears from his own eyes and nose , for he is beginning to weep , himself . But you could never tell it by his voice , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , and he 'll be home in a week . Yes he 's going to live do n't cry ! He is still reassuring her as the curtain descends.
