ALL five Starrett brothers were strangely gifted by blood inheritance as builders . The eldest , Theodore , was a genius . With swift strokes of a lead pencil , the artist in him could release on paper for other minds whatever architectural bril  --  liance was shaping itself in his mind . His entire being seemed devoted to the nourishment of that instinct in which his family was so rich , for the creation of magnificent buildings . But his enthusiasms were as shifting winds , blowing hot one minute , cold the next . When I had been only a short while with the Thompson-Starrett Company , Theodore leaned back in his office chair one day and said , " Louis , you are very smart . " I was about to thank him for the compliment , when he added , " I am just wondering if you wo n't prove too smart for me . " I was shocked by the discovery of the company president 's reaction to the work I had been doing . After a minute , I said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been through a mill in which boys learn loyalty . If ever there comes a time when we have differences that can not be reconciled , I will withdraw from the company . " Quickly his face was gleaming with a smile . " That 's fine ; probably nothing ever will occur ? " All of us in the company felt ourselves to be ad  --  venturers . We visioned the cities of America rising to dizzy , gleaming heights . We dreamed of unshaped inventions that would become part of fabulous mech  --  anistic structures we were going to build . So we had need of special aptitudes ; I have mentioned the Dinwiddies ; likewise each of the Starretts was a treasure of his kind . The youngest , Billy , afterward became the builder of the Empire State Building . Three of the brothers , Theodore , Paul and Goldwyn , had spent years in association with Daniel H. Burn  --  ham , the architect who became one of America 's greatest city planners . Ralph had worked as a builder with Theodore for years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was a major force in the George A. Fuller Company , which was giving us our stiffest competition in New York and in Chicago . I came to the conclusion that it would be a master stroke if I could bring Paul into the Thompson-Starrett Company . He was strong in certain directions where Theodore was weak . I spoke about my plan to Theodore . " You frequently cut Thompson-Starrett prices to beat Paul 's figures , and then he cuts Fuller prices to beat you . This is unprofitable , and I am sure it must be distasteful to be at odds with a brother . Paul is a fine executive , able and far-seeing . Would n't it be wise to bring him into this company ? " " Maybe that 's a good idea , " said Theodore . " If I have your permission , I will talk to Paul . " " Go ahead ! " Theodore spoke heartily . As go-between , I found Paul receptive . During the negotiations , Billy , Goldwyn and Ralph hooted me . They said they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were as dogmatic as only brothers can be about such a matter when they said it would not work . The Thankless Role of Peacemaker TEVERTHELESS , I proceeded , happy in the N thought of the future benefits of this double play  --  our own company was to be strengthened enormously and our rival to be correspondingly weakened . I went back and forth between Paul and Theodore until an arrangement seemingly satisfac  --  tory to both had been planned . Then I reduced this to writing . Theodore read it in his office , Paul read it in his . There remained nothing more than the actual signing of this agreement before there was to he a big family celebration . Billy , Ralph and Goldy had approved the agree  --  ment , but they continued to be entirely without faith in my scheme . Despite their pessimism , I arranged an appointment for Paul with Theodore , so they could sign . The sun was shining that morning when Paul strode into our offices . I opened the door of Theo  --  dore 's office for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk . He placed his hands on its glass top and put out his chin , saying by way of greeting , " You seem to have an idea I ca n't run this company without you . Well , you are mistaken ! That is all I have to say to you ! Good morning ! " ? We had a grand supply of enthusiasm in our com  --  pany . On the Sears , Roebuck contract , in Chicago , Bill Dinwiddie performed beautifully . Everything occurred according to schedule , with the result that the building was finished ahead of time . Sears , Roe  --  buck had paid for the job , as we say , out of the till . That is , every thirty days we sent them an account  --  ing of money spent on their behalf in the preceding month , for materials and for labor . Consequently , when the job was done , what remained to be settled was simply the matter of the Thompson-Starrett Company 's fee . The letter of Mr. Julius Rosenwald concerning this was brought to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been audited and found . correct . I enclose our check for $40,000 , repre  --  senting the fee of the Thompson-Starrett Company , as provided for in the contract we signed . " I am ready to admit now that my heart missed a beat or two right then , but I read further : " By a pri  --  vate agreement between us , I was to decide , when the job was completed , whether you were to have the full fee as originally proposed by you . Because your company did what you said it would do , I en  --  close another check for $210,000 . " We had our $250,000 fee ! But there was another paragraph to Mr. Rosen-weld 's letter . He said : " Because you accomplished something beyond our expectations , I enclose also an extra check for $50,000 . ' ? My faith in human nature remained unimpaired . With Mr. Roeenwald 's letter , I fairly ran to the office of Mr. Kelsey . Mr. Kelsey was as pleased as if ho had been my father , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What he stressed was his pleasure that our organization had been able to discharge its responsi  --  bility to Sears , Roebuck to their complete satisfac  --  tion . Even from a cold-blooded point of view , he was right .. This was demonstrated by other contracts that came to us as a direct result , but . Mr. Kelsey really was an altruist . Building for the Rocks fellers AFTERWARD I learned that unfailingly he set aside one-fourth of his income every year for philanthropic purposes . Money never was first in his mind . I know that when his codirectors chided him because he was not receiving his full share of profits , he resisted their arguments . But he was not widely understood . He had a reputation of being difficult to get along with ; this was not justified , be  --  cause anyone could get along with Clarence Kelsey who behaved according to his high standards . Al  --  though I was constantly going to him for counsel , I spent a good deal of time winning him to my point of view . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I asked to have something , to which they were hostile , referred to a. committee consisting of Mr. Kelsey and myself . He challenged me , saying , " You are going to come to my office now and persuade me , eh ? " " Right , " I said . " You want to be persuaded , but not here in the meeting . " It was his habit to turn down almost any proposition made to him , if for no better reason than to bring out the favorable argument  --  ments . Although I failed in bringing Paul and Theodore Starrett into harmony , in g different sort of effort to strengthen the company I was successful . On my representations , Mr. Kelsey and his associates put another $500,000 into Thompson-Starrett . We had powerful friends and we were getting a powerful lot of business . Out in Cleveland we were putting up an office building for the Rockefellers . I remember it was in connection with that job I had my first meet  --  ing with John D. Rockefeller , Jr . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building under con  --  struction was asking us to do something which we felt had not been included in the contract price . I was so sure we were right  --  the other man was equally sure of his position  --  that I appealed to Mr. Rockefeller . Quite promptly an appointment was made . The other man was present . I had with me the estimate sheets , which clearly showed that no provision had been made for the work , but Mr. Rockefeller forbore to look at them . Instead he asked a few questions . " We could not have foreseen that this work would he required , " I said . " There is some ambiguous phrasing in the contract which gives color to the contention of your representative , but a careful checking of these figures will show that we did not allow for the work . " Mr. Rockefeller listened without moving . When finished , he addressed himself to his representative . Are you disposed to challenge Mr. Florowitz 's statement that no provision for this work was made in the estimates ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter . ' ' Is the contract susceptible to two interpreta  --  tions ? " " Yes . " " On the evidence of your answers , " said Mr. Rockefeller , fixing his eyes on the other man , " Mr. Horowitz is right . I rule that the Thompson-Starrett Company be paid for this work . " Since that time I have had a number of opportu  --  nities to observe extraordinary lengths to which Mr. Rockefeller , Jr. , drives himself out of his conscien  --  tious regard for fairness and for all matters of principle . A year or so after that first encounter , we con  --  tracted to make about $40,000 worth of alterations on his house on West 54th Street in New York . A small contract , perhaps , but we had the sense to know that potentially it was enormous . No item of that job was too insignificant to receive his personal attention . No matter what it was he would tele  --  phone us , generally he asked directly for the chief of whatever department would he concerned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he would build a bay window on the second floor , and some additional figures were prepared . I arranged to deliver these to him , but I was not too pleased when I discovered that he had fixed the ap  --  pointment at his office at nine o'clock in the morning . . /7 Rich Man 's Problem I ARRIVED punctually , but he came in about five 1 minutes afterward and apologized for being late : it had been the fault of the railroad . I asked him then why he was willing to come to his office so early on a hot August morning . Why not ten , or eleven ? I suppose there was something in my tone revealing that what really mystified me was the fact that a Rockefeller should so haze himself . " Mr. Horowitz , I made up my mind as a boy that I would not allow the fact that my father was a rich man to alter my idea of my own responsibilities and duties . " I gave him the figures . " Are they all right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tage . He knows that there are no others available for such a job right now . His figure is forty or fifty dollars too high . " I expected Mr. Rockefeller to wave that aside as inconsequential . His family would be returning to the city in another six weeks . They would want to find the alterations completed . After all , what was fifty dollars to a Rockefeller ? But Mr. Roekefeller 's face was stern as he said , " That at once raises the question as to whether the bay window should be built at all . " Jestingly , I asked , " Should not such a matter be determined by Mrs. Rockefeller 's wish ? " " Of course , I will not ignore her wish , but there is something involved here with which I have to deal constantly . I do not want the fact of my father 's wealth to change my outlook from that of other men who do not possess such wealth . " We talked further , and I caught a glimpse of that against which Mr. Rockefeller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contending . He knew there was something pulling at him which might sweep his feet from under him . He was defending himself and his family against being drawn into an unreal world where they would dwell alone . however , on that occasion I asked him to allow me , as one who had no inherited wealth , nor pros  --  pect of any , to interpret the normal point of view . We built the bay window . When the Rockefeller residence was to he built at Pocantico Hills , I went ( Continued on Page 98 ) State Street , New York . " Well  --  er  --  it 's so darn natural and lifelike . " " What ? John , do you mean to say you think I really look like that ? " " Why  --  ah  --  yes , dear . Sure . Why not ? " " Oh , honestly ? My eyes really are n't as terrible looking as that . " " Well , no . Of course , that 's right . I mean he did n't get your eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , did he ? " " I should say not ! And look at the way he 's got my mouth . I look as though I could swallow a horse . " " Yeah , that 's right , Lucy , now that you point it out . He did kind of botch your mouth . " " Yes , and my nose too . Now , I 'll admit I have n't exactly a classical nose , but really it does n't look as big as that , does it ? I do n't see why he again to see Mr. Rockefeller , Jr . We were not housebuilders ; we concerned ourselves usually only with industrial building , but this was a tempting ex  --  ception . There was close to a million dollars ' worth of work in prospect , and besides , we coveted the distinction of putting up the home of John D. Rocke  --  feller . The son was to have charge . In presenting our case , I made the point that if given the contract an a fee basis , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of value for every dollar he spent , but that this might not be true of any other method . " What you say impresses me very much , " he told me . " Come back to  --  morrow at the same time and I will give you my answer . " He decided in our favor and we proceeded . Backing Up a Sates Talk One day our contract department sent over to the Rockefeller office a tabulation of bids for laying up a rubblestone wall . With it went our recommendation that the job be given to a certain Italian . Before long I was asked to come to Mr. Rockefeller 's office . " Mr. Horowitz , " lie began , " do you remember the reasons you advanced in support of your argument that you should be permitted to do this work for my father ? " " Yes , Mr. Rockefeller , " " Do you recall that you made a point of the fact that your company performed certain kinds of work with  --  out resorting to subcontractors ? Do you recall that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of economy and quality ? " " I remember perfectly . I have made similar arguments many times . " " Do you recall that you specified masonry ? " " Yes . " " Is rubblestone a part of masonry ? " " Yes . " " All of this being so , how do you reconcile your recommendation that this work be given to a subcon  --  tractor ? " I explained that the Italian we wished to have do the work could do had to take me in a pose that accen  --  tuated it . " " Yeah , that 's a point , dear . He gummed that up badly , did n't he ? " " Yes , and honestly , if I thought I had all those lines in my forehead I 'd go into retirement instead of getting engaged . Really , did you ever see any  --  thing worse ? He must have painted extra lines in deliberately . " " That 's so . I had n't noticed that either . Pretty bad . Bum picture of you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sure . It 's a terrible picture . I did n't like it the minute I saw it  --  only of course I did n't want to say anything when I knew you 'd gone to all that trouble to have it taken . " " Oh , John , you 're such a dear . Give me a kiss , please . " ? PARKE CUMMINGS . it for less money than Thompson-Starrett ; further , that he had an ex  --  ceptional skill with rubblestone and that he had a following of Italian work  --  men who were the best artisans in that specialized field . I finished my ex  --  planation by saying , " Mr. Rockefeller , this is the exception that proves the rule . We made a careful survey of this situation , and money will be saved by giving the work to this man . " " Your explanation is entirely satis  --  factory . I was afraid I had been in  --  fluenced by an argument that had no basis in fact . " I realized then that he had been dis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sold " by just a lot of selling chatter . It was a wonderful house that Delano 4K. , - Aldrich had designed , and we took a rare pride in building it , but so did the Rockefellers . Mr. Rocke  --  feller , Sr. , began to haunt the job . Always he carried a cane , and he would use it as a wand to wave out of exist  --  ence anything that did not suit him . He ordered so many changes that I ap  --  pealed to the son , " Please , keep your father away from the job ! The work  --  men will learn it is a cost-plus con  --  tract . At least ask him not to give orders for changes to the field staff . Have him tell you , and you tell us . " Office Trouble Young Mr. Rockefeller took my counsel to heart . I think he must have cautioned his father to be careful , be  --  cause changes thereafter came from the office . When the job was finished , I had a heart-warming letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father had a much better house than he would have had without our con  --  scientious interest in all its details . I kept my word with Theodore Star  --  rett when a sharp difference arose be  --  tween us . What happened was that I went to California to install a more ef  --  fective system for accounting control . Bill Dinwicldie , in charge there at the time , had no patience for any new  --  fangled system of bookkeeping . He balked . When I reminded him that I Continued en Page 100 ) ( Continued from Page 813 ) had been made responsible for all finan  --  cial matters , and insisted on his co  --  operation , he telegraphed a protest to his brother-in-law . Theodore Starrett telegraphed back that Bill need pay no attention to me . I was not happy about it , but there was nothing for me to do except resign . I gave no reason . Albert Boardman had become the largest stockholder in the company , and he came after me , urging that I tell him why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " There is no possible good to come out of a discus  --  sion of the matter . " Next , Kelsey got hold of me . " Mr. Horowitz , don't. you think you owe it to us to be frank ? " " Yes , I suppose I do . But when I tell you that to discuss it with you does violence to my sense of right and wrong , I am sure you will respect my position . " Then Kelsey came back with a fresh argument . " You are wrong about this . We put $500,000 into Thompson-Starrett be  --  cause we believed you were going to be there to keep an eye on our money . " My feeling that I could not place my  --  self in opposition to Theodore Starrett was more strong than I can say . After all , it was his company ; he had created it and it bore his name . Moreover , his great technical skill had been impor  --  tant to it . It meant somewhat less to me than it did to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone say or think that I had come into the busi  --  ness intending to undermine him . However , after about three months , under considerable pressure from Clar  --  ence Kelsey and Albert Boardman , I told my side of the trouble ; Theodore had been telling his pretty steadily . The result was that a , committee was appointed to investigate the cause of my resignation . The verdict was unani  --  mous that Theodore had been at fault . I was invited to return . I said I would come hack only if a situation was cre  --  ated which gave me freedom of action and at the same time protected the financial status and the dignity of Theodore . Furthermore , I said that the entire organization would have to join in a request for me to come back . The three brothers of Theodore joined in that request , and so I returned as vice president and general manager ; Theodore became chairman of the board and Albert Boardman suc  --  ceeded him as president . Six Merchants From Philadelphia My great concern then was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embittered because he had hap  --  pened to precipitate the difficulties between his brother-in-law and me . Bill 's value to the company was im  --  measurable . I made it my business to show him Iliad no feeling against him . We two and our families became close friends . The act of getting a building con  --  tract rarely was a simple transaction ; quite often success was bought with a campaign lasting for a year or more . When I say that the negotiations pre  --  ceding the erection of a big building were sometimes as delicate as the steel that went into them was tough , I find myself thinking of the Gimbel job . Ernest R. Graham , the Chicago architect , was the one who revealed to me that Gimbel Brothers had become ambitious to have a department store in New York City . They had a thriv  --  ing store in Philadelphia and another in Milwaukee , but Graham told me the New York project had been conceived as one to become a gigantic merchan  --  dising establishment . Naturally , I was excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would re  --  quire a building to cost between five and six millions of dollars . However , Graham explained that a vague and mysterious set of circumstances had arisen that was preventing consumma  --  tion of the merchants ' scheme . There were six Gimbel brothers , and the chief was the eldest , Jacob , a bearded bachelor who was customarily clad in a Prince Albert coat and wore a boutonniere . Next to him in age and authority was Isaac , an extraordinary merchant . He was to become the executive in charge of the New York store . Bernard is his son . After Isaac came Charles , whose genius was the merchandising of women 's wear . To  --  day his son , Adam , is the head of Sak 's Fifth Avenue . Ellis . Gimbel was the family 's treasurer . Then there was Dan , a bachelor , who was connected with the Philadelphia store , and Louis , associated with the Milwaukee store . I think I never had fewer than four of the Gimbel brothers in any conference I had with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to be de  --  cided , the six were present . Separately they were diffident , almost timid ; to  --  gether they were as a band of lions . They were punctilious , and through years of close association , there had developed among them an almost tele  --  pathic understanding . The Silent Ballot Whenever a decision was to be made in one of our conferences , there would be an exchange of intelligence among the brothers . They seemed to have signals , but what these were never he-came apparent to me . There were meaningful glances , perhaps , but hardly as much as a nod . Whatever the means of this silent form of communication , when the circuit had been completed , when the brothers had been in this way secretly polled , invariably Jacob was the spokesman who announced their decision . Always he stood up be  --  fore speaking . Sometimes he would de  --  part from custom by addressing him  --  self forthrightly to one of his brothers , asking , " What do you think , Mr. Isaac ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answer , although it might come from a counte  --  nance alert and merry , would be given as silently as one from Harpo Marx . What we had to consider in the first of those meetings was a qualified op  --  tion which the Gimbel brothers had obtained from the owners of a highly desirable site in New York City  --  the one they now occupy . This option gave them the right to lease a building which the owners of the site were to erect if  --  if the owners could borrow the money . The owners were the Hud  --  son &; Manhattan Railroad Company , which owned the site the Gimbels cov  --  eted . Underground it was intended to develop the Manhattan terminal of the subterranean railroad . The building site was possessed originally by the Hudson &; Manhattan Company only because of its importance to them in their railroad operations ; Gimbel Broth  --  ers meant less than nothing to them . But the six Gimbel brothers , being smart merchants , were well aware that the sidewalks about such a building as was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commuting hu  --  manity as it went out of New York to New Jersey and Long Island at night , and again when it returned in the ( Continued on Page 103 ) ( Comffmsod from Pug . 1011 ) morning . The site was right on the path to the Long Island Railroad 's and the Pennsylvania 's terminal . The development of the Hudson &; Manhattan Railroad Company 's ter minal real estate into an income-producing property was being handled for it by Harvey Fisk &; Son . Shortly before I became interested , this house had informed the Gimbels that it felt it would be impossible to borrow the money to put up a building suitable for a department store . I got from the Gimbels statements of their earnings in Philadelphia and in Milwaukee . When I had studied these , I came to the conclusion that there ought to be no trouble whatever in borrowing the money . That was what I'undertook to tell Pliny Fisk . Pliny Fisk was a man difficult to see at his office in 62 Cedar Street . When the stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it closed , he vanished . So I began to stalk him as if he were a specimen of big game , and the water hole to which I tracked him night after night was the enticing caf ? of the Holland House . That was the resort of many epicures ; it was especially fa  --  vored by Chicagoans in New York . Pliny Fisk arrived there usually be  --  tween eleven o'clock and midnight . Always he was charming to me , but as we grew better acquainted , he was more and more frank in revealing that the real difficulty with that far-from  --  iron-clad option of the Gimbels was that he had experienced a change of heart . " Now , Mr. Fisk , " I would plead , " you gave the Gimbel brothers an op  --  tion and you are a man of your word . " But the money , Horowitz ! " " Look ! I know that for such an enterprise as they wish to develop , I can borrow the money . " " Please , Horowitz , do n't try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They Stood " It is well known that Pliny Fisk does not play the game that way , " I would repeat . Eventually my per  --  sistence along this line of attack seemed to overwhelm him , and he said he would go through with the deal , making every legitimate effort to borrow the money to put up a structure appro  --  priate for a department store . Pos  --  sibly his surrender was helped a trifle by the fact that the Gimbels had taken my advice and filed against the prop  --  erty in question , as a means of further validating their option , a legal instru  --  ment called a ? is pendens  --  a warning to all that a lease was pending . Nevertheless , we were still a long way from having the deal completed . The six Gimbels kept having flashes of inspiration concerning improvements on the building they wished to have , but concerning the rent they were will  --  ing to pay their minds were as un  --  yielding as year-old concrete . I recall in particular one conversation when three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I exclaimed , " A parcel chute ! But why have you said nothing about a parcel chute until now ? Arrange  --  ments have been made for just so much money ; we are not dealing with a rubber band that can be stretched ; Thompson-Starrett Company are not magicians ! " I tried to find some gleam of reason  --  ableness in the faces of the Gimbel brothers , but they were listening to my protests with their eyes half closed , as if further to guard themselves against any arguments I might make . To each protest I uttered , their spokesman said , " A parcel chute or we do n't sign . " I wailed , " It begins to look as if you would never sign I However , I will try to get for you a parcel chute . " Yet when the parcel chute had been cajoled out of Pliny Fisk , they had thought of something else . Once it was an objec  --  tion to the use the Hudson &; Man  --  hattan Company was planning to make of a portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isaac Gimbel who spoke to me from Philadelphia over the long-distance telephone . " We ca n't have their trains running through our store , " he said . " I appoint you a committee of one , Mr. Horo  --  witz , to go down to Mr. Fisk and tell him what I am saying . " .8 Difficulty a Day " All right ; I 'll tell him what you say . " By that time Pliny Fisk and I had become pretty good friends . I went to him and said , dutifully , " I am appointed a committee of one to tell you that Gimbel Brothers are spending $650,000 a year for rent , so they may sell merchandise , and the selling of merchandise will be interfered with if you persist in running trains through the basement . " " Now then , Horowitz , I appoint you a committee of one to go hack to Isaac Gimbel and tell him for me that our only purpose is to operate a rail  --  road successfully . We did not buy the land in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought it for the use of our railroad , and what we have considered leasing to him is merely a by-product , that part of our land on which the railroad will not func  --  tion . Tell him that for me . " I think there was never a day that I did not meet some fresh difficulty . I was the one who had to compose all conflicting interests , to conquer preju  --  dices , to soothe anger . If I had not done as I finally did , I think that all of us would still be arguing . What I did was to call up Isaac Gimbel in Phila  --  delphia and say , " I want you to get all of your brothers and any other rela  --  tives who have a voice in the matter to come to my office in 49 Wall Street day after tomorrow at nine o'clock . Have your lawyers . We will have ours . I am asking Mr. Fisk to come with Mr. Oakman , the president of the rail  --  road . " Then I telephoned Graham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a showdown and asked him to come East for the final meeting . " When that meeting breaks up , either the papers will be signed , or else , so far as I am concerned , they never will be signed . " All of us attended the conference with our lawyers ; for the Gimbels the principal lawyer was Mr. Werner , then partner of Judge Cardozo , now a mem  --  ber of the Supreme Court of the United States . There were several sheets of typewriting covered with the list of debatable items , and invariably as one of these points was raised , there would he a cry from the Gimbels , " We wo n't sign . " Red-headed Ernest Graham was a marvel of diplomacy in negotiations of the kind . In an engaging way he com  --  pelled the parties to deal first with those things on which there was agree  --  ment . He said , " We will return to these points of dispute later . " None of us went out for luncheon or dinner . At intervals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those moments of relaxation there were sudden outbursts of " We wo n't sign . " Actually it was eleven o'clock at night , when we had been in session fourteen hours , before the papers were signed . Appropriately , the first one to write his name was bearded Jacob Gimbel ; then Isaac and the others in turn . They signed jointly and as individuals . Even today I enjoy kidding my friend Dan Gimbel about the happen  --  ings of the following day . He came to my office early and said , " You know the front part of the basement ? The part the railroad has reserved as a baggage room ? " " Yes , I know the place you mean . " " We ca n't give it up . " Dan Gimbel spoke in such a tone of passion as I have heard David Warfield use when he was playing in The Music Master . " You have given it up . " " We ca n't give it up ! Isaac must have that as a place to sell baby shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per  --  mitted the railroad to reserve that area . It is mentioned specifically in the agreement . " " Unless we get it for Isaac 's baby-shoes department , " said Dan , and paused to inflate himself with the means thunderously to voice a threat , " we wo n't sign . " " Let me remind you , Mr. Dan Gim  --  bel , that you and your brothers signed yesterday . " " It makes no difference . We wo n't sign anyway . " A Building Finished Too Soon The most curious part of all was that I actually succeeded in getting the rail  --  road management to concede a large part of what the Gimbels asked ; they rearranged their platforms for the sake of the baby-shoe department . But how Pliny Fisk swore as he consented ! Next we had to settle upon the com  --  pletion date of the budding the Thompson-Starrett Company was to erect . I addressed myself to the assem  --  bled Gimbels , asking , " When do you want this store ? " Glances were exchanged by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " July first . " " You astonish me , " I said . " Most New York merchants in July and Au  --  gust are wishing there was some way to put their stores on ice . They would like to close them during the vacation season . Are you sure you want the store completed by July first ? " There was another silent exchange of thoughts , and then Jacob answered me again , " We are sure ; by July first . " I was puzzled for a little , and then I said , " I suspect that you really want the store on September first , but are saying July first in order to provide against such delays and disappoint  --  ments as you have experienced in con  --  nection with other new buildings . Please take me into your confidence . Let me know what you really want . Otherwise , you are liable to have the store on your hands July first . " There was movement among twelve Gimbel eyes ; then Jacob said , " We want the store completed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I had been a djinn warning against as unwise use of magic , but they were not to be changed , even though I reminded them that for every day we were fin  --  ished ahead of a specified date , we were to receive from the railroad a bonus of $1000 . I explained further that this bonus was something the railroad planned to pay out of rent the Gimbels // ... would have to pay from the day of corn pletion . Again Jacob announced their verdict ; July first .. I said , " Very good , " Two interesting things happened in connection with the erection of the building . First , Pliny Fisk called me . " You maneuvered me into building a department store when I wanted a hotel . Now I want you to do some  --  thing for me . Charlie Schwab is com  --  ing to my office , and he wants the order for the steel . You come here and talk to him about it . " I was glad to do that . At our meeting , Schwab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sections are new and I want you to introduce them . I will name you a favorable price . " The Bethlehem section to which he referred was a steel column rolled in one gigantic piece instead of being built up by riveting numerous small members . " If the architect is satisfied , " I said , " and if you make the price right , we will buy your steel . " The trade we made was at a price of thirty-two dol  --  lars a ton . Schwab went to Europe after our meeting and was gone about six weeks . During his absence , the steel market broke ; prices came down two or three dollars a ton . Shortly after Schwab returned , he telephoned me for an appointment , and when we were together he said , " Things have been happening to the steel market since we talked . I suppose we will have to retrade the Gimbel job . " " Retrade ? Why , I do n't see that at all . If steel had gone up , I would have expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I propose to stand by mine . I have no right to do anything else ; and no inclination . " He was aston  --  ished , and said it seemed to set a new standard for the contracting business . Giving Wings to Steel Afterward we gave Charles Schwab 's company the steel order for another job . Early one morning he telephoned to ask if I would stop and breakfast with him at the St. Regis on any way downtown . In those days I was keep  --  ing myself trained for business as if I had been a prize fighter . By sunup I was on a horse 's back trotting around the bridle paths of Central Park . Conse  --  quently , I had to explain that I had begun to digest my breakfast , but that I would en  --  joy watching Mr. Schwab eat his . When we were to gether , he said : " I wanted to tell you how much we appreciate your business . Because of the way you people feed your orders , it is a pleasure to give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to show you my appreciation . " " Mr. Schwab , " I answered , " the way I want you to show appreciation is to continue to make deliveries of steel to us as promptly as in the past . That is the controlling reason for us to do business with you whenever the price is right . You remember you were sur  --  prised when I stuck to a bargain with you on the Gimbel job ? " " I remember . " " Well , some day I am going to get square with you . " " I hope you do , " he said . When it came time for Mr. Schwab 's company to build an office building in Bethlehem , Pennsylvania , we , of course , got the job . The other matter that I referred to was in connection with the fabricating of the steel on the Gimbel job . At that time , Schwab 's company did not have a fabricating shop , and so the steel was shipped from Bethlehem to the Staten Island plant of Milliken Brothers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waddill Catchings . He was the one with whom I dealt . I said to him , " You will have to keep to a tight schedule to deliver the steel as we want it , but you can do this if no time is wasted . If it becomes necessary to incur extra costs through overtime or through other ways that force you to spend more than is necessary on a leisurely job , we will pay you a bonus . " But I did not drop the matter there : two and sometimes three times every day I was after him about the steel . Making Business Good Will Ours was not the old-fashioned con  --  tractor 's way of discovering that ma  --  terials were going to be delayed only when they failed to arrive at the job . We kept our own inspectors at the plants of those with whom we con  --  tracted for materials , and the minute difficulties developed we took action . So with Catchings there was no time when he could excuse delay by blaming it on Bethlehem . " Never you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You at  --  tend to fabrication and I 'll see that the steel comes to you as fast as you can work on it . " If he fell behind , I was immediately on top of him . However , we were liberal to the point of gener  --  osity , so that he not only hurried but hurried with eagerness . Twenty years afterward , when Gold  --  man , Sachs were planning to have their own high building in Pine Street , I went . down to see if I could persuade Walter Sachs to give my company the job . Finally he said , " I would like to do business with you , but I must ask Mr. Catchings for his views . " By this time Waddill Catchings had become an influential partner in Goldman , Sachs . Walter Sachs left me , and then , in a few minutes , into my presence bounded Waddill Catchings , hands outstretched , voice roaring , " Will Goldman , Sachs have Thompson-Starrett erect its build  --  ing ? Nobody else in the world ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forgotten the way I had ex  --  tended the power of our organization right into his foundry in order to get speedy delivery of steel for the Gimbel job . However , neither did the Gimbals forget . When it was certain we were going to complete the department-store building by July first , the Gimbel clan rallied at my office . They were in a mood of despair . Through Jacob they propounded to me a question : How could a reasonable person expect them to pay rent for July and August on a store it would be insane to open before Labor Day ? Since it would ruin them to open the store any earlier certainly they would not . Jacob sat down . Never did anyone say with more vehemence than I , " I told you so . " I recalled to them that I had pleaded to be taken into their confidence . " Yes , " acknowledged Isaac , rising to his feet , " hut we were afraid to say Labor Day was the date we wanted , for fear you would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tell him not to charge us any rent until September . " " I should ask Mr. Fisk to give you over $100,000 ? That is an awkward errand for me , surely ! And after all that I said on the subject of completion too . " The Gimbals were , they assured me , quite in my hands . " We did not know you then as well as we do now ; we did not know what a dynamo you were . " They knew when to flatter . I arranged a meeting . After so many months of association with the brothers , I had begun to appreciate what a ter  --  rific force of money , of merchandising knowledge and of courage was involved in the opening of a new department store . Millions of dollars ' worth of goods had to be moved into the place and attractively displayed ; thousands of employees had to be recruited and trained for their work ; and the people of the city had to be excited to high pitch of curiosity concerning this new store . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intrusted only to generals , but by this time I knew that as merchants all the Gimbels were generals ; and there was one , Isaac , whom I regarded as a field marshal . But these were matters of small moment to Walter Oakman and Pliny Fisk . They wore their faces grimly tight as we gathered . A Penalty for Punctuality Jacob , with one hand inserted be tween the breast buttons of his Prince Albert coat , proceeded to explain how he and his brothers were being strained to the breaking point to pay clerks and to concentrate in warehouses millions of dollars ' worth of merchandise . Then came his climax : " All because the con tractors fooled everybody by finishing on a scheduled date ! " Actually , he made Thompson-Starrett seem blame worthy ; yet in the face of Pliny Fisk there was not one relaxed muscle . Then I spoke , saying that all my contracting experience had prepared me only with excuses for being late ; I had no excuse for be  --  ing on time . How  --  ever , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York busi ness of Gimbel Brothers would be pay  --  ing 5650,000 annually for rent . I was thereby trying to dwarf the two months ' rent that the Gimbals were unwilling to pay . I finished abruptly by announcing that Thompson-Starrett had decided , at a meeting of its board of directors , to waive its bonus and expressed the hope that the landlords would be generous enough to forgo the rent for July and August . And they did ! A short while before this I had been elected president of Thompson-Star  --  rett . Years afterward , Jim Dinwiddie confided to me that it had been due largely to the manner in which I had conducted the Gimbel job that the organization had decided to accept me for its leader .
