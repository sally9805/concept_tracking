Ever since roly-poly Howard Hopson was caught lobbying against the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 , nothing so delights official Washington as seeing his vast Associated Gas &; Electric Co. caught off-base . SEC is trying to delist A. G. &; E. stock from the New York Curb Exchange because of alleged " false and misleading " statements in its prospectus . Last week its investigation turned up a choice tidbit which SEC promptly speared . <P> In a list of its salaries submitted to SEC , A. G. &; E. recorded paying one Ben Grey $55,000 for eleven months ' work in 1937 . Promptly SEC raised an astonished eyebrow . Who , it asked was this mysterious person and what service had he performed for A. G. &; E. to earn such a fat fee ? Last week A. G. &; E. Vice President Fred F. Burroughs appeared unhappily before SEC to explain . Fidgeting , he told SEC Lawyer Lewis Dabney that Ben Grey was a short man with a blond mustache whose job had been " to mix with the right people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ben Grey was not a lobbyist . <P> Ben Grey may not have lobbied for A. G. &; E. but in Washington he is considered a lobbyist . A steely-eyed gentleman of 45 , he is one of that populous capital group who appear to know everything about everybody but tell nothing about themselves . He has been variously a newshawk , an ambulance driver for the A.E.F. in France , an adviser to the coal interests when they drew up their NRA code . <P> His first public-relations job was for President Harding , who wanted a brewing scandal in the Veterans Administration hushed . About 1928 he hooked up with the Democratic Party , now would like to have it believed he stands in well with Franklin Roosevelt . He is a trustee of the National Home Library Foundation , brags he has an entree to the liberal group surrounding Louis Brandeis . He wears thick-lensed glasses when he reads , plays the piano , has two children and a handsome apartment on Manhattan 's Fifth Avenue . He calls almost anyone he meets by his first name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he calls them " Dear . " <P> This week SEC will call Ben Grey to explain himself . At last week 's hearings A. G. &; E. 's Burroughs told Interrogator Dabney that among the men on whom Ben Grey reported was Lewis Dabney himself . <P> " What did he tell you about me ? " asked Mr. Dabney . <P> Snapped Witness Burroughs : " He told me you were out for publicity and that you were issuing news releases to improve your own position . "
