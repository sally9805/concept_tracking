Former King Alfonso XIII of Spain last week had the curious but pleasant sensation of becoming a citizen of his native country . He was made so by a decree of Generalissimo Francisco Franco himself . To the 52-year-old Alfonso , now living in Italy , were restored ( so far as Insurgent Spain could do so ) the rights he lost after he fled the country in 1931 and was " tried " in absentia before the Republic 's Parliament . The Republic found him guilty of high treason , confiscated his properties , ordered his immediate arrest should he ever be caught in Spain again . <P> Meanwhile Don Alfonso , last of Spain 's Bourbon monarchs , having prudently invested tens of millions of pesetas in foreign bonds and stocks while he sat upon Spain 's throne , did not go hungry in exile . Citizen Bourbon will regain little now save two homes , one on the fashionable beach at San Sebastian , another at Santander ( both in Rightist Spain ) . Should the Rebels take Madrid he would again become the owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total recovery of property to about $3,500,000 . The crown properties ( castles , palaces , etc. ) are still considered State property by Rightists and Leftists alike . More important , however , an opening has been made , possibly for Alfonso 's return to the throne in the event of a final Franco victory , more likely for a crown for the healthier of Alfonso 's two living sons , 25-year-old Prince Juan .
