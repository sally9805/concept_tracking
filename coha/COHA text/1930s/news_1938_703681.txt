txt This week in New York , next week in Chicago , James A. Farley as Chairman of the Democratic National Committee Is holding two of the most impottant political meetings that have convened since 1936 . The meetings ate composed of Democratic leaders from about two-thirds of the states and they are discussing the prospects for 1940 . Out of the New York discussions , where leaders from 21 Eastern and Southern States wet e present , has emerged part of the widespread present talk of Secretary of State Cordell Hull for the Pi esidential nomination . From these general Democratic parleys , too , has come the suggestion of Mr. Farley himself as Vice-Presidential candidate . Many of the hard-boiled old-line Democrats at the New Yolk meeting , and presumably those who will gather at Chicago as well , have for tome time been open in their criticism of New Deal policies . They did not like the President 's intervention in primary campaigns this summer , and their influence ' was in no small degree responsible for the failure of the purge . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in the closest sort of touch with them for some eight years now . Therefore his influence in the coming 20 decisive months is certain to be very great Straws in the Political Wind In Washington today , strange uncertainties and cross-currents prevail . Here are three items of alleged information , each divulged by its source with a purpose , which reveal the back-stage maneuvers now going on : 1 . One of the President 's closest left-wing advisers said a few days ago that he expected five more departures from the Cabinet within the next few months . He mentioned , in order of departure , the following : Harry H. Wood-ring , Secretary of War ; Claude A. Swanson , Secretary of Navy ; Frances Perkins . Secretary of Labor ; Daniel C. Roper , Secretary of Commerce ; and James A. Farley , Postmaster General . This informant is supposedly " in the know , " as all readers would recognize if his name could be mentioned . But that is not to say that his information is accurate . Rather , it reflects wishful thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeeze-play . " Rumors about Cabinet departures are spread deliberately by those who want to blast certain officials out of their posts . The source , of course , is the New Deal left wing . 2 . Several close confidants of Mr. Farley have declared recently that he . is seeking to get " independent " of . the President , does n't know where he stands , and is investigating two private jobs he may accept . They say he is interested in the Hull presidential boom , and is attracted by the possibility of the vice-presidential place for himself . Reason Seems Plain His reasons are obvious . This line of information , too , is for a purpose . Its motive , primarily , - is to force President Roosevelt to ? back likr . Farley anew against the Hopkins - Ickes - Corcoran group . The more talk there is about Mr. Farley leaving , the more valuable he may seem to the President . So he and his friends lend color to stories of his departure and wait to see what the White House says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has been mentioned as a presidential possibility , told a friend before he made a couple of speeches this week , that he had to make the speeches vague and general . He did n't know , he said , what the White House " line " was going to be ; what direction policy would follow ; so he was sticking to platitudes for the time being . This item is more candid than the other two ; it accurately reflects the perplexity of a faithful follower of the President , waiting to see in which direction to turn . In the meantime , Mr. Farley is making hay with the corporate organization of the Democratic Party . The political gossipers are filling Washington with their whispers . Presidential slates are made and unmade overnight . The Cabinet is taken apart and put together again with incredible facility . And , seriously speaking , the trend of national policy in the , coming important months is in the crucible ,                    @
