In each of four dusky projection rooms at 1600 Broadway last week , a small group of schoolteachers , pencils poised over marking blanks in their laps , sat watching the antics of Mickey Mouse , an erupting volcano , travelogs , Bobby Jones measuring a fairway . Part of an ambitious project that has been going on since May and will continue until September , they had seen and judged by last week some 1,500 motion pictures and expect to see several hundred more . What they propose to accomplish by this labor , undertaken for an advisory committee of Will Hays 's Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America , Inc. , is the first complete report on the educational possibilities of the U. S. commercial cinema . <P> The idea of using movies in classrooms is as old as the movies themselves . Thomas Alva Edison thought that the movies would be more important as an educational than as an entertainment medium . Nevertheless , of the 10,000 " educational " films now catalogued and available in the U. S. the overwhelming majority are dull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest professional producers . Eastman Kodak Co. has manufactured since 1926 some 200 silent films on historical and scientific subjects , Electrical Research Products Inc. a scanty 40 sound films . Most Hollywood producers think that the effective market is too small for profit . Of the 300,000 schoolhouses in the land , only 10,000 have 16 mm. projectors and of these less than 700 are equipped for sound . With too few films to encourage new projectors and too few projectors to encourage new films , education by movie has never gotten off the ground . <P> Purpose of the present committee , financed by a $50,000 grant from the Hays office and manned by such potent schoolmen as Johns Hopkins ' President Isaiah Bowman , President Karl Taylor Compton of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Director Mark May of Yale 's Institute of Human Relations , is to break this vicious circle by opening the vaults of Hollywood for school use . Four years ago broad-beamed Educator May and Dean Howard Le Sourd of the Boston University Graduate School set out to experiment in this direction by extracting morally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ De Bra , a soft-spoken Hays lieutenant who was once a teacher himself , they constructed a series called Secrets of Success . Educator May got the Rockefeller General Education Board to contribute $75,000 to the Progressive Education Association to test Secrets of Success next fall in a number of selected classrooms . Last week Experimenters May and De Bra were both on hand at 1600 Broadway , both confident that their reviewers have uncovered further unsuspected educational wealth . How schools and producers ought to divide the expense of editing and remaking the films for school projectors and setting up a national distributing agency , and what rentals should be charged , the present exploratory committee was not prepared to say . <P> One reviewer last week approved a Mickey Mouse as follows : " Mickey Mouse can teach children because he has a child 's point of view . Both a mouse and a child must look up at a door knob , and both see other things from similar perspectives . ' '                @ @ @ @ @
