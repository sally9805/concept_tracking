Four games played in 1935 laid the 1934 collegiate football season away to rest in history . <P> Rose Bowl At Pasadena , Calif , the biggest crowd ( 85,000 ) packed a stadium decorated with bunches of flowers to watch the game between Stanford and Alabama . Alabama 's Halfback Millard ( ' ' Dixie " ) Howell gained 273 yd . His longest run ( 67 yd. ) made one Alabama touchdown while his phenomenally accurate passes , mostly to End Don Hutson , paved the way to two more . Swamped by three touchdowns and a field goal in the second quarter , Stanford marched bravely to a touchdown in the third but still had no defense for the Alabama passes that scored again in the last . Alabama 29 , Stanford 13 . <P> Sugar Bowl At New Orleans , a huge sugar bowl containing two little girls dressed in the colors of Temple and Tulane , was dragged onto the field to be greeted by a Father New Orleans in cavalier 's costume . Neatest play of an exciting , well-played contest came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Temple kickoff , ran to the right to draw tacklers , then threw a lateral pass to his teammate Monk Simons who scampered 75 yd. for a touchdown . Two more Tulane touchdowns in the last half outweighed Temple 's early lead , 20-to-14 . <P> At Miami , the stadium was called the Orange Bowl . Five thousand spectators in white flannels and beach clothes watched Bucknell , bothered by sore feet and colds in the head , romp through the University of Miami , 26-to-0 . <P> East v. West Crack players selected from Western and Eastern college teams played the tenth annual all-star benefit game at San Francisco . Irvine ( " Cotton " ) Warburton 's 72-yd. run to a touchdown was the most spectacular play of the game . Outplayed in the first half . East came back gamely but not quite enough in the second . West 19 , East 13.
