Dr. George Gallup recently polled U. S. voters on U. S. Labor . He found that 78% preferred A. F. of L. 's William Green to C.I.O. 's John L. Lewis . His conclusion : " The majority of American voters , particularly in the upper and middle classes , fear the power of Lewis and the C.I.O. " Last week the frightened classes had a look at the man and the thing they fear . <P> John L. Lewis and 518 other delegates to a constitutional convention assembled in Pittsburgh to bury the three-year-old Committee for Industrial Organization . <P> In its stead they erected a permanent organization , whose full official title is " Congress of Industrial Organizations ( CIO ) . " Man of Power . John Llewellyn Lewis does not expect to be seen clearly in his time , but he does expect to be measured in history . Seemingly undismayed by C.I.O. 's poor showing in last fortnight 's elections , Mr. Lewis last week measured himself as a man of power . Said he : " My strength is only the strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of authority to represent it , but when they send their grant of authority , then my strength is multiplied and multiplied in progressive ratio , and it becomes a strength to be reckoned with in the realm of affairs in our democracy . " Man of Politics . Labor 's multiplied power man has let it be known that the strength of himself and multitude remains at the service of Franklin Roosevelt and New Deal , but not necessarily at the service of Franklin Roosevelt and Democratic Party . To drive home this distinction , John Lewis took as his text Boss Frank Hague of Jersey City , N. J. , vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee . <P> Federal Judge William Clark recently dusted off Mayor Hague by specifically enjoining him to let C.I.O. organizers ( and other dissenters from the established Hague order ) speak , solicit members , carry placards and otherwise exercise their Constitutional rights in Jersey City . Politico Lewis declared it high time to throw all Hagues out of the Democratic Party , to arrange a genuinely liberal political alignment of CIO in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolutionsuch as has become routine at conventions of C. I. O. affiliatesChairman Lewis squelched him . Thus Mr. Lewis had left wide open the question of C. I. O. al legiance in 1940 . The convention then went on record against all amendments to the Wagner Act , and against diversion of Federal funds from social services to Rearmament ( but did not oppose Rearmament as such ) . It demanded more Relief , more Housing , more and better Planning in the name of greater production , greater employment , greater consumer purchasing power .
