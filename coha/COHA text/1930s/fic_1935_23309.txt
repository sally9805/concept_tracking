THE HUNCH A STORY BY A. H. Z. CARR N o ONE has ever called me supersti- tious or even tender-minded . In the past when people have told me at second hand about mysterious phenomena and occult forces ( " I did n't see the spirit myself , exactly , but I know the fellow who did " ) , I have generally been a litle bored . But since my experience with the man called Lcg-'n ' - half I have sometimes  --  well , wondered . These are the facts . I was driving through suburban Westchester one warm Sunday afternoon with a girl . She was  --  is  --  a very pretty girl . Possibly I was less concerned with the car and the road than with her profile ; we were not married then . At any rate , while we were going through Ryeneck , one of Westchester 's wealthy towns  --  you know the type : wide streets , stone and stucco mansions for the upper middle-class , Tudor-style apartment houses for the middle middle-class , dingy wooden cottages for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  while we were in the commercial district I passed a traffic light  --  a red light . I advance in excuse that the light was badly situated and partly obscured by some construction work , although the crosswise stream of traffic should have warned me . However , seeing no signal , I inferred that here was one of those every-man-for-himself lightless intersections that used to make motoring exciting . The prospect of wait-ing indefinitely while New York-onwheels returned home did not attract me ; and at a propitious moment I charged across the road . Blasts from horns , remarks reflecting on my parentage and intelligence , and requests for data on my eyesight and my destination rose all about us . The girl said , " Oh . I see the light now . You passed it . " Simultaneously a large policeman advanced from nowhere and yelled , " Pull over to the curb , you ! " I did . This policeman was elderly , and life , no doubt , had thwarted him ; he was bitter and vengeful . I have always believed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admission of one 's iniquities goes farther than a claim to know the chief of police , unless one happens actually to know him . But what I intended to be a disarming apology evoked in this instance only the little pad of summonses and a sarcastic , " Smart guy , hey ? " Stimulated by a deep-rooted aversion to the payment of fines , I pointed out that although I had been at fault , the violation had been ( a the traffic light . To this the policeman replied while examining my licenses , " Trying to lie your way out of it , hey ? " and his tone was more than usually offensive . Had I been alone it would never have occurred to me to resent what a policeman said , lest worse befall . I suppose the girl 's presence made my ego unduly sensitive . At any rate I replied something to the effect that I did not like his manner . He said , ' ' Oh , is ' at so ? Tough guy , hey ? " Having committed myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , I was not tough . I said that I merely wanted him to be civil . He said , " Shut up . " Up to this point I had been astonished and delighted at my own temerity ; the summons seemed cheap at the price . But now , like so many inexperienced orators , I was carried away by my own eloquence . I pointed out that he was a public servant ( a statement that does not ring cheerfully in the ears of an American policeman ) paid by the community 's taxes to exercise a little intelligence , although , I implied , the community should have known better . I proclaimed my determination to make an issue of this case . I told him that he would regret his insolence , his arrogance , his discourtesy , and so forth . These were , of course , empty mouthings . The speech was very soothing to me , but not to him . His complexion was red to begin with ; it became apoplectic now ; and breathing hard , he made some notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do me no good in court . While this was going on I was dimly aware that several men were watching us from a sleek black touring car parked at the curb some fifty feet away . I doubt whether they overheard the dialogue , but the pantomime was sufficiently clear . They grinned broadly ; and one of them winked sympathetically at the amused girl next to me . The policeman finally handed me the summons , and with an attempt at dignity , I drove away . When we cameabreast of the other car , a man who had been standing at its side detached himself and called , " Heyl " I stopped . He was a heavy-set , powerful man , round-faced , small-featured , swarthy , with a greasy skin ? a South-Italian , I should guess . His costume consisted of a pair of shapeless gray trousers , a dirty yellow " windbreaker , " and an old cap . When he moved out into the street limping , I instinctively glanced at his feet . One leg was perhaps three inches shorter than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a grotesquely high heel to make up the difference . He said , casually , " Get a ticket ? " I said , " Yes . " He said , " Aw , ' at 's only or Scanlon . Let 's have it , ' n ' I 'll fix it fuh yuh . " My first idea was that I had stumbled onto a new racket , in which a policeman gave out tickets which his associate down the street then " fixed " for a consideration . But there was an air about this man , a kind of placid confidence , that did not fit into this view . He was not sly or furtive . He stared at me steadily and waited for my answer . I said , " What do you mean , you 'll fix it ? Why should you ? " He said , " Whut duh hell 's ' uh difference s'long ' s it 's fixed ? " I said , " How do I know you can fix it ? " He looked surprised . " Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen of ' em ev'y week . " " How ? " I asked . " How yuh think ? " he retorted with a trace of irritation . " I know all ' uh right guys . Christ , fella , I 'm tryin " uh do yuh a favuh . " " Yes , " I said doubtfully , " but suppose you did n't fix it . That 'd leave me in a fine spot , would n't it ? " " But I 'm gon na fix it , " he repeated impatiently . " Hell , ev'ybody here knows me . Henry Milano , ' cy call me Leg-'n ' - half . I run all ' uh rackets roun ' here . Ask anybody . " He did not say this boastfully , but with a quiet authority , as a statement of fact . I believed him , But I could not understand why he should go to any trouble on my behalf . While I was hesitating , he said , " You f 'm Brooklyn , ai nt cha ? " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , " he said , " I thought yuh was fm Brooklyn , f 'm yuh license plates . " I shook my head . He continued , " I thought maybe you was one of Augie " ? I think he said Geronimo ? " Augie Geronimo 's boys . Yuh know Augie ? " I had never heard of Augie . But while Leg-'n ' - half  --  to give him the name by which I always think of him ? was talking I became aware of several things . Scanlon , the policeman , had watched the scene for a moment and then moved away with a discomfited air too authentic to be simulated . The young men in the car were gesturing at the girl alongside as if to say , " Go ahead . Do it . " I no longer seriously doubted Leg-'n ' - half 's good intentions ; but his motive remained incomprehensible . Then a theory occurred to me . I was wearing a new hat , an excessively jaunty affair into the purchase of which an unscrupulous salesman had intimidated me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinister appearance . Could this fact , together with a sunburned skin , an unfortunate assemblage of features , an unpleasant attitude toward the police , and a presumptive Brooklyn license number have suggested that one of Augie 's boys was taking his mull out for a drive ? Was Leg-'n ' - half extending the courtesies of the town to a fellow-racketeer ? I could think of no less implausible explanation . Obviously , I saw , a connection with this Augie should not be too quicklydisowned if I wanted to avoid the trouble which had visited me . Accordingly I said with what I hoped was the proper inflection , " Well , I do n't know Augie personally , but one of my pals knows him very well . " I heard the girl in the car choke , but Leg-'n ' - half seemed relieved . He said , as if everything was settled , " Deh y'are . Let 's have it . " I handed him the ticket . Perhaps there was a trace of doubt still in my manner , because he said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If yuh worried , just gim me a call so I wo n't fget . " With that , he crumpled the ticket , stuffed it into his pocket , and began to limp away . A few flakes of gratitude were crystallizing out of my bewilderment . I said weakly , " Thanks very much . " He looked round and said , " Okay . " I got the impression that he was waiting for something , and an uncensored impulse made me ask , " Do I owe you anything ? " He answered curtly , " Nah . What the hell . " And this time with finality he turned his back . We drove off while the men in the other car laughed . For a while the girl and I were amused and excited ; but after a few hours the incident dropped out of our consciousness . I forgot to telephone Leg-'n ' - half ; a week elapsed , and I had not heard from the Ryeneck police , and the episode began to slip into the mists of the faintly unreal . About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consult recent copies of the metropolitan newspapers for the purposes of an article on which I was engaged . Glancing down a page , my eye caught a brief item which read : " Ryeneck , July 8th . Late last night Henry Milano , reputed Westchester racketeer , was shot outside the Helicon Restaurant by two unknown men who effected their escape by automobile . Milano was wounded in the abdomen and chest and was taken to the Rye-neck hospital . His assailants , with whom he exchanged several shots , escaped unrecognized , but the police believe that they are members of a Brooklyn gang who have lately been attempting to ' muscle in ' on Milano 's territory . ' Milano 's condition is grave . " My encounter with Leg-'n ' - half had taken place on the sixth . He had been shot the next night . I was vaguely sorry ; and I dismissed a faint uneasiness about my summons , with the reflection that time would tell . But a new worry arose to plague me . Suppose this Brooklyn gang was that with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summons . Might not Leg-'n ' - half 's friends regard me with suspicion ? I remained unmolested , however , by gangsters or police , and my fears gradually wore thin , until a day about six months later , when while riding in the subway I became aware of another strap-hanger who was watching me intently . I turned and saw Leg-'n ' - half . As soon as our eyes met he forced his way through the crowd and took the strap next to mine . " Yeah , " he said without any preliminaries . " I thought it was you . " His manner struck me as being alarmingly enigmatic . " How are you ? " I stammered . " Okay , " he said . An embarrassing pause ensued . " 1 read in the newspapers that you got shot , " I said , frantically wishing I could think of something else to talk about . " Yeah , " he said . " Right after you came along . " My imagination began to conjure up discouraging possibilities . If in Leg-'n ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attack on him the immediate future was not inviting . I wanted to protest my innocence , but I felt that anything I said might be interpreted as a consciousness of guilt . With desperate caution I began , " The papers said some fellows from Brooklyn did it . " He answered significantly , " Yeah . ' Ey got theirs las ' month . " I was not troubled about the fate of the fellows from Brooklyn but I recall being a bit confused about the proper etiquette for the occasion . Did one offer congratulations ? I mumbled something vague and hurried on . I said , " I 've never thanked you enough for fixing that ticket . " He shrugged . " ' At 's okay . " I decided to clear the matter up once and for all . " You know , " I said jocularly , " you asked me whether I was from Brooklyn  --  whether I knew some fellow  --  Augie something ? " His eyes flickered , and I plunged into awkward explanation . " I was kidding when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really never heard of him , but I thought maybe you would n't fix the ticket if I said I did n't know him . " He smiled slightly , for the first time . " Sure , I knew yuh was lyin ' , " he said . " 1 jus ' ast yuh tuh make sure yuh was n't one o ' Augie 's guys . If you 'd ' a ' bin , you 'd ' a ' said yuh neveh hoid of him . Deh was a couple of ' em around just ' nil day b'fo ' , and I was n't takin ' no chances . I was n't fixin ' no tickets fuh none o ' his guys . " This revelation of subtlety startled me , and all my former curiosity returned . " Look here , " I said , " if you did n't fix the ticket for me on account of  --  well , why did you fix it anyway ? " His face became somber and he was silent for a moment . Then he said , " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see ? I was in kind of a spot wit ' Augie , see , ' n ' I was lookin ' fuh a hunch . When I see you and yuh dame ahguin ' wit ' Scanlon , right away I get a hunch . I say to the boys , Dat guy 's gon na gim me luck . I 'll fix it fuh him , ' n ' I 'll tell Augie tuh ' " ? he repeated what he had told the boys he would tell Angie to do . Then he added , rather bitterly , " Well , I fixed ' uh ticket okay , but a hell of a lot o ' luck you was . A jinx . " " I hope not , " 1 said , trying to smile . " Not any mo ' , " he answered promptly , with an air of having considered the question . " ' S soon as I see yuh just now I had a hunch it was okay . ' At 's why I come over tub talk tufi. yuh . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need some hick . Well , I 'm countin ' on yuh to give it tuh me dis time . " There was a challenge in his voice . " I 'll do my best , " I said idiotically . " Okay , " he said , as if satisfied , There was a long and difficult pause . Then he added , " Well , here 's wheh get off , " turned abruptly as the train pulled into a station , and limped onto the platform , where he stopped and looked at me with an expressionless face . Without quite knowing why , I was perturbed , hut my wife , to whom I related the incident , laughed , possibly at the thought of my bringing good hick to anybody . In an effort to create a little concern on my account , I pointed out that lie was an avowed murderer , whose annoyance might easily carry a fatal connotation . But the detective stories and gangster movies to which my wife is addicted have made murderers too familiar to be very terrible . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is give the poor man what he wants . Try concentrating . " The next morning at breakfast I turned a page of my newspaper to find a small headline staring at me : " Gangster Killed , Slayer Wounded In Gambling House . " The story read : " Last night , a little after nine o'clock , Henry Milano , whom the police describe as a racketeer living in Ryeneck , New York , shot and killed Pasquale Vincenti , of 1258 West End Avenue , who was discharged from Sing Sing only last month . The shooting occurred at Jack Maguire 's Club at 10th Avenue and 57th Street , raided by the police as a gambling dive on several occasions . Milano was seriously wounded in the right shoulder , but whether by Vincenti or another is not known . At City Hospital he refused to give any information to the police . " The report went on at some length . It was quite clear to me that Leg-'n ' - half 's superstition , derived from heaven knew what obscure Mediterranean origins , would hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an absurd feeling of responsibility for what had happened to him did bother me . I could not get him out of my thoughts . A childish but nonetheless oppressive notion that I had been singled out to play a mysterious role in the life of this man defied every reference to common sense and seemed to adumbrate some impending calamity . Although my wife continued to dismiss my fears with regrettable lightness , I could not help hoping that Leg-'n ' - haIf would go to jail for a long sentence . I watched the newspapers closely . In a month or so I read that he had proven to the district attorney 's satisfaction that the killing had been in self-defense , and had pleaded guilty to a technical charge of manslaughter . Sentence had been deferred . After that I saw no reference to the case . Under the pressure of my own affairs , the matter slowly slipped out of my mind . Then , one evening about eight months after the previous encounter , my wife and I stopped for dinner in a Westchester roadhouse . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuffle of feet behind me and a gasp from my wife . I turned and saw him standing back of my chair . He was thinner and paler than the last time I had seen him . I looked for a clue to his feelings in his face , but it was as impassive as ever . When he spoke , however , his voice had an ominous undertone . For the first time I sensed the genuinely dangerous nature of the man . " Listen , " he said to me , " I wan na talk tuh yuh . Come on oveh to duh bah . " Before I could reply , my wife said , smiling pleasantly , " Why not talk here ? I 'm not in the way , am I ? " He looked at her for perhaps ten seconds , then said , " Now , I guess not , " and dropped into a chair at our table . " Listen , " he resumed , " You jinxed me . " My wife said to me reproachfully , " I do think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which Leg-'n ' - half acknowledged with a nod . " I remember your kindness very well , Mr. Milano , " said my wife . He cleared his throat , and turned to me again . " Listen , " he said , " I jus ' got sprung on parole yestiddy . Duh las ' six mont 's I bin thinkin ' about you . " " I was mighty sorry , " I said , " to hear about that business  --  you know , the time we met on the subway ? " He paid no attention to my words . " Funny , " he said thoughtfully , " my hunches a'ways clicked up t ' I met you . Twice yuh jinxed me . I thought for a while you was doin ' it on poipus , but when I look atcha I du n no . I keep gettin " uh same hunch I had b'fo ' . " He broke off , and there was a little silence . Then he looked at me from under his heavy lids and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me " . . . and stopped again , with a glance at my wife . She was no longer smiling , and I did not like the situation in the least . I said , " You know I 'm not jinxing you . How could I ? " He merely looked at me , and I hastened to drop the rational argument . " Well , then , " I said , " why should I ? You were decent to me up in Ryeneck . I would n't want to see you in trouble , would 1 ? It 's just a coincidence . " He passed his fingers slowly across his lips . " Yeah , " he said . " Only how do I know ? " My wife started to speak , and he interrupted . " Listen , " he said . " Yuh need n't be scared . If I was gon na do anything , I 'd ' a ' done it . It 's like I say , when I look atcha , I du n no . I keep gettin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I says t ' myself , Deb 's duh jinx . I ca n't rub him out here , so I better beat it b'fo ' he sees me . ' Den I 'm not so sure . I keep thinkin ' maybe duli jinx is oveh . I keep feelin ' you 're luck if I can make it come . " I shook my head and then hastily reversed the motion to a nod . He said , " Listen , guy . I do n't have nothin ' against yuh . But I do n't stand for no more jinxes . Twice is enough . Three times is out . T'night I 'm goin ' back to Ryeneck to split wit ' duh guys that 's been lookin ' after things while I bin away . Maybe dey 'll split easy , and it 'll be okay . Maybe it wo n't . It 's up to you . Get it ? " I nodded again , vaguely . " If you put the jinx on me again , " he said simply , " it 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get it ? Lucky ! " With that he rose , in his usual abrupt fashion , and left us . For the first time I saw my wife frankly alarmed . She wanted me to go to the police . I objected , however , that to do so would be a direct invitation to disaster ; whereas if events were left to chance , Leg-'n ' - half 's luck might turn . Certainly the law of probabilities owed him  --  and me  --  something . Besides , what could I telt the police that would not sound Iike the timidities of a neurotic ; and what could they do ? But Leg-'n ' - half bad said , " Three times is out . " I did not like the sound of that . The next morning my wife and I scanned every column of our newspaper . We found nothing . I was plunged into a state of unresolved suspense . Had I been confirmed as Leg-'n ' - half 's jinx ? Or had the boys " split easy " ? The incredible fact grew upon me that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street , I might quite casually , quite abruptly , be shot to death . This was not a pleasant thought to live with . And although for a while nothing happened , there can be a kind of terror in nothing happening . At first my wife and I buoyed up our spirits with wishful thinking . We told each other that Leg-'n ' - half 's affairs had probably prospered , failing reports of a shooting in Ryeneck ; and that even if something had gone wrong the man could not be fool enough to hold me responsible . But neither of us had any faith in this theory . We had seen and heard Leg-'n ' - half . The truth is that the obvious insistence of circumstance on turning what should have been a joke into a tragedy had an air of predestination . My wife denies that she expected my murder hourly ; but I know that I began to entertain a sort of resigned conviction that I was doomed . I found excuses for not leaving our apartment building ; and I astounded a strange insurance solicitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine , by taking out a policy . It was after three days of morbid tension that Leg-'n ' - half reappeared . He came while my wife and I were at the dinner table . We had been trying to talk of inconsequentialities , when she rebelled , saying , " This Suicide Club atmosphere is getting on my nerves . Let 's go away for a while . Let 's go to the country . " I had been secretly toying with the same notion , but naturally , I did not want to admit it . I said that I would not be forced out of my home by a gangster 's threat ; a man owed something to his self-respect ; what were we coming to ; and so on . My wife is not easily deceived by heroics , especially mine . She said , " Nonsense . We ca n't go on like this , looking up and down the street every time we go out of doors , jumping at every noise . And we 're so helpless . " With the nonchalance expected of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended to kill me he 'd have done it by now . " At this point the doorbell rang . I answered ; we had previously agreed that Leg-'n ' - half would not dare to call at our apartment , under the eyes of doormen and elevator boys . I had imagined several versions of an encounter with him , in all of which I came off with credit and alive ; but as I opened the door and saw him standing there with another man I could not speak or move or slam the door ; I was paralyzed . He said , " Hello , guy . " I muttered something that I did not understand myself . He said , " I come to tell you it was okay . " " Okay ? " I gasped , and he nodded . I remember that my knees literally trembled with relief as I caught the implications of his words . " That 's great , " I managed to say . The thought crossed my mind that it was extremely decent of him to have taken the trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Duh boys come through okay . " My wife , with a look of panic , had joined me at the door , and I said hurriedly , " Mr. Milano just stopped by to say that everything went off all right the other night . " " Oh , " she cried , beaming at him . " I 'm so glad . How nice of you , Mr. Milano , to let us know . " He cleared his throat , and said , " ' At 's okay . " And then , with sudden bravado , " My hunches a'ways bin good . ' At 's how I got wheh I am . " " I 'm sure of it , " my wife smiled . He turned to the man with him , a big , tough bruiser , and said , " Beat it a minute , Pete . I wan na talk tuh dis guy alone " ; and the man strolled down the corridor . " Listen , " Leg-'n ' - half said to me , lowering his voice . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puffin ' fuh me . " " No , " I said , cheerfully making conversation . " Of course not . I 'm no jinx . " He paused for a moment before replying , as if considering my remark , and I began to feel vaguely uneasy . Then he said , " Listen . I 'm f'gettin ' about ' ose uddeh times . My hunch is , you 're duh guy I been waitin ' fuh . " " Waiting for ? " I repeated stupidly . He said , " I bin lookin ' fuh a good-luck guy . I used tuh have a lucky kid but he died on me . Now I know yuh okay I 'm all set tuh make a couple o ' deals I bin thinkin ' about fuh a long time , see ? " I merely stared at him , and he went on . " I 'm makin ' a deal wit ' a couple o ' big shots downtown next Satiddy night , an ' I ai n't takin ' no chances . I 'll need plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tub see ) th on my way down . About eight o'clock , you be here . " This was not a question ; it was an order , given by a leader to his henchman . I said , bewildered , " But look here . . . " He broke in impatiently . " I ai n't got time now . if yuh know whut 's good fuh yuh , guy , yuh wo n't try no funny stuff . You 'll pull fuh me . You be here . " There was no mistaking his seriousness . He waited for an instant , but as I did not renew my objection , henodded , and said , " ' At 's right . You pull fuh me , guy , an ' I 'll take care o ' yuh . " With this he turned and started to limp away . But after a few steps , as if not wishing to fail in politeness , he glanced back , made a short jerky motion with his hand , and said , " G'night . " I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife closed the door , and we looked at each other . The bitter unfairness of it all was what I resented most , I think . I felt rather like Job . Why should I , among millions , have been chosen by Leg-'n ' - half to bear the responsibility of his dangerous fortunes ? And I wondered again , was there in truth some unfathomable human relations between us that he could sense , and I could not ? Was I mascot , if not jinx ? Could there be unrecognized forces of nature that might bind together two lives in an apparently magical pattern of luck or adversity ? My wife , however , is a realist . She wasted no time in idle reproaches to destiny , or in philosophical excursions . While I was dismally contemplating the agonies of uncertainty that would fill my brief future before its inevitable , violent end , she went to the telephone , where I heard her calling a real-estate dealer of our acquaintance . The result was that after a few days of unbelievable effort , on the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call , we moved into a small house in the country , about a hundred miles from New York . The place is not entirely satisfactory : but one can not expect too much when one rents on such short notice . I do not know what has happened to Leg-'n ' - half . We Ieft no forwarding address , and I think I am safe from him . In my more optimistic moments I hope that he is dead . But every now and then I get the quite ridiculous feeling that if he is dead , I may somehow  --  I do n't know how  --  he to blame .
