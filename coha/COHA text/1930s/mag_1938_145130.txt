There are only a few major raw materials of which the U. S. does not have its own supplies . Such are rubber and tin . <P> Such also is silk . Last week , however , the U. S. awarded Patent No. 2,130,948 to the late W. H. Carothers , former chemist for E. I. du Pont de Nemours &; Co . <P> The apparel trade , which had for some time heard rumors of the new Du Pont product under the name of Fibre 66 , believed it might prove the first practical process for manufacturing synthetic silk entirely from chemicals . <P> When rayon appeared it was at first hoped that it would completely replace silk as raw material . It never did because , among other reasons , it lacked silk 's elasticity ( a rayon stocking , for example , wrinkles instead of clinging to the knee and sharp-eyed women maintained they could tell the difference at a glance ) . The new fibre ( made of complex nitrogen compounds , among them cadaverine* ) , as silky as silk itself , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filament , and in some sizes has 150% greater tensile strength . Its elasticity is such that it can be stretched up to 700% of its normal length . So far no one has attempted to produce it commercially . Hence chemists do not know what it will cost , though it is estimated it will be somewhat dearer than rayon , may cost even as much as silk . If it could be manufactured inexpensively , however , it seemed likely to threaten silk 's last big U. S. market-the hosiery industry , which last year turned $73,230,000 worth of raw silk into women 's stockings . <P> * Cadaverine is a poison formed by dissolving proteins and putrefying animal tissues .
