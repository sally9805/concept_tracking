Pygmalion ( Gabriel Pascal ) is Bernard Shaw 's famed comedy about the transformation of a Cockney flower girl into a lady by a phonetics expert ; the simultaneous transformation of the phonetics expert into a human being by the flower girl . As the first authorized , full-length screen version of a play by the world 's No. 1 living dramatist , Pygmalion could scarcely have avoided being important . It could easily have avoided being good . As produced by Gabriel Pascal and acted by Wendy Hiller and Leslie Howard , it is not merely good but practically perfect . <P> Pygmalion delighted both critics and cinemaddicts in England , where it has been playing for seven weeks . It is likely to delight U. S. critics and cinemaddicts . More significant , it pleased its own author . Heretofore adamant in refusing to sell cinema rights of his plays ( with the exception of two shorts : How He Lied to Her Husband , Arms and the Man ) , Bernard Shaw not only helped write the script for Pygmalion but agreed to let Producer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon start work on Caesar and Cleopatra . <P> How Producer Pascal acquired possession of the world 's richest mine of entertainment material would be as good a story as how the heroine of Pygmalion acquired the poise of a duchess but for the fact that it is utterly implausible . A squat , fervent , irascible Transylvanian , ex-farmer , cavalry officer and economist . Producer Pascal 's best previous contribution to cinema was Franz Lehar 's Frederica . His reward for the ripple of applause which it aroused in 1932 was a succession of minor jobs producing shorts . <P> In 1935 , after spending six months in Hollywood doing nothing , Pascal left in disgust . He arrived in London and out of a clear sky called Playwright Shaw , whom he had never met . Pascal said he wanted to produce Shaw 's plays . <P> Practically every producer in Hollywood has tried to buy the rights to Bernard Shaw 's plays at one time or another . Playwright Shaw 's most famed reply to such offers was that which he made to Sam Goldwyn . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his work would be treated not as a commercial venture but as art , Shaw answered , " Mr. Goldwyn , you are interested in art and I am interested in money . " <P> When Playwright Shaw asked Pascal how much money he had , Pascal replied : " Fifteen shillings and sixpence-but I owe a pound . " As much delighted with this effrontery as with Pascal 's obvious admiration for his work , Playwright Shaw gave him a pound to pay his debts , agreed to the experiment . With Shaw 's approval for his project he had little trouble getting as much as he needed . He assembled about $250,000-less than Hollywood spends on most quickies . He hired Screenwriters W. P. Lipscomb and Cecil Lewis to write a scenario , rented a studio and set to work . <P> Said Playwright Shaw : " I am going to teach Americans one of the things they do n't know-how to put English drama on the screen . Every word will be written by me . Not the least regard will be paid to American ideas , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
