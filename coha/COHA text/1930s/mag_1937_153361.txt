" Has the Government started something it is not going to finish ? " angrily at Nanking last week boomed massive " Christian General " Feng Yu-hsiang who , born a peasant and still a peasant , delights to shame more refined Chinese officials when he can . There was last week no getting around the fact that the Nanking Government had sent out orders to begin executing on New Year 's Day Chinese caught selling , buying or smoking opium , and that beginning New Year 's Day nobody had been executed for that crime ( TIME , Jan. 11 ) . This , according to the Christian Marshal , was outrageous . With Old Testament fervor he demanded that the Chinese Government , many of whose members are decidedly New Testament , finish up with wholesale death what they had started . Over 100,000 addicts had been slated for execution in Peiping alone . <P> " No addicts are entitled to further delay -I urge immediate executions ! " shouted Feng , banging his peasant fist . " I myself have a cousin who , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit at the age of 62 . Others can do likewise if they are determined ! " As the Generalissimo and Premier of China , Chiang Kaishek , was not answering the telephone or reading his mail or telegrams during the week , the Christian Marshal could only browbeat lesser officials and they timidly tried to appease him with just a little death . After Feng had stormed for hours , Peiping police produced a half-frozen individual by the name of Lu Ju-hsin , saying they had caught him on a bicycle with 60 ounces of narcotics . <P> His death was personally ordered by the local military satrap , General Sung Cheh-yuan . Shackled behind a motor car , the prisoner was dragged through the streets of Peiping while buglers blew their loudest and policemen beat up anyone who tried to use a camera . End came near the Peiping garbage dump . There 10,000 people watched the frost-nipped Lu Ju-hsin as he was forced to a kneeling position . Up behind him stepped a snappy Chinese soldier , placed the muzzle of a pistol against the back of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Recently-kidnapped Premier Chiang rested in quiet retirement this week and his recent kidnapper , young Marshal Chang Hsueh-liang , although pardoned by the Nanking Government ( TIME Jan. 11 ) was still under such extremely heavy guard last week that it was difficult to say whether or not he was in custody . <P> He was once more the " guest " of Banker T. V. Soong ( TIME , Jan. 4 ) and last week played around the Nanking Country Club golf course accompanied by soldiers carrying eight submachine guns " in readiness . " The city of Sian . scene of the kidnapping , was reported in unconfirmed dispatches to have been taken over by a Chinese Communist army , and jittery Japanese continued to fear that the Premier 's fantastic kidnapping and its fantastic sequels were largely a blind to distract world attention from a drawing together of Chiang 's China and Stalin 's Russia for united war on Japan .
