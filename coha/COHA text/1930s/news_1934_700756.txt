txt Despite the ravages of drought and reports of great losses caused , the combined cash income of American farmers this year will exceed that of 1933 by about 20 per cent , or more than $1,000,000,000 . Present official estimates are that farmers will receive from sale of all crops and livestock this year a total of $5,450,000,000 . To this will be added benefit payments for acreage control under adjustment programs of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration , amounting to $500,000,000 , of which $150,000,000 was paid in the first half of this year . Theo resulting total of $5,950,000 , - 000 compares with a total cash income to farmers in 1933 of $4,868 , - 000,000 . Although prepared by Federal economists , the estimate of 1934 income can not be attributed to any government agency . This is because the separate items going into the total must be approved by experts specializing in the various phases of agricultural production before being officially given out . The estimate , however , is the one which is to be submitted for approval and it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fortnight by the Department of Agriculture . Emergency Sales Included In arriving at the 1934 figure , it has been assumed that proceeds from the sale of all crops and livestock in commercial channels during the last half of the year will be about $86,000,000 more than farmers received during the corresponding period last year . Total income during the latter period was estimated by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics at $2 , - 836,000.000 , so that the comparative figure for the last half of 1934 would be $2,922,000,000 . To this is added $100,000,000 expected to be received from the emergency sale to the government of about 7,000 , - 000 cattle and calves and 5,000,000 sheep at an average of $13 and $3 a head , respectively . The figures for anticipated liVestock purchases by the government are admittedly conservative and the estimate of income from this source would be increased to the extent that purchases are larger . This is one of the items which may be changed before the 1934 income estimate is officially announced . Addition of the tentative estimate of $100,000,000 to receipts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1934 leaves the total at $3,022,000,000 . When the $350,000,000 expected to be paid out in benefit payments.is added to other income during the last half of the year the combined result is $3,372,000,000 . Combining this with the $2,578 , - 000,000 received during the first half of the year gives the $5,950,000,000 figure , Marketing Heavier Than ' Usual . It is assumed by government agronomists that the sharp reduction in farm products available for marketing as a result of drought will be slightly more than offset by correspondingly sharp increases in prices for such products . In an analysis of the price situation for August the Bureau of Agricultural Economics said : " The sharp rise in prices for farm products during June and July has been accompanied by heavier than usual marketings and farm income has increased more than seasonally . " It Is probable , however , when the liquidation of livestock is over and the shorter supplies from the 1934 crop begin to move to market in volume , that farm marketings will be below average , but price advances will tend to offset the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the level of farm income . " The decline in business activity during July was accompanied by some decline in employment and payrolls , but it is expected that the consumer demand for farm products during the remainder of 1934 will be greater than during the same period in 1933 . " This should tend to hold income from farm marketings during the last half of 1934 at about the same levels as in 1933 . " This anticipated trend in marketings and prices is considered in the estimated increase of $86,000,000 in farmers ' cash income from sales in the usual commercial channels during the last half of 1934 over the corresponding period last year . It is thought that marketings of grain will bring about $41,000,000 more than during the last half of 1933 and that the increase in cotton prices during the period will give growers in the neighborhood of $13 , - 000,000 more . The abundance of most fruits and vegetables , however , is expected to result in a decline of $18,000,000 in income from this source from July to December under the same period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from all field crops in the last half of 1934 is estimated at $36,000,000 more than during last year 's corresponding period . A similar increase of about $50 , - 000,000 in farm income from all livestock and products is expected . Receipts from sales of meat animals is thought to be about the same as during the earlier period , but an increase in income from dairy products is looked for . An anticipated increase of be ' tween $10,000,000 and $20,000,000 from sales of poultry and eggs is expected to be offset by a corresponding decline in the proceeds of sales of wool , leaving the net increase in income from all livestock and products at about $50,000,000 during the last half of 1934 as compared with the corresponding period of 1953. 87 Products Are Included , Government estimates of cash income to farmers are based on the marketings of thirty-seven of the more important agricultural products normally making up about 90 per cent of all cash income received by farmers . Although the total of the twelve monthly estimates on which the calculations are partly based is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm production , they are not strictly comparable . Slight differences between the two estimates occur because the annual estimates of cash income are the total income from the crops sold or to be sold from the production of the year , while the monthly estimates are based upon marketings , regardless of when the crops were produced . The estimate for this year is still far below the cash income to farmers in the years preceding 1931 , however , as shown from the following figures for 1924-30 inclusive : 1924 .. .59,785.000.000 1930 ... $8,451,000,000 1925 ... 10.324.600.000 1931 1.22 : .12:22 1926 9.993.000.000 1927 ... 10,016,000,000 1933 4,868,000,000 1928 ... 10,289,000,000 1934 ... 5,950,000,000 1929 ... 10,479.000,000 More than half of the $1,082,000 , 000 increase over last year is credited by officials to the administration 's agricultural adjustment and drought relief programs . Of the total increase , $500,000,000 consists of benefit payments for acreage re- I duction expected to be disbursed before the end of the year , and $100 , - 000,000 of government purchases of drought-stricken livestock , Although gratified by the improved showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of drought damage had been exaggerated . There is general agreement that , without the $525,000,000 , relief program , coupled with the I alleviation of human distress previously inaugurated , many farmers from the Dakotas to Texas might face starvation .
