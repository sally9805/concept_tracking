SCIENCE <P> One balmy spring night last week two men were alone in a big brick building on the Princeton University campus . Physics Professor Rudolf Walter Ladenburg , 53 , and Research Associate Cletus Clinton Van Voorhis , 50 , were so interested in their atom-smashing experiments that they had come back to the physics laboratory to work after dinner . For bullets they used neutrons . The neutrons were knocked out of beryllium by alpha particles from radium . The beryllium and 200 milligrams of radium sulphate , worth $4,000 , were in a metal tube . One of the scientists started to solder a loose cap on the tube over a flame . The cap blew off . Some of the radium compound spurted into the faces , nostrils and mouths of the two men . Instantly they felt burns . <P> No one knew better than Ladenburg and Van Voorhis that radium poisoning rots flesh &; bone , finally kills . Terrified they ripped off their clothes , wiped their skins with wet cotton . To find specks they could not see , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a staccato clicking in the presence of radioactive emanations ( TIME , Aug. 5 ) . <P> Next day the room was roped off and four assistants went over everything with radium counters , recovered most of the burst tube 's contents . Meanwhile the two victims took repeated blood tests . Said Chairman Joseph Raycroft of the Health Department : " We can not state now just what danger Professor Ladenburg and Mr. Van Voorhis are in.
