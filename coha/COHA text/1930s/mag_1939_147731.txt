The Christian Front is an " antiCommunist " organization of followers of the Rev. Charles Edward Coughlin . It is also the name of a loose federation of anti-Semitic societies , with an estimated 100,000 members . Some of these Christians ( like the German-American Bund , the Christian Mobilizers ) , have actually been tut-tutted by Father Coughlin. * Last week the Brooklyn Church and Mission Federation , representing nearly all the Protestants in that strongly Coughlinite borough , sounded off against the Christian Front in no tut-tutting terms : <P> " In view of the report that the so-called ' Christian Front ' is strenuously endeavoring to increase its forces by inviting Protestants into its membership , we are compelled to warn Protestant people against accepting such invitations and overtures . ... No organization or group of individuals fostering such evil propaganda which has resulted in numerous acts of violence in our city has the moral right to call itself Christian . . . . Any group using the name of Christ for any purpose foreign to His character is either ignorant of Christian fundamentals or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> * In an open letter in Social Justice last week , Father Coughlin said that 90% of the Christian Mobilizers were " fine people , " but its leadership was allied with the Bund . Therefore , said he , ' ' as much as I need $128 , " he was returning a check for that sum which had been raised for him by Christian Mobilizers in The Bronx .
