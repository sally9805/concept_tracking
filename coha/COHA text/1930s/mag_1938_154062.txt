The 54th Attorney General of the U. S. last week held his " farewell " press conference . He reviewed his labors , which began with an opinion on the President 's power to call a bank holiday , written personally , in penciled long hand , in the Library of Congress while his chief 's first inaugural was in progress March 4 , 1933 . He recalled the hot legal battles of AAA and NRA ; the building of the FBI from a sleuthing unit to an armed force with powers of arrest and a sharp-toothed Federal crime code behind it ; the improvement of U. S. prisons , notably the creation of Alcatraz . With special pride he pointed to the new rules for civil procedure in Federal courts ( TIME , Sept. 26 ) , which the American Bar Association had for 25 years tried in vain to obtain . Of all his monuments , these rules , he said , were his favorite . <P> Though he will not actually leave office until after Congress meets in January , Homer Stille Cummings then thanked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all round with tears in his eyes . <P> When Montana 's grim-jawed old Senator Tom Walsh , newly wed , died just before the New Deal was inaugurated , Homer Cummings of Stamford , Conn , was slated to be Governor General of the Philippines .

Mr. Cummings returned at once and the President announced his resignation , accompanied by public exchanges of mutual cordiality . <P> The President was not ready to tell who the next Attorney General would be . Observers guessed it would be Solicitor General Robert Houghwout Jackson . They also guessed that before Thanksgiving 's turkey hash was all consumed there would be more changes in the Cabinet . <P> *Before she sailed for London , President Roosevelt asked Mrs. Cummings to give him a private showing of herself in court gear , complete with three white plumes .
