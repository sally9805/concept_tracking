Nearly a decade ago a New Yorker cartoon by Carl Rose showed a mother urging broccoli on an emancipated child whose response became immortal : " I say it 's spinach-and I say to hell with it . " To designers , spinach is not only a humble green but a trade word for any superfluous decoration . From these two sources came the fitting title of a book published this week by Manhattan 's No. 1 dress designer , petite , smart , feline Elizabeth Hawes. * To Designer Hawes , " fashion " is superfluous decoration . In the process of telling how she shrugged it off she gives the dress trade a sane and entertaining dressing down . <P> A Vassar girl who found out about chic during apprenticeship with Paris copyists , " Babe " Hawes made no study to write her book , told only about what she had run up against or figured out in business . This was considerable . First U. S. designer to challenge Paris successfully , first to show U. S.-designed clothes in Paris , first foreign designer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabeth Hawes believes in " style , " a quality in a dress which enables its purchaser to wear it happily for three years . Style changes about every seventh year . On the other hand , the fashion world is a dizzy merry-go-round of superficial changes which enable mass manufacturers to sell cheap , ill-fitting , flimsy garments by the million . <P> Elizabeth Hawes thinks this is already a complete anachronism , that the time has come and that she herself has proved that U. S. manufacturers would do better each to hire a real designer and specialize in something the public wants , instead of herding frantically after the French or one another . <P> Last week Fashion Critic Hawes was still pouting at her publishers because they refused to illustrate her book with drawings she had had made by one of her favorite artists , the New Yorker 's Helen Elna Hokinson . She vowed she was going to write another book , one that no publisher could consider too serious for Hokinson illustrations . Far less concerned with the incident than the fiery Hawes , shy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was last week mainly interested in a delightful mass of raw material-a mob of inimitably shaped Garden Clubbers who descended on Manhattan 's annual Flower Show . One of the few New Yorker satirists whose style has resisted fashion for a decade , Hokinson 's workshop is her bedroom , in a neat little apartment on Manhattan 's Beekman Place . On her living-room wall are two glossy , old-fashioned American landscapes which she picked up in Connecticut last summer for $7 . She calls them her van Goghs . <P> *FASHION IS SPINACH-Random House ( $2.75 ) .
