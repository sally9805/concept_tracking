One of 18 sticks of dynamite wired to his engine had gone off . That " accident " and a whole bumper crop of anti-labor sluggings , shootings and gaggings made Harlan 's rich coal veins throb with miners ' blood . Last year , the La Follette Civil Liberties Committee tried applying a tourniquet ; but bloody Harlan proved hemophilic . <P> Kentucky-born Leane Zugsmith 's Summer Soldier is about Harlan County . She calls it Chew County . Seven slightly screwy liberals join a committee to investigate conditions in Chew .
