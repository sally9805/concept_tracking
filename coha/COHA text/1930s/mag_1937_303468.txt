At Immingham Dock , Humber River , in the north of England , the little freighter Backworth last week loaded $10,000 worth of sugar , flour , fruit and dried salt fish for starving Basques in Spain 's besieged Bilbao . More than one-tenth of the cargo was paid for by David Lloyd George who seldom misses a chance to make political capital of anything . Down to the dock hurried Britain 's Wartime Prime Minister to wring Captain Russell of the Backworth by the hand . <P> " I too am a Basque ! " cried he , shaking his white mane . " Marshal Foch was a Basque ! The Welsh and the Basques are the same race . " <P> Off to run the Bilbao blockade went the Backworth with the blessings of most Britons behind it . Not Lloyd George or even the Back-worth was responsible for the sudden pro-Leftist switch in British opinion last week but a group of blustering captains of rusty little British freighters . While the British Cabinet worried over Generalissimo Franco 's blockade , the captains , three of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food remained marooned in the French harbor of Saint-Jean-de-Luz . First to catch the public eye was Captain David ( " Potato " ) Jones , part-owner of the Marie Llewellyn and nicknamed for his cargo . Roaring , " Has our Navy lost its guts ? " Potato Jones put out to sea to run the blockade unprotected , to find himself hailed as a hero by British sentimentalists ( TIME , April 26 ) . Changing his course at sea , Potato Jones last week was heading not for Bilbao but Alicante . Before he could reach it another British tramp , the Seven Seas Spray , had already run the gantlet and warped to a Bilbao pier , after having been halted , then wished unofficial Godspeed by a British destroyer . Reported her Captain , W. H. Roberts : <P> " I did n't see a single damn Rebel warship or a single mine . I 'll go anywhere merchant ships can go as long as I 've got a sturdy British bottom like the Seven Seas Spray , a good crew and my daughter Fifi . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but prefers to remain with me . She does n't know what fear is , and during our trip from Saint-Jean-de-Luz she was right there on the bridge , wearing trousers . " <P> Potato Jones and Captain Roberts having started the parade , within six days half-a-dozen freighters ran the blockade into Bilbao , if not with the official protection of Britain 's Navy , at least within range of its guns . <P> Doubting Thomases suggested that there was more to the British sympathy for Bilbao than pure altruism for a besieged city . Vitally needed for Welsh steel mills , now on 24-hour schedules as part of Britain 's rearmament , is iron ore from Basque mines . And Welsh farmers have long had a private arrangement with Basque potato growers . From carefully tended fields they ship high-priced seed potatoes to Bilbao twice a year , take back in exchange mature food potatoes , grown in Spain 's warm and dry climate .
