Even an extraordinary newshawk , obliged to send a story a day from the Antarctic , must resort to much journalistic bilge . The newshawk with Byrd 's Second Antarctic Expedition , Charles John Vincent Murphy , is not extraordinary . But last week aboard the Jacob Ruppert as she crept through the drift ice toward Little America , Reporter Murphy was unexpectedly handed the ideal Byrd expedition story of sudden danger , a narrow escape and a happy ending . <P> Hero of this Antarctic antic was Chief Airplane Pilot Harold June . With two others he took off in the expedition 's big Curtiss Condor , equipped with ski landing-gear , for a reconnaissance flight . In the take-off the wind whipped the skis back until they hung vertically from beneath the plane . Someone had forgotten to attach restraining wires from the toes of the skis to the wing struts . Pilot June was told by radio from the Jacob Ruppert what was wrong . Co-Pilot B. M. Bowlin crawled out on the wing , lost his cap and a glove in the icy blast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing could be done about it . <P> A score of the Ruppert 's crew scrambled out upon the ice with fire extinguishers , bandages and iodine ready for a bad crash . In less skillful hands than Pilot June 's the plane probably would have gouged her skis into the ice , somersaulted into a heap . Coolly he pulled his Condor 's nose up almost to the stalling angle , squashed the ship 's tail into the snow . The skis bounced up into a near horizontal . In that split second Pilot June set the ship down safely .
