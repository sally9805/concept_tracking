txt Two regions of high temperature in the stratosphere have been found by Dr. Fred L. Whipple , Harvard astronomer who told the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics today that 311 miles above the earth 's surface the air temperature is at the boiling point of water or about 100 degrees Centigrade , while at 70 miles the heat is 20 degrees Centigrade or I ordinary room temperature . Ordinarily the stratosphere is thought of as merely an extension of the cold expanse of thinning air extending above the six miles of % climate breeding troposphere next i to the earth . Balloon observations give no evidence that the temperature of the stratosphere is anything but icy cold and uniform at about 55 degrees below zero Centigrade . However , studies made during the last 25 years disclose certain phenomena such as sound reflection , tidal conditions in the upper air , and visually traced meteor paths which have led some researchers to believe that the conditions observed could be explained only if there existed hot 1 layers in the stratosphere . Dr. Whipple 's findings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in use at Harvard Observatory during the pact two years , introduces an entirely new approach , the most reliable yet found to the tangled problem . Direct evidence has been lacking and the theories have been subjected to much criticism . The meteor speedometer is a simple arrangement of a revolving fan blade in front of a telescope-camera lens . When a meteor flashes down across the field , its fiery path is broken at measured intervals . This gi.es , of course , an indication of speed and deceleration . One such speedometer is located in I Cambridge on Observatory Hill and the other is at Oak Ridge , Harvard , Mass . Both are trained on the same area of the sky and hence catching the meteor in two tele ; scopes enables determination of distance , height and directionof I motion . Using his apparatus Dr. Whipple has been able to obtain very accurate measurements in the area about 30 to 60 miles above ground I From figures on height , brightness , ! velocity and deceleration it is possible to derive very accurately the density @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the density can I be computed the temperature .
