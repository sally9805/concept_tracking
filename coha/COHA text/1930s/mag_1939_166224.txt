A patent for improved photographic technique was taken out in 1868 by a lady named Sarah A. L. Hardinge . In the 70 years which followed , she and her descendants took out 174 other patents . Mrs. Hardinge 's smart son , Hal , for instance , invented a machine which pulverizes ore by feeding it into a whirling drum containing a lot of little steel balls . Many a fortune has been made with it . It became generally known last week that Mrs. Hardinge 's smart grandson had added a smart refinement to his father 's famed " ball process " of ore reduction . <P> Hal Hardinge 's son , Harlowe , vice president and general manager of Hardinge Co. of York , Pa. , studied his father 's " ball mill " in operation . There was a certain rate of feeding in ore at which it performed most efficiently , the mill increased ; when too fast , the sound was muffled . Workmen were trained to listen for these changes in sound and manipulate the ore flow accordingly . But Harlowe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vary as much as 20 decibels . They judged the sound differently when they were tired and when they were fresh , before lunch and after lunch . <P> Harlowe Hardinge therefore invented a sensitive " electric ear " to replace human hearing . A parabolic reflector picks up the sound from the mill , focuses it on a microphone . If the sound is at the most efficient level , the microphone current keeps a galvanometer balanced between two contacts . If it rises or falls as little as one-quarter of a decibel , the galvanometer makes contact on one side or the other , closing a circuit which starts or stops the flow of ore as the situation requires . More than 75 of these electric ears are already in use . <P> At a meeting in Manhattan of the American Institute of Mining &; Metallurgical Engineers , big , bald Mr. Hardinge last week publicly described his invention for the first time . Other metallurgical miracles described at the meeting : <P> Sink- &-Float.; If a handful of bird shot mixed with sawdust is thrown into a pail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ float . Reason : the specific gravity of water is greater than wood 's , less than lead 's . The flotation method of separating ores from waste , using liquids of higher specific gravity than water , has been used for nearly a century . For over three decades E. I. du Pont de Nemours &; Co. has been trying to devise an economical flotation method for separating impurities such as shale and slate from low-grade anthracite coal . For " parting liquids , " they needed mixtures of controllable specific gravity up to three times that of water . Pentachlorethane and tetrabromethane filled this bill-after the Du Pont men worked out a way to use them over &; over again cheaply .
