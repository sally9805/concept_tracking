txt An army of specially-trained State inspectors climbed over and under thousands of New Jersey automobiles today as the Motor Vehicle Department started compulsory tests to drive unsafe cars from the highways . All " rattletraps " were doomed , but a relic of pre-war days that had been kept in shape stood a oetter chance than a sleek 1938 de luxe with " crick-eyed " headlights or lazy brakes . Thirty-day jeil terms and $200 fines for recalcitrants were written into the law which went into practical effect today with the opening of 28 inspection stations . The first batch of hundreds was notified to submit to inspection within seven days of a stipulated date  --  at a charge of 50 cents each for semiannual tests . Thousands have submitted to pre-view unofficial tests , which Motor Vehicle Commissioner Arthur W. Magee said were gratifying . Some have complained , largely on the ground the new law would " penalize " the poor motorist . Jason Licitra of Lyndhurst has organized opposition under the name of the New Jersey Anti-Automobile Examination League and claims several thousand signatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it would " chase the poor man from the highways . " The program , which Mr. Magee said would be more than as sustaining , went into effect as the department considered periodic examination of drivers as a further safety measure . Under the present system , in effect since 1913 , drivers are tested once and then forgotten , unless they have an accident . The department is considering check-ups every three or five years . The New Jersey motorist , starting today , drives his car onto two plates which check the wheel alignment and steering wheel play , as seven inspectors hop to a two-minute job . Up go the front ends of New Jersey 's million-odd cars under Jacks , and the springs , electric wiring and exhausts arc tested . Other inspectors look over the mirrors , glass , windshield wipers , horns , and lights . Photo-electric cells show headlight beam intensity and focus . Finally , an inspector drives the car on a brake-testing machine . Those who pass these and other mechanical tests get windshield stickers certifying their cars have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the road until they fix up their cars  --  or else .
