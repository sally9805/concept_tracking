IT TAKES more than a tine office and a beautifully tabulated bunch of figures to run a business at a profit . That is the had news which is slowly going the rounds . The late Judge Gary expressed the idea quite a while ago . The Steel Corporation was then in rented quarters in one of the older buildings on lower Broadway  --  a line , substantial , comfortable building , but not the last word in alike buildings . A real-estate agent interested the judge in a new building near by and had him very close to buying , when the judge hesitated , looked around at the substantial . well-worn furniture , and then said very slowly : " Yes , in that new building we could have handsome offices and new furniture and we should be very comfortable .

And so the corporation has never had to deflate itself . Today a wides'pread ego deflation is going on .

It is generally settled that one does not get far by pulling at one 's boot straps , but , human nature being what it is , it is only necessary to give things new names and the old boot straps take on a new significance . Now we are bring told that we were all wrong about the boot straps ; that our pit are not high and unselfish enough ; and that , if only we get socially conscious enough , one great big yank at them will save the world . The intellectuals who have no false modesty about then- int elleetealuess are now turning lip as Snei:11 scientists and social engineers . The indicters are hairline the stage .

Making the Disease Fit the Remedy Most of the indictments of business , in so fur ILs they stick to plain indicting , am true . It is perfectly absurd that the level of our economic ex-jetwoes should be so uncertain and that the livelihood of so many worthy people should be so precarious . Probably it is mit enough to answer that life itself is precarious and that centuries of medical and surgical study have given us nothing that can be culler ) a control over it .

Russia , gives a teebeical definition to unemployment , and those who do not come within the definition are not unemployed . They are just people perversely intent on starving to death . Economics is not an exact science . But neither is medicine . There are plenty of quack economists and plenty of quack doctors . The quack economists are very like the quack doctors in being very clear and specific in diagnosis  --  and the disease always fits the remedy that is in the hag ready to be pulled out . The economic diseases which we now have , so the best stories go , are all due to disorderly Finance and production  --  which is true enough . The remedy for disorder is order .

There is some divergence of opinion as to exactly what stabilizing business . means . Some say that it is enough to make profits eoutinuous , while others do not bother about profits and talk solely of stabilized employment . That is to be effected through unemployment . reeis ( ration , by insurance against unemployment and old age , and 112. ? a large provision for pe die worli. , 4 .

That is only it detail , as are also the met hods by which the East is going to be made to eat wheat when the West is long tut it , or the West will he made to eat rice when the East is long oil it . An impassioned regolutor does not bother about who will do the regulating or how . He has a beautiful and simple faith in the power of words writ ten into statutes . The very people who want the Eighteenth Amendment repealed because it interferes with their eoneeption of human liberty ehrerfully ask for the regulation by national boards of every detail of human life .

It has been on the soap boxes ever since these conveniences became rostrums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the noble and ancient , world-salvation program are being taken out of their crazy settings and launched by eonservative business men as new and highly respectable ideas . And most of these business men would be shocked to learn bow nearly they stand with the soap-boxers . Effects of Goorrnme , nt Control Take the campaign against the Sherman Antitrust Act . It can shown that the act promotes actual hardship through the preventing of proper combinations , while at the same time ii permits practices which are bad for everyone . Both the Socialists and the larger business men agree that some principle of cooperation must replace the rigid submission to courts of law of matters with which courts of law have not the training to deal , for the questions are not really of law at all . The Socialists would have governmental regulation . Business would like the power to regulate itself , The great example of governmental regulation is the Interstate Commerce Commission , founded on the principle of coutrolling the railroads in the interests of the public  --  passengers , shippers and investors alike . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which . is satisfactory to no one . But appaiently neither the private control of commodities nor the private control with government aid has been able to give any better results . The copper producers of the world , under the most expert auspices , joined in what amounted to an international cartel  --  although it had a different sort of name . They stabilized the price of copper . That is the dignified way of talking about a price increase . And filially the stabilized price went so high that hardly any sales were made . Then came the tunable , and copper has been lower than when the combination went into effect . These copper men are not social theorists and they have had at command all the brains and skill that the world afforded . Theirs was a private venture . Other conservative producers of world commodities have induced their governments to undertake price controls in order to insure profits  --  they were willing to adopt soeialislic principles , up to a point . And what has been the result ? Sugar , under Cuban auspices , dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British control , dropped from seventy-five cents to eight cents ; coffee , with Brazil managing , slid from sixteen cents to three cents ; Japan chaperoned silk from seven dollars down to three dollars ; while Italy killed sulphur and Chile killed nitrates . And it has not been demonstrated that the Farm Board hat . saved American wheat or that the Cauadiau Wheat Pool has been an unmixed blessing to the Dominion wheat farmers . The Only Way to Get Anything There must be a catch somewhere in the joint theory of the business men and the social reformers that we need more control in business , for the industries and the commodities in which the greatest control has obtained  --  either private or public  --  have suffered more than those which made no pretense of having any control . Take wages and hours . Some employers insist that wages must be cut , while the socially minded outsiders cry for shorter work days without reducing wages . Both have the dame delusion  --  that some force outside of the work can be brought in . The employers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only at the expense of profits . And yet if we learned anything during the years following 19 ' 21 ? coming hard after the experiences with the false wages in 1919 ? it was that . keeping up the wages and forcing down the prices was the surest way to profits  --  provided the high wages were translated into low wages per unit of production . While that condition held , we had years of more substantial prosperity than we ever before knew . But the hidebound Socialist 's theory is quite the sarno as the hidebound capitalist 's theory  --  the only way to get anything is to take it from someone else . The tariff and the war debts also fit into the structure of the perfectly or-dered world state . It is only the pres-ent American tariff that matters , and the only war debts which are burden-some are those owed to the United States . In the perfect world state there can be neither tariffs nor war debts , and , as a step toward perfection , the United States is urged to abolish the lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the present tariff rates prevent the overseas na-tions from selling to us , and hence from buying from us , and hence from paying the interest on the money that has privately been loaned to them . The feeeueeed ea Page 1001 ( Continued from Page 96 ) argument flows evenly , but so also does the rebuttal , which says that the United States is the largest consumer of raw materials , that many of these pay no duty , that an appreciable quantity of manufactured goods would in no ease be imported , and that it is far better to keep out these marginal goods and promote employment here , than to let them in and disturb our own prices . Exactly the same tariff arguments are being used today that have hcen used with slight changes ever since the McKinley Tariff Ant . But that high-tariff act is credited by many with having had a great deal to do with jacking up the American standard of Living . So it would appear that ! he few recent . adjustments could hardly have knocked the pins from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death was actively urging a tariff wall in the British Empire  --  but as a measure of world economic stabilization ! And Sir . Josiah Stamp has said : " America 's and England 's problems are in many instances similar . Obviously , what is common in our troubles can not be due to high tariffs or free trade ; they can not be due to one country being too much rationalized and the other too little : they can not be due to higher wages or lower wages . There are a considerable number of causes of the present depression in particular countries . Some eighteen , I IhMk. are valid , but many of them would be unimportant and local if it were not for deep underlying troubles . " As for the war debts , let me quote a banker who does not pretend to be international . He observed : " There may he some great advantages in increasing our own taxes in order to decrease some of the foreign ones  --  for that is what canceling the debts means . But the exact advantages have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been told often enough that if only I had a real understanding of world affairs I should see them . Uutil f can see that it is better business to " barge off the balance of the debts than to take the little money that is coming . I shall he in favor of taking the money . " Spreading the ButterThin For instance , it is taken for granted that , by the very nature of things , agriculture must be seasonal and , also , that every so often there will ho short-crop years as well as long-crop years . It used to be taken for granted that some sections of industry were definitely seasonal  --  that there must be short swings during the year in addition to the long swings from prosperity to depression . The seasonal nature of some sales is inherent . Consumers ' minds do not turn to ice skates in summer or to straw hats in winter . Women will wear furs in summer and straw hats in winter , but , generally speaking , humanity will not disregard the weather . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in winter  --  although much has been done in the way of winter building . In general , however , the winter affords less work than does the summer , and that is why our unemployment panics always start with the coming of cold weather . Industry has been grappling mightily with the short . seasonal problem quite aside from the unemployment phase , for it takes less capital investment to make a given quantity of goods in twelve months than to make the same quantity in three months , and pay interest on the idle plant during the remaining nine months . On the other hand , by no means all commodities will store , and whether it is cheaper to produce on an even schedule and have someone hold the bag , or to produce unevenly according to the selling season , is an affair governed by specific eases . The Influence of the Seasons No governmental planning board can possibly know as much about these seasons or be more anxious to apply correctives thou the industrialists who have their money at stake . The automobile industry is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ears were laid up during the winter , but now , with the closed bodies , they are used throughout the year  --  although the summer mileage is still much greater than the winter . In spite of extending the seasonal use of cars , the industry remains highly seasonal and there is a very distinct financial as well as physical limit to the number of ears That can he produced and stored for future use . On paper it is a very easy matter to plan the stabilization programs which recognize the seasons and shift the whole business of any concern from the kind of product that can be sold during one season to an entirely different product that can he sold in another season , but in practice these paper plans seldom work out . For even if the mechanical equipment can be shifted  --  and often it can not  --  the human equipment is not so mobile , for neither the workmen nor the salesmen will shift according to schedule . That is where the rub comes . Another very great obstacle which the serious spree thinkers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized already , and that turning a big new unit into a- field already occupied , while it may , on paper , look like a way of stabilizing the unit , really only , serves to upset the industry which it enters . Only rarely , experience has shown , is the unit effective in the new field and not only does it upset the existing arrangements but it also loses money and eventually retires in disorder . The Racial-science model for what is called the general coerdinating of industry is the War Industries Board that came into existence during the war and found work for everyone . That board had behind it the whole credit-making and money-printing machinery of the United States . Those who point . so dramatically to it as an example or what could be done forget that it did not have to make ends meet . The dramatic pointers , of course . do not suggest any supplementary device by which the country can gel along permanently without having to make ends meet . The seasonal nature of industry is always disturbing , although few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The big thing now , however , is what is grandly called long-range planning , by which affairs would be so comprehensively arranged that nothing would be done out of turn , everything would be done precisely at the right time and in the right way , and thus everyone in the country would either he employed or comfortably living off an insurance fund , accumulated by lopping a slice off wages and profits during good times . It is being said with a great appearance of authority that we shall be utterly negligent and lacking in social consciousness unless we create a board  --  presumably to he located at Washington  --  which will plan everything at least ten years ahead . More particularly , this board will evolve great public-works projects which will be pushed forward when general work gets slack and held Lack when general work tightens . These public works are to be paid for out of taxes . It is taken for granted that the board will be able to do what no one else in the world has ever yet been able to do  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well is bottomless . The DiuIdend.Wage Ratio The unemploymen t-insurance schemes that are being put forward in countless numbers and with a superior sort of confidence , all claim actually to he insurance plans and therefore mathematically perfect . It is pointed out that prosperous corporations do not pay out all their profits in dividends , but carry part of them over to a surplus account and out of this account . pay dividends in those years when sufficient profile are not earned . It is reasoned that if corporations can insure their profits they can just as easily insure their wages . It all sounds very plausible  --  until one begins to look into the facts . In a typical year the United States Steel Corporation paid $96,000 , - 000 in interest and dividends and $4-20,000,000 in wages . In the same year the General Electric Company paid 842,01.10,000 in interest and dividends and $163,000,000 in wages : , the Bethlehem Steel Company paid $33 , - 000,000 in interest and dividends and $124,000,000 in wages ; and the railroads paid 5868,000,000 in interest and dividends and $2,600,000,000 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out only a portion of the profits in dividends and to plow the rest back into plant and equipment . the surplus account of a corporation , there is seldom enough cash or easily convertible securities to pay more than a year 's unearned dividends . The practice of returning so much of the earnings to plant and equipment has been severely criticized . It obtains , however , only among the very prosperous corporations . The great majority of our corporations can pay dividends only when they earn profits , and it would be an exceedingly pleasant surprise to many holders of common stocks to learn that they could , by law , get dividends regardless of the state of business . They would welcome the news that a method had been discovered for insuring dividends for all time . It remains a fact that if dividends are paid in a year when they are not earned they are paid for money which in a sense belonged to the holders of the stock in the year when the money was earned . Therefore , if corporations are to accumulate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years when there is little business , then the money must be taken from the wages in the years when there is business . Once more we are simply spreading the butter thinner . It might . be that workmen generally would consent to giving up a part of their wages while working in order to get the money hack while not working . Insurance Versus Savings Quite a number of corporations have established mutual-benefit funds and . made other arrangements to provide allowances for certain classes of employes during lay-offs . These plans are savings plans . They are not insurance schemes , for the risks of unemployment are not sufficiently well known to make possible anything approaching insurance . And they all lake for granted that the company 's business will increase and prosper . They do not provide for the company 's starting into a decline and becoming n hark number . The state and nal ional insurance plans for unemployment sound like 11-surance plan t when Li/Atzed they are not insurance plain ; al all . A life-insurance company can make a rate because , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of death at various ages and , on the other hand , it has money-interest tables . It has very accurate averages to deal with and also it has a very definite fact to deal with . When a man is dead he is dead , but an unemployed man may be man for whom there is no work , a man who will not or who is unfit to work , or a man accustomed only to a job which has gone out of existence . Being unemployed is not a definite status like death . The supposedly scientific method of public unemployment insurance is for the employer and the employed each , by law , to contribute to a slate fund which is used to pay allowances during periods of unemployment . In Germany-this runs as high us 16 per vent of wages . But never anywhere has a state insurance scheme been able to get along without tremendously heavy contributions from the taxpayers . For nowhere , except in Russia , has the necessary comp/ement to unemployment insurance been brought forward  --  that is , forced labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the state is to pay men when there is no work , it must have the power to force them to work when there is work . In England there are more miners than there would be jobs if all the mines were running full  --  and the mines can not run full , for other things have taken the place of coal , In London there are 150,000 dock laborers with no possibility at all that the docks can use more than 35,000 . Thousands of British boys have come into ' manhood , received the dole and have never worked . Unemployment insurance everywhere eventually gots around to one part of the population living miserably and unproductively on taxes taken from // that part of the population which at the time does not happen to be living so miserably . Every stock raiser knows that a given area of grazing land will support just so many cattle , and that . if he puts in a larger number , some of them are going to starve  --  unless he provides feed from the outside or raises the fertility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by executive list the cattle can not only be prevented from starving but will actually be very happy indeed . Presumably they will feed on the fiat . Want Created by Plenty It would appear that , if only we reason things through sufficiently far , we arrive where we started  --  we come out the same door we went in . That is perfectly true if we assume that there is only so much to go around and the Foie question is one of division . It is a most extraordinary fact that every Mau labeled as progressive starts with the assumption that nothing ever will prowess  --  that there never will he any more to go around  --  and that there is an irreconcilable conflict between profits and wages , that somehow wages are holier than profits and that wages can exist without profits . There are two very definite ways of attacking the problem of poverty . There is the supine  --  falsely styled progressive  --  way of abolishing poverty by changing its definition  --  that is , by so dividing the present goods of the world that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active way in which poverty is a comparative condition with even the lowest ranges very far above the line of destitution . All the present . plans , no matter how eloquently they are phrased , no matter how noble are their stated purposes , have as their eventual end thedivision and redivision to that vanishingpoint where everyone will live on the border line of destitution . For all these plans provide only for division . None of them provide for production . None of them comprehend the one elemental , inescapable fact that unless something be produced there can be nothing to divide . They are all attempts to devise anew technic by which pulling at one 's boot straps can be made effective in a big way . The alternative to the brass-band program of relief has in itnoelemen ts of the dramatise It is not good material for a speech . It does not in the least appeal to the imattination , for it does not promise something for nothing . His usually taken for granted that all our troubles are due to recurring periods of overproduction -- that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mount up and cause so much trouble as to bring about the extraordinary paradox of want being created by plenty . The real puzzle , once one begins to study the figures that are available , is apparently not overproduction , for the normal production of yesterday becomes the overproduction of today when the buying situation changes . Either we always have overproduction or we never have it . According to the Day Ss Thomas index , the rate of growth of manufacturing in the United States during the years from 1926 to I920 , inclusive , was less than the rate of prewar increase . The total world basic production gives the same result , and the League of Nations figures , which have been kept since 1923 , confirm the world figures . In so far as can be discovered , there has never been a time in which all industries were prosperous , but we do not seem to pay much attention to them except when everything goes sour . For instance , during the past period of prosperity in the United States , agriculture and the railways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal was in a bad way all the time . Why do we , every so often , have to bother about everything at . once ? These matters are being given a great deal of attention by the deeper students of business and finance , and the belief is growing that these alternating periods of prosperity and depression are not due to overproduction or to speculation or anything of the sort  --  that these are merely surface effects and not causes , and that overproduetiou as a fact . has never existed . In normal times the largest stocks of commodities are those in the bands of the consumers . If the consumers are frightened they will buy very closely  --  instead of keeping five pounds of sugar on hand , they will keep one pound ; they will do without the extra pair of shoes ; and they will use their spare tires instead of buying new ones . These changes in buying habits at once stop the flow of trade , and normal supplies remain unsold until the consumers exhaust their reserves and come into the market to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is with money  --  that is , with credit . The supply and demand of credit apparently have a larger influence upon prices than the supply and demand of commodities , although there is no absolute information to be had on any of these points . Evils of Excess Credit The plain fact is that we know practically nothing about money or prices . The most profound study on this point has been made by Mr. Carl Snyder at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York . Be has shown very conclusively that when tho supply of credit increases at a rate faster than the growth of business , the surplus credit goes to speculating in things made instead of into making things . This continues until the demand for speculative credit becomes so great that legitimate business can not afford to pay the price for money , and finally speculation itself can not afford to pay the price , Then a collapse comes through credit exhaustion . In the United States the credit line started to go up faster than the business line in 1927-28 . That was the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the crash . During the early part of 1929 credit got out of all relation with business . If credit is behind prices , and prices are behind trade , and trade is behind employment and prosperity , then there is at hand for the first time in history a very certain method of destroying poverty . For if there exists a definite relation between credit supply and real prosperity , and this relation can be preserved by accurate statistical control , then credit can be more or less automatically supplied forproperbusiness and proper speculation without ever affording enoughforimproper husinessorimproper speculation . And thusproduction can go forward without the fear of false overproduction and consequent unemployment . This method makes for tho increasing of wealth and providing more to go around , in striking contrast to the advertised methods , all of which have as their ends not the increasing of wealth but the spreading of it more thinly .
