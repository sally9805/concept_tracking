On view last week was another of those scandals which periodically afford U. S. film followers an intimate glimpse of high &; low life in Hollywood . While the cinema colony shamefully hung its tail between its legs , while circulation managers of the tabloid Press howled with delight , Mary Astor and Dr. Franklyn Thorpe battled for the custody of their 4-year-old daughter in a mud-slinging contest in which the purpose of each was to make the other appear grossly immoral . <P> Lucille Langhanke was born in Quincy , Ill. 30 years ago .

Then the case passed from the nursery to the boudoir as each of the disputants began telling not the judge but the Press how oversexed the other was . <P> A tattling nurse produced by Miss Astor named four women who at various times after the divorce had apparently spent the night with Dr. Thorpe . One of these , a blonde onetime showgirl named Norma Taylor* , was also recalled by a Los Angeles policeman . Dr. Thorpe had summoned him in after Miss Taylor , intoxicated , had invaded his dining room when he was eating with his daughter , brandished a candlestick , chased him upstairs , cornered him in a bathroom , plunged a fork into his thigh .
