WORDS THAT WON THE WAR-James R. Mock &; Cedric Larson-Princeton ( $3.75 ) . <P> Two years ago the National Archives in Washington , D. C. dispatched big trucks to the Munitions Building at 20th Street and Constitution Avenue to clear its basement of an all-but-forgotten stock of yellowing records . They were the files of the Committee on Public Information , better known as the Creel Committee of the World War , one of the most successful propaganda ministries of all time . Mysteriously , three-fourths of the files had disappeared. * <P> But the remaining fourth-the majority of which Authors Mock &; Larson were the first to comb-told a true story , fascinating both as history and as a civics lesson , doubly absorbing in relation to the present times . <P> The work of the Creel Committee was well absorbed by most U. S. citizens-the younger generation , it has been said , never quite recovered . Not easily forgotten were the Creel Committee 's Halt the Hun posters , with their spidery villains ; its movies , with riotous queues fighting to see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; its 75,000 spellbinding Four-Minute Men ; its Red , White and Blue pamphlets , in which famed history professors rewrote German history ; its National School Service ( circulation : 20,000,000 homes ) ; its syndicated news ( 20,000 columns a week ) , boiler-plate ads , feature stories by such writers as Mary Roberts Rinehart , Booth Tarkington , Rex Beach . Few have forgotten the CPI 's war expositions , its traveling French officers , such stunts as Theda Bara in her Liberty Bond booth before the New York Public Library ( receipts : $300,000 in one day ) . But the most voluminous memory will be surprised at the scope of the CPI in Words that Won the War . <P> Authors Mock &; Larson also correct many a misconception about the CPI . One of these is that the Creel Committee was entirely responsible for converting a neutral-minded public into a rabid war mob overnight . A lot of neutrality had crumbled away before George Creel finished it off . From Theodore Roosevelt in Oyster Bay to Ambassador Page in London , most of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the start . On March 11 , " War Sunday " had sounded the call to arms in the nation 's churches . Four weeks before war the Railroad Brotherhoods said their threatened strike would be called off in event of war . Nicholas Murray Butler 's Carnegie Endowment for International Peace had for several months been whooping up war spirit . Creel 's hand was seen , however , in the speedy passage of the Espionage Act of June 15 , the Sedition Act of May 16 , 1918.
