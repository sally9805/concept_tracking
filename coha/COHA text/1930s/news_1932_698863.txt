txt The answer of the bonus expeditionary force today to the warnings of disease and to the efforts of the District of Columbia to choke off the stream of incoming veterans was to adopt such measures as it could to forestall an epidemic , and to send recruiting squads throughout the country to rally 50,000 reinforcements to the army now here demanding immediate payment of the $2,400,000,000 bonus certificates . In the meantime , an emergency conference of leading Washington physicians , dentists and health officers with General Pelham D. Glassford , superintendent of police , was held at the University Club to seek means of dealing with the health situation . It developed at this conference that the daily sick call among the men encamped in shacks built of material dragged from the city dump , or sleeping on straw on the open ground at Anacostia , had jumped from 30 to 350 and that more than 200 men were applying each day for medical aid at the Veterans ' Bureau and were being rejected . The possibility that a typhoid epidemic might be in the offing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been working at the camp for the past week had fallen Ill of typhoid fever . Dr. Hugh S. Cumming , surgeon general of the Public Health Service , added his plea today to the one telegraphed by the District of Columbia commissioners to the Governors of all the States yesterday , asking them to discourage more veterans from coming here and adding to a situation which thus far has baffled the Washington authorities . Cumming Sends Out Warning . Dr. Cumming inspected the camp and said he found conditions highly dangerous from the standpoint of public health . He telegraphed to all State public health officers as follows : " Assembling of the so-called bonus army in Washington presents a serious problem of the interstate spread of disease . Suggest as measure of lessening danger you issue warningl to your State advising of menace to i public health of gathering of these men in Washington , and of consequent danger to people of State upon return . journey . For protection of public health everything should be IdoLe to discourage departure from your State of groups of marchers for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dangerous . " those attending the emergency dhealth meeting included the presients of the district medical and dental societies , Colonel J. J. Staley , commanding the Sixth Brigade of Marines , and Major D. S. Knowlton , brigade surgeon . It dealt with the fact that a num- ber of the unemployed veterans , now pouring in at a rate which brought II the total near 12,000 today , were suffering from Infectious maladies and that the Sixth Brigade Infirmary , which has been treating them , is now taxed beyond its capacity . Three of the men answering sick call today were in need of immediate surgical attention . Thus far efforts to isolate those who are ill have not succeeded . It was decided to open a larger dispensary and a fifty-bed hospital immediately unless the city hospitals made beds available at once . The physicians present pledged their cooperation and both physicians and dentists will donate their services , but medical and dental supplies are urgently needed . Glassford Asks $3,000 Donations . After the meeting General Glassford appealed for public donations of 1$3,000 for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended this meeting , " he said , t " that prompt action is necessary to ; avoid a situation which may bring discredit upon the District of Columbia , particularly an epidemic of diseases , with the many fatalities which would be sure to occur . " 1 A further warning came today from Dr. William C. Fowler , District I health officer . He indicated that he was considering the quarantining of the ex-service men 's camp if conditions warranted it , and said that if necessary he would not hesitate to call upon a regiment of marines to enforce the quarantine . W. W. Waters , the commander-inchief of the bonus army , evinced eagerness to cooperate fully with the authorities to ward off the danger of an epidemic . He hinted , however , that the emphasis placed upon health conditions might be partly designed to break up the bonus encampment and discourage recruiting . " The national headquarters of the bonus expeditionary force feels that there has been some exaggeration of the situation , " he said . In a conference this morning Mr. Waters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately , incoming contingents of veterans will be placed in isolation for twenty-four hours and examined for diseases . They will also be examined as to their eligibility as genuine war veterans and their willingness to live under the stringent discipline being maintained by the organization . Negotiations are under way to obtain permission from the District of Columbia to use Fort Foote , six miles south of Anacostia , as an isolation camp for men suffering from illness . As quicklyas it is feasible Ana. - " ' costia will be converted into a receiving camp solely , and arriving veterans will be transferred to other living places . 300 Moved to Another Camp . Three hundred veterans were transferred to Camp Simms today , and installations were made for another 300 , with rolling kitchens , tents and the like for their comfort . The Police Superintendent also made a survey of vacant buildings in the city to serve as billets , and ordered two large buildings on Pennsylvania Avenue which have been condemned made ready for this purpose . Attempts also are being made to obtain the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billeting place for veterans of radical tendencies . The Police Superintendent and the bonus army commander agreed that a veteran is a veteran , whatever his present political beliefs , and radicals with honorable discharges will be accepted and furnished with food and lodging . So hostile , however , have the rank and file of the veterans been to so-called Communists among them that segregation has been necessary for the safety of the latter . A minor crisis of this sort rose late last night when a detachment of 150 veterans , most of them foreign-born , arrived from Cleveland dirty and disheveled after days in coal gondolas . They were found to have the membership cards of the Workers ' ExService Men 's League , an organization of veterans which the Communists have sponsored . " Regular " veterans crowded about and threatened actual violence . To prevent trouble the camp leaders marched them off for the night , but this morning the newcomers were conducted in again . They explained that they had been approached by agents of the league and told they would not get the bonus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid from 10 cents to $1 for . memberships . They all raised their right hands in an oath of fidelity to the United States and were permitted to settle down peaceably with the others . " It is absolutely imperative to get the bonus expeditionary force under some kind of shelter , " said General Glassford after his conference with Mr. Waters . " It has not been possible to get government tentage , first , because it is perishable ; second , because it is very expensive ; and . third , because there is only a small amount available and no funds to replace it . Approximately ' 3,000 visiting veterans slept last night without shelter . " The veterans themselves bought eighteen tents today , enough to shelter 250 men , and a New York merchant has volunteered army " pup tents " and blankets . The executive committee appointed Captain Doak E. Carter of Cleveland , who was in the war with the Fortieth Divigion , as national sanitary officer to cooperate with health officers and to enforce sanitary discipline among the men . He began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The headquarters also adopted measures to discourage the random wandering about the camp of sightseers , who include many children . Guides were appointed to conduct all visitors . " It is obvious , " said the commander in explaining this . " that if an infectious or contagious disease should occur in the camp it might be carried out by visitors who wander indiscriminately through the camp , just as it is possible that disease might be introduced by visitdrs carrying infections . " Recruiting Parties Leave . A dozen " recruiting Officers , " equipped with credentials of the national headquarters , left toddy to drum up new increments of men in every , part of the country . Bonus army leaders declare that if they are defeated in the House next week they will only increase their efforts and throw in new reserves as au army commander does when he is checked . Accordingly , the delegations started out in battered trucks and automobiles for St. Louis , New Jersey and for the South . At the same time , it was learned , recruiting parties were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march originated , Seattle and California . These groups are to move eastward along the northern , central and southern routes , enlisting more veterans in the march to Washington and providing also for the shipment of food supplies to the capital . Replies expressing sympathy with the national capital 's problem were received today from several Governors in response to the appeal yesterday to keep the veterans at home . Governor Roosevelt of New York was among them and he telegraphed that he was sending Nils Anderson of the New York temporary emergency relief administration to make arrangements for the return of New York veterans who wished to go home . A few veterans have returned home , but they are insignificant In number in comparison to the hundreds who are steadily pouring in . Representative Bacharach of New Jersey today paid the railway fare back home of thirty-eight New Jersey marchers , and said that another man bought tickets for sixty-five others . " Radio Priest " Gives $5,000 . Assurance of food for the next forty-eight hours was given in a donation of $5,000 today by the Rev. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He specified that the money be used to provide food and shelter and that none of it was to be spent on Communists . Food came in on trucks from home towns and $2,000 remained in - the fund placed in General Glassford 's hands . The army is frankly living from hand to mouth but telegrams offering both men and food are coming in from many localities . A series of benefit dances to raise funds is being arranged by Miss Anna Scott , war-time yeomanette . Washington people are contributing many incidentals , such as reading matter and games for the men . One woman who contributed food said that her brother had been killed in the war . " The morale is good , " said Mr. Waters tonight . " The boys are sticking by their declared . intention to stay in Washington until they get the bonus , and if it comes to a showdown and the bill fails to pass the House or Senate the boys intend to keep carrying on and send for men and yet morq men , "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
