WE hear that Mrs. Max Oser has changed her children 's names to Oser-McCormick . This is said to be in keeping with an old Swiss custom , but we bet she got the idea right from her own family : RKO-Roxy . SAY what you want about Radio City , it is the metropolis of good manners . A Buffalo girl went to a show there the other evening , and had hardly gained the Great Hall when she realized she had made a mistake . She had entered the Music Hall when she had meant to enter the RKO-Roxy . Being a girl of some executive training , she went with her dilemma directly to the management , who rose to the occasion by assigning a liveried Adonis to escort her down Sixth Avenue to the cathedral of her dreams . She says that trotting down Sixth Avenue behind a Music Hall usher ( you trot behind , not beside ) is like nothing else in life : the giant stride , the eyes front , the cape floating , the swirl and beauty of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like to see other foreigners within our gates receive , when , for example , they get by accident into the B.-ALT. instead of the Inter-borough .

BUGG SMOKING TOBACCO For Men and Pipes , Not for Dudes and Cigarettes WE were out to City Island last week , mooning around the yards and wishing we had a boat to start fussing with . We have a particular reason for wanting a boat this year : we want to cruise as far as the Bay of Fundy to hear the new fog signal on Partridge Island .

PAINT is the ordinary wine of Spring ; and the greatest paint job we ever saw in all our life is now in Central Park . It is the carrousel .

Calling upon some friends in the Gramercy Park district , she inquired of the doorman the way to the lift . This puzzled him . He shook his head and murmured that there must be some mistake . Whereupon the lady bethought herself that this was America and explained that she wanted the elevator . The doorman escorted her to it at once . Now the funny thing was that he took her to a large mahogany door plainly labeled in gold lettering " Lift . " This happened in a building called the Gramercy Arms on Twenty-second Street .

We have seen them at work . This mamma of all jigsaw puzzles was mentioned here last September , when it was just an idea , and we made a note about it then . It 's to adorn the Sixth Avenue entrance ( or loggia ) of the R.C.A. Building in Rockefeller Center and it will glitter over three walls , a total length of seventy-nine feet . It will he fourteen feet high . More than a million tiny pieces of colored glass will unite to depict Mankind getting the better of Ignorance , Poverty , Cruelty , and Fear through the happy instruments of Religion , Drama , Chemistry , Sports , Biology , el al . The thing has many more messages than " Uncle Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start putting the mosaic on the walls , and it will take a whole month . Meantime it is being expertly assembled in separate sections over the river . Barry Faulkner , American , is the artist . His design , as expressed in a small sketch , was selected in competition last summer , and he retired with the small sketch to the country to do an oil painting of it . Last December he brought this to town and it was turned over to Ravenna Mosaics , Inc . They set nineteen men copying the oil in bits of glass . The painting is smaller than the mosaic , on a scale of four inches to the foot , and the first step was to make full-sized pencil sketches of the painting in separate pieces , each about a foot square . There are about eleven hundred of these . In the Ravenna studio , the nineteen experts sit at benches , each with one of the sketches before him on a table . The workers are completely surrounded by tin cans containing tessera  --  the bits of colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barry 's picture , which they glance at from time to time for the proper colors . Each man has a chisel and a kind of anvil , for use when he has to chip the little pieces down to fit . This is hard , because the pieces are so small to begin with . The tesserm are put face down upon the pencil sketches and adhere to a layer of flour paste that has been spread on the paper . As the sketches are covered , they are laid out on the floor and fitted together in sections , like a great jigsaw puzzle . When installation starts , the sections will be carefully carted to Radio City to be assembled on the floor of the R.C.A. Building . Then the walls will be covered with wet cement and the sections , covered with cement on their backs , and each numbered as in a portable Scars , Roebuck house ( so that Religion wo n't get mixed up with Fear ) , will be fitted into their proper places . Thus gradually Intelligence will awaken Mankind , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall , twelve feet on the south wall , and fifty-five feet on the east wall . Westward is Sixth Avenue and the " L. " Here 's the story you will see on the walls : In the centre will be a gigantic lady labeled in fine , legible letters Thought , with one hand on the shoulder of a young woman labeled Spoken Words and the other hand on the shoulder of a young man labeled Written Words . The three will stand on a cloud with their heads in another cloud . Smaller figures ( all the figures in the panorama will wear robes ) will zoom to one side and the other of the central trio , labeled Biology , Sports , Politics , Religion , Drama , Medicine , Publicity , and Chemistry . There will also be an unlabeled angel with a microphone ( Miss Radio ) . At the extreme right of all these conquering forces a male figure in solid-green mosaic , marked Poverty , and a solid-green woman marked Fear , will be seen toppling head-down through the crimson flames of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female ) and Ignorance ( male ) will meet the same fate . The mosaic glass used in the design comes from Berlin . There are ten thousand shades of color available in this glass , but only two hundred and fifty will be used in " Awakening , " as we call it for short . Drop in and count them along about April 1 , which is the tentative date for the unveiling . And it 's not a day too soon . Conspiracy AFRED ADLER , the psychologist , a short time ago visited Providence , Rhode Island , where he was asked to dine at the home of some friends . He had put in such a busy day that he had n't had time to stop for lunch and consequently ' was pretty hungry . Dinner was still an hour or so off . . Presently he spied a dish of cookies on a table and , rising casually , sauntered over to it , but his hostess had her eye on him . " No , no , " she said , gaily . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went back and sat down . Presently he felt a tug at his trouser leg and a hot little hand placed something in his . The daughter of the house , aged nine , had understood his predicament . He got away with the cookie somehow or other , without being detected , and his confederate slipped him some more . Later on he took her aside and , in a whisper , asked her what he could give her in return for her kindness . " Stamps , " she said . A few days afterward she got through the mail a package containing eight hundred stamps . A hundred for each cookie . Master of Angelmo MILE colored singer , Roland Hayes , - 1-  now owns the plantation in Georgia on which his parents lived as slaves . His poppy and mammy belonged to a Joseph Mann , a kindly gentleman who died three years ago at the age of 100 . Mann had a sixhundred-acre estate near Curryville , and after the big emancipation most of his slaves asked to stay on as tenant farmers . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old farm up many years before Hayes bought it in 1926 , but about forty families , most of them descendants of Mann 's farmer slaves , were still on the place . They remain there as tenants , raising cotton and some wheat . They have built roads and dams and a power plant . Hayes finances them in the spring and summer , and they pay him hack when the crops mature . He does n't make any profit from their labors . He calls the place Angelmo Farm , in memory of his mother , Angelmo being a word he made up from Angel and mother . Hayes , who is forty-five now , has been singing since his teens . He was next to youngest of seven children and was only twelve when his father died . Three of the Hayes boys had gone off to seek their fortunes ; the Hayes daughter had married ; Mamma Hayes picked up the three other boys , including Roland , and left the back country for Chattanooga . There Roland got a job in a sashweight foundry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . When he was sixteen , he began to sing in Chattanooga colored churches , and one day a Negro pianist and voice teacher named Arthur Calhoun heard him . Calhoun gave him free lessons , and after two years started him off for Oberlin College in Ohio , much against Mrs. Hayes ' will , for she believed that singin ' was just so much mcssin ' around . She reluctantly gave him fifty dollars , however , for his trip . The young singer did n't get to Oberlin , though . He stopped over in Nashville , thinking to make a little money singing in churches there . He gave four concerts . At the first one , four people showed up . The others were n't much better . At the end of four Sundays , he had just five dollars and gave up the Oberlin idea . He went up to Fisk University , which is in Nashville , and sang , at his own request , for the head of the music department ( a white woman ) and for the president ( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fisk , with the understanding that he would sing in the University chapel and with the Fisk Jubilee Singers any time he was asked to . He got his food and lodging by waiting tables in the University and by tending furnaces in the city . At the end of four years , the University dropped him . " I was a nonconformist " is his explanation . Last April , however , the University sent for him and solemnly conferred on him the degree of Doctor of Music . He solemnly accepted it . After leaving Fisk , Hayes worked in a club in Louisville , whose members later helped him to go to Boston and study under Arthur Hubbard . He worked as a page for a life-insurance company in Boston , singing at his work . It was n't until 1917 , when he was thirty , that he really began to be heard . He gave a concert in a Boston hall and came nut with tiwo thousand dollars . Then he toured the country , but barely made expenses . It was in Europe , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerts and was widely acclaimed . The following year , he was commanded to sing before the King and Queen at Buckingham He sang for an hour and a half , ending with Negro spirituals ? he always sings them last , for he is more interested in French , English , Italian , and German songs . Melba heard him in London , called on him , spoke his praises . In 1923 , he came back here to find himself famous . The next year , he was again in London and sang once more for the Kin and Queen , at the home of Lady Harcourt . This time he closed with a group of old English songs and touched Their Majesties . Afterward they talked with him alone for an hour , mostly about African music , which he was studying . He is still interested in it and plans to make an elaborate tour through the Dark Continent in a year or so . He has a fine collection of African musical instruments in his Boston home , and an extensive library of books on Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back from his first London triumphs , died very proud of her singin ' boy and happy that she had finally given him the fifty dollars . The King THE young Chicago heavyweight , King Levinsky , who was defeated at Madison Square Garden last Friday night , is not considered a genius , even by his closest friends and most ardent admirers , so we are told by a man who is pretty close to pugilism and pugilists . Levinsky was in Cleveland last summer at the time of the solar eclipse and , although the papers were full of it and it was a topic of wide conversation , he knew nothing about it . If he had heard it mentioned , it had n't registered . Most of Cleveland turned out into the streets for the spectacle and Levinsky went along , too . An acquaintance handed him a piece of smoked glass and , with it to his eye , he peered up at the phenomenon . After a moment , he handed hack the glass and , shaking his head , remarked in a tone of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't it ? " During one of his fights , Levinsky 's seconds were worried because he came hack to his corner at the end of every round in obvious and deep distress , although his opponent did n't seem to be punishing him much . At the end of five or six rounds , the fighter confided that his feet hurt him . Immediate investigation disclosed that they hurt for the reason that he had the right shoe on the left foot and vice versa . The fighter was greatly surprised when so simple a reason was found for his pain and , the shoes being changed , evinced his relief by knocking his opponent out a couple of rounds later . High Up A COMMUTER whose chief dis-tinction was that he owned a Chevrolet that was n't running very well picked up the phone in his office the other morning , in a moment of swashbuckle , and said to his operator : " Get me a Chrysler place . " The operator nearly caught , but did not quite catch , the remark . As a consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire : " This is Mr. Chrysler 's secretary speaking . " The commuter squirmed but decided to go through with the situation . " Why , " he said , thinking fast , " I would like to know if you people have a dealer in Greenwich . I 'm thinking vaguely of buying a new car . " Mr. Chrysler 's secretary gave the name of the Greenwich dealer . Then he added : " What train are you going out on tonight ? " The man told him . That night , when he reached his house , there was a Chrysler in front of the door , and a salesman ready to demonstrate it . The fellow finally got his Chevrolet fixed up ; there really was n't much the matter with it anyway . Pin-Pawning MR . H. W. HAWLEY is employed in the research department of the Cunard Line , and there he would be unmolested by our moving finger if he did n't have an odd little hobby which makes him of special interest . He retrieves lost fraternity pins for owners . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find his own fraternity badge ( Sigma Phi ) . He has n't found it yet , but is still hopeful , and in the meantime has helped about fifty other fraternity men to their pins . He hunts in pawnshops , and has made a large fraction of his discoveries in two particular shops which seem , somehow , to be headquarters for fraternity pins : J. B. Koplik &; Company on Park Row , and the United Pledge Society , 843 Eighth Avenue . If he finds a pin that has the initials , chapter , and year of the owner on its back , he sets out to find him . He writes to the national secretary of the fraternity concerned and gets the last address of the owner . He then writes him direct . If the letter comes hack , he follows up the clue of the address and usually locates the owner anyhow . He tells him " I 've found your beautiful pin and I hope your spirit is not so dead you do n't care , " and also how much is due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hurrah , send it to me ; here 's the money , " " Do n't bother me ; I have too many troubles already , " and " I think you 're some kind of a crook and will tell the police if you pester me . " The first letter comes in more frequently if the national secretary , who naturally knows Mr. Hawley , has written and the owner knows all is well . In behalf of the skeptical frat brothers it may be said that mostly they have lost their pins through theft and are therefore suspicious . Once , the owner of a pin Mr. Hawley found started suit against Koplik &; Company . The pin had been stolen and the gentleman did n't see why he should pay for it . One of the Kopliks went to court and had to stay around all day waiting for the plaintiff to show up , which he never did . This upset Mr. Hawley quite a bit . The Koplik shop is now run by two sons of the house who are members of the Columbia chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their firm does so much frat-pin business . Mr. Hawley says that Fraternity men seldom pawn their own pins , that they would rather quietly starve if it comes to it . Koplik , to be sure , has a Phi Beta Kappa key pawned by the owner , but that is an exception . Next to theft as a cause for loss of pins come girls , although most young ladies drop in and redeem their pledges before thc school-holiday seasons . Just lately , one girl talked the United Pledge people out of ten dollars for a pin , saying that she was down from Ithaca and had lost her purse and would surely redeem it . She did , the next day . Once a girl from New Haven came into Koplik 's with twelve pins , being , apparently , a great favorite . She said she had to have a new gown , but would redeem the pins soon . She did , too . Lots of girls also buy pins ; sometimes , perhaps , to make an impression , but more often to replace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy up pins and hold them for the owner if he could n't be found readily . They do n't do it so much lately . Nor do the unidentified pins sell so well . The United people have a Sigma Chi with four diamonds and a Sigma Nu with eleven , and no market for them . Just lying around waiting for better days , like the rest of us . Love Story THE week 's sheaf of incidents that occurred in department stores contains only one we need bother you with . A Long Island woman had ordered a china dinner service as a wedding present for her niece , the gift to be sent to the bride-to-he 's home . The service was delivered as ordered , but a few days later the department store was asked to send for the set and take it back . Well , a lot of red tape was gone through with , the store regaining the dishes and refunding the amount of the purchase . The final paper that was filled out and filed in the case read " Reason for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before ceremony . Customer 's error . "
