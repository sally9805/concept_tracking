In gleaming Canada House-the Dominion 's splendiferous sandstone outpost facing London 's Trafalgar Square -representatives of the Big Four wheat exporting powers ( U. S. , Canada , Australia and Argentina ) bickered in exasperation last week with a Soviet Russian , bland , obstinate Comrade Abraham Gourevitch . <P> Comrade Gourevitch had just one answer to everything the Big Four asked Russia to do : " Why should we ? " The Big Four insisted that the Soviet Union , which did not sign the World Wheat Pact clause to raise prices by limiting exports next year ( TIME , Sept. 4 ) , must accept and abide by a reasonable quota . The Pact was signed on the assumption that Russia could not possibly export more than 50,000,000 bu . The signatories limited themselves as follows : Canada 200,000,000 bu. ; Australia 110,000,000 ; Argentina 105,000,000 ; U. S. 45,000,000 , the Danube countries 50,000,000 . <P> " Gentlemen , " said Comrade Gourevitch last week , " Russia must have an export quota of at least 75,000,000 bushels-at least ! " <P> The two U. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of St. James 's Robert W. Bingham and smart , sharp-nosed John Van Antwerp MacMurray , newly appointed Minister to Latvia , Estonia &; Lithuania , promptly tried to save the Wheat Pact by proposing to offer Russia a quota 8,000,000 bu. greater than her hypothetical allotment . <P> " But why should we take less than 75,000,000 bushels ? " shrugged Comrade Gourevitch . " Why should we ? " <P> Minister MacMurray , who is supposed to be President Roosevelt 's choice for Ambassador to Russia when the U. S. recognizes the U. S. S. R. , was in no position to answer Comrade Gourevitch bluntly . In Washington , however , threats were promptly heard that the R.F.C might find it necessary to refuse loans intended to finance exports of U. S. goods which Russia badly needs . Abruptly Mr. MacMurray , who was supposed to be merely " stopping off in London " en route to his Baltic post , announced that he had been called back to Washington , presumably to advise the President what to do about shrugging Comrade Gourevitch.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
