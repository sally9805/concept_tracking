O N November 14 the Labor Party gained 98 seats at the polls , and the Baldwin government was returned to power with a majority reduced , indeed , but still of 246 members . Even though each member on the government side of the House will represent only 27,000 voters as against 55,000 voters for each opposition member , this is unquestionably , from the progressive angle , a disappointing result . It means that for the next five years Mr. Baldwin , short of some unlooked-for catastrophe , will dominate the British scene . What is the explanation of the result ? Certainly , I think , no single cause but a number of contributory causes , the weight of each of which will vary according to one 's individual standpoint . Among them must be included : 1 . The absence of definite leadership in the Labor Party . Mr. Lansbury 's resignation just before the election dill grave harm . Mr. Attlee , his successor , did his best ; but as he was widely believed to be a merely temporary appointment , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a leader is imperative in an election here . For the absence of such a one the Labor Party paid a heavy price . In my own judgment hundreds of thousands of non-party voters supported Mr. Baldwin simply because they did not know what was involved in voting for the other side . 2 . An absence of clarity in the Labor Party attitude to foreign policy and rearmament . The official Labor view on the first was hardly distinguishable from that of the government , save as it attacked the record of Sir John Simon . On the second , if Mr. Baldwin asked for a blank check , the Labor Party 's promise of " adequate " armament was , in the absence of a specific program , at least equally vague . 3 . The record of the 1929 government . This was a heavy millstone round Labor candidates ' necks . We could not be defended by a party which stood for socialism . 4 . Fear . The electors , generally , felt that in a crisis such as this they had better trust the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voted Conservative in the hope partly that rearmament would mean work  --  for example , in the shipbuilding areas ; and ( b ) the tariff-protected areas like Birmingham and Leicester voted to keep the protection against foreign trade . 5 . Some weight must be given to distrust of the unions . Some of this lingers on from the general strike of 1926 and the election of 1931 . It was exacerbated by the claim of the unions , ruthlessly made at the Brighton conference of the Labor Party last October , to dominate the shaping of party policy . 6 . Certain minor causes are important . ( a ) There was poor local organization in many areas  --  for example , in Birmingham . ( b ) There were poor candidates badly chosen in others . I was myself sent to speak in behalf of at least four candidates for whom I should not myself have wished to vote . ( c ) The suddenness and brevity of the election hardly gave time for the making of Labor 's case . ( d ) In the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the government was definitely more skilful than Labor . Some aspects of the results deserve special emphasis . 1 . Labor will have a strong front bench ; almost all its tried leaders have been returned . But broadly speaking , its back benches will be unsatisfactory . There are too few young men . There are too many trade-union officials in the late fifties and sixties who have no special parliamentary contribution to make however well they may have served their unions . The Labor Party simply must find a way of bringing its young men early into the House if it wants to have a strong government next time . 2 . The Liberal Party is finished . It could only run 150 candidates for 615 seats ; it returned only 20 members . It lost its leader , Sir Herbert Samuel , and three of its whips . Forty-four of its candidates lost their deposits for failing to poll one-eighth of the votes cast in their respective constituencies . It has little hold on the electoral mind outside the west country . 3 . National Labor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new House compared to fourteen in the last , and all of these were elected by Tory votes . Mr. Malcolm MacDonald was well beaten ; Mr. Ramsay MacDonald by no less than 20,000 votes . Probably they will both continue in the government , but safe Tory seats will , if that be so , have to be found for them . 4 . The Simonite Liberals obtained twenty-one seats ; but they have become indistinguishable from the Conservatives . No doubt in the next few years they will be completely absorbed by the Conservative Party . 5 . For the first time since 1924 a Communist candidate was returned for the mining constituency of East Fife . 6 . The Fascists did not dare to run candidates at this election . It is , I think , safe to suggest that they are unlikely to develop any strength unless and until the Labor Party actually comes to power . The breakdown of conservatism might then give them a new significance . 7 . The real victors of this election were Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Eden . The first typified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a League of Nations policy in foreign affairs . They are the assets through whom the government obtains the support of the " mugwump " voters . 8 . Predominantly , the Liberal vote of 1929 appears to have gone to the government candidates . This is especially the case in the urban constituencies . Assuming that the Liberal voter is usually the older voter , the increase in the Labor vote is , I think , mostly that of younger electors who have become twenty-one since 1931 . In so far as this is so , it is , clearly , a hopeful sign for Labor . If ? I had to put the result succinctly , I should say that while the electorate had a strong feeling against the government , it was not convinced that the Labor Party could safely be intrusted with power . It felt this , I think , on three main grounds : ( a ) a doubt whether the time was ripe for experiment with untested principles ; ( b ) a doubt whether the Labor Party had the nerve or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give effect to its principles ; and ( c ) a conviction that , generally , the government had not done so badly and that , especially in an international crisis , there was no special reason to suppose that the Labor Party would do much better . What of the future ? I do not think anything is gained by concealing the fact that the result is a serious setback for Labor . It has now been out of office for four years ; if things remain pretty normal , especially abroad , it will be out of office for four more years . It must win the next election if it wants to remain the vital alternative to conservatism , for the simple reason that a political party under the parliamentary system dare not go on losing if it is to retain its hold on the electoral mind . What , then , has Labor got to do in the next four years ? 1 . It has got to find a leader , stick to him , and give him the chance given to Mr. MacDonald to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prime Minister . This can not be done too soon . Of the possible men of this type I believe that only Mr. Attlee or Mr. Herbert Morrison are genuinely available . Granted the conditions of the problem , I believe Mr. Morrison more valuable in this role because he has the more arresting personality . 2 . It has got to bring its young and able men into Parliament . That place , after all , is the one place where national political reputations are made . I know young men in the Labor Party who ought to be in the next Cabinet , but they are not in the House . 3 . It has got to make up its mind whether it is going to be a " social-reform " party or a " socialist " party . If the first , it will , logically enough , continue to be essentially trade-union in complexion ; but in this event it will only win in a period of relative prosperity when the economic situation permits the luxury of social reform within the framework of the present system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period ahead , and I think that a Labor government of this kind would bring us to another 1931 . Alternatively , if it is to be a " socialist " party , it must accept the logic of that position . It must then find a philosophy and fit its scheme of legislative priorities to that philosophy . It must avoid the appearance of wanting to " slip into " socialism and the pretense that a frontal attack can be made on capitalism without paying the price for it . The only philosophy that suits this alternative is Marxism ; and the Labor Party , if it wishes to be Marxist , must cease playing with the disillusioned Liberals who feel that there is a career in the Labor Party now that liberalism offers no constructive opportunities . Which choice the party will make I do not know with any confidence . Foreign affairs and the industrial position will do much to shape its decision . The one thing of which I am certain is that the party can no longer afford to be obscure about its outlook . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courage with which it makes the choice . 4 . The Labor Party has also to make up its mind about the meaning of fascist Europe on the one hand and of Soviet Russia on the other . To the first , its attitude is still the simpliste , " It ca n't happen here . " To the second , it still insists that British conditions are too different for Soviet experience to be significant . Both are the policies of the ostrich , and both are born of the refusal to understand that we are a world power enmeshed in a world system , and not an island power capable of isolation whenever we desire it . To confront these problems seriously means a drastic revision of Labor 's foreign policy in the concrete . Events may force this in the next twelve months . But it is the mark of a great party to anticipate the lesson of events . Corporate Tammany Halls WALTEALTER S.

Mr. Tower , in behalf of the steel industry , declined Major Berry 's invitation to a conference at Washington for the creation of a new NRA .

The fight against the Utility Holding Company Act illustrates the dominant trend . Since United Gas Improvement has led the parade in the refusal to register with the SEC , examination of its structure is pertinent . U. G I. declares that it does no interstate business , although within its huge system electric power is transmitted over eight state lines and gas over five . It asserts that all its companies are already regulated by state commissions , although one state commission after another has complained that effective regulation is hamstrung by the interlocking of operating with holding companies beyond state control . The need for supervision is demonstrated by testimony on the U. G. I. given before the Federal Trade Commission . U. G. I. collected $2,000,000 in management fees in 1928 and $1,500,000 in 1929 . It had more than $17,500,000 outstanding in cash advances to affiliated and subsidiary companies in 1929 . At one time it had as high as $500,000 outstanding in loans to its officers , in at least one case to purchase directors ' qualifying shares . All these loans may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its investors .

But United Corporatiqn itself was a device to make it possible for the Morgan utility group to capitalize on the stock-market boom and to finance their control with the savings of the public .

The same group sits on both sides of the table in fixing management fees , construction costs , andfinancing charges .

Such investments are hazardous in that they depend on continued control and/or continued evasion by utility companies of the regulatory agencies which fix the prices consumers must pay .
