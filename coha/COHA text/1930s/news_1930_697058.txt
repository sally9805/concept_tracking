txt The Interborough Rapid Transit Company , turned down by the Transit Commission in its plea for a tencent fare on its elevated lines , carried its fight yesterday into the State Supreme Court . A writ of certiorari , granted by Justice Nathan Bijur , opened the way to an Appellate Division review of the Transit Commission decision of Sept. 18 , 1929 , dismissing the higher fare application . The company 's certiorari petition , signed by Earl E. Starbard , vice president , was presented by Jacob H. Goetz , special counsel . Justice Bijur 's order , which was served on counsel for the commission , calls for submission of the entire record to the court within twenty days . The company filed its ten-cent fare application with the commission on June 19 , 1929 . There was a hearing on Aug. 1 . Then followed the commission 's decision , rejecting the application on the ground that it was in violation of injunctions issued by the Supreme Court in the seven-cent fare suits brought by the commission and the city against the Interborough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The request was denied on Dec. 4 , bringing the proceedings before the commission to a close . Samuel Untermyer , special counsel for the Transit Commission , said last night that the Interborough 's recourse to the State courts for a review of the ten-cent-fare case was a matter of routine procedure . " It means nothing , " he said . " except that the company is appealing to the court from the decision of the Transit Commission . There is nothing disturbing about it , and there is , in my judgment , no cause for anxiety as to the outcome . " Seven-Cent Fare Case Pending . The ten-cent fare case is to be distinguished from the seven-cent fare case now pending in the Supreme Court . It was brought by formal application under Section 49 of the Public Service Commission law and applies to the elevated lines only . The seven-cent fare case , in which Justice Phoenix Ingraham has reserved decision , was brought by filing new schedules under Section 29 of the same law and applies to both the subway and elevated lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . declared yesterday that the . recent Appellate Division decision upholding the Transit Commission 's rejection of seven-cent fare schedules filed under Section 29 by three surface car companies had no important bearing on the Interborough 's pending seven cent fare case . The Drydock case , " he said , referring to one of the three surface lines , " involved a procedural question rather than the general power of the commission under any provision of the Public Service Commission law to authorize an increased rate of fare , and the Appellate Division so decided . " That procedural question was not briefed or argued on either side upon the trial of the Interborough case aS to the subway and elevated fares before Justice Ingraham in the Supreme Court last October . " The seven-cent fare trial , according to Mr. Quackenbush , followed the di-1 rection of the United States Supreme Court that the Transit Commission s power to regulate the nickel fare fixed in the contract with the city should be determined , in the first instance , in the State courts . The litigation before Justice Ingraham , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Upon the trial of the Interborough case , " he said , " it was stated and agreed , by counsel for both sides , that the action involves broadly the question whether under any circumstances the rate of fare chargeable on either or both the elevated and the subway lines may be increased above five cents , pursuant to any of the procedures provided by the Public Service Commission law . There was no suggestion of the limitation of the issue to the procedural point involved in the Drydock decision . " Both the ten-cent and seven-cent fare cases will be pressed as speedily as possible , Mr. Quackenbush said , William L. Ransom , special counsel , will handle the litigation for the company . Charles Evans Hughes , who was recently confirmed as Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court , headed the list of counsel whose names appeared on the Interborough 's original application to the Transit Commission for the ten-cent fare on the elevated system .                  @ @ @
