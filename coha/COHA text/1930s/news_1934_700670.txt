The letter of resignation , addressed to the referee and read into the record by Sol Tekulsky , associated with former District Attorney Joab H. Banton in the defense of Justice Kunstler , follows : Hon. Frank C. Laughlin , County Court House . Dear Judge Laughlin : * I am herewith tendering my resignation as a Justice of the Municipal Court of the City of New York , Borough of Manhattan Second District . I wish to state that I feel that my usefulness as a judge of that court has been impaired and that it is in my own best interests therefore to resign . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to submit proofs of the various bank accounts which had been the subject-of previous hearings on the charges before you . I wanted particularly to place on record the fact that there were practical- ly no balances in these bank accounts . Now that I feel that I have given as full an explanation as was possible for me to do , I have therefore come to the conclusion that I now can with propriety resign my judicial office . I want to take this opportunity to thank yeti personally for your many courtesies , your extreme fairness at all times , and your consideration to me . Very truly yours , HAROLD L. KUNSTLER . After he had presented the letter , Mr. Tekulsky said : " Judge Kunstler desires an opportunity , which you have given him , to submit proofs of the moneys that were the subject of previous hearings in these proceedings . " He had contemplated resigning his judicial office some time ago , but in order to avoid any improper inferences being drawn from the existence of these bank deposits , he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first offering evidence in explanation thereof . " Having now submitted his explanations , he feels that he no longer need withhold his resignation and , inasmuch as it is his opinion that his usefulness on the bench has been impaired , he desires to and herewith does tender his resignation as a justice of the Municipal Court of the City of New York , Second District . " Calls Course Wise . " That is usually taken up by the Mayor 's office , is n't it ? " asked Referee Laughlin . " No. the City Clerk , " replied Mr. Tekulsky . After reading the letter , the referee said : " I want to say this , inasmuch as that ends the case , that I think that Justice Kunstler has taken the wise course . I would have been obliged to report for his removal , but very largely on the ground that his usefulness has been so seriously impaired that he ought not to remain on the bench . " There has been no evidence presented here which I consider proves that he has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had had as an associate one in particular with whom it was unwise for him to have been so intimate . I believe that his indiscretions in obtaining loans from Leef led Leef to attempt to impose upon him and try to make litigants bout the court room believe that he had , some influence with him , and in that way , without any proof that I see of actual corruption , he has allowed himself to be used by Leef in this manner to the detriment of the office and the prejudice of the public , so that the confidence that ought to be reposed by the public in judicial officers has been very largely lost and the confidence of the bar toward him has been very largely lost . No Evidence of Dishonesty . " There are some indiscretions of a more serious nature of which there is evidence here , but I want to say that , in my opinion , there is no evidence of actual corruption . I personally do not believe that this man is actually dishonest . There is no proof on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken a cent . He is one of those men who is loose in business methods in borrowing from Tom , Dick and Harry , and constantly in hot water , but there is no evidence here pointing to dishonesty . I want to say that since he has seen fit to take the tep , that relieves me as a referee and the Appellate Division of any further consideration of this case . " So I think , Mr. Dewey , that we are through . The only authority or KUNSTLER RESIGNS , STOPPING INQUIRY jurisdiction on the part of the Appellate Division is to remove such an officer . The power of removal is not like the power of impeachment . There is no authority to dliqUalify the man from afterward holding public office or to deprive him of his citizenship , as there is in impeachment cases , . which would warrant the impeachment court in continuing notwithstanding that the officer might resign . There is no power here except to remove a justice of this court , and you can not remove a man who has already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The referee stated that he assumed that Justice Kunstler had submitted his resignation to the Mayor or the City Clerk , and that " that terminates his judicial authority . " Mr. Dewey agreed and also concurred in Referee Laughlin 's conclusions that the proceeding had been terminated . Mr. Dewey declined to answer a question as to whether further steps would be taken as a result of the testimony brought out during the hearings , saying that his duties as counsel to the Bar Association had terminated . It was understood that a copy of the minutes will be sent to the District Attorney for any action he might see fit to take . He Will Open Office . Justice Kunatler 's resignation is effective as of today . He will open a . law office in the Paramount Building , he said . Justice Kunstler , who had been an assistant to District Attorney Banton in charge of the complaint bureau for several years , resigned a year before he was appointed by Mayor Walker on Feb. 29 , 1928 , to fill a vacancy in the Second Municipal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the following election . He entered public life as a prot5g5 of Edward Ahearn , Tammany leader of the Fourth Assembly District . The fact that the Bar Association was preparing charges against Justice Kunstler became known on Dec. 26 last , when Mr. Dewey , on surrendering the office of United States Attorney to Martin Conboy , announced that before resuming private practice he would serve as special counsel to the Bar Association without compensation in proceedings for Justice Kunstler 's removal . Mr. Dewey was chosen after Walter Pollak , who had been conducting the inquiry , was injured in a taxicab accident and was advised to withdraw .
