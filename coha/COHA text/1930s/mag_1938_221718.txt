After five months spent covering nearly all of Europe , able New York Times-woman Anne O'Hare McCormick last week returned to the U. S. keynoting " the imperturbable optimism of Great Britain , which worries less than any nation on earth . " That plenty of Britons were deliberately taking a humorous view of the European Crisis was a major fact in London last week . In the House of Commons , however , more seriousness was in evidence . In awful dignity the Prime Minister arose and spoke . " I do not deny , " came Neville Chamberlain 's solemn admission , " that my original belief in the League as an instrument of preserving peace has been profoundly shaken . " <P> The Prime Minister said that he would attempt to define the attitude of His Majesty 's Government . " I deliberately use the word ' attitude ' rather than policy , " he weightily continued , " because I can not imagine that any event would change the fundamental basis of British foreign policy , which is the maintenance and preservation of peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will in fact be maintained . " <P> It has been British policy from time immemorial , under Conservative , Liberal and Labor regimes , to avoid whenever possible the giving of a prior pledge which in certain circumstances would bring armed forces of the Empire automatically into play . While giving the House of Commons to understand last week that " in the case of France and Belgium " any German aggression will bring automatic British resistance to the aggressors , Neville Chamberlain was able to show that not even Anthony Eden advocated such an automatic arrangement in the case of Czechoslovakia . <P> Mr. Eden , one of the most socially-conscious aristocrats who have ever been British Foreign Secretary , once told the House , Mr. Chamberlain reminded his hearers , that " our armaments may be used in bringing help to the victim of aggression in any case where in our judgment it would be proper under the conditions of the League Covenant to do so . " The Prime Minister , indicating that His Majesty 's Government have not renounced that pledge , went on to quote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued : " I use the word ' may ' deliberately , since , in such an instance , there is no auto-matic obligation to take military action . It is , moreover , right that this should be so , for nations can not be expected to incur automatic military obligations save for areas where their vital interests are concerned . " <P> In ringing tones Orator Chamberlain cried : " His Majesty 's Government stand by these declarations ! " That pretty well took care of rumors of the week before that " Young Turks " hoped to turn out old Neville Chamberlain for failing to support Mr. Eden 's uncompromising hostility to aggressive Italy and Germany . The Commons cheered Mr. Chamberlain to the rafters and His Majesty 's Government were keel down once more .
