txt The CWA in Arkansas . I find the following matter in the editorial topics of The Conway ( Ark . ) Ne4vs : With orders to the CWA officials curtailing purchases for supplies in Conway , and centralizing , buying at State headquarters , and on top of it all the Federal Government distributing carloads of pork , butter , cheese , eggs , and other foodstuffs , what is to become of the local merchants ? His trade is curtailed perforce of the free distribution of necessaries which he formerly sold to consumers when employed , and with his opportunity to supply overalls , &c.,; to CWA workers wiped out how Is he going to " make ends meet " ? He appears to be the " Forgotten Man , " and Uncle Sam must provide for him nuickly or he will be tossed into the discard wherein the unemployed for a while rested . Is it possible that cause and effect are getting in their expected work ? DON C. SEITZ . Brooklyn . Jan. 29 , 1934.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
