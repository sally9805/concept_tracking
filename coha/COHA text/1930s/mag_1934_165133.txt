Mopping their honest faces on a sizzling Alberta afternoon , district leaders of the United Farmers Party met last week to pass political judgment on Provincial Premier John Brownlee , found guilty fortnight ago of " enticing and seducing " an Alberta Government stenographer , blonde Miss Vivian MacMillan ( TIME , July 9 ) . Crestfallen Premier Brownlee had nothing to say , but the judge before whom he had been tried had plenty . <P> A stickler for old-fashioned British Justice is Mr. Justice William Carlos Ives . Though unable to reverse the jury verdict convicting Premier Brownlee as an enticer and seducer , Justice Ives proceeded last week to dismiss the jury awards of $10,000 damages to Miss MacMillan and $5,000 to her father , a locomotive engineer for Canadian National Railways . <P> " No illness resulted from the seduction , " ruled Mr. Justice Ives . " It is well settled that damage is the gist of this action and no damage has been shown . The right of action of the woman must have the same basis as that of the master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no evidence that the ability of the daughter to render services was in any way interfered W1th . " <P> Such legal jargon made the Civil Liberties Protective Association see purple with fury . " This decision has set the clock back 300 years ! " stormed Civil Liberties President George D. Koe . <P> Meanwhile the United Farmers ' caucus , unimpressed by Mr. Justice Ives 's opinion that Miss MacMillan is as serviceable as ever , had accepted Premier Brownlee 's offer to spare the Party embarrassment by handing his resignation to the representative of George V in Alberta , Lieutenant Governor W. L. Walsh . No question of the United Farmers ' right to continue to rule Alberta was raised . His Majesty 's representative merely appointed another United Farmer , Richard Gavin Reid , Provincial Treasurer and Minister of Municipal Affairs and Lands and Mines , to carry on as Premier .
