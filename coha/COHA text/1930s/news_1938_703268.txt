txt Thirty years ago Herman Stoike was a ventriloquist . But Charlie McCarthy was a mere sapling in those days and ventriloquism was n't the high art that radio has made it . After a season or two on the stage Stoike gave up and became a policeman . Yesterday Wagon Man Stoike of the Damen avenue station volunteered to fix the windshield wiper on Supervising Captain John Ryan 's Packard , parked outside . He had just climbed in when a belathered gentleman came dashing from a barber ship , the cover cloth flapping from his neck , shouting : " Stop ! Thief ! Police ! Police ! " Grapples with " Thief . " He grappled with Stoike , who had forgotten that , as a wagon man , he did n't have on the uniform jacket . Policemen in the station heard the hubbub and came on the run : They pried Stoike from the grasp of his accuser and took them both inside . " This man tried to steal my car , " shouted the barber 's customer . " I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered disturbing catcalls and dog barks and the time that Stoike had used his , Blum 's , voice to call the lieutenant in the adjoining room a lunk head and a meddling fossil . He looked at Lieut . Patrick Knox . The lieutenant had suffered , too . " Lock him up , " said the lieutenant . " You ca n't do this to me , " yelled Stoike . " I was working on the captain 's car . " The Fun Goes On . " Did you ever see this crook before , sergeant ? " asked ' the lieutenant . " He looks like a burglar I saw at the bureau once , " the sergeant offered . " Look at him ? " the lieutenant began , but then there , came from his astonished lips the most fulsome praise and recognition of his old friend , Wagon Man Stoike . The sergeant keplkliis mouth shut ? no telling what an oldtime ventriloquist might do . He Motioned to the door and there suggested to the complainant that he ' go back and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . " Now , " said Stoike when the sergeant returned , " where 's : the captain 's Packard ? " They led him to the door . " There , " said the lieutenant , " is the captain 's car . He does n't drive a Packard any more . Since they made him a supervising captain he drives a Ford . Go fix it . "
