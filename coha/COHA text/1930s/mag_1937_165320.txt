Anything but simple is the great legal mind of the Rt . Hon. Sir John Allsebrook Simon , long the Empire 's highest-paid lawyer . But one day last week he was suddenly congratulated by almost every London newspaper on being the author of what Britons dubbed good-humoredly " Simple Simon 's Tax . " <P> Sir John , when he recently became Chancellor of the Exchequer , found himself in charge of a new tax trap designed for Rearmament profiteers but so objectionable to many potent Britons that there was nothing to do but hastily scrap the design . Its inventor was the Rt . Hon. Arthur Neville Chamberlain , now Prime Minister , who was Chancellor of the Exchequer when he introduced it in the House of Commons as the National Defense Contribution ( TIME , May 3 ) . This bill was to help hugely in paying for Rearmament by taxing of British firms on a sliding scale proportionate to the rate at which their profits have increased this year and continue to increase during Britain 's five-year Rearmament program . It was to soak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Chamberlain was harassed by more high-powered letters of complaint and suggestion personally signed by top bigwigs of British trade , industry and finance than he had received during his whole long career as Chancellor of the Exchequer . The final result last week , after anxious daily conferences between Mr. Chamberlain and Sir John , was " Simple Simon 's Tax . " <P> As a face-saver for the Prime Minister , Britain 's stiff new tax has the same name as the shelved tax trap : The National Defense Contribution . Irrespective of whether a firm 's profits are increasing so fast as to suggest " profiteering " or not , Simple Simon 's tax is to bear with equal weight on virtually all British firms with annual net profits of more than $10,000 per year . It is a supertax . Its intent is to raise the existing average 25% income tax on British firms to 29% in the case of partnerships , 30% in the case of corporations . Exempt from such super-taxing for Rearmament are to be salaried employes , doctors , lawyers , accountants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as $10,000 per year . <P> Simon 's Tax was announced to run retroactively from April 1 , 1937 for five years . After taking $10,000 as its profit base , it provides generous exemptions in the brackets up to $60,000 . Taxpayers with incomes up to that figure can deduct , in addition to their initial $10,000 exemption , one-fifth of the difference between their profits for the year and $60,000 . <P> Example : Jones , Ltd. earn $20,000 . One-fifth of the difference between that sum and $60,000 is $8,000 . So from their $20,000 income , Jones , Ltd. deduct $10,000 plus $8,000 and pay Simple Simon 's Super Tax of 5% on $2,000 of profits , over and above their normal 25% tax on $20,000 . <P> In cynical Parliamentary circles , Prime Minister Chamberlain and his Chancellor were said to have turned tail and ducked before the storm of aroused Big Business .
