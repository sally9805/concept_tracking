txt The ghosts o ; " 's ' Suicide Hall , " the once notorious . " Tub of , Blood " and other such establishments of yesteryear along New York 's Bowery were brought before the House Judiciary Committee today as eVidence of the good prohibition has wrought in that city . These . evil spirits of . the years before 1920 were called up by the Rev. John Callahan , superintendent of Hadley Rescue Hall , 293 Bowery , a mission and home for " down-andouts , " and chaplain of the Tombs prison . Mr. Callahan is commonly known as " the Bishop of the Bowery , " and also as " Uncle John . " He is a local preacher in the Methodist Church . Mr. Callahan said that prior to ten years ago forty-four such saloons as he described were to be found along the Bowery , and the place was strewn with human derelicts . He did not deny that that section of the city still had its poor , but he said that he knew many who before 1920 had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were now respectable citizens , with good families and good homes . This he credited to prohibition . " I hope to God the dry law will stay on the books and he more consistently enforced , " said Mr. Callahan . Mr. Callahan was an unusual figure before the committee . He was a New Yorker of a type heard of but seldom seen by a number of the committee members and many of those in the committee room . He told of his early life in New York . How , as a native of the lower east side , he started life in an environment which made it easy for him to take to liquor at the age of 9 . He told the committee that it was the influence of " dear old grandmother " that started him right , after he had been almost ruined by the saloon . If he had continued , he said , " I would now be in hell . " But he told of his change , and recalled his thirty-nine years as a missionary on the same lower east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hang-outs that would ring familiarly in the ears of an . old Bowery habitue . The grayhaired mission worker spoke rather feelingly of " Onie Gagan 's , " right next door to the Hadley Rescue Mission , where he spent so many years , and referred to whole groups of barrooms in other sections along the lower east side . " There were forty-four saloons between Park Row and Second Street , " said the " Bishop , " but they dwindled to six the year following prohibition . There is n't a saloon in the Bowery today . " When you think of the reputation that the Bowery had in years , past and the mighty change that has taken place there during the last ten it only goes to show that the law and the gospel make mighty changes . Why , in my neighborhood , between Houston and Bleecker Streets , there were nine saloons on the block . They are all gone , and the boys and girls who used to go bad are a thing of the past . " I 've seen hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendless in the old days , but today they 've got homes , wives , children , bank accounts , autos , radios and life insurance . Ten years ago they were without God and without hope . " Robins Says Country Is Dry . The first witness today was Raymond Robins , social worker of Chicago , who declared that the wet bills before Congress do not have a " Chinaman 's chance " of passage because " Congress and the country are dry in sentiment and getting drier in fact . " Mr. Robins declared that both major political parties were dry and dared not be otherwise , and asserted that Alfred E. Smith was defeated for President largely because of his stand on prohibition . " The Republican party pledges itself and its nominees to the observance and vigorous enforcement of the Eighteenth Amendment , " he quoted from the Republican platform of 1928 , and from the Democratic pronouncements he read : " This convention pledges the party and its nominees to an honest effort to enforce the Eighteenth Amendment and all other provisions of the Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even the wets piously declare that they do not want the saloon , " said Mr. Robins , " but a rose by another name is still a rose . The saloon is simply a place where men drink liquor and more liquor  --  and modification , the Canadian system or straight-out repeai , would bring us the saloon again in one form or air othe ? ? even if we painted it white , sold lilies at the door and had Uncle Sam for a bartender . Long Fight Traced . " Prohibition came by the most definite Anglo-Saxon and American method . It was the longest drawnout fight and discussion in the history of this country . It began with the first temperance agitations in Boston in 1826 . " Proh:bition be ; an with local option in towns and villages , then counties . and then states . until twenty-three sovereign Commonwealths had prohibited liquor by State enactment . Then came national prohibition . Why ? Because wet States would not allow dry States to be dry ; because the liquor traffic would not play the game ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the people is ultimately forced to yield to national consideration and treatment ; witness slavery , Federal pure food laws , Federal anti-drug laws , interstate commerce control and the rest . " True enough , it might have been better if the States had solved the problem themselves , but they did not solve it , and whether you like it or not this country has come to think on general fundamental problems along national rather than State lines . There is no need of going over that ground because you could not change the national psychology in that regard if you would . " Congress " Becoming Drier . " " President Hoover will win on this issue every time , " said Mr. Robins . " Congress as a whole will win on this issue every time . Each Congress since the adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment has been drier than the preceding and the present Congress is the driest of them all . That is not an accident . President Hoover has well said : " ' No individual has the right to determine what law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If a law is wrong , its rigid enforcement is the surest guaranty of its repeal . If it is right , its enforcement is the quickest method of compelling respect for it . ' We will take our chances on that doctrine . " Mr. Robins said that prohibition came for five principal reasons : The moral adventure of America seeking a better human life , the closing of the frontier and the urban movement , the extension of general education and scientific knowledge , the rise . pf the standard of living and the means of healthful recreation because of the eight-hour day , and the automobile and other modern developments of the machine age . " A driver asleep in a lumber wagon is a different social factor than a driver drunk behind the wheel of an auto , " Mr. Robins observed . " If ever there was a personal liberty to get drunk , that liberty is lost . " " Wet Press " Criticized . Mr. Robins added a criticism of the " wet metropolitan press " for keeping the prohibition question stirred up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editorializing in the news columns of great papers supporting the wet side and that the newspaper activities stirred up discussion but changed no opinion . The " noisy 20 per ' lent , " Mr. Robbins said , " created the scare of disregard for the law . " Representative La Guardia interrupted to say that there was too much liquor being drunk for the 20 per cent to do it all . " There is an increase in crime in our nation , " Mr. Robins said . " This is a fact . But the reason given is false . In all the nations that participated in the great war we find an increase in crime . We are the only one of these to outlaw the liquor traffic . Therefore , the crime and lawlessness of this hour must have another and universal cause . " We need not seek far . Here is an aftermath , a backwash of the great war . Millions of the youth of great nations , taught to disregard the life and property of the alien . now allow their appetites and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of force and disregard for law and authority . " Mission Heads Endorse Law . Another witness was John R. , superintendent of the Whosoever Gospel Mission of Germantown , Pa . Mr. followed Mr. Robins in support of the dry law , declaring that his mission had observed a change for the better . Frank Dippel of the Brotherhood Mission of Philadelphia also told of the cleaning-up of " Old Fishtown " some years ago . Ralph H. White of New Haven , research secretary of the Fact-Finding Commission on Law Enforcement in Connecticut , a private organization which he said was headed by Horace D. Taft , brother of the late Chief Justice , related how his organization had made a survey of drinking among the young people of Connecticut through a questionnaire sent to high school principals . Only one high school head , he said , listed drinking as a problem in discipline , and only one said that he believed some modification would better conditions . Mr. White said he regarded the liquor law as one of the easiest to enforce . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convictions in liquor cases , much more , he said , than for reckless driving . " It is only the bootlegger who violates other laws , " Mr. White declared . " He commits conspiracy , bribery , perjury , forgery , and sometimes murder that he may make bootlegging a paying business . " More Drinking in Fraternities . The witness said that a further survey by his organization showed that there is now more drinking in college fraternities than in former years , and probably as much drinking by students in their rooms . " There is a noticeable change , however , in the character of the present students who drink , " he said . " The youth who drink today are characteristic of the kind of boys who like to drink with women and are not averse to doing things surreptitiously . " There is a difference of opinion among the Yale deans regarding the adviu.bility of the ? Eighteenth Ameffdment and also the effects of the liquor laws on the character of ttihneuesdtu. student body , " Mr. White con " At Wesleyan University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attitude of the students and faculty toward drinking , so that at present they have only about one disciplinary case in a body of 600 students . There is some clandestine drinking , however , especially associated with returning alumni and fraternity life . " Says Canada Observes Laws . Mr. White said that the law enforcement system of Canada , particularly its results and the attitude of the country at large toward law observance , was so far ahead of the United states that this country could well afford to double the national debt to obtain it . As for the permit system and the beer bars in Quebec , however , he said they were no solution of the liquor problem . " They do not prevent bootlegging , " said Mr. White , " and drinking has steadily increased under them and crime related to drink is rather alarmingly on the increase in these Provinces . " At the conclusion of the testimony today the committee adjourned the herrings until next Wednesday . Reprezantetive Graham , chairman of the committee , said that the mass of testimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions under prohibition were not as bad as he thought at the opening of the hearings . " There are two arguments here , " he said , " one wet and one dry . I do not know the conclusion between the two or the middle ground to be sought , but I do know that there is evidence of undesirable conditions existing , and an effort ought to be made to bring about a change . Of course , there have been but two suggestions , repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment and a method of government liquor control . "
