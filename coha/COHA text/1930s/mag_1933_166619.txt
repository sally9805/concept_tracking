Steel is proverbially a " feast or famine " industry . Last week National Steel doubled its dividend . U. S. Steel reported a 65,241-ton rise in its backlog of unfilled orders to 1,929,815 tons . Operations for the industry as a whole jumped to 45% of capacity-highest rate in more than two years. * Cheery indeed are steelmen when their backlogs keep swelling while their furnaces grow hotter . <P> Brightest spot in the steel picture is motor-making Detroit . Thence has come the bulk of the demand that more than tripled steel operations in the last three months. + Makers of automobile steel like National Steel ( only major unit to pay dividends throughout the Depression ) have come nearest to feasting . In the Detroit district steel operations have surged up to nearly 80% of capacity . <P> In Cleveland where plants were booming at 77% of capacity , talk of steel mergers was sprouting again last week-sure sign of a jubilant industry . It concerned no Bethlehem-Youngstown merger but it did deal with the scattered relics of Cyrus Eaton 's industrial empire-big Republic with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Corrigan-McKinney Steel . Interest was added to this report by the fact that a block of 50,000 shares of Cliffs Corp . which controls Corrigan-McKinney was included in the collateral that Cyrus Eaton put up for a big loan from Chase National Bank in 1931 . Chase auctioned off that collateral this week . <P> Operations in the biggest steel districts - Pittsburgh and Chicago-have dragged down the U. S. average . Most companies can break even at 35 to 40% of capacity but for only a few will this mean a second quarter profit . Low April operations will more than offset the recent expansion . Nevertheless , U. S. Steel preferred was last week within a few points of par and the common at 56 had more than doubled its Old Deal low . <P> In Birmingham , mills were running at about the average for the industry , in Youngstown slightly above at 48% . But what concerned steelmen most last week was prices and wages . Buyers last week found it nearly impossible to place orders for the third quarter . There were persistent reports that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a general upping of all steel prices . <P> If steelmen have eyed Detroit with pleasure in the past two months , they have also eyed it with alarm . There H. M. Naugle and A. J. Townsend have a plant abuilding . Messrs . Naugle &; Townsend once revolutionized a good section of the industry with their continuous sheet steel rolling mill-only new steelmaking process adopted by the industry in the past 41 years . And steelmen knew that what they had done once they might do again . The new Naugle-Townsend plant is to test the commercial possibilities of casting steel by the rotary method . Chief advantages : <P> 1 ) It eliminates three steps from molten steel to finished product-ingots , soaking pits , blooming mills . <P> 2 ) It makes non-dendritic ( homogeneous ) steel . In a cast ingot the interior pressure created by the more rapidly cooling exterior forms segregated crystalline structures which may weaken the steel . <P> 3 ) It is more efficient-about 20% of an ordinary bloom is cropped off to remove flaws against 2% in rotary casting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
