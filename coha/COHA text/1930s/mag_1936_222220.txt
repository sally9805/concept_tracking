One evening last week William Edgar Borah stood on the platform in the " million-dollar ballroom " of the Eagles Lodge in Milwaukee with 1.200 Wisconsin voters ranged on chairs before him . From their standpoint the occasion was significant because the Idaho Senator was the one candidate for President who had seen fit to show himself in the flesh in their State . From his standpoint the occasion meant : 1 ) an expenditure of about $10 , the cost of a round-trip ticket from Chicago and a night 's lodging at Milwaukee 's Republican Hotel ; 2 ) a one-night campaign to capture a State 's support ; 3 ) the first thorough and the easiest test in his attempt to win the Republican nomination . <P> Next morning Wisconsin voters went to the polls to ballot in their Presidential primaries . As simple as the Nazi ticket in Germany was the first choice offered . Those who voted in the Democratic primary were given the choice of Franklin D. Roosevelt . Those who voted in the Republican primary were given the choice of William E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a matter of great importance , for this Presidential preference vote was really no more than a popularity rating . The real test was on delegates to the two national conventions . On the Democratic ticket was a complete slate of Roosevelt delegates . Republicans had a choice between a slate of Borah delegates or a slate of uninstructed delegates put up by the regular Republican organization in an attempt to reserve Wisconsin 's freedom of action at the Republican convention . Under Wisconsin law any qualified voter can vote at wall in any party 's primary . Thus the La Follette Progressives , who have officially detached themselves from the Republican Party , had the choice of voting for Left-winger Borah or for New Dealer Roosevelt . <P> Apparently most Progressives favored the latter choice , for President Roosevelt polled more than two votes for every one polled by Senator Borah in the preference primary . The Borah vote did not represent the full Republican strength because the regular Republicans opposed to the Senator presumably did not vote at all in this popularity contest . Not well educated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 who went to the polls bothered to ballot for delegates , the only thing that counted . In that vote the Roosevelt delegates won easily . The four Borah delegates-at-large won over uninstructed delegates about 5-to-4 . Result : Of Wisconsin 's 24 delegates Candidate Borah now counts 21 as his . <P> Encouraged by gathering these first delegates in his collection for Cleveland , Senator Borah returned to Chicago , spent the rest of the week stumping Illinois-in preparation for this week 's primary there . Meanwhile Carl Bachmann , his national manager , optimistically entered him in West Virginia 's primary ( May 12 ) . <P> But one State does not make a landslide . Of some 300 delegates who up to this week had been picked to go to Cleveland , three-quarters are officially uninstructed . Of the 1,001 delegates who will eventually assemble at the convention it is certain that the great majority , despite private commitments , will not be under official instructions from their party at home . Therefore they should be swung with relative ease in any direction the tide runs strongest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
