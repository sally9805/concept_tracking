Even if it were not one of the cheapest and easiest methods of reproduction of a draughtsman 's work , lithography would be popular with artists because of the purely tactile pleasure of drawing in crayon on smooth stone . Since its discovery 139 years ago , this youngest of the great printmaking processes has been a valued sideline of many an important European and U. S. painter , the mainstay of at least one indubitable master , Honore Daumier . In spite of having cluttered up the earth with a God 's plenty of " chromos , " + it has remained a fine as well as a commercial art . At the Boston Museum of Fine Arts last week 527 of the handsomest prints that have been pulled from stone since 1799 gave visitors an eyeful of old and new scenes and artistry in the largest exhibition of lithographs yet hung in the U.

Plate engraving is supposed to have been discovered when someone threw a heap of wet linen over a steel cuirass , later found it patterned from the intaglio work on the steel . Albrecht Drer was reputedly driven to the solace of wood blocks by his wife 's demeanor after her hard day 's washing . More recent and not at all apocryphal is the account handed down by Johann Nepomuk Franz Aloys Senefelder , a ragtag Bavarian actor &; playwright , of the fretful day in 1796 when he was so poor he had neither paper nor ink with which to write his laundry list . Senefelder. whose plays no one would print , had been trying to make himself his own engraver by practicing writing backward on slabs of limestone which he picked up around Munich . In wax , backward , he wrote the laundry list on a piece of stone , reflected afterward that if the stone were bitten away with acid around the wax he could ink it and get an impression . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
