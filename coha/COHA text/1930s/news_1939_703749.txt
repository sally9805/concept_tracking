txt The action talZen yesterday by the British Exchange Equalization Fund and the Bank of England appears to mean that the steady and heavy drain of gold from London to New York had nearly exhausted the Equalization Fund 's gold holdings . That fund . established in 1932 and twice enlarged afterward , had for its purpose protection of the pound sterling from sudden or undue depreciation on international exchange . It performed the office through using its resources , first to accumulate gold in its own hands , then , when an export demand for gold was large , through paying out gold in purchase of sterling bills  --  thus providing gold required for export . But when demand for export gold was exceptionally large , and continuous , the Equalization Fund was drawn upon heavily . At the end of last March , the Fund 's gold holdings , which are reported quarterly , stood in British values at ? 297,500,000 , which was nearly half of the Fund 's total money resources . From this amount , it declined to ? 151 , - 800,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sterling , which was then due largely to our own country 's huge merchandise export balance . The " war panic " followed , with almost unprecedented flight of European capital to America . The sterling rate , which had ruled above $5 early in the year , plunged down to $4.60 on Sept. 28 ; its decline had started an export of gold from London to New York which , in September , reached ? 74,900 , - 000 , and which , in the three last months of 1938 , footed up ? 150,000,000 more . Not all of this gold was obtained from the Equalization Fund ; but the temporary recovery of sterling from $4.60 to $4.84 at the end of September , and from ; R to $4.70 early in December , reflected mostly the Fund 's operations . In conducting them , it was undoubtedly obliged to convert into British currency most of the f151,800 , - 000 gold which it still held on Sept. 30 . Evidently , the time had come for replenishing its gold resources . In 1936 , when gold was moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much larger than seemed to be needed , considerable amounts of its gold were transferred to the Bank of England . It was there used as a basis for new circulation , which at the time was in high demand . In December , 1936 , the Bank bought outright ? 65,000,000 of this gold ; in all , its gold holdings rose in two years some ? 126,000,000 to ? 327,000,000 . It is now proposed to reshift from the Bank to the Equalization Fund ? 200,000,000 of this gold . Evidently , possession of these largely increased gold resources will enable the Fund to continue , and perhaps enlarge , its operations to protect or advance the international sterling rate . Usually there is a strong recovery in sterling at this time of year . Neither last year 's merchandise export surplus in our own foreign trade , nor an imminent war scare to provoke flight of European capital , is at this moment an active cause . How the Bank of England is affected by the retransfer of gold is clarified by London cables . Of its 1500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ? 230,000,000 is " fiduciary " ? that is to say , is based on highest grade securities  --  the rest has been secured at face value in gold . But to surrender ? 200,000,000 of its ? 327,000 , - 000 gold to the Equalization Fund has so far altered the set-up as to necessitate extensive increase of that portion of the note issue which will be fiduciary circulation .
