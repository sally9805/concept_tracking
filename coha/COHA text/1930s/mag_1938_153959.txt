On Cody , Wyoming 's Main Street , across from the Buffalo Bill Bar , stands the Cody Theatre . Mostly , the Cody sticks to single features . But last fortnight it went on a tear . " Can You Take It ? " the theatre 's advertisement in the Cody Enterprise inquired . It then listed Saturday 's bill . " Seven features , no show twice , " starting at 2:30 p.m. , ending at 10:40 . Folks came from all over Park County , at the theatre 's invitation brought their lunches , stuck around till closing time .
