The sabre and the epee are warlike weapons , too unwieldy for women to handle . The lady fencers who attacked each other last week on the strips of the New York Fencers Club did it with light foils , buttoned at the tip . Last year 's champion , Dorothy Locke of the Salle d'Armes Vince , lost her bout in the semi-final strip against Amy von Hansa , a blonde from the German-American Athletic Club , but both of them qualified , with Marion Lloyd and Mrs. Norman Taylor Jr. , for the final round-robin . <P> Marion Lloyd , Miss Locke 's clubmate who won the title in 1928 and 1931 , fences with classic style and admirable poise , but flashing speed has lately enabled Miss Locke to beat her . She did it last week not quite so easily as the score suggested , 5-1 , then came up against Miss von Hansa for the second time . It was a terrific bout . Finally at 4-all Miss Locke , attacking steadily , reached a climax of speed which her adversary could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the championship for another year , because all three of the finalists beat Mrs. Taylor . <P> Miss Lloyd and Miss von Hansa had another lively set-to for second place , which went to Miss Lloyd , 5-4 again , after more than five minutes of brilliant fencing to decide the last point . <P> Dorothy Brown Locke took up fencing five years ago when she was 16 because her father , a Manhattan mathematics teacher , disapproved of her posture . Joseph Vince , to whose Salle d'Armes Mr. Locke sent her , saw very little promise in Dorothy ; her knees wobbled , she had poor coordination . She practiced three hours at a time , three times a week , became a close friend of Marion Lloyd who , another Vince pupil , has the soundest technic among U. S. woman fencers . Dark-haired , calm , utterly unromantic , Fencer Locke trains on as much chow-mein as she can eat , never loses her temper in a bout . In her autograph collection she prizes most highly the signature of Helene Mayer , the German Army officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now studying in California . <P> By winning her second championship in a row last week , Dorothy Locke enhanced her chance of equalling the record of Adeline Gehrig , cousin of famed Baseballer Lou Gehrig and only woman to win the U. S. title four times running ( 1920-1923 ) . To do so Dorothy Locke will have to ward off the challenge of stubby Muriel Guggolz , another Salle d'Armes Vince student and teammate with Locke and Lloyd on last year 's U. S. Olympic team . A studious and prudent , albeit preternaturally sly , lady with a foil , little Miss Guggolz was not fencing for the championship last week ; she was unexpectedly eliminated in the trials last fortnight .
