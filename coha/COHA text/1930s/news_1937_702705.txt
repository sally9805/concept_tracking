txt Blasting the administration 's appeal f o r ... : .. Senntor Wheeeler . Charges Backers are Afraid . Senator Wheeler also challenged he administration to permit free and unlimited legitimate debate on the compromise one-judge-a-year packing scheme , charging that the proponents were crying " filibuster " and invoking strict application of the most drastic senate rules because " they are afraid of real debate . " ' Why did not the administration permit a vote on the President 's original bill , calling for a six-judge packing operation , Senator Wheeler wanted to know . " Mr. Farley said , ' We have the votes . It is in the bag , " ' the senator continued . " If it was in tile bag , and the only bill that should come before us , and no compromise should be made , why did they desert the original bill ? Because the great prophet of the Democratic party was wrong . They did not have the votes . They have not got the votes now . They do not want this bill debated because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Recalls Robinson Admission . " They know that while they undoubtedly had 60 voles in favor of the original bill at the outset , the one proposing to add six new justices to the Supreme court , after the members of the senate heard and saw the witnesses and read the testimony before the judiciary committee , and after they heard the debates upon the bill , one by one , then two by two , then three by three and four by four , they deserted that bill . And day before yesterday the Democratic leader , Mr. Robinson , announced that the reason why they did not try to put forward the other bill was because they did not have the votes to pass it . " They say they have the votes at the present time for the compromise // support 0 President Roose velt ' s court packing project on the ground o f party loyalty , Senator : Burton K. WheelerD. , Monl .. 1 , told h i s Democratic col. leagues Loday that " those o f you who rode in on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his coat tails if that is the on reason you a rP here . " Senator Wheeler , i he first speaker for the opposition as debate on the court packing proposai proceeded into the fourth clay , made the most of the aciministration 's reluctance to detend the bill on its merits , and ridiculed the contention that all those Democrats rode in on the President 's coat tails had better support it or else . proposal , and they come here and appeal to party loyalty . They say to you senators who have just been elected , you ought to vote for this bill because you rode in on the coat tails of the President of the United States . Not Roosevelt Bill , He Says . " Thank God I did not ride in on the coat tails of the President of the United States , " Finally , we were told , if you do not vote for this bill you will break the President 's heart . " 0 , ' dear what a pity , you are going to break the President 's heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Well , if senators are going to break- the President 's heart because they do not vote for him on this bill , they ought to go back and vote for six judges instead of voting for the substitute , because this is not the President 's bill . 0 , no , this , is not his bill . This is not what the President wanted . He wanted six new judges . " And why did he want six new judges ? Because some of the pro . ponents of the original bill said , ' We can not trust less than four judges , and we ought to have six because some of the six might go back on us , so we have to have six , and it we can not get six , the least we will take is four . ' Challenge Senator Logan . " But finally they have come down and said , ' We do not want six all at one time . That was wrong . That was packing the court , so now , instead of packing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow motion , and we will get the same result . ' " Senator Wheeler had been replying , up to this time , to the " ceat tail " and party loyalty argument made by Senator Marvel M. Logan ED. , Ky.j , manager of the compromise proposal . He then walked over to Logan 's desk and recalled " the Kentucky wonder 's " threat to " throw some dead cats " if the opposition leaders wanted to get rough . Shaking his finger at Logan , the tall , lanky Montanan said : " If you have any dead cats to throw at me go ahead and throw them . I 've had dead cats thrown at me and I 've had dead animals that smelled worse than cats thrown at toe . Bat 1 do n't propose , and the other opponents of this bill do n't propose , to be intimidated by threats . Go ahead and throw your dead cats . " Adversary Shakes Head . Senator Logan grinned sheepishly and shook his head . Senator Wheeler then recalled that Senator Joseph F. Gurley ED. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ad ? ministration 's propaganda bur ea u , " got up here the other day and made a violent attack upon the chief justice of the United States , He said he is a terrible politician , " Where have I heard those words before ? Not from the senator from Pennsylvania , but from some of the proponents of this bill who are not members of the senate . The men who first proposed this bill were the first ones to use that term . " Then , walking over toward the seat of Majority Leader Joseph T. Robinson , Senator Wheeler continued : " But if Chief Justice Hughes is such a- terrible politician , and we should bar politicians from the Supreme court , why is it that the members of the senate of the United States all joined in recommending our distinguished leader here for the existing vacancy cn the Supreme court ? It we were not politicians , we would not be in the senate of the United States . The only statesmen are those who are dead . " Robinson Unable to Reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rigid rules he himself had invoked , sat silently with his hands over his face . Senator Wheeler denounced the " bigotry " and " intolerance " with which the administration had waged its tight to pack the court . Never before in the history of the United States had there been such appeals to prejudice , he declared . he assailed the propaganda activities of Relief Administrator Harry L. Hopkins , " the man with all the money to spend ; " of Postmaster General James A. Farley , of Attorney General Homer S. Cummings , and " that great liberal , Mr. Ickes , the secretary of the into . rior. " - " Whoever heard of Ickes before he came down here seeking a job as commissioner of Indian affairs ? " Senator Wheeler asked .
