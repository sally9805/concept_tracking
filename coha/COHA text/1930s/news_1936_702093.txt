txt The present Government of Alberta was elected a year ago on the promise that it would create a paradise of Social Credit , in which every adult would get $25 a month from the Government in addition to his regular income . The era of Social Credit is yet to begin , but meanwhile the Government has printed $250,000 in $1 denominations of scrip , or " prosperity certificates , " which it is paying out to labor working on its road program and to such officials as agree to accept some of it . It works this way : The Government uses the scrip as money to pay its bills . On the back of each certificate are 104 squares , each marked with a weekly date until August of 1938 . Whoever is caught holding the bill on one of these dates must affix a 1-cent stamp in the square marked for it . Thus altogether over a period of two years $1.04 of stamps will have been affixed to the back of the note . At the end of the period the Government promises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sponsors of this plan grow starry-eyed when they discuss its merits . First of all , the Government gets money that it would not otherwise have had . Then it distributes this " increased purchasing power " to the community . The money circulates furiously , because everybody wants to get rid of it before the next stamp becomes due ; this velocity of circulation stimulates business . It is not inflation , because the money is redeemed in two years ; and from the proceeds of the stamp sales the Government gets the money to redeem it , plus 4 cents extra on every bill to cover the cost of administration . The worldly will suspect a catch somewhere , and they need not look far . These so-called " prosperity certificates " are simply a form of taxation , and not very equitable taxation . Assuming that the scrip circulates at face value and is duly redeemed , the people of Alberta will none the less pay $1.04 in stamp taxes for each dollar of scrip issued . No " increased purchasing power " is created ; the citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not on those best able to pay but merely on those who get caught with the bills on the weekly stamp day . Some persons may be able to arrange their transactions to avoid the tax regularly , while others are just as regularly caught , unless they can add the , tax to their prices . Except that the two schemes appeal to the same type of mind , it is fair to say that these " prosperity certificates " have nothing to do with Social Credit . The latter originated in the mind of a British major named DouGlAs ; the intellectual father of the scrip is a German writer , SILvIo GESELL . It first appears to have been tried at the depth of the depression in the Austrian town of Woergl . It was tried in some American towns in 1933 . Hawarden , Iowa , put out a scrip issue to the dollar denominations of which a 3-cent stamp , sold by the City Clerk , was to be affixed each time the scrip was used in a transaction ; when thirty-six stamps had been placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Asbury Park and Atlantic City all issued scrip during the depression , but this represented merely forced loans ; there were no stamp taxes . In virtually every case scrip schemes were promptly abandoned when the credit of the towns concerned was restored .
