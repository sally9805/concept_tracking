As thunderclouds of difficulty so often do when " Europe 's Smartest Little Statesman , " Dr. Eduard Benes , arrives on the scene , the gathering storm of petty opposition among lesser Czechoslovak politicians to his election as President ( TIME , Dec. 23 ) magically cleared on the great day last week . The local Nazis , Fascists and Extreme Rightists sulkily cast 76 blank ballots as the National Assembly polled . The Czech Agrarian Party threw away 24 more by voting for the only candidate who opposed Dr. Benes , a botanist-spellbinder named Bohumil Nemec . All other ballots , totaling 340 , went to make President Benes . <P> Snug in Milwaukee a retired cabinetmaker received the news with joy . Said John Benes : " I was the second in our family of eight children . Eduard , my little brother , was only six years old when I left home-it was in Austria then-and came to America in 1889 . I was the only-one to come here . I did not know until a few years ago the hardships Eduard went through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have helped him because I always made good money . But he never told me . Often in Germany , England and France he went without enough to eat so that he could learn . Always he read and studied . He had little time for play . Sometimes he would write to me from France or Germany for American books and I would send them to him . He would translate them to make a little money . <P> " Three times I have been home , and I learned how the people of Czechoslovakia love brother Eduard . I saw him on these visits , but never for long . He was always so busy , always doing so much for his country . I knew he would be President , I always knew . He will make a great President .
