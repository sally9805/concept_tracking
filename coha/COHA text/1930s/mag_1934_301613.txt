COSSACK GIRL - Marina Yurlova - Macaulay ( $2.50 ) . <P> Though Marina Yurlova now dances for her suppers on the concert stage she once did a more dangerous pas seul . Readers of Cossack Girl may find it easier to read than believe , but Publisher Macaulay insists Authoress Yurlova 's hairbreadth narrative is " authenticated by documents . ' ' No less credible than Joan Lowell 's notorious Cradle of the Deep , Cossack Girl is a thriller of the same order , but better written . <P> According to Authoress Yurlova 's tale , she left her home in Raevskaya at 14 followed her father , a Colonel of Cossacks , to the War . She never found him , but enough else came her way to keep her busy . A kindly Cossack fitted her into a uniform , had her hair cut and soon she was doing a soldier 's share . Twice recommended for the Cross of St. George , she was wounded , captured by Kurds , shellshocked . When the Revolution broke the Bolsheviks caught her in a hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Czechoslovaks who had joined the Whites , she shared the retreat of the Czechs across Siberia , escaped from Vladivostok to Japan . <P> Whether Authoress Yurlova 's story is embroidered , it pales into romantic unreality beside the photographs that illustrate it . Among its gory snapshots of corpses cluttering the snow , frozen into the many awkward postures of Death , one stands out as the most ghastly yet published in any war book . It is labeled an execution in Kazan . Backed against the rough-hewn wall of a log cabin eleven men , most in underclothes , barefoot , one half-naked , are standing in the snow . The volley ( whose echo Authoress Yurlova compares to " an immensely swift flight of pigeons across the yard " ) has just crashed . The camera 's shutter has caught the eleven bullet-riddled victims in the act of falling . One is arched up , head back , on tiptoe . One , with a long beard , has turned sideways , looks like a figure on a Greek frieze . One man 's knee is drawn up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every man 's chest is blotted with dark stains . Though they are all still on their feet , the whole line , knocked reeling against the cabin wall , is dead or dying .
