txt The picture that the President drew in his Worcester speech of the history of Federal taxes and other finances since the war and of their present state must be supplemented and modified in several important respects . " A Democratic Administration , " says the President , " provided sufficient " taxes to pay off the entire war debt " within ten or fifteen years . " But the subsequent Republican Administrations " reduced the taxes of their friends in " the higher brackets and left the na " tional debt to be paid by later gen " erations . Because they evaded their " obligations * * * the depression in " 1929 started with a $16,000,000,000 " handicap on us and our children . " In the fiscal year 1919 , Federal expenditures , because of the war , totaled $18,523,000,000 . After 1921 expenditures fell annually to below $4,000,000 , - 000 . Consequently , there was a demand in this period for lower taxes . Notwithstanding the tax reductions that were made , however , the public debt was reduced from $25,482,000,000 at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - 185,000,000 at the end of the 1930 fiscal year . This was a reduction of $9,297 , - 000,000 in a period of eleven years , or an average reduction of $845,000,000 a year . It is conceivable that debt reduction could have been made during that period at an even more rapid rate . As it was , however , the average annual debt reduction was greater than the total annual Federal expenditures for any year just preceding the war . The amount by which the debt was reduced in single years would have sufficed almost to wipe out the whole prewar Federal debt . When the depression came the Federal debt rose again to $22,539,000,000 at the end of the 1933 fiscal year . It now stands at $33,834,000,000 . The President asserted that the new undistributed profits tax on corporations is " merely an extension of the " individual Income Tax Law and a " plugging-up of the loopholes in it . " The majority of the Senate Finance Committee , after listening to- expert testimony on this point , concluded that the taxation of undistributed profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surtax avoidance in " orsier to reach a comparatively few " that are . " The President asserted that 98% per cent of all American corporations will pay a smaller normal corporation tax under the new law . This may be accurate , but the statement standing alone gives a misleading impression . The new Tax Law reduces normal taxes on corporations having net incomes of less than $40,000 . In 1933 , 941/z per cent of all corporations reported incomes of less than $50,000 . But the total income of these small corporations was only 143/4 per cent of all corporate income . In other words , the corporations that are not having normal taxes reduced are those that do approximately 85 per cent of the total corporate business of the country . Further , it does not follow that the total taxes even of these small corporations will be reduced . If they wish to build up reserves to become larger corporations , they may have higher taxes than before . The President declared in his Worcester speech that " taxes shall be levied according to ability to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many possible interpretations of it . In the United States , for example , our income tax , under both Republican and Democratic Administrations , has been primarily a class tax , paid by only about 4 per cent of the eligible voters . In Great Britain its base is far wider , and it is looked upon as the backbone of the revenue system .
