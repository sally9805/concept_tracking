In 1867 Alaska was called " Seward 's Folly " and " The Ice-Box of the North " because Secretary of State William Henry Seward bought the land from Russia for $7,200,000 ( 7 per acre ) and everyone knew it was a wasteland of ice and snow , inhabited only by wolves and Eskimos . <P> Last week Under Secretary of the Interior Harry Slattery defrosted the Ice-Box of the North . In 94 packed pages he reported to Secretary Harold L. Ickes that the planned development of Alaska " is an inescapable moral obligation " of the U. S. , that its 590,884 square miles are the " last frontier , " that U. S. economy and national defense demand its large-scale settlement , preferably by public-purpose corporations such as the East India Company that developed India for Great Britain , the Plymouth Company that developed the Indian-infested wilds of Massachusetts . <P> Although no hot-lipped trumpeter like his boss , Under Secretary Slattery released a report full of tall talk in Technicolor , pausing occasionally to put the blast on antique U.
