Russia 's current tidal wave of treason charges , summary arrests and sudden death to even big Bolsheviks ( TIME , Aug. 24 et seq. ) , surged up last week for the first time high enough to overwhelm even a president of a constituent republic of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics . <P> In their Moscow offices crack foreign correspondents discovered that much of the week 's most important news was being printed only in local Russian newsorgans in the regions where it occurred , sometimes even there in obscurest sheets . Thus at Minsk , capital of the White Russian* Soviet Socialist Republic , the important local newsorgan is the Star , but only in a Minsk paper called the Worker could one read last week the BIG STORY of how a three-day session of the White Russian Communist Party , devoted to frenzied charges and countercharges , had been capped by the sudden death of the White Russian President , Comrade Alexander Grigorevich Chervyakov . The Worker described President Chervyakov 's demise as " suicide for personal family reasons , " but it led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicly reviled for " letting Fascist termites devour the Party house in Minsk . " Apparently the reason why the Worker was able to scoop this story was that Editor Lentser of the rival Star had been thrown into jail as a " Fascist termite . " <P> Feverishly fingering through the Minsk Worker in Moscow , correspondents learned that in White Russia 998 ranking Communist Party members had been expelled as " hostile elements " and 31 more for " spreading Trotsky propaganda . " The Worker printed names of 141 persons classed in Minsk officially as " enemies of the people " - this stock phrase meaning in Russia today either that they are already in jail or that police are after them . <P> Definitely in jail were White Russia 's Commissars ( local cabinet ministers ) for Agriculture and Education-the former accused of " such treasonable acts as ordering wheat planted in apple orchards " - along with that most distinguished Bolshevik , Comrade Moisel Kalmanovich . He until two months ago was Commissar for State Grain and Livestock Farms for the entire Soviet Union , has now been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breeding bulls and inoculate cattle with cholera germs . Finally White Russia 's recently executed Red Army commander , General Ieronim Petrovich Uborevich , was described last week as having been " little short of a fiend incarnate , " while the railways , textile mills and collective farms of White Russia were reported " infested with Fascist spies and wreckers.
