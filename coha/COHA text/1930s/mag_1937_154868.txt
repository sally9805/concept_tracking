Farewell to Dynamite <P> THE HOUSE IN ANTIGUA-Louis Adamic-Harper ( $3 ) . <P> This time 33-year-old immigrant Author Adamic 's subject , lacking the autobiographical ties which have stimulated him in writing his previous books , handicaps him . As with The Native 's Return , his best-selling account of a revisit to his native Yugoslavia , Author Adamic wrote The House in Antigua as an accidental result of a pleasure trip to Guatemala in 1936 . His original purpose was merely " to get away from it all . " He picked Antigua , former capital of Guatemala , because friends rhapsodized over its ruins , and because he " had long been responsive to these lines in the second act of The Mikado : <P> There 's a fascination frantic In a ruin that 's romantic- " <P> Particularly he was told not to miss " the Popenoe place , " called the Casa del Capuchino . This was a 300-year-old Spanish house , in ruins since the destruction of Antigua by earthquake in 1773 , which had lately been restored by United Fruit Co. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Popenoe and his wife . Guest of Dr. Popenoe for two weeks , Author Adamic decided the house warranted a book . A further incentive arose from his enthusiastic agreement with United Fruit Co. ' s Managing Director Samuel Zemurray , who had said of the natives : " They 've got something , those people down there ; they 've got something . " Author Adamic 's enthusiasm runs to 300 pages ( illustrated ) , comprising a rather labored history of Antigua for the last 400 years , a mostly imaginary picture of the conquistadores who tenanted the Casa del Capuchino , a biography of the Popenoes , centring on capable Dorothy Popenoe , who supervised the main work of restoration until her death in 1932 from an attack of appendicitis , aggravated as a result of having eaten a tropical fruit ( akee ) being grown experimentally by her husband . <P> Only in the final paragraphs does the reader discover that Author Adamic intended to be more than picturesque . Here he reveals his real purpose : The Casa del Capuchino , says he , represents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Wreck . " Its restoration represents " what could be done with the Ruin . " Interesting for its contrast with Author Adamic 's earlier thoughts on the best way to clear " the Ruin " ( as set forth in his first book , Dynamite , a historical survey of labor violence in the U. S. ) this one will impress some readers as no less nave . As a device for jarring the reader out of that slightly dreamy state induced by travel books , the theory , coming where it does in The House in Antigua , is indisputably effective .
