THE higher we soar on the wings of science , the worse our feet seem to get tangled in the wires . ( You will have to imagine wires hanging down from the wings of science in order to get the image straight . ) Anyway , last week we noticed that the telephone ? which is a gift of science  --  reached new heights of intra-planetary non-communication . We refer to the telephone conversation between two doctors , one of whom was advising the other about a blood transfusion . Give the patient parent 's blood , he said over the phone . So the doctor gave the patient parrot 's blood . This incident reminded us strangely of the experience of a friend of ours who once reported a convention of dentists for a newspaper . He called up one of the dentists and asked what was going on . " Something very interesting , " the dentist replied . " We are having a most enlightening session on a mouth with pyorrhea . " Next day the newspaper cariried the report , written in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experimenting on a mouse with pyorrhea . The paper even sent a photographer . THROUGH a leak in the office of the Columbia Broadcasting System , we have come into possession of an unique document . It is a bulletin issued to all employees of the local station , in re the Old Gold account  --  which Columbia has just landed . The bulletin reads : " TO ALL EMPLOYEES . The OLD GOLD program over the entire Columbia System starts tonight . P. Lorillard &; Company , makers of OLD GOLD , are particularly appreciative of cooperation on the part of people with whom they do business and just asquick to resent lack of cooperation . All employees of this company , therefore , arc asked to remember that OLD GOLD again is one of our best clients . If you smoke we hope you smoke OLD GOLDS ? if not , please refrain from using other brands of cigarettes when representatives of the client or the agency arc present . " Publishing this bulletin is our contribution this week to Americana , or holonyana . The situation in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty good advertising ideas . We look for a new Chesterfield ad : " In an employee of WABC it 's CoOpe ration  --  in a cigarette it 's Taste . " And we certainly look for a Murad ad : " When you are caught smoking a Camel during the Lorillard hour , be nonchalant  --  light a Mu rad . " WE have been overtaken by the desire to keep a horse and carriage . It is the one gesture left for a resident of New York . Keeping a chorus girl is too stagy and mannered a way of life  --  a horse is the thing . These few rigs that we see around town impress us mighty much , if you want to know . They glide up and down the Avenue with an elegance pleasing to our Pepysian taste . Ownership of a horse and carriage must carry with it certain burdens , though , particularly on fete days . ' We can picture our apartment on our birthday  --  a morass of snaffle bits , horse blankets , cruppers , whips , foot-warmers , checkreins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriage lamps , blinders , and oats . If we could trust our friends , we would have a horse in an instant  --  if the horse would trust us . H ? W we 've chuckled , lately , at the prices the stores have been charging for everything . Shirts a dollar ninety-five , shoes seven-fifty . Good quality , too . It just goes to show that we were right in our suspicion about merchandise  --  nothing is worth what we used to pay , nothing really costs that much to make . Five dollars for a shirt , sixteen dollars for a pair of shoes ? we were living in a fairyland of exorbitance , called " prosperity . " Poverty is much better . The neatest little bargains we have come across in our wanderings have been those offered by the Studebaker Corporation of America , which has us wound around its little finger . They have been offering free jewelry with every used car . Some of the combinations are truly nifty : thus , you could get a Pierce-Arrow Model 80 ( looks welt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch ; " or an Auburn ' 29 sedan ( side mountings and trunk ) plus a superb solitaire selected for color and brilliance . The thing has us a little dizzy . A man of any character these days could set himself up for the rest of his life for a couple of farthings . AS to the Smedley-Cornelius-Benito affair , that spicy hit-and-run triangle , it is , to our mind , the perfect international situation : no matter how it comes out , we will be satisfied with the result . If Smedley , the Philadelphio-Nicaragua fire-eater , is made to eat his own words and burn his medals , that will be O.K. ; if young Master Vanderbilt , scion of Reno and white hope of the publishing business , turns out to have been a bad reporter ; that will be O.K. ; and if Italy 's man of iron turns out to be a hit-and-run driver , thus making a monkey out of Secretary Stimson for being so apologetic , that will be O.K. , too . Every way we look at it , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navy , thankful to have something really important to give its undivided attention to . Manna A RATHER romantic young fellow got into a devilishly embarrassing situation at the Grand Central Ter-minal the other afternoon . The one young lady who was important in his life was to leave for the West and he had made adequate preparations for her send-off . He arrived at the gates to the Twentieth Century with a whole armload of flowers , books , and candy , all beautifully wrapped up . Well , to make a sad story short , the young lady changed her mind at the last minute and did n't show up . He dashed up and down the platforms , in and out of the Pullmans of the various sections . His frenzied search terminated when the all-aboards were shouted . Then he realized fully the embarrassment of his predicament . Here he was with half a dozen packages of flowers , candy , and books , stranded . He could n't go out into the station again with them , past the gateman , who would probably laugh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trains began to move he rushed up to a young lady standing in the vestibule of one of the cars . He had n't , to his knowledge , ever seen her before in his life , but that did n't matter . He thrust the presents , all of them , into her arms , and in her astonishment she took them . " Goodbye , " he shouted throatily , " and have a good time . " Solution WELL , ladies and gentlemen , we present this week a solution to the Theatre Ticket Situation guaranteed to be better than any advanced in all these years and years by the theatre managers , Al Smith , the Actors ' Equity , and John S. Sumner . It is n't our own but we want to go down as having discovered it . It was thought out by a certain theatre in the 125th Street region , and it works thus : You go up to the box-office man and say you want seats . He says he has n't anything better than the sixteenth row . You say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better ones ? " He says yes , and hands you a couple in Row B or C and says the extra charge will be thirty-five cents each . As simple as that . New House WE tiptoed through the new Un- ion League Club building at Thirty-seventh and Park Avenue last week . It was about completed , but there were still panels to be put in and carpets to be laid . Six women were sitting on the floor in one of the rooms , sewing on a carpet , and we looked upon their presence as a symbol of the Great Change , which is , of course , that the new building has club space for ladies , an innovation which was put in practically over the dead bodies of some of the elder conservatives . Ladies enter through a special entrance in Park Avenue and are taken by a special elevator to the fourth floor , which is virtually all theirs . Here they have , among other things , a dining-room done in white mahogany and a smoking-room of knotty pine . We were told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can use their floor at all times but that husbands are permitted to enter only when invited by their wives . The lounge of the new club is on the mezzanine floor . The windows go all the way from the floor to the ceiling and the radiators have been recessed into the floor to give an unobstructed view from the chairs . There are twelve dining-rooms , including the public and private ones . The ceiling of the main one is plastered with acoustalith and the floor is of cork , to absorb sound . It seemed to us that men moving about would make so little noise they would be in danger of hearing feminine laughter from above-stairs . The art gallery is impressive , a steel humidor will keep the tobacco just right , and Turkish baths , a gymnasium , and squash courts have been included . The club has used most of its old furniture , plus a great deal of equally old furniture bought in England and Scotland by Benjamin Morris , the architect , who is a member . NE of the relics of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new building is an old-fashioned letter press that has been used for twenty-five years for the records of the club . Salesmen for more modern and efficient machines have tried to replace this in vain . Mr. Albert Robinson , assistant to the secretary , has guarded the letter press for a quarter of a century , through a number of hostile secretaryships . Five or six secretaries were elected who wanted to do away with the old press , but Mr. Robinson always won them over . One secretary held out for two years and then came to Mr. Robinson and said " Albert , I was wrong about that letter press . " In the last days of the Fifth Avenue building a salesman went into the club through the service entrance to see Mr. Robinson on business . When he was ready to leave , Mr. Robinson told him to go out the front door . " Just tell the doorman you have been up here seeing me , " he said . But as the gentleman started down the steps , Mr. Robinson called after him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " you had better just walk straight out and say nothing to the doorman. " dredth birthday that they are now a little at outs with their great-grandnephew because he has refused to take them to see the play " Five Star Final , " on the ground that they are too old . Besides the imputation of age , the refusal annoys them because they are related to the author of the play , Mr. Louis Weitzenkorn , this same great-grandnephew being his father . True Fresco MANY of the striking murals in the New School for Social Research in Twelfth Street were painted by a , man with only one hand . The other ; his left , was blown off in a chemical experiment when he was fifteen . The difficulties tinder which this artist , Jose Clemente Orozco , worked would have driven many two-handed painters crazy , for not only were forty or more workmen pounding and shouting around him while he painted , but he did the murals in " true fresco . " True frescoing is the hard and tedious process of painting murals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painter does his murals while the plaster is still wet , and thus , when they are done , they become more a part of the building than the plumbing . After a thousand years the frescoes in Twelfth Street , if there is a Twelfth Street then , will be even brighter than now , for old age improves the painted-in colors . Orozco worked eight hours a day for two months on the New School walls . He had to have a plasterer work with him every day . Each morning this workman would plaster as much of a wall as the artist expected to cover that day  --  sometimes forty square feet , sometimes forty square inches , depending on the amount of detail . The work was slow , for every brush stroke had to he pressed in with a trowel . If something had gone wrong the whole section would have had to be scraped out and the wall replastered . Orozco was lucky . He did n't have to do over any of the eight hundred square feet of wall space he covered . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frescoing . The art is , of course , centuries old and he got the idea of reviving it when , some years ago , he stumbled upon some Mexican stonemasons practicing the technique in a crude form . Here and there a painter has dabbled in the process , but Orozco is regarded as its foremost expert here . He did a thousand square feet on the walls of Pomona College in California . When college officials told him they did n't have a fund for the work , he simply asked " Well , have you got a wall ? " and went to work  --  for expenses only . He also did the Twelfth Street walls for expenses only . He has recently accepted , however , several extremely well-paying commissions . He has also rejected several  --  did n't like the ideas . He believes painters should be workmen and deal with social problems , not with nudes , apples , and mysticism . Orozco is a stocky man with a great square-jawed face and peers through thick glasses . He looks like a revolutionary , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that time are said to have made and unmade cabinets . He helped organize an artists ' syndicate in Mexico , whose members worked on public projects for ordinary workmen 's wages . He has been in the States for three years . In New York he lives in a bare apartment in the Forties , without a telephone . Grammar and Banana Splits APrinceton a few weeks ago there was quite a bit of fuss in Ye Tavern , a tea shoppe where bachelor professors and undergraduates often take their meals . About its little tables-fortwo the management had distributed new doilies , daintily done in red and white and bearing this legend : " It is always our pleasure to better serve our patrons . We welcome your suggestions . " About thirty patrons firmly made the same suggestion during the next five or six days : that the split infinitive he corrected . It has been . New doilies were rushed through the printer 's and Ye Tavern has been saved from ruin . Wrecker 's Reminiscences ONE of our assistants has interviewed a house-wrecker . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , money , jewels , and so on , left by people moving out . The wrecker said no ; that he had found lots of things but precious little treasure . In thirty years of wrecking he remembered only three instances of finding anything which might be so classed . One was in 1909 , when they tore down the old Arena Restaurant in West Thirty-first Street . The proprietors had been the Muschenheim brothers , who also owned the Hotel Astor , and the wreckers discovered that they had had a silver dollar set into the structure , just for luck , whenever any alterations were made . The wrecking company did n't get much work done the first few days ; the men were too busy roaming about the building , hunting out silver dollars and prying them loose . They found twenty in all . Another time , in a private dwelling , men ripped open a wall-safe and found forty thousand dollars in securities . They returned it to the owners , who had n't yet missed it and were grateful . Again , when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully collected all the soot in the great chimney of the building . They got from it four thousand dollars ' worth of gold , carried off with the smoke from the smelting furnaces . One find they made which would have been almost as valuable as buried treasure today was in 1906 , when they tore clown the Ely School , which had stood for more than a hundred and fifty years at Eighty-sixth Street and Riverside Drive . When they took the building apart they discovered that the framework was of massive oak timbers , hand-hewn , intricately mortised and pegged together  --  not a nail in the whole structure . Country-house builders would pay a lot for such materials nowadays , but at that time nobody had gone in for antique effects , so the timbers were just taken out and burned . Once in a while the wreckers find valuables which tenants had meant to leave behind . Some years ago they razed a large mansion in Fifth Avenue . Entering it , they found a portrait left staring down from a wall in an otherwise vacant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the seventies , and was obviously a pretty valuable painting . They shipped it off to the former owners of the house . The family did n't thank them . Turned out it was a portrait of a very wealthy aunt , who had died and left them quite out of her will . Reveille POSTAL gets you theatre tickets , but Western Union will wake you up in the morning . The charge is twenty cents . A man found out about this service the other night when he wanted to be sure to get up in time to catch an early train . He phoned Western Union and dictated a telegram to himself reading " Joe Blank : Get up and catch that train . Joe Blank . " He told the clerk who took down the message that it must be delivered to him at 7:30 A.M. At this point , she exTHE NEW YORKER plained that he did n't have to send the message at all , that Western Union would take care of waking him by phone if he gave his phone number , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system  --  free -- but it requires a solicitous friend who gets to work before you do . We learned about it by overhearing a conversation on a bus one morning . Two girls were talking . " So Ruby  --  you know Ruby , " said one . " Well , she has to get to her office half an hour before me , so on the way she stops in at a drugstore and calls me up on a pay-station phone . Well , the phone rings and I know it 's Ruby , so I get up , but I do n't answer it and she gets her nickel back . See ? " Sec ? Bandsman IF you 've seen " The New Yorkers " you 'll remember the great big dominoes that light up in the orchestra . They are made out of cake pans . Fred Waring , the orchestra leader , used to work in a bakery greasing cake pans . Now he has one of the most successful orchestras in the country . Think of that . All such orchestras develop in about the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell about . Waring left the bakery in Tyrone , Pennsylvania , where he was working odd hours , to enter Penn State to study architecture , but found he was much better at the banjo and the musical saw . Even so he was n't good enough for the college glee club . He tried to get on it for three years and failed . Last October his band gave two concerts of an hour each in the college chapel  --  which proves something . His first orchestra consisted of two banjoists , a drummer , and a pianist , and it played around at small dances . When he left college , he took with him a band of ten . That was eight years ago . Nine of the men are still with him in an orchestra that now numbers twenty-two men and three girls . To get in the orchestra you must be young , a collegian , and not bald . None of the original group has become bald . Waring does not know what he would do about it if one did . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one of a couple hundred thousand college-boy orchestras , and it went broke every year , usually around Lent . This happened in Jamestown , New York , once and there was just enough money in the crowd for coffee . The wife of one of the musicians swiped some doughnuts from a bakery , and they had doughnuts too . Of course what sets one American orchestra off from another is not music , but novelty effects . Waring is fine at thinking up novelty effects , like the cake-pan dominoes . He thinks them up while walking in Central Park , and jots them down . It was at his first engagement after leaving college that some such novelty effect knocked a Detroit audience cold and resulted in bigger and better engagements for the Waring orchestra . Now they have been featured or starred in a movie , in musical comedies , and at Les Ambassadeurs in Paris . Mr. Waring is natural , not mar-celled . He practically never wears a hat . He does n't drink or smoke , but drives his automobile very fast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stern prohibitionist and church worker . The two get along very well , avoiding such topics as musical comedies , church work , and monkey business with lighted cake pans . Just Lonesome A PATIENT kindergarten teacher was trying to explain the difference between what is round and what is square to her impatient pupils one day , using a ball and a playing block . She would pick up the ball and say , slowly and distinctly : " This is round . " Then she would put it down , pick up the block , and say : " This is square . " Heroically , she repeated this exercise seven or eight times . " This is round , " she said finally , " and this is square . Now are there any questions ? " One little boy who had just joined the class raised his hand , and she nodded to him . " Can I sit in your lap ? " he asked .
