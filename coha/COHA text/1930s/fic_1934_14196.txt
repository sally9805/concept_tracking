IN A sort of valley close by the white folks ' town is a Negro settlement , formerly known as Potter 's Field . It was so called after a wealthy planter named Potter who owned it before the Civil War . The field was always a waste place , cut with gulleys , full of briars , stones , and garbage , and in the parlance of that section fit only to help hold the world together . When the Negroes were freed from slavery , many of them squatted on this spot and gradually built up a kind of hog-dump colony of their owning . Later on , old Potter 's nephew questioned their titles and brought them into court , and thereupon they began paying rent from their wash and hoe money . When at last it was generally understood what Potter 's Field meant in the Bible , many of the more respecting inhabitants got together and restyled the place Johnstown after one of their native sons , a designation not generally adopted to this day . This Johnson was a bound boy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself a college education and a sort of M.D. degree and returned home a middle-aged man to practice his calling in his native place . Battling the tide of poverty , dirt , and disease , he soon wore himself out in the struggle and died before he was old . Some of the homefolks then honored him by naming their little town after him , as aforesaid , at the same time trying to dispense with a term that was falling more and more into disfavor . Many laborers have come recently into this place  --  from different parts of the state , some from neighboring states  --  for the building of new institutions up in the town  --  warehouses and college buildings . They herd together here , sleeping and eating as best they can . In the evenings you will find them laughing , singing , and sitting before the shacks with their girls , or walking out if the weather is fine towards the hilly fields that lie west of the town . Swarms of kinky-headed children shoot marbles or roll battered automobile tires along the crooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and look on in awe and innocence as Belle 's sweetheart from Raleigh comes cadillacking along in his wire-wheeled Ford . The sport calls to a girl sitting in the yard with a man , and she rises and goes with him . Her companion left alone growls to himself and registers an oath on high that he too will ride like that some day , goddam he will . But he wo n't , for the crapshooters know his soul . On the porch of old Quiviene Lockley 's shack across the street sits Ed Uzzell , a man past fifty , with his head bent despondently in his hands . Bad Ed he had been called in the old Memphis days . Bootleg liquor , women and cards have caved him in . He looks out towards the west where the sun is setting behind the smokestacks of the cotton mill and hums a song to himself about Brady , the rounder , who broke the hearts of the women in Gawgy . He too was like that once . And remembering the girl in Winston-Salem and the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his chair and spits softly into the yard . UZZELL ( Thinking . ) After a life of fun and sweet momma from Louisville to Mobile , this swinging a pick in a ditch for two bucks a day and all the manhood gone out of you is a hell of a way to end . And then too them white men stand round in their collars and tell you what to do  --  Jesus !  --  The big bugs come down from Durham and Raleigh and the Lord knows where , rolling around in their Packards and Buicks and Lincolns . They walk about with the big boss and point with their canes . Great God A'mighty ! And sometimes their women come with them , tripping over ditches and piled out earth with little trim feet , prattling in baby voices about the warehouses going up . They look with round possessive eyes at their men , captains of industry and the big wheel , their small heads rising out of smotherly furs like lovely dolls . And all the while Bad Ed is digging far below in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from seven to twelve , from one to six , twirling the iron-snouted pick above his head and driving it straight home.Spitting again , Uzzell gets up , takes a step or two and then reseats himself with his head in his hand , his mind black and turmoiling.The sun goes down , other boarders come out of the house and join him on the porch . They light their pipes and cigarettes , they talk a bit now and then . Ever and anon the spurt of a match lights up a face , and the coal of a smoker glows and subsides like a dull intermittent firefly . Far down an alley a guitar goes thrumming , a man 's muffled growl following along with something about how the Red River runs from his back door to Lord knows where ; then presently nearer at hand the husky voice of a woman calling  --  " Oh where is my loving daddy gone ? " The sounds up and down the street grow softer , come less often , and quiet settles over the sort of town . The boarders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motionless silence . Each grows busy with his thoughts of tomorrow and yesterday and each withdraws into the sanctuary of himself . Soon they will get up one by one , " See you tomorrow , " and mosey off to their bug-ridden beds in different parts of the valley . p. 3 UZZELL ( To himself . ) Ignorant and blind ! Under the tight pot I hear you calling.Or if it is winter the Negroes in Potter 's Field huddle indoors , breathing the close and suffocating air . The broken pane is stuffed with pillows and rags , and pasteboard nailed over the cracks in the walls . But rags and paper wo n't stop the wide leaks in the sagging roof . Sleets and rains seep through and wet the sleepers in their beds , and then pneumonia and galloping consumption rot out their lungs . The gasp of the dying child and the groan of the laborer struggling in his bed are too frequently heard , and Jim Farr 's run-down hearse is seen rattling off to the graveyard many times too often.Again things other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malignant devil were sicking them on to blood and murder . And some of them even believe there are wandering niggers much like the devil whose souls are given over to evil , and wherever they go trouble follows . Listen close at night , they say , and one can be heard passing along the road , singing to himself  --  Done sold my soul to the Devil , And my heart 's done turned into stone . And it wo n't be long before somewhere somebody will pull out a knife or a pistol and put daylight through a man . Then a heavy tramp will sound on the porch , a loud whamming on the door , and the voice of the law will call out , " Heigh , I say , heigh there !  --  p. 4 UZZELL ( To himself . ) Oh Cap'n , Cap'n , take that body away !  --  It is a sultry Saturday afternoon in early summer , and a group of Negroes are sprawling around old Quiviene 's front porch , dozing , laughing , singing in relaxation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's work is done . The shack of a house , with a drunken chimney at the right , is set diagonally across a little yard ; and beyond , a narrow alley runs at right angles to it . Tacked on a post near the steps at the center is a plank sign  --  " Lockley 's Bording Hous . " A thick cypress vine , lacy-leaved and with scarlet tubular flowers , overruns the left end of the porch and house and hangs down along a windowed shed room built in the side somewhat farther back . A smaller shack is a step away at the left  --  not much larger than a good-sized dog kennel but proclaiming in crooked letters on its front that it is " Parr 's Shavin Parler , " At the right a path leads in from the alley to the porch steps , and growing near it to the front is a small thick china tree . Along the path and here and there in the yard are borders and beds of purplish red petunias with zinnias and marigolds planted among them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the flowers and cypress vine  --  yellow , orange , purple , and scarlet  --  which seems to increase the already intense heat of the summer day . Somewhere far off at the right an intermittent blasting in the earth goes on . Nearer , children are heard screaming at play , and now and then a sleepy inhabitant of the valley wanders aimlessly by in the alley at the right . Levin Farrow , a restless alert young fellow , and quick on the call , is standing by a low stake near the china tree with two horseshoes in his hand . He has been addressing one of his vulgar stories to the boarders on the porch who for the moment are interrupting him with their laughter . p. 5 QUIVIENE ( A slatternly gray-haired woman about sixty years old sitting in a chair near the door that leads into the house . ) That ai n't fitten for women-folks to hear , Levin . ( But still she looks interested and takes a large dip of snuff with her brush in anticipation . ) GRAY ( A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the porch at the right dangling her feet down . ) Pshaw , women-folks know more'n men , Aunt Quivie . ( She smiles broadly at Farrow , revealing a row of pearly teeth set off by a gleaming gold one in the corner of her dimpled mouth . ) FARROW Then uh  --  uh , one night when they were feeling for Jesus with the lights blowed out , them two preachers got to working on her tin britches with can openers . Hah-hah-hah . ( The boarders on the porch laugh and slap each other , and even Uzzell who is sitting at the right bent over in his chair lets out a twisting smile . The fun suddenly dies out of Farrow 's countenance and for an instant he raises his face to the sky and gives a high-calling Negro " holler "  --  oodle  --  oodle  --  oo ! He listens a moment as if expecting a voice to answer him from the deep above , and then from the deep bowels of the earth far away the blasting does seem to reply to him. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question up to heaven ! Wherefore ? But the earth do answer him . ( Farrow and all the others listen intently a moment . ) FARROW ( With a touch of uncertainty in his voice . ) Dynamite on the big road , children , having a word with man .

( Letting fly his horseshoe , he slaps himself in triumph at the result . ) Hot damn , a ringer ! ( Bad-Eye Smith , who is sitting on a blacksmith 's anvil near the china tree , bent under an old felt hat , shifts himself around and stares quietly at the stake . Farrow sets himself and throws the second shoe which knocks down the first . ) PARR ( Who is sitting in a chair before his barber shop and finishing some sandwiches from a greasy paper bag . ) Yeh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of biscuit . ) Harr  --  p ! ( Parr is a squatty black fellow of middle age , dressed in a dirty barber 's coat . The stems of his waxed and rolled mustache protrude on either side of his nose like a pair of steer horns , and he is ever petting and fingering them . Farrow moves over , gets the shoes and begins throwing them back to the first stake. ) p. 7 STERLING ( A strong , handsome young mulatto of twenty-eight , sleepily and reminiscent as he lies on the porch at the right by Milly Wilson 's side . ) Knowed of a man in Mobile could ring ' em forty times in a row .

( Willie shuts the door at the front , blows out the light , takes off his shoes and trousers and crawls into bed with her . The room is dark , save for a dim trickle of moonlight that comes in from under the eaves of the porch . Bantam 's caressing voice , broken by Milly 's low sobs , is heard from the shed-room as the convict goes to his long awaited rest . Milly 's sobs gradually die away to low moans , and presently Bantam is heard snickering , even giggling . Milly 's moans also gradually take on a different tone . ) WILLIE Forgot my prayers .

The curtain rises revealing the shadowy lump of Quiviene 's boarding house bathed in the silvery radiance of the moonlight . Somewhere in the night a mockingbird is chirping out his light but melancholy note . A moment passes and then Bad-Eye comes wandering in from the left thrumming his Jew's-harp . He stops and stands eyeing the house . SMITH ( Calling to the house as if it were a man . ) Heigh ! ( He listens a moment . ) Heigh ! ( Plucking his harp . ) Where that preacher man ?

The blasting is heard in the distance again . ) WILLIE ( Inside the house  --  throwing the cover from his head . ) Ooh , that old blasting ! p. 86 QUIVIENE ( Pulling him back . ) I take care of you , honey . ( They lie wrapped in each other 's embrace under the sheet . The sounds in the house die away . Presently Farrow comes stepping into the yard from the right . He beckons behind him , and Zeb Vance and Flossie Tucker come in , holding each other by the hand , Flossie now and then giving her high suppressed giggle . Farrow goes up on the porch and knocks at the door . Willie is heard whining in fright . ) FARROW Nobody but Levin , Aunt Quivie !

Pacing up and down a moment undecidedly , he raises his voice in his lonely " holler " and goes away in the direction he came . Zeb Vance walks around the room , waiting for somebody to say something . ) QUIVIENE For Jesus ' sake quit that walking . Both of you fools , go on to bed . Know what 's in your minds . ( Flossie gives her foolish giggle and Zeb Vance takes up the lamp . He latches the door , and he and Flossie go into the shed at the rear . The light streams in partially illuminating old Quiviene 's room . The bride and groom begin to undress in embarrassment . Flossie continues to give her foolish giggle . Presently Zeb Vance blows out the light and pulls Flossie down to him . A moment passes , and Tom Sterling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shirt . He tiptoes over and stands by the window to Milly 's room , pressing himself flat against the wall and listening . He wags his head in pain and after a while moves his hand along the sill and pushes the window around on its hinges . The moonlight shines into the room. ) p. 89 MILLY ( Within . ) Must be the wind . ( But there is no answer from Bantam . Sterling stands still as a statue as he waits , looking like a dark bronze bas-relief against the house . The round gleaming barrel of a pistol is gradually pushed out over the window sill from within . It stops as if surveying the scene with its round hole of an eye . Then in the shadow of the room behind it the dim outline of Bantam 's head and shoulders rise , stopping and then rising a bit more . ) BANTAM ( With a low chuckle . ) Yeh , a little breeze . ( He reaches up cautiously to close the window , when Sterling suddenly sticks his hand out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milly lets out a loud scream , and Bantam is heard struggling and cursing around the room .

( Zeb Vance rushes in from the shed , half-dressed and carrying a lamp . The light pours out over Bantam 's body twisting in agony . ) QUIVIENE ( With a loud cry . ) Help , help ! p. 90 BANTAM ( Gasping for breath , his voice already gurgling in a death choke . ) Where is he ? ( Crawling along the porch . ) Jesus , gim me a chance at him !

Henry throws up his head with a half snarl , and Sterling marches him to the right as if to meet their doom . And now with a low sardonic chuckle as if releasing the evil of his whole inner nature , Henry moves ahead of him . A great wind begins to blow through Potter 's Field , the china free is twisted in its grip , the houses shake , sag and sway , and with the whistle of an oncoming shell a terrific blast goes off in the center of the scene . The pallid light of the moon mixes in with the turmoil as Quiviene 's house totters and falls . Then the light goes out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we see a few of the terrified inhabitants of the valley flying across the scene like stray autumn leaves in a storm. ) @x THE light comes up again into the bright glare of a day in August . It is a few weeks later . Eight or ten striped convicts in the right background are digging on the blazing new road that runs through Potter 's Field  --  Henry , stouter and more lusty-hearted , digging ahead , all swinging their picks aloft and bringing them down together . Bad-Eye 's truck is drawn up in the alley back of the wrecked boarding-house , and Quiviene , Willie , and Milly are loading their household goods into it preparatory to moving away . The white dust is thick as a haze in the air , resting like a cement dew on the ruined zinnia and marigold beds . The heat of August shimmers across the land as far as the eye can see . Lazy Lawrence dances his fiendish monkey dance . The sweat pours down , the only dampness in the world for the ten mourners on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squats , drowsy , vapid , like a toad . The rifle in the crook of his arm keeps alert , its muzzle warns like an eye , it threatens . On the bankside to the right another guard sits . He also is sleepy , drowsy . His rifle also keeps alert and watches , its muzzle threatens . The convicts dig with their backs to the guards , their faces set down the infinite stretch of road . Like soulless puppets , they lift their hands towards the sky and bring them down , never any slower , never any faster . And as the picks come down against the earth with a thud , a husky desperate groan bursts from their baked lips . As rhythmic as the beating of their hearts the " hanh ! " accompanies the falling of the picks , carrying over long maddening hours of pain until the sun sinks cooling in the west and the guard stirs and says , " Call it a day . " At times their voices are raised in a chant , level , patient , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes they talk as they work , but not so often , for the staccato of conversation breaks up the rhythmic routine of labor and that 's what they 're here for  --  labor , labor , working on the roads . " Ten years on the roads , Tom Sterling , alias Red Murdock , and twenty years for you , Jack Bolis , alias the Reverend John Henry . " The judge dropped his tobacco by his foot , rose , addressed the jury , and gave sentence . " These niggers , these everlasting niggers , always fighting , always shooting , always killing . They 've got no sense . They 'll never have no sense . Peace  --  peace , I say . The law  --  the law ! For this is the republic , these the institooshuns . " Henry 's spirit still walks unbroken . Sterling 's has gone under . The feel of iron and abuse of tongues have broken him . His great shoulders are bent , his legs hardly sustain his weight , and his arms fling up the pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , with slowly decreasing power . And all the while his lightless face stares at the earth beneath . HENRY ( Driving in his pick , the monosyllables dropping at slow intervals from his lips , as if they had no meaning other than their sound . ) Dig-dig-dig-hanh  --  dig-dig-hanh  --  ( The guard at the right stirs in his sleepiness and beats at the flies with his hat. ) p. 104 FIRST GUARD Rain or shine , the old dog-flies stay with you .

Put some pep in that digging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little digging done . ( They lapse into silence again . The second guard stretches his arms in a yawn . ) SECOND GUARD Lord , I 'm sleepy  --  sleepy . FIRST GUARD Better leave her off a few nights . ( There is a snickering among the convicts . ) SECOND GUARD ( Brutally , his voice sharp with hate . ) Somebody begging for the little rawhide ! ( The convicts , terrified , drive their picks deeper into the earth but never any slower , never any faster . Milly with the one remaining baby in her arms comes around from behind old Quiviene 's house and stands on the edge of the road-cut . Bad-Eye is with her , his face full of sorrow . He stands swaying his body from side to side in a restless ape-like motion. ) p. 105 SMITH ( Softly . ) Tom , Tom .

FIRST GUARD Goddamned water boy 's fell in and drownded . ( Standing up and calling . ) Water boy , water jack ! Could a-been there and half-way back . ( The convicts begin a wordless hum that rises like a dry gusty breathing from their mouths , pitiful and pleading . ) HENRY ( In a wooden voice . ) Mercy , mercy , it calls . Water , water ! Give them water ! ( The hum of the convicts faintly increases its volume. ) p. 106 FIRST GUARD Go to it , preacher , get this road built . Wheels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

A convulsive shudder runs through the other convicts , save Henry . All keep to their digging , never any faster , never any slower , their faces set down the infinite stretch of road before them . Only their humming increases in volume , full of begging , full of pain . With a cry Milly runs in . Quiviene with her arms around the frightened Willie is seen behind her . Still clasping her baby , Milly tries to make her way over to Sterling , but the first guard pushes her back with his rifle , and she stands among the loose clods , an anguished moaning coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Marching up to the prostrate body . ) Get that mouth out'n the dirt .

SECOND GUARD ( Raising the strap above his head . ) Thirty-nine , thirty-nine . ( His voice comes out stronger now , more sharply , strengthened by the strap in hand . ) The law , the law !

The humming of the convicts rises higher and louder with sorrow  --  full of hate also , full of its deep begging , but helpless withal . ) HENRY ( Suddenly beginning to sing as he wags his head and drives his pick deep into the earth . ) They call their sister  --  hanh  --  They say their sister  --  hanh  --  They mean their sister  --  hanh  --  Eigh Lord .

( He cuffs him gently in the collar , then with more insistence , at last with vehement roughness . A low whine , different from the convict hum , is heard. ) p. 109 FIRST GUARD ( Bending down . ) Goddamn it , we 'll see ! SECOND GUARD And what song is he singing now ? FIRST GUARD Do n't say nothing . Grunts and slobbers like an old steer . He do n't say nothing . MILLY ( Horror pouring from her breaking heart . ) Jesus ! Jesus ! SECOND GUARD By God , we 'll see !  --  Oh yes , he 'll talk . He 'll tell us a mouthful .

( The second guard hands his rifle to the first and then looking around the world as if for a witness of justification , begins to beat the prostrate figure . The humming of the convicts now is a shuddering groan . They drive their picks deeper into the ground , but never any faster , never any slower. ) p. 110 HENRY ( Singing . ) They call their mother  --  hanh  --  They say their mother  --  hanh  --  SECOND GUARD Six-seven-eight  --  nine-ten  --  FIRST GUARD And now you 'll work  --  and I reckon you 'll work .

FIRST GUARD Oh , yes , he 'll work , and I reckon he 'll work ! ( Doodle , the water boy , bursts through the hedge of dead trumpet vines at the left , stands a moment terror-stricken , and then dropping his bucket with a clatter tears down the road . The Negroes of the settlement stand huddled behind the house and in the alley . Their mourning song , much like the hum of the convicts , is faintly heard coming from their throats. ) p. 111 HENRY Grave , grave , swallow them up , hide them away , till the next harvest , keep them .  --  Dig  --  dig  --  dig  --  dig  --  hanh  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( In a last burst of life Sterling staggers to his feet . ) FIRST GUARD Go to work  --  Look out !

( The first guard stands stupefied . Then as if suddenly awakening , he steps back , raises his rifle and shoots Sterling through the back . He rolls over and lies with his face upturned in the burning sun . Milly suddenly lets her arms with the crying baby drop to her lap and sits cold and still . Down the alleys the Negroes are seen on their knees crushed and stupefied , their arms wrapped across their breasts , their heads bent down . The first guard stands looking foolishly down at the dead Negro . ) HENRY Sing on  --  sing on  --  beaten  --  darkness  --  night  --  God sits on high , his face from the Negro .

The buzzard roosting on the throne of God . And they sing , and they sing . Earth give answer ! Jesus hear them ! ( Shaking his great head savagely , sweeping his pick over the scene and driving it to the eye . ) Dig-dig-dig-hanh ! ( He steps boldly forward on the road , digging as he goes . By this time the convicts have dug along the road half-way across the scene , Henry always several steps ahead .

The pleaders in the alley still bow on their knees , their hands beating the air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips move , but now no sound is heard coming from them . Suddenly the second guard bursts into loud sobs and flings himself down on his face in the grass . Milly with her wailing baby in her arms drags her broken form over to Sterling 's body and lays herself across it , pressing her silent lips against his face . Uzzell suddenly springs down into the road , seizes Sterling 's pick , and takes his place next to Henry. ) p. 113 UZZELL ( His voice bursting from his lips in a trumpet cry . ) Dig on the road to heaven !

And they sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more loudly . ) They mean King Jesus , hanh  --  Eigh Lord !
