Ad Universam Creaturam : " Quia arcano Dei consilio succedimus in locum Principis Apostolorum , corum nempe quorum doctrina et praedicatio jussu divino ad omnes gentes et omnem creaturam destinata est et quia primi in loco ipso mira sane ope Marconiana uti fruipossumus , ad omnia et omnes primo nos convertimus , atque , his et infra , sacro textu juvante , dicimus : <P> " ' Aduite caeli quae loquor , audiat terra verba oris mei . <P> " ' Audite haec omnes gentes , auribus percipite omnes qui habitatis orbem , simul in unum dives et pauper . <P> " ' Audite insulae et attendite populi de longe ad Deum . . . . ' " <P> All Creation , save Russians and savages listened raptly to the tremulous Latin of Pope Pius 261st authentic Roman Pontiff , when last week he inaugurated Vatican City 's radio broadcasting Station HVJ . The Soviet Government had for bidden Soviet stations ' rebroadcasting the speech . The savages lacked receiving sets . But all other peoples hearkened . Devout Catholics fell to their knees at the radioed sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , musing on the significance of this most modern manifestation of Roman Catholic extension . <P> The date was Feb. 12-Lincoln 's Birthday for some 123,000,000 U.

( time differential between Rome and Washington , six hours ) . <P> The Pope 's red motor car carried him , seated in his gilded , damask-covered motor throne , from the Vatican Palace , over the graveled roads of the Vatican gardens to the small , redbrick , garden-surrounded broadcasting station . <P> Guglielmo Marconi , inventor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ builder of station HVJ , great &; good friend of His Holiness , fell to his knees , kissed the papal ring . The Pope was smiling , showed traces of excitement . The Mar chese Marconi and entourage entered the small building over a thick red-and-blue carpet . Whimsically His Holiness threw in switches which set electrical devices in motion ; he tapped a wireless key , punched a teletypewriter 's keys , proceeded to the transmitting room where from a throne he spoke to All Creation . <P> At first his voice trembled with both the novelty and the import of the occasion . Quickly , however , his cadenced Latin gained measured speed . Latin adepts had difficulty keeping up with his racing thoughts and Italian pronunciation . As soon as he finished , translators , who had stood by him , vernacularized in English , German , French , Italian , Spanish , Polish the substance of his message which began :
