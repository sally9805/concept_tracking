ANOTHER CAESAR-Alfred Neumann-Knopf ( $3 ) . <P> Louis Napoleon , nephew of the great Napoleon , spent some 35 years attempting to become Emperor of the French . He finally succeeded . But according to Historian Philip Guedalla he should have died on the day of his coronation . For the story which Guedalla told in his The Second Empire is one of anticlimax , of a nouveau riche court , a theme for irony and wisecracks , the Napoleonic legend reduced to farce . " The gaslit tragedy of the Second Empire , " Guedalla contemptuously called the regime which was born in intrigue in the early 1850 's , found its Empress in the granddaughter of a foreign keeper of a wine shop , and collapsed in a shambles when Bismarck and Moltke sent their crack Prussians into France in 1870 . <P> Alfred Neumann , German historical novelist , has evidently pondered Guedalla 's book . Preferring heroics to irony , and following the career of a man who is one of the " outs , " to satirizing the bigwigs of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis Napoleon in the early ' 50 's . Another Caesar is the prelude to the " gaslit tragedy . " It is a big , colorful , shrewd novel that sticks pretty closely to the actual course of history . Conversations may be invented , but the characters are all out of the past . And Neumann 's analysis of personality and motive is strictly in accordance with the probabilities . His Louis Napoleon is the real Louis Napoleon , a mixture of clownishness , perseverance , luck and good judgment . <P> The story of the illegal search for political mastery followed the same course in the mid-19th Century that it follows today . Like Adolf Hitler , Louis Napoleon staged his own opra boufle " beer hall putsch . " Louis ' fiasco consisted of a ridiculous attempt to rally the garrison town of Strasbourg behind him for an invasion of Louis Philippe 's France . And , like Hitler , Louis spent a period in jail , at the French fortress of Ham , where he managed to be solaced by his serving maid . Again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President of the short-lived Second French republic ( the equivalent of Hitler 's term of office under Hindenburg ) , of taking over some of the elements of Socialism into the new State which he promised . Where Hitler got the Socialist planks for the " National Socialist " platform from the hated German Marxians , Louis got his ideas from Louis Blanc , French radical . And to carry out his ideas , Louis had to banish recalcitrant politically-minded poets like Victor Hugo , even as Hitler had to banish writers like Lion Feuchtwanger . Some people , indeed , have seen in Louis Napoleon the father of the modern " planned State , " have even called him " the first Fascist . "
